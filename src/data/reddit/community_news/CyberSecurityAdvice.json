But if they don’t, you will be disappointed. \nI wanted to be a Public Affairs Officer; my degrees were in Poly Sci and Int’l Relations…and guess what, I became a cyber officer. Probably happened because I was a comm-electronics tech in the 90s, but nevertheless, that’s what the USAF wanted from me. \n\nSo, set your expectations accordingly. Just because you have academic experience doesn’t mean you’re guaranteed the career field you want. Talk to a recruiter and understand whatever is offered carefully before you sign paperwork.\n\nSavvy? Aim High",

This all may depend on the job, space force also seems less likely to deploy anywhere crazy (cept Tampa, FL lol) and probably has more opportunities to promote.  If I had to do it, I would do a cyber specific role with the space force.\n\nI work cybersecurity and did a technical role in the military and know a lot of others from various branches that did the same.  My consensus is that a lot of US military technical training usually sucks unless they have a purchased program from some vendor like GIAC, otherwise it can be a crapshoot where they're forced to complete certifications/training at a set pace really fast.  If you're a go-getter and self study, you can make up that gap, but the general intention for almost all roles, even those with high asvab is to specialize them and dumb the job down as much as possible so that the operational aspect of it is easier.\n\nThis leads to things like IT admins and helpdesk people that just reset AD creds all day long, but dont really know what AD is or the inner workings, cyber specialists that'll look at a specific vendor interface and escalates all medium level alerts.  The more technical deep dives almost always go to a civilian contractor.  There are definitely the handful that know what they are doing but aren't really allowed to deep dive either, you'll have technicians who could change out a part on something to get it operational, but the military doesn't wanna chance those guys and would usually just opt to replace a whole board or component via purchase something from Lockheed at ten grand instead when it could have been less than a dollar to fix sometimes.

          "text": "Given your background, you're honestly in a great position for either branch, but there are some meaningful differences worth considering.\n\nSpace Force is doing something pretty interesting with their cyber career path right now. They're shifting away from the traditional time-in-grade promotion model toward demonstrated competency levels (basic, senior, master).   \nWhat this means practically is that your existing certs and master's degree could potentially accelerate your progression more than in the Air Force's more traditional structure. They're also integrated their cyber squadrons directly with their Space Deltas, so you'd be doing mission defense work that's immediately tied to space operations rather than broader Air Force missions.\n\nThe catch? Space Force only has around 4,900 enlisted personnel total right now. That's tiny.   \nSo while you might face less competition and get more specialized experience, you also have fewer bases, fewer assignment options, and the career field is still being built out.   \nSome people love being part of something this new and having that kind of impact on how things develop. Others prefer more established structure.\n\nAir Force cyber is more mature and has way more positions and locations. They also have the Cyber Direct Commissioning Program that could actually be relevant for you – it lets experienced cyber professionals come in as officers with constructive service credit based on your education and certs.   \nWith your credentials, you might enter as a Lieutenant or higher rather than starting from scratch. That's a pretty significant advantage if you're 25 and want to fast-track your military career alongside your civilian cyber experience.\n\nHonestly, I'd reach out to recruiters from both branches and specifically ask about the officer route given your master's degree and certs.   \nYour profile seems better suited for commissioning than enlisting, and the conversation might look totally different.",

With Space Force being so new and so small, you can get alot of amazing opportunities (certifications, training, TDYs etc.) that would just not happen in the Air Force.\n\n\nIf you only want to do cyber, I would lean more towards the Space Force. Theres only 3 potential jobs (Cyber, Intel, Space Operator) vs in the Air Force where theres so many different AFSCs where in the worst case scenario theres a chance you could be stuck doing security forces or maintainer work. Air Force also owns traditional IT jobs too, so you might get a helpdesk or networking role potentially, which you probably wouldn't want to do given you already have SOC analyst experience.\n\n\nUltimately theres pros and cons to both. I would say if you want to join something thats already extremely established with clear paths for progression the Air Force is for you. On the other hand, if you want to join something early on, be given alot of responsibility from earlier in your career to innovate and shape how things are done, and are okay with a greater degree of self autonomy, the Space Force is for you.\n\n\nEither way both are good options. Whichever branch you decide on, if youre qualified for sign-on bonuses due to your certifications make sure thats explicitly stated in your final contract before you sign it.\n\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any questions, I was prior Air Force before I transferred over to the Space Force so I have experience on both sides.",

TryHackMe and HackTheBox are good too. You can do this while studying for certs or even start with labs first, whatever clicks for you.\n\nIf you want a practical cert, CCDL1 is solid for entry-level blue team work.

Like an OSCP well underway, great conference CTF placements, etc.  \n  \nYour first step right now is qualifying for basic IT generalist roles right now and doing that for several years whilst working on appropriate cybersecurity training (formal education, home labs, or hackthebox, etc) and certs.

I would love for some advice on how to go about this. \n\nThe software dev position would start in January of this year, and given that the company likes me and I like them, I would stay with them till I graduate in December. Few things, it’s a smaller company, from what I’ve read it’s outdated and meh code. \n\nThe Information Security position is with a much larger company and would start in my (summer semester) and the internship would run from May - May. A couple tasks I would work on described to me are essentially doing access audits. So why does this person have access to this DB when they don’t ever use it, that type of stuff. \n\nSo, I was looking for some advice on what to do when it comes to this summer. Obviously, I’m going to take the software dev position from January to May, as I think that will look great on the resume. However, do I stay with the software dev or go into the Information Security position? Also, obviously if I HATE the software dev company I’m going to leave without a doubt, but in the most perfect of worlds with both to choose from what do you think. I have always wanted to go into cyber leaning roles and I feel this may be a great stepping stone into that position. I will also note, I have IT experience working for my university.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. ",

Dev work teaches you how systems break; security teaches you why they break quietly. Invest in that lens early.",

Though the majority of servers are using Unix/Linux, Windows still dominates the desktop market.\n\nAlthough you mentioned not wanting to go web heavy, I’d highly recommend using the OWASP Juice Shop https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/  as a learning tool.  It really is fantastic.\n\nHack the box, try hack me, and other sites have various learning paths.\n\nI highly recommend getting familiar with PowerShell, as it will make enumeration much easier once you are inside of a network.  \n\nDepending on what kind of pentesting you want to do, I’d also study up on social engineering, OSINT research methods, and ensure your people skills are on point…the weakest link in any system is most often the people.\n\nAnd lastly…don’t try to learn everything all at once.

          "text": "Be inquisitive. Don't expect you'll receive all the answers freely (also, how confident are you taking advice from strangers, when you're not even sure what you're doing?).\n\nBalance inquisitiveness with skepticism & critical thinking.\n\nBTW I love the fact you're actually getting your feet wet! I know people with almost all the CompTIA certs that have never even fired up linux (which is a bit problematic since the practical application is far more important in this side of cybersecurity).\n\n\\----\n\nHonestly, I really wish I gave priority to evidence gathering, proper documentation (Pen Test reports for different audiences. Sure, GenAI tools can make things somewhat easy, but DO NOT start relying on that too early. There are samples online, so you can understand how to structure it (and also how you can automate it) but never start learning something by learning shortcuts only) & journaling my learning progress either through recording/publishing videos or by writing blogs/posts on my own social media (such as Linkedin. github, medium) or on my own site. The journaling of learning progress is great for HR & execs. Learning how to write/communicate based on the audience is an invaluable skill (know what to talk about when you're talking with business execs & non-technicals), and how to communicate vulnerabilities/how the system was exploited to a team of technicals without turning it into a blame game.\n\nAs far as evidence gathering, I'm embarrassed to admit this but just so you don't have to suffer the same humiliation I'll share my experience. I used to use Cherry Tree to copy & paste my nmap, nikto & various other scans during my recon phase, & I stopped capturing everying properly. I didn't take proper notes about what worked & what didn't. This became quite evident when I got an interview for a position at a respected pen-testing company, that chose to use CTF challenges & documentation to assess candidates as opposed to interviews or focus on their resume/certs.\n\n\\---\n\nYoutube:\n\nEveryone has their own preference. This is mine: [https://www.youtube.com/@HackerSploit](https://www.youtube.com/@HackerSploit)\n\nI appreciate the well organized playlists, the patient explanations & the amount of information covered. I have plenty of others that I watch as well now, but when I was starting out, I really needed to understand what, why, how, etc. of what I'm actually doing as I followed along. Then again, to each their own.\n\nAs u/joshisold  mentioned, TryHackMe, HackTheBox are good sources. There is also Proving Grounds by OffSec (Play/Practice versions. They're the ones that are in charge of Kali Linux, which is one of the most popular Pen-Testing OS \\[but it is not the only one\\]). \n\nStart getting good at looking things up is a big one. It's not a personal dig, it's just too much information to retain at times that something might slip your mind. \n\nStart with basics (learn how to navigate using just the terminal and not a GUI) in Linux, & windows,. \n\n\\---\n\nOther than those, obviously, it helps to learn certain languages (depending on what you're pursuing): HTML/CSS, JS, SQL, Python, Powershell & Bash are good to learn imo (W3Schools.com is what I started with). \n\nVendors provide plenty of free/low cost learning resources Microsoft (https://learn.microsoft.com/), AWS SkillBuilder, Google's (you cna google it...it's mostly through Coursera if I remember right). IBM Has Skills Academy, Nvidia has their own thing, \n\n\\^ AI + Cloud\n\nPortSwigger has Web Security Academy to learn Burp Suite (very useful tool). \n\n\\---\n\nI'm going to stop there. \n\nTry to balance learning theory (WHY), with practical (HOW/WHAT) you're doing. I used to do 20/80 or 30/70 split in time towards theory & practical but your ratio may vary! \n\nI leave you with these parting words: \n\nLearning is a lifelong journey, not a a destination.",

There are a lot of things that can be a sign of people on your network that aren't supposed to be, but those can also be harmless. For the mobile thing, sometimes the phone operating system will uninstall apps that aren't frequently used, apple ios does, not sure about android os. This is the default setting you can turn it off. For the computer, the disappearance of files could mean that someone is there, or it could have been an accidental deletion while you or someone else was on your computer. \n\nIf you suspect anything wierd there are a few questions to ask yourself any time you see anything weird on your computer or mobile device. From easiest to check to hardest to check. \n\nIs my anti-virus software running or installed? \n\nWhen was the last scan of my devices for viruses? \n\nDo I need to make sure my virus definitions are up to date? \n\nIs there an unknown device on my network (i.e. You should be able to log into you router and see which devices are connected)?\n\nIs there traffic happening at odd hours (i.e. when everyone is sleeping or when everyone is at work/school. This will requre a tool like wireshark running and capturing traffic at the router for you to see traffic across the network)? \n\nDid I install something shady (i.e. software from a unknown source or untrusted author, cracked video games, free movies from those pirate sites)? \n\nDid I open a link or attachment in an email from an unknown sender? \n\nDid I click on a bad link from a website? \n\nIf you suspect something is malicious or just plain odd, change all your passwords and restore your system to a previous known good state. If the issues come back up, then you may need to restore to factory default.",

Not just the wifi but the router it self for different settings. If the router is provided by your internet company they will manage it so you will have to ask the internet company for any information from your router. You should ask for a list of connected devices. But easier than that is to buy a router that is approved by your internet company and use that instead of the provided one. If you buy it you can manage it yourself and log in to the router's admin page. Typically that will be http://192\\[.\\]168.1.1 or similar. Once there, look for sections like \"Connected Devices,\" \"DHCP Clients,\" or \"Wireless Clients\" to see a list of devices on your home network. ",

Many security experts advise people to not even open an unknown email message out of an abundance of caution. Meanwhile, the full payload of the malicious software is not necessarily contained within the email message. For example, an attachment or malicious hyperlink embedded in an email message often links to an external website managed by the bad actor. Clicking on the attachment or hyperlink then downloads or activates the malicious software from their web server. Because the malicious software is hosted on a server that email providers do not manage, and because threats are evolving and changing constantly, email providers cannot ensure protection from every potential threat.\n\nBecause the specific actions taken by the malware are not necessarily known, and because the threats are changing constantly, it is best to be equally cautious about unknown emails regardless of the device you are using.",

If Adobe Reader has some kind of \"0 day exploit\" that gives the attacker admin rights,. thats bad. \n\n* It's possible the Email contains an exploit that targets your Email software (Outlook, Thunderbird, etc). If there's some vulnerability say in \"How your Email client previews JPG images\".. then simply previewing the Email would be enough (but it would only effect a specific Email client. if the Vulnerability existed in Thunderbird but you were previewing the Email in macOS \"Mail\".. then that vulnerability doesn't effect you. \n\nThis is why people say to \"Not click unknown links\" or \"Don't open unknown attachments\"... because you can't predict what's on the other end of that \"unknown URL\".. and you also can't predict what's in that \"unknown Email\".

The occasional no click vulnerabilities that appear are rare, which means expensive. Unless you are a high value target, there would be no reason to risk blowing an exploit like this. With that being said, this advice only applies if you do not use AI, as things like prompt injection are a known issue. One other point that I haven’t seen being made, is the fact that a pixel can be added to the email, so when it is opened a url is hit and the email address is verified as being valid/active. This can lead to more spam/suspicious emails. If you really wanted to play around/have fun you could set up a dummy email and sandbox. Send any suspicious emails to the dummy email, and only open in a sandbox, and you greatly reduce any risk you may have had.",

      "text": "Hello! I think I need an advice about (potential) future career in cyber. I live in France, I am 29 years old. Before I lived in other country, where I studied informatics in university for two years, but in 2016 I dropped my studies and because of it didn't got a degree. My previous jobs haved a weak connection with an IT sector - in 2015-2016 I worked in non-commercial sector and in 2017-2022 I was a journalist, writing sometimes on technical topics and doing some OSINT research. In 2023 I got a desire to return in IT field, after this I spent a lot of time in studies, and in this month I've obtained an entry-level cert in networking - CCNA. Also since June of this year I've finished three pathways on THM - Cybersecurity 101, JR pentester and web fundamentals. I am planning soon to pass their PT1 exam. Also I am doing now medium-level machines on HTB a. As you can guess, I am more interested in pentesting side than in Blue teaming. My problem is that despite all my self-studies I feel myself totally disconnected from real cybersec and IT in general labor market. I have accounts in Linkedin and other jobboard sites and I spend numerous months in applying for different entry-level IT posts. It wasn't only cyber as an entry point, I tried to apply for different posts - also support and networking. But all the times result is the same - no reponse at all or negative reponses. I tried this year to begin to study in our local IT school in apprentisage, but I was obliged to find an enterpries to work at the same time with a studying and I didn't find it and because of it there wasn't a possibility to continue my studies there. Now I feel myself completely decouraged, mostly because I even't don't know the exact reason why I can't get even an entry-level job. I can't even imagine what I'm doing wrong, what is a key problem and what I must do to start work. The reason is a lack of experience, the lack of diplome or something other? Is there any sense for me to continue my self-studies if as a result I am samely infinitely far from a real job?  How I can I improve the situation? Maybe it's worth to apply to university, spend there 3 years and get a degree? Thank you in avance.",

      "text": "It is honestly so soul crushing when you put all this work into a rock solid pipeline and then some app layer exploit just bypasses everything the second it hits live traffic. You spend weeks fine tuning your scanners and making sure every single image is clean and every policy is enforced but then production starts acting up anyway and you are left scratching your head because the dashboard says everything is green. I am just so tired of the disconnect between our dev environments and the reality of what happens under actual load because these exploits are just so sneaky. Logs are basically useless in the beginning because they do not show anything is wrong until the damage is already starting to spread. It is incredibly frustrating to tell your boss that the pipeline said everything was fine but the live cluster is telling a completely different story. Has anyone here actually dealt with this kind of nightmare in a live environment or found a way to bridge that gap because it feels like our current tools are just missing the point entirely.",

      "text": "Hey,\n\nI just completed a full year with Optery using the ultimate package. I never had the time to do custom deletion requests but had the expanded reach feature active. I'd say the experience was ok, my main issue with them is that after a full year they couldn't remove my info from all websites they found initially.\n\nThis experience made me realize that while removing my PII from people search websites is important, I was still missing several things: private brokers, government records, data breaches, spam (physical and digital), phone calls, etc.\n\nThis year I want to try a different approach. I just canceled Optery, and got Cloaked. My plan is to slowly replace my identity from some websites, and hide my email and phone number as possible. So that's the proactive aspect.\n\nFor the reactive aspect of it, I'm considering Incogni (mostly because of private brokers vs Optery), and Privacy Bee (because of the extended features for vehicle, physical spam, etc.) on top of Cloaked.\n\nHas anyone tried an approach similar to this? It is difficult to assess these services practical value based on theoretical advantages of how they protect US consumers. Any insights between Incogni and privacy bee assuming Cloaked is there already?\n\nThanks!",
