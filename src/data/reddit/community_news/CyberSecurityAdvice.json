      "text": "I don't want to be a downer, but so many people on here are starting their undergrad in Cyber or asking if they should go Cyber for their undergrad, after graduating high school.\n\n* People with an undergrad degree in Cyber in 2018 - roughly 14,500\n* People with an undergrad degree in Cyber in 2026 - roughly 35,000\n\nThat's a more than 2.5x rise in degree Cybersecurity degree holders.  Do yourself a favor before choosing this major/degree, look up the # of people who have jobs in it after graduating.  You're now dealing with 2.5x the competition from Cyber degree holders alone.  This isn't counting all the laid of seasoned veterans.  10,000+ lay offs and counting.  \n\n* Global CompTIA Sec+ holders in 2019 - roughly 500,000\n* Global CompTIA Sec+ holders in 2026 - roughly 1,000,000\n\nIs it fair?  No.  Is it the reality?  Yes.  Here's what you're up against.  Doubling of degree holders in cyber and Sec+ holders.  Roughly 204,000 laid of tech workers in major companies and FAANG - Source [https://www.trueup.io/layoffs](https://www.trueup.io/layoffs) \\- IG/Tiktok course seller graduates.  AI and a 75% surge in offshoring/outsourcing to India jobs that used to be entry level Cyber jobs for Americans.  Think Associate/Jr Cyber Analysts, SOC Analysts, Associate Cyber Engineers.  Please stop making these Vendors of courses rich.  Stop making these universities rich.  Stop making these bootcamps rich...  they're the ones making all the money.  While a lot of people in the 204,000 private sector (not even counting gov contracting/gov layoffs) are laid off seasoned Cyber vets.  That is your competition.\n\n  \nCyber is no longer the \"high job security.  high pay quick\" job field.  Exception - You're at a Senior or Principle level with a lot of experience.  Stop throwing away your money.",

          "text": "For anyone trying to get into cyber security and gets discouraged by this post don’t. \n\nCybersecurity is not an entry level role to begin with. Most people transition from networking or from help desk roles.\n\nAlso cybersecurity degree is not throwing away your money. Only case that I would say it’s throwing away money is if you have to 100% pay out of pocket for the degree and put yourself into big student loan debt. Truth is a bachelor degree is just something the jobs use to filter out applications. So they honestly don’t care where you got the degree from as long as it’s a valid one. So pick the cheapest one where you’ll have the least amount of debt.\n\nA big tip for folks that graduated. I know a full time position is what you want but also consider contract positions for those help desk roles. A six month contract is still 6 months of experience to get you hired for a full time roll. Can be an easier to land that position. There are also recruiters that you can find and contact in most bigger cities that can help.\n\nAlso, social media likes to make it seem like it’s something easy to do and that anybody can get it easily. Truth is you are going to spend hours and hours learning new things. Hours and hours studying for certifications. And once you think you know a lot you find out you don’t so you have to learn more. It’s continual learning and progressing. \n\nIf it was easy everybody would do it. Don’t be quick to give up. The world rewards those who don’t take no for an answer, who are determined to get what they want no matter how hard and those who are willing to put in the work. That’s not just with cyber security but with anything worth while in life. \n\nIf anybody has questions feel free to ask.",

Do you like to deal with people? Do you prefer to sit infront of a computer investigating logs? Do you like coding? Do you like selling solutions? Do you prefer to do policies like GRC?   \n5) What career goal do you wish to work towards in the future (5-10 years)? Do you want to be a CISO? Do you want to be a Security Engineer/Architect? Do you want to be a researcher? Do you want to be a penetration tester? Do you want to be in Threat Intelligence? Do you want to be a manager for an operations team?  \n6) Where are you located? Is there a mature cybersecurity need within your state/country? Do you intend to move?\n\nSounds like you're most motivated with monetary value which is great - that's sort of where I got started. But without a clear goal for yourself, without doing proper homework, without considering your own strengths and wants, it's easy for you to get lost in Cybersecurity just because it's such a huge and diverse field. \n\nIt ranges from SOC analysts jobs to being a cybersecurity vendor where you're mostly sales and business but you still need cybersecurity knowledge. But both jobs are vastly different for the skillsets they require. \n\nEvery city has different pay grades as well. Even for a SOC analyst role can vary from MSSP types to lucrative 6 figure jobs following an around-the-sun model in an MNC. \n\nHaving a goal helps with the passion, and your suffering to get to that goal will have meaning. \n\nSo figure out that goal first.   \n  \nI have friends in cybersecurity who earn around USD$40k a year, while I could earn USD$80k in the same job title in different environments. Different industries pay different, different companies pay different. \n\nHope this insight helps. ",

You can definitely get certs and then go apply for entry level help desk roles. After spending some time in a help desk role (maybe 6 months - 1 or 2 years) it will be easier for you to get a cybersecurity job as you will have experience supporting industry standard software and systems.\n\nCertifications from CompTIA give you a broad view of the field and help you build foundational knowledge. After you get Network+ or Security+ I would suggest trying to get some Microsoft Azure certs since most companies use it or it’s sister softwares in some form. \n\n\nTo answer your original question, I make around 85,000 in Louisiana. I have been in IT since 2021 and worked my way up to a security only role in an MSP.\n\nIf you are going to college specifically for Cybersecurity, I want to advise you that most places would rather you have four years of experience working in the IT workforce then a bachelors degree in Cybersecurity. Don’t feel like you must go to college to get a career in cybersecurity. Certifications and experience reign supreme in this field.",

AI can surface signals, but it doesn’t understand business context.\n\nThe bigger shift is the attack surface. LLMs wired into internal systems, agents with API access, AI in pipelines , that’s a lot of new failure modes to threat model.\n\nSo yeah, while basic AI literacy is probably becoming normal, you don't need to learn to build models, but ignoring how these systems can be abused is going to be a blind spot.\n\n",

When joiner/leaver automation, conditional access, and Windows login MFA are aligned, support tickets drop significantly.\n\nThe biggest problems usually don’t come from MFA itself. They come from legacy auth still hanging around in the environment.",

When you purchase your DOCSIS modem id advise you to spend the money (roughly $400) and install an enterprise grade router which will allow you to segment your network, (separate IoT devices from sensitive personal devices). Enterprise routers also can have IDS/IPS already installed which will give you a much higher degree of control over what traffic is allowed in or out of your network.  Good luck.",

I wouldn’t call myself a complete beginner, but I’m somewhere between beginner and beginner–intermediate.\n\nI’m thinking about starting CTFs, but I’m unsure if I’m at the right stage yet.\n\n* Will CTFs be too hard for me right now?\n* Should I first focus on learning web exploitation properly and then start doing CTFs?\n* Or can a beginner jump into CTFs and learn along the way?\n\nI’d really appreciate any advice from people who’ve been in a similar position. How did you approach CTFs when you were starting out?\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "I have a business website(wordpress) and in the last two days, I have received 2000 hits from 1 IP address. I have checked multple sources and it is one owned by a \"regional\"/very local ISP.\n\nI also have HubSpot Buyer Intent enabled on the website. Interestingly enough a business shows up for these entries. More specifically an IT/CyberSecurity Business.\n\nWhen I google the business, it has 1 employee, and that business lies right smack dab in the middle of the geographic area of the ISP's coverage. The business is a little difficult to find, but has a YouTube channel, where said person identifies themselves.\n\nFrom my end I have blocked and unblocked the IP range on the CDN and Website side, when I unblock the hits persist.\n\nWhere my head is at is I am a bit annoyed, it took a few hours to figure this out and seems a bit amateurish in nature. I don't know this person from Adam other then they are in the IT industry and if they are doing this to my business, how many other businesses are they doing this to?\n\nAm I within my right to file an IC3 and present the facts as they are?",

Its not intrusive or a pentest so to speak more like driving by your house and looking at what you have visible from the front yard.\n\nI'm not saying this is whats going on here, but that is something that could be going on.
