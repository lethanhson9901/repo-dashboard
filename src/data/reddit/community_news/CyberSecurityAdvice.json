Most of my coworkers and friends in IT did not go to college or still needed an internship or entry level job to get into IT.\n\nCollege teaches you a lot of technical stuff, but it really doesn't show the real-world aspect. Our teammates that didn't work in HelpDesk or another IT field before getting to Security Analyst struggle to know what a legitimate issue is and what'sa false positive; and they often rely on our Sysadmin team to explain it and explain why it's not a risk.\n\nPersonally, I think telling everyone they need college is BS, but I get that there are IT jobs out there that need it, such as developers, cybersecurity, etc. But they also still need the real world experience.\n\nIt's the same for someone getting a business degree and expecting to just immediately be hired as a manager with no experience. While it's possible and it does happen, not as often and it shouldn't. Managers with no experience are some of the worst, most out of touch managers. CIO's with no IT experience are terrible at their job. It is a different skillset than a sysadmin, but the experience makes a big difference.",

Like just about every IT specialty at one point it was a small enough domain that it wasn't a specialty. If the sum of the security field is logging onto a unix box and configuring a firewall, then unix admins just configure the firewall. \n\nAs the domain got more and more advanced the required skills got wider and wider. At a non-exact point it became difficult to possess both the skillset needed to be an expert in cyber security and another domain. \n\nPeople don't get into specialties, they become someone who works in specialties as they learn and specialize. \n\nIt's similar to executives, very few people start off as executives. They gain knowledge in a domain that leads to gaining skills relevant to executives, Eventually their skillset matches to expectations and they move across the line to a title more aligned with \"Executive.\"",

This is where security becomes real.\n* Certs to promote later: CySA+, SSCP, cloud security specialty (not all at once).\n\nPeople get stuck because they wait until graduation to “start cybersecurity”.

There's different places to start. \n\nLet me tell you something that will help you out, and let you know the road is not impossible although it may be long and hard to take the first step: \nThe amount of idiots who \"worked their way up\" to cybersecurity and lack any actual critical thinking or cybersecurity knowledge is ridiculous. It might not be the majority, but I have met way too many that it makes me worried for the future of the field. I have met way too many who knows how something works, and can configure security configurations. But actually working with budgets? Writing comprehensive risk and vulnerability assessments? Communicating complex technical terms to non-technical people? Investigating data breaches or security incidents? Way too many of them fall short. They will literally parrot terms without knowing how they actually apply and go through the motions, but that's it. If brain dead mouth breathers can do it, anyone can. \n\nBut, if you want to be great, here is my advice: Don't just know what you are doing, know WHY you are doing it. Knowing how something works is important, yes, but taking it that step further will help you in the long run. Also, personal projects. They help you learn and can look good on resumes. Always ask questions if you have them. Network, network, network. And I mean people. Reach out to people in the industry for knowledge and advice. And (super important) DEVELOP PEOPLE SKILLS. If you are still in school or just starting out, these are things you can do.",

If I were you, I’d do two things:\n\n* Get comfortable with the boring fundamentals (networking, Windows/Linux, DNS, how logins/auth actually work).\n* Get *any* real experience early (campus IT job, part-time help desk, internship, even helping a small org set stuff up). That “I’ve touched real systems” thing matters way more than people think.\n\nAlso: projects beat vibes. Build a tiny home lab, break it a little, then fix it. Even something simple like “I set up Windows + Linux, turned on logging, and learned how to spot weird logins” is already more convincing than “I want to work in cybersecurity.”\n\nEntry-level security roles do exist, they’re just usually called stuff like SOC analyst L1 / security analyst intern / GRC intern — and they’ll expect you to not panic when someone says “DNS” or “AD.”\n\nWhat are you studying? CS? IT? And do you want the “blue team” side (defense, detection) or more like hacking/appsec?",

          "text": "So I'm of the, apparently, minority mindset that there are entry-level roles in cybersecurity. It's just incredibly competitive right now and generally businesses prefer to hire people with experience rather than invest time and resources in training for new grads.\n\nSOC analyst positions and some security analyst positions (depends on the tasks identified in the job description, specifically I'm thinking about monitoring focused roles) are safe bets for entry level roles, but again, they're competitive. \n\nWhile you're in school, start a homelab and document your projects. This can even start with an online service like hack the box, but a mini-PC that you can break and build larger projects on is ideal. Documentation can be a blog, Youtube videos, or just GitHub. This is also a great way to explore some of the different security domains to get a better understanding of what you want to specialize in (Infrastructure, Networking, Secure coding, Pentesting, GRC, etc.)\n\nAlso while you're in school, internships will be incredibly valuable on your resume after graduation. So your grades matter (to be competitive for internships) and apply to anything you can find as early as you can. This is another way to explore the various security domains that you might be interested in. \n\nWhen it comes time to send out job applications, absolutely send applications to SOC analyst and Security analyst roles. But if you don't have much success after a few months, broaden your search to Help Desk roles and anything IT related. Any IT role counts as IT work experience, and after 6-12 months you'll be in a better position to try sending out applications again. I say 6-12 months to start sending out applications again, but honestly it may take 2-3 years of progressive experience before you actually land a security role. It really depends on the job market and your resume as a whole.\n\nDon't get discouraged if this is something you're passionate about. It's not impossible to break into security, but it can take some time and perseverance.",

I’m currently in college for a bachelors in cybersecurity but everyone on Reddit just complains about how hard it is to break into cyber and you need 3-7 years of experience in tech and blah blah blah. So now I’m doubting my degree a little. I still want a degree but I’m worried about my future yk? So I’m wondering does getting a masters make a huge difference for job prospects or not really? Would it be worth my time to get a master?\n\nEdit/update: thank you everyone for the response. Common consensus seems to be I don’t need a masters and should focus on experience. Which I’m trying. I have my A+, about to test for my net+, and then on to sec+,ccna, and maybe some other small certs as I keep looking for any entry tech job. I might get a masters later on but that would be deep into my career perhaps. Any other thoughts please feel free to comment",

I do occasionally hire college graduates, though I’m not hiring right now.\n\nIf you put yourself in my position and you have one opening to fill, that person has to walk in ready to work on day one. They’re joining an overworked team and need to contribute quickly.\n\nNow imagine a candidate who says:  \n“I’m online with WGU. I’m not doing much outside of school. I’ve thought about building a homelab and maybe trying to job shadow. I have a job, but it’s not in tech. There aren’t many local options, even entry-level. I’m not really involved with the school since it’s online.”\n\nWould you hire that person?\n\nThat candidate wouldn’t be competing against one or two people. They’d be competing against dozens, sometimes hundreds, of applicants. Many of them already have hands-on IT experience, internships, student jobs, help desk work, or lab work they can clearly explain and defend in an interview.\n\nSo what can you do to improve your chances of getting noticed?\n\nThere is no place in this country that doesn’t have some kind of IT or tech work happening. Small businesses, local governments, hospitals, schools, manufacturers, even farms need IT support. You have to go find those opportunities.\n\nThis is one of the biggest weaknesses of fully online programs. They don’t naturally provide the resources, exposure, and networking that in-person universities do. That doesn’t mean it’s hopeless, but it does mean the burden is on you to work harder to stand out.\n\n“Thinking about doing a homelab” isn’t enough. You need real-world, in-person experience. You need to show that you can show up on time, work with other people face-to-face, take direction, accept criticism, and function in real operational environments. That’s what hiring managers are looking for, especially when the team is already stretched thin.",

          "text": "Ok, there are some common complaints about degrees that are understandable but largely come down to misunderstandings, in my opinion. Particularly in IT, a degree is not needed in order to break in. And often, in the first few years, someone who skipped college and went straight into IT will earn more than someone who went the degree route first. But this compensation gaps tends to flip after a few years for a couple reasons that I don't think get talked about much.\n\nWhile you don't need a degree to break into IT, a degree definitely cuts down on the experience requirement when you apply for roles (not in the first couple years, but once you're established it definitely makes a difference). This is less pronounced for purely technical roles, but as you progress your career and consider promotion opportunities you'll really start to notice it.\n\nSo this really breaks down into 2 different considerations: 1) Are you comfortable continuing school? 2) Do you know for sure that want to focus on security policy/compliance and/or want to work your way towards CISO type leadership roles?\n\n1) School isn't for everyone. The system is just not ideal for certain personality types. But don't jump to conclusions just because school is annoying. Are you able to focus in classrooms, get your homework done, and write term papers? Are consistently passing your classes without much difficulty? If the answers are yes, then you should probably go down the college route. But if you do have trouble staying focused in a classroom or completing your coursework, then you may want to consider going directly into IT.\n\n2) Question 2 is specifically to figure out if you should pursue a Masters degree right away. In most cases, a Masters degree will not give you a significant leg up when breaking into IT or IT Security. But down the line, if you are considering management or executive positions, a Masters degree will become a requirement. If you know now (or before you complete your Bachelors) that you really want to focus on GRC, compliance auditing, or policy writing, then in those cases a Masters can also be beneficial.\n\nIn most cases I would say don't sign up for a Master program right from highschool, unless it condenses a both a Bachelors and Masters degree into a shortened timeframe. You can always sign up for a Masters program while finishing a Bachelors degree or go back to school mid career for a Masters, but a lot of people start to feel burnout by the end of their Bachelors program.  \n  \nThere's also the financial piece to consider, but I'm of the opinion that either type of degree in a STEM field will pay for itself down the line.",

Upon graduation I went off to go do my student co-op as a solutions architect from which my program was secure software engineering.\n\nI was hired on a short term contract that lead to full time employment as a security architect - yes I’m well aware that this went far beyond against the grain and while some would say that I am lucky I ask myself all the time… was I though? When contracted I was asked to fix the organizations 4 year failed threat modelling process because I had vast knowledge for AppSec, DevSecOps and SSDLC as a result of my program. I did that, I turned around the culture and educated them and wrote literally a field manual for how to do threat modelling efficiently and effectively. I did this while apart of the security architecture team as a solutions architect and one senior sec arch was blown away and asked where the heck did I learn this stuff because he’s never seen anything like it. This is what led me to immediately be hired full time as one of them.\n\nNow comes the problems I faced. I knew software, I knew the methodologies, I knew the frameworks, I knew the tools, I knew how to code with security as the forefront. I however did not know networks, and I did not know the systems and how all those things come together. This aspect that I did not know is what is most important in cybersecurity. Now I told my director that they can find better talent than what I had to offer when they offered me full time - it did not feel good to me but my director reaffirmed that I would learn these things with time but my value was more so the development side of the house because not 1 member of the team knew it like I knew it and this is what they wanted. So I accepted.\n\nFor easily 1 year after being hired I suffered extreme anxiety, and extreme imposter syndrome and it took a long time to feel like I belonged amongst these seniors in the space. I always felt stupid and always felt I needed to leave. I couldn’t speak on the technical level the others of my team spoke on and I struggled to even sit and listen during conversations because I could not keep up.\n\nIt was terrible but my director was always ready to keep me grounded and calm my nerves.\n\nNow while my team and my director were as patient as they were and that I so desperately needed, I fathom it would be difficult for others finding themselves in a similar position would too have a team ready to support a very jr member of the team that the jr requires in order to succeed with time. Especially that by all accounts, I should never have been hired as a security architect, it was by far too senior of a role for a fresh graduate. I still cannot comprehend why take the chance on me from the directors pov.\n\nSo it is possible to expedite one’s way into cybersecurity but it will yield consequences and in my case it was my mental health for the longest time.",

If you are able to work in a medium-big company you can steadly grown there, like it was for me, but also a small business will allow you to grow in a different way, like you will mostly have a lot of experience in many areas, you will have to be technical support, sysadmin, Network guy, the \"security guy\" and etc, but it comes with a lot of experience in many areas.\n\nIn the end, try to start somewhere, once you are working, it will be easier to find for best positions as you grow.",

If you have the money take the exam.  Still you can skip the exams and study for the CCNA.  That will cover all the Network basics.  Then maybe study.  \n\nLook at the local CC as well.  You could possibly dual credit some courses.  Finally go to partners.wgu.edu.  Go to partners.wgu.edu.  Click your state and see if the school is listed.  If it is see what degree you can get that transfers into the WGU degree.  CCNA gives you 11 credits towards the Cybersecurity and the BSIT.  Personally I would recommend the BSIT as you can transfer in more.  As you get the higher Comptia certs you can get your MSCIA at WGU.",

You think you do because you have no clue what cybersecurity really is, but you hear it's cool like the movies, you get to play with advanced gadgets, and it pays a ton of money.\n\nThe reality is, the pay sucks for 80% of people compared to other specialties, you're basically blindly reading through log files / text files all day, or running mundane pointless reports and audits.   \n\nCyberSecurity requires 5-10 years minimum experience in a ton of different IT areas to be truly good and excel, and colleges are handing out degrees like popcorn.\n\nSo if you try to pursue cyber instead of a regular more balanced IT degree, you're going to struggle to find a job for months at a time.  Once you do get a job you're going to be miserable and hate it, and you're going to be making $20 an hour for the first few years with small pay raises and a low chance of moving up and advancing your career.  \n\nStick with general IT or CS.  Learn Linux, learn AD, networking, understand in general how databases work, and go into IT with an open mind.   Think of it like getting icecream.  If you've never had any flavor ice cream before, why would you fixate on only trying vanilla, when there's 80 different flavors you should give a chance to?",

As there is nothing here that helps me confirm whether or not you're infected.\n\nA rootkit from a torrent would be interesting; piracy would usually carry the risk of either a RAT or an infostealer (it's almost always Lumma). The filename there is making me think it's ConnectWise ScreenConnect, which is an RMM tool that some threat actors use as a RAT. But that's not the normal installation directory that I've seen in the wild, which makes me suspicious.\n\nI'd do this in powershell, but that's just because I'm used to working from a terminal. Don't have my triage scripts to hand, so this will seem a little janky.\n\nGo into powershell, and do \"gci \"C:/Program Files (x86)/Windows Service/\" -Force -Rec\"; that will show you everything under that Windows Service directory and all its subdirectories. Let me know what is in there, it'll help me smell if anything is weird about it.\n\nDownload autoruns from sysinternals; look through all the tabs, do you notice anything that smells weird? Even a rootkit has to autoload at some point, they generally aren't that sneaky to hide from an autoruns check (especially the kind of rootkits you'd encounter through piracy)",

ONLY download what you need, for example the english subtitle and MKV file in my case. if u let ur torrent software load u can uncheck all unwanted files.\n\nAlways check what you torrent if you are going to torrent.

              "text": "When it comes to jobs in cyber, the market today isn’t what it was three or four years ago. Things have matured and consolidated, especially in the U.S. and other western countries. Expectations are higher now, and experience actually matters again. Most people aren’t walking straight out of college into a pure “cyber” role anymore. Some do, but they’re the exception, not the rule. To really succeed in cyber, you need a solid technical foundation first.\n\nIf you’ve never worked with networks or really understand how systems talk to each other, how are you going to make sense of alerts in a SOC? Are employers supposed to teach you all of that on the job? They usually won’t, because there are hundreds of applicants who already have that experience and can contribute on day one.\n\nSame thing with DFIR. If you don’t understand how Windows and Linux log activity, how data is stored, how the registry works, what event logs are telling you, or how systems behave in memory, it’s going to be really hard to step into that role and be effective. That knowledge doesn’t come from theory alone.\n\nThe reality is that most tech jobs have some cybersecurity built into them. Help desk, system admin, and network admin roles are where a lot of people actually learn “cyber” without the title. That’s where you deal with accounts, permissions, Active Directory, Linux file access, locking down servers, rebuilding old or vulnerable systems, and cleaning up real-world messes. That’s the foundation.\n\nAnd that foundation is what lets you move into cybersecurity later and actually be good at it. So when you’re job hunting, don’t narrow your search too much. Cast a wide net. A lot of solid cyber careers start in roles that don’t have “cybersecurity” in the title at all.",

You didn’t explicitly say that, but I want to clarify why it would be wrong to say so.\n\nCybersecurity is, at its core, applied computer science. To be effective in \"serious\" roles, like Exploit Development, Reverse Engineering, Cryptography, or Cloud Architecture, you need to understand memory management, kernel structures, discrete math, and networking protocols at a low level. A degree forces you to learn those fundamentals, and by professionals; certifications often just teach you how to use a tool.\nFurthermore, an engineering degree acts as a trusted proxy for problem-solving ability and grit. It tells a hiring manager that you can handle complex, abstract tasks. Sure, you can get an entry-level SOC job without a degree, but good luck getting past the HR filters for a Principal Security Engineer role with just a GitHub repo and a bootcamp certificate.",

Basic math is usually enough, like understanding percentages, logs at a very surface level, or reading numbers in reports.\n\nA lot of the work is more about problem solving, logic, reading logs, understanding how systems and networks work, and following processes. Stuff like threat analysis, incident response, SOC work, GRC, blue team, etc barely uses “school math” at all.\n\nThat said, you still need to be okay with technical concepts and learning new tools. Some areas like cryptography or data science side of security can get mathy, but those are specific niches, not the whole field. Many people in cyber were bad at math in school and still do fine. If you’re okay with computers, troubleshooting, and learning step by step, it’s still a realistic option.",

Ideally, link a virtual card (PayPal Key if available, or a bank-issued virtual debit card) to your PayPal wallet and pay only through the official PayPal checkout. Merchants see only a PayPal token, not your card details, and you’re covered by PayPal’s fraud protection, at least for what they say. Enable 2FA, use biometric phone lock, and avoid entering card details directly on merchant sites to minimize risk.",

      "text": "So, I have to make this final year project for the last year of my cyber security degree, at first I was very motivated to make something new something unique for my FYP and decided to make an AI based NIDS system, that will comprise of 4 AI algorithms, 2 supervised, decision tree and random forest, and 2 unsupervised, isolation forest and autoencoders.\nFor the first part of the FYP I had to make the supervised part for which I took NIDS dataset from university of queens website and trained the models on the 2 algorithms.\nNow me having no idea or knowledge about AI somehow managed to make the thing an make it look like it was working which it is to some extent, it is basically 2 pkl files which predict the whether the packet is an attack packet or benign.\nWhich I think was not the right way to it, and could have been done in a way that the model still keeps on learning on the new packets it was receiving after it was trained on the initial dataset.\nNow I have to work on the unsupervised part of the project and the whole IDS, and again I know I will have to watch 100s and 100s of tutorial read 100s of theories on it and somehow I will manage to make it work in the end but I don't really want to do it like that again because it was such a hassle.\nSo I wanted to know if there is like a similar open source project, similar to the one described above, which I can tweak and reshape into what I have to present, or if there is any tutorial(s) that I can watch and work along to make the project.\nOr any other help or suggestion anyone can give me on how I should make this project would be very helpful and appreciate.",

      "text": "Hello!  \nI recently booted up my laptop and was alerted that Windows Local Security Authority had stopped a ScreenConnect file from loading. It was located in C:/Program Files (x86)/Windows Service/. As far as I know, “Windows Service” is not a default Windows folder, and if I had downloaded ScreenConnect, I would have had no reason to place it there or name it that way.\n\nThe download date was from June. I haven’t had any security issues since then, so I assume this was the first time it tried to run during a restart.\n\nI didn’t have much of importance on my laptop—only a few files I wanted to keep and might revisit. I reset the laptop and reinstalled Windows 11 using a cloud install. But is that enough? I’ve read that rootkits like this can reinstall themselves even after a Windows reinstall.\n\nI’m a total novice when it comes to cybersecurity, and I’ve been extremely anxious about this over the past couple of days. I’ve been checking my laptop after every restart, and no ScreenConnect/ConnectWise files have appeared again, but I just want to be extra sure. Otherwise, I’ll be agonizing over this until I eventually replace the laptop.\n\nI also uninstalled my Remote Desktop Connection app. I know that’s probably unrelated—it was mostly for peace of mind.\n\nEdit: I also updated my BIOS/UEFI\n\nThank you! Any advice here would be massively appreciated",

          "text": "It depends on how badly you want to keep the device, if you really wanna keep the laptop, what you should do is completely reformat the drive by doing something like installing Linux to override your windows, then reinstalling windows afterwards. However you could be around 80% confident that it'll remove the virus because reformating the drive will delete even the windows kernal and everything. Otherwise, if you are ok with it, the only way to fully know that the root kit is gone is by destroying the device entirely. If the malware infects on the hardware or BIOS level, destruction is the only option as the malware will persist through OS installs. However, if it's kernal level or below like most malware is, then reinstallation after reformating will work. \n\nAlthough these are the nuclear option, if you want a way that may work without reinstalling windows, Id say take a look at the Tron script, it's comprehensive enough to remove most malware from my experience",

      "text": "Landed my first job at a contractor for systems security engineering. I asked at the interview obviously but they gave me a very vague answer since it is dependent on the projects I am involved with so they gave the higher level explanation that I will be involved with designing or maintaining in these projects. I just want to know if anyone has a dumbed down version of what I could expect from this role in their experience in a general day to day. At the interview they mostly cared about my experience with federal GRC, STIGs, Rational doors and I will be assigned to different projects. So I assume I will be a documentation person but I also am not sure what that looks like day to day-is it a lot of meetings and assessing security controls? I am relatively knowledgeable about those areas but my projects in my internships were very specific on what to do for a particular scenario.",
