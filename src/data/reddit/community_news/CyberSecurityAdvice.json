Whilst there are good programs out there, most are pretty lacklustre. The real thing you should be doing is looking at summer placements and internships with companies you'd be interested in working for; that will help you stand out.\n\nA degree without those placements will mean you'd be competing with people that may have a few years in a related role looking to get into SOC, dev work, etc. Which will count against you.\n\nEdit: also, the skills are pretty transferable if you're looking at the engineering and automation side. There is a certain truth to the idea that the market is saturated for both CompSci and Cyber, but it's also a little overblown. If you're trying to get in with absolutely no experience, of course it's going to be hard. And a lot of the oversaturation is the people that did a stupid bootcamp over covid working their way through the system and being found incompetent.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nIm currently helping a new friend of mine who has been dealing with a serious stalking/hacking situation for years now. I cant go into detail because I dont want the person seeing this and knowing whats up. \n\nI will just say that the person in question has a high level of skill and has been making my friends life a nightmare. From what I have seen and heard from my friend, I'm guessing its RATs & SIM swaps and/or persistent session tokens, as he is able to access, edit and delete files off her devices and also knows private things like her schedule and things she has said to other people via text etc, just to name a few things. My friend is not tech savvy at all so is really stuck and distressed by all this.\n\nI have checked her Windows 11 PC and she is definitely being compromised there. Again I dont wanna disclose exactly what, but it is quite advanced.\n\nI am not an expert in in cyber security, so I was hoping to get some input/critique from some of you more knowledgeable redditors :) \n\n**This is my current plan:**\n\n1. Completely wiping Windows. I’ve already created a bootable USB for Fedora Silverblue due to its immutable features.\n2. I was thinking of using a Fedora Live session to pull only her essential files (photos/docs) onto an external drive, specifically avoiding AppData, Program Files, and any .exe or .js files\n3. I have purchased a new modem for her, it is a TP Link Archer AX55, I chose it because of the Homeshield feature.\n4. I'll be doing all the obvious stuff, like fresh emails for all accounts, adding a password manager, locking down her home network including her security cameras, contacting her phone carrier to add a port out pin, education etc.\n\n**My Questions for the Community:**\n\n* Is Fedora Silverblue the right choice for someone who needs \"set and forget\" security? She really only uses the internet for shopping and browsing so she's not fussy and Fedora seems to have a user friendly interface.\n* Are there specific \"hardened\" settings in Fedora I should toggle?\n* She uses an iPhone and I'm shit with Apple products, so I'm not certain on what to do here other than change her Apple ID and doing an Emergency Reset i believe it's called. Is there anything I can add to her iPhone to harden it?\n* Do you think going back to using gmail/google is a shit idea? Or OK if everything else is tight? Otherwise Im guessing Protonmail is best?\n* Also just to note, she doesn't want to buy a Mac or change her phone to something else, as I did already suggest Graphene.\n\nI just want to make sure I’m giving her a fortress that she can actually use without being a tech expert. Any advice or feedback would be greatly appreciated! Please keep in mind I am not an expert in any way, so please be nice if I have said anything dumb! :) \n\nThank you everyone\n\n",

There's really no reason to completely change OSes. \n\n* Keep all your stuff updated (OS updates, App updates, Browser updates, .. basically anything App or Browser or thing you use on a daily basis, .you should be keeping updated on a daily basis)\n\n* Don't click or run unknown shit. All your app installs etc should come from original official sources. Don't open unknown emails. Don't install unknown Apps. Don't respond to unknown SMS, etc etc. \n\n* Use a Password manager and make sure all your online accounts have good, long, strong, unique passwords along with MFA or Authenticator of some kind (or Yubikey or other hardware auth) \n\n> \"someone who needs \"set and forget\" security? \"\n\nThere's no such thing as \"set it and forget it\" security. Anytime a person is using a device (smartphone, computer, etc),.. good security practices should be first and foremost in the front of their mind. \"What am I clicking on ?\".. \"Why is the computer asking me to do something?\".. \"Was that behavior or outcome I just witnessed normal and expected?\" .. All of those types of questions need to be running through someone's mind while using a computer. (Computer and Device use needs to be a \"engaged activity\".) You can't just mindlessly or blindly use it and think \"it's going to protect me from anything unknown\".. because that's not how it works. \n\n> \"I will just say that the person in question has a high level of skill \"\n\nThis is largely irrelevant. Unless the person is like a 40year NSA employee or something,. the idea that they can easily or effortlessly \"hack someone's computer\" is not feasible or realistic. If you wipe a device and install clean version of Win11 or macOS or iOS,.. you're pretty well protected. Someone cannot just \"wave a magic Harry Potter wand\" and instantly or easily hack into your devices. Doesn't work like that.",

BYOD. Contractors. Random legacy tools that assume flat network access. The stuff vendors do not put in the demo.\n\nDid policy management stay sane over time?\n\nDid device posture checks become constant exception handling?\n\nDid users feel a real improvement or just a different kind of friction?\n\nAnd be honest.

          "text": "I do cyber consulting, but this is not a sales pitch. I am in various phases of POC/selection/implementation/refinement with a number of clients, including those whose cyber programs we manage.\n\nPros:\n\n* Way faster connectivity for remote users to on-prem service access based on the product we/they chose in a couple clients. An executive was across an ocean and had faster connectivity than he used to have at his house in the US. File shares, ERP, databases, everything is faster.  User experience is generally positive, even with the hiccups.\n* Much more fine grained access to resources. One example: RDP was required for a subset of users due to some niche compute requirements. Now that is much more controlled.\n* We are 4 (?) months into one I'll reference. VPN is still available for the IT team, but all users in all sub-companies are migrated to the platform. There were hiccups, but was surprisingly smooth. Most hiccups were related to \"Oh I didn't know so-and-so used resource XYZ and we just blocked their access to it\". \n* Amazing shadow IT detection. You'd be surprised what people use their work computers/accounts for if you have never been able to filter or sanction specific applications.\n* We didn't buy a static IP. Instead, we created an Azure compute instance as a connected tunnel and route all URLs requiring static IP for origin to that. It works well, but only do that if you are willing to add that slight overhead, as it would be much easier to just have it in the platform. We only needed that because some SaaS subscriptions require it for org access.\n\nCons: \n\n* Management absolutely requires more effort. If your implementation partner (if there is one) isn't handing over documentation on WHY they implemented a certain way and where you should go/make changes in the future efficiently, it will eventually turn into spaghetti (like most tools though). This wasn't a deal breaker (obv), but is a consideration for a small team like you said.\n* Captive portal detection: it might be limited to one product or configuration (as you said, complex product that continually needs refinement) but for the life of me some airlines just will not let the agent detect it is captive with some vendors. It results in a \"travel\" AD/Entra group and some device setting rules that allow people to turn off the agent when they are traveling. Not ideal, but working through it. Probably platform specific, but I promise it's not an obvious dumb config mistake (\"oh just turn on that widget!\").\n* We have a pain point managing local breakout/device profiles on some platforms. Admin interface is a compromise between features and overhead to manage it. \n* The right vendor absolutely depends on a couple factors, and it is easy to choose the wrong one. If you have server initiated traffic (Microsoft SCCM, some RMMs, etc) that is a limitation in the space. Others are AMAZING and present this super-duper-awesome DLP capability, but remember that additional capability usually means additional management overhead. If you don't tag data today?\n\nIn closing: users, execs, and IT personnel like it compared to the VPN. We would do it again (and continue to recommend) for most use cases. Spend the time on a POC/POV with all the features you are looking to license to validate your use cases. Where I see most difficulty is not the tool limitations (although that still is there) but in your implementation/architecture choice. Sales people are used to matching need key words -> SKUs. They are NOT good at knowing you are looking for the \"good enough\" version of what you are trying to do. ",

Otherwise it would have been apparent for ALL users over the last few months.\n\nIn the SMB space where you have much more simple environments, or you can change subnets easily, you may have less problems. Some of my clients are growing through acquisition so while the initial integration is easy, the refinement over time is still a challenge, like if there are overlapping subnets for private resources between companies. But that is also just a challenge of integrating two companies together.",

AI has a lot of unsolved (and maybe unsolvable) problems in the realm of security, as things like prompt injection don't seem likely to go away anytime soon.\n\nHowever, it's all relative to what CEOs and corporations decide to prioritize. Cybersecurity is *already* not a very viable path at the entry level for the most part, so your relevant skillset will need to shine on your resumé.

      "text": "Hi everyone, hoping to get some honest advice from people already working in cybersecurity.\n\nMy IT background (4 years) has been heavily user-facing and centered around end user support, i'm sick and tired of helping people restart their computer and unplug and plug in their monitors. I handle laptop troubleshooting, device deployments, incident tickets, onboarding/offboarding. Worked with Microsoft 365, SCCM, and have some exposure to Active Directory, Networking and audio-visual systems.\n\nI’ve also worked in environments that use security tools like endpoint protection and data loss prevention, but my involvement has mainly been from the client. As in on user's laptops itself.\n\nI’m based in Singapore and have completed a Bachelor’s in Computer Science. I also hold a Diploma in Network Defense and Forensic Countermeasure and AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certificate.\n\nMy goal is pretty straightforward — I want to move out of IT end user support and get my foot in the door in cybersecurity at ANY level. \n\nA few things I’d really like clarity on:\n\n1) Certificates - I know this question has been asked to death in this subreddit but seriously, what should I target first?\n\n2) Experience - I understand that 'Home Labs' are one way for someone with no experience to get the relevant experience, what would you suggest I should focus on learning and creating as a base project first.\n\n3) Skill - What skill is a must have in this field? I'm thinking I should break it down and start studying each one to an extensive amount. I have a lot of technical knowledge but not an expert in any specific part of IT other than end user troubleshooting.\n\n3) Pivot - If you made the breakthrough to cybersecurity from any helpdesk related field, how did you do it and what was your personal experience?\n\nI’m motivated and fully prepared to put in the work — just want to make sure I’m focusing my effort in the right areas instead of spinning my wheels.\n\nWould really appreciate any kind of guidance.",

They cover fundamentals like networking, threat landscape, ethical hacking basics, and digital forensics. Good for building a proper foundation instead of random learning.\n\nFor hands-on practice (which matters more than theory):\n\n* TryHackMe (free tier) – Great beginner path\n* OverTheWire – Free and solid for Linux basics\n* Professor Messer’s Security+ playlist on YouTube\n\nSince you know Python, build small security projects:\n\n* Port scanner\n* Log analyzer\n* Password checker\n\nProjects + hands-on labs will teach you more than just watching courses.\n\nStart with fundamentals → practice → build projects.

Should I focus on certifications to improve my chances? If so, which certifications are actually worth pursuing for someone at an entry level?

          "text": "The chances of you moving directly into a cybersecurity role are kinda slim. Most of the time you start in help desk for a decent sized MSP and start learning how companies use computers, software, and networks to accomplish their task. Once you learn the industry standard for software/setups etc. then you will see how bad actors exploit them. Active Directory, Office 365, Azure are all common systems used by companies to function. Learning how these systems are administrated and then eventually how they are exploited is your “phase 2” stage. Eventually you will start helping out with security related tickets and hopefully move into a security only role.\n\nThis is gonna be hard to hear, but colleges have been selling lies since cybersecurity became the next big thing. They make it seem like all you need is a degree with homelab experience and your set. This is simply not true. Companies are not going to hire you into a cybersecurity role with little or no hands on IT experience. They want experience supporting businesses with their IT infrastructure because that’s how you actually learn the trade. Cybersecurity will always be something you grow into from a standard tech. You simply must have the hands on experience that comes from doing standard business support. \n\nIn short, college isn’t helping you skip the line. Start off in a help desk role and grown into a cybersecurity SME.\n\n\nI have no degrees, only 1 cert (CompTIA SecurityX) and I have been promoted to a security only role. I have been in IT since 2021 working on a help desk. I gradually become more and more security focused and was then labeled as a subject matter expert for Cybersecurity related tickets.",

A completed degree gives you flexibility, as many of the skills you’ve learned, like networking, risk assessment, systems knowledge, and basic IT, are transferable to roles in IT management, project management, or general tech support. Even if you don’t go deep into security, having the degree can open doors in tech-adjacent fields and make your résumé more competitive.\n\nIf you’re truly not interested in cybersecurity, you could start exploring minors, certifications, or courses in areas that excite you, like IT, cloud, data analysis, or project management, while finishing the degree. That way, you get the credential without closing other doors.\n\nFor advice on bridging your degree to practical skills and career-ready experience, check out SecPro Academy.",

It’s not a deep technical cert.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean it has no value.\n\nCEH is a broad, structured overview of offensive concepts - attack phases, tooling categories, methodology, vulnerabilities, etc. For someone early in their career, especially without years of real-world exposure, that structured coverage can help connect dots across networking, web, malware, and defensive mechanisms.\n\nIt’s also still widely recognized globally. In some regions (including parts of Asia and government sectors), it carries weight. EC-Council has also updated CEH in recent years to align more with modern attack frameworks and MITRE ATT&CK mapping, so it’s not stuck in 2012 like some comments suggest.\n\nCEH won’t make you a SOC analyst. It gives you attacker perspective.",

Multiple that by the annual growth rate. That gives you a rough estimate on the number of net-new positions created annually for all things cybersecurity. Yes, there will be some variability as no one can accurately foretell the future.\n\nLook at the number of Bachelors (\\~100K+) and Masters (\\~50K+) degrees in related fields being awarded annually in the USA. This gives you an idea of the net-new supply of \"formal education\" candidates being added every single year.\n\nLook at the number of folks pursuing certifications to break into the field. Look at the numbers for CompTIA trifecta (A+, Net+, Sec+). Look at the number of users training services such as THM (\\~6 million) and HTB (\\~4 million) have; they are popular for a reason. This gives you an even better idea of the volume of potential candidates trying to get in. The THM and HTB users will be international so take a look at the global cybersecurity workforce size (\\~5.5 million) for comparison. Ask yourself how realistic is it that basically the entire global cybersecurity workforce is using just these two services or is there a lot of folks hoping this will get them a job?\n\nCompare the numbers and make your own assessment. At least your eyes will be open going forward.\n\n\\---\n\nBe careful chasing dreams based upon headlines and folks selling gold rush dreams.\n\nLook at green energy and the headlines about it being a key job growth driver for the USA. Wind turbine maintenance is the highest growing job in the USA with about 5% annual growth (50% over 10 years). Sounds great but that is only 680 net-new jobs per year. Solar installation techs are the second highest with 4.2% annual growth rate (42% over 10 years) which is only 1201 net-new jobs per year in the USA. Those numbers do not align with what was pimped. Will see how accurate these hold up as taxpayer money dries up.\n\nNurse practitioner is about 3.5% annual growth (35% over 10 years) and that is about 13.3K net new jobs per year in the USA.\n\nHome health aide is about 1.7% annual growth (17% over 10 years) and that is about 74K net-new jobs per year.

Instead, you should look at the quality of the school as a thing to leverage into an internship over the summer (or while studying) to 1) gain job experience and 2) get past a lot of roadblocks in the hiring process. If you truly want to be successful, you will have to hustle your butt off in college with networking to land a role after graduation. Even if you are in an internship there is less likelihood (than in the past) there will be a full time role available for you, but you have much greater odds of being hired where you were an intern.\n\nI would second another that if you really want to pursue cybersecurity, a computer science or IT degree focused on the technical stuff would likely be more helpful for a junior role. Unfortunately, a lot of cyber degrees don't have the time to get super deep in how systems function. And the rest of the policy development and strategy stuff, PARTICULARLY at the junior level, is seen as replaceable by AI.\n\nThe thing the other technical degrees will teach you is the debugging and technical investigation thought process, which is more useful than the content.

Doesn't exactly help me stand out from the millions of other applicants it looks like, and i'm not sure what else I could add on to stand out other than Networking.\n\nAlternatively, I can pursue a Criminal Justice degree with emphasis in psychology. I remembered that my training at AIT was transferable to a community college and that upon transferring my transcripts to them, I'd get an AAS in Intelligence Studies on top of the courses I'd be taking for my BA. If I pursue Intel at entry level or get taken on by a company that would sponsor me to renew my clearance, then increase my experience in that area, plus learn Cybersecurity on my own via self-learning methods and courses - this may be the better and most versatile way to get into CTI down the road, it sounds like.\n\nProblem is, I'd be putting myself in a box again. I have a medical condition with my eyes that may disqualify me for positions within the FBI or more field work in law enforcement, so I'd have to take an analyst approach, and i'm not quite sure on the job market in that field that isn't government.\n\nEither way, I'm not realistically looking to enter the field for 5-6 years minimum at this rate. \n\nAlso I appreciate your insight.

The **vast** majority of files on my computer are non-sensitive, so I do not want to encrypt the whole drive.\n\nFor the handful of files that should be kept secure, I would like to encrypt and lock them behind a password while retaining the ability to easily edit them when needed.\n\nOn my old Mac, I had a \"sparesimage\" where I could store sensitive files.  In the file browser, it showed as a single file.  I'd click it, it would prompt me for a password, and after entering the password it would mount as an \"external\" drive.  When I was done working with the files on the virtual drive, I would simply \"eject\" it and everything was locked behind the password again.\n\nThis was super handy, but I've moved on from macOS.  I'm currently using Windows 10, but will likely be switching over to Linux toward the end of the year when extended security support for Windows 10 ends.\n\nI looked for a similar feature to the sparesimage from macOS, but I'm not finding an equivalent in Windows 10.  Best I could find was encrypted folders, which don't seem to behave the way I want.  I can't seem to leave access to the folder perpetually locked behind a password.\n\nWhat would be the correct way to achieve my desired goal here?  Ideally it would be something that works on Windows AND Linux (and ideally natively with no extra software needed).",

Because of that, I was also considering other IT paths like networking or IT support as stepping stones into cybersecurity.\n\nHowever, the offer I currently have is for a Data Analyst role.\n\nI’ve been consistently studying cybersecurity, networking, and operating systems in my free time. The challenge is that I don’t have formal work experience yet — I’ve mainly been applying to junior/fresh grad security analyst roles and internships, but haven’t landed one.\n\nSo I wanted to ask:\n\n* Should I take the Data Analyst role?\n* Can this realistically help me transition into a SOC Analyst position later?\n* Has anyone here made a similar move?\n\nI don’t want to drift too far away from cybersecurity, but I also don’t want to stay unemployed waiting for the “perfect” opportunity.\n\nWould really appreciate your insights.",
