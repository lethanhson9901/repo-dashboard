Yeah anyone can learn this, just takes time and consistent practice.\n\nStart with basic IT stuff first - how networks work, Windows/Linux basics. Professor Messer on YouTube is free and covers this. Get CompTIA A+ or Network+ knowledge, then Security+ which is the baseline most jobs want.\n\nFor hands-on practice, CyberDefenders has tons of labs (log analysis, incident response, blue team stuff). TryHackMe and HackTheBox are good too. You can do this while studying for certs or even start with labs first, whatever clicks for you.\n\nIf you want a practical cert, CCDL1 is solid for entry-level blue team work. BTL1 is another option. These are hands-on exams that test actual skills.\n\n\"Godly\" takes years. Getting your first security job though? 1-2 years if you're consistent.",

This all may depend on the job, space force also seems less likely to deploy anywhere crazy (cept Tampa, FL lol) and probably has more opportunities to promote.  If I had to do it, I would do a cyber specific role with the space force.\n\nI work cybersecurity and did a technical role in the military and know a lot of others from various branches that did the same.  My consensus is that a lot of US military technical training usually sucks unless they have a purchased program from some vendor like GIAC, otherwise it can be a crapshoot where they're forced to complete certifications/training at a set pace really fast.  If you're a go-getter and self study, you can make up that gap, but the general intention for almost all roles, even those with high asvab is to specialize them and dumb the job down as much as possible so that the operational aspect of it is easier.\n\nThis leads to things like IT admins and helpdesk people that just reset AD creds all day long, but dont really know what AD is or the inner workings, cyber specialists that'll look at a specific vendor interface and escalates all medium level alerts.  The more technical deep dives almost always go to a civilian contractor.  There are definitely the handful that know what they are doing but aren't really allowed to deep dive either, you'll have technicians who could change out a part on something to get it operational, but the military doesn't wanna chance those guys and would usually just opt to replace a whole board or component via purchase something from Lockheed at ten grand instead when it could have been less than a dollar to fix sometimes. (Big with capacitors and stuff on boards on the elec tech side)\n\nYou also have a base already so you'd do well there compared to those who come in fresh and think they know what they are doing.",

They're shifting away from the traditional time-in-grade promotion model toward demonstrated competency levels (basic, senior, master).   \nWhat this means practically is that your existing certs and master's degree could potentially accelerate your progression more than in the Air Force's more traditional structure. They're also integrated their cyber squadrons directly with their Space Deltas, so you'd be doing mission defense work that's immediately tied to space operations rather than broader Air Force missions.\n\nThe catch? Space Force only has around 4,900 enlisted personnel total right now. That's tiny.   \nSo while you might face less competition and get more specialized experience, you also have fewer bases, fewer assignment options, and the career field is still being built out.   \nSome people love being part of something this new and having that kind of impact on how things develop. Others prefer more established structure.\n\nAir Force cyber is more mature and has way more positions and locations. They also have the Cyber Direct Commissioning Program that could actually be relevant for you – it lets experienced cyber professionals come in as officers with constructive service credit based on your education and certs.   \nWith your credentials, you might enter as a Lieutenant or higher rather than starting from scratch. That's a pretty significant advantage if you're 25 and want to fast-track your military career alongside your civilian cyber experience.\n\nHonestly, I'd reach out to recruiters from both branches and specifically ask about the officer route given your master's degree and certs.   \nYour profile seems better suited for commissioning than enlisting, and the conversation might look totally different.",

          "text": "People will say that Air Force cyber is more established, and that is true, but that also means that there are less opportunities. With Space Force being so new and so small, you can get alot of amazing opportunities (certifications, training, TDYs etc.) that would just not happen in the Air Force.\n\n\nIf you only want to do cyber, I would lean more towards the Space Force. Theres only 3 potential jobs (Cyber, Intel, Space Operator) vs in the Air Force where theres so many different AFSCs where in the worst case scenario theres a chance you could be stuck doing security forces or maintainer work. Air Force also owns traditional IT jobs too, so you might get a helpdesk or networking role potentially, which you probably wouldn't want to do given you already have SOC analyst experience.\n\n\nUltimately theres pros and cons to both. I would say if you want to join something thats already extremely established with clear paths for progression the Air Force is for you. On the other hand, if you want to join something early on, be given alot of responsibility from earlier in your career to innovate and shape how things are done, and are okay with a greater degree of self autonomy, the Space Force is for you.\n\n\nEither way both are good options. Whichever branch you decide on, if youre qualified for sign-on bonuses due to your certifications make sure thats explicitly stated in your final contract before you sign it.\n\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any questions, I was prior Air Force before I transferred over to the Space Force so I have experience on both sides.",

Over time she’s made comments that feel oddly specific to things I’ve done or discussed privately online, including very specific topics I’ve used ChatGPT for — which I thought was encrypted?\n\nThe person hasn’t had access to my devices and even if they did they’d need my passwords for it all so I doubt this is the case here. \n\nThere’s no hard proof of anything: no devices found, no obvious account breaches. It’s more a pattern that’s made me uncomfortable. Since I removed her from my social media (mainly because I felt I might be triggering her — she seems quite insecure and unhappy). I don’t think she is a good person and I sense a lot of malicious and jealous energy from her.\n\nI’m trying to stay balanced here. I don’t think she’s very well, and this could just be social dynamics, inference, or coincidence — but it’s started to affect how safe and relaxed I feel at home.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n\t•\tWhat can a WiFi admin realistically see in a shared house?\n\n\t•\tIs there any way private message or app content could be accessed via WiFi alone?\n\n\t•\tAt what point would concern be reasonable vs overthinking?\n\nI was under the impression WiFi can be monitored but just the websites visited rather than the searches.. I feel like she has access to what we are looking up online specifically. \n\nI’m changing passwords and tightening security anyway, but I’d really appreciate calm, practical input from people who understand this stuff.\n\nThanks!",

Encrypting your hard drive is useless if every website you visit knows who you are based on your screen resolution, battery level, or installed fonts. To improve your personal cybersecurity right now:\n1. Isolate browsing: Use containers to separate your social life from your finances (I see you already have separate systems, but you can use isolation tools within the same system).\n\n2. Make tracking visible: You need to know who's watching you before you can block them. I've developed a Tracker Scanner that shows you in real time which entities are collecting your data on each URL.\n\n3. Preventive blocking: Implement a shield that not only blocks ads but also stops silent data sharing. Since I'm building tools for this, I have the Scanner and Shield explained in the link in my profile if you want to audit your own browsing. Great job with that setup!",

Never click on links or attachments unless you were expecting them from a trusted source.

Never download cracked/pirated software, games/cheats/mods, torrents or other sketchy stuff.\n6.

Folder-level containers don’t help much against keyloggers—OS-level isolation (VMs or separate browser profiles) is more effective.\n\nFor ongoing hygiene, regularly remove leftovers after installs or updates so traces don’t linger.

Really depends on the type of role but you still have to collaborate with other teams. That collaboration/cross-function isn't always smooth.....you get a lot of push backs from them so it's critical to make sure you build a good relationship with other teams.\n\nSkills - I think technical skills are definitely good to have but from experience, that can always be taught so if anything, get the fundamentals straight then learn as you go. The soft skills is where it gets tricky, not everyone is good with people and with communication. So people/soft skills, communication, attention to detail, and curiosity will take you places.\n\nTraining - all those sites that provide hands-on experience. THM is always a great one I lead people to. Continue to study as much as you can, you will still do it even once you're in the industry. Attend local conferences/meetups and network as much as possible. The more you network and show up, the more you'll be seen and that can also bring opportunities.   \n  \nLastly, go for certifications. If you have a path in mind, get certs that will align to it. Otherwise start with the fundamentals. \n\nThat's basically what I did to eventually get to where I am.",

You need real experience being a jack of all trades, understanding the entire infrastructure and how it interacts.   You need to know at least the basics of how AD, Windows, Linux, Oracle, SQL, middleware, devops, storage, backups, ticketing, automation, alerting/monitoring, networking, firewalls, ect all communicate with each other and fit together, along with any of their unique characteristics, so you're not breaking anything and your policy actually applies to your infrastructure in a productive and protective way.   \n\nFor example, Large finance/banks still have AS/400s.  I worked for one, a F500, and they had AD login to the AS/400 (it's a mainframe).   The rule was all AD accounts had to have 12+ password length.  Johny security saw an OU that blocked that GPO and had a group of people who didn't have that requirement. \"All means all\" so they disabled inheritance and pushed the GPO.  AS/400 has an 8 character max limit.  No one could get into the system to run their year end financial reports needed for a board meeting.  These reports are needed for the CEO to provide information to all the shareholders in a publicly traded company, about next years projections and this years results, which directly affect the stock price.  That person was promptly fired, as they should be.  \n\nAs for training:  I have a B.S in security, the first graduating class in the US actually.  I left security after a few years because it sucked and the pay isn't what people think it is.",

The idea is simple: recognition is easier than recall. You don’t memorize strings, you recognize something personal.\n\n\n\nThe second controversial part: passwords are never stored.\n\nNot encrypted. Not hashed. Not in a vault.\n\n\n\nPasswords are regenerated on demand using cryptographic primitives, on-device checks and end-to-end encryption. If there’s a breach, there’s literally no password database to dump.\n\n\n\nThis raises a real question: If you were designing password security from scratch today, would you still use a master password at all?\n\n\n\nLooking forward to hearing honest takes… supportive or critical. 🙏🏻 \n\n",

Microsoft tried something similar in Windows 8 - you'd draw gestures on a photo instead of typing a password - and it turned out pretty vulnerable.\n\nResearchers at Arizona State cracked like 48% of them because people are super predictable. Everyone picks the obvious stuff - tap on the eyes, draw a line across someone's nose, circle the sun in a landscape photo.   \nPlus it's way easier to shoulder-surf someone tracing a pattern than it is to catch a typed password.\n\nThe part I'm stuck on is the \"passwords are regenerated on demand\" thing. That sounds cool in theory, but there's gotta be *something* stored server-side to verify against, right? Like even with zero-knowledge proofs, the system needs an anchor point to check if what you regenerated is correct. Otherwise how does the server know you're you?\n\nI think the bigger problem is that the industry's already kind of moved past this whole concept. **Passkeys (FIDO2)** are blowing up right now- like Bitwarden saw a 550% jump in people creating them last year. The whole point there is that your device holds the private key and nothing ever leaves it, so there's literally nothing to steal server-side.\n\nNot trying to rain on your parade, genuinely curious how your verification works without storing any reference point. The devil's always in the implementation.",

Right now I work in corrections and I'm looking for a way out that doesn't completely tank my income.\n\nMy question, would an associates degree in Networking and Cyber Defense help me get started? I have no experience in IT or cybersecurity and am looking for a starting point. My local community college offers an associates that I think may give me that starting point. Are there any job positions that would be applicable to me with just an associates + some certificates I could earn at the same time?\n\nI'm not opposed to getting a 4-year degree, but I am considering the associates first to get my foot in the door. I do have a bachelor's in psych and two associates I completed in high school, so I have a lot of college credits to knock the gen eds out of the way.",

Yes, a lot of what you hear it's true that Cybersecurity isn't an entry level job and it's challenging to get into, but I want to encourage you to ignore all that. If you really want to get into it, you're going to continue to educate yourself whether it's a short degree program or a long one. \n\nMy recommendation would be to go for that associate's degree and potentially go for a certification at the same time (if possible) and apply right away. Don't let the big requirements intimidate you. Yes, some and most companies definitely want someone who really know what they're doing. After all, they'll be protecting the business. But apply regardless...anything between internships to IT roles and Security analysts roles, I would say go for it. \n\nNow, if you know exactly what you want to do then target those roles. \n\nBut my point is that you're just being proactive while you're continuing to equip yourself with more knowledge and hands-on experience (of your own). If you get called for an interview, take it as an opportunity and get to know what companies are asking and looking for which will help you prep even more. \n\nEvery story is different and unique.....you have your own and you can definitely make it happen for as long as you continue to grind. \n\nBest of luck and don't be afraid to reach out and ask additional questions if you have any!",

There are jobs in cyber that pay well, but they normally require certifications or proven skills in certain technologies, and some require degrees. Cyber isn't really a starting point, it can be, but normally you needs to start somewhere else and then transition to cyber after gaining experience. Normally, an IT service desk or software development maybe. But Cyber is also very broad so there isn't one direct path. So you could do it with an Associates Degree, but you need to pick one area in cyber to build your skills and experience. Also, build a home environment to practice the skills. This is the best way to learn, by doing it. For the degree program you are looking into, I would try to get into a program that has the option of getting certifications in cyber while you are in school, as well as hands on labs and things.

Get. A. Linkedin. Account!\n\nOpen ChatGPT, ask it the following:\n\n\"Please guide me through creating a resume by providing a framework that I can fill out that is suitable for a male 20 yo that is [insert some of your best qualities i.e. strong work ethic, mechanically minded, analytical, great with people etc]. \n\nI am looking to apply for jobs that are in the [insert industry]. I have the following skills/qualification [insert skills/quals].\n\nI have ever written a resume, so please give me a guide on best practice and the usual sections that will help me create a solid resume\"\n\nOnce it churns that out, follow the guide and then ask it the following:\n\n\"Please look at my resume attached/pasted below and give me guidance on how I can improve it.\"\n\nRinse, repeat the step before until your resume is awesome.\n\nAsk it to do the same with writing a Linkedin profile.\n\nNext prompt:\n\n\"You are a recruiter for a top recruitment firm that hires exceptional candidates for companies that require hard-working and smart young adults. Please look at my resume (attach or cut/paste it) and rewrite this for my Linkedin profile so that I stand out and I am a top candidate for those browsing Linkedin\"\n\nOnce it churns it out, ask the following:\n\"Please look at my Linkedin profile and rewrite it in any areas you feel are not showing me to be an exceptional candidate\"\n\nOnce it is done, attach an image to ChatGPT and ask the following:\n\n\"Please look at the image and convert it to a professional headshot that doesn't change my features or my over all face, but just ensure the lighting looks amazing and I look professional, in a suit and tie\"\nOnce that is done, post it to your Linkedin profile.\n\nNow let's look for jobs.\n\n\"I want you to find jobs in the [insert city/area] area that meet the following criteria:\n\n-Must have a salary posted >$xx,xxx  -does jot require a degree \n-hours \n-no/minimal/1yr experience required \n-has healthcare \n-in the [insert industry] industry \n-has whatever other criteria is important to you \n-been posted for less that 1week.\n\nPlease post the results in a table and include the following info if available:\n\n-link to job \n-salary \n-zip code \n-hours \n-industry \n-any other criteria\"\n\nThen post your resume and/or Linkedin to the jobs.\n\nIf it needs a cover letter.... back to ChatGPT:\n\n\"Please write a cover letter for the following job advert using my linkedin profile/attached resume.  Keep it short, easy to read and provide a camples of why I am a good candidate with examples to back it up\"\n\nRegarding jobs in Vegas\n\n-MGM is always hiring security guards but might have to be 21 yo.\n\n-All the casinos have jobs going, just search their jobs pages in Google. Bog casinos are MGM, Caesars, Station and Boyd Gaming.\n\n-Taskrabbit, Airtasker, NextDoor are all apps you can post to and say you are keen, hard working and what your hourly rate is.\n\n-Open Google maps, find an area and look at all the businesses. Click in them, open their website and email a resume to them. If they dont have an email address then send them a link to your Linkedin profile to their contact form.\n\n-Walk the streets. Get dressed up smart, clean shaven, brush your hair and go into businesses and ask if they are recruiting. Regardless, give them a physical copy of your resume. No printer, no problem. Download the Blinq app and add your details to there. Put your resume in a Google Drive/OneDrive and in your Blinq profile add the link to the cloud drive with your resume. DoNOT leave any place without them taking a physical or E-resume.\n\nBest of luck dude!\"",

Also, the dude that said get a LinkedIn is trippin. Statistically it has the highest number of ghost jobs, and all the real ones get scooped up as soon as they're posted. Use websites like BuiltIn or YCombinator jobs. I don't get a response on every single job that I apply to through those two, but I do get a response on between 25% and 50% of the positions I've applied to. I have never once had a response for any position that I was qualified for or even overqualified for through linkedin. LinkedIn is garbage and so is anyone that suggests that you use it. The moment that you started you will have to constantly be a shill and/or a ball licker for any company you've ever worked for because bad-mouthing them on LinkedIn is a sure way to never get a job again on LinkedIn. As is not posting frequently on LinkedIn. This is the problem with LinkedIn you have to treat it like a social media site and treat it like it's a job posting site and be super corporate PC never say anything wrong and every company you ever worked for was perfect and never had any issues. Don't get sucked into the LinkedIn hole bro.",

The \"info\" section is copy pasted from my actual page. For context, I did OF in the past (inactive for 4 years and deleted for at least 3 years now) and it seems to be an old pic from then, so I'm assuming it's an old sub who's being creepy and trying to get attention. I'm not precious or ashamed about my past, but this feels sort of stalker-y given that I'm not some huge influencer or public figure, so I'm kind of spooked, and also just not a  fan of this floating around.\n\nI have reported the page and gotten it removed 3 separate times now and I just saw that it's back up again!! With a different profile image this time. The last 2 times I filed a formal impersonation report with IG where I sent them a pic of me holding my ID and everything. That doesn't seem to make any difference, except that the page gets removed for maybe 1 day. \n\nI really don't know what to do here. I'm feeling extremely frustrated that this keeps popping up and that IG is ignoring my reports over & over. I want to take legal action if this happens again, but in the meantime I just want the page gone!!\n\nAny advice?",

They layer a few lighter checks instead. Things like sampling-based memory monitoring (eBPF-based tools, heap profiling at intervals, not constant) + anomaly detection on access patterns rather than raw memory reads.\n\nOne thing that helped us reduce noise was tying alerts to *behavior change* instead of absolute thresholds. Like, memory regions suddenly being accessed by processes that normally never touch them, or queries behaving slightly off during normal DB ops. That catches quiet leaks without paging people every hour.\n\nAlso runtime checks don’t always need to be security-only tools. We’ve used perf + observability data (latency, alloc spikes, GC weirdness) as indirect signals. Not perfect, but surprisingly effective.\n\nI came across a short breakdown recently that explained this angle pretty clearly, focusing on post-deploy monitoring rather than pre-checks. Nothing groundbreaking, but practical.\n\nCurious what others are doing too, especially in prod-heavy environments where alert fatigue is already bad.",

Conducting risk reviews and translating that to non-technical leaders  \n2. Generating artifacts for audits  \n3. Giving general cybersecurity advice  \n4. Building inventories and forms  \n5. Creating incident response final reports (logs, actions taken, recovery, lessons learned)\n\nThings that I'm not the best at:\n\n1. Deep technical work (Scripts) - AI helps with that   \n2. Reacting under extreme stress\n\nI'm open to a lot of different things. I do value work-life balance and a somewhat predictable environment. ",

I would love for some advice on how to go about this. \n\nThe software dev position would start in January of this year, and given that the company likes me and I like them, I would stay with them till I graduate in December. Few things, it’s a smaller company, from what I’ve read it’s outdated and meh code. \n\nThe Information Security position is with a much larger company and would start in my (summer semester) and the internship would run from May - May. A couple tasks I would work on described to me are essentially doing access audits. So why does this person have access to this DB when they don’t ever use it, that type of stuff. \n\nSo, I was looking for some advice on what to do when it comes to this summer. Obviously, I’m going to take the software dev position from January to May, as I think that will look great on the resume. However, do I stay with the software dev or go into the Information Security position? Also, obviously if I HATE the software dev company I’m going to leave without a doubt, but in the most perfect of worlds with both to choose from what do you think. I have always wanted to go into cyber leaning roles and I feel this may be a great stepping stone into that position. I will also note, I have IT experience working for my university.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. ",

This can happen if they setup email forwarding or using POP/IMAP for remote email access (check Gmail settings for both of these). In Google Accounts an attacker might have also created an Application Password which is used to bypass 2FA, so go into your Google account's security settings to look for Application Passwords and remove any you don't recognise (or remove all of them and recreate any you 100% need, such as older network connected printers/scanners)\n\nBeyond that, a compromised or virus infected computer would be another way for an attacker to get access to other sites, sometimes through browser session/cookie stealing.  Backing up your important files and doing a format and reinstall is probably the best way. And of course do a virus scan across your backed-up files to make sure they're clean too.",

Infostealers - downloading cracked/pirated software, games/cheats/mods, torrents, free movies, etc. almost always steals your session cookies which allows a bad actor to access your accounts without needing your password or 2FA. Doesn't matter if you trust the site or have used it in the past. \n2a. Fake Captcha - copying and pasting code that you don't understand into the Windows run command either uploads your session cookies directly or downloads an info stealer that does that automatically.\n\nRemediation for all of these is largely the same. \n\nFrom a clean device, NOT your PC:\n\n1. Change ALL of your passwords to something unique and randomly generated. \n2. Choose the option to log out of all active sessions or devices. \n3. Enable 2FA on all of your accounts \n\nIf you are guilty of the 2nd reason continue below:\n\n4. Nuke your PC from orbit\n- back up only important files, not games or applications \n- format your hard drive \n- reinstall Windows from a USB drive\n\nUnfortunately, the only people that can help you are the support teams for those services. If you're not able to get the accounts back, nobody here can help you. \n\nAnyone that contacts you via DM offering to help or to hack the accounts back is just an account recovery scammer looking to take advantage of your situation.",

The problem is that the course is extremely disorganized. Topics are often taught badly, without a clear structure, and sometimes we’re pushed into very advanced subjects without having the necessary fundamentals. For example, we had malware analysis in the first year, without proper background in operating systems, networking, or programming.\nAt this point, I’m really struggling to keep up with exams. I feel like I’m not properly learning new skills, and instead of progressing, I feel blocked. On top of that, this course is slowly making me hate cybersecurity, even though I know I like it and I’m sure it’s the field I want to specialize in and work in.\nUnfortunately, I can’t just quit. I need to finish this course because it’s the only way to access a guaranteed internship provided by the institute. They place students in partner companies, and there’s a real chance of being hired after the internship.\nSo I feel trapped between forcing myself to finish a course that’s draining my motivation and confidence, and knowing that the internship could be my real entry point into the industry.\nHas anyone been in a similar situation? How did you deal with a bad or poorly structured program without burning out or losing interest in the field? Any advice on how to survive this phase while still building real cybersecurity skills on my own?",

I originally studied mechanical engineering but later realized it wasn’t what I wanted to pursue long term. After that, I worked in a tech support role for about 2 years, which helped me build a solid IT foundation.\n\nFrom there, I started my cybersecurity journey by purchasing a Hack The Box subscription. I began with the basics—networking, web fundamentals, and core security concepts. It took me roughly 8 months of consistent effort to build confidence and complete my learning path. Eventually, I was able to switch internally into a security role, and that’s where I am today.\n\nI’m not fully aware of the job market situation in your country, but my suggestion would be to stick with your current course and complement it with practical learning. Consider platforms like Udemy for structured learning and Hack The Box for hands-on practice. Also, working toward a certification such as CEH or OSCP can significantly improve your chances of landing an entry-level security role.\n\nAs for programming, I personally don’t think deep programming skills are mandatory for penetration testing anymore, especially with the rise of AI. I do know the basics, but for most of my assessments, AI-assisted tooling is more than sufficient. That said, if you’re planning to move into fields like digital forensics or malware analysis, strong programming skills are still very important.\nFell free to ping me if you have any questions.",

The state of the art in academia and industry shows that wholly client side message inspection like naive CSS can create privacy harms rather than solve abuse. Metadata and user flagging capture a lot of problematic content without breaking E2EE guarantees. The more scalable realistic route is to build layered defense. This includes upstream user signals, downstream moderation workflows, external threat intelligence, and behavioral analytics, not unlocking every message. Tools like ActiveFence follow that layered philosophy. They aggregate contextual intelligence, pattern detection, and risk scoring across signals you can inspect without direct decryption. This does not solve the paradox but reframes it. You accept imperfect detection in exchange for preserving privacy guarantees activists care about and then mitigate risk through smarter non plaintext dependent methods.",

If a lot of people are using the VPN it can be a bit of a challenge to map it back to you, but it’s mostly just a problem of time and effort.\n\nI point this out because most people using VPNs today have been taken in by all the podcast ads, and don’t actually understand the degree of supposed “protection” they provide, or the degree of risk that they add. VPN can be a useful tool for some use cases, but for most users it’s a significant net negative. It’s digital snake oil.",

If what you are seeking is anonymity, that can nearly always be backtracked.\n\nHow are you acquiring your phone and SIM card to avoid records?  How are you paying for your data plan?  How are you paying for your VPN?  \n\nThere is a pretty good book, The Art of Invisibility, written by Kevin Mitnick, that outlines steps and best practices for decreasing your digital footprint and keeping yourself more secure…but be aware that 1.  Many VPNs, regardless of their stated retention policies, will comply with court orders, even if that means data retention only after they’ve received the order.  2.  There are cameras and records of things everywhere.  3.  Many countries will require some sort of identity verification to activate a SIM.\n\nSo, just imagining a scenario…you buy a SIM, your equipment now has an IMEI and IMSI.  That IMEI will be associated with your IMSI from the service provider.  Chances are pretty good that the store you bought that SIM from has some sort of surveillance/security cameras, so now footage of you exists making that purchase.  You sign up for a commercial VPN, everything seems good, you do something stupid and break the law…in a big time way…now that VPN gets a record retention request that is valid in the country they operate out of…if they comply, the IP address you connected to the VPN through as well as your activity logs are turned over to law enforcement.  With that IP address, the cell phone carrier is requested to turn over any user data including ID verification data, tower registration data, and your IMEI.   A watch is put out in areas where your device frequently registers, and you’re trying to enjoy a bowl of cereal when you notice your cell phone getting a little warm and a really strong signal, and before you know it, some guy holding a device that mimics a cell tower is honing in on your position.\n\nClosing your browser/locking your phone may delete the data from the device, but they’ve got the data from the VPN, they’ve correlated your pre-paid data plan burn rate with the activity from the VPN, they’ve got the device and SIM, and have the video of you purchasing the SIM in the first place.  You’re cooked.\n\nSo, privacy, yes…anonymity…no.  Don’t break the law.",

A lot of people finish a cyber degree and hit this exact wall, especially without internships.\n\nAt your stage, I wouldn’t overthink the “perfect” role. Most grads I’ve seen start by targeting SOC analyst (tier 1), IT support / helpdesk, junior security analyst, GRC / risk analyst, or even sysadmin / NOC roles. They’re not glamorous, but they get you real experience and exposure to how security actually works in companies.\n\nNot having certs isn’t fatal, but getting one entry-level cert can really help your resume get past filters. Stuff like Security+, SC-900, or even a cloud fundamentals cert if you’re leaning that way. You don’t need 5 certs, just proof you’re still learning.\n\nAlso, don’t underestimate labs and projects. Home labs, TryHackMe, Hack The Box, small writeups on what you learned — hiring managers care way more about that than people think. I came across a breakdown/roadmap online that explained this pretty clearly and it helped me narrow what to focus on instead of spiraling (can’t remember the exact post but it was on a niche cert prep site, not reddit).\n\nBig thing: apply even if you don’t feel “ready”. Entry-level cyber is already competitive, and nobody expects a fresh grad to know everything. You’re not behind, you’re just at the messy starting part that nobody talks about.\n\nIt’s nerve racking, yeah, but this is normal. One small step (cert, lab, applications) is way better than freezing up trying to plan the whole career at once.",

There are a lot of things that can be a sign of people on your network that aren't supposed to be, but those can also be harmless.

For the computer, the disappearance of files could mean that someone is there, or it could have been an accidental deletion while you or someone else was on your computer. \n\nIf you suspect anything wierd there are a few questions to ask yourself any time you see anything weird on your computer or mobile device. From easiest to check to hardest to check. \n\nIs my anti-virus software running or installed? \n\nWhen was the last scan of my devices for viruses? \n\nDo I need to make sure my virus definitions are up to date? \n\nIs there an unknown device on my network (i.e. You should be able to log into you router and see which devices are connected)?\n\nIs there traffic happening at odd hours (i.e. when everyone is sleeping or when everyone is at work/school. This will requre a tool like wireshark running and capturing traffic at the router for you to see traffic across the network)? \n\nDid I install something shady (i.e. software from a unknown source or untrusted author, cracked video games, free movies from those pirate sites)? \n\nDid I open a link or attachment in an email from an unknown sender? \n\nDid I click on a bad link from a website? \n\nIf you suspect something is malicious or just plain odd, change all your passwords and restore your system to a previous known good state.

I currently have had 2 Summer internships between my senior year of HS to now, one being legal and the other being in an information security department -- both were at law firms. Last October I got an offer for a cyber-related internship at really good tech company for Summer 2026 and from what I understand they tend to give out return offers unless I am just incompetent (feel free to comment on this if you can). Now that I've gotten the offer, I just had some questions based on how I schedule the rest of my classes.\n\nCurrently I am double majoring in CS and Economics and for some info about me, I don't really see myself ever becoming a full-fledged Cyber engineer or anything SWE-adjacent. I've seen the lifestyle and work and I just don't think I derive happiness long-term from it, however I do love tech and think Cyber is definitely the most interesting field there is. Was planning for something more GRC or management focused atm, but back to the thing at hand -- within my university I have already taken all the Cyber related courses and to finish the CS major I have to take 3 EXTREMELY hard Math\\*\\* classes along with the rest of the Econ curriculum.\n\nSince I already got this internship offer, I've had some debate over finishing with both degrees, or just econ and settling with the minor. Since I've already done all the Cyber electives, I was thinking about just taking all the electives that I think would help me like Database Systems and things similar and just settle with the Econ Major, CS minor title. If I wanted to finish with the double major I'd have to do these classes during my 4th year along with the other econ curriculum and from a personal standpoint I know I can be fine if I try, but I really just don't want to go through all that work/stress if the upside isn't that much.\n\nBasically, what I'm asking is if its important now or down the line to have the double major title of CS & Econ Double Major or settling with just the Econ major CS minor granted I do already have some experience in the field.\n\nOpen to all comments and advice!",

Many security experts advise people to not even open an unknown email message out of an abundance of caution. Meanwhile, the full payload of the malicious software is not necessarily contained within the email message. For example, an attachment or malicious hyperlink embedded in an email message often links to an external website managed by the bad actor. Clicking on the attachment or hyperlink then downloads or activates the malicious software from their web server. Because the malicious software is hosted on a server that email providers do not manage, and because threats are evolving and changing constantly, email providers cannot ensure protection from every potential threat.\n\nBecause the specific actions taken by the malware are not necessarily known, and because the threats are changing constantly, it is best to be equally cautious about unknown emails regardless of the device you are using.",

The occasional no click vulnerabilities that appear are rare, which means expensive. Unless you are a high value target, there would be no reason to risk blowing an exploit like this. With that being said, this advice only applies if you do not use AI, as things like prompt injection are a known issue. One other point that I haven’t seen being made, is the fact that a pixel can be added to the email, so when it is opened a url is hit and the email address is verified as being valid/active. This can lead to more spam/suspicious emails. If you really wanted to play around/have fun you could set up a dummy email and sandbox. Send any suspicious emails to the dummy email, and only open in a sandbox, and you greatly reduce any risk you may have had.",

I'd say the experience was ok, my main issue with them is that after a full year they couldn't remove my info from all websites they found initially.\n\nThis experience made me realize that while removing my PII from people search websites is important, I was still missing several things: private brokers, government records, data breaches, spam (physical and digital), phone calls, etc.\n\nThis year I want to try a different approach. I just canceled Optery, and got Cloaked. My plan is to slowly replace my identity from some websites, and hide my email and phone number as possible. So that's the proactive aspect.\n\nFor the reactive aspect of it, I'm considering Incogni (mostly because of private brokers vs Optery), and Privacy Bee (because of the extended features for vehicle, physical spam, etc.) on top of Cloaked.\n\nHas anyone tried an approach similar to this? It is difficult to assess these services practical value based on theoretical advantages of how they protect US consumers. Any insights between Incogni and privacy bee assuming Cloaked is there already?\n\nThanks!",

In there should be camera permissions where you can see all apps that are allowed to access you camera. You can disable anything you don't recognise, and if any apps do need that access you can come back and enable them one at a time. \n\nWouldn't hurt to look at your currently installed apps and uninstall anything you're not using. For apps you don't recognise, be careful and do some searching/reading first before you uninstall them, as some apps listed might be operating system components that apps rely upon (e.g. Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables)\n\nI'd also suggest doing an offline virus scan (run Windows Security > Virus & threat protection > Scan options > Microsoft Defender Antivirus (offline scan))\n\nOn a side note, duct tape leaves residue, so the common recommendation is a Post-It Note over the camera, but if the root cause is someone hacked into your computer then you have bigger problems (e.g. stealing your passwords etc)",

Infostealers - downloading cracked/pirated software, games/cheats/mods, torrents, free movies, etc. almost always steals your session cookies which allows a bad actor to access your accounts without needing your password or 2FA. Doesn't matter if you trust the site or have used it in the past. \n2a. Fake Captcha - copying and pasting code that you don't understand into the Windows run command either uploads your session cookies directly or downloads an info stealer that does that automatically.\n\nRemediation for all of these is largely the same. \n\nFrom a clean device, NOT your PC:\n\n1. Change ALL of your passwords to something unique and randomly generated. \n2. Choose the option to log out of all active sessions or devices. \n3. Enable 2FA on all of your accounts \n\nIf you are guilty of the 2nd reason continue below\n\n4. Nuke your PC from orbit\n- back up only important files, not games or applications \n- format your hard drive \n- reinstall Windows from a USB drive\n\nUnfortunately, the only people that can help you are the support teams for those services. If you're not able to get the accounts back, nobody here can help you. \n\nAnyone that contacts you via DM offering to help or to hack the accounts back is just an account recovery scammer looking to take advantage of your situation.",

You spend weeks fine tuning your scanners and making sure every single image is clean and every policy is enforced but then production starts acting up anyway and you are left scratching your head because the dashboard says everything is green. I am just so tired of the disconnect between our dev environments and the reality of what happens under actual load because these exploits are just so sneaky. Logs are basically useless in the beginning because they do not show anything is wrong until the damage is already starting to spread. It is incredibly frustrating to tell your boss that the pipeline said everything was fine but the live cluster is telling a completely different story. Has anyone here actually dealt with this kind of nightmare in a live environment or found a way to bridge that gap because it feels like our current tools are just missing the point entirely.",

You can get clearance, and touch just about every kind of electronic device out there. In the right market/agency the pay is good, the benefits and time off are very good.\n\n3-5 yrs in law enforcement sets you up to move to the private industry with a ton of experience, skills, and certifications that no private company is going to pay for.\n\nworking in law enforcement doesnt mean you have to have a badge and a gun.

I hate fighting with vm drivers and such on mac\n\nI also like that I can use a network interface for a vm without putting an ip on the physical.  so the vm gets an ip and is exposed to L3, but the host is not.  with windows, it doesnt work that way\n\nwindows to me feels 'bloated'.  \n\nlinux is nice but device drivers can be a pita depending on hardware\n\nif I had to pick a windows machine, the surface laptops are pretty nice form factor wise and mac-like.  you can deck them out with decent ram and ssd as well\n\nthey'll all had advantages and disadvantages; just a matter of where you want to put your effort into\n\nalso, docker is super sexy simple on a mac (and git and many other cmd-line dev tools for that matter).  if your plan is to lean into docker, ansible and git - I would strongly consider a mac\n\nyou can always pick up an inexpensive used M1 to try it out.  the newer models would just be faster / more capable, but trying it before fully committing would make sense in your scenrio",

Was speaking to a friend recently who is in cybersecurity, is younger than me, didn’t do too well in school but took an online course which came with vouchers to exams that lead to him having 4 certifications. Initially landed a job for 45k GBP which is above what most university graduates get paid and 6 months later, is now on 80k GBP working 6hrs a day Mon-Fri, fully remote. \n\nI was looking to potentially make a career shift this year after a short break because I’m kind of bored of Finance/can’t see myself doing it long term (I’m only 2 years into my career) but I had not even considered cybersecurity as an option. Luckily I spoke to him and he mentioned all of this, now I’m starting to think this might be an option worth exploring.\n\nThe main selling points for me being working remotely + the reduced hours but still getting very well compensated. I would like to use the extra time to build income sources outside of work/start side hustles, much of which I’m very limited in at the moment due to my work hours but also restrictions due to my industry. \n\nIs he just really lucky or is this a realistic ask for someone who would like to transfer over from Finance. I have some coding experience with python from my current role, but besides that I’d be a newbie taking the same course he did which he sent me a link for. \n\nThanks for any tips/advice/guidance. ",

By the time I get out I’ll have right around 5 years of IT/cyber experience, and I’m seeking advice on what more I should be doing now to better prepare myself for this job market that doesn’t seem to be in a good spot at the moment. \n\nMy goal is to land a cybersecurity role right after separation, ideally in something along the lines of a GRC or Cybersecurity Analyst role, “potentially” a security engineer role if I’m realistically ready for it. I also understand that my clearance can open doors for DoD Contracting roles, which could end up being the smartest route, still trying to figure that out. \n\nFor some more background other than the 5 years of IT/Cybersecurity experience and the clearance, I have quite the cert stack (most are from WGU bachelors program): A+, Net+, Sec+, Data+, CySA+, PenTest+, CASP+, ITILv4, Linux Essentials, SSCP, CCSP, CC\n\nI should be very close to completing my masters degree by the time I separate as well. Would also say that I’m approaching proficiency in Python if that matters. \n\nPutting aside what I’ve done already, I’m hoping for some advice on things such as:\n\n-What skills/additional skills should I be prioritizing over the next 18 months?\n\n-What kind of home labs or personal projects are worth doing in my position (if any)?\n\n-What hiring managers are actually looking for in a candidate right now, including for cleared or DoD adjacent roles.\n\n-Any networking advice or just any other advice in general that could be beneficial to me.

Keep your mouth shut, don’t overshare.\n\nI am a CISSP and work in healthcare IT now.  If you go the govt or contractor route make sure you get onto a long term contract.  I mean a contract with 5-10 years of shelf life.\n\nNever stop learning or upgrading your skills.\nDon’t get stovepiped- meaning know a lot about everything.  \n\nGrads that come from college with a cybersecurity degree are essentially worthless if they don’t understand networking, how os’s work, etc…. They’ve got a really nice piece of paper and might now how to use nano but don’t understand the nuts and bolts.\n\nAi is coming for programmers, then basic helpdesk, then sysadmins….
