      "text": "I’ve been seeing OneRep recommended more and more lately as a solution for dealing with data broker and people‑search sites, so I finally took some time to dig deeper into what these services actually do and whether they’re worth it. I get the general concept: instead of personally tracking down every random site that has scraped your info and going through dozens of different opt‑out pages, you hand the job over to a service that automates the removal requests and keeps monitoring for new listings. On paper, that sounds great, especially if your name shows up all over the place or you just don’t have the time or patience to keep doing it manually.\n\nAt the same time, I’m still pretty conflicted. Part of me really likes the idea of having something in the background constantly checking for new data broker listings and sending removal requests without me needing to think about it. But another part of me feels uneasy about giving yet another company access to my personal details in order to “protect” my privacy. There’s also the question of how much they can realistically remove, how quickly, and whether everything just pops back up again later.\n\nSo for anyone who has actually used OneRep or a similar privacy/removal service for a while, I’d love to hear how it felt in practice. Did it make a noticeable difference to how often you find your info on people‑search sites? Did it feel like a meaningful long‑term privacy improvement, or more like paying a subscription for convenience—something you could more or less replicate on your own if you were disciplined enough to stick with manual opt‑outs and periodic checks?",

Proper integration across a cybersecurity stack can be difficult, to say the least. Understand that \"advanced threat detections\" within a siloed solution area are often not \"false positives\" but rather events that happened that are termed to be an \"alert\" - that event happened but it's just not necessarily a threat or something a practitioner cares about. The detections that are written by hand are often correlating between these siloed solution areas bringing higher fidelity to those alerts. In other words, three or four alerts together make a positive/positive but any one of them by themselves is just an event. Creating these types of correlated alerts can be difficult with a set of siloed tools that are generating AI/ML detections that don't have the details within those findings that enable effective correlations and conditional alerts. I would also call out that Deep Learning is often overlooked to broaden the scope of detection beyond structured data and LLMs. It is a heavy lift to get those advanced threat detection mechanisms working together to best understand their context across the various solution areas. A mature SOC has solved these issues. What you're describing here is a SOC that has all the pieces of the puzzle but haven't put them together to see the complete picture.",

I was thinking about considering cert after cert ( not buying them for now ) and study their content like those listed in the image, \n\nmy question is should i continue in web security and go for bug bounty to affoard their certs exams and at the same while study for a specific cert path like ejptv2 or choosing one thing to do beside my college study ? and sorry for the verbosity.\n\nTarget: penetration testing and bug bounty for now ",

Since your target is penetration testing and bug bounty, I’d suggest going deeper into web security first and building real-world skill through platforms like Hack The Box and real bug bounty programs while studying for something practical like eJPT or PNPT before jumping into more advanced certs. Focus on mastering one lane instead of chasing multiple certificates at once, and let certs validate skills you already built. If you want a clearer, step-by-step penetration testing roadmap without second guessing your path, SecPro Academy structures it in a way that aligns well with both bug bounty and red team goals.",

When joiner/leaver automation, conditional access, and Windows login MFA are aligned, support tickets drop significantly.\n\nThe biggest problems usually don’t come from MFA itself.

But if you’re genuinely curious about how things break at a low level, not just that they break, it compounds hard over time. The people who do it for money usually quit. The ones who do it because they can’t stop thinking about it become irreplaceable.\nMy honest take: keep PT as your income engine, start RE on the side. Reverse one malware sample a week. No course, just a sample and a debugger. In 6 months you’ll know if it’s actually for you, or if you were just attracted to the aesthetic.\nTwo skills that overlap is a moat.

You spend your entire time at that duty station being a glorified secretary.\n\nThere are certain programs that if you test into they will send you to additional schooling.

Warrants get certs for sure. 17C don’t get certs in AIT but get a ton of hands on experience. The AF has been redesigning its cyber jobs and I’ve only worked with a red team that actually knew what they were doing. The army’s cyber teams actually do their job in both cyber protection teams via various threat hunt type missions that are actual threat hunts. Red teams do actual red team work. I can’t speak at all for the Navy. \n\nThe army has changed when it comes to that mentality of Soldier first. That typically comes from middle management leaders who don’t know the technical niche of what those Soldiers do. As long as you are in a cyber protection bde you WILL do cyber protection jobs. Upside you wont do vulns scans such as acas and trellex for IA reporting. You will do assessments looking for anomalies in SEIM logging especially when nothing alerts. You will help organizations set  up alerts based on known ATPs. You will help provide data that will brief organizations leadership on how to close gaps in current security posture to close gaps. \n\nI’ve seen some AF teams do the same but more from the army than any other service. Good luck what ever path you chose.",

You may work on extremely legacy systems as well which is unlikely to mirror private sector environments. \n\nThat being said. join the AF, get guaranteed a-school for cyber (preferably with a short or no wait between boot camp and a school) and join up. Do it for a few years and see what the world looks like then. Cybersecurity/IT in general is a terrible market, but the military is basically guaranteed job if you are eligible.",

Start with networking fundamentals, Linux, and basic security concepts like how attacks happen and how systems are defended.

Once you’re comfortable, you can explore areas like ethical hacking, SOC, or cloud security to see what fits you best.

From there, explore areas like ethical hacking, SOC analysis, or cloud security to see what interests you most. Hands-on practice through labs and entry-level certifications can really help build confidence.

BUT you dont work in a silo alone.. you will work as part of a team (probably not a remote team) .. \n\ncomputer science is probably 10% of what you need to learn as you grow. if you go to an in person university.. and actually take advantage of the resources and opportunities at the university you'll learn ALOT.. and experience a lot..   \n\\- learn how to show up on time, deliver projects on time  \n\\- work with others, work with people not like you, that dont talk or work like you do.   \n\\- deal with difficult people, people you dont understand and some you dont even like in person.   \n\\- do things you dont think are relevant and useful.. this sounds stupid.. but its probably 60% of any job.   \n\\- taking criticism from people you like.. and many you dont like or respect but have to listen to anyway  \n\\- learn to talk to people and interact in person in a professional way.   \n\\- learn to write/type and express yourself via email, written reports, and other means of communication  \n\\- learn to fail.. and fail alot.. and keep going. \n\nas for CS and coding.. yeah you can learn it from some YouTube videos in your moms basement.. or you can learn it from a professor in a classroom full of other people with really interesting ideas and approaches you wont see or hear listening to a YouTube video. \n\nI've been in the industry 25yrs.. I'm a director and hiring manager at this point. When I hire someone, I'm not just hiring them to code or do \"cs things\" I'm hiring them to progress through the company and grow with the company.. that requires a 4 yr degree. CS is easy to teach. the being a human, learning to adapt and deal with people is not something I want to teach. (I shouldn't have to)\n\nin person universities offer research assistantships, you can work at the IT department on campus, and there are tons of clubs and organizations to get exposure and experience. you cant and wont get that anywhere else. You interested in AI, well the university has a AI cluster with 2terabytes of vram. you wont find that or have that opportunity anywhere else. robotics, there is a club for that, and 10 professors doing research. data visualization, yeah its there too. the opportunities are there.. even at a \"shit university\" but you have to look for them. \n\nyou also have to think about your competition. when I post for a new job, I get 300+ applications for one position. how do you compare? how would someone compare that has \"self taught\" on their resume to people with degrees and experience? why would someone in my position pick you over someone with a 4 yr degree and all the same skills you have? what skills would you have they wouldn't? \n\nuniversity is far far more about you growing as a human, opening your mind to all different kinds of people and opportunities, and learning to take advantage of the world around you.. instead of saying \"my university is shit, I can learn this on my own\" \n\nthats the kinda things you need to think about.

I didnt feel like the CS program was up to date, we never talked about the internet, GUI's .. or all the things I thought were relevant. \n\n25 yrs later, looking back:  \n\\- I learned an absolute TON .. and I learned all the things I needed to learn :  \n\\* I learned a really really strong foundation in programming AND problem solving. I learned how to break big problems into small problems and take them iteratively.   \n\\* I learned to debug and problem solve.. if things didnt work I learned how to sort out why and debug them.   \n\\* I learned to teach myself and learn on my own.. HUGE skill in the industry  \n\\* I learned about a ton of different kinds of people and cultures by being stuck in classes and labs with people completely different than me. (just like in the workforce)  \n\\* I learned to deal with good people and bad people (good employees/professors and terrible ones)  \n\\* I learned to get the tasks done even if I didnt agree with it or understand.. (only to find out many of the useless tasks and assignments turned out to be things I really needed to learn and use)  \n\\* I learned to balance and regulate life, work, school.. my mental and physical health  \n\\* I got on some amazing research projects and play with super computers, GPU's and be around (and learn from some truly brilliant people) .. not just professors but classmates too\n\n<this is the \"back in my day\" section>  \n\\- we didnt have google, stack exchange, reddit or many online resources, no chatGPT or Claude.  \n\\- we had books, and a lab where everyone got together and worked through assignments and projects together. we learned together. THOSE SKILLS are as important as anything you learn in a book. If you needed an example or had a problem that wasnt outlined in the book.. you had to try different things until you found a way to make it work. \n\n  \nyou cant learn cyber without a solid foundation in tech.. you cant understand networking and cyber attacks if you've never worked in a business network.. its really hard to learn forensics if you've never worked in a business environment with the windows registry, group policies, servers, etc. \n\neveryone wants to get to work, make 6 figures, and work remote.. but without a solid foundation (education + experience) you're setting yourself up for failure.. without those things you'll be the first laid off.. then you'll be back in the application pool with more people with an education and experience.. \n\nslow down.. do things right.. be patient.. LEARN the right way.. take advantage of the opportunities right in front of you. \n\n\"what if i improve my skills so good that i beat someone who has a degree\"  \n\\- you're asking \"what if I'm the exception to the standard way of doing things\" .. how many people are the exception vs the standard normal people.. ? you're assuming you're going to leap ahead of the formally educated people by sitting at home watching YouTube videos and learning on your own.. while some of the people in school are taking classes by day, working, and learning more on their own. \n\ndo you want to risk your career and forward progression on betting on being the exception when you have the opportunity to be trained and learn in person?

I have checked multple sources and it is one owned by a \"regional\"/very local ISP.\n\nI also have HubSpot Buyer Intent enabled on the website. Interestingly enough a business shows up for these entries. More specifically an IT/CyberSecurity Business.\n\nWhen I google the business, it has 1 employee, and that business lies right smack dab in the middle of the geographic area of the ISP's coverage. The business is a little difficult to find, but has a YouTube channel, where said person identifies themselves.\n\nFrom my end I have blocked and unblocked the IP range on the CDN and Website side, when I unblock the hits persist.\n\nWhere my head is at is I am a bit annoyed, it took a few hours to figure this out and seems a bit amateurish in nature. I don't know this person from Adam other then they are in the IT industry and if they are doing this to my business, how many other businesses are they doing this to?\n\nAm I within my right to file an IC3 and present the facts as they are?",
