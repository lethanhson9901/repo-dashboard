Get. A. Linkedin. Account!\n\nOpen ChatGPT, ask it the following:\n\n\"Please guide me through creating a resume by providing a framework that I can fill out that is suitable for a male 20 yo that is [insert some of your best qualities i.e. strong work ethic, mechanically minded, analytical, great with people etc]. \n\nI am looking to apply for jobs that are in the [insert industry]. I have the following skills/qualification [insert skills/quals].\n\nI have ever written a resume, so please give me a guide on best practice and the usual sections that will help me create a solid resume\"\n\nOnce it churns that out, follow the guide and then ask it the following:\n\n\"Please look at my resume attached/pasted below and give me guidance on how I can improve it.\"\n\nRinse, repeat the step before until your resume is awesome.\n\nAsk it to do the same with writing a Linkedin profile.\n\nNext prompt:\n\n\"You are a recruiter for a top recruitment firm that hires exceptional candidates for companies that require hard-working and smart young adults. Please look at my resume (attach or cut/paste it) and rewrite this for my Linkedin profile so that I stand out and I am a top candidate for those browsing Linkedin\"\n\nOnce it churns it out, ask the following:\n\"Please look at my Linkedin profile and rewrite it in any areas you feel are not showing me to be an exceptional candidate\"\n\nOnce it is done, attach an image to ChatGPT and ask the following:\n\n\"Please look at the image and convert it to a professional headshot that doesn't change my features or my over all face, but just ensure the lighting looks amazing and I look professional, in a suit and tie\"\nOnce that is done, post it to your Linkedin profile.\n\nNow let's look for jobs.\n\n\"I want you to find jobs in the [insert city/area] area that meet the following criteria:\n\n-Must have a salary posted >$xx,xxx  -does jot require a degree \n-hours \n-no/minimal/1yr experience required \n-has healthcare \n-in the [insert industry] industry \n-has whatever other criteria is important to you \n-been posted for less that 1week.\n\nPlease post the results in a table and include the following info if available:\n\n-link to job \n-salary \n-zip code \n-hours \n-industry \n-any other criteria\"\n\nThen post your resume and/or Linkedin to the jobs.\n\nIf it needs a cover letter.... back to ChatGPT:\n\n\"Please write a cover letter for the following job advert using my linkedin profile/attached resume.  Keep it short, easy to read and provide a camples of why I am a good candidate with examples to back it up\"\n\nRegarding jobs in Vegas\n\n-MGM is always hiring security guards but might have to be 21 yo.\n\n-All the casinos have jobs going, just search their jobs pages in Google. Bog casinos are MGM, Caesars, Station and Boyd Gaming.\n\n-Taskrabbit, Airtasker, NextDoor are all apps you can post to and say you are keen, hard working and what your hourly rate is.\n\n-Open Google maps, find an area and look at all the businesses. Click in them, open their website and email a resume to them. If they dont have an email address then send them a link to your Linkedin profile to their contact form.\n\n-Walk the streets. Get dressed up smart, clean shaven, brush your hair and go into businesses and ask if they are recruiting. Regardless, give them a physical copy of your resume. No printer, no problem. Download the Blinq app and add your details to there. Put your resume in a Google Drive/OneDrive and in your Blinq profile add the link to the cloud drive with your resume. DoNOT leave any place without them taking a physical or E-resume.\n\nBest of luck dude!\"",

Also, the dude that said get a LinkedIn is trippin. Statistically it has the highest number of ghost jobs, and all the real ones get scooped up as soon as they're posted. Use websites like BuiltIn or YCombinator jobs. I don't get a response on every single job that I apply to through those two, but I do get a response on between 25% and 50% of the positions I've applied to. I have never once had a response for any position that I was qualified for or even overqualified for through linkedin. LinkedIn is garbage and so is anyone that suggests that you use it. The moment that you started you will have to constantly be a shill and/or a ball licker for any company you've ever worked for because bad-mouthing them on LinkedIn is a sure way to never get a job again on LinkedIn. As is not posting frequently on LinkedIn. This is the problem with LinkedIn you have to treat it like a social media site and treat it like it's a job posting site and be super corporate PC never say anything wrong and every company you ever worked for was perfect and never had any issues. Don't get sucked into the LinkedIn hole bro.",

School will not teach you this. \n\nI worked in IT from being helpdesk to management and then went over to cyber. \n\nShort answer, get into IT. Learn a computer, how they work, how networks work, how a network packet is broken down. \n\nI got the cyber job and then got Certificates just to backup if I decide to leave my company. I have no real college exp except for like 2-3 semesters. I realize my comment is all over the place, so feel free to ask any further questions and I’ll try to answer to my best ability. \n\nAlso.. cybersecurity has so many facets, same as IT… you should have an idea of what you want.

In my case, I'm passionate about it so it brings me joy anytime I remind myself how I got to be where I am. \n\nWors part - for the most part, you have to cross function with other teams. Really depends on the type of role but you still have to collaborate with other teams. That collaboration/cross-function isn't always smooth.....you get a lot of push backs from them so it's critical to make sure you build a good relationship with other teams.\n\nSkills - I think technical skills are definitely good to have but from experience, that can always be taught so if anything, get the fundamentals straight then learn as you go. The soft skills is where it gets tricky, not everyone is good with people and with communication. So people/soft skills, communication, attention to detail, and curiosity will take you places.\n\nTraining - all those sites that provide hands-on experience. THM is always a great one I lead people to. Continue to study as much as you can, you will still do it even once you're in the industry. Attend local conferences/meetups and network as much as possible. The more you network and show up, the more you'll be seen and that can also bring opportunities.   \n  \nLastly, go for certifications. If you have a path in mind, get certs that will align to it. Otherwise start with the fundamentals. \n\nThat's basically what I did to eventually get to where I am.",

You need real experience being a jack of all trades, understanding the entire infrastructure and how it interacts.   You need to know at least the basics of how AD, Windows, Linux, Oracle, SQL, middleware, devops, storage, backups, ticketing, automation, alerting/monitoring, networking, firewalls, ect all communicate with each other and fit together, along with any of their unique characteristics, so you're not breaking anything and your policy actually applies to your infrastructure in a productive and protective way.   \n\nFor example, Large finance/banks still have AS/400s.  I worked for one, a F500, and they had AD login to the AS/400 (it's a mainframe).   The rule was all AD accounts had to have 12+ password length.  Johny security saw an OU that blocked that GPO and had a group of people who didn't have that requirement. \"All means all\" so they disabled inheritance and pushed the GPO.  AS/400 has an 8 character max limit.  No one could get into the system to run their year end financial reports needed for a board meeting.  These reports are needed for the CEO to provide information to all the shareholders in a publicly traded company, about next years projections and this years results, which directly affect the stock price.  That person was promptly fired, as they should be.  \n\nAs for training:  I have a B.S in security, the first graduating class in the US actually.  I left security after a few years because it sucked and the pay isn't what people think it is.",

The idea is simple: recognition is easier than recall. You don’t memorize strings, you recognize something personal.\n\n\n\nThe second controversial part: passwords are never stored.\n\nNot encrypted. Not hashed. Not in a vault.\n\n\n\nPasswords are regenerated on demand using cryptographic primitives, on-device checks and end-to-end encryption. If there’s a breach, there’s literally no password database to dump.\n\n\n\nThis raises a real question: If you were designing password security from scratch today, would you still use a master password at all?\n\n\n\nLooking forward to hearing honest takes… supportive or critical. 🙏🏻 \n\n",

Lighting changes basically eliminate colour, background is gone, different angles eliminate most distinct features. Does that just leave small, middle, large?\n\n\nThis is paired with a 3d collectable as a second factor. Chosen from a small set this doesn't seem to add a meaningful level of protection.\n\n\nAlso storing passwords or storing the means to regenerate the passwords seems like no practical difference. Requiring some property of the device to regenerate is like requiring a key stored on the device, but not as robust.\n\n\nCrypto isn't really the place for new and interesting.

          "text": "Honestly, this reminds me a lot of what happened with Windows Picture Password back in the day. Microsoft tried something similar in Windows 8 - you'd draw gestures on a photo instead of typing a password - and it turned out pretty vulnerable.\n\nResearchers at Arizona State cracked like 48% of them because people are super predictable. Everyone picks the obvious stuff - tap on the eyes, draw a line across someone's nose, circle the sun in a landscape photo.   \nPlus it's way easier to shoulder-surf someone tracing a pattern than it is to catch a typed password.\n\nThe part I'm stuck on is the \"passwords are regenerated on demand\" thing. That sounds cool in theory, but there's gotta be *something* stored server-side to verify against, right? Like even with zero-knowledge proofs, the system needs an anchor point to check if what you regenerated is correct. Otherwise how does the server know you're you?\n\nI think the bigger problem is that the industry's already kind of moved past this whole concept. **Passkeys (FIDO2)** are blowing up right now- like Bitwarden saw a 550% jump in people creating them last year. The whole point there is that your device holds the private key and nothing ever leaves it, so there's literally nothing to steal server-side.\n\nNot trying to rain on your parade, genuinely curious how your verification works without storing any reference point. The devil's always in the implementation.",

          "text": "Short answer: passwordless is not less secure, but it is not always more secure. It depends on what replaces the password.\n\nA few practical points:\n\n* **Passwordless mostly improves usability.**\n\nRemoving memorized passwords reduces password reuse, poor password choices, and phishing. That's a genuine victory.\n\n* **Something still needs to be established that it is you.**\n\nEven if there is no \"master password,\" the system uses a secret, a device key, a biometric, a seed, or a recovery factor. That is what attackers will target.\n\n* **\"Passwords aren't stored\" is excellent, but it's not the complete picture.**\n\nMany secure systems do not save passwords directly. The essential question is whether there is a reusable secret that can be duplicated and replayed.\n\n* **Device security is more important than the login mechanism.**\n\nIf a device has been compromised or account recovery is inadequate, passwordless access is ineffective. Today's breaches primarily target tokens, sessions, or recovery flows rather than passwords.\n\n* **Recovery flows define actual security.**\n\nHow difficult would it be for an attacker to imitate someone who has lost their device or photo? That's where systems typically fail.\n\n* **If we designed it today**\n\nWe'd avoid sharing secrets entirely, instead using device-bound cryptographic keys and keeping credentials short-lived. The user's choice of whether to tap a photo or input something is secondary.\n\n**So, no, passwordless is not less secure by default.**\n\nHowever, it is only more secure when it eliminates shared secrets and weak recovery paths, not when it just alters the user experience.",

It's nice to take a break (to go shower and sleep).. some ideas come to me in the middle of the night and in the morning I can just sit down at the keyboard and pickup right where we left off. \n\nAlso with chatgpt,. I find many times if I get stuck or I think a particular approach is not working as I hoped,. it's easy to just say \"Hey, this particular approach we're using, I'd like to set it aside for a moment and try a different idea. how about we do X process instead ?\".. and boom.. you're exploring a new solution-path. \n\nYou have to remember that chatgpt is just a tool. A tool can be used in different ways. It's not always about \"I expect the 100% perfect answer after 1st question\". Sometimes the conversation is a \"process of elimination\" (\"Hey, we've eliminated X and also eliminated Y,. so let's focus on Z\".. etc) \n\nI've found it super super helpful. \n\nI'm semi-familiar with Linux (have been fiddling with it also since the mid 90's) but nothing deep. I recently bought a Framework 13 Laptop (preconfigured with Windows) and was going to swap out the internal SSD and install Fedora. I started a conversation with ChatGPT asking it what recommendations it would have and etc.. it laid out a plan with a variety of options and recommendations and helped me along the way (how to partition the drive, certain drivers to install, certain ways to do certain things, etc.. I found it super helpful. \n\nThe one thing I can say.. LLM chatbots are not \"perfect\".. but often I find its my fault for not including complete context. I've found that instead of simply trying to describe things,. it's way better to just drop in a screenshot and let the LLM see the error. 9 times out of 10 this results in better analysis.",

You have most certainly already been using \"AI\" and not realized it, because it wasn't hyped up like that. There's... a lot of hype around \"AI' rn bc it's marketable. It'll pass.\n\nAs for Gen AI, which you specifically mentioned in your title- stuff like chatgpt is bad for a variety of moral/ethical/financial/legal reasons, like plagiarism, misuse of global resources, being a front for surveillance, inaccurate information, waste of time, etc. That said, there's types of GenAI that are trained on a small set of data for specialized reasons. They do not swallow massive amounts of energy and global resources. They are also not hyped up because they do not feed the global surveillance beast. They will probably exist in their very niche uses after the \"AI' hype train passes. Mid-2025 a lot of companies dropped their initial buy-in to the \"gen AI\" hype. My company's literal \"priorities and goals\" at the end of 2024 was \"more AI!!!\" and this year it's \"oh my god, can we get rid of this? it is causing more work for more money\". It's like when companies hire those \"consultants\" that feed them \"solutions to save money\" that they implement (at great cost) before walking it back. They literally disabled recording on MS Teams because it was the only way to turn off Teams AI \"meeting summaries\" because the \"summaries\" were the literal opposite of what happened in the meeting, and it was causing serious issues. They implemented some \"sentiment analysis\" thing for customer service and are now walking it back because it's throwing up red flags (I think from a legal/ privacy perspective?) They went from \"AI everything gen AI is efficiency!\" to spending massive amounts of resources to remind/ beg people to please not upload sensitive/confidential data into AI chatbots (including the \"corporate\" one) because that's a legal no-no.\n\nMy friend literally worked for a (niche) genAI company and initially swore up and down that \"in \\_\\_\\_ amount of time, all these things will be automated!\" and now admits that 80% of it is actually made up. It's a product they HOPE to produce, and they claim these things work in order to secure investors so they can actually attempt to build it, but the building isn't working. There is a LOT of money put into \"AI' that's gonna crash and burn. Which is why they're trying to convince consumers to buy-in, because they want regular people to put their money into it so the investors can pull some of their lost \"investments\" back out. As more people invest in, they're going to get fanatically desperate in their support. Kinda like a pyramid scheme! lol. It will be unpleasant but it will pass.\n\nIt's good to know how the current technology functions. Observe how other people use it. Learn how and where it fails (it fails a lot!) Learn how it's used for cybercrime and how to fight it. You do not have to actually use it yourself or anything you feel is unethical. I didn't implement any (gen AI) for work, don't have to use any myself, and now am the person helping set up security against them or decommissioning them. It will be fine.",

At work, especially in IT (maybe not if you're a coder). They just care you deliver results. We all already use Google, even the 10, 20, 30 year veteran, we still use Google, cause we don't know everything and we can't remember everything. AI is just a smarter Google.\n\nGuess what else will make you want to use AI? Performance reviews, weekly reports - other stupid paperwork that none of the IT professionals like to write - proposals, project plans, SOPs, every fluff to make management feel warm and fuzzy while doing none of the work.\n\nYou'll want to learn to use AI to do that. But you'll also want to learn how to actually do it yourself, so you can make sure the AI is doing it right and editing it. AI still teach me new ways to phrase things more politically, or reminds me of works and phrasing I've forgotten. But AI is also like a junior worker, you have to WATCH it, you have to review its work. In your case of being a newly grad, the AI is actually smarter than you because it has A LOT more training than you. Ask it if you're supposed to say something in such way that are you about to in an email. I bet sometimes it'll tell you you come across the wrong way (it's NOT always right though). But do write your email yourself, you can have it help you tweak a sentence or two if you're not sure.\n\nAnd guess what, almost nobody will care you use AI if you do the paperwork right that way, or write a doc correctly. You may not know this yet, but a lot of IT involves reading error logs to troubleshoot, sometimes if you're lucky this is only 5 lines, if you are NOT lucky, these can be hundreds and thousands of lines. Guess who reads faster than you and won't miss a single character mistake like you?\n\nLearn to use it, learn to love it for the things it can do for you. Even if bubble burst some day, it will still have some use. It's at worst a better phone assistant than what we had in previous generation. Yes you are getting a bubbled perspective. It's a tool, the world is moving. It's here to stay in some form or another. Get over it. Really, it's better that you do, in THIS career.\n\nIf you work in anything else I can't say I'd give the same advice. I don't have the relevant data.\n\nEdit: didn't notice which subreddit I'm in. Think cyber when I say IT. The rest still stands.",

The state of the art in academia and industry shows that wholly client side message inspection like naive CSS can create privacy harms rather than solve abuse. Metadata and user flagging capture a lot of problematic content without breaking E2EE guarantees. The more scalable realistic route is to build layered defense. This includes upstream user signals, downstream moderation workflows, external threat intelligence, and behavioral analytics, not unlocking every message. Tools like ActiveFence follow that layered philosophy. They aggregate contextual intelligence, pattern detection, and risk scoring across signals you can inspect without direct decryption. This does not solve the paradox but reframes it. You accept imperfect detection in exchange for preserving privacy guarantees activists care about and then mitigate risk through smarter non plaintext dependent methods.",

If what you are seeking is anonymity, that can nearly always be backtracked.\n\nHow are you acquiring your phone and SIM card to avoid records?  How are you paying for your data plan?  How are you paying for your VPN?  \n\nThere is a pretty good book, The Art of Invisibility, written by Kevin Mitnick, that outlines steps and best practices for decreasing your digital footprint and keeping yourself more secure…but be aware that 1.  Many VPNs, regardless of their stated retention policies, will comply with court orders, even if that means data retention only after they’ve received the order.  2.  There are cameras and records of things everywhere.  3.  Many countries will require some sort of identity verification to activate a SIM.\n\nSo, just imagining a scenario…you buy a SIM, your equipment now has an IMEI and IMSI.  That IMEI will be associated with your IMSI from the service provider.  Chances are pretty good that the store you bought that SIM from has some sort of surveillance/security cameras, so now footage of you exists making that purchase.  You sign up for a commercial VPN, everything seems good, you do something stupid and break the law…in a big time way…now that VPN gets a record retention request that is valid in the country they operate out of…if they comply, the IP address you connected to the VPN through as well as your activity logs are turned over to law enforcement.  With that IP address, the cell phone carrier is requested to turn over any user data including ID verification data, tower registration data, and your IMEI.   A watch is put out in areas where your device frequently registers, and you’re trying to enjoy a bowl of cereal when you notice your cell phone getting a little warm and a really strong signal, and before you know it, some guy holding a device that mimics a cell tower is honing in on your position.\n\nClosing your browser/locking your phone may delete the data from the device, but they’ve got the data from the VPN, they’ve correlated your pre-paid data plan burn rate with the activity from the VPN, they’ve got the device and SIM, and have the video of you purchasing the SIM in the first place.  You’re cooked.\n\nSo, privacy, yes…anonymity…no.  Don’t break the law.",

The plugged in headphones look just like a usb does when plugged in. With a folder of 3 undeletable files that I am supposed to add my downloaded music to.
