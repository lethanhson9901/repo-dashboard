I'm deeply involved in corporate security stuff, but usually it was for entertainment companies or online learning platforms. Now my friend invited me to take on a new job in a new niche (iGaming), and I agreed... =(  \n  \nSo now messing up with gambling product and trying to get serious about igaming fraud prevention but nothing helps. I just don't understand where to look and where to find proper solutions. Like, I've never had anything to do with this before, and the devil made me agree to go work at this place (the funniest thing is that the income isn't much more than at my old job, so yes, I'm a loser, lol).\n\nI’m trying to understand how fraud prevention software in this niche works, but the internet seems completely empty. In any case, I'll most likely leave team in the near future, but I am obliged to at least set up some kind of real-time fraud monitoring for them, otherwise it would be unprofessional and unfair on my part.\n\nIf you’ve implemented something and it actually reduced fraud, what solutions worked?   \n  \npls **no companies names** as I don't want to turn this post into one big ad!!!",

      "text": "hi there! I’ve been trying to clean up my online footprint after discovering that several people-finder and data broker sites were publishing surprisingly detailed profiles about me, including past addresses and even family connections. and honestly, that rabbit hole led me to data removal services, which claim to automate opt-outs from dozens (or hundreds) of these sites instead of doing it manually one by one.\n\nafter realizing how many providers exist, I decided to put together a comparison table for my own research and figured it might be useful to others here as well. The table compares multiple data removal services across things like geographic coverage, number of brokers monitored, recurring removals, transparency, and general usability.\n(comparison block included below)\n\n\nPricing & value\n- OneRep: 5-day trial; $8.33/mo (1) or $15/mo (up to 6). Family = expert + custom removals; Individual = fully automated.\n- DeleteMe (Abine): subscription (mostly annual/multi-year); benchmark ~$129/yr (1); couple/multi-year options.\n- Incogni (Surfshark): standard $7.99/mo (annual); Unlimited $14.99/mo (annual); Family up to 5.\n- Optery: free- paid tiers; e.g. Extended $14.99/mo, Ultimate $24.99/mo; ultimate adds human support + custom removals\n\nCoverage (people-finder  or data broker sites)\n- OneRep: 310+ sites.\n- DeleteMe: claims 976 brokers (published list).\n- Incogni: 420+ sites + (unlimited) 2,000+ for custom removals.\n- Optery: plan-based 640+ (or 400+); plus 1,125+ total via custom requests (ultimate).\n\nOngoing scans & recurring removals\n- OneRep: monthly scans + ongoing removals; new brokers added.\n- deleteMe: ongoing service with recurring opt-outs; quarterly reports.\n- incogni: recurring removals.\n- Optery: monthly automated scans & removals.\n\nReporting & visibility\n- OneRep: monthly email reports.\n- DeleteMe: dashboard + reports; quarterly privacy reports.\n- Incogni: dashboard + regular reports.\n- Optery: progress/risk reporting; some plans include before/after screenshots; quarterly reports\n\nThis started as personal research, so I’m very open to feedback and your experience! If you think I missed any important providers or criteria, feel free to point it out. I’d love to refine this into something genuinely helpful for people trying to choose a service without getting overwhelmed",

While 400 to 600 brokers sounds comprehensive, it leaves a massive vacuum for the thousands of smaller, deep-web scrapers that actually fuel those \"shadow profiles\" and lead to re-indexing.  \n  \nIf you’re looking for a more aggressive \"deep clean,\" it’s worth checking out CrabClear. It automates removals across 1,500+ data brokers, which is a massive jump from the usual 420 600 sites covered by providers like Incogni or DeleteMe. By hitting the mid-tier and niche aggregators that the bigger services often overlook, you actually stop the cycle of your information trickling back up to the major people-finder sites.",

Everyone wants in, mostly because they’ve heard that’s where the money and opportunity are. So here’s the question: if you’re a strong, well-run cybersecurity company that treats its employees well, offers real training and growth, and has plenty of work, do you really need to advertise on LinkedIn to find talent?  \nChances are, no. That kind of company probably already has:\n\n* A stack of resumes in HR’s inbox\n* Former employees trying to return\n* Current employees referring friends who are eager to join\n\nNow let’s look at the jobs you *do* see on LinkedIn and similar sites. They tend to fall into a few categories:\n\n* **Ghost jobs** – posted to give the illusion of growth to shareholders, with no real intent to hire\n* **Resume collectors** – companies stockpiling applicants “just in case,” or monitoring industry trends\n* **Clueless postings** – they don’t know what they want or need\n* **Terrible offers** – the job is posted because no one wants it due to bad pay, bad culture, or bad leadership\n\n",

Whilst there are good programs out there, most are pretty lacklustre. The real thing you should be doing is looking at summer placements and internships with companies you'd be interested in working for; that will help you stand out.\n\nA degree without those placements will mean you'd be competing with people that may have a few years in a related role looking to get into SOC, dev work, etc. Which will count against you.\n\nEdit: also, the skills are pretty transferable if you're looking at the engineering and automation side. There is a certain truth to the idea that the market is saturated for both CompSci and Cyber, but it's also a little overblown. If you're trying to get in with absolutely no experience, of course it's going to be hard.

          "text": "I do cyber consulting, but this is not a sales pitch. I am in various phases of POC/selection/implementation/refinement with a number of clients, including those whose cyber programs we manage.\n\nPros:\n\n* Way faster connectivity for remote users to on-prem service access based on the product we/they chose in a couple clients. An executive was across an ocean and had faster connectivity than he used to have at his house in the US. File shares, ERP, databases, everything is faster.  User experience is generally positive, even with the hiccups.\n* Much more fine grained access to resources. One example: RDP was required for a subset of users due to some niche compute requirements. Now that is much more controlled.\n* We are 4 (?) months into one I'll reference. VPN is still available for the IT team, but all users in all sub-companies are migrated to the platform. There were hiccups, but was surprisingly smooth. Most hiccups were related to \"Oh I didn't know so-and-so used resource XYZ and we just blocked their access to it\". \n* Amazing shadow IT detection. You'd be surprised what people use their work computers/accounts for if you have never been able to filter or sanction specific applications.\n* We didn't buy a static IP. Instead, we created an Azure compute instance as a connected tunnel and route all URLs requiring static IP for origin to that. It works well, but only do that if you are willing to add that slight overhead, as it would be much easier to just have it in the platform. We only needed that because some SaaS subscriptions require it for org access.\n\nCons: \n\n* Management absolutely requires more effort. If your implementation partner (if there is one) isn't handing over documentation on WHY they implemented a certain way and where you should go/make changes in the future efficiently, it will eventually turn into spaghetti (like most tools though). This wasn't a deal breaker (obv), but is a consideration for a small team like you said.\n* Captive portal detection: it might be limited to one product or configuration (as you said, complex product that continually needs refinement) but for the life of me some airlines just will not let the agent detect it is captive with some vendors. It results in a \"travel\" AD/Entra group and some device setting rules that allow people to turn off the agent when they are traveling. Not ideal, but working through it. Probably platform specific, but I promise it's not an obvious dumb config mistake (\"oh just turn on that widget!\").\n* We have a pain point managing local breakout/device profiles on some platforms. Admin interface is a compromise between features and overhead to manage it. \n* The right vendor absolutely depends on a couple factors, and it is easy to choose the wrong one. If you have server initiated traffic (Microsoft SCCM, some RMMs, etc) that is a limitation in the space. Others are AMAZING and present this super-duper-awesome DLP capability, but remember that additional capability usually means additional management overhead. If you don't tag data today?\n\nIn closing: users, execs, and IT personnel like it compared to the VPN. We would do it again (and continue to recommend) for most use cases. Spend the time on a POC/POV with all the features you are looking to license to validate your use cases. Where I see most difficulty is not the tool limitations (although that still is there) but in your implementation/architecture choice. Sales people are used to matching need key words -> SKUs. They are NOT good at knowing you are looking for the \"good enough\" version of what you are trying to do. ",

Otherwise it would have been apparent for ALL users over the last few months.\n\nIn the SMB space where you have much more simple environments, or you can change subnets easily, you may have less problems. Some of my clients are growing through acquisition so while the initial integration is easy, the refinement over time is still a challenge, like if there are overlapping subnets for private resources between companies. But that is also just a challenge of integrating two companies together.",

          "text": "[Here is a recent article from someone who routinely tests AI models](https://shumer.dev/something-big-is-happening).\n\nFrom my perspective, Cybersecurity falls into the realm of \"needs someone to accept legal responsibility and has regulatory hurdles.\" It's at the very least enough to buy time if there are big shifts coming as the author claims. AI has a lot of unsolved (and maybe unsolvable) problems in the realm of security, as things like prompt injection don't seem likely to go away anytime soon.\n\nHowever, it's all relative to what CEOs and corporations decide to prioritize. Cybersecurity is *already* not a very viable path at the entry level for the most part, so your relevant skillset will need to shine on your resumé. I can't imagine that an incoming wave of AI capable of washing away >50% of entry-level white-collar job helps that prospect much at all.",

I handle laptop troubleshooting, device deployments, incident tickets, onboarding/offboarding. Worked with Microsoft 365, SCCM, and have some exposure to Active Directory, Networking and audio-visual systems.\n\nI’ve also worked in environments that use security tools like endpoint protection and data loss prevention, but my involvement has mainly been from the client. As in on user's laptops itself.\n\nI’m based in Singapore and have completed a Bachelor’s in Computer Science. I also hold a Diploma in Network Defense and Forensic Countermeasure and AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certificate.\n\nMy goal is pretty straightforward — I want to move out of IT end user support and get my foot in the door in cybersecurity at ANY level. \n\nA few things I’d really like clarity on:\n\n1) Certificates - I know this question has been asked to death in this subreddit but seriously, what should I target first?\n\n2) Experience - I understand that 'Home Labs' are one way for someone with no experience to get the relevant experience, what would you suggest I should focus on learning and creating as a base project first.\n\n3) Skill - What skill is a must have in this field? I'm thinking I should break it down and start studying each one to an extensive amount. I have a lot of technical knowledge but not an expert in any specific part of IT other than end user troubleshooting.\n\n3) Pivot - If you made the breakthrough to cybersecurity from any helpdesk related field, how did you do it and what was your personal experience?\n\nI’m motivated and fully prepared to put in the work — just want to make sure I’m focusing my effort in the right areas instead of spinning my wheels.\n\nWould really appreciate any kind of guidance.",

Improving security posture, balanced access control, and knowing EVERYTHING.\n\nI'm a low paid help desk analyst, been doing it for years. I reported a misconfigured Entra app that the infrastructure team setup that allowed all of our 13000 odd users to query everyone's personal (not work) email address. \nSec team never caught it, pen testers never caught it, auditors didn't catch it, but this analyst did ;)\n\nAnyway, my point is that a lot of people have certs, degrees, and know how to use the tools. That tells a hiring manager that you can do the tasks assigned to you.\n\nBut do you have any extra knowledge or examples to sell? \n\nIf not... Try and do a mini audit of what can you see as a endpoint tech. Are security baselines set, are you still using legacy protocols like smb1, is a DR procedure in place, is there any software with unpatched software in your environment.\n\nIf you can find a few bits for improvement, you can sell that you led security posture improvements with proven experience.",

Should I focus on certifications to improve my chances? If so, which certifications are actually worth pursuing for someone at an entry level?

          "text": "The chances of you moving directly into a cybersecurity role are kinda slim. Most of the time you start in help desk for a decent sized MSP and start learning how companies use computers, software, and networks to accomplish their task. Once you learn the industry standard for software/setups etc. then you will see how bad actors exploit them. Active Directory, Office 365, Azure are all common systems used by companies to function. Learning how these systems are administrated and then eventually how they are exploited is your “phase 2” stage. Eventually you will start helping out with security related tickets and hopefully move into a security only role.\n\nThis is gonna be hard to hear, but colleges have been selling lies since cybersecurity became the next big thing. They make it seem like all you need is a degree with homelab experience and your set. This is simply not true. Companies are not going to hire you into a cybersecurity role with little or no hands on IT experience. They want experience supporting businesses with their IT infrastructure because that’s how you actually learn the trade. Cybersecurity will always be something you grow into from a standard tech. You simply must have the hands on experience that comes from doing standard business support. \n\nIn short, college isn’t helping you skip the line. Start off in a help desk role and grown into a cybersecurity SME.\n\n\nI have no degrees, only 1 cert (CompTIA SecurityX) and I have been promoted to a security only role. I have been in IT since 2021 working on a help desk. I gradually become more and more security focused and was then labeled as a subject matter expert for Cybersecurity related tickets.",

Both of these conditions need to be true before you click. In your friend's case, the link came from a trusted source, but they were not expecting it.  I won't even click a link from a family member unless I have a heads up and some context of what they are sending. :)",

A completed degree gives you flexibility, as many of the skills you’ve learned, like networking, risk assessment, systems knowledge, and basic IT, are transferable to roles in IT management, project management, or general tech support. Even if you don’t go deep into security, having the degree can open doors in tech-adjacent fields and make your résumé more competitive.\n\nIf you’re truly not interested in cybersecurity, you could start exploring minors, certifications, or courses in areas that excite you, like IT, cloud, data analysis, or project management, while finishing the degree. That way, you get the credential without closing other doors.\n\nFor advice on bridging your degree to practical skills and career-ready experience, check out SecPro Academy.",

It’s not a deep technical cert.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean it has no value.\n\nCEH is a broad, structured overview of offensive concepts - attack phases, tooling categories, methodology, vulnerabilities, etc. For someone early in their career, especially without years of real-world exposure, that structured coverage can help connect dots across networking, web, malware, and defensive mechanisms.\n\nIt’s also still widely recognized globally. In some regions (including parts of Asia and government sectors), it carries weight. EC-Council has also updated CEH in recent years to align more with modern attack frameworks and MITRE ATT&CK mapping, so it’s not stuck in 2012 like some comments suggest.\n\nCEH won’t make you a SOC analyst. It gives you attacker perspective.",

The **vast** majority of files on my computer are non-sensitive, so I do not want to encrypt the whole drive.\n\nFor the handful of files that should be kept secure, I would like to encrypt and lock them behind a password while retaining the ability to easily edit them when needed.\n\nOn my old Mac, I had a \"sparesimage\" where I could store sensitive files.  In the file browser, it showed as a single file.  I'd click it, it would prompt me for a password, and after entering the password it would mount as an \"external\" drive.  When I was done working with the files on the virtual drive, I would simply \"eject\" it and everything was locked behind the password again.\n\nThis was super handy, but I've moved on from macOS.  I'm currently using Windows 10, but will likely be switching over to Linux toward the end of the year when extended security support for Windows 10 ends.\n\nI looked for a similar feature to the sparesimage from macOS, but I'm not finding an equivalent in Windows 10.  Best I could find was encrypted folders, which don't seem to behave the way I want.  I can't seem to leave access to the folder perpetually locked behind a password.\n\nWhat would be the correct way to achieve my desired goal here?
