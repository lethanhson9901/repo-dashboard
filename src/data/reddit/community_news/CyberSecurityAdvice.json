      "text": "Hey everyone,\nWith cyber threats getting faster and more automated a lot of people throw around Security Operating Center but not everyone knows what one really does day-to-day.\nIn simple terms, a Security Operations Center (SOC) is the team + tools that watch an organization’s environment 24/7 to spot, understand and stop attacks before (or while) they cause damage.\n\nTypical things happening inside:\n\nReal-time monitoring of logs, endpoints, networks, cloud, email, etc.\nAlert triage (sorting thousands of alerts down to real threats)\nThreat hunting (actively looking for hidden attackers)\nIncident response (containing & remediating when something bad is confirmed)\nUsing SIEM, EDR, SOAR, threat intel feeds, and increasingly AI/ML for detection\nReporting & compliance hand-off (for audits, executives, legal)\n\nIt’s basically the “security nerve center” reactive on alerts and proactive on hunting.\n\nWhat surprised you most about how a SOC actually runs?",

Most advanced threat detections (ML, UEBA, Ai, etc) are False Positives.\n3. Most of the useful detections are still written by hand in their respective query languages (KQL, SPL, etc).\n4. Most SOC analysts are so alert fatigued they couldn’t tell you what they worked on that day.\n5. Of ALL the cool new cyber platforms and tools, excel is still the most used.",

              "text": "The things you're calling out here are indicative of a set of tools and solutions in the company's cybersecurity stack that not properly integrated together. Proper integration across a cybersecurity stack can be difficult, to say the least. Understand that \"advanced threat detections\" within a siloed solution area are often not \"false positives\" but rather events that happened that are termed to be an \"alert\" - that event happened but it's just not necessarily a threat or something a practitioner cares about. The detections that are written by hand are often correlating between these siloed solution areas bringing higher fidelity to those alerts. In other words, three or four alerts together make a positive/positive but any one of them by themselves is just an event. Creating these types of correlated alerts can be difficult with a set of siloed tools that are generating AI/ML detections that don't have the details within those findings that enable effective correlations and conditional alerts. I would also call out that Deep Learning is often overlooked to broaden the scope of detection beyond structured data and LLMs. It is a heavy lift to get those advanced threat detection mechanisms working together to best understand their context across the various solution areas. A mature SOC has solved these issues. What you're describing here is a SOC that has all the pieces of the puzzle but haven't put them together to see the complete picture.",

I was thinking about considering cert after cert ( not buying them for now ) and study their content like those listed in the image, \n\nmy question is should i continue in web security and go for bug bounty to affoard their certs exams and at the same while study for a specific cert path like ejptv2 or choosing one thing to do beside my college study ? and sorry for the verbosity.\n\nTarget: penetration testing and bug bounty for now ",

Focus on mastering one lane instead of chasing multiple certificates at once, and let certs validate skills you already built.

A few years ago, the big pain point was just basic vulnerability scanning. Now, attackers are using AI to find zero-days or create incredibly sophisticated social engineering attacks that are almost impossible to catch with traditional signatures.\n\nFor us, it meant our CNAPP stack had to evolve. We went from just looking at code and misconfigurations to needing real-time runtime protection that can identify AI-driven anomalies. For instance, we had a situation where an LLM in a development pipeline started exhibiting strange data access patterns, which turned out to be an attempt to exfiltrate training data. Tools like AccuKnox ([accuknox.com](https://www.linkedin.com/safety/go?url=https%3A%2F%2Faccuknox.com%2F&trk=flagship-messaging-web&messageThreadUrn=urn%3Ali%3AmessagingThread%3A2-OGQ4YjQzNjktZTQ3MC00Yjg3LTgyNTItMzdmMjcxZDczZDlmXzEwMA%3D%3D)) alongside our platform, helped us correlate that with behavioral anomalies that AI in the attack chain was triggering.\n\nThe short version is, if you're not thinking about how AI impacts both offense and defense in your daily work, you'll be playing catch-up. It’s about understanding the new attack surfaces AI creates and how defensive AI tools can help manage the noise.",

When joiner/leaver automation, conditional access, and Windows login MFA are aligned, support tickets drop significantly.\n\nThe biggest problems usually don’t come from MFA itself. They come from legacy auth still hanging around in the environment.",

I get the general concept: instead of personally tracking down every random site that has scraped your info and going through dozens of different opt‑out pages, you hand the job over to a service that automates the removal requests and keeps monitoring for new listings. On paper, that sounds great, especially if your name shows up all over the place or you just don’t have the time or patience to keep doing it manually.\n\nAt the same time, I’m still pretty conflicted. Part of me really likes the idea of having something in the background constantly checking for new data broker listings and sending removal requests without me needing to think about it. But another part of me feels uneasy about giving yet another company access to my personal details in order to “protect” my privacy. There’s also the question of how much they can realistically remove, how quickly, and whether everything just pops back up again later.\n\nSo for anyone who has actually used OneRep or a similar privacy/removal service for a while, I’d love to hear how it felt in practice. Did it make a noticeable difference to how often you find your info on people‑search sites? Did it feel like a meaningful long‑term privacy improvement, or more like paying a subscription for convenience—something you could more or less replicate on your own if you were disciplined enough to stick with manual opt‑outs and periodic checks?",

You’re already thinking like a hunter (business logic, auth flows), that’s rare. Don’t abandon it.\nRE/Malware is a passion field. Smaller market, steeper curve, lower early pay. But if you’re genuinely curious about how things break at a low level, not just that they break, it compounds hard over time. The people who do it for money usually quit. The ones who do it because they can’t stop thinking about it become irreplaceable.\nMy honest take: keep PT as your income engine, start RE on the side. Reverse one malware sample a week. No course, just a sample and a debugger. In 6 months you’ll know if it’s actually for you, or if you were just attracted to the aesthetic.\nTwo skills that overlap is a moat.

When you purchase your DOCSIS modem id advise you to spend the money (roughly $400) and install an enterprise grade router which will allow you to segment your network, (separate IoT devices from sensitive personal devices). Enterprise routers also can have IDS/IPS already installed which will give you a much higher degree of control over what traffic is allowed in or out of your network.  Good luck.",

Insert the drive into your PC and use the AV to scan the drive. \n\nThe more likely thing you experienced was at the account level. In that case, make sure you are using unique and randomly generated passwords for every account. Use a password manager like BitWarden or 1Password to help create and manage these.  Also, use 2FA on every account that offers it. \n\nNever use any cracked/pirated software or games. \n\nFollowing these should keep you safe from someone entering your accounts.",

Looked up five of the numbers.\nThey're all VoIP numbers registered to the same telecom provider. None of them are in my state (area codes are all over the place). And several are flagged as scam numbers by other users.\nApparently this is a thing called a \"one ring scam.\" They want you to call back, which connects you to a premium rate number that charges you insane fees per minute. Some people reported bills over $100 from a single callback.\nI've blocked them all now but new ones keep calling.\nHas anyone dealt with this? Is there a way to block all VoIP calls or something?

I have checked multple sources and it is one owned by a \"regional\"/very local ISP.\n\nI also have HubSpot Buyer Intent enabled on the website. Interestingly enough a business shows up for these entries. More specifically an IT/CyberSecurity Business.\n\nWhen I google the business, it has 1 employee, and that business lies right smack dab in the middle of the geographic area of the ISP's coverage. The business is a little difficult to find, but has a YouTube channel, where said person identifies themselves.\n\nFrom my end I have blocked and unblocked the IP range on the CDN and Website side, when I unblock the hits persist.\n\nWhere my head is at is I am a bit annoyed, it took a few hours to figure this out and seems a bit amateurish in nature. I don't know this person from Adam other then they are in the IT industry and if they are doing this to my business, how many other businesses are they doing this to?\n\nAm I within my right to file an IC3 and present the facts as they are?",
