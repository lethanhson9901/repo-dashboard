Get. A. Linkedin. Account!\n\nOpen ChatGPT, ask it the following:\n\n\"Please guide me through creating a resume by providing a framework that I can fill out that is suitable for a male 20 yo that is [insert some of your best qualities i.e. strong work ethic, mechanically minded, analytical, great with people etc]. \n\nI am looking to apply for jobs that are in the [insert industry]. I have the following skills/qualification [insert skills/quals].\n\nI have ever written a resume, so please give me a guide on best practice and the usual sections that will help me create a solid resume\"\n\nOnce it churns that out, follow the guide and then ask it the following:\n\n\"Please look at my resume attached/pasted below and give me guidance on how I can improve it.\"\n\nRinse, repeat the step before until your resume is awesome.\n\nAsk it to do the same with writing a Linkedin profile.\n\nNext prompt:\n\n\"You are a recruiter for a top recruitment firm that hires exceptional candidates for companies that require hard-working and smart young adults. Please look at my resume (attach or cut/paste it) and rewrite this for my Linkedin profile so that I stand out and I am a top candidate for those browsing Linkedin\"\n\nOnce it churns it out, ask the following:\n\"Please look at my Linkedin profile and rewrite it in any areas you feel are not showing me to be an exceptional candidate\"\n\nOnce it is done, attach an image to ChatGPT and ask the following:\n\n\"Please look at the image and convert it to a professional headshot that doesn't change my features or my over all face, but just ensure the lighting looks amazing and I look professional, in a suit and tie\"\nOnce that is done, post it to your Linkedin profile.\n\nNow let's look for jobs.\n\n\"I want you to find jobs in the [insert city/area] area that meet the following criteria:\n\n-Must have a salary posted >$xx,xxx  -does jot require a degree \n-hours \n-no/minimal/1yr experience required \n-has healthcare \n-in the [insert industry] industry \n-has whatever other criteria is important to you \n-been posted for less that 1week.\n\nPlease post the results in a table and include the following info if available:\n\n-link to job \n-salary \n-zip code \n-hours \n-industry \n-any other criteria\"\n\nThen post your resume and/or Linkedin to the jobs.\n\nIf it needs a cover letter.... back to ChatGPT:\n\n\"Please write a cover letter for the following job advert using my linkedin profile/attached resume.  Keep it short, easy to read and provide a camples of why I am a good candidate with examples to back it up\"\n\nRegarding jobs in Vegas\n\n-MGM is always hiring security guards but might have to be 21 yo.\n\n-All the casinos have jobs going, just search their jobs pages in Google. Bog casinos are MGM, Caesars, Station and Boyd Gaming.\n\n-Taskrabbit, Airtasker, NextDoor are all apps you can post to and say you are keen, hard working and what your hourly rate is.\n\n-Open Google maps, find an area and look at all the businesses. Click in them, open their website and email a resume to them. If they dont have an email address then send them a link to your Linkedin profile to their contact form.\n\n-Walk the streets. Get dressed up smart, clean shaven, brush your hair and go into businesses and ask if they are recruiting. Regardless, give them a physical copy of your resume. No printer, no problem. Download the Blinq app and add your details to there. Put your resume in a Google Drive/OneDrive and in your Blinq profile add the link to the cloud drive with your resume. DoNOT leave any place without them taking a physical or E-resume.\n\nBest of luck dude!\"",

Also, the dude that said get a LinkedIn is trippin. Statistically it has the highest number of ghost jobs, and all the real ones get scooped up as soon as they're posted. Use websites like BuiltIn or YCombinator jobs. I don't get a response on every single job that I apply to through those two, but I do get a response on between 25% and 50% of the positions I've applied to. I have never once had a response for any position that I was qualified for or even overqualified for through linkedin. LinkedIn is garbage and so is anyone that suggests that you use it. The moment that you started you will have to constantly be a shill and/or a ball licker for any company you've ever worked for because bad-mouthing them on LinkedIn is a sure way to never get a job again on LinkedIn. As is not posting frequently on LinkedIn. This is the problem with LinkedIn you have to treat it like a social media site and treat it like it's a job posting site and be super corporate PC never say anything wrong and every company you ever worked for was perfect and never had any issues. Don't get sucked into the LinkedIn hole bro.",

          "text": "I'm in my 50's and have been working in IT since around 1996. I use chatgpt and gemini, etc to help me write powershell scripts or to help me navigate a path through a problem I've never seen before. \n\nIt's way better than trying to depend on anonymous rando's on Internet forums who may give incorrect or incomplete advice,. and certainly most times are not willing to engage in a conversation for any long length of time. \n\nI was working in chatGPT last night and this morning (probably a total of about 4 hours) on a particular problem. It's nice to take a break (to go shower and sleep).. some ideas come to me in the middle of the night and in the morning I can just sit down at the keyboard and pickup right where we left off. \n\nAlso with chatgpt,. I find many times if I get stuck or I think a particular approach is not working as I hoped,. it's easy to just say \"Hey, this particular approach we're using, I'd like to set it aside for a moment and try a different idea. how about we do X process instead ?\".. and boom.. you're exploring a new solution-path. \n\nYou have to remember that chatgpt is just a tool. A tool can be used in different ways. It's not always about \"I expect the 100% perfect answer after 1st question\". Sometimes the conversation is a \"process of elimination\" (\"Hey, we've eliminated X and also eliminated Y,. so let's focus on Z\".. etc) \n\nI've found it super super helpful. \n\nI'm semi-familiar with Linux (have been fiddling with it also since the mid 90's) but nothing deep. I recently bought a Framework 13 Laptop (preconfigured with Windows) and was going to swap out the internal SSD and install Fedora. I started a conversation with ChatGPT asking it what recommendations it would have and etc.. it laid out a plan with a variety of options and recommendations and helped me along the way (how to partition the drive, certain drivers to install, certain ways to do certain things, etc.. I found it super helpful. \n\nThe one thing I can say.. LLM chatbots are not \"perfect\".. but often I find its my fault for not including complete context. I've found that instead of simply trying to describe things,. it's way better to just drop in a screenshot and let the LLM see the error. 9 times out of 10 this results in better analysis.",

Much of the administrative bloat we do is greatly reduced by *intelligent* usage of GenAI and it opens as many security concerns for us as anything else.\n\nAlso, while the current iteration of GenAI may be frustrating, AI/ML isn't a new field and folks weren't too vocal when big data / social media was micro analyzing them and knowing them better than their families.\n\nI suppose what I'm saying is that part of being in cybersecurity is learning not to worry with what you can't control and to have some context generative AI is yet another thing that you have minimal influence over so you might as well ride the wave to the best of your abilities otherwise you will be crashed by it and go nowhere.",

          "text": "The first thing to understand is that \"AI\" has existed by other names for a long time. You have most certainly already been using \"AI\" and not realized it, because it wasn't hyped up like that. There's... a lot of hype around \"AI' rn bc it's marketable. It'll pass.\n\nAs for Gen AI, which you specifically mentioned in your title- stuff like chatgpt is bad for a variety of moral/ethical/financial/legal reasons, like plagiarism, misuse of global resources, being a front for surveillance, inaccurate information, waste of time, etc. That said, there's types of GenAI that are trained on a small set of data for specialized reasons. They do not swallow massive amounts of energy and global resources. They are also not hyped up because they do not feed the global surveillance beast. They will probably exist in their very niche uses after the \"AI' hype train passes. Mid-2025 a lot of companies dropped their initial buy-in to the \"gen AI\" hype. My company's literal \"priorities and goals\" at the end of 2024 was \"more AI!!!\" and this year it's \"oh my god, can we get rid of this? it is causing more work for more money\". It's like when companies hire those \"consultants\" that feed them \"solutions to save money\" that they implement (at great cost) before walking it back. They literally disabled recording on MS Teams because it was the only way to turn off Teams AI \"meeting summaries\" because the \"summaries\" were the literal opposite of what happened in the meeting, and it was causing serious issues. They implemented some \"sentiment analysis\" thing for customer service and are now walking it back because it's throwing up red flags (I think from a legal/ privacy perspective?) They went from \"AI everything gen AI is efficiency!\" to spending massive amounts of resources to remind/ beg people to please not upload sensitive/confidential data into AI chatbots (including the \"corporate\" one) because that's a legal no-no.\n\nMy friend literally worked for a (niche) genAI company and initially swore up and down that \"in \\_\\_\\_ amount of time, all these things will be automated!\" and now admits that 80% of it is actually made up. It's a product they HOPE to produce, and they claim these things work in order to secure investors so they can actually attempt to build it, but the building isn't working. There is a LOT of money put into \"AI' that's gonna crash and burn. Which is why they're trying to convince consumers to buy-in, because they want regular people to put their money into it so the investors can pull some of their lost \"investments\" back out. As more people invest in, they're going to get fanatically desperate in their support. Kinda like a pyramid scheme! lol. It will be unpleasant but it will pass.\n\nIt's good to know how the current technology functions. Observe how other people use it. Learn how and where it fails (it fails a lot!) Learn how it's used for cybercrime and how to fight it. You do not have to actually use it yourself or anything you feel is unethical. I didn't implement any (gen AI) for work, don't have to use any myself, and now am the person helping set up security against them or decommissioning them. It will be fine.",

At work, especially in IT (maybe not if you're a coder). They just care you deliver results. We all already use Google, even the 10, 20, 30 year veteran, we still use Google, cause we don't know everything and we can't remember everything. AI is just a smarter Google.\n\nGuess what else will make you want to use AI? Performance reviews, weekly reports - other stupid paperwork that none of the IT professionals like to write - proposals, project plans, SOPs, every fluff to make management feel warm and fuzzy while doing none of the work.\n\nYou'll want to learn to use AI to do that. But you'll also want to learn how to actually do it yourself, so you can make sure the AI is doing it right and editing it. AI still teach me new ways to phrase things more politically, or reminds me of works and phrasing I've forgotten. But AI is also like a junior worker, you have to WATCH it, you have to review its work. In your case of being a newly grad, the AI is actually smarter than you because it has A LOT more training than you. Ask it if you're supposed to say something in such way that are you about to in an email. I bet sometimes it'll tell you you come across the wrong way (it's NOT always right though). But do write your email yourself, you can have it help you tweak a sentence or two if you're not sure.\n\nAnd guess what, almost nobody will care you use AI if you do the paperwork right that way, or write a doc correctly. You may not know this yet, but a lot of IT involves reading error logs to troubleshoot, sometimes if you're lucky this is only 5 lines, if you are NOT lucky, these can be hundreds and thousands of lines. Guess who reads faster than you and won't miss a single character mistake like you?\n\nLearn to use it, learn to love it for the things it can do for you. Even if bubble burst some day, it will still have some use. It's at worst a better phone assistant than what we had in previous generation. Yes you are getting a bubbled perspective. It's a tool, the world is moving. It's here to stay in some form or another. Get over it. Really, it's better that you do, in THIS career.\n\nIf you work in anything else I can't say I'd give the same advice. I don't have the relevant data.\n\nEdit: didn't notice which subreddit I'm in.

The state of the art in academia and industry shows that wholly client side message inspection like naive CSS can create privacy harms rather than solve abuse. Metadata and user flagging capture a lot of problematic content without breaking E2EE guarantees. The more scalable realistic route is to build layered defense. This includes upstream user signals, downstream moderation workflows, external threat intelligence, and behavioral analytics, not unlocking every message. Tools like ActiveFence follow that layered philosophy. They aggregate contextual intelligence, pattern detection, and risk scoring across signals you can inspect without direct decryption. This does not solve the paradox but reframes it. You accept imperfect detection in exchange for preserving privacy guarantees activists care about and then mitigate risk through smarter non plaintext dependent methods.",

If what you are seeking is anonymity, that can nearly always be backtracked.\n\nHow are you acquiring your phone and SIM card to avoid records?  How are you paying for your data plan?  How are you paying for your VPN?  \n\nThere is a pretty good book, The Art of Invisibility, written by Kevin Mitnick, that outlines steps and best practices for decreasing your digital footprint and keeping yourself more secure…but be aware that 1.  Many VPNs, regardless of their stated retention policies, will comply with court orders, even if that means data retention only after they’ve received the order.  2.  There are cameras and records of things everywhere.  3.  Many countries will require some sort of identity verification to activate a SIM.\n\nSo, just imagining a scenario…you buy a SIM, your equipment now has an IMEI and IMSI.  That IMEI will be associated with your IMSI from the service provider.  Chances are pretty good that the store you bought that SIM from has some sort of surveillance/security cameras, so now footage of you exists making that purchase.  You sign up for a commercial VPN, everything seems good, you do something stupid and break the law…in a big time way…now that VPN gets a record retention request that is valid in the country they operate out of…if they comply, the IP address you connected to the VPN through as well as your activity logs are turned over to law enforcement.  With that IP address, the cell phone carrier is requested to turn over any user data including ID verification data, tower registration data, and your IMEI.   A watch is put out in areas where your device frequently registers, and you’re trying to enjoy a bowl of cereal when you notice your cell phone getting a little warm and a really strong signal, and before you know it, some guy holding a device that mimics a cell tower is honing in on your position.\n\nClosing your browser/locking your phone may delete the data from the device, but they’ve got the data from the VPN, they’ve correlated your pre-paid data plan burn rate with the activity from the VPN, they’ve got the device and SIM, and have the video of you purchasing the SIM in the first place.  You’re cooked.\n\nSo, privacy, yes…anonymity…no.  Don’t break the law.",

Someone is entering your email into public support/contact forms (especially Zendesk-based ones), which triggers automatic acknowledgement emails from legitimate domains. Since no emails are being sent from your account and there are no login alerts, your email itself isn’t breached. Unfortunately there’s no universal way to stop people from typing your address into forms, but you can mitigate it by setting up inbox filters for common Zendesk headers or sender patterns, replying “wrong email / unsubscribe” on tickets (many systems stop notifications after that), and reporting the issue to Zendesk abuse/support so they can suppress it on their end.
