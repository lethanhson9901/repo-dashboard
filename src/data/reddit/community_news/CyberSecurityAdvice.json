      "text": "I don't want to be a downer, but so many people on here are starting their undergrad in Cyber or asking if they should go Cyber for their undergrad, after graduating high school.\n\n* People with an undergrad degree in Cyber in 2018 - roughly 14,500\n* People with an undergrad degree in Cyber in 2026 - roughly 35,000\n\nThat's a more than 2.5x rise in degree Cybersecurity degree holders.  Do yourself a favor before choosing this major/degree, look up the # of people who have jobs in it after graduating.  You're now dealing with 2.5x the competition from Cyber degree holders alone.  This isn't counting all the laid of seasoned veterans.  10,000+ lay offs and counting.  \n\n* Global CompTIA Sec+ holders in 2019 - roughly 500,000\n* Global CompTIA Sec+ holders in 2026 - roughly 1,000,000\n\nIs it fair?  No.  Is it the reality?  Yes.  Here's what you're up against.  Doubling of degree holders in cyber and Sec+ holders.  Roughly 204,000 laid of tech workers in major companies and FAANG - Source [https://www.trueup.io/layoffs](https://www.trueup.io/layoffs) \\- IG/Tiktok course seller graduates.  AI and a 75% surge in offshoring/outsourcing to India jobs that used to be entry level Cyber jobs for Americans.  Think Associate/Jr Cyber Analysts, SOC Analysts, Associate Cyber Engineers.  Please stop making these Vendors of courses rich.  Stop making these universities rich.  Stop making these bootcamps rich...  they're the ones making all the money.  While a lot of people in the 204,000 private sector (not even counting gov contracting/gov layoffs) are laid off seasoned Cyber vets.  That is your competition.\n\n  \nCyber is no longer the \"high job security.  high pay quick\" job field.  Exception - You're at a Senior or Principle level with a lot of experience.  Stop throwing away your money.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nIm currently helping a new friend of mine who has been dealing with a serious stalking/hacking situation for years now. I cant go into detail because I dont want the person seeing this and knowing whats up. \n\nI will just say that the person in question has a high level of skill and has been making my friends life a nightmare. From what I have seen and heard from my friend, I'm guessing its RATs & SIM swaps and/or persistent session tokens, as he is able to access, edit and delete files off her devices and also knows private things like her schedule and things she has said to other people via text etc, just to name a few things. My friend is not tech savvy at all so is really stuck and distressed by all this.\n\nI have checked her Windows 11 PC and she is definitely being compromised there. Again I dont wanna disclose exactly what, but it is quite advanced.\n\nI am not an expert in in cyber security, so I was hoping to get some input/critique from some of you more knowledgeable redditors :) \n\n**This is my current plan:**\n\n1. Completely wiping Windows. I’ve already created a bootable USB for Fedora Silverblue due to its immutable features.\n2. I was thinking of using a Fedora Live session to pull only her essential files (photos/docs) onto an external drive, specifically avoiding AppData, Program Files, and any .exe or .js files\n3. I have purchased a new modem for her, it is a TP Link Archer AX55, I chose it because of the Homeshield feature.\n4. I'll be doing all the obvious stuff, like fresh emails for all accounts, adding a password manager, locking down her home network including her security cameras, contacting her phone carrier to add a port out pin, education etc.\n\n**My Questions for the Community:**\n\n* Is Fedora Silverblue the right choice for someone who needs \"set and forget\" security? She really only uses the internet for shopping and browsing so she's not fussy and Fedora seems to have a user friendly interface.\n* Are there specific \"hardened\" settings in Fedora I should toggle?\n* She uses an iPhone and I'm shit with Apple products, so I'm not certain on what to do here other than change her Apple ID and doing an Emergency Reset i believe it's called. Is there anything I can add to her iPhone to harden it?\n* Do you think going back to using gmail/google is a shit idea? Or OK if everything else is tight? Otherwise Im guessing Protonmail is best?\n* Also just to note, she doesn't want to buy a Mac or change her phone to something else, as I did already suggest Graphene.\n\nI just want to make sure I’m giving her a fortress that she can actually use without being a tech expert. Any advice or feedback would be greatly appreciated! Please keep in mind I am not an expert in any way, so please be nice if I have said anything dumb! :) \n\nThank you everyone\n\n",

Using Proton/Bluemail to add another layer is a must. **2FA everything to the \\*NEW\\* phone.** Consider using the Tor browser.\n\nDisable location services. Scan for AirTags in the area.

There's really no reason to completely change OSes. \n\n* Keep all your stuff updated (OS updates, App updates, Browser updates, .. basically anything App or Browser or thing you use on a daily basis, .you should be keeping updated on a daily basis)\n\n* Don't click or run unknown shit. All your app installs etc should come from original official sources. Don't open unknown emails. Don't install unknown Apps. Don't respond to unknown SMS, etc etc. \n\n* Use a Password manager and make sure all your online accounts have good, long, strong, unique passwords along with MFA or Authenticator of some kind (or Yubikey or other hardware auth) \n\n> \"someone who needs \"set and forget\" security? \"\n\nThere's no such thing as \"set it and forget it\" security. Anytime a person is using a device (smartphone, computer, etc),.. good security practices should be first and foremost in the front of their mind. \"What am I clicking on ?\".. \"Why is the computer asking me to do something?\".. \"Was that behavior or outcome I just witnessed normal and expected?\" .. All of those types of questions need to be running through someone's mind while using a computer. (Computer and Device use needs to be a \"engaged activity\".) You can't just mindlessly or blindly use it and think \"it's going to protect me from anything unknown\".. because that's not how it works. \n\n> \"I will just say that the person in question has a high level of skill \"\n\nThis is largely irrelevant. Unless the person is like a 40year NSA employee or something,. the idea that they can easily or effortlessly \"hack someone's computer\" is not feasible or realistic. If you wipe a device and install clean version of Win11 or macOS or iOS,.. you're pretty well protected. Someone cannot just \"wave a magic Harry Potter wand\" and instantly or easily hack into your devices. Doesn't work like that.",

Do you like to deal with people? Do you prefer to sit infront of a computer investigating logs? Do you like coding? Do you like selling solutions? Do you prefer to do policies like GRC?   \n5) What career goal do you wish to work towards in the future (5-10 years)? Do you want to be a CISO? Do you want to be a Security Engineer/Architect? Do you want to be a researcher? Do you want to be a penetration tester? Do you want to be in Threat Intelligence? Do you want to be a manager for an operations team?  \n6) Where are you located? Is there a mature cybersecurity need within your state/country? Do you intend to move?\n\nSounds like you're most motivated with monetary value which is great - that's sort of where I got started. But without a clear goal for yourself, without doing proper homework, without considering your own strengths and wants, it's easy for you to get lost in Cybersecurity just because it's such a huge and diverse field. \n\nIt ranges from SOC analysts jobs to being a cybersecurity vendor where you're mostly sales and business but you still need cybersecurity knowledge. But both jobs are vastly different for the skillsets they require. \n\nEvery city has different pay grades as well. Even for a SOC analyst role can vary from MSSP types to lucrative 6 figure jobs following an around-the-sun model in an MNC. \n\nHaving a goal helps with the passion, and your suffering to get to that goal will have meaning. \n\nSo figure out that goal first.   \n  \nI have friends in cybersecurity who earn around USD$40k a year, while I could earn USD$80k in the same job title in different environments. Different industries pay different, different companies pay different. \n\nHope this insight helps. ",

You can definitely get certs and then go apply for entry level help desk roles. After spending some time in a help desk role (maybe 6 months - 1 or 2 years) it will be easier for you to get a cybersecurity job as you will have experience supporting industry standard software and systems.\n\nCertifications from CompTIA give you a broad view of the field and help you build foundational knowledge. After you get Network+ or Security+ I would suggest trying to get some Microsoft Azure certs since most companies use it or it’s sister softwares in some form. \n\n\nTo answer your original question, I make around 85,000 in Louisiana. I have been in IT since 2021 and worked my way up to a security only role in an MSP.\n\nIf you are going to college specifically for Cybersecurity, I want to advise you that most places would rather you have four years of experience working in the IT workforce then a bachelors degree in Cybersecurity. Don’t feel like you must go to college to get a career in cybersecurity. Certifications and experience reign supreme in this field.",

Because of the type of organizations that I work with, it's a much more involved process for the client where there are policy owners that are actually writing the bulk of the policy for their respective area.

Like your Employee handbook, acceptable use policy etc. Owners are generally HR, or legal with some IT. We aim for like 3 or 4 a quarter because everyone has stuff going on. \nYou can think of these as your baseline org policies \n\nSecond phase  of policies focus on IT standards  like your encryption policies, approved software policies etc. \n\nThird phase is programs. This would be DLP, security awareness, or vulnerability management. \n\n\nIt also helps if you make stuff modular. Each policy should be its own document so you can update individual policies as needed without getting approval from every owner. That way HR can update the handbook and publish updates and IT can update the password policy without needing to approve each other's. It also helps to have a policy that references the other policies where it makes sense. Like an information security policy could be your glossary. Each section has a quick summary of the policy with a reference to a second document with the full policy. This makes it easier for someone to look stuff up because they head to the parent document and can get an understanding of what's in the supporting documents. \n\nIt's also important to build a policy template early. A format that you will make everyone follow for standardizing information. All the way down to the font and language choices. Policies should always use a present and authoritative tone. Like the employees will do this now. You don't want to use words like they should do this. \n\n\nSorry about typos or odd phrasing.

      "text": "Hi, I am currently 16, turning into 17 in few months. From the last five or six months I have stepped my feet into IT while maintaining my academic result. I have learned the basics of Python including all the data types such as dictionary and set. I also did the course in a website and leaned most of the OOP and other basics like list compression and lambda. Along side that, I created many small projects such as passwords generator using random, web scraping with beautiful soup and simply guess the number website with flask. Recently I have started learning basics on Linux and basics in cybersecurity via tryhackme and YouTube (networkchuck). I learned Betsy basics command such as cs pwd find etc.\n\nI got GCSE in a few months so can’t spend too much time in IT before June. However once GCSE ended I will spend most of my summer holiday in IT stuff. For example I am thinking of buying pi 5 and take the security + in the summer holiday.\n\nI am very hardworking, I can work around 7 hours on weekend and around 1.5 hours on weekdays. I am serious about getting a high paying job.\n\nI would like some advice on whether cybersecurity will be the best path for me since AI is evolving and I know that most cybersecurity requires lots of work experience which I will not have. The thing I care about most is salary and job availability. You could also recommend other IT path that might not be big now but will excel in the future (around 7 years later)\n\nAny recommendations will be very helpful to me❤️ pls leave a comment whether it is recommendation or criticism.",

And echo what's said on this sub a hundred times before.\n\nCyber security roles, are not entry level. Every man/woman I work with on my teams are 34 or older in the technical roles at least.\n\nIf you want to go down the technical path, if you can get a job working at a tech/repair shop. But, your issue is your age. At 15/16/17 you know nothing that's of use to some one who's been working in a general it position for 5 years. You are especially not of interest to any one within a cyber security field.\n\nNow, nothing is stopping you from doing stuff at home. But a job at Tesco stacking shelves will help you pay for hardware off eBay that you can start learning with. \n\nGo to college, maybe Uni. Every one wants the \"high paying\" security jobs.\n\nThose high paying jobs go to people who have 20/30 years of experience in relevent fields.\n\nNot to 16 year olds, or even 21 year olds out of uni. But to people who know the ins and outs of their areas of responsibility who have the experience in large enterprise scale deployments.\n\nIf you want it enough, you can get it. But it won't be in the summer of 26. And it won't be in the summer of 2030. But it doesn't mean you cant get there eventually.",

Because of that, I was also considering other IT paths like networking or IT support as stepping stones into cybersecurity.\n\nHowever, the offer I currently have is for a Data Analyst role.\n\nI’ve been consistently studying cybersecurity, networking, and operating systems in my free time. The challenge is that I don’t have formal work experience yet — I’ve mainly been applying to junior/fresh grad security analyst roles and internships, but haven’t landed one.\n\nSo I wanted to ask:\n\n* Should I take the Data Analyst role?\n* Can this realistically help me transition into a SOC Analyst position later?\n* Has anyone here made a similar move?\n\nI don’t want to drift too far away from cybersecurity, but I also don’t want to stay unemployed waiting for the “perfect” opportunity.\n\nWould really appreciate your insights.",

A hotspot doesn't give any access to your phone, it just acts like a router to send traffic from your hotspot Wi-Fi out through you mobile/cellular Internet connection.",

Multiple that by the annual growth rate. That gives you a rough estimate on the number of net-new positions created annually for all things cybersecurity. Yes, there will be some variability as no one can accurately foretell the future.\n\nLook at the number of Bachelors (\\~100K+) and Masters (\\~50K+) degrees in related fields being awarded annually in the USA. This gives you an idea of the net-new supply of \"formal education\" candidates being added every single year.\n\nLook at the number of folks pursuing certifications to break into the field. Look at the numbers for CompTIA trifecta (A+, Net+, Sec+). Look at the number of users training services such as THM (\\~6 million) and HTB (\\~4 million) have; they are popular for a reason. This gives you an even better idea of the volume of potential candidates trying to get in. The THM and HTB users will be international so take a look at the global cybersecurity workforce size (\\~5.5 million) for comparison. Ask yourself how realistic is it that basically the entire global cybersecurity workforce is using just these two services or is there a lot of folks hoping this will get them a job?\n\nCompare the numbers and make your own assessment. At least your eyes will be open going forward.\n\n\\---\n\nBe careful chasing dreams based upon headlines and folks selling gold rush dreams.\n\nLook at green energy and the headlines about it being a key job growth driver for the USA. Wind turbine maintenance is the highest growing job in the USA with about 5% annual growth (50% over 10 years). Sounds great but that is only 680 net-new jobs per year. Solar installation techs are the second highest with 4.2% annual growth rate (42% over 10 years) which is only 1201 net-new jobs per year in the USA. Those numbers do not align with what was pimped. Will see how accurate these hold up as taxpayer money dries up.\n\nNurse practitioner is about 3.5% annual growth (35% over 10 years) and that is about 13.3K net new jobs per year in the USA.\n\nHome health aide is about 1.7% annual growth (17% over 10 years) and that is about 74K net-new jobs per year.

Instead, you should look at the quality of the school as a thing to leverage into an internship over the summer (or while studying) to 1) gain job experience and 2) get past a lot of roadblocks in the hiring process. If you truly want to be successful, you will have to hustle your butt off in college with networking to land a role after graduation. Even if you are in an internship there is less likelihood (than in the past) there will be a full time role available for you, but you have much greater odds of being hired where you were an intern.\n\nI would second another that if you really want to pursue cybersecurity, a computer science or IT degree focused on the technical stuff would likely be more helpful for a junior role. Unfortunately, a lot of cyber degrees don't have the time to get super deep in how systems function. And the rest of the policy development and strategy stuff, PARTICULARLY at the junior level, is seen as replaceable by AI.\n\nThe thing the other technical degrees will teach you is the debugging and technical investigation thought process, which is more useful than the content.

Assuming I can get the necessary certs within the first 1-2 years, an entry level job in IT Sec, which of course depends on their job market. Plus whatever projects I do with Home labs or otherwise. Doesn't exactly help me stand out from the millions of other applicants it looks like, and i'm not sure what else I could add on to stand out other than Networking.\n\nAlternatively, I can pursue a Criminal Justice degree with emphasis in psychology. I remembered that my training at AIT was transferable to a community college and that upon transferring my transcripts to them, I'd get an AAS in Intelligence Studies on top of the courses I'd be taking for my BA. If I pursue Intel at entry level or get taken on by a company that would sponsor me to renew my clearance, then increase my experience in that area, plus learn Cybersecurity on my own via self-learning methods and courses - this may be the better and most versatile way to get into CTI down the road, it sounds like.\n\nProblem is, I'd be putting myself in a box again. I have a medical condition with my eyes that may disqualify me for positions within the FBI or more field work in law enforcement, so I'd have to take an analyst approach, and i'm not quite sure on the job market in that field that isn't government.\n\nEither way, I'm not realistically looking to enter the field for 5-6 years minimum at this rate. \n\nAlso I appreciate your insight.

      "text": "I believe this is the correct subreddit for my question (if not, feel free to correct me).\n\nLooking for a convenient way to protect files on my computer that have sensitive personal information.  The **vast** majority of files on my computer are non-sensitive, so I do not want to encrypt the whole drive.\n\nFor the handful of files that should be kept secure, I would like to encrypt and lock them behind a password while retaining the ability to easily edit them when needed.\n\nOn my old Mac, I had a \"sparesimage\" where I could store sensitive files.  In the file browser, it showed as a single file.  I'd click it, it would prompt me for a password, and after entering the password it would mount as an \"external\" drive.  When I was done working with the files on the virtual drive, I would simply \"eject\" it and everything was locked behind the password again.\n\nThis was super handy, but I've moved on from macOS.  I'm currently using Windows 10, but will likely be switching over to Linux toward the end of the year when extended security support for Windows 10 ends.\n\nI looked for a similar feature to the sparesimage from macOS, but I'm not finding an equivalent in Windows 10.  Best I could find was encrypted folders, which don't seem to behave the way I want.  I can't seem to leave access to the folder perpetually locked behind a password.\n\nWhat would be the correct way to achieve my desired goal here?  Ideally it would be something that works on Windows AND Linux (and ideally natively with no extra software needed).",

Only computers running the agent with your encryption key will be able to open the files, so someone can copy your private files to a thumb drive and they are useless in another computer.  ",

I got some exposure to reviewing technical controls, applying CIS benchmarks, and mapping threats to business processes and assets.\n\nOn the side, I've been building:\n\nA real-time network monitoring tool that detects things like DDoS attacks and port scans, uses OSINT for threat intel, and sends out email alerts.\n\nA personal project called ThreatBlueprint - an automated threat modeling tool built with React, TypeScript, and Supabase. It uses STRIDE and MITRE ATT&CK to help security teams model and assess risks.\n\nI've also been studying AWS security - mostly IAM, VPCs, NACLs,, Direct Connect, and focusing on identity, encryption, and network-level security.\n\nMy offer is decent for a fresher in India (CTC is on the higher end for an entry-level role), so I really want to make the most of this opportunity and build strong technical depth early on.\n\nThat said, I'm not entirely sure where to focus next - should I dive deeper into cloud security, red teaming/offensive security, or continue building on threat modeling and architecture?\n\nWould love to hear what paths worked for others in their early career, and any certs, resources, or tips you'd recommend.\n\nThanks in advance!",
