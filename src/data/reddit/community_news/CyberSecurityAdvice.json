Most of my coworkers and friends in IT did not go to college or still needed an internship or entry level job to get into IT.\n\nCollege teaches you a lot of technical stuff, but it really doesn't show the real-world aspect. Our teammates that didn't work in HelpDesk or another IT field before getting to Security Analyst struggle to know what a legitimate issue is and what'sa false positive; and they often rely on our Sysadmin team to explain it and explain why it's not a risk.\n\nPersonally, I think telling everyone they need college is BS, but I get that there are IT jobs out there that need it, such as developers, cybersecurity, etc. But they also still need the real world experience.\n\nIt's the same for someone getting a business degree and expecting to just immediately be hired as a manager with no experience. While it's possible and it does happen, not as often and it shouldn't. Managers with no experience are some of the worst, most out of touch managers. CIO's with no IT experience are terrible at their job. It is a different skillset than a sysadmin, but the experience makes a big difference.",

I’m not saying they need to stay in Helpdesk forever, because yes it sucks, but it’s a good place to start with absolutely no experience. You can go in many different ways from Helpdesk.",

Like just about every IT specialty at one point it was a small enough domain that it wasn't a specialty. If the sum of the security field is logging onto a unix box and configuring a firewall, then unix admins just configure the firewall. \n\nAs the domain got more and more advanced the required skills got wider and wider. At a non-exact point it became difficult to possess both the skillset needed to be an expert in cyber security and another domain. \n\nPeople don't get into specialties, they become someone who works in specialties as they learn and specialize. \n\nIt's similar to executives, very few people start off as executives. They gain knowledge in a domain that leads to gaining skills relevant to executives, Eventually their skillset matches to expectations and they move across the line to a title more aligned with \"Executive.\"",

These aren’t sexy but they unlock internships.\n* Year 2–3: pivot toward sysadmin, cloud, networking, or IAM-adjacent internships. That’s already “security adjacent” even if the title isn’t.\n* Certs here: Security+, maybe AWS/Azure fundamentals. Now your resume stops getting auto-rejected.\n* Year 3–5: target SOC intern, junior risk analyst, cloud support, IAM analyst roles. Do labs, home projects, writeups. This is where security becomes real.\n* Certs to promote later: CySA+, SSCP, cloud security specialty (not all at once).\n\nPeople get stuck because they wait until graduation to “start cybersecurity”. Don’t. You bake security into every IT role you touch.\n\nCyber isn’t entry level, but the path into it absolutely is if you start early and label your experience right.",

There's different places to start. \n\nLet me tell you something that will help you out, and let you know the road is not impossible although it may be long and hard to take the first step: \nThe amount of idiots who \"worked their way up\" to cybersecurity and lack any actual critical thinking or cybersecurity knowledge is ridiculous. It might not be the majority, but I have met way too many that it makes me worried for the future of the field. I have met way too many who knows how something works, and can configure security configurations. But actually working with budgets? Writing comprehensive risk and vulnerability assessments? Communicating complex technical terms to non-technical people? Investigating data breaches or security incidents? Way too many of them fall short. They will literally parrot terms without knowing how they actually apply and go through the motions, but that's it. If brain dead mouth breathers can do it, anyone can. \n\nBut, if you want to be great, here is my advice: Don't just know what you are doing, know WHY you are doing it. Knowing how something works is important, yes, but taking it that step further will help you in the long run. Also, personal projects. They help you learn and can look good on resumes. Always ask questions if you have them. Network, network, network. And I mean people. Reach out to people in the industry for knowledge and advice. And (super important) DEVELOP PEOPLE SKILLS. If you are still in school or just starting out, these are things you can do.",

The market right now is shit though and over saturated. OP has ZERO experience. He is applying to jobs with at least 100 other applicants who do have experience so helpdesk is the best bet right now.

I don't know what you studied in depth, and I can't say it is not possible, but usually people start in those positions.\n\nSo maybe it's worth looking for those roles, and while you look, having some certifications will be a differentiator for yourself over the other candidates but in the end, the experience will come in handy more than you think. If you are able to work in a medium-big company you can steadly grown there, like it was for me, but also a small business will allow you to grow in a different way, like you will mostly have a lot of experience in many areas, you will have to be technical support, sysadmin, Network guy, the \"security guy\" and etc, but it comes with a lot of experience in many areas.\n\nIn the end, try to start somewhere, once you are working, it will be easier to find for best positions as you grow.",

Move onto Network +.  Hopefully you local library system (in Texas anyone can get a HPL card) and get access to LinkedIn Learning and Udemy Business for free.\n\nAgain just study Network +.  If you have the money take the exam.  Still you can skip the exams and study for the CCNA.  That will cover all the Network basics.  Then maybe study.  \n\nLook at the local CC as well.  You could possibly dual credit some courses.  Finally go to partners.wgu.edu.  Go to partners.wgu.edu.  Click your state and see if the school is listed.  If it is see what degree you can get that transfers into the WGU degree.  CCNA gives you 11 credits towards the Cybersecurity and the BSIT.  Personally I would recommend the BSIT as you can transfer in more.  As you get the higher Comptia certs you can get your MSCIA at WGU.",

You think you do because you have no clue what cybersecurity really is, but you hear it's cool like the movies, you get to play with advanced gadgets, and it pays a ton of money.\n\nThe reality is, the pay sucks for 80% of people compared to other specialties, you're basically blindly reading through log files / text files all day, or running mundane pointless reports and audits.   \n\nCyberSecurity requires 5-10 years minimum experience in a ton of different IT areas to be truly good and excel, and colleges are handing out degrees like popcorn.\n\nSo if you try to pursue cyber instead of a regular more balanced IT degree, you're going to struggle to find a job for months at a time.  Once you do get a job you're going to be miserable and hate it, and you're going to be making $20 an hour for the first few years with small pay raises and a low chance of moving up and advancing your career.  \n\nStick with general IT or CS.  Learn Linux, learn AD, networking, understand in general how databases work, and go into IT with an open mind.   Think of it like getting icecream.  If you've never had any flavor ice cream before, why would you fixate on only trying vanilla, when there's 80 different flavors you should give a chance to?",

Like does a Windows Defender/Play Protect scan do the job? Checking browser dowwnloads/file downloads? Like at what point is when ur doing too much and being paranoid.

Someone is entering your email into public support/contact forms (especially Zendesk-based ones), which triggers automatic acknowledgement emails from legitimate domains. Since no emails are being sent from your account and there are no login alerts, your email itself isn’t breached. Unfortunately there’s no universal way to stop people from typing your address into forms, but you can mitigate it by setting up inbox filters for common Zendesk headers or sender patterns, replying “wrong email / unsubscribe” on tickets (many systems stop notifications after that), and reporting the issue to Zendesk abuse/support so they can suppress it on their end. Annoying, but generally harmless unless you start seeing actual login attempts or password reset emails.",

          "text": "The safest way to pay with PayPal on a Samsung Android phone is to use PayPal’s app with a virtual or tokenized payment method, so your real debit card is never shared with the merchant. Ideally, link a virtual card (PayPal Key if available, or a bank-issued virtual debit card) to your PayPal wallet and pay only through the official PayPal checkout. Merchants see only a PayPal token, not your card details, and you’re covered by PayPal’s fraud protection, at least for what they say. Enable 2FA, use biometric phone lock, and avoid entering card details directly on merchant sites to minimize risk.",
