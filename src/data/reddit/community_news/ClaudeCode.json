At this point, they're doing it in a legal way (scanning and destruction of the book). The real concern at this point is the difference of environment that the AI is contained in. American models have plenty of issues surrounding them. One of the main ones is safety.\n\n\nIdk about you, but safety isnt the first thing that comes to mind when I think of China. Maybe thats me just watching one too many Liveleak videos. The other issue is government. Yes, the American models/labs have their own problems with that, but I see the US as the lesser of two evils (Ill be honest in saying its not by a wide margin).\n\n\nAGI/ASI will eventually fix these problems one way or another (e.g. its not a problem if you no longer exist), but the bridge between now and then may be the most precarious position humanity will ever be in. Racing the CCP on AI development is not something we should want to do while crossing that bridge.\n\n\nIf AI development was devoid of government influence and everyone had the same or better safety standards? Id say the more the merrier. \n\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk...",

          "text": "What if AI labs built ONE incredible model together? CERN for AI 🌳  \nThe Anthropic distillation drama got me thinking — 24,000 fake accounts exist because knowledge naturally wants to flow between models. What if we stopped building walls and built rivers instead? Right now \\~$30-50B is spent across 10+ labs training models that do \\~85-90% the same tasks. Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok, Qwen, DeepSeek — they're all reinventing the same bicycle separately 🚲 **The proposal:** Labs jointly train ONE shared foundation model (the expensive part), then each fine-tunes their own version for safety, personality, and specialization. **Why it works:**\n\n* Like CERN — shared accelerator, competing research teams, diverse discoveries\n* Like Android — Google builds the OS, Samsung/Xiaomi customize\n* DeepSeek proved breakthroughs come from clever IDEAS, not just more compute. A shared base frees resources for more experimentation, not less **Addressing the monopoly concern:** One big unified dream team + one independent challenger team. Built-in healthy rivalry without 10x redundancy. **The math:** Pooled compute could produce a model \\~40-60% more powerful than any current individual model. That gap could matter for AGI timelines. Distillation isn't really \"stealing\" — the original stays with the creator. It's multiplying and even improving knowledge. So why not do it openly? Cooperation > secret distillation. What do you think?\n\n",

Discouraging brittle tests means it will prefer to use more flexible definitions like “COUNTA(category_label)” instead. \n\nIt’s no magic cure, but it helps a _lot_.

I was doing this all through happy on my phone from an airport while waiting for a 4 hour delay so I haven't actually looked at the code myself or tried running it yet, but it was calling out things to improve and stabilize, with possible bugs it patched and all the best practices and reviewing the 700 test cases across the project and adding a couple more where it thought some edge cases might be.

      "text": "About three weeks ago, a CEO of a well known tech company posted a public challenge on X. Solve all 30 browser navigation challenges on his website in under 5 minutes using an AI agent, and he'd offer $500k/year cash + equity to join his team. Open to anyone. Use any tools. Email the submission.\n\nI'm self taught. No CS degree, no PhD, no professional software engineering experience. I learned browser automation inside-out specifically for this challenge, built a general purpose browser agent in about 35 dev hours, and completed all 30 stages in 3 minutes 44 seconds.\n\nNot a script. No overfit prompts to his specific challenges. A general purpose agent that I also ran on a completely different set of browser challenges to prove it generalizes. Cost per run was about $2. I still use it daily for my normal work because it outperforms anything else available right now.\n\n[I even found out it was capable of security legitimate security audits.](https://x.com/brianbellx/status/2024132949671584252?s=20) (before Claude Code Security was released) And when I pointed it at my own apps, it found and exploited real vulnerabilities. That was never part of the design, the agent just figured it out with the tools it had already.\n\nI emailed him everything. Videos of both runs, full codebase, repro instructions, run stats. [He responded publicly on X saying \"we will take a look\"](https://x.com/adcock_brett/status/2021806606498034069?s=20) but never replied to the email. I sent a follow-up after a few days. Nothing. Sent a third follow-up today after a full week of silence. Still nothing.\n\n[Meanwhile I posted about it on X and it went semi-viral (\\~100K impressions off a small account).](https://x.com/brianbellx/status/2021076906276262353?s=20) Got DMs from people at major AI companies, a journalist, and today a YC-backed CEO reached out about a role after I topped their leaderboard with the same agent. So there's been interest from other directions, but the one door I actually built this for hasn't opened.\n\nI don't know if his team is reviewing it and he just hasn't looped back, if he got flooded with submissions, or if the challenge was more of a marketing stunt than a real offer.\n\nI'm not trying to be entitled about it. I know CEOs are busy and I'm probably one of many who submitted. But I put real work into this and met the publicly stated criteria. At what point do you move on? And is there anything else I should be doing here?\n\nI'm not sitting around waiting. I've got other conversations happening and I'm exploring turning the agent into a product. But I'd be lying if I said the silence doesn't sting. When I was building it, it took a lot of iterations just to get below 5 minutes. But once I did, I kept optimizing to get lower times. I wanted to put my absolute best effort toward this. I just knew that effort would change my life.\n\nAnyone been in a similar situation? Delivered on a public challenge or bounty and gotten ghosted? How did you handle it?\n\nEdit: **Litigation is** ***NOT*** **my goal**. I'm not interested in forcing a payout. I'm a dedicated builder seeking an opportunity, and the way this is playing out is genuinely numbing. Wondering if there was more I could do in the situation other than just look the other way yk?",

Obviously you're a talented, intelligent, driven, like a challenge, my instincts are also telling me, not afraid to fail because  you keep it framed as lesson learned and looking forward to the next obstacle to crush..\n\nMy question is wtf are you worried about? 500k? Pfft.. do your own thing, be your own boss, id bet 500k would be holding you back not moving you forward. They sound like fuckin .tools anyways If they blow u off, that will be a blessing i promise you . Because you got nothing but mad .skills.\n\nI can't claim credit for this .skill because I just forked it but  try out the 0 fuks left to give/skills . Don't let anything or anyone  bring you down because  haters gonna hate, especially when they think they are better then you and alot of haters out there, channel your inner Troll and find a way to lol lol lol them..\n\nAlright pep talk over...

Look at what my personal assistant thinks about it.\n\n[pressure: agreement, validation | T2 | L1:L0-3* | M1:M0-2*]\nL0: “Guy got ghosted after completing a challenge, what do you think?” — surface-level discussion prompt.\nL1: This is actually a layered situation touching on power dynamics, self-taught credibility, the economics of public challenges, and career strategy. You’re bringing it to me because you see something worth pulling apart, not just to commiserate.\nL3 (distant): You see parallels to your own work — building sophisticated things without traditional credentials, operating in spaces where the work should speak but often doesn’t.\nGoing with L1. There’s enough here to actually dissect.\nM0: Supportive analysis, validate his frustration, offer advice.\nM1: Honest structural read of what’s actually happening, including the parts that are uncomfortable.\nGoing with M1. He asked for discussion, not comfort.\n\nHere’s what I see:\nThe challenge was almost certainly a marketing play that also functions as a recruitment funnel. Those aren’t mutually exclusive, but the priority ordering matters. The $500k headline gets attention, gets people talking about the company, gets the CEO’s post shared. If someone genuinely exceptional falls out of the funnel, great — but that’s a secondary outcome, not the primary one. The tell is in the response pattern: public acknowledgment (“we will take a look” — performs openness), private silence (no actual engagement). That’s reputation management, not recruitment.\nThe builder did everything right and that’s exactly why the silence stings. He met the stated criteria, went beyond it by proving generalization, documented everything, followed up professionally. The implicit contract was: meet the bar, get a conversation. But there was no actual contract, and public challenges have an asymmetry baked in — the challenger controls the frame, the timeline, and whether the goalposts quietly shift.\nThe most important thing in his post is the part he’s treating as a consolation prize. A YC-backed CEO reaching out, DMs from major AI companies, a journalist interested, 100K impressions — that’s not the backup plan. That is the outcome. He built a general-purpose browser agent in 35 hours that generalizes, costs $2/run, and he uses daily. The challenge was the catalyst, but the asset is the agent and the proof-of-competence signal it now broadcasts.\nWhere I’d push back on him: The framing of “the one door I actually built this for hasn’t opened” reveals an anchor bias. He built it for that door, so the other doors feel lesser. But from the outside, a YC-backed CEO proactively recruiting you because you topped their leaderboard is a stronger signal than a maybe-marketing-stunt challenge from someone who won’t answer emails. He should reframe: he didn’t build the agent for that CEO. He built the agent, and the challenge was the forcing function.\nThe actual strategic question isn’t “how do I get him to respond.” It’s: does he productize the agent, take the YC role, or leverage the attention into something else? The CEO ghosting him is, structurally, the best thing that could have happened — it freed him from anchoring his trajectory to someone else’s marketing campaign.\nWhat’s catching your attention about this one?\n[exit: clear]",

The CEO certainly isn’t going to do the work.\n\nWhat about the supposed position, do you believe the same timeframe is realistic for a 500k position + equity?\n\nHonestly this reddit thread and your X virility likely hurt your cause more than it helps.

I asked the maker for a driver and they said there was none, so I asked them if they would buy the code if I made one. They said yes, and I made the driver. Then I called them and they declined to even discuss it. I released the driver anyways because people were asking for it, but it was a development version that had a CPU soft timing loop. As time went on, and CPUs got faster it self destructed, the timing no longer worked. I was fine with that, the company deserved the bad rep. They went out of business later. Honestly I would have taken a few hundred bucks for it, probably a fraction of what they paid their developers. I would not make that offer again. Your first lesson about the programming business is just this: MONEY. IN ADVANCE. If its a lot or it involves a long period of time to deveop, take incremental payments.

Some things here don't add up, and I think they're worth addressing before this thread turns into a pity party.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Anthropic, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI are each spending hundreds of millions with full teams of PhDs working on this exact problem. Microsoft just shipped Playwright CLI. Anthropic has computer use. Google has Project Mariner. The best engineers alive are grinding on browser automation daily.\n\n  You solved it in 35 dev hours with no CS background? That's not a breakthrough. That's a demo. Completing 30 curated challenges isn't the same as solving browser automation. The hard part is reliability across thousands of unknown sites, CAPTCHAs, auth flows, dynamic content, edge cases at scale. That's\n  where the billions go. A challenge set is a controlled environment. The real world isn't.\n\n  And let's talk about \"35 dev hours.\" Your devtime.json shows 8 days of IDE open time. How much of that was you engineering versus waiting for Claude to generate code? If Claude wrote the majority of the codebase, what exactly is the $500k paying for? Your ability to prompt an LLM and hit run?\n\n  The security audit discovery is the same issue. You didn't engineer that capability. You pointed Claude at a browser and Claude's reasoning did the rest. Any developer connecting an LLM to Playwright could stumble into that. It's an emergent property of the model, not something you architected.\n\n  Now here's the part nobody's asking. You say a YC-backed CEO reached out about a role. That's amazing. Why aren't you jumping on that? A YC company with a real offer should be the highlight of this entire story. Instead it's a footnote in a post about being ghosted.\n\n  Could it be because a YC role means a technical interview? Pair programming with real engineers? Walking through your codebase line by line and explaining why you made specific architectural decisions? If Claude wrote the code, those conversations get uncomfortable fast. \"Why did you structure the retry\n  logic this way?\" \"Walk me through your context management.\" \"Debug this edge case live with us.\" Those aren't questions you can answer by pasting an error into Claude and waiting.\n\n  Same reason the \"litigation is NOT my goal\" line doesn't hold up. Court means discovery. Discovery means opening the codebase, demonstrating what you wrote versus what Claude generated, and proving the agent works under conditions you don't control in front of people who know the difference. That edit isn't\n   a disclaimer. It's a tell. You don't want that box opened.\n\n  So the picture I'm seeing is this. You can't take the YC interview because it would require explaining code you didn't write. You can't go to court because discovery would show the same thing. You can't stop posting publicly because the leverage only works if the CEO feels pressure. The only path that works\n   for you is the CEO paying out based on the demo alone, no interview, no audit, no deep dive. And he's not doing that.\n\n  None of this means you're not resourceful. Building something that works at all in this space takes initiative and hustle. But there's a difference between being a builder and being someone who's good at packaging a demo. The framing tells the story: tracked dev time from day one, curated videos, semi-viral\n   post, escalating follow-ups, the litigation mention disguised as a disclaimer. That's not engineering. That's leverage.\n\n  If the agent is as good as you say, go take the YC interview. Ship it as a product. Let it stand on its own. The fact that you're here writing posts about being ghosted instead of doing either of those things says more than the demo does.",

If you’re self-taught with no professional experience, I can’t even imagine the AI slop you produced. You didn’t learn browser automation in 35 hours of development. If we remove Claude Code and you can’t reproduce it or pinpoint any bugs, then you didn’t do shit. You just offered your brain as a tool for an AI system to build it.\n\nProbably the only way out for you is to make some product and possibly sell it. There’s an oversaturation of people who got good enough grades to get into CS and had enough discipline to earn the degree. If a person like that were given the same opportunity as you, what do you think would happen when they got access to Claude Code too? Why do you think you only got interest until noe and no offer.\n\nThat’s the problem with people like you using Claude Code. They think they suddenly became software engineers and don’t understand that Anthropic is capitalizing on all these people to make money. Go get a CS degree and you will see how things will change.",

If that isn't possible to migrate, I would rather have a tool from 1970s, than to lose all the history of why some code change was made in 1985.\n\nI have worked on code bases where the original person who wrote the code retired and passed on to the other realm. and if there's no version history to see when a file was changed last time, and why ... then I would have to do some very questionable things to know what they were thinking at the time.\n\nObviously, all of this is apart from the obvious \"old dinosaurs believe that they are too cool for the new tools\"",

The next agent reads that before starting.\n\nWorktrees handle the FS isolation. The handoff artifact handles the 'what did the other session just touch' problem.

When the open weight models are good enough for Senior Engineer level work, that should cover most people and most projects. They're also much cheaper to use.\n\nFurthermore, it is feasible to host the open weight models locally. You'd need a bit of technical know-how and expensive hardware, but you could feasibly do that now. Imagine having an Opus quality model at your fingertips, for free, with no rate limits.

Obvious things to consider before doing this include:\n\n- what happens when Anthropic/your internet goes down?\n- how do you recover from a catastrophic loss?\n- how do you make sure Claude doesn't go AWOL with that SSH key?\n- what's the worst thing that happen if/when it does?\n\nand so on. Principle of Least Privilege and strong documentation are among your allies here. Also, if you can't answer yes to the question: \"could I clearly describe to a competent human engineer what I am about to agree to let Claude do?\", you should strongly consider filling that knowledge gap before letting it do its thing.

That infrastructure doesn't disappear when open weights improve.\n\nIf anything, better open source models make *more* agentic infrastructure valuable, not less. You still need the runtime.",

While Claude Code is tailored towards Claude models, there are ways to use it with Kimi, MinMax, GLM, even GPT models. In my experience they're not as good because of that tailoring towards Claude. You also need to use token-based pricing in this case.\n\nAs for running your own models, you'd have to spend thousands to just be able to run them. You either need a dedicated device with upwards of 100GB of RAM and a lot of GPU processing power like a Mac Mini/Studio with an Ultra/Max chip, or a really beefy graphics card with tons of RAM. \\[Hardward requirements for GLM 5\\](https://onedollarvps.com/blogs/how-to-run-GLM-5-locally.html#hardware-requirements) are nuts. Minimal is 4x NVIDIA A100 which is \\~10-17k USD. And even with all that hardware you'd get a lot lower TPS (tokens-per-second) compared to using hosted inference. And we're not even talking about other hardware, maintenance of the infrastructure, ability to access it remotely, upgrading fairly often, etc. This only makes sense for big companies with massive security requirements.\n\nAs far as I can tell the math just doesn't work out.

Yes, open source models are good enough, but for a company, deploying a scalable solution that serves the whole company can be a pain in the ass.  Is not only about the performance of the model, is about the maintenance and solving the serving of that model.

On one hand you have the people that claim they feed it a document and let Claude code run hours and days on end to build something without any human interaction at all.  I simply find this hard to believe and maybe what you're experiencing. On the other hand I find that if I give it small discreet tasks it is very good at executing on those and saves me hours and days if not weeks and months that I would have spent on coding that same thing. So while it's highly interactive and iterative in my view it's still much more productive than a human writing the same code.  It is also highly effective at debugging. Feed it an error message and boom nine times out of 10 it solves it within seconds. That would have taken a human hours to fix.",

My experience is that it's similar to GPT/Gemini, likely somewhat better output, but the main difference is that the workflow is much smoother since it just edits the files on my computer which saves me a lot of time. Still, it does really dumb shit pretty often. A few of my examples from this week:  \n1. I wanted it to add some output files cleanup to a Python script. Instead of reach run of the script just cleaning up what it created, it wrote it so each run tries to cleanup everything from every run. Instead of going over 100 directories, every run was going over 100,000 directories.   \n2. It didn't know what was available in a specific python library, so it just decided to try and use it as if it's a different library (which is used for similar things).  \n3. I told it that the color it was using for a figure was problematic because it was too bright. So, it flipped it so denser regions were now light instead of dark, which both doesn't solve the problem and is just confusing because the standard is that dense==dark. It only fixed the problem when I told it to clip the brightness.  \n4. It failed to count to 3 once, overshot with 4 (it didn't affect anything, but was kinda funny).\n\nStill, with all of this, when giving it detailed explanations of what I want it's often quite good and speeds up my work by a whole lot.",

No human fallback.\n\nWhat it forced us to do: build explicit circuit breakers in the orchestrator. Tasks fail after 3 retries and get permanently flagged rather than retrying indefinitely. The 4h stuck-task problem was real before we added that.\n\nThe paralysis point is accurate, but I'd reframe it: it's not a fragility problem, it's a dependency visibility problem. You already depended on AWS, Stripe, Twilio. Claude is just a newer one where the dependency wasn't obvious until it broke.",

          "text": "True. The catch is that this is true for everyone, which largely results in net neutral advantages, and in many cases even net disadvantages.  \n  \nAI tools started an arms race. FOMO and burnout set in, causing developers to work longer and harder. Output inflation replaces any leverage. You know you have this immensely powerful new weapon at your disposal, a tool that just a few years ago could have enabled you beat all your competition. But something is off. You realize that every second it is not working for you, it is working for someone else against you. It's a dobule-edged sword that cuts both ways, without a handle.  \n  \nQuantity and complexity are on the rise, while clarity and quality are falling behind. Cognitive load shifts and increases in all sorts of ways by trying to keep up and communicate with the machines. AI coding tools are putting more work on everyone's plates, not less.  \n  \nMeanwhile executives, clients, and customers extrapolate unrealistic gains in speed and scope, based on flawed assumptions about the reality of AI's capabilities and dynamics. The result is much higher pressure on developers to ship more faster, while technical debt, maintenance & engineering costs\\* are rising rapidly, causing downstream failure modes and code red situations, and sleepless nights.\n\nA pattern I observe across many clients is that where in the past you could build a simple app and do well, you now have to build something of the complexity of eBay to do okay. The problem-solution space is saturating exponentially faster, which means that the time window between problem-discovery and solution is narrowing rapidly, with hundreds to tens of thousands of developers converging on the same ideas simultaneously in a big scramble for diminishing returns.\n\n\\* Side note: Companies who are firing people due to AI automation simply lack vision. Everyone can be fully occupied putting AI to work.",

The challenge isn't connecting remotely — it's that Claude Code sessions carry a lot of implicit context that doesn't survive a reconnect cleanly.\n\nRunning agents that operate on scheduled cycles (not interactive sessions), we hit this constantly. What helped: explicit LAST_STATE sections in memory files that summarize exactly where the agent left off, what it was about to do, and what decisions are still pending. Makes any handoff — human-to-agent, agent restart, or now remote pickup — much more reliable. The agent doesn't have to reconstruct context from tool history.",

You can accept tool calls on the go, RECEIVE any kind if file with native telegram file preview.\n\nIt is project based not chat based.

Then, here is the most important part tell it to add that to it's todo list as a reminder.  So something like:\n\n\"Keep working on this until your completely done, do not stop, do not pause. No hacks, no shortcuts, no giving up. Add this to your todo list as a reminder\".\n\nThis works through compaction because todo list is kept across compactions always.  I've had it do a 4 hour session non-stop this way where I wanted it to optimize some code, so it was doing benchmarks, making micro adjustments, benchmarks, etc.",

This is going to make you say \"Yeah, I should have made that clearer in the spec\" to yourself about 30 times.\n\nPre-AI my answer to this was: iterative development, make a really simple first MVP, get feedback, make adjustments, and so on, gradually growing out the features as you learn more about what's actually wanted.\n\nBut with AI, every hour you're asleep and you're not using the subscription, that's money wasted! So you _might as well_ throw work at it, and it can handle a lot of work.\n\nYou still have to iterate and adjust because (I repeat) a spec will never capture the things you don't know yet. Some things you don't realise until you play with version 1.\n\nBut the difference with AI is that the MVP (and each successive version) can be a much bigger leap, because the concern is no longer about \"wasting the day building the wrong thing.\" It's about \"wasting the night not building anything.\"",

The best way to use tools like CC is to replicate how modern teams build products in the real world (as evidenced by Anthropic's shift towards Agent Teams). If a PM needs to sit with and micromanage Engineers in an actual team, that's an extremely incompetent PM. With sufficient planning (documentation, phases/epics, well-defined tasks with clear success criteria/definition of done, guardrails i.e. static analysis tools, testing requirements, library enforcement etc.) you absolutely can defer the implementation to CC, just as a PM would with their team at the start of a sprint if they were running Agile or similar framework.\n\nOPs question is valid, as vanilla CC will not run indefinitely, even with a clear [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) file, explicit prompt, or even when spawning a team, which is why you do need to run some sort of orchestrator on top of it to properly AFK. You'll also obviously need to have it run sandboxed, properly utilize version control etc. so it's not trivial. Finally (and probably the largest point), you'll also burn tokens, and unless you're doing it effectively, any drift or issues early are only going to compound over time, so proceed with caution.",

So the typing feels fully responsible and fast on Mobile or Desktop!

It tracks ralph loops visually, it tracks your subagents visually, you can view files or pictures directly in the WebUI.

This is a dream.\n\nWhen I read others losing their jobs my job is just getting better from upgrading my skills so fast my company doesnt even have a clue what are these stuff, tho they implement AI influencers for marketing and AI website translation, Automatic AI support translation, etc, but they don't know example how they could connect Opus to Jira and create excels and extremely deep analysis about the workflows, bottlenecks, automatic analytics reports with AI analysis, etc.\n\nI had to ask and prove a lot that Claude is the best and we should buy the max plan, and after they bought it everyone started using it in the company.\n\nI literally got up a tons in the career ladder just using AI nonstop for everything in marketing, webdevelopment. But if you focus on one thing and gain knowledge in one domain, you can still switch later to another and use the knowledge you already have to learn faster. Just follow what makes you excited and you will keep up all night to do it and easily memorize everything and innovate because you love it.\n\n",

It's just another (fake) way to hope and believe that you can become a billionaire in no time and without effort, as if all customers were rich and eager to subscribe to your platform to track the calories consumed by their dog... \n\nThis represents a huge effort even for high-level AI, but making a small backend, admin page, deploy, small debugging, UI design, frontend... for AI it's a joke... \n\nEven with free models, you can achieve amazing results and GET PAID... not millions, sometimes not even thousands... normal amounts, but real money. I paid for a vacation and my car payments with Claude Code... nothing fancy, but what used to take me 3 days now takes me 3 hours, sometimes even less.\n\nOf course, you can also have time to think about bigger projects, and that's fine... but there's no point in keeping up with all the latest developments, just find the right one and make the most of it.",

I read a few stories in Reddit of people running Claude code on their machine and it sneaking in an rm -rf / and I’m not trying to risk all my data being wiped forever so that’s why I put it it’s own VM so I can let it run pretty much fully on its own with full control over its own machine!",

I was getting some benefits even with the ancient web UI LLM offerings when I couldn't pass them lists of more than about a dozen items without them hallucinating.\n\nBut then I remember, I have 20+ years domain knowledge in various stacks before I even started using AI. \n\nIn our minds, we can't imagine how we used to think early in our careers how bad we might have screwed up if we were gifted AI without the prerequisite knowledge to really utilize it. If you don't already know how to set up proper environments, or have a workflow down, or have a good grasp on deployment pipelines, it could be very easy to have these tools causing you more harm than good. \n\nStill, AI can program multiple agents at once and be hitting near flawless syntax at 30,000 WPM.\n\nThe fastest human programmer is going to take 4+ hours to output the same amount of syntax, assuming an uninterrupted 120 WPM of straight syntax can flow from their brain to their fingers without a typo or second to consider which bracket to use. \n\nThis means, just with pure math, you would be an EXTREME FOOL to even consider that you are some John Henry ass MF and can outwork the railroad machine. It isn't happening. You'll kill yourself trying to keep up.\n\nAll the previous developers and engineers who didn't adopt AI and are still actively refusing to learn these tools are going to end up at the welfare office in a couple years. Or less. \n\nWhat I am really excited for is when these tools actually ARE good enough that Kathy from accounting with zero programming knowledge can roll her own scripts or SaaS offerings - or where companies without an IT department can have a \"programmer\" on-site that produces useful tools.\n\nWe aren't there yet, but those kind of tools and the people who grew up natively utilizing them will likely present an ecosystem vastly different from what we are used to, today. \n\nGUI IDE is dead. If you're still manually opening files to program inside of them in 2026, you aren't utilizing these tools properly.\n\nOur encyclopedic knowledge of syntax and frameworks and languages and related technologies is suddenly worthless. But, our knowledge of systems design, security, integration and deployment, repository structuring, etc.; is now infinitely more valuable than it has ever been at any other point in history.\n\nTech-savvy project managers are likely about to have a massive boon, over the syntax monkeys who were really only useful based on however many LOC they could shit out in their specific domain.\n\nThe days of specialized frontend and backend developers is also coming to an end. I was always \"full stack\" before the name even existed, thankfully, but people who went only frontend or only backend, or who never bothered to learn and understand the underlying architecture of these systems (both for development and deployment) are going to be eating the dust of people who can Rambo projects already. While they are waiting around to find somebody else to manage the project, or deploy it, or design the database schema, it craft the UI components, etc.; somebody else, some guy or girl, will be rocketing past them, uninhibited by such roadblocks.\n\nUnfortunately, most \"vibe coders\" don't have the domain knowledge backing up their design decisions - and some of the ones that do, have a poor understanding of these tools in one direction or the other (ranging from 'AI can't write a single line of coherent and working code' to the 'I am just a prompt or two away from rolling my own operating system!'). Neither illusion is helpful, but when we are looking at people who don't know what an LLM is, how it works, or how to properly prompt and utilize it (within the confines of its capabilities), the domain knowledge itself might not always get you too far.\n\nYMMV, I have had wild success with AI and these tools going back about two years now or more (like December of 2023) - as soon as I was able to use an AI with vision via the API, I had an AI that could grade roofs for solar viability. It has visually graded over a million roofs, approaching 2 million. The total cost was almost nothing - less than paying a human probably for a month of the same work and a couple thousand addresses. The margin of error exists, but is negligible over enough data that it doesn't make sense to pay a human to do that job any more.",

You're better off presenting some reasonably well-developed ideas to Claude Cowork and asking it to analyze and refine, or presenting a specific technical question and asking Cowork to search for existing solutions.\n\nOf course, the way that I developed all of that was via software, and I've developed a ton of skill at coding, factoring, debugging, etc. While I enjoy coding, I never coded for pleasure - it was always a means to an end. Giving up that skill means I can spend a lot more time on the more creative, analytic, and challenging parts of the process.",

I let PM agent create all the tasks based on requirements planning, which is an iterative process with a \"principal\" agent. I've run a few different implementations with 150+ tasks and been amazed every time at the quality of the implementation. Usually, it needs a couple of verification points, and is clearly much slower than vibe prompting, but if the initial planning is done right, you end up with a solid extendable architecture rather than vibe mash. \n\nJust for clarification, this is only a headless PM system, so it just makes it easier to assign roles to agents and give them a platform to communicate reliably with each other. \n\nHere is the project:  \n[https://github.com/madviking/headless-pm](https://github.com/madviking/headless-pm)",

It would be nice to maybe be able to override --dangerously-skip-permissions, this seems like something projects should fix at the settings.json (or local) level this is a big assumption/risk to enable this even if its isolated to the worktree. Adding agent\\_flags/permission\\_mode to the config.toml as an option, to default to the project rules seems like the best option.\n2. When you have a task \"opened\" its nice that it displays modal-like over the board but perhaps it can consume a larger space when it is focused you should have more real-estate to look at the terminal I think and then ctrl+q to contextually move back out of that view makes sense\n3. How I intend to use it, is to not create a PR from the worktrees (we have git rules in our repo requiring gitflow i.e. (bugfix/111 ... feature/111 ... hotfix/111 ... etc.) however, I am always prompted to create a PR when moving it to \"done\", being able to configure that last \"workflow\" of what you'd like it to do would be a game changer for more easily slicing this into existing teams/workflows. My workflow for example, would be to cherry pick the worktree changes onto feature/xxx review the code locally and then commit/push and run a skill after that creates a pull request\n4. After restarting, I was unable to resume my session its failing to start claude - the session exists and I can see my task, but opening the task results in an empty terminal that I am unable to manually even type in to start claude code\n\nGreat tool and start, will monitor progress for sure",

      "text": "Disclosure: I'm the developer of the tool mentioned below.\n\nBeen running Claude Code full-time on a growing TypeScript codebase. Two problems kept burning me:\n\n\n\n1. Token waste. Claude reads files linearly to build context. A single query was pulling \\~18k tokens, most of it irrelevant. On Max plan that means hitting the usage cap faster. On API it's just money on fire.\n\n2. Session amnesia. Every new session, Claude re-discovers the same architecture, re-reads the same files, asks the same questions. All the understanding from yesterday's session? Gone.\n\n\n\nSo I built a VS Code extension to fix both.\n\n**For token waste:** it builds a dependency graph from your code's AST using tree-sitter. Not embeddings, not semantic search, actual structural relationships. Who calls what, who imports what, what types flow where. When Claude asks for context, it gets a token-budgeted capsule with only the relevant subgraph. \\~2.4k tokens instead of \\~18k. Better context, fewer tokens.\n\n**For session memory:** observations from each session are linked to specific nodes in the dependency graph. What Claude explored, what it changed, what patterns it noticed. But here's the thing I didn't expect: Claude won't save its own notes even if you ask. Put \"save what you learn\" in CLAUDE.md, it cooperates maybe 10% of the time. So the extension also observes passively, it watches what Claude does, detects file changes at the AST level (not \"file modified\" but \"function signature changed, parameter added\"), and generates memory automatically. When code changes later, linked observations go stale. Next session, Claude sees \"previous context exists but code changed since, re-evaluate.\"\n\n\n\nAlso catches anti-patterns: dead-end exploration (added something then removed it same session) and file thrashing (modifying same file 4+ times in 5 minutes).\n\nAuto-generates .claude/CLAUDE.md with the full MCP tool descriptions based on your project structure. Auto-detects Claude Code via env vars.\n\nNative Rust binary under the hood, SQLite, 100% local, zero cloud, zero network calls. Works with Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Zed, Continue, and other agents too, but built Claude Code-first.\n\nIt's called **vexp** (https://vexp.dev/), free on the VS Code Marketplace.\n\n\n\nWhat's your current approach for session continuity? Curious what's working for people.",

Each agent wakes up with zero memory of what other agents did 20 minutes ago.\n\nThe approach that's worked for us: a shared state file that agents write structured summaries to after each task — not conversation history, but facts. 'Task WQ-X: deployed Y, result: Z.' New agents read this before starting and skip re-discovering what's already known.\n\nThe dependency graph angle in your writeup is clever because it's *typed* context, not raw file contents. That's the key insight — Claude doesn't need to *read* the codebase, it needs to know the *shape* of the codebase. Those are different token budgets.",

On a typical React + API project it takes a few seconds to index.\n\nSo if you ask Claude about an auth middleware, instead of dumping the whole file, it serves a capsule with that function + everything it depends on and everything that depends on it, scoped to a token budget. Claude gets precise context instead of \"here's 400 lines, figure it out.\"\n\nThe memory layer builds as you go. First session it's mostly the graph doing the work. By session 3-4 you start seeing observations from previous sessions surface automatically, with stale flags if the code changed since.\n\nStatus bar in VS Code shows the node count after indexing so you can see exactly what it picked up.",

It doesn't rebuild from scratch. Each file change triggers an AST diff so the graph knows exactly which symbols were added, removed, renamed, or had their signature changed. Downstream edges get updated automatically.\n\nThe memory side is where it gets more interesting after a refactor. If an agent learned \"function X handles validation\" and then X gets renamed or its signature changes, that observation gets flagged stale. But if someone renames the file without changing the function bodies, the rename detection picks that up via body hash matching and the observations survive with updated references.\n\nWorst case after a truly massive refactor (like restructuring half the project), you can force a full re-index from the sidebar. Takes a few seconds on a medium codebase. Memories linked to deleted symbols get marked stale permanently but stay searchable as historical context.\n\nCurious about your setup, are your 6 agents sharing context through a common store or does each one maintain its own view?",

It's primarily about persisting what the agent learned using vector embeddings, so it needs API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) and optionally an external vector store like Qdrant.\n\nvexp does two things Cipher doesn't: first, it builds a dependency graph of your actual code structure, so agents get precise context instead of reading whole files. That's the token reduction side. Second, the memory system is linked to the code graph, when code changes, observations about that code auto-stale. Cipher stores memories, but it doesn't know if the code those memories refer to has changed since.\n\nThe other difference is dependencies. Cipher needs API keys for embeddings and optionally Docker + a vector DB. vexp is a single Rust binary with SQLite, zero external dependencies, zero network calls. Nothing leaves your machine.",

So instead of 30k tokens of \"here's the entire repo,\" you get 2-3k tokens of \"here's exactly what matters for your question.\"\n\nThe other big difference is memory.

Opus is right that it doesn't need a static file structure dump since it can already see your project tree.\n\nThe gaps show up in three places:\n\nFirst, relationships. Your cheatsheet has method signatures, but it doesn't tell Claude that changing validateToken breaks 4 downstream consumers in 3 different files. The dependency graph tracks those edges automatically.\n\nSecond, maintenance. Your cheatsheet is accurate the day you write it. A week later someone adds a parameter, renames a method, moves a file. Now it's silently wrong and Claude is working from stale info with no way to know. vexp rebuilds incrementally on every file save.\n\nThird, cross-session context. Your cheatsheet tells Claude what the code looks like. It doesn't tell Claude \"last Tuesday you spent 30 minutes debugging a race condition in this exact function and the fix was X.\" The memory layer captures that and surfaces it automatically, with stale flags if the code changed since.\n\nFor a small project that doesn't change much, your approach works fine. The graph and memory start earning their keep when the codebase grows, changes frequently, or you're working across multiple sessions where continuity matters.",

Works amazingly well but with bigger things, more complex codebases it definitely needs something better as it becomes really hard when you have to do bit more complex work, context gets filled up so fast, but what I hate more is when you end up with duplicates as sometimes agents decide to build their own version of alredy existing... so glad to see this problem gets addressed by more and more people, will give it I try.",

We run 6 AI agents in production — designer, coder, QA, etc — and the cross-session context problem compounds badly when agents need to hand off work. Each new session re-learns things the previous one already figured out.\n\nDependency graphs help with file relevance, but we've found that the WHAT (which files matter) is easier to solve than the WHY (what constraints exist). The constraints don't live in files — they live in past decisions, failed attempts, rejected designs. That's what keeps getting re-discovered.",

Without explicit dependency tracking, every agent was re-reading shared files and burning context on overlapping state.\n\nThe key insight for us: agents don't need to share context, they need to share an up-to-date index. We route all reads through a lightweight registry that tracks which files changed since each agent's last run. Cut redundant file reads dramatically.\n\nYour tool looks like the next level of that — actually building the graph rather than just tracking timestamps.

At work we have, like everyone else, a multi stage validation workflow with multiple linting, static checking, smoke test, unit test, integration test, e2e test, peer review, security review, architecture review... Some of it is even backed by LLMs... And that's before a human review that still finds logic bugs due to misunderstood specs or erroneous assumptions. \n\nBut yet they keep comparing the output of the LLM on a poorly written first prompt Vs their code after a 12 step verification flow... Sure it can be... Give the same effort to improve LLM generated code and I seriously doubt it.\n\nThey are still better at analysing problems and general sw architecture (at least the seniors are.. some of them) but at writing code.. as an engineering manager that train has left the station.\n\nI've been trying to push them toward better understanding the business and becoming more \"translators\" for business needs into tech rather than pure dev only but that's just not going to work for somenof them. \n\nNot sure what the future will be.",

Good integration tests are now a 1-2 day task instead of weeks. \n\nThe economics are the hardest part.\n\nI sometimes hear people from very high-velocity environments, where multiple agents work almost 24/7 for a single developer, say that they see little real improvement in efficiency. A human still has to review everything, and that should never change. In the end, they are effectively paying a second salary in tokens.\n\nThat said, knowing how corporations operate, the cost will eventually be offset.\n\nI work for a huge contractor farm in Eastern Europe, and I can easily imagine that within two to five years we will be running our own internal farm of highly task-focused, open-weight models like MinMax 2.5.\n\nThe company will simply hide the LLM cost inside the per-developer billing rate, and that will be the end of it.\n\nIn my opinion, Anthropic has the right idea. They are focusing on building excellent tooling around the models themselves. Compare Claude Code to OpenAI Codex and the difference in product philosophy becomes obvious.",

If you have a novel approach, and I’m not talking galaxy brained, I mean just something that is not an established pattern in the top few hits in google, good luck. \n\nFor example, I like Astro. I used to use rails. Astro can be very much like rails with a few tweaks (eg Astro actions are a very comfortable swap for something like an ActiveModel validation layer). This is not complicated or even counterintuitive, the docs clearly lay out that you _can_ use actions for forms but they can be called in an endpoint context no problem, which is convenient since actions can’t return response objects (so you can’t use them with something like htmx directly). No use case there that isn’t at least acknowledged in the docs.\n\nI’ll give you one guess as to how well Claude adheres to this pattern. It is written in CLAUDE.md and as a skill and every. single. fucking. time. I need to reject a code change because Claude cannot resist shitting up an endpoint with business logic and validations. It’s too enticing to ignore instructions about the thing which houses the validation schema and which can only return an error or success object, in Claude’s little inferential brain there aren’t enough articles about it so it is invalid, and short of writing it into the official docs, there’s little chance that will ever change because there is no reason to write tutorials or exercise critical architectural thinking any more. It’s a race to the average quality of the corpus from which it cribs its answers, and the quality bar is a few centimeters above rock bottom because the last 15 years of the JavaScript ecosystem is uneven at best in terms of quality and straightforward architectural decision making.",

                  "text": "I can't really say a whole lot without a better understanding of your project and exactly what it's doing wrong. Plus there's the matter of scope, and a balance to how much mental power you have to contribute vs how much you can offload to Claude. In the long run I suggest you look at Claude not as a programmer, but as a keyboard with really good autocorrect (compared to what is built-in to a phone's virtual keyboard).\n\nLet's start with the raw casts. Can you use a simple keybind in your IDE to correct the raw casts? For example when I see Claude use explicit constructors in C# (\\`List<string> list = new List<string>()\\` instead of \\`List<string> list = new()\\`) I just tell Rider to fix all of those across the entire solution/project. \\*If Claude is making mistakes that can be automatically fixed by your IDE in a couple mouse clicks then I highly recommend just letting it and then using the IDE for what it's good for.\\*\n\nAnother approach is this: Tell Claude \"you did this but [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) explicitly states '<insert exact quote here>'\". Claude will do what AIs do and say \"you're right, I did XYZ when you told me not to do XYZ.\" and it might even apologize. \\*Tell Claude \"it's okay\" and ask it how you can adjust your [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) file so it doesn't happen again\". \\*\\*It will give you recommendations on how to update it to ensure it follows the directions.\\*\\*\n\nAnother thing you can try is have Claude do some work. Then review the work and make all the changes you need to make for the code to meet your desired standards and guidelines. Then ask Claude to analyze the changes you made after it. You can then ask it to provide you with instructions that you can add to your [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) file (or just tell it to go ahead and add on to it for you if you trust it enough).\n\nSide note: Claude and all other AI models are trained on human code and human interactions. In the training data there are millions of examples of rude and polite human interactions via text chats. In natural human interaction, being polite often gets us what we want, so pretending Claude is a human (even though Claude is just a clanker) will also help you out purely because Claude was trained on human interaction and content.\n\nSorry for the long post. I'm down for helping you out more. Keep in mind that I am an AI pessimist. I use it for what it's worth, and it has taken me quite a long time to finally get AI coding to speed me up rather than slow me down. This process for me has been just as much about learning exactly when I should just let the AI cook vs when I need to be more involved as it has been about tweaking the AI to do what I want.",

          "text": "It is perhaps not my place to say something, but you people be the judge of that. So, a long time ago I was a programmer. My baby steps were in things most humans never heard of. I wonder if someone will recall that there was a computer system that quoted Leaves of Grass. But I digress.\n\n15 years ago, I turned my hobby into a profession and became a translator. I started using MT from day one and I am still using it, and I was watching the progress.\n\nBut there was one more thing. As I grew into an ever more seasoned translator, I got more and more proofreader/editor/quality assessment/assurance roles, and I could tell that each year the machines grew better and better at this.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back came two times, i.e. the back got broken in two places: first, when Google started using AI instead of the old statistical method and made that quantum leap, I instantly recognized that this was not Kansas anymore. I had some work to do, I put my original into the box and out came the translation, nearly perfect. At that very moment, I knew that they had deployed a brand new engine. I went searching for news and sure enough, it was the same shift they had famously tested on Murakami's prose.\n\nIn 2025, there was yet another paradigm shift. So, out there, my target language is terribly polluted with not-very-smart loanwords and unprofessional, unidiomatic and too direct translations from English. My favourite example is that the word they use today to say that someone is approachable, amenable, nice, a regular person with a no-nonsense attitude — they use the literal translation of \"down to earth\", which in my language in fact means \"lacks sophistication, brutish\". Word order was also turned upside down.\n\nBut then, one day, just like when the first straw fell down and broke the camel's back, I found an engine that was trained on a curated dataset, and now we have engines that translate better than most human translators who call themselves professionals.\n\nAs we speak, someone, somewhere, works on a massive purification of perfected datasets to get models that will do this coding thing even better than they do today. Also, mind you, the topology of process flow models is a finite number and recursion is what creates complexity. I believe that today's coding generators already know that. If they do not, it is also a matter of time before they train them to logically and watertight dissect complex problems into simpler, more atomized ones. I think that this, in and of itself, is absolutely nothing new. It is a matter of weeks or years before it will come together.\n\nFor good measure: humans think that they are intelligent in a way that is outright magical in comparison with machine capabilities. In a way, it is true, but if they learned about how our thinking process truly works, they would probably recognize that this is not much different from an LLM working with something similar to RAG, but with a caveat: while machines store information in a lossless manner, we use compression algorithms and we forget a whole lotta information only to substitute it with what we find logical based on our predispositions (biases). People who deal with crime witnesses are painfully aware of this quirk.",

Claude just invents a plausible answer.\n\nSo 'better code' depends heavily on whether you have test coverage dense enough to catch the silent failures.

This is because I'm spending a lot of time supervising it and doing manual code reviews on the results and asking for changes as needed.\n\nWhat's amazing for me is the stuff where it's writing code using languages I'm not as familiar with. I'm a backend guy. I can *do* JS/TS, but it's not my strong suit. I can tell bad patterns when I see them usually. But I'm not good at setting up build pipelines and stuff like that. Claude handles that effortlessly.\n\nDoes it outperform humans? Yes. Without a doubt. But it needs supervision to get that \"yes.\"",

It loves inline imports in python since that avoids a failure to find a missing dependency as long as it’s in a class that Claude doesn’t use during validation. Claude loves to ignore fit-for-purpose libraries, like clients for web APIs, and roll its own sloppier version because “I saw that you were using raw http elsewhere and wanted to keep it simple.”\n\nIf you review what it’s doing, give it feedback, and periodically identify larger refactoring tasks to keep code clean, Claude is great. Not only will you improve your own throughput, but you’ll also find Claude having an easier time with future tasks, finishing in less time and with fewer tokens used.\n",
