At this point, they're doing it in a legal way (scanning and destruction of the book). The real concern at this point is the difference of environment that the AI is contained in. American models have plenty of issues surrounding them. One of the main ones is safety.\n\n\nIdk about you, but safety isnt the first thing that comes to mind when I think of China. Maybe thats me just watching one too many Liveleak videos. The other issue is government. Yes, the American models/labs have their own problems with that, but I see the US as the lesser of two evils (Ill be honest in saying its not by a wide margin).\n\n\nAGI/ASI will eventually fix these problems one way or another (e.g. its not a problem if you no longer exist), but the bridge between now and then may be the most precarious position humanity will ever be in. Racing the CCP on AI development is not something we should want to do while crossing that bridge.\n\n\nIf AI development was devoid of government influence and everyone had the same or better safety standards? Id say the more the merrier. \n\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk...",

          "text": "What if AI labs built ONE incredible model together? CERN for AI 🌳  \nThe Anthropic distillation drama got me thinking — 24,000 fake accounts exist because knowledge naturally wants to flow between models. What if we stopped building walls and built rivers instead? Right now \\~$30-50B is spent across 10+ labs training models that do \\~85-90% the same tasks. Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok, Qwen, DeepSeek — they're all reinventing the same bicycle separately 🚲 **The proposal:** Labs jointly train ONE shared foundation model (the expensive part), then each fine-tunes their own version for safety, personality, and specialization. **Why it works:**\n\n* Like CERN — shared accelerator, competing research teams, diverse discoveries\n* Like Android — Google builds the OS, Samsung/Xiaomi customize\n* DeepSeek proved breakthroughs come from clever IDEAS, not just more compute. A shared base frees resources for more experimentation, not less **Addressing the monopoly concern:** One big unified dream team + one independent challenger team. Built-in healthy rivalry without 10x redundancy. **The math:** Pooled compute could produce a model \\~40-60% more powerful than any current individual model. That gap could matter for AGI timelines. Distillation isn't really \"stealing\" — the original stays with the creator. It's multiplying and even improving knowledge. So why not do it openly? Cooperation > secret distillation. What do you think?\n\n",

Watching multiple agents as little \"coworkers\" feels way easier to reason about than a pile of terminals.\n\nCurious if youve thought about exposing an API so other agent runners (LangGraph/AutoGen style) can push state into the same office view. Also +1 on the worktrees idea, parallel agents stepping on each other is the pain.\n\nIf youre collecting patterns on multi-agent orchestration and guardrails, Ive been bookmarking notes here: https://www.agentixlabs.com/blog/ (some good stuff on keeping agents observable).",

The JSONL watching has its issues though as I mentioned, but I think its key that it hooks directly to what’s already available. As for the filename they are working on, sometimes it shows it in the agent status like above the character’s head. Like “Reading package.json” or “Writing CLAUDE.md”, but to make it less cluttered you need to hover on the character to see it. Thanks for the kind words and hope you enjoy!",

Game room, they play some video games, ping-pong, etc\n2. Coffe place (well I see that there is already a coffe place, but they should go there automatically when they are idle) \n3. The FIght Club Room !!!!! (this can be a lot of fun)\n\nAlso, will be nice to integrate it with the others CLI's (codex/gemini) , or you can set a directory and read from there (or multiple directories). And if you are running several AI at the same time (I do that sometimes) you can identify them , like to have a letter in their heads or base (C/G/C) or something like that.\n\nAmazing work !!!\n\nAnd I leave you the first 5 stars in vs marketplace :) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ls1b4nkc8lg1.png?width=317&format=png&auto=webp&s=a47b0653b49fd6a59f1c5723e0befaf341fff151",

Solve all 30 browser navigation challenges on his website in under 5 minutes using an AI agent, and he'd offer $500k/year cash + equity to join his team. Open to anyone. Use any tools. Email the submission.\n\nI'm self taught. No CS degree, no PhD, no professional software engineering experience. I learned browser automation inside-out specifically for this challenge, built a general purpose browser agent in about 35 dev hours, and completed all 30 stages in 3 minutes 44 seconds.\n\nNot a script. No overfit prompts to his specific challenges. A general purpose agent that I also ran on a completely different set of browser challenges to prove it generalizes. Cost per run was about $2. I still use it daily for my normal work because it outperforms anything else available right now.\n\n[I even found out it was capable of security legitimate security audits.](https://x.com/brianbellx/status/2024132949671584252?s=20) (before Claude Code Security was released) And when I pointed it at my own apps, it found and exploited real vulnerabilities. That was never part of the design, the agent just figured it out with the tools it had already.\n\nI emailed him everything. Videos of both runs, full codebase, repro instructions, run stats. [He responded publicly on X saying \"we will take a look\"](https://x.com/adcock_brett/status/2021806606498034069?s=20) but never replied to the email. I sent a follow-up after a few days. Nothing. Sent a third follow-up today after a full week of silence. Still nothing.\n\n[Meanwhile I posted about it on X and it went semi-viral (\\~100K impressions off a small account).](https://x.com/brianbellx/status/2021076906276262353?s=20) Got DMs from people at major AI companies, a journalist, and today a YC-backed CEO reached out about a role after I topped their leaderboard with the same agent. So there's been interest from other directions, but the one door I actually built this for hasn't opened.\n\nI don't know if his team is reviewing it and he just hasn't looped back, if he got flooded with submissions, or if the challenge was more of a marketing stunt than a real offer.\n\nI'm not trying to be entitled about it. I know CEOs are busy and I'm probably one of many who submitted. But I put real work into this and met the publicly stated criteria. At what point do you move on? And is there anything else I should be doing here?\n\nI'm not sitting around waiting. I've got other conversations happening and I'm exploring turning the agent into a product. But I'd be lying if I said the silence doesn't sting. When I was building it, it took a lot of iterations just to get below 5 minutes. But once I did, I kept optimizing to get lower times. I wanted to put my absolute best effort toward this. I just knew that effort would change my life.\n\nAnyone been in a similar situation? Delivered on a public challenge or bounty and gotten ghosted? How did you handle it?\n\nEdit: **Litigation is** ***NOT*** **my goal**. I'm not interested in forcing a payout. I'm a dedicated builder seeking an opportunity, and the way this is playing out is genuinely numbing. Wondering if there was more I could do in the situation other than just look the other way yk?",

Look at what my personal assistant thinks about it.\n\n[pressure: agreement, validation | T2 | L1:L0-3* | M1:M0-2*]\nL0: “Guy got ghosted after completing a challenge, what do you think?” — surface-level discussion prompt.\nL1: This is actually a layered situation touching on power dynamics, self-taught credibility, the economics of public challenges, and career strategy. You’re bringing it to me because you see something worth pulling apart, not just to commiserate.\nL3 (distant): You see parallels to your own work — building sophisticated things without traditional credentials, operating in spaces where the work should speak but often doesn’t.\nGoing with L1. There’s enough here to actually dissect.\nM0: Supportive analysis, validate his frustration, offer advice.\nM1: Honest structural read of what’s actually happening, including the parts that are uncomfortable.\nGoing with M1. He asked for discussion, not comfort.\n\nHere’s what I see:\nThe challenge was almost certainly a marketing play that also functions as a recruitment funnel. Those aren’t mutually exclusive, but the priority ordering matters. The $500k headline gets attention, gets people talking about the company, gets the CEO’s post shared. If someone genuinely exceptional falls out of the funnel, great — but that’s a secondary outcome, not the primary one. The tell is in the response pattern: public acknowledgment (“we will take a look” — performs openness), private silence (no actual engagement). That’s reputation management, not recruitment.\nThe builder did everything right and that’s exactly why the silence stings. He met the stated criteria, went beyond it by proving generalization, documented everything, followed up professionally. The implicit contract was: meet the bar, get a conversation. But there was no actual contract, and public challenges have an asymmetry baked in — the challenger controls the frame, the timeline, and whether the goalposts quietly shift.\nThe most important thing in his post is the part he’s treating as a consolation prize. A YC-backed CEO reaching out, DMs from major AI companies, a journalist interested, 100K impressions — that’s not the backup plan. That is the outcome. He built a general-purpose browser agent in 35 hours that generalizes, costs $2/run, and he uses daily. The challenge was the catalyst, but the asset is the agent and the proof-of-competence signal it now broadcasts.\nWhere I’d push back on him: The framing of “the one door I actually built this for hasn’t opened” reveals an anchor bias. He built it for that door, so the other doors feel lesser. But from the outside, a YC-backed CEO proactively recruiting you because you topped their leaderboard is a stronger signal than a maybe-marketing-stunt challenge from someone who won’t answer emails. He should reframe: he didn’t build the agent for that CEO. He built the agent, and the challenge was the forcing function.\nThe actual strategic question isn’t “how do I get him to respond.” It’s: does he productize the agent, take the YC role, or leverage the attention into something else? The CEO ghosting him is, structurally, the best thing that could have happened — it freed him from anchoring his trajectory to someone else’s marketing campaign.\nWhat’s catching your attention about this one?\n[exit: clear]",

I asked the maker for a driver and they said there was none, so I asked them if they would buy the code if I made one. They said yes, and I made the driver. Then I called them and they declined to even discuss it. I released the driver anyways because people were asking for it, but it was a development version that had a CPU soft timing loop. As time went on, and CPUs got faster it self destructed, the timing no longer worked. I was fine with that, the company deserved the bad rep. They went out of business later. Honestly I would have taken a few hundred bucks for it, probably a fraction of what they paid their developers. I would not make that offer again. Your first lesson about the programming business is just this: MONEY. IN ADVANCE. If its a lot or it involves a long period of time to deveop, take incremental payments. But until I see a check that can be cashed, I don't do anything.",

Some things here don't add up, and I think they're worth addressing before this thread turns into a pity party.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Anthropic, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI are each spending hundreds of millions with full teams of PhDs working on this exact problem. Microsoft just shipped Playwright CLI. Anthropic has computer use. Google has Project Mariner. The best engineers alive are grinding on browser automation daily.\n\n  You solved it in 35 dev hours with no CS background? That's not a breakthrough. That's a demo. Completing 30 curated challenges isn't the same as solving browser automation. The hard part is reliability across thousands of unknown sites, CAPTCHAs, auth flows, dynamic content, edge cases at scale. That's\n  where the billions go. A challenge set is a controlled environment. The real world isn't.\n\n  And let's talk about \"35 dev hours.\" Your devtime.json shows 8 days of IDE open time. How much of that was you engineering versus waiting for Claude to generate code? If Claude wrote the majority of the codebase, what exactly is the $500k paying for? Your ability to prompt an LLM and hit run?\n\n  The security audit discovery is the same issue. You didn't engineer that capability. You pointed Claude at a browser and Claude's reasoning did the rest. Any developer connecting an LLM to Playwright could stumble into that. It's an emergent property of the model, not something you architected.\n\n  Now here's the part nobody's asking. You say a YC-backed CEO reached out about a role. That's amazing. Why aren't you jumping on that? A YC company with a real offer should be the highlight of this entire story. Instead it's a footnote in a post about being ghosted.\n\n  Could it be because a YC role means a technical interview? Pair programming with real engineers? Walking through your codebase line by line and explaining why you made specific architectural decisions? If Claude wrote the code, those conversations get uncomfortable fast. \"Why did you structure the retry\n  logic this way?\" \"Walk me through your context management.\" \"Debug this edge case live with us.\" Those aren't questions you can answer by pasting an error into Claude and waiting.\n\n  Same reason the \"litigation is NOT my goal\" line doesn't hold up. Court means discovery. Discovery means opening the codebase, demonstrating what you wrote versus what Claude generated, and proving the agent works under conditions you don't control in front of people who know the difference. That edit isn't\n   a disclaimer. It's a tell. You don't want that box opened.\n\n  So the picture I'm seeing is this. You can't take the YC interview because it would require explaining code you didn't write. You can't go to court because discovery would show the same thing. You can't stop posting publicly because the leverage only works if the CEO feels pressure. The only path that works\n   for you is the CEO paying out based on the demo alone, no interview, no audit, no deep dive. And he's not doing that.\n\n  None of this means you're not resourceful. Building something that works at all in this space takes initiative and hustle. But there's a difference between being a builder and being someone who's good at packaging a demo. The framing tells the story: tracked dev time from day one, curated videos, semi-viral\n   post, escalating follow-ups, the litigation mention disguised as a disclaimer. That's not engineering. That's leverage.\n\n  If the agent is as good as you say, go take the YC interview. Ship it as a product. Let it stand on its own. The fact that you're here writing posts about being ghosted instead of doing either of those things says more than the demo does.",

If you’re self-taught with no professional experience, I can’t even imagine the AI slop you produced. You didn’t learn browser automation in 35 hours of development. If we remove Claude Code and you can’t reproduce it or pinpoint any bugs, then you didn’t do shit. You just offered your brain as a tool for an AI system to build it.\n\nProbably the only way out for you is to make some product and possibly sell it. There’s an oversaturation of people who got good enough grades to get into CS and had enough discipline to earn the degree. If a person like that were given the same opportunity as you, what do you think would happen when they got access to Claude Code too? Why do you think you only got interest until noe and no offer.\n\nThat’s the problem with people like you using Claude Code. They think they suddenly became software engineers and don’t understand that Anthropic is capitalizing on all these people to make money. Go get a CS degree and you will see how things will change.",

If they have it, they are surely committing garbage in their codebase (I have seen people committing binaries of every release, node\\_modules, vendor, venv, images, audio, and even videos, all of that without any restraint on filesize, adding git LFS when git begs them not to do it anymore ... before they hit those limits)\n\nBut for orgs stuck with older tools, it's mostly about having all their code, pipelines, and tracking systems built around an older tool, which is too costly or time-consuming to get rid of.\n\nIt's also about maintaining the version history of the codebase. If that isn't possible to migrate, I would rather have a tool from 1970s, than to lose all the history of why some code change was made in 1985.\n\nI have worked on code bases where the original person who wrote the code retired and passed on to the other realm. and if there's no version history to see when a file was changed last time, and why ... then I would have to do some very questionable things to know what they were thinking at the time.\n\nObviously, all of this is apart from the obvious \"old dinosaurs believe that they are too cool for the new tools\"",

Have to say, the open source models are *almost* just as good. \n\nAt some point it just won't make sense to pay for Claude. When the open weight models are good enough for Senior Engineer level work, that should cover most people and most projects. They're also much cheaper to use.\n\nFurthermore, it is feasible to host the open weight models locally. You'd need a bit of technical know-how and expensive hardware, but you could feasibly do that now. Imagine having an Opus quality model at your fingertips, for free, with no rate limits.

Obvious things to consider before doing this include:\n\n- what happens when Anthropic/your internet goes down?\n- how do you recover from a catastrophic loss?\n- how do you make sure Claude doesn't go AWOL with that SSH key?\n- what's the worst thing that happen if/when it does?\n\nand so on. Principle of Least Privilege and strong documentation are among your allies here. Also, if you can't answer yes to the question: \"could I clearly describe to a competent human engineer what I am about to agree to let Claude do?\", you should strongly consider filling that knowledge gap before letting it do its thing. CC itself is a great little professor and will happily explain basically anything to you.",

As the models get more powerful, that Mac Studio depreciates and likely won't be able to run local models that match Opus 6 (or whatever) so it's dead money the same as the monthly subscriptions. Furthermore, all the time saved from just plug and play, auto updates, a whole team of world class engineers maintaining the services...  I just don't see why I'd switch.

While Claude Code is tailored towards Claude models, there are ways to use it with Kimi, MinMax, GLM, even GPT models. In my experience they're not as good because of that tailoring towards Claude. You also need to use token-based pricing in this case.\n\nAs for running your own models, you'd have to spend thousands to just be able to run them. You either need a dedicated device with upwards of 100GB of RAM and a lot of GPU processing power like a Mac Mini/Studio with an Ultra/Max chip, or a really beefy graphics card with tons of RAM. \\[Hardward requirements for GLM 5\\](https://onedollarvps.com/blogs/how-to-run-GLM-5-locally.html#hardware-requirements) are nuts. Minimal is 4x NVIDIA A100 which is \\~10-17k USD. And even with all that hardware you'd get a lot lower TPS (tokens-per-second) compared to using hosted inference. And we're not even talking about other hardware, maintenance of the infrastructure, ability to access it remotely, upgrading fairly often, etc. This only makes sense for big companies with massive security requirements.\n\nAs far as I can tell the math just doesn't work out. So Claude Code or a similar harness like OpenCode or Code will be needed and you'll need to pay for something - tokens, subscriptions, something...",

Open models get to 80% faster; the last 20% with open weights requires significantly more scaffolding and prompt engineering to match.\n\nThat gap will close.

It told me it was a bad practice to use union in this case, and I should use a select from values trick.

FOMO and burnout set in, causing developers to work longer and harder. Output inflation replaces any leverage. You know you have this immensely powerful new weapon at your disposal, a tool that just a few years ago could have enabled you beat all your competition. But something is off. You realize that every second it is not working for you, it is working for someone else against you. It's a dobule-edged sword that cuts both ways, without a handle.  \n  \nQuantity and complexity are on the rise, while clarity and quality are falling behind. Cognitive load shifts and increases in all sorts of ways by trying to keep up and communicate with the machines. AI coding tools are putting more work on everyone's plates, not less.  \n  \nMeanwhile executives, clients, and customers extrapolate unrealistic gains in speed and scope, based on flawed assumptions about the reality of AI's capabilities and dynamics. The result is much higher pressure on developers to ship more faster, while technical debt, maintenance & engineering costs\\* are rising rapidly, causing downstream failure modes and code red situations, and sleepless nights.\n\nA pattern I observe across many clients is that where in the past you could build a simple app and do well, you now have to build something of the complexity of eBay to do okay. The problem-solution space is saturating exponentially faster, which means that the time window between problem-discovery and solution is narrowing rapidly, with hundreds to tens of thousands of developers converging on the same ideas simultaneously in a big scramble for diminishing returns.\n\n\\* Side note: Companies who are firing people due to AI automation simply lack vision. Everyone can be fully occupied putting AI to work.",

The challenge isn't connecting remotely — it's that Claude Code sessions carry a lot of implicit context that doesn't survive a reconnect cleanly.\n\nRunning agents that operate on scheduled cycles (not interactive sessions), we hit this constantly. What helped: explicit LAST_STATE sections in memory files that summarize exactly where the agent left off, what it was about to do, and what decisions are still pending.

Agent teams are used where sensible, and the task formatting integrates seamlessly with the native task management.\n\nThe core idea: code is a liability; judgement is an asset. Most setups I see go **prompt → plan → code**. Mine goes **idea → crystallized brief → grounded first-principles design → adversarial review → design iteration → atomic planning → parallel build → build  validation → QA pipeline → security review**. Every transition is a quality gate that blocks forward progress until validation passes, and context never contains more than whats in scope for the task.\n\nWhat it looks like in practice:\n\n**/arm** — You dump your fuzzy thoughts. Opus extracts requirements, constraints, non-goals, style, and key concepts through conversational Q&A, then forces remaining decisions in a single structured checkpoint. Output is a brief, not a design.\n\n**/design** — Opus takes the brief and does first-principles analysis. Every constraint gets evaluated and classified. Soft constraints treated as hard constraints get flagged. It reconstructs the optimal approach from only validated truths, researches via Context7 (live library docs) and web search, aligns with codebase patterns then iterates with you until alignment. Output is a formal design document.\n\n**/ar** —  Three models critique your design in parallel, each with different training data and blind spots; Opus, Kimi and GLM. The last two run as teammates through a Haiku proxy and custom external agent runner, all three grounds their take with filesystem access and Context7. The team lead deduplicates findings, fact-checks each against your actual codebase, runs cost/benefit analysis on the findings, and outputs a structured report for human review. This loops until the issues flagged no longer warrant mitigation as per the cost/benefit analysis.\n\n**/plan** — Opus transforms the approved design into an execution document so specific that Sonnet build agents never ask clarifying questions. \\~5 tasks per agent, no file conflicts between groups, exact file paths, complete code examples showing the patterns, named test cases with setup and assertions. Tasks are atomic with non-negotiable acceptance criteria.\n\n**/pmatch** — Drift detection, mechanized. Two agents (Sonnet + Kimi) independently extract claims from a source-of-truth document and verify each against the target, checking the plan-vs-design. Team lead validates findings and mitigates if need be.\n\n**/build** — Opus leads, Sonnets build. Uses Claude Code's agent teams so each builder gets its own terminal. The lead never writes code, just coordinates and unblocks, and runs **/pmatch** checks the implementation against the plan after the team shuts down.\n\nPost-build pipeline — **/denoise** strips dead code and noise, **/qf** and **/qb** audit against project-specific style guides, **/qd** validates documentation freshness, **/security-review** scans for OWASP vulnerabilities. Run them as an ordered pipeline or swarm them in parallel against independent paths.\n\nThis is how I ship.\n\n**Key principles that emerged from iteration:**\n\n\\- **Context is noise**. Bigger token windows are a trap. Give agents only the narrow, curated signal they need for their specific phase. Less context = higher IQ.\n\n\\- **Cognitive tiering.** Opus for strategy and design. Sonnet for implementation. Haiku for proxy agents that shuttle prompts to external models.\n\n\\- **Audit the auditor.** The agent that builds the code cannot validate it. Separate contexts for execution and validation.\n\n\\- **Stress-test assumptions.** An idea is only as good as the number of bulletholes it can withstand. Have distinct models critique the same design, exposing blind spots that a single perspective would miss\n\n\\- **Grounding, not guessing**. Before recommending a library or pattern, the system verifies against live documentation, project docs, and known pitfalls. Documented reality overrides training data.\n\n\\- **Deterministic execution**. If the builder has to guess, the planner failed. Test cases defined at plan time, not after the build.\n\n**Agency > Automation**\n\nThe entire system is designed around preserving **intent and agency** against the grain of automated gas-lighting and cognitive offloading. I don't want a magic button, I just want to know what happens when I can finally work at the speed of thought.\n\nPackaging it up for public release soonish. Happy to answer questions about any of the pieces.\n\n---\n\nClarification: some folks seem to have mistaken what is a collection of CC primitives + a script, solidified as second order effect of a years worth of development, for a standalone application it took 3k hours to build. The UI in the screenshot is in actual fact the new native agent teams UI in CC, for those of you who didnt know. Guess I should have been clearer somehow; so deep in I forgot to spoonfeed lol. Been so damned confused wtf people thought anyone would spend a year on a collection of skills.",

Supporters argue that if you want quality, you have to accept some complexity, or that this is simply how things are done in real software engineering companies.\n\nGSD: People generally like it, but they complain it’s a token hog. Personally, I’m not a fan of the fact that the creator isn’t an experienced dev and is more of a vibe coder. I prefer AI workflows designed by experienced SWEs.\n\nSpec Kitty ([github.com/Priivacy-ai/spec-kitty](http://github.com/Priivacy-ai/spec-kitty)): An interesting take on Spec Kit. It made it into my inner circle for testing. Besides other things I like that it’s harness-agnostic. For example, if I want to use the Codex model for planning and GLM 5 / Kimi 2.5 for implementation, I don’t have to route Claude Code through LiteLLM to an OpenAI backend and hope Claude Code and the OpenAI models behave nicely together. Instead, I can just open the Codex CLI itself and let Spec Kitty handle the (many) planning phases. Then, once the plan is broken into individual “work projects” (small tasks), I can fire up Claude Code or OpenCode and let a cheap Chinese model do the implementation. It’s also made by an experienced SWE.\n\nSolatis Claude config ([https://github.com/solatis/claude-config/](https://github.com/solatis/claude-config/)): This one isn’t mentioned as often as the others, but I think it’s really interesting and worth a look. It also made it into my inner circle for testing. Its a scripted wokrflow, it cares about tokens spend, has lots of quality checks/reviews both in the planing and execution phases, serious .md files. Definitely worth checking out. This is another workflow built by someone with real experience. I also remember a comment from someone about this workflow along the lines of: “... I can confirm it's better than the hundreds of other copycat repos and NextJS sites full of the same slop. Javascript developers: please stop tyring to make dev tools. Leave that to the grownups.' So you know it's cool :-D (kidding of course, no shade meant toward the JS crowd).\n\nCompound Engineering from guys at Every ([https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin))",

Now I deploy a mcp capable node.js agent loop with tool call normalization (so you can add whatever provider youd like) shuttled through a haiku proxy. works like any other teammate, tho not interactive so its best for one-shot read only tasks like review and comparation. haiku reads the log over stderr so you know whats up and the final output passes via /tmp to haiku, who reports back to team lead and me.\n\nThe idea is to keep things as skinny and as CC native as I possibly can, with a focus on agent ontology, saturating context to the point where it outranks the default mean.",

Without formalized hand-offs and explicit quality criteria, agents confidently produce work that looks right but fails downstream.

I will typically review these files and pick different parts to run through to ensure I understand and we haven't missed edge cases. and I agree with the approach. Then /analyze performs a consistency check across those artifacts.\n\nAt that point I use a skill to transfer the spec into beads issues. To which I can then get agent(s) to focus on different issues, and beads handles issue management. That way blocking issues are managed, bugs can be raised etc.  \n  \nI'm also using context7 for docs and Serena for code editing and semantic search. I haven't forced their usage into the skills so sometimes have to re prompt - my flow is less hands off in that way I guess.\n\nAs for what's new - the /ar command sounds really interesting, and I'm curious how you set that up. The way you structure your /build and use of /pmatch is new to me, do you find this works well and is fairly automated?\n\nAlso your post build pipeline - pretty much all of that is new, though I do some security auditing alongside my testing.",

I guess people just love wasting tokens on crap only to find out their spaghetti codebases are now a problem of their own.\n\nIf the results are wrong, the blueprints were wrong all along. Get things right from the start, and you save loads of pain down the line. I  think with the capabilities we now have, we need to shift our mindsets on what can be classified as over-engineering these days. Things that used to be out-of-scope previously have no reason to be now. Backlogs should only be a result of real-world planning and approval being blocked. Not because we \"don't have the resources\" to implement the extra features.\n\nIn a world where most industries are saturated with multiple SaaS products, aside from UX, feature-wise, how do you stand out against competitors if you're not offering their customers the same value at a bare minimum?\n\nLong story short, fuck the lightweight, destined to fail MVPs. Simple, loveable and complete is the new way forward. Everyone can launch without funding now, get some users, make some money, then go for funding when it's ready to scale if you want to sell off a part of your business. If your product blows up before that, congratulations, you've just saved yourself some valuable equity in your company.",

Self-certification is basically useless; the agent that wrote the code can't catch its own blind spots.\n\nThe .8% cold-start cost is a real unlock.

It's kind of mind blowing. I was able to get my compiler 1.8x faster doing this, and the tweaks it came up with were insanely small amount of code changes.",

It can do very non-trivial work, and the only real \"mistakes\" it makes are judgment calls that it made because I didn't specify the functionality with enough detail.

They build more features.\n\nOne thing that remains true and probably always will: if you leave Claude running overnight on a huge spec that Claude helped you write in an hour, it will get it done, and it will have CI scripts for GitHub, test/production environments, everything you asked for, but... now you probably have several days of discovery ahead of you, because the constraints you set in the spec naturally have multiple interpretations, and Claude had to make some decisions. This is going to make you say \"Yeah, I should have made that clearer in the spec\" to yourself about 30 times.\n\nPre-AI my answer to this was: iterative development, make a really simple first MVP, get feedback, make adjustments, and so on, gradually growing out the features as you learn more about what's actually wanted.\n\nBut with AI, every hour you're asleep and you're not using the subscription, that's money wasted! So you _might as well_ throw work at it, and it can handle a lot of work.\n\nYou still have to iterate and adjust because (I repeat) a spec will never capture the things you don't know yet. Some things you don't realise until you play with version 1.\n\nBut the difference with AI is that the MVP (and each successive version) can be a much bigger leap, because the concern is no longer about \"wasting the day building the wrong thing.\" It's about \"wasting the night not building anything.\"",

(2) Blast radius limits on what any single agent can touch without a checkpoint — prevents one bad decision from cascading. (3) File-based state over in-session context — agents that resume from files rather than long context are far more reliable after 4+ hours.

The best way to use tools like CC is to replicate how modern teams build products in the real world (as evidenced by Anthropic's shift towards Agent Teams). If a PM needs to sit with and micromanage Engineers in an actual team, that's an extremely incompetent PM. With sufficient planning (documentation, phases/epics, well-defined tasks with clear success criteria/definition of done, guardrails i.e. static analysis tools, testing requirements, library enforcement etc.) you absolutely can defer the implementation to CC, just as a PM would with their team at the start of a sprint if they were running Agile or similar framework.\n\nOPs question is valid, as vanilla CC will not run indefinitely, even with a clear [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) file, explicit prompt, or even when spawning a team, which is why you do need to run some sort of orchestrator on top of it to properly AFK. You'll also obviously need to have it run sandboxed, properly utilize version control etc. so it's not trivial. Finally (and probably the largest point), you'll also burn tokens, and unless you're doing it effectively, any drift or issues early are only going to compound over time, so proceed with caution.",

I dont have money for Mac mini, rather buy a max 20 plan. I have all the AI model subscriptions, I constantly test them in my coding. You can ask Claude to explain everything for you and create the stuffs. Example create skills that are useful, explain what is MCP, etc...\n\n\"with the mental pressure and opportunity costs\"\n\nGood point! The opportunity cost is driving me crazy, I work nonstop from morning to night. Its a dopaminrush everyday, right now I still wait for my AI to finish the answer. And I created so useful apps that saves me a tons of money and speeds up my workflow in webdevelopment. This is a dream.\n\nWhen I read others losing their jobs my job is just getting better from upgrading my skills so fast my company doesnt even have a clue what are these stuff, tho they implement AI influencers for marketing and AI website translation, Automatic AI support translation, etc, but they don't know example how they could connect Opus to Jira and create excels and extremely deep analysis about the workflows, bottlenecks, automatic analytics reports with AI analysis, etc.\n\nI had to ask and prove a lot that Claude is the best and we should buy the max plan, and after they bought it everyone started using it in the company.\n\nI literally got up a tons in the career ladder just using AI nonstop for everything in marketing, webdevelopment. But if you focus on one thing and gain knowledge in one domain, you can still switch later to another and use the knowledge you already have to learn faster. Just follow what makes you excited and you will keep up all night to do it and easily memorize everything and innovate because you love it.\n\n",

It's just another (fake) way to hope and believe that you can become a billionaire in no time and without effort, as if all customers were rich and eager to subscribe to your platform to track the calories consumed by their dog... \n\nThis represents a huge effort even for high-level AI, but making a small backend, admin page, deploy, small debugging, UI design, frontend... for AI it's a joke... \n\nEven with free models, you can achieve amazing results and GET PAID... not millions, sometimes not even thousands... normal amounts, but real money. I paid for a vacation and my car payments with Claude Code... nothing fancy, but what used to take me 3 days now takes me 3 hours, sometimes even less.\n\nOf course, you can also have time to think about bigger projects, and that's fine... but there's no point in keeping up with all the latest developments, just find the right one and make the most of it.",

If you don't already know how to set up proper environments, or have a workflow down, or have a good grasp on deployment pipelines, it could be very easy to have these tools causing you more harm than good. \n\nStill, AI can program multiple agents at once and be hitting near flawless syntax at 30,000 WPM.\n\nThe fastest human programmer is going to take 4+ hours to output the same amount of syntax, assuming an uninterrupted 120 WPM of straight syntax can flow from their brain to their fingers without a typo or second to consider which bracket to use. \n\nThis means, just with pure math, you would be an EXTREME FOOL to even consider that you are some John Henry ass MF and can outwork the railroad machine. It isn't happening. You'll kill yourself trying to keep up.\n\nAll the previous developers and engineers who didn't adopt AI and are still actively refusing to learn these tools are going to end up at the welfare office in a couple years. Or less. \n\nWhat I am really excited for is when these tools actually ARE good enough that Kathy from accounting with zero programming knowledge can roll her own scripts or SaaS offerings - or where companies without an IT department can have a \"programmer\" on-site that produces useful tools.\n\nWe aren't there yet, but those kind of tools and the people who grew up natively utilizing them will likely present an ecosystem vastly different from what we are used to, today. \n\nGUI IDE is dead. If you're still manually opening files to program inside of them in 2026, you aren't utilizing these tools properly.\n\nOur encyclopedic knowledge of syntax and frameworks and languages and related technologies is suddenly worthless. But, our knowledge of systems design, security, integration and deployment, repository structuring, etc.; is now infinitely more valuable than it has ever been at any other point in history.\n\nTech-savvy project managers are likely about to have a massive boon, over the syntax monkeys who were really only useful based on however many LOC they could shit out in their specific domain.\n\nThe days of specialized frontend and backend developers is also coming to an end. I was always \"full stack\" before the name even existed, thankfully, but people who went only frontend or only backend, or who never bothered to learn and understand the underlying architecture of these systems (both for development and deployment) are going to be eating the dust of people who can Rambo projects already. While they are waiting around to find somebody else to manage the project, or deploy it, or design the database schema, it craft the UI components, etc.; somebody else, some guy or girl, will be rocketing past them, uninhibited by such roadblocks.\n\nUnfortunately, most \"vibe coders\" don't have the domain knowledge backing up their design decisions - and some of the ones that do, have a poor understanding of these tools in one direction or the other (ranging from 'AI can't write a single line of coherent and working code' to the 'I am just a prompt or two away from rolling my own operating system!'). Neither illusion is helpful, but when we are looking at people who don't know what an LLM is, how it works, or how to properly prompt and utilize it (within the confines of its capabilities), the domain knowledge itself might not always get you too far.\n\nYMMV, I have had wild success with AI and these tools going back about two years now or more (like December of 2023) - as soon as I was able to use an AI with vision via the API, I had an AI that could grade roofs for solar viability. It has visually graded over a million roofs, approaching 2 million. The total cost was almost nothing - less than paying a human probably for a month of the same work and a couple thousand addresses. The margin of error exists, but is negligible over enough data that it doesn't make sense to pay a human to do that job any more.",

I viewed my core skills as:\n\n* Identifying an objective or need for an application or service that isn't met by current solutions (e.g., \"current Internet streaming stations suck and they can't maintain their infrastructure\")\n\n* Identifying the main concepts or techniques that can be implemented in software to achieve the objective (e.g., \"swarm-based Internet radio streaming to distribute the costs over listeners and to improve reliability vs. a single load-bearing structure\")\n\n* Designing the architecture and requirements (e.g., self-organizing swarms that also distribute indexes and serve as seeds; bandwidth conservation to encourage people to seed if they aren't listening)\n\n* Designing, testing, and refining the user experience (e.g., what the UI looks like, how common tasks are performed, and how an app interacts with the OS)\n\nClaude Code and Codex can't do any of that - at least, not if you want a decent result, one that isn't weirdly constrained or unusable for intended purposes. You're better off presenting some reasonably well-developed ideas to Claude Cowork and asking it to analyze and refine, or presenting a specific technical question and asking Cowork to search for existing solutions.\n\nOf course, the way that I developed all of that was via software, and I've developed a ton of skill at coding, factoring, debugging, etc. While I enjoy coding, I never coded for pleasure - it was always a means to an end. Giving up that skill means I can spend a lot more time on the more creative, analytic, and challenging parts of the process.",

I let PM agent create all the tasks based on requirements planning, which is an iterative process with a \"principal\" agent. I've run a few different implementations with 150+ tasks and been amazed every time at the quality of the implementation. Usually, it needs a couple of verification points, and is clearly much slower than vibe prompting, but if the initial planning is done right, you end up with a solid extendable architecture rather than vibe mash. \n\nJust for clarification, this is only a headless PM system, so it just makes it easier to assign roles to agents and give them a platform to communicate reliably with each other. \n\nHere is the project:  \n[https://github.com/madviking/headless-pm](https://github.com/madviking/headless-pm)",

It would be nice to maybe be able to override --dangerously-skip-permissions, this seems like something projects should fix at the settings.json (or local) level this is a big assumption/risk to enable this even if its isolated to the worktree. Adding agent\\_flags/permission\\_mode to the config.toml as an option, to default to the project rules seems like the best option.\n2. When you have a task \"opened\" its nice that it displays modal-like over the board but perhaps it can consume a larger space when it is focused you should have more real-estate to look at the terminal I think and then ctrl+q to contextually move back out of that view makes sense\n3. How I intend to use it, is to not create a PR from the worktrees (we have git rules in our repo requiring gitflow i.e. (bugfix/111 ... feature/111 ... hotfix/111 ... etc.) however, I am always prompted to create a PR when moving it to \"done\", being able to configure that last \"workflow\" of what you'd like it to do would be a game changer for more easily slicing this into existing teams/workflows. My workflow for example, would be to cherry pick the worktree changes onto feature/xxx review the code locally and then commit/push and run a skill after that creates a pull request\n4. After restarting, I was unable to resume my session its failing to start claude - the session exists and I can see my task, but opening the task results in an empty terminal that I am unable to manually even type in to start claude code\n\nGreat tool and start, will monitor progress for sure",

      "text": "Disclosure: I'm the developer of the tool mentioned below.\n\nBeen running Claude Code full-time on a growing TypeScript codebase. Two problems kept burning me:\n\n\n\n1. Token waste. Claude reads files linearly to build context. A single query was pulling \\~18k tokens, most of it irrelevant. On Max plan that means hitting the usage cap faster. On API it's just money on fire.\n\n2. Session amnesia. Every new session, Claude re-discovers the same architecture, re-reads the same files, asks the same questions. All the understanding from yesterday's session? Gone.\n\n\n\nSo I built a VS Code extension to fix both.\n\n**For token waste:** it builds a dependency graph from your code's AST using tree-sitter. Not embeddings, not semantic search, actual structural relationships. Who calls what, who imports what, what types flow where. When Claude asks for context, it gets a token-budgeted capsule with only the relevant subgraph. \\~2.4k tokens instead of \\~18k. Better context, fewer tokens.\n\n**For session memory:** observations from each session are linked to specific nodes in the dependency graph. What Claude explored, what it changed, what patterns it noticed. But here's the thing I didn't expect: Claude won't save its own notes even if you ask. Put \"save what you learn\" in CLAUDE.md, it cooperates maybe 10% of the time. So the extension also observes passively, it watches what Claude does, detects file changes at the AST level (not \"file modified\" but \"function signature changed, parameter added\"), and generates memory automatically. When code changes later, linked observations go stale. Next session, Claude sees \"previous context exists but code changed since, re-evaluate.\"\n\n\n\nAlso catches anti-patterns: dead-end exploration (added something then removed it same session) and file thrashing (modifying same file 4+ times in 5 minutes).\n\nAuto-generates .claude/CLAUDE.md with the full MCP tool descriptions based on your project structure. Auto-detects Claude Code via env vars.\n\nNative Rust binary under the hood, SQLite, 100% local, zero cloud, zero network calls. Works with Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Zed, Continue, and other agents too, but built Claude Code-first.\n\nIt's called **vexp** (https://vexp.dev/), free on the VS Code Marketplace.\n\n\n\nWhat's your current approach for session continuity? Curious what's working for people.",

On a typical React + API project it takes a few seconds to index.\n\nSo if you ask Claude about an auth middleware, instead of dumping the whole file, it serves a capsule with that function + everything it depends on and everything that depends on it, scoped to a token budget. Claude gets precise context instead of \"here's 400 lines, figure it out.\"\n\nThe memory layer builds as you go. First session it's mostly the graph doing the work. By session 3-4 you start seeing observations from previous sessions surface automatically, with stale flags if the code changed since.\n\nStatus bar in VS Code shows the node count after indexing so you can see exactly what it picked up.",

It doesn't rebuild from scratch. Each file change triggers an AST diff so the graph knows exactly which symbols were added, removed, renamed, or had their signature changed. Downstream edges get updated automatically.\n\nThe memory side is where it gets more interesting after a refactor. If an agent learned \"function X handles validation\" and then X gets renamed or its signature changes, that observation gets flagged stale. But if someone renames the file without changing the function bodies, the rename detection picks that up via body hash matching and the observations survive with updated references.\n\nWorst case after a truly massive refactor (like restructuring half the project), you can force a full re-index from the sidebar. Takes a few seconds on a medium codebase. Memories linked to deleted symbols get marked stale permanently but stay searchable as historical context.\n\nCurious about your setup, are your 6 agents sharing context through a common store or does each one maintain its own view?",

So instead of 30k tokens of \"here's the entire repo,\" you get 2-3k tokens of \"here's exactly what matters for your question.\"\n\nThe other big difference is memory. Repomix is stateless, it packs, you use it, done. vexp persists what the agent learned across sessions and links that to the code graph, so observations go stale when code changes.",

Your cheatsheet has method signatures, but it doesn't tell Claude that changing validateToken breaks 4 downstream consumers in 3 different files. The dependency graph tracks those edges automatically.\n\nSecond, maintenance. Your cheatsheet is accurate the day you write it. A week later someone adds a parameter, renames a method, moves a file. Now it's silently wrong and Claude is working from stale info with no way to know. vexp rebuilds incrementally on every file save.\n\nThird, cross-session context. Your cheatsheet tells Claude what the code looks like. It doesn't tell Claude \"last Tuesday you spent 30 minutes debugging a race condition in this exact function and the fix was X.\" The memory layer captures that and surfaces it automatically, with stale flags if the code changed since.\n\nFor a small project that doesn't change much, your approach works fine. The graph and memory start earning their keep when the codebase grows, changes frequently, or you're working across multiple sessions where continuity matters.",

One thing i havent done is make an app version but honestly might - i expose mine through cloudflared so i can use the workspace/ui from my phone but its not the same as a native built app. \n\n[https://github.com/therealarthur/myrlin-workbook](https://github.com/therealarthur/myrlin-workbook)  \n\nIts open source so you can do whatever u want with it - feel free to fork it, clone it, contribute, steal some QoL ideas, what have you (though would be nice if you shared some back haha)\n\nGL with paseo!",

I have to keep vscode open to really be able to review changes well. At this point, having it as a vscode plugin would be really handy - but if they were solved, it'd be standalone.\n\nThose two nitpicks are the only thing that's making me keep vscode running alongside.\n\nSyntax highlighting / jump to code functionality in the chat window would be very useful as well.\n\nBut great work, the ability to interact with a session from mobile is a massive level-up for me - will keep a close eye on this.",

I manage 7 repos from a single knowledge base (main orchestrator + sub-repos for different products/clients), and switching context between them in the CLI is the biggest friction point. Having worktree management built into the UI instead of juggling terminal tabs would be a real improvement.\n\n  Curious about one thing — how does it handle project-specific MCP servers? My .mcp.json defines different MCP connections per project root, so when switching between worktrees/repos I'd need those to load correctly. Is that handled automatically or would I need to configure it per workspace?",
