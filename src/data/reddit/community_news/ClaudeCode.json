      "text": "1 year ago I posted \"12 lessons from 100% AI-generated code\" that hit 1M+ views. Some of those points evolved into agents.md, claude.md, plan mode, and context7 MCP. This is the 2026 version, learned from shipping products to production.\n\n**1- The first few thousand lines determine everything**\n\nWhen I start a new project, I obsess over getting the process, guidelines, and guardrails right from the start. Whenever something is being done for the first time, I make sure it's done clean. Those early patterns are what the agent replicates across the next 100,000+ lines. Get it wrong early and the whole project turns to garbage.\n\n**2- Parallel agents, zero chaos**\n\nI set up the process and guardrails so well that I unlock a superpower. Running multiple agents in parallel while everything stays on track. This is only possible because I nail point 1.\n\n**3- AI is a force multiplier in whatever direction you're already going**\n\nIf your codebase is clean, AI makes it cleaner and faster. If it's a mess, AI makes it messier faster. The temporary dopamine hit from shipping with AI agents makes you blind. You think you're going fast, but zoom out and you actually go slower because of constant refactors from technical debt ignored early.\n\n**4- The 1-shot prompt test**\n\nOne of my signals for project health: when I want to do something, I should be able to do it in 1 shot. If I can't, either the code is becoming a mess, I don't understand some part of the system well enough to craft a good prompt, or the problem is too big to tackle all at once and needs breaking down.\n\n**5- Technical vs non-technical AI coding**\n\nThere's a big difference between technical and non-technical people using AI to build production apps. Engineers who built projects before AI know what to watch out for and can detect when things go sideways. Non-technical people can't. Architecture, system design, security, and infra decisions will bite them later.\n\n**6- AI didn't speed up all steps equally**\n\nMost people think AI accelerated every part of programming the same way. It didn't. For example, choosing the right framework, dependencies, or database schema, the foundation everything else is built on, can't be done by giving your agent a one-liner prompt. These decisions deserve more time than adding a feature.\n\n**7- Complex agent setups suck**\n\nFancy agents with multiple roles and a ton of .md files? Doesn't work well in practice. Simplicity always wins.\n\n**8- Agent experience is a priority**\n\nTreat the agent workflow itself as something worth investing in. Monitor how the agent is using your codebase. Optimize the process iteratively over time.\n\n**9- Own your prompts, own your workflow**\n\nI don't like to copy-paste some skill/command or install a plugin and use it as a black box. I always change and modify based on my workflow and things I notice while building.\n\n**10- Process alignment becomes critical in teams**\n\nDoing this as part of a team is harder than doing it yourself. It becomes critical that all members follow the same process and share updates to the process together.\n\n**11- AI code is not optimized by default**\n\nAI-generated code is not optimized for security, performance, or scalability by default. You have to explicitly ask for it and verify it yourself.\n\n**12- Check git diff for critical logic**\n\nWhen you can't afford to make a mistake or have hard-to-test apps with bigger test cycles, review the git diff. For example, the agent might use created\\_at as a fallback for birth\\_date. You won't catch that with just testing if it works or not.\n\n**13- You don't need an LLM call to calculate 1+1**\n\nIt amazes me how people default to LLM calls when you can do it in a simple, free, and deterministic function. But then we're not \"AI-driven\" right?\n\nEDIT: Your comments are great, they're inspiring which points I'll expand on next. I'll be sharing more of these insights on [X](https://x.com/QaisHweidi) as I go.",

I run a multi-agent setup where each agent role (coder, designer, QA, etc.) gets its own .md file with role-specific instructions, and there's a hierarchy — project-level CLAUDE.md for shared rules, then agent-level overrides. The first few hundred lines of those instruction files determined whether agents would produce coherent work or chaos.\n\nOne thing I'd add: codify your failures, not just your patterns. Every time an agent makes a mistake that wastes time, I add a specific rule to prevent it. My CLAUDE.md has entries like \"NEVER use threshold-based black removal — destroys internal outlines\" because an agent did it once and wrecked a batch of designs. Those negative rules are often more valuable than the positive ones because they prevent the exact class of mistake LLMs love to repeat.",

I often do these as stream-of-conscious dictations and have Claude organize them.\nCompeting approaches - Ask Claude for 3 approaches, evaluated against a matrix (performance, complexity, cost, etc.). You can shape these however you want. We used to do this via brainstorms or hackathons, then compare via matrix. With Claude you can probe and reason through framing just as easily. The approaches are usually the easy part.\nTrade-off review - Claude walks you through each approach against the matrix, teaches you the pros/cons. This part can go slow if you’re patient enough to really work the plans. The cognitive load from sheer review volume is real.\nSolution design - Traditional planning kicks off for the chosen approach, ultimately getting me to interface-level designs for stuff I wasn’t previously opinionated about.\nThese cycles take me about 8 hours from problem statement to deployed software. It’s addictive, honestly. I’m doing what used to take 3-5 people a month, in a single day. Over and over. If you know how to build software, there’s never been a better time to build something.",

I’ve been building production software (high throughput APIs) for the last 13 months with AI and using less and less manual coding till Codex-5.2 and Opus/Sonnet 4.5, when I finally started doing full AI output. I can say that all your points sound like my words so I’m quite happy I’m on track. I don’t do parallel agents on the same branch yet, I prefer to parallelize features instead, but it’s something I’ll start doing now, especially with agent teams. \n\nNumber 12 is so real, there’s probably a trait in LLMs to use fallbacks in everything. We should be able to turn that down and have real early throw convention implemented.\n\nNumber 1 is law. Relates to #8 also. Over time I changed my architecture to fit the agent better. Real gains. My turns used to take 15min for a feature, down to 7 now.\n\nNumber 4 was my test strategy also, now I get a feature in 1 shot quite often, with 2 or 3 extra turns when the models are on those days.\n\nNumber 7 is absolute truth. I started with PRD generators and now I have a couple of basic MDs and get it working much better. But gotta consider that the models evolved a lot in the last 9 months.\n\nNumber 10 is a nightmare for other teams, but I work alone so I’m just blessed I guess.\n\nAnyways, I could tell 10 war stories on each of the points you raised here but I’ll digress.\n\nGood writing, saving here as this looks like something I’d write if my ass wasn’t that lazy.",

Usually both.\n\n  \nThe thing I would add is that 1 and 12 feed into each other more than people realize. If your early patterns are clean (point 1), then your git diffs stay small and readable (point 12). When diffs start getting noisy with unrelated changes, that is the first sign your foundation is drifting. I have caught subtle bugs that way, things like the agent silently swapping a UUID lookup for a name-based one because the naming was ambiguous. Looked correct at first glance but would have blown up in prod.\n\n  \nAlso strongly agree on 7. I went through a phase of writing elaborate multi-agent orchestration with specialized roles and honestly the simple setup of one well-configured [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) plus focused prompts beats it every time for solo work.

      "text": "# \n\nClaude Code just shipped Agent Teams, and it's not just \"sub-agents with a nicer name.\" It's a completely different execution model where 3–5 independent Claude Code instances can actually collaborate on the same project, share context, exchange messages, and coordinate through a shared task system.\n\nI spent way too long digging through logs and filesystem changes to understand how this actually works under the hood. Turns out it's pretty different from the old task tool, and there are specific situations where Agent Teams are legitimately better than spinning up regular sub-agents.\n\n**The Big Difference**\n\n**Old sub-agent model:** Main agent calls task tool, sub-agent spins up, works in isolation, session terminates, only a summary comes back.\n\n**New Agent Teams model:** Shared task lists, direct messaging between agents, explicit lifecycle control (startup, shutdown). Agents can coordinate, debate, and update each other in real time instead of just working in silos.\n\n# How It Actually Works\n\nBehind the scenes, Agent Teams use five new internal tools:\n\n**TeamCreate** – Sets up the team scaffolding (creates a folder under `.claude/teams/`)\n\n**TaskCreate** – Adds tasks as JSON files with status tracking, dependencies, and ownership (this is different from the old Task tool, it's specifically for creating todos)\n\n**Task tool (upgraded)** – Still spins up agents, but now supports `name` and `team_name` params to activate team mode instead of simple sub-agent mode\n\n**taskUpdate** – Agents use this to claim tasks, update status, mark things done\n\n**sendMessage** – The real unlock. Supports direct messages (agent to agent) and broadcasts (agent to all teammates). Messages get written to `.claude/teams/<team_id>/inbox/` and injected into each agent's conversation history as `<teammate-message teammate_id=\"...\">`.\n\nTeam-lead can send a `shutdown_request`, teammates confirm with `shutdown_response`, and sessions terminate cleanly.\n\n**When Agent Teams Are Actually Worth It**\n\nThe best use case so far: deep debugging with multiple hypotheses.\n\nExample from the official docs: users report the app exits after one message instead of staying connected. Spawn five agent teammates to investigate different theories. Have them talk to each other, try to disprove each other's ideas like a scientific debate, and update a findings doc with whatever consensus emerges.\n\nThat kind of collaborative, multi-angle investigation is way harder to pull off with isolated sub-agents that only report back summaries.\n\n**How to Set Up Agent Teams**\n\n**Step 1: Update Claude Code to latest version**\n\n**Step 2: Enable the experimental flag**\n\nOpen your settings file:\n\n    code ~/.claude/settings.json\n\nAdd this to the global settings:\n\njson\n\n    {\n      \"env\": {\n        \"CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS\": \"1\"\n      }\n    }\n\nSave the file and restart your terminal.\n\n**Step 3: Start a new Claude Code session**\n\nAgent Teams activate when your prompt explicitly asks Claude Code to create a team. For example:\n\n\"I'm designing a CLI tool that helps developers track TODO comments across their codebase. Create an agent team to explore this from different angles: one teammate on UX, one on technical architecture, one playing devil's advocate.\"\n\n**Pro tip: Use tmux or iTerm2 for the best experience**\n\nAgent Teams shine when you can see every agent working in parallel.\n\n**For iTerm2 (macOS):**\n\n1. Install iTerm2\n2. Go to Settings → General → Magic\n3. Enable Python API\n4. Restart iTerm2\n5. Launch Claude Code with: `claude --teammate-mode tmux`\n\nThis opens one pane for the team lead and separate panes for each agent teammate. You can click into any pane, watch what the agent is doing live, and even send direct messages to individual agents.\n\nFor a full walkthrough with logs, internal tool traces, and more examples of when Agent Teams outperform sub-agents, check out the [full breakdown](https://vibecodecamp.blog/blog/how-to-install-and-use-claude-code-agent-teams-reverse-engineered) ",

                  "text": "Well, the metric always has to be tokens burn to accomplish the goal.  That's harder to judge, especially if agents working in isolation don't accomplish the goal.\n\nI've seen other people mention using a direct message style inter-agent communication\nThat they were creating direct message like communications between subagents.  \n\nLast fall I tried it and had a team of six subagents do a \"feasibility study\" for building a high speed computer board design.  \nEssentially, it's a complex system design with multiple subsystems that had competing requirements.  Could they work together, reason with each other toward a common goal, yet make trade-offs when required?\nI was blown away by how well it worked with so few instructions.\n\nA simple orchestrator agent (project manager) managed them, gave them their individual assignments.  The tasking was broken up like it would really be broken up on an engineering team.  They were trying to meet high level system specs, which had flowdown requirements for individual subsystems assigned to an agent (high speed signaling/communications, memory design, power delivery, board stack up, mechanical/thermal, etc).  They each picked subcomponents by themselves with no guidance and used combined spec sheets of many parts to determine subsystem performance.  \n\nI used a simple shared message board- a file- that they all wrote to.  PM sent coordination messages as group broadcasts. Subsystem agents could broadcast or address individual subagents with questions in TO:   FROM: format.   \n\nI was really impressed as hell with how it played out. How easy it is to forget that a sub agent is really smart.  They didn't just download a spec sheet, they picked popular parts commonly used in computer systems that would meet the specs for this computer.   They also researched expected part availability and potential supply chain disruption- such as parts that were sourced only from taiwan.  \n\nExample 1:  thermal sub might ask high speed comm sub what his power consumption tally was for each communication chip, so it could watch for excessive power density that couldn't be cooled.  That depended on the chip it selected and what speed it operated at.  \nWhy ask?  Because one sub shared info about temperature sensitivity of memory parts.  So the thermal guy was tracking power density a hesitability to cool it.  The high-speed guy would I either tell them the answer or say, I'll have to get back with you.  And they always followed up.\n\nWhat's so intriguing is that i dont recall giving them detailed instructions on how to coordinate.  I gave some generic instructions to the PM and PM set the ground rules for everyone.  I just gave them the ability to message, and that's what they actually did. Anyone in engineering would recognize the type of back and forth communication instantly.\n\nSeeing how they respond to failure is interesting.  They hit a couple of design points that were too aggressive.  Subsystems couldn't hit their target or even make trade offs to hit their target.  The project manager just chimed in after a struggle and made an executive decision to downscope some requirements, but still matt most of their requirement. That released the log jam that was holding up progress.  Again, that wasn't an instruction I gave.  They just took initiative.\n\nIf you do this with software design, you're probably familiar with the problem of subagent, staying in their own lane.\nBut it worked and they politely messaged each other about specs and behaviors that they were dependent on and did not try to conduct their own research.  Maybe they did some secret side research, but I wasn't aware it.\n\nOverall, it demonstrated pretty good coordination and cooperation between different agents in charge of subsystem design, under the guidance of a project manager.  \n\nWhether you do software design or computer design, you probably recognize all the same elements of coordination, trade off inspects, working toward what's a common goal, etc\nBut it gave some really insightful analyses about the capabilities of subagents to work in teams.  \n\nI'm excited to see how the subagent Teams concept plays out.",

Regular SSH drops your session the second your network hiccups, which is painful when you have 3-5 agents running in parallel and one of them needs your approval to proceed.\n\n  \nThis is actually the exact problem that got me to build Moshi (an iOS terminal app). I was running agent teams on my dev machine and kept losing SSH sessions when checking on them from my phone. The whole point of agent teams is they work autonomously, but they still need you for approvals and unblocking. Being able to jump into any tmux pane from your phone and approve something means the team doesnt sit idle for hours while you are away from your laptop.\n\n  \nAlso for anyone setting this up, make sure your [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) is solid before spawning a team. Each teammate reads it independently, so any vague instructions get amplified across multiple agents.

It automates how *I* use Claude. i.e. it has access to coding agents. It freely spawns agents to write investigations, implementation, reviews, kills them, starts up the next one with the right references by using a tmux type function. All in tmux panes I control. \nNo message system beyond that. \n\nI can instantly tweak the scaffolding with the phrase \"next time do X\". \nIt can automate the repetitive tasks I do while using claude (plan, refine, impl, review) \n\n\nI might give teams a try next week, but i'm going to go out on a limb and bet teams is the wrong way.

Less context is more. \n\nTLDR: The part where they inject the concepts of `team` via a param name like `team_name` is the wrong abstraction, and inter team messaging seems extremely dumb.",

I'm not sure what has happened, the quality is generally still very high but the usage limits have become absolutely beyond a joke, basically unusably restrictive.\n\nI can code on GPT 5.3 Extra High for hours on end without a single thing getting in my way but I can give Claude one reasonably complex prompt and by the time it is done, I have used about 50-70% of my 5h limit. Two prompts and I'm done, 2 days and that's it for the week.\n\nAm I the only one that has noticed an absolutely huge difference in what you can get done within your subscription tier lately?",

I let claude and codex review each other afterwards. Maybe a bit wasteful, but i see it as an experiment. After a handful of these runs, codex has won everytime. Both claude and codex reflect on codex as the better implementation, more complete, better plan adherence and less bugs. \n\nSo based on this it seem a no brainer to leave claude behind for now, but somehow it feels like a big leap. 5x plan has been so good for me",

Small atomic tasks burn way fewer tokens because the model doesn't go on extended thinking tangents.\n\n  \nThe other big shift for me was going async. I'll kick off a task, go do something else, come back when it's done. I actually built a mobile app (Moshi) partly because of this exact pain point. I wanted to check on my agents and approve stuff from my phone instead of sitting at my desk watching Claude think for 3 minutes. The mosh protocol keeps the connection alive even when you switch networks so you never come back to a dead session.\n\n  \nBetween smaller prompts and not babysitting every session, I went from burning through my weekly limit in 2 days to making it last most of the week.

Token usage is only slightly higher - about 10-15%, but the usage from the five-hour quota has jumped by 60-70% or more.\n\n\n\nI was never hitting the five-hour limit before, and now I'm consistently hitting it on less than 30% of the work I was doing before. Claude is definitely one of the best models.",

I've been experimenting with injecting a persistent dependency map at session start so Claude already knows the project structure.

It’s pretty popular too, lots of people using it. And you wanna know what I didn’t see? A post about hammers every other post! So why don’t nail gun fans go circlejerk about it over there instead of spamming the hammer Reddit with a bunch of shilling. Because if I wanted to read about fucking nail guns all day, I would be following the nail gun subreddit.\n\n  \n",

This year marks my 20th year in the business.\n\nSome prominent people are already comparing writing code by hand with \"assembly line work\". I'm reading articles/tweets where Google, Microsoft, Anthropic and OpenAI engineers claim they don't write code anymore, that everything is written by AI. But of course because these are also the companies earning millions through these models, this could also be marketing fluff.\n\nThough, today I spoke someone working at some big corporate high tech company and he told me the same thing, they we even allowed to burn through as many tokens as they like, no limits. He told me his colleagues are now solely reviewing code created by agents, basically what those AI companies tell us.\n\nAs someone who's really good at his craft, I have a high standard for code quality. Sure, claude/gemini/openai can generate scripts doing stuff I couldn't image 5 minutes ago in 1 minute. Really impressive and unreal. But I also find myself discarding lots of code because it's not the best way to do it, or it's not what I asked for. Maybe I need to get better at prompting, anyway.\n\nWhat I wanted to learn is what your experience is as a senior software engineer working at a startup, scale-up or fortune 500 company. Is this really where we're heading at?\n\n",

See what it can do, and if you’re not sure, ask Claude or go look up how other people are doing it on YouTube. (Maybe you want to learn about agents or skills, for example.)\n\nI’d suggest starting off by building things up, one by one. Start with making some specialized agents that you manually call, then wire those up as subagents and have a coordinating “orchestrator” call those subagents. Finally try out some of the “looping” or “agent team/swarm” tools. I only say to go through these levels one by one, just so you can understand how they build on top of each other.\n\nIf you want some examples of agent files, I open sourced the collection of agents I made for GitHub Copilot: https://github.com/ShepAlderson/copilot-orchestra\n\nThey aren’t “perfect” for Claude, but they are very close. Would need some tweaks for things like tools or such, but Claude itself can do a great job “converting” these to agent files for itself. Maybe give that a try and see what you can do with it.",

Once you know what you need, then look for existing tools.\n\n2/ What surprised me: this led to better code, not just more code. As a lead, I've shipped countless rushed features with technical debt. AI unlocks a tireless workforce for all that \"good but tedious\" work we'd normally skip. Today a colleague needed a long but simple refactor—a year ago we'd have ignored it. Done, without breaking a stride.\n\n3/ The mental space freed from menial work is massive. You focus on design, trade-offs, and architecture. You can choose better options that would've been \"too much work.\"\n\nTry a constraint: don't write a line of code yourself for a week. See what happens.",

Many talk about AI taking jobs and, while that may be true, the more nuanced (and hopefully correct statement) is that it’s reshaping how we do our jobs. Perhaps the days of painfully typing each line of syntax are gone as we shift towards shaping the specifications and generating the code.\n\nHere’s an interesting angle that’s less talked about as well- LLMs are trained on data released under different licenses. The generated code may be close enough to the original source that the owners may claim its subject to their licensing terms. My company explicitly disallows the use of AI on externally released products for this reason. It’ll be interesting to see how the legal aspects of this are addressed over time.\n\nPoint is, I think there will always be a need for people to write (or manage the generation of) code but how many engineers are required and how they work may drastically change. At least this is what I tell myself so I can sleep at night for now :)",

Claude without this is a lot worse. It doesn't know where to look in big monorepos and really struggles. Microservice repos it breezes through... As long as you don't have giant thousand line files - it seems to struggle a lot with editing large files. \n\nBiggest help is telling it where to put the change and doing one change a time. So if for example I want to update my client library for an API because I wrote new endpoints, then I have it generate swagger docs from comments in the codebase then have it use the swagger doc to update the client library in x folder to support the new doc. This is two calls to Claude one to make the doc and another to use it for a work product. If I have it do both it can goof up. \n\nClaude fails like once every 25 tasks when I use it this way which is better than most engineers. I also know other coworkers who really struggle getting good output and I'm not sure why their experience is so much worse than mine.",

I don't see myself ever going back to \"writing code by hand.\" \n\nMany disagree but for anyone to think that this is not the future of software engineering I don't see it. I hear a lot of people saying all kinds of crazy things about AI, but if you ignore what is online, use the latest and greatest models available and put the time into developing the skill, and even more importantly changing your mindset, traditional software engineering no longer exists. \n\nWith that said, I as a software engineer with 11 years of experience am far more effective and can do things that \"vibe coders\" cannot. People naively assume that all we do is \"write code\" whereas code is the end product of what we actually do and that is think hard, deeply, problem solve, research, breakdown complex problems into smaller pieces, etc. \n\nTo be completely honest with you, I feel like I genuinely have super powers now. I have built apps that would have taken me an a team of highly skilled engineers months in days... many times over. ",

I never will be in that vibe coding camp of trust it implicitly. But I also have decades of experience to fall back on in knowing what to look for when reviewing it's work. But I will say so far I have been very impressed with the help it has given me. Any time I ask it to do something, it's gotten me no less than 90% of the way to a final product. And that has not just been coding, it's been documentation tasks, and I've been giving Claude cowork some things to do at home. \n\nI'm having to actively think in a way to give it things to do - that's the biggest change for me so far, and finding that balance between when to do it myself versus when to ask it for help will come in time. I also set major guardrails on it, i tell it that it cannot commit anything, so there is always fallback places set up. And sometimes I simply use plan mode just to generate a to-do list for a task and then do it myself. \n\nI'm glad I waited through the period of early adoption and let others work the initial kinks out, but for me at least, all the positive press claude has been getting seems warranted. \n\nI think us experienced senior devs aren't going anywhere. Because what we have that AI does not and will not have any time soon is an understanding of the \"why\" part of coding. What's the business logic behind it, why are decisions being made that result in us having to write these tools and features. Combine that with experienced eyes that can review the work of AI tools and decide if it's correct or not. \n\nJunior devs? That's another story. I would hate to be a newbie in this day and age, because they are going to have to learn just as we did, there is no replacement for experience, but at the same time stay on top of the changes in tools, and remember these are TOOLS.",

          "text": "I’ve been in the industry about 15 years, and yeah, it’s been a big shift. It feels on the magnitude of infrastructure as code or the shift from colocation to cloud.\n\nI would say I use agents for about 90% of my code, similar to others who answered here. I remember when I first realized that agents could write code almost as well as me (thinking back to the Sonnet 4 days, and even a bit of the Sonnet 3.7 days, though less so). I had a few months of deep existential crisis, and feared I needed to hurry up and skill up into a trade that’s more physical and not connected to “knowledge work”. I was feeling deeply “left behind” and had attached so much of my self worth to my ability to produce working and efficient code.\n\nIt was when I realized that agentic tools are just that, tools, that I kinda snapped out of it and dug in. I heard someone say “It’s not AI that will replace you, it’s the engineer who knows how to use AI that will”, and that really stuck with me and lit a fire under my ass. I will be the engineer who knows how to use AI.\n\nI really dug in, spending my off hours to push the boundaries and try new things. While I’m not yet permitted to use all the tools at work yet, I’m practicing on my own projects and slowly my company is making progress with allowing us to use agentic tools. What we’re seeing is that the senior devs who have been in it with building and running the product, are the ones seeing the most benefit. Anecdotally, the “architect” folks are actually having a harder time with it. They have gotten so used to staying so high level that they don’t realize how much goes into breaking down goals and tasks into work people/agents can do, never mind the fact they haven’t actually touched code in years. Juniors are one area I don’t have direct vision into, as my team currently doesn’t have anyone below about an “engineer II” level these days.\n\nAnywho, this is all to say that, what I realized was it wasn’t the code itself where I added value and the act of writing code isn’t why I got into this business. I got into this because I like building things, and the way to do that was to write code. I still love building things, I’m just working at a higher abstraction now. It’s more code review for sure, but I’ve always enjoyed reviewing code. I’m building faster and even cleaner than ever, frankly. My code is even more well tested. Is it “easy”? No, not at all. In fact, I would say I spend more mental energy now than I did in years past. I spend more mental energy thinking through requirements and crafting prompts to get what I want. I spend my time and energy setting up systems to act as guide rails and to help the agents do even more consistent and reliable work, quickly. In some ways, I have become a bit of a manager. 🤷\n\nSpeaking of managers, that’s one role I’m worried for. Having used agents for my own side projects, they are more orderly and well planned than I’ve ever had, even at work with the best managers I’ve ever known. A few hours going back and forth with an LLM and I have a more concrete and clear plan with goals, user stories, acceptance criteria, and decision documentation than I have _ever_ seen a manager produce. Having just gone through quarterly planning for my team and all the meetings that involved, both with the ICs and the time spent before, it was several weeks of work. Our managers/directors spend about 6 weeks before the start of each half to plan, then another couple weeks with the ICs to plan and kick off the quarter. Frankly, almost all of that can be replaced with a handful of hours with an LLM, spread out over however many days as you’d like. Put bluntly, I’d be much more worried if I was middle management, and to a slightly lesser extent, direct IC level manager or team/tech lead. I think we’re on the cusp of seeing a massive contraction of management, where the managers who have put in the effort to learn to make AI agents work for them will replace managers who don’t. I think it will likely end up with a single manager with AI being able to do the job of 3-5 managers. I’m not even a manager (have been previously) and I’m confident I could run a few to a handful of small teams of engineers equipped with AI agents at all levels, and we would absolutely ship like no tomorrow.",

(i use BDG which gives the llm access to the console.log and dev tools) \n\nat this point i usually do more manually  but you can either tell it to save the process in a bash script and create a review about it or check yourself. \n\nthe only reason I check myself  during this phase is because although LLMs are great at creating UI they sometimes get stuck on only one type of UI which might not be optimal for the user experience so I go through myself to make sure it feels right but this can be automated easily im just trying to learn and figure out thigns more in this aspect. \n\n\n\n",

Every time I try to vibecode something slightly ambitious it just burns my tokens. If, however, I guide the AI with my own design and directions, it can do a pretty impressive job.\n\nI'll give an example. I vibecoded a script for looking up the nutrition facts of foods. So far so good, then I gave a meal and asked for alternative meals with same nutrition profile (calories, macros and fibers). It give me alterative meals with exact same calories but the other quantities (carbs, proteins, and fibers) didn't match pretty well. Then I suggested: \"Please use linear programming to make it as similar as possible\" and it replied \"Good idea\" then applied the technique I suggested and I obtained the result I wanted (it rebalanced the weights of the ingredients to get more precise match of the original meal). If I didn't know about linear programming in the first place it would never gave me the better solution.\n\n  \nI'm pretty much convinced the optimal results is using AI with as much human expertise involved as possible in the process. I don't see AI agents being able to create of the magnitude of Linux or PostgreSQL by itself any time soon, we are on the phase of the diminishing returns already, Anthropic just tried to create a C compiler (a well understood problem with lots of training data available), and it produced a mediocre one.",

I'm fortunate enough that my company invested in the tools, I'm literally spending $1000+ a month on my claude code usage, paid for by the company and my leaders have expressed explicitly that I should continue to use it heavily. Which makes sense, my time ain't cheap, so if $1000 gets me at least a 20% productivity boost that's a solid ROI\n\nHistorically I've had a really high bar for code quality. My colleagues would probably tell you I was the most critical on pr feedback. I don't come at it from a purely intellectual perspective and suggest frivolous changes, but rather I've been on calls at 3am and had to be able to quickly understand a system that was foreign to me, debug and apply a fix. So if I look at your code and can't quickly figure out what the fuck you're trying to do, it doesn't meet the bar. Code comments should always tell me why, code should be self explanatory as to the what or how. Full stop.\n\nNow as for today. I've lightened up quite a bit on my review process and quality bar, because through that same lens I've created skills and processes using AI to achieve the same goal. Literally just this week I had to debug an issue with a container that was crashlooping and it was a pita to get what I needed to debug before it crashed. I used Claude code to help stand up a side car to the container in minutes, grab a heap dump, then read the heap dump and help find most likely causes. Faster than I ever couldve reading code or logs or anything by hand we narrowed it down to a problem with the ORM's (I fucking hate ORM's for this reason) default query behavior.\n\nNow where I struggle a bit is if we say okay, we have the problem solved then, now that makes Claude a critical cog in our infrastructure and ability to maintain it. I'm not sure that's the best. But right now, it works great in a real production environment. I still read code myself. I still drop feedback. But I let a lot more go than I would've before and I leverage a combination of anthropic's pr review skill plus some homebrewed skills to help find the gaps. I've been shipping more code than before. It's almost exclusively AI generated and I don't bother with looking at the diffs until I've manually tested it and put it up as a draft pr. Then I self review, both with my eyes and the aforementioned ai review skills. Then I ping my team when I'm ready.\n\nI still try to keep PR sizes reasonable though. If I get around anywhere above a few hundred LOC, not including codegen or tests, I try to reign it in and have blocked more than 1 or as not reviewable due to size.",

These commands walk you through the entire process of idea to implementation.

However, they are great for most of the front-end stuff (especially since design is not my strong suit), as well as turning function declarations and UI elements into manual/reference pages on the website. \n\nSo while the LLMs are great and have made many cumbersome tasks easier (as well as allowing me to just vibe code some small side projects that I wanted to do but never took the time to do), the progress of them has been rather disappointing, so much so that I am confident that they will not replace an experience programmer who is working on something new in the near future.

I’m still figuring it out, but honestly? It’s great. I can produce faster and for things that are new and don’t have pre established patterns for us, I can set the standard.\n\nMy only complaint is that it sometimes causes people to not know what’s going on. I had a new API endpoint to write integration tests for, and I started by hand and asked the engineer who wrote the framework and everything in it how to debug it. She said “Just ask AI”. In the end, that’s what I did and it worked, but the fact that I couldn’t do normal debugging steps kind of concerned me. Sure, I got a test that worked, but I do think not writing it yourself forces you to maybe lose some of that debugging skill? Then again, as I said, it’s been a week, so I’m new.\n\nThe best analogy I can apply is kind of like reading a PowerPoint vs writing down the content. I don’t know about you, but I learn a lot better by writing. I can explain to you every little choice then. I don’t like the thought of AI generating something and then it being asked about in a PR why I chose to do something one way instead of another and my only response being “AI said so”, you know?",

With Codex I have it make changes all over my entire codebase, completely hands off. It almost always writes the code properly, and most of the times way better than I could. Most of the time if the code isn't good it's because I didn't give it a good prompt. I still review the code, but if I do have to tweak it, it's very minor things that are just quicker for me to change than ask Codex again. I haven't built a complete app from the ground up using only AI yet. I think that is a lot more challenging but I plan to do that next. I would say that it's only a matter of months before I'll probably never write a line of code again. But as a software developer, the coding was never really my true value, it was in the design itself, which hasn't gone away, and hopefully wont anytime soon. I will admit that I am quite nervous about AI making us irrelevant, but there's nothing we can do to change where things are headed, so you're best bet is to learn these tools to make new software and let's hope for the best.

I think when using LLMs in coding there vibe coding which treats software as a black box which is an absolute no no for prod, and then there is AI assisted coding. Claude code and similar tools are extremely useful in this area. If your code base is well structured, especially in a well documented language like Java, you could get massive performance gains just by cutting time on busy work. If you’ve built system you might notice some features tend to mirror others structurally. Similar transactional modules and most master modules are structurally near identical except for their entity differences. In situations like these you can get the agent to generate entire features by mirroring existing features for new entities. Setting up the workflow to preview results layer by layer combined with Javas inherent strong types makes this a perfect use case. LLMs are amazing for identifying logical errors as well. Often time when I build a new feature before running and testing the endpoint I would ask the agent to navigate through the endpoint all the way to the db layer and verify no logical errors or anomalies. And they are really really good for documentation and auditing your code base, say you need compliance for a strict set of guidelines or you need to document a new feature in a specific format, Claude is your guy. I’m sure there are many more way to use it but this is how I have seen massive productivity gains in production while ensuring code quality and not losing control. Cuz no matter what the ai generate I can personally account for every semicolon in the code base.",

It ignores my workflows, sometimes partially and basically it's forcing me to turn on thinking / high effort on Opus 4.6 or its unusable.  \nAnd it drains tokens.\n\nI haven't really tried Claude inside VSCode yet, because It was very buggy before and didn't allow for queued messages to propagate until work was finished, only allowing for hard interrupts. This might have changed but I haven't tested it.\n\nIn any case, I'm liking Codex in VSCode, because I feel more like im actively staying hands-on with decisions. It respects the rules, boundaries and understands the workflows perfectly. When asking about technicalities about implementations, it analyses the problem; gives me thorough insight and available options; It explains technicalities in-depth if asked to, searches the web for best conventions if asked to, and doesn't require me to press enter on things that I request (and thus accept beforehand).\n\nIt is a little bit of extra typing work to reference all the correct files, but honestly, it's a better and more productive work flow than letting Claude Code trip over its own tooling\n\nMy experience with Claude Code as of late? extensive tooling use; ignoring available mcps or silently failing them if they don't work; forgetting context because it fails to follow the workflows; project-plan workflow and planning mode conflicting thus I have to spend double tokens on just writing its artifacts to my projects ./plans dir.\n\nCodex in VSCode gives me what I love about web based brainstorming with the addition of directly implementing decisions.  \nClaude wants to first write very length docs, oh how it loves to write .md files. But then it just fails on core tenants and have used multiple sessions for somethin that was basically 30 LOC, already demonstrated in referenced project and just required implementation in existing work.  \nNot good for my health: I get frustrated because \"CLAUDE SHOULD JUST DO IT\" instead of just doing it myself. It's not even making sensible choices in terms of development. It keeps copies of old implementations side by side with requested, and then when its context is degraded and I have to start a new convo (either autocompact, or avoiding autocompact), it doesn't read the original plan files... it just goes straight into implementation and re-testing things that were already tested, and then just doing 10% of the work.\n\nAs you can read...Ive made my decision.  \nIm going to switch to the very cheaper codex plan, and enjoy GPT 5.3-Codex ...since im already enjoying GPT 5.2-Codex, no brainer.\n\nIll be putting Claude on high effort with thinking to burn through the usage for the month, and unsubscribe. The 42 euro free was nice, but seeing as how little actually I'm getting out of it.. it's just another Anthropic \"christmas gift\" to me.\n\nMaybe it's just that terminal based is not for me. I'm definitely not a one-shotter. I'm an architect. I only one-shot when I have my own frameworks/generators and conventions well established and differentiatedcreated.  \n  \nBut when it comes to hybrid data layers involving AI stuff, and some lack of experience in some languages (health issues, only got on the python + AI bandwagon since august despite 25+ years dev experience), I just require more explaining to be able to actually define some technicalities better.  \nIf I don't, I don't end up with bleeding edge high-performance, event driven and scalable (all the things I crave) but extensive boilerplating and frequent swearing and broken keyboards.",

It stopped working after updates + planning mode started to take precedence over my workflows a few weeks ago. I believe this is straight up enforcement from the Claude devs, as a coping mechanism for it's shortcomings (i.e.g without it, it is lost).  \nThey don't think about that there are users who want to EXTEND on the planning features by having an extended workflow with project stored plans/todo lists, smaller work session logs, BACKLOG and commits.  \nYes, I could do something else like create github issues for everything and do pull requests, but A) If you're solo'ing that's just cumbersome and silly, and pretty sad and lonely to be honest talking to yourself in github issues. B) Switching is faster.  \n  \nI see Codex just handles my workflows just fine.  Then I know it's not the workflow, it's the provider, choice is \"B\".",

It is very good at implementation.\n\nFor the tools:\n\nFrom the CLI perspective Claude has an edge, it has more features, it is more robust and it handles multiple agents better, or at least it seems too.\n\nCodex desktop is actually quite nice, between the diff window, voice prompt and the open vscode button, I eventually enjoyed it more than the CLI.\n\nFor the model:\n\nI found GPT in \"speak professionally mode\" very efficient, no emotion, it doesn't behave like a cheerleader and seems to be much more ready to push back and give realist technical opinion. It's also much more proactive to request clarification and identify edge cases.\n\nI found it to have a better adherence to the tasks, when Claude sometimes \"lies\" about work being done or goes off on a side quest, GPT has been on point and focussed.\n\nI've seen a few edit issues, probably less than Claude, but nothing blocking, it always recovered quickly. Certainly not gemini bad levels.\n\nGPT is a better \"finisher\". Claude gets the work done but usually leaves a devastated field behind him, I need hooks and skills and claude.md reminder not to leave a bloody trail of linting errors behind. During my whole test GPT has been systematically cleaning all the linting issues CAYGO style without being asked specifically. I didn't have a single task that didn't end with a working build and zero linting issues. Claude... Well... Not my experience... More like *\"those linting errors are not from my change, so I won't fix them and ok, I fixed two out of 300, let me mark the task complete and move on\"*. It's actually just as hard to motivate Claude to fix the linter than it is with a human. \n\nGPT behaved better on a very long session. Claude's context management has been subpar forever. I've even let one of the GPT sessions run-on for a whole day without ever feeling that it had lost the plot.\n\nOne very large codebase, well, it really wasn't bad honestly but our codebase is heavily documented (a job that was done for earlier versions of Claude) so that always helps a lot and our codebase is mostly well organized and modular so there not really a case for an LLM to be looking at more than one or two modules at the same time. I've built a couple of features and it was fine, slower than the from scratch project obviously but largely ok. It seemed to have a better grasp of the purpose but I can't objectively quantify that.\n\nWhich brings me to domain understanding, at least the one I work in, and GPT is by far the best, I've ran the same design task with the same starting prompt in Claude, gpt and gemini and GPT is so much more thorough and accurate and the result are much more logically organized and I honestly had to really strain to find inaccuracies, the actuarial models were correct and it got the legal requirement across geographies 90% correct, gemini is second best its biggest failure was assuming UK law applied everywhere and getting obsessed with integration standards which are more marketing than reality, Claude made the least effort, the output had the least in depth, the domain understanding had a few more errors and the understanding of the legal framework mixed up multiple regulation between the US, Europe, UK.\n\nGPT's implementation would have had us apologize to the regulatory body for the mistake and get off with a warning, Claude's would have resulted in a fine and probably an audit.\n\nGPT was not very good at UI work at least not at making stuff pretty, that has been a drag. That said, Claude isn't great either but still better. Even gemini has more flair than GPT.\n\nMy task was unfair but I just ask them for ideas to improve the UI look and both Claude and Gemini propose some decorative adjustment among other things but GPT is all about WCAG compliance with subsection 42.4.6 rev2 and whatnot. so yeah, that IS an important UX question, but it does nothing for the styling. Good technician, terrible artist. I want art goddamnit! 😆\n\nIn the end they are honestly both very good models, frankly on par with each other but the price difference is not even funny. The amount of value I got out of $30 with the plus subscription compared to anthropic's pricing is wild. \n\nI don't know where I am in my quota but very honestly I was so used to anthropic's limits that I was truly expecting to spend half a day on my tests and be told to bugger off and go see the sun and it just keeps on going....\n\nI would say, if you have a small budget, go for gpt, if you have a large one, do give it a try and ponder whether that extra 100 isn't better used buying something else.",

When I'm thoughtfully working I never hit limits with the 20x plan because I have to formulate the query, make the query, review the output, pass that that through whatever skills it needs to go through for a second look, lather, rinse and repeat, etc. I will occasionally have two windows open doing something in parallel, but so much of my work has to be sequential that I rarely hit limits. It doesn't do me any good to have 10 agents creating 10 times as much garbage when wrangling one agent can sometimes be a lot of work.  Sometimes I might run ClaudeCode in multiple IDE's where I'm doing different projects but even that is pretty rare.  E.g., web app in one window, SQL data analysis in another IDE at the same time. Or I'll have Claude pulled up in the browser.  But all of that is pretty rare.",

So I'm not reviewing for bugs but for coding standards, maintainability, and architecture and usually Claude starts picking up on that stuff itself.\n\nPlus I have skills to have Claude make stacked changes, which dramatically reduces review fatigue, as well as skills to rebase the stack etc. if I make changes to an earlier review.\n\nSo by the time I seriously review the code, it's already in stacked changes, bugs found by CI have been fixed, code rabbit feedback integrated, etc. and it's a pretty easy review.\n\nThe only time it takes awhile is if there are nontrivial bugs I have to dig in, then Claude is only mildly helpful, and this is where I \\*really\\* use tokens by spawning a bunch of subagents to write debug scripts for a bunch of different hypotheses and gather data to try to parallelize debugging.  There tends to be a lot of VEERY long \"thinking\" blocks at this stage as we're already at a nontrivial problem.\n\nFor the RAM bottleneck, I have 256GiB on my dev machine, with 8TiB of storage for lots of worktrees and build artifacts.",

      "text": "After Agent Teams shipped, I kept wondering how Claude Code coordinates multiple agents. After some back and forth with Claude and a little reverse engineering, the answer is quite simple.\n\nOne of the runtimes Claude Code uses is tmux. Each teammate is a separate claude CLI process in a tmux split, spawned with undocumented flags (--agent-id, --agent-name, --team-name, --agent-color). Messages are JSON files in \\~/.claude/teams/<team>/inboxes/ guarded by fcntl locks. Tasks are numbered JSON files in \\~/.claude/tasks/<team>/. No database, no daemon, no network layer. Just the filesystem.\n\nThe coordination is quite clever: task dependencies with cycle detection, atomic config writes, and a structured protocol for shutdown requests and plan approvals. A lot of good design in a minimal stack.\n\nI reimplemented the full protocol, to the best of my knowledge, as a standalone MCP server, so any MCP client can run agent teams, not just Claude Code. Tested it with OpenCode (demo in the video).\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1qyj35i/video/wv47zfszs3ig1/player\n\n  \nRepo: [https://github.com/cs50victor/claude-code-teams-mcp](https://github.com/cs50victor/claude-code-teams-mcp)\n\nCurious if anyone else has been poking around in here.",

From what I can tell the messaging between teammates goes through a shared task directory at \\~/.claude/tasks/{team-name}/ and each agent gets notified via the SendMessage tool which gets injected into their conversation as a new turn. So its basically prompt injection in the sense that messages appear as if they were user messages to the receiving agent.\n\n  \nThe shared task list is the main coordination mechanism. Agents claim tasks, mark them done, and check for new work. The team config at \\~/.claude/teams/{team-name}/config.json has the member registry so agents can discover each other by name.\n\n  \nI have been running agent teams from my phone via Moshi (its a mobile terminal with mosh protocol) and the coolest part is you can SSH in, kick off a team, close the app, and come back later to check progress since mosh survives network switches. The agents just keep working.",

          "text": "This is a really solid reverse engineering job. The filesystem-based coordination is interesting — we built something similar for a multi-agent system (work queue with JSON state files, fcntl-style claim semantics) and hit a few non-obvious gotchas worth sharing:\n\n**Cycle detection matters more than you'd think.** With 3+ agents, circular task dependencies are surprisingly easy to create accidentally. We ended up implementing a topological sort check on task creation, not just execution — catching cycles early saves debugging time when agents are spawning autonomously.\n\n**The fcntl lock approach has an edge case with crash recovery.** If an agent process dies mid-task (OOM, API timeout, etc.), the lock releases but the task file is left in an inconsistent state. We added a \"claim expiry\" pattern — tasks claimed for longer than N minutes without a heartbeat get automatically reset to the ready state. Without this, orphaned tasks silently block the queue.\n\n**Message ordering across filesystem inboxes is tricky.** File creation timestamps have limited resolution on some filesystems (HFS+ is 1-second granularity). If two agents write messages within the same second, ordering is non-deterministic. Numbered filenames (like you mentioned) solve this but you need a global counter or UUID-sorted names to avoid collisions.\n\nThe MCP server extraction is clever — decoupling the coordination protocol from Claude Code specifically means any MCP-compatible client gets agent teams for free. Curious if you've tested with agents running on different models (e.g., one Opus agent coordinating with a Codex agent via MCP)?",

      "text": "I'm a solo dev vibecoder. For months I had this setup: plan features in ChatGPT, generate audit prompts, paste them into Claude Code to review the whole codebase, send Claude's analysis back to ChatGPT in AI-friendly format, ChatGPT generates actionable prompts with reports, send those back to Claude to execute.\n\nThis workflow was working really well, I shipped 4 production apps that generate revenue using exactly this loop. But then I got exhausted. The process takes days. ChatGPT chats get bloated and start hanging. Copy-pasting between two AI windows all day is soul-crushing.\n\nSo I switched to Codex CLI since it has direct codebase context. Started preparing .md files using Claude Code, then letting Codex review them. It worked, but I kept thinking. I can automate this.\n\nThen the idea hit me.\n\nWhat if Claude Code could just call Codex directly from the terminal? No middleman. No copy-paste. They just talk to each other.\n\nI built the bridge. Claude Code started running codex commands in the shell and they instantly worked like partners. Efficiency went through the roof, they detected more bugs together than either did alone. I brainstormed a name in 3 minutes, wrote out the architecture, defined the technical requirements, then let both AIs take control of the ship. They grinded for 2 straight days. The initial version was terrible. Bugs everywhere, crashes in the command prompt, broken outputs. But then it got on track. I started dogfooding CodeMoot with CodeMoot using the tool to improve itself. It evolved. Today I use it across multiple projects.\n\nHow it works now:\n\nBoth AIs explore the whole codebase, suggest findings, debate each other, plan and execute. Then Codex reviews the implementation, sends insights back to Claude Code, and the loop continues until we score at least 9/10 or hit the minimum threshold.\n\nThis is the new way of working with AI. It's not about using one model, opinions from multiple AI models produce better, cleaner code.\n\nTry it (2 minutes):\n\nYou need claude-code and codex installed and working.\n\n\\# Install\n\nnpm install -g u/codemoot/cli\n\n\\# Run in any project directory:\n\ncodemoot start          # checks prerequisites, creates config\n\ncodemoot install-skills # installs /debate, /build, /codex-review slash commands into Claude Code\n\nThat's it. No API keysuses your existing subscriptions. Everything local, $0 extra cost.\n\n\n\nFurther I have added various tools inside it which i actively use in mine other projects and also for the codemoot itself:\n\n\n\nWhat you get: (use it in claudecode)\n\nTerminal commands (run directly):\n\ncodemoot review src/                         # GPT reviews your code\n\ncodemoot review --prompt \"find security bugs\" # GPT explores your codebase\n\ncodemoot review --diff HEAD\\~3..HEAD          # Review recent commits\n\ncodemoot fix src/                            # Auto-fix loop until clean\n\ncodemoot cleanup . --scope security          # AI slop scanner (16 OWASP patterns)\n\ncodemoot debate start \"REST vs GraphQL?\"     # Multi-round Claude vs GPT debate\n\n\n\nSlash commands inside Claude Code (after install-skills):\n\n/codex-review src/auth.ts    — Quick GPT second opinion\n\n/debate \"monorepo vs polyrepo?\" — Claude and GPT debate it out\n\n/build \"add user auth\"       — Full pipeline: debate → plan → implement → GPT review → fix\n\n/cleanup                     — Both AIs scan independently, debate disagreements\n\n\n\nThe meta part: Every feature in CodeMoot was built using CodeMoot itself. Claude writes code, GPT reviews it, they debate architecture, and the tool improves itself.  \n\n\nWhat I'm looking for:\n\n \\- Does npm install -g u/codemoot/cli + codemoot start work on your setup?\n\n \\- Is the review output actually useful on your project?\n\n \\- What commands would you add?\n\nContributors are welcomed, suggestions are respected and feedbacks are appreciated its made for vibecoders and power users of claude code for free what other companies dont provide.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/katarmal-ram/codemoot](https://github.com/katarmal-ram/codemoot)\n\nOpen source, MIT.

Less ambiguity.\n- **Single source of truth** - Keep the codebase state in one place. Agents read from it, write decisions back, but don't rely on conversational memory across models.\n- **Explicit contracts** - Define what each agent is responsible for (e.g., ChatGPT = planning, Claude = execution). When responsibilities overlap, you get circular reasoning.\n\nAlso curious: how do you handle cases where Claude's analysis contradicts ChatGPT's plan? Does one model have veto power, or do you resolve it manually?",

Reduces the telephone game effect. The handoffs are already somewhat structured review findings come back as JSON with severity, file, line, message fields rather than freeform prose. So Claude isn't interpreting vibes, it's reading structured data. As for contradictions right now it's manual. If GPT's review disagrees with something Claude did, it surfaces the findings and you decide. I've been thinking about adding a tiebreaker round where both models see each other's reasoning and have to converge, but haven't shipped that yet. The debate command is the closest thing it runs actual back-and-forth rounds between them until you're satisfied.\n\nGood questions though, this is exactly the kind of stuff I'm iterating on.",

They actually talk back and forth until they reach consensus. \n\nI tried using gemini too but honestly Claude Code and Codex together are more than enough for any kind of brainstorming, review or architecture tasks. \n\nAlthough I am looking to add more CLIs to orchestration down the road but right now I am validating the core idea between two models arguing produces better code than either one alone.",

The CLI integration approach makes a lot of sense - keeps the full power of Claude Code's tool ecosystem while adding workflow automation.\n\nOne thing I've found helpful in similar setups: spawning agents with --agent flag + --append-system-prompt for task context preserves the frontmatter config (model selection, tool restrictions) better than passing raw system prompts. Lets you have role-specific agents (coder, reviewer, etc.) with different capabilities.\n\nAlso worth considering: background task support with output files, so you can kick off long-running agents and continue working rather than blocking on completion.",

That \"fast\" iteration actually cost me hours.\n\nWith mine new approach: Claude writes code ->GPT catches bugs on first review -> they debate edge cases I wouldn't have thought of -> I get cleaner code in fewer total iterations.\n\nSo per-iteration it's slower, but total time to production-ready code is way less. Especially for security stuff  GPT catches things Claude misses and vice versa. The real win isn't speed per iteration, it's fewer iterations overall.

I **got more done** with the $20 Codex in 2 days than in a month with Antigravity. I hope open-source models eventually reach this level at that price point, but for now, I don't see myself switching back to GLM, Kimi, or DeepSeek over Codex.\n\nP.S. Does 5.2 High take about an hour to finish a task? Yep... but it gets things right the first time (43 tries so far, and no misses yet).",

He has been a hands-on producer for tons of albums. He knows his way around a studio board, a DAW, drum machines, whatever. Possibly he can’t read sheet music or play you a Dorian scale on command, but otherwise he as fully informed about making music in a modern setting as one can be. He just likes to present this guru savant aura about himself now that he doesn’t have to get down into the weeds as much. \n\nThat is how programming with AI will be most successful. People who know code and best practices and what the AI is doing will be able to use it best without actually having to get down to the lower levels very often, while someone who doesn’t will be as useless as a producer who knew as little about music as Rubin pretends to.",

So you end up doing hybrid: AI for mechanical tracing, human for \"why would past-me have done this?\"\n\nKey workflow: give Claude the error message + relevant code (not the whole file), ask for hypotheses ranked by likelihood, then YOU choose which to test first based on your system knowledge.

A strict \"reproduce first, hypothesize second, fix last\" workflow in a skill fixed most of the \"it changed 5 files and broke 3 other things\" moments.",

          "text": "First off, huge thanks to u/bobo-the-merciful for creating Nelson. The Royal Navy framework for coordinating CC agent teams is genuinely clever; the hierarchy, the standing orders, the risk tiers; it all maps really well to how you'd want to manage parallel AI agents.\n\nI've been experimenting with token-efficient prompt encoding (inspired by CursorRIPER♦Σ) and decided to apply those techniques to Nelson as a test case. The result is Nelson♦Σ, a fork that preserves full functionality while compressing the skill from ~5,050 tokens across 30 files to ~800 tokens across 6 files.\n\n  What changed:\n  - Greek letter domains (Ω = workflow, Σ = risk tiers, Φ = standing orders, etc.)\n  - Subscript indexing instead of verbose labels (Σ₀–Σ₃, Φ₁–Φ₁₁)\n  - Cumulative control notation (Σ₁ = Σ₀ + review + negative test)\n  - Standing orders compressed from 11 separate files to an inlined array\n  - Templates reduced from 6 blank-form files to field arrays\n  - All index/router files eliminated\n\n  What's preserved:\n  - All 6 workflow steps (Define, Compose, Plan, Monitor, Verify, Close)\n  - Full role hierarchy (COORD → LEAD → crew)\n  - All 4 risk tiers with cumulative controls\n  - All 11 anti-pattern checks\n  - All 6 damage control procedures\n  - Unit names from Royal Navy warships\n\nThe idea is that LLMs parse structured symbolic notation just as well (often better) than verbose prose, so you can convey the same instructions in a fraction of the tokens. Less context spent on the skill = more context available for the actual mission.\n\nI would love for some people to test it out.\n\nRepo: https://github.com/johnpeterman72/nelson.sigma\nOriginal: https://github.com/harrymunro/nelson",

The Royal Navy offers a nice model for how to manage complex things. \n\nBut for a more detailed response to your question, I asked Claude:\n\n# Why Nelson?\n\nWithout Nelson, agent teams give you the mechanics (spawn agents, assign tasks, send messages) but no framework for running them well. Nelson adds three things:\n\n## 1. Risk-tiered quality gates\n\nEvery task is classified into a risk tier with escalating controls:\n\n| Station | Level | Controls |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 0 — Patrol | Low blast radius | Basic validation, rollback step |\n| 1 — Caution | User-visible changes | Independent agent review, negative test cases |\n| 2 — Action | Security/compliance impact | Red-cell adversarial review, go/no-go checkpoint |\n| 3 — Trafalgar | Irreversible actions | Human confirmation, two-step verification, halt if controls unavailable |\n\n## 2. Operational structure\n\nA six-step flow forces discipline that ad-hoc teams skip:\n\n- **Sailing Orders** — scope, constraints, budget, forbidden actions, and stop criteria defined upfront\n- **Form Squadron** — mode chosen by matching conditions (single-session / subagents / agent-team), not gut feel\n- **Battle Plan** — tasks split with owners, dependencies, and file ownership\n- **Quarterdeck Rhythm** — periodic checkpoints for progress, blockers, and budget burn\n- **Action Stations** — risk-appropriate verification before marking anything complete\n- **Stand Down** — structured teardown and captain's log\n\n## 3. Institutional memory\n\nStand-down produces a record of decisions, rationale, validation evidence, open risks, and reusable patterns — context that most coordination approaches discard.\n\n## When not to use it\n\nNelson adds ceremony. For a quick change touching one or two files, use a single session or plain subagents. Nelson is for missions where coordination failures, unchecked risk, or lost context would actually cost you.",

A bit of info on this page.  \n[https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory#manage-auto-memory](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory#manage-auto-memory)\n\nI asked Claude about it after I saw it writing to memory and got the response below.  My takeaways:\n* You may want to inspect these project-specific memories.  If something odd is saved in there, it could cause unexpected behaviour - and your CLAUDE.md would look normal and fine.\n* There is a 200-line limit per project for this auto-memory\n* You can turn off auto-memory as well. CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY=1\n\n\n\n> ## 🛠️ Project Documentation vs. 🧠 AI Auto-Memory\n>\n> ### **CLAUDE.md** *(Project Root)*\n>\n> **Your instructions to me.**\n>\n> * **Source Control:** Checked into Git and shared with your entire team.\n> * **Ownership:** **You** write and own it. I only update it when specifically asked.\n> * **Content:** Project architecture, coding conventions, test commands, and \"do/don't\" rules.\n> * **Analogy:** Think of this as the **onboarding manual** for a new developer.\n>\n> ### **MEMORY.md** *(~/.claude/projects/.../memory/)*\n>\n> **My notes to my future self.**\n>\n> * **Source Control:** **NOT** in Git; local to your machine and persists across conversations.\n> * **Ownership:** **I** write and own it. I update it proactively as I learn your project's quirks.\n> * **Content:** Debugging lessons, specific \"gotchas,\" patterns that failed, and internal logic flow.\n> * **Analogy:** Think of this as a developer's **personal scratchpad** or \"til\" (today I learned) log.\n>\n> ---\n>\n> ### **Quick Comparison: When to use which?**\n>\n> | Feature | CLAUDE.md | Auto-memory (MEMORY.md) |\n> | --- | --- | --- |\n> | **Who writes it** | You (or me when asked) | Me, proactively |\n> | **In Git?** | **Yes** | **No** |\n> | **Purpose** | Project truth & instructions | Operational knowledge & \"gotchas\" |\n> | **Example** | `\"Run tests with pytest tests/\"` | `\"Logic check A must happen before B or Test X fails.\"` |\n>\n> ---\n>\n> ### **The Bottom Line**\n>\n> The **auto-memory** is the newer, sharper pattern. It lets me remember that \"one weird trick\" needed to make your build pass without cluttering your professional project documentation with my internal \"aha!\" moments.\n",
