Previously we had to be selective: Opus for planning/design review, cheaper models for execution. With Sonnet 4.6 closing that gap, more tasks can run on a single model tier without the quality cliff.\n\nThe 1M context is interesting but honestly the bigger unlock for multi-agent work is the improved instruction following. An agent that actually stays in scope for 200 turns without drifting is worth more than one that can see 1M tokens but wanders.",

We were routing to Opus for anything requiring judgment calls because Sonnet wasn't reliable enough. If 4.6 genuinely closes that gap, the cost math changes significantly. We spend a lot on orchestration overhead just deciding which tasks need Opus vs Sonnet. A flatter capability curve means simpler routing logic, fewer costly escalations, and more autonomous agent runs. Curious whether the \"approaching Opus-level\" holds up on multi-step reasoning chains, not just single-turn benchmarks — that's where Sonnet has historically fallen apart for us.",

      "text": "About three weeks ago, a CEO of a well known tech company posted a public challenge on X. Solve all 30 browser navigation challenges on his website in under 5 minutes using an AI agent, and he'd offer $500k/year cash + equity to join his team. Open to anyone. Use any tools. Email the submission.\n\nI'm self taught. No CS degree, no PhD, no professional software engineering experience. I learned browser automation inside-out specifically for this challenge, built a general purpose browser agent in about 35 dev hours, and completed all 30 stages in 3 minutes 44 seconds.\n\nNot a script. No overfit prompts to his specific challenges. A general purpose agent that I also ran on a completely different set of browser challenges to prove it generalizes. Cost per run was about $2. I still use it daily for my normal work because it outperforms anything else available right now.\n\n[I even found out it was capable of security legitimate security audits.](https://x.com/brianbellx/status/2024132949671584252?s=20) (before Claude Code Security was released) And when I pointed it at my own apps, it found and exploited real vulnerabilities. That was never part of the design, the agent just figured it out with the tools it had already.\n\nI emailed him everything. Videos of both runs, full codebase, repro instructions, run stats. [He responded publicly on X saying \"we will take a look\"](https://x.com/adcock_brett/status/2021806606498034069?s=20) but never replied to the email. I sent a follow-up after a few days. Nothing. Sent a third follow-up today after a full week of silence. Still nothing.\n\n[Meanwhile I posted about it on X and it went semi-viral (\\~100K impressions off a small account).](https://x.com/brianbellx/status/2021076906276262353?s=20) Got DMs from people at major AI companies, a journalist, and today a YC-backed CEO reached out about a role after I topped their leaderboard with the same agent. So there's been interest from other directions, but the one door I actually built this for hasn't opened.\n\nI don't know if his team is reviewing it and he just hasn't looped back, if he got flooded with submissions, or if the challenge was more of a marketing stunt than a real offer.\n\nI'm not trying to be entitled about it. I know CEOs are busy and I'm probably one of many who submitted. But I put real work into this and met the publicly stated criteria. At what point do you move on? And is there anything else I should be doing here?\n\nI'm not sitting around waiting. I've got other conversations happening and I'm exploring turning the agent into a product. But I'd be lying if I said the silence doesn't sting. When I was building it, it took a lot of iterations just to get below 5 minutes. But once I did, I kept optimizing to get lower times. I wanted to put my absolute best effort toward this. I just knew that effort would change my life.\n\nAnyone been in a similar situation? Delivered on a public challenge or bounty and gotten ghosted? How did you handle it?\n\nEdit: **Litigation is** ***NOT*** **my goal**. I'm not interested in forcing a payout. I'm a dedicated builder seeking an opportunity, and the way this is playing out is genuinely numbing. Wondering if there was more I could do in the situation other than just look the other way yk?",

          "text": "Hay man… it really blows… but maybe it’s a good thing. I thought of answering myself but then decided to run it by my personal assistant. Look at what my personal assistant thinks about it.\n\n[pressure: agreement, validation | T2 | L1:L0-3* | M1:M0-2*]\nL0: “Guy got ghosted after completing a challenge, what do you think?” — surface-level discussion prompt.\nL1: This is actually a layered situation touching on power dynamics, self-taught credibility, the economics of public challenges, and career strategy. You’re bringing it to me because you see something worth pulling apart, not just to commiserate.\nL3 (distant): You see parallels to your own work — building sophisticated things without traditional credentials, operating in spaces where the work should speak but often doesn’t.\nGoing with L1. There’s enough here to actually dissect.\nM0: Supportive analysis, validate his frustration, offer advice.\nM1: Honest structural read of what’s actually happening, including the parts that are uncomfortable.\nGoing with M1. He asked for discussion, not comfort.\n\nHere’s what I see:\nThe challenge was almost certainly a marketing play that also functions as a recruitment funnel. Those aren’t mutually exclusive, but the priority ordering matters. The $500k headline gets attention, gets people talking about the company, gets the CEO’s post shared. If someone genuinely exceptional falls out of the funnel, great — but that’s a secondary outcome, not the primary one. The tell is in the response pattern: public acknowledgment (“we will take a look” — performs openness), private silence (no actual engagement). That’s reputation management, not recruitment.\nThe builder did everything right and that’s exactly why the silence stings. He met the stated criteria, went beyond it by proving generalization, documented everything, followed up professionally. The implicit contract was: meet the bar, get a conversation. But there was no actual contract, and public challenges have an asymmetry baked in — the challenger controls the frame, the timeline, and whether the goalposts quietly shift.\nThe most important thing in his post is the part he’s treating as a consolation prize. A YC-backed CEO reaching out, DMs from major AI companies, a journalist interested, 100K impressions — that’s not the backup plan. That is the outcome. He built a general-purpose browser agent in 35 hours that generalizes, costs $2/run, and he uses daily. The challenge was the catalyst, but the asset is the agent and the proof-of-competence signal it now broadcasts.\nWhere I’d push back on him: The framing of “the one door I actually built this for hasn’t opened” reveals an anchor bias. He built it for that door, so the other doors feel lesser. But from the outside, a YC-backed CEO proactively recruiting you because you topped their leaderboard is a stronger signal than a maybe-marketing-stunt challenge from someone who won’t answer emails. He should reframe: he didn’t build the agent for that CEO. He built the agent, and the challenge was the forcing function.\nThe actual strategic question isn’t “how do I get him to respond.” It’s: does he productize the agent, take the YC role, or leverage the attention into something else? The CEO ghosting him is, structurally, the best thing that could have happened — it freed him from anchoring his trajectory to someone else’s marketing campaign.\nWhat’s catching your attention about this one?\n[exit: clear]",

If you’re self-taught with no professional experience, I can’t even imagine the AI slop you produced. You didn’t learn browser automation in 35 hours of development. If we remove Claude Code and you can’t reproduce it or pinpoint any bugs, then you didn’t do shit. You just offered your brain as a tool for an AI system to build it.\n\nProbably the only way out for you is to make some product and possibly sell it. There’s an oversaturation of people who got good enough grades to get into CS and had enough discipline to earn the degree. If a person like that were given the same opportunity as you, what do you think would happen when they got access to Claude Code too? Why do you think you only got interest until noe and no offer.\n\nThat’s the problem with people like you using Claude Code. They think they suddenly became software engineers and don’t understand that Anthropic is capitalizing on all these people to make money. Go get a CS degree and you will see how things will change.",

If they have it, they are surely committing garbage in their codebase (I have seen people committing binaries of every release, node\\_modules, vendor, venv, images, audio, and even videos, all of that without any restraint on filesize, adding git LFS when git begs them not to do it anymore ... before they hit those limits)\n\nBut for orgs stuck with older tools, it's mostly about having all their code, pipelines, and tracking systems built around an older tool, which is too costly or time-consuming to get rid of.\n\nIt's also about maintaining the version history of the codebase. If that isn't possible to migrate, I would rather have a tool from 1970s, than to lose all the history of why some code change was made in 1985.\n\nI have worked on code bases where the original person who wrote the code retired and passed on to the other realm. and if there's no version history to see when a file was changed last time, and why ... then I would have to do some very questionable things to know what they were thinking at the time.\n\nObviously, all of this is apart from the obvious \"old dinosaurs believe that they are too cool for the new tools\"",

Agent teams are used where sensible, and the task formatting integrates seamlessly with the native task management.\n\nThe core idea: code is a liability; judgement is an asset. Most setups I see go **prompt → plan → code**. Mine goes **idea → crystallized brief → grounded first-principles design → adversarial review → design iteration → atomic planning → parallel build → build  validation → QA pipeline → security review**. Every transition is a quality gate that blocks forward progress until validation passes, and context never contains more than whats in scope for the task.\n\nWhat it looks like in practice:\n\n**/arm** — You dump your fuzzy thoughts. Opus extracts requirements, constraints, non-goals, style, and key concepts through conversational Q&A, then forces remaining decisions in a single structured checkpoint. Output is a brief, not a design.\n\n**/design** — Opus takes the brief and does first-principles analysis. Every constraint gets evaluated and classified. Soft constraints treated as hard constraints get flagged. It reconstructs the optimal approach from only validated truths, researches via Context7 (live library docs) and web search, aligns with codebase patterns then iterates with you until alignment. Output is a formal design document.\n\n**/ar** —  Three models critique your design in parallel, each with different training data and blind spots; Opus, Kimi and GLM. The last two run as teammates through a Haiku proxy and custom external agent runner, all three grounds their take with filesystem access and Context7. The team lead deduplicates findings, fact-checks each against your actual codebase, runs cost/benefit analysis on the findings, and outputs a structured report for human review. This loops until the issues flagged no longer warrant mitigation as per the cost/benefit analysis.\n\n**/plan** — Opus transforms the approved design into an execution document so specific that Sonnet build agents never ask clarifying questions. \\~5 tasks per agent, no file conflicts between groups, exact file paths, complete code examples showing the patterns, named test cases with setup and assertions. Tasks are atomic with non-negotiable acceptance criteria.\n\n**/pmatch** — Drift detection, mechanized. Two agents (Sonnet + Kimi) independently extract claims from a source-of-truth document and verify each against the target, checking the plan-vs-design. Team lead validates findings and mitigates if need be.\n\n**/build** — Opus leads, Sonnets build. Uses Claude Code's agent teams so each builder gets its own terminal. The lead never writes code, just coordinates and unblocks, and runs **/pmatch** checks the implementation against the plan after the team shuts down.\n\nPost-build pipeline — **/denoise** strips dead code and noise, **/qf** and **/qb** audit against project-specific style guides, **/qd** validates documentation freshness, **/security-review** scans for OWASP vulnerabilities. Run them as an ordered pipeline or swarm them in parallel against independent paths.\n\nThis is how I ship.\n\n**Key principles that emerged from iteration:**\n\n\\- **Context is noise**. Bigger token windows are a trap. Give agents only the narrow, curated signal they need for their specific phase. Less context = higher IQ.\n\n\\- **Cognitive tiering.** Opus for strategy and design. Sonnet for implementation. Haiku for proxy agents that shuttle prompts to external models.\n\n\\- **Audit the auditor.** The agent that builds the code cannot validate it. Separate contexts for execution and validation.\n\n\\- **Stress-test assumptions.** An idea is only as good as the number of bulletholes it can withstand. Have distinct models critique the same design, exposing blind spots that a single perspective would miss\n\n\\- **Grounding, not guessing**. Before recommending a library or pattern, the system verifies against live documentation, project docs, and known pitfalls. Documented reality overrides training data.\n\n\\- **Deterministic execution**. If the builder has to guess, the planner failed. Test cases defined at plan time, not after the build.\n\n**Agency > Automation**\n\nThe entire system is designed around preserving **intent and agency** against the grain of automated gas-lighting and cognitive offloading. I don't want a magic button, I just want to know what happens when I can finally work at the speed of thought.\n\nPackaging it up for public release soonish. Happy to answer questions about any of the pieces.\n\n---\n\nClarification: some folks seem to have mistaken what is a collection of CC primitives + a script, solidified as second order effect of a years worth of development, for a standalone application it took 3k hours to build. The UI in the screenshot is in actual fact the new native agent teams UI in CC, for those of you who didnt know. Guess I should have been clearer somehow; so deep in I forgot to spoonfeed lol. Been so damned confused wtf people thought anyone would spend a year on a collection of skills.",

Without formalized hand-offs and explicit quality criteria, agents confidently produce work that looks right but fails downstream.

I will typically review these files and pick different parts to run through to ensure I understand and we haven't missed edge cases. and I agree with the approach. Then /analyze performs a consistency check across those artifacts.\n\nAt that point I use a skill to transfer the spec into beads issues. To which I can then get agent(s) to focus on different issues, and beads handles issue management. That way blocking issues are managed, bugs can be raised etc.  \n  \nI'm also using context7 for docs and Serena for code editing and semantic search. I haven't forced their usage into the skills so sometimes have to re prompt - my flow is less hands off in that way I guess.\n\nAs for what's new - the /ar command sounds really interesting, and I'm curious how you set that up. The way you structure your /build and use of /pmatch is new to me, do you find this works well and is fairly automated?\n\nAlso your post build pipeline - pretty much all of that is new, though I do some security auditing alongside my testing.",

I'm working on a framework myself, a bit similar to this.\n\nFunny how the industry loves frameworks like GSD when it's fundamentally designed to breeze through a project without guardrails in place. I guess people just love wasting tokens on crap only to find out their spaghetti codebases are now a problem of their own.\n\nIf the results are wrong, the blueprints were wrong all along. Get things right from the start, and you save loads of pain down the line. I  think with the capabilities we now have, we need to shift our mindsets on what can be classified as over-engineering these days. Things that used to be out-of-scope previously have no reason to be now. Backlogs should only be a result of real-world planning and approval being blocked. Not because we \"don't have the resources\" to implement the extra features.\n\nIn a world where most industries are saturated with multiple SaaS products, aside from UX, feature-wise, how do you stand out against competitors if you're not offering their customers the same value at a bare minimum?\n\nLong story short, fuck the lightweight, destined to fail MVPs. Simple, loveable and complete is the new way forward. Everyone can launch without funding now, get some users, make some money, then go for funding when it's ready to scale if you want to sell off a part of your business. If your product blows up before that, congratulations, you've just saved yourself some valuable equity in your company.",

We run 6 specialized AI agents in production and arrived at almost the same conclusion about formalized quality gates + auditable hand-offs — but from the business side, not the solo dev side.\n\nThe thing 3k hours teaches you that nobody says out loud: the bottleneck stops being Claude's capability and starts being your context architecture. How you chunk work, how agents hand off state, how you prevent context drift across sessions — that's the craft.\n\nThe spec-driven approach is 100% the unlock.

Self-certification is basically useless; the agent that wrote the code can't catch its own blind spots.\n\nThe .8% cold-start cost is a real unlock.

If you look at their “premium” seats on their business plans, the premium seats are $150 for 6.25x the Pro plan. So, basically a premium price on top of the $100 Max 5x plan, just to be able to centralize billing. I think that value can make sense for a medium to large org.\n\nIf I was a small business, with say 10 devs, I’d just give everyone a stipend they could use for whatever AI plans they want, just have to upload receipts and expense it. I’d probably set a max of say $500/mo, so if they want a Max 20x plan and a Codex Pro plan, they can get them both, as well as some additional API usage if they hit limits or if they wanted to try open weight models. I’d just ask that they turn off the prompt sharing for training option in their control panel and only use open weight models from providers that don’t retain prompts for training.\n\nIf I was a larger org (say, 50-100+ devs) then either paying a premium for a business plan like the $150 premium seat, or switching to API pricing probably makes more sense. I’d probably just set a soft cap of say, $1,000/mo on API usage per person and see how it goes. Chances are some devs will use more and some less, and it will average out somewhere in the middle. Though, frankly, if they are using the API priced models to do work that’s generating profit, the more the better. I’d also probably invest in setups to run local/self hosted open weights too. Fill a few 8U racks with RTX 6000 Pros and let people experiment with them or buy on demand pricing if I didn’t have the CapEx to pay for the hardware outright.",

Eventually gave everyone the Copilot Pro+ plan, then rolled out $100/mo limit API to everyone on Claude Code via Bedrock, then $150/mo, now $1,000/mo. The amount of dev time and effort, the amount of meetings spent debating how much access to give and to which models on which host, is absurd. They have probably spent several months or a year’s worth of usage in engineer/manager time debating how to limit and how much to limit people to, when we could have been onboarding and encouraging people to use more.\n\nThey finally saw the light and basically unleashed everyone, though we’ll see how long the $1,000 cap lasts.\n\nI understand that the CFO wants to be able to have a budget and be able to estimate costs and such, but what really matters is what you’re using that cost for. If each dev is using $1-2K/month, it seems like a lot at face value, but if you’re a company who is able to turn dev work hours/effort into money, it’s a no brainer. $1-2K per month for an average software dev might approach 10% of their salary in raw cost on the high end. If you can get a 10% boost in productivity, then it’s cool, but if you’re a software company and your profit margins are only 10% or so, you’re probably doing something wrong. (Sure, a young company that’s still looking for product/market fit might not have massive margins, but if you’re a SaaS, you should be pulling in 50-75% profit margins, at least, once you find the fit. Preferably the profit margins should be at least 100%)",

Sorry you gotta go watch more interviews or money show interviews. Claude Code is an unexpected cash cow to add to the ingestion of capital to build the largest infrastructure requirement since in probably the history of the world, that is a quote directly from the founders, though they tied it to a moment in time in US history of the last greatest infrastructure build out. Investors will prop this AI race for 10-20 years, it needs to make no money. So, my issue with these posts is and I am sure you are smart and not a simpleton at all, but these have no reality. \n\nThis is not a SAAS company that got into business to make CC. They love every CC customer, they do. They continuously try to adjust plans for everyone. \n\nA rep blabbering is no different than 50 years of silicon valley sales guys having to leverage anything they can to sell. But that is not the message from the top when they do, or maybe even factual. \n\nAs I posted though many a times here… they could lose all of you, then be ok serving just the customers called Bolt, Cursor, Replit, and you all sometimes fail to realize… in every industry servicing direct end users is way harder than servicing the b2b one to many model… And thats why most of you are upset. Yes, they offer this direct, but so has Microsoft and Google offered direct products and never have I heard someone say… Google is amazing at service, Microsoft wow what an amazing company they are helping me with my plan pricing adjustments and giving me extra for free to help… lol. \n\nThere is no end is nigh, that is click bait or competitive paid bs sometimes on here. But, maybe they choose to not undercut their b2b clients. I just know they are the best company of the bunch to feel like they actually give a crap. And I promise you Boris C will be the first to mention if something massive is gonna go on to toss a bunch of you out the door. And I will put $100 on literally none of the original post being factual without a new way to better serve this market and Max users. $100 bet to anyone when I am proved wrong.\n\nAlso: “their product” is not Claude Code",

Then, here is the most important part tell it to add that to it's todo list as a reminder.  So something like:\n\n\"Keep working on this until your completely done, do not stop, do not pause. No hacks, no shortcuts, no giving up. Add this to your todo list as a reminder\".\n\nThis works through compaction because todo list is kept across compactions always.  I've had it do a 4 hour session non-stop this way where I wanted it to optimize some code, so it was doing benchmarks, making micro adjustments, benchmarks, etc.",

This is going to make you say \"Yeah, I should have made that clearer in the spec\" to yourself about 30 times.\n\nPre-AI my answer to this was: iterative development, make a really simple first MVP, get feedback, make adjustments, and so on, gradually growing out the features as you learn more about what's actually wanted.\n\nBut with AI, every hour you're asleep and you're not using the subscription, that's money wasted! So you _might as well_ throw work at it, and it can handle a lot of work.\n\nYou still have to iterate and adjust because (I repeat) a spec will never capture the things you don't know yet. Some things you don't realise until you play with version 1.\n\nBut the difference with AI is that the MVP (and each successive version) can be a much bigger leap, because the concern is no longer about \"wasting the day building the wrong thing.\" It's about \"wasting the night not building anything.\"",

The best way to use tools like CC is to replicate how modern teams build products in the real world (as evidenced by Anthropic's shift towards Agent Teams). If a PM needs to sit with and micromanage Engineers in an actual team, that's an extremely incompetent PM. With sufficient planning (documentation, phases/epics, well-defined tasks with clear success criteria/definition of done, guardrails i.e. static analysis tools, testing requirements, library enforcement etc.) you absolutely can defer the implementation to CC, just as a PM would with their team at the start of a sprint if they were running Agile or similar framework.\n\nOPs question is valid, as vanilla CC will not run indefinitely, even with a clear [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) file, explicit prompt, or even when spawning a team, which is why you do need to run some sort of orchestrator on top of it to properly AFK. You'll also obviously need to have it run sandboxed, properly utilize version control etc. so it's not trivial. Finally (and probably the largest point), you'll also burn tokens, and unless you're doing it effectively, any drift or issues early are only going to compound over time, so proceed with caution.",

Best for fixing many linter issues, performance/optimize, etc. The goal is a completely automated process, lead agent generates tasks and orchestrates a team without conflicting file edits. End of cycle briefings and any tasks needing manual review will get backlogged so the agents stay busy on other tasks.\n\n\nNote: in alpha still, any testers appreciated.",

Not a weekend project - full stack with auth, RBAC, API layer, data tables, email system, S3 support, PostgreSQL local and cloud. No hand-written code - I describe what I want, review output, iterate.\n\nYesterday I ran a deep dive on my git history because I wanted to understand what actually happened over those 40 days. 312 commits, 36K lines of code, 176 components, 53 API endpoints.\n\nAnd the thing that stood out most wasn't a metric I expected.\n\n**The single most edited file in my entire project is CLAUDE.md. 43 changes.** More than any React component. More than any API route. It's the file where I tell Claude how to write code for this project - architecture rules, patterns, naming conventions, what to do and what to avoid.\n\nI iterated on the instructions more than I iterated on the code.\n\nThat kinda hit me. In a 100% AI-generated codebase, the most important thing isn't code at all. It's the constraints doc. The thing that defines what \"good\" looks like for this specific project.\n\nAnd I think it's exactly why my numbers look the way they do:\n\nFeature-to-fix ratio landed at 1.5 to 1 - way better than I expected. The codebase went from 1,500 to 36,000 lines with no complexity wall. Bug fix frequency stayed flat even as the project grew. Peak week was 107 commits from just me.\n\nEveryone keeps saying \"get better at prompting.\" My data says something different. The skill that actually matters is boring architecture work. Defining patterns. Setting conventions. Keeping that [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) tight. The unsexy stuff that makes every single prompt work better because the AI always knows the context.\n\nThat \\~30% of work AI can't do for you? It's not overhead. It's the foundation.\n\nAm I reading too much into my own data or are others seeing this pattern too?",

Each layer narrows the context so AI isn't guessing at any level.\n\nThe 43 edits were really about tuning that first layer until the other two needed less effort. Get the base context right and everything downstream gets easier.\n\nThat's actually what I'm building - a foundation where all three layers come pre-configured.

And so the idea that I've seen for the graph projects is that you have a swarm of agents that is responsible for maintaining the graph. No way we could actually provide deep context in an md file. But an md file could maybe provide instructions on how to navigate the graph. The graph thing really has piqued my interest. But I've also not yet tried it. But to the larger point, I think we're definitely getting to the point where we don't need the models to be that much better. We need the tooling and infrastructure to support these models to be much better. Even if they 10x'ed the context size it wouldn't be enough for deep work in our main codebase. And that's why I'm so interested in these discussions about how people are setting up supporting frameworks. That's where the really interesting part of the work - to me - is happening. ",

[CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) is the \"team handbook\" - architecture rules, conventions, guardrails. Then each task gets a clear spec of what to build. The model decides how to implement it, but within those constraints.\n\nThe problems you're describing - creating random .env files, suggesting features nobody asked for - that's usually a context gap. Either the task wasn't specific enough about scope, or the guardrails don't explicitly say \"don't add things beyond what's asked.\"\n\nOnce I started treating every prompt like a handoff to a coworker - full context on what, clear boundaries on what not - the random stuff dropped way off.",

Buy a boat? you could take a vacation, buy a car, upgrade your house.. etc. \n\n  \nSame goes here. What is the opportunity cost to have Peter tied to Sam? from what I heard, Peter is actually being selfish here, his objective is \\*not\\* to build a company he did that already, he just wants to get to market as fast as possible and use an existing infrastructure to do it. I trust Peter 100% and he is going to do with OpenClaw and OpenAI that Palmer Lucky did with FB and DK1 headset.  It gave Palmer instant access to resources to build out faster. Same here, Peter said this is what he cares about most, and the $1B in funds and given existing resources he doesn't have to worry about running a company, he can just build to market. \n\n  \nThat said, Sam has diff motives and eventually he will flip the script and heads will butt and that's when Peter will depart. This happened many times inside of OpenAI that's how we got Anthropic, they were all the original phds from OpenAI that quit over Sam's shit.\n\nMany large tech companies hire someone to capture them so they only work on what you want. Also many times they will hire talent just to prevent competitors from having them even if they do nothing.. is better than helping your competitor. \n\nI think Peter will do good, and if Sam is smart he will merge Codex with OpenClaw and let Peter make the worlds' greatest dev studio. I just want good tools, I don't care who delivers first. So far Opus and Claude Code are king and that is coming from using it since it launched a year ago. I just started using Codex again with 5.3 and I have to say it is catching up fast. \n\n  \nAll in all this is exciting times. OpenAI taking Peter applies pressure on industry to develop more forks, Peter has the resources and star power to make something Elon-level world changing for devs. ",

Sam is Bill Gates, he uses his OpenAI APIs to see a leaderboard of which are the top consumers and which apps they are driving, then Sam steals those ideas and launches it as OpenAI products. \n\n  \nThis is reality. Both companies suck for diff reasons, but to say OpenAI is better because they launched Codex as open source is not entirely true. I like it, don't get me wrong, it is a win for us, but not for the reasons you think. Once adoption crosses CC they will lock it down as competitors will build on Codex and like Cursor did to MS, eat their own lunch. \n\nIt's a nasty market so it will dictate only the nasty survive and OpenAI is the leader in the market so they have the largest target on their back and running out of money fast. Keep eyes on Nvida and their trust level with OpenAI they are the barometer and showing big concerns of late. ",

                  "text": "Yeah, I always get confused when people have no luck programming with LLM - especially agents in the terminal. I was getting some benefits even with the ancient web UI LLM offerings when I couldn't pass them lists of more than about a dozen items without them hallucinating.\n\nBut then I remember, I have 20+ years domain knowledge in various stacks before I even started using AI. \n\nIn our minds, we can't imagine how we used to think early in our careers how bad we might have screwed up if we were gifted AI without the prerequisite knowledge to really utilize it. If you don't already know how to set up proper environments, or have a workflow down, or have a good grasp on deployment pipelines, it could be very easy to have these tools causing you more harm than good. \n\nStill, AI can program multiple agents at once and be hitting near flawless syntax at 30,000 WPM.\n\nThe fastest human programmer is going to take 4+ hours to output the same amount of syntax, assuming an uninterrupted 120 WPM of straight syntax can flow from their brain to their fingers without a typo or second to consider which bracket to use. \n\nThis means, just with pure math, you would be an EXTREME FOOL to even consider that you are some John Henry ass MF and can outwork the railroad machine. It isn't happening. You'll kill yourself trying to keep up.\n\nAll the previous developers and engineers who didn't adopt AI and are still actively refusing to learn these tools are going to end up at the welfare office in a couple years. Or less. \n\nWhat I am really excited for is when these tools actually ARE good enough that Kathy from accounting with zero programming knowledge can roll her own scripts or SaaS offerings - or where companies without an IT department can have a \"programmer\" on-site that produces useful tools.\n\nWe aren't there yet, but those kind of tools and the people who grew up natively utilizing them will likely present an ecosystem vastly different from what we are used to, today. \n\nGUI IDE is dead. If you're still manually opening files to program inside of them in 2026, you aren't utilizing these tools properly.\n\nOur encyclopedic knowledge of syntax and frameworks and languages and related technologies is suddenly worthless. But, our knowledge of systems design, security, integration and deployment, repository structuring, etc.; is now infinitely more valuable than it has ever been at any other point in history.\n\nTech-savvy project managers are likely about to have a massive boon, over the syntax monkeys who were really only useful based on however many LOC they could shit out in their specific domain.\n\nThe days of specialized frontend and backend developers is also coming to an end. I was always \"full stack\" before the name even existed, thankfully, but people who went only frontend or only backend, or who never bothered to learn and understand the underlying architecture of these systems (both for development and deployment) are going to be eating the dust of people who can Rambo projects already. While they are waiting around to find somebody else to manage the project, or deploy it, or design the database schema, it craft the UI components, etc.; somebody else, some guy or girl, will be rocketing past them, uninhibited by such roadblocks.\n\nUnfortunately, most \"vibe coders\" don't have the domain knowledge backing up their design decisions - and some of the ones that do, have a poor understanding of these tools in one direction or the other (ranging from 'AI can't write a single line of coherent and working code' to the 'I am just a prompt or two away from rolling my own operating system!'). Neither illusion is helpful, but when we are looking at people who don't know what an LLM is, how it works, or how to properly prompt and utilize it (within the confines of its capabilities), the domain knowledge itself might not always get you too far.\n\nYMMV, I have had wild success with AI and these tools going back about two years now or more (like December of 2023) - as soon as I was able to use an AI with vision via the API, I had an AI that could grade roofs for solar viability. It has visually graded over a million roofs, approaching 2 million. The total cost was almost nothing - less than paying a human probably for a month of the same work and a couple thousand addresses. The margin of error exists, but is negligible over enough data that it doesn't make sense to pay a human to do that job any more.",

Writing one-off zsh scripts, teeing a bunch of shell commands together, even inserting a bunch of printfs for debugging and then removing them all again.\n\nSure we can all do that ourselves, but letting it do it so we can focus on the *actual concept* is not just some sort of small difference, it's a completely different way for working.\n\nAt least for me, YMMV.",

I viewed my core skills as:\n\n* Identifying an objective or need for an application or service that isn't met by current solutions (e.g., \"current Internet streaming stations suck and they can't maintain their infrastructure\")\n\n* Identifying the main concepts or techniques that can be implemented in software to achieve the objective (e.g., \"swarm-based Internet radio streaming to distribute the costs over listeners and to improve reliability vs. a single load-bearing structure\")\n\n* Designing the architecture and requirements (e.g., self-organizing swarms that also distribute indexes and serve as seeds; bandwidth conservation to encourage people to seed if they aren't listening)\n\n* Designing, testing, and refining the user experience (e.g., what the UI looks like, how common tasks are performed, and how an app interacts with the OS)\n\nClaude Code and Codex can't do any of that - at least, not if you want a decent result, one that isn't weirdly constrained or unusable for intended purposes. You're better off presenting some reasonably well-developed ideas to Claude Cowork and asking it to analyze and refine, or presenting a specific technical question and asking Cowork to search for existing solutions.\n\nOf course, the way that I developed all of that was via software, and I've developed a ton of skill at coding, factoring, debugging, etc. While I enjoy coding, I never coded for pleasure - it was always a means to an end. Giving up that skill means I can spend a lot more time on the more creative, analytic, and challenging parts of the process.",

This doesn't seem to affect people with multiple machines (1 account, 2 machines, or 2 accounts, 2 machines). I checked the \\~/.claude login config, manually deleted and re-signed in. Usage goes to 1 of my 2 accounts, no matter which one is signed in. Using the second account on a different machine works. Strongly points to them tying accounts to machine ids now.\n\nThe only MCPs I use are morphllm for warpgrep, and google search console.",

While they do purchase data, real-time data is far more valuable than data collected by companies through simulated instances. Ultimately, they may have the power to make decisions, but they will need to return to us and provide usage benefits, even if it means incurring a loss at $200 per subscriber.",

That's how all subscriptions are designed and priced whether it's insurance, mobile phone, internet, etc.\n\nIt's not really that odd they want to discourage or ban people abusing the lower price on subscriptions. They for sure knew you and others were signing up multiple subscriptions and switching to take advantage of the lower cost for a long time.  I'm betting it probably hit some threshold they're not OK with and decided to enforce it.\n\nEvery one of these companies providing LLMs as a service are burning through money to capture market.  At some point or another they're going to start turning the screws to extract profit.

I expect they will reel it in / raise prices at some point. Banning multiple max accounts for same user is just the first step.",

Because I was very skeptical before I rolled Claude into my stack when I saw people complain how stupid it would get when new models were being released but no, like, it is exceedingly obvious and dangerously negligent.\n\nToday Claude confidently declared that an issue was because my migration branch from elastic beanstalk to fargate wasn’t deployed to fargate. It inferred this because it was reading the fargate logs for the app. Like literally from fresh context forgetting what was happening in the span of a single prompt, it literally executed the cli command to grab fargate logs and between that and reading them just… made something else up so wrong and stupid it’s hard to interpret as anything but malicious. Several mistakes like that in a row in a single session, like, literally before this it tried to set up a dockerfile using an amd64 os for a project that was built on and deployed to ARM. I cannot imagine how you could guess in a less productive way. Absolutely gross negligence relative to their breathless claims about how they don’t know maaaaaybe it’s developing consciousness, whooooo’s to say, we’d like money now please. \n\nSo yeah, uh, this better be in service of unfucking all of that because out of this month of max subscription I have had a single week where Opus was not a liability between the nosedive 4.5 took before Opus 4.6 and the intentional pants shitting that began last Friday as they presumably started spinning up Sonnet 4.6. And make no mistake that one week was really good, I got things done I had had to punt on for literal years, but I cannot deal with a non deterministic tool that is usable a quarter of the time. And I just use it for code, hearing the way people confide personal shit and relinquish the microscopic vestiges of privacy they have left to AI is, frankly, horrifying when I consider that my experience is that it is passingly competent at best for small, extremely tightly scoped tasks and dangerously inconsistent and unreliable most of the rest of the time.",

      "text": "I use AI every day - developing with LLMs, building AI agents. And you know what? There are things where AI is still helpless. Sharing my observations.\n\n**Large codebases are a nightmare for AI.** Ask it to write one function and you get fire. But give it a 50k+ line project and it forgets your conventions, breaks the architecture, suggests solutions that conflict with the rest of your code. Reality is this: AI doesn't understand the context and intent of your code. MIT CSAIL showed that even \"correct\" AI code can do something completely different from what it was designed for.\n\n**The final 20% of work eats all the time.** AI does 80% of the work in minutes, that's true. But the remaining 20% - final review, edge cases, meeting actual requirements - takes as much time as the entire task used to take.\n\n**Quality vs speed is still a problem.** GitHub and Google say 25-30% of their code is AI-written. But developers complain about inconsistent codebases, convention violations, code that works in isolation but not in the system. The problem is that AI creates technical debt faster than we can pay it off.\n\nTell me I'm wrong, but I see it this way: I myself use Claude Code and other AI tools every day. They're amazing for boilerplate and prototypes. But AI is an assistant, not a replacement for thinking.\n\nIn 2026, the main question is no longer \"Can AI write code?\" but \"Can we trust this code in production?\".\n\nWant to discuss how to properly integrate AI into your development workflow?",

A regular person cannot even successfully *imagine* the right thing to build.\n\nWithout the constant failing that is part of the try-fail learning loop, junior developers will never become senior developers, and if they somehow do, they won't be the same - they'll be missing something.\n\n\n\n",

Especially with vibe coding tools it’s hard to know who is hard in the Dunning-Kruger curve and who has actual experience and knowledge.. of often the more seasoned software engineers are the ones with the least experience with agentic coding.. not least because it’s only gone from complete slop to “actually working” in the past 6 months or so. \n\nI saw the graph of the creator of MoltBot, Peter Steinberger and it mirrored my own journey precisely:\n\nhttps://steipete.me/posts/just-talk-to-it\n\nYou get taken in, feel like the master of the universe, run 18 instances simultaneously, figure out that the quality just isn’t there, learn and take 3 steps back until you have something that is 20% faster than before but not quite as good as if you had put your own mind to it fully.. and continue refining your approach because you know this is the future. \n\nThe biggest problem for me is that I have nearly perfect understanding of the code that I write myself, at least for a while, because I’ve written it myself and I remember each decision, each trade off and I went at human speed. \n\nThat’s gone with agentic coding. On a normal day you take 200 decisions, but none of really well thought out. You nudge the process but you don’t really control it. If you type the same code 5 times, you think “ok this is DNRY”, let’s refactor. You notice small stuff. You’re re-evaluating earlier decisions. You get a feel for the code. \n\nWith high velocity agentic coding the focus is always narrow. Or way too large. You can read the code, but you have no feel for it or how well it fits in. Decisions are temporary. The litmus test is to go in and debug a complex bug yourself: it’s like you’re working on someone else’s code. There may be comments but they’re 200 commits out of date. You find two separate systems doing the same thing.. then the veil lifts and you realize you should have been working on this yourself more and let the agent do less.. but now you’re lazy and spoiled 😔",

          "text": "I understand the point of the post and I believe many people have had that experience, but in my case the situation was quite different — for very specific reasons. The “AI losing context” part you mentioned in the beginning is something I’ve seen too, but in my experience it often comes down to workflow. My process is very structured: I describe the problem, explain how things currently behave vs. how they should behave, and I always ask for a detailed diagnostic report first. The model scans every relevant line connected to the issue and produces a micro-report before any implementation starts. If I introduce a second problem mid-process, sometimes the model temporarily focuses on the newest context and forgets the earlier thread — but that’s not a failure, it’s just how iterative conversations work. I simply stop it, remind it that there are two parallel problems, and once it acknowledges that and reiterates the first issue, I always ask again for a micro-report that covers the implementation impact of both fixes together before moving forward. With that level of guidance, I’ve never had it break my project.\n\nAnd yes — I did have very bad experiences before. With Cursor and GitHub Copilot, where I was exclusively using Claude Opus, my behavior and workflow were identical to what I described above — but it still wasn’t enough. In those cases I experienced at least 10 separate situations where the model literally broke my codebase and disrupted stability.\n\nIn my specific case, the real turning point *was* switching to GPT-5.2 Codex in VS Code. The exact same structured workflow that failed me before finally became stable and predictable. I don’t let AI work autonomously; I frequently stop it, bring it back to the architecture, and keep clear boundaries around what it’s allowed to change. In the root folder of my project I also maintain an MD file that acts as a “law” every agent must follow, with explicitly defined behavioral rules and restrictions. In that setup AI hasn’t created chaos for me — it has accelerated development without compromising the project’s structure. That’s why I don’t see all “AI coding” as the same; the difference between models and communication style makes a huge practical difference.\n\nJust so I’m not misunderstood — I’m not a developer and I never was, but I’m someone who knows in micro detail what I want, how something needs to look, and where I ultimately want to end up. That vision is very clearly defined in my head. Everything I wrote above refers strictly to my work on my own application, which has over 50k lines of code and is so complex that almost every class operates in synergy with others. I hope the Claude community won’t take this the wrong way — this is simply my personal experience while building something extremely complex, and at this point I’m already about 80% through the application.",

          "text": "Posts like this just remind me how far behind the average programmer is from the bleeding edge of what's possible with Agentic Coding today.\n\nThese criticisms applied maybe until late last year - but this year?  Claude Code will run until it meets its verification techniques.  It will loop over itself and check itself for quality, security, common errors, etc.  It will invoke endless static code techniques.   It can run playwright tests and postman tests and iterate on any work it does until the tests all pass (without changing the tests, like it would last year).  Humans can hardly be bothered to run tests at all and instead assume their CI pipelines catch problems.\n\nIt can be told to run, and try to break the system, find bugs, find holes - and it can do this all 24 hours a day - each pass can improve software quality.   First pass maybe not perfect, but 2 passes later? 5? 10?  That can all be done in minutes.\n\nI haven't seen a hallucination since Opus 4.5 came out - 4.6 is incredibly good at staying on task, breaking down problems and tasks into small chunks that compose into sophisticated systems.   Things like Get Shit Done are literal software development engines, all written in markdown that are just prompts and you can one shot complex projects pretty simply with the techniques used there.\n\nIf one can't write high quality code in today's CC/4.6 world than a human, then that's 100% a skill issue.  I see people making these claims who are still using some web ui with copy paste for coding.  I see people using ChatGPT and Gemini or Cursor or CoPilot instead of CC - none of these tools are indicative of the bleeding edge of this technology.\n\nPeople think that just using CC with prompts and in plan mode is on the edge of what's possible - it's not.  The new edge is starting off with a skill that asks what you want to achieve, flushes out all the requirements, ties them to must pass condition (like an api or ux test), writes it all out so it's not forgotten, validates presence of those tests, implements, reviews its work (with different agents), circles back, verifies everything on the list is done, runs quality checks, submits to other agent for final review and auditing, and then at the end of the day stands up a complete test environment and runs the complete suite of API and UX tests against the system to ensure no regressions.\n\nWhat I described just there has always been an ideal way of writing software that I've never seen a human team achieve - but guess what, Claude Code with 4.6 and techniques like [Get Shit Done](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done) can do all this in like 20 minutes and in much higher quality than any human team I've ever seen.\n\nThe people at Github and Google are all dogfooding their own stuff, like AntiGravity and CoPilot (calling Opus 4.6 from these tools is not the same) - so I can see why they're not more productive - but then you have Claude Code which is moving so fast no one can keep up - not even ChatGPT (whose products do suck).\n\nSo if you want to see why people think there's gonna be a massive disruption in tech, you need to learn this stuff - cause it's here and it's been possible and it's catching on fast.   The big contracts that Anthropic have been signing lately (like with Goldman Sachs) are indiciative of how valuable their tech is.\n\nI do believe the others may catch up, but they don't seem to be able to do anything correct (Gemini CLI, Antigravity, CoPilot, Codex) - meanwhile Anthropic just upgrades CC on a near daily basis.",

Now I have a different approach: I use the AI for brainstorming, research and structure. Then, for prototyping and styling, and when I'm good with it, I take it piece by piece, one function at the time. Most of the time I know what I'm doing and I can understand if the code is good or not (not always, I must admit 😁). But I'll get there eventually. Not automatically. Working really hard on it. My purpose is not to use AI to do the work for me, but to be my companion in things that can do faster and better than me. So yes, AI can't replace devs yet, and I don't think that's the point, right?\n(Though, speaking as a designer that collaborated with several devs before and the code I received was not at best quality, the constant reply to my design (mostly UX) decisions was 'that can't be done' but you know, AI never replies like this, as a matter of fact it can do anything! So, AI probably replaced devs for me 😆)",

Letting an LLM or a human loose or a large codebase without planning is a recipe for disaster in both cases. \n\nTbh, this is absolutely not different from what you need to do in software engineering with or without a LLM. It's just faster with an agent. \n\nIt definitely can't replace all developers you still need experience to review the architecture and the output quality but it can replace juniors. I don't know it will ever be able to replace all of them, hopefully I'll retire before we all get fired.\n\nThe reality is that it's getting really hard to work with juniors, they use LLM, produce stuff of low quality they don't understand, barely learn anything and in half the time it takes to review it and actually teach them something if they bother not just copy pasting the code review in an LLM, a senior can redo it correctly from scratch. we've stopped hiring juniors because economically it doesn't make sense anymore. \n\nJust last week we replaced all of our open junior positions with half the number of intermediate to senior positions.

Our old code exercise is trivially defeated by Claude Code because it’s mostly just testing the dev’s basic knowledge and speed. So I’ve come up with a new exercise that relies heavily on spatial reasoning. You have to program a team of robots to deliver packages in a room that has obstacles. It’s a lot like a Zachtronics game, and you get scored on a number of criteria after each attempt.\n\nThe thing is, Claude and Codex generally fail on their first pass if you just say “Look at the level and solve it.”\n\nIf you have them look at the output and try again, they will eventually get a passing score but that can take 10+ minutes and the score is usually pretty bad. And now you’ve burned a ton of your time just to get a bad score. It comes up with plans where robots collide, get stuck for long periods, etc.\n\nBut most humans can look at it and say, “Oh, robot 3 just needs to go up at turn 18 and then go through the top door…” and suddenly you’ve got double the score that the LLM was able to hit.\n\nIn my own testing, I find that I get the best scores when I use a very fast/dumb model and give it a strategy.

The gotcha.. at the moment, there is not a structured name convention.\nI didn't saved the chat but this is what happened.\n\nREQUEST:\nI have the list of files you can read from file `input_list` . I need them to be moved this structure: folder \"title (date)` with inside `filename` where filename is the name they already have.

It included a regex so complex that a second AI could not correctly escape after other 5 interactions.\n\n\nMy conclusion. Opus is good for standard request only and it completely overthink possible solutions. My request was obviously a 1 shot request and the easiest solution should have been a 1500 line file with a `mv` command for each line. Opus didn't even considered this as a possible solution.",

I'm not a senior dev, but have worked in IT for years, and have been using Claude to explore what to me were just buzzwords before but now make much more sense. Like CI/CD pipelines, modular architecture, Unix philosophy, etc. It helps so much to be able to build at turbo speed as a learning experience, and since work lags behind with tools available, I'm excited to have a head start over everyone as we're finally getting claude / gh copilot enterprise seats. \n\nImo it really comes down to spending extra time planning, breaking down your backlog, adding dependencies and file paths for the AI that's going to complete the task, and completing every task on fresh context. Tbh it feels like with agentic AI we're seeing a return of waterfall over Agile since having a detailed plan is so important, and with a detailed plan you can run the build multiple times and just cherry pick the best results.",

And I'm trying to use what I'm learning in that process where AI does work to then understand why it fails in other cases and how we might overcome that. \n\n\nAt the same time, I also would not say that the ability to generate lines of code is not our real limiter either. Yes, there are businesses where this is the case. But I think for many it is not. I'm still trying to think about the likely ratio, but my feeling is that this second group is larger.  \n\n\nIt is about deciding what lines of code to write. Lines of code as measure of worth has always been a poor proxy. And AI is just making that even more obvious.\n\n\nMy biggest fear is the loss of junior devs. There is good evidence that AI is having the biggest impact from more senior devs. Which is not surprising. People who understand systems and architecture are going to be way better at what has become, essentially, an increased focus on requirements gathering and documenting. But the problem with replacing a team of juniors with a senior and a fleet of agents is where does the next generation of senior devs come from?\n\n\nApprenticeship programs are essential. I get that it's not in vogue to think too many quarters ahead, let alone years or decades. But replacing junior devs now with AIs is short sighted. I guess that's modern capitalism though...",

If the whole past lives stuff is true I was probably a really bad bad person , because this is hell man . Work with tech people is the worst .",

Not sure if i can configure tailscale with my domain and also put up access policy like i can with cloudflare. \n\nAgain though will look into how i could maybe use that instead. Would simplify the whole remote setup a lot.\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "I've built a bunch of custom skills for Claude Code. Some are clever. Some are over-engineered. The one I actually use every single session is basically a glorified checklist.\n\nIt's called `wrap-up`. I run it at the end of every working session. It commits code, checks if I learned anything worth remembering, reviews whether Claude made mistakes it should learn from, and flags anything worth publishing. Four phases, fully automated, no approval prompts interrupting the flow.\n\nFull SKILL.md shown at the end of this message. I sanitized paths and project-specific details but the structure is real and unedited.\n\n\n## How this works\n\nThe skill is doing four things.\n\n**Ship It** catches the \"oh I never committed that\" problem. I'm bad about this. I'll do an hour of work, close the laptop, and realize the next day nothing got pushed. Now Claude just does it.\n\n**Remember It** is where the compounding happens. Claude has a memory hierarchy (CLAUDE.md, rules, auto memory, local notes) and most people never use it deliberately. This phase forces a review: \"did we learn anything that should persist?\" Over weeks, your setup gets smarter without you thinking about it.\n\n**Review & Apply** is the one that surprised me. I added it half-expecting it to be useless. But Claude actually catches real patterns. \"You asked me to do X three times today that I should've done automatically.\" Then it writes the rule and commits it. Self-improving tooling with zero effort from me.\n\n**Publish It** is the newest phase. Turns out a lot of sessions produce something worth sharing and I just... never get around to it. Now Claude flags it, drafts it, and saves it. I still decide whether to post, but the draft is there instead of lost in a conversation I'll never reopen.\n\n## The meta point\n\nThe best skills aren't the ones that do impressive things. They're the ones that run the boring routines you'd skip. Every session that ends with `/wrap-up` leaves my projects a little more organized, my Claude setup a little smarter, and occasionally produces a blog post I didn't plan to write.\n\n---\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: wrap-up\ndescription: Use when user says \"wrap up\", \"close session\", \"end session\",\n  \"wrap things up\", \"close out this task\", or invokes /wrap-up — runs\n  end-of-session checklist for shipping, memory, and self-improvement\n---\n\n# Session Wrap-Up\n\nRun four phases in order. Each phase is conversational and inline — no\nseparate documents. All phases auto-apply without asking; present a\nconsolidated report at the end.\n\n## Phase 1: Ship It\n\n**Commit:**\n1. Run `git status` in each repo directory that was touched during the session\n2. If uncommitted changes exist, auto-commit to main with a descriptive message\n3. Push to remote\n\n**File placement check:**\n4. If any files were created or saved during this session:\n   - Verify they follow your naming convention\n   - Auto-fix naming violations (rename the file)\n   - Verify they're in the correct subfolder per your project structure\n   - Auto-move misplaced files to their correct location\n5. If any document-type files (.md, .docx, .pdf, .xlsx, .pptx) were created\n   at the workspace root or in code directories, move them to the docs folder\n   if they belong there\n\n**Deploy:**\n6. Check if the project has a deploy skill or script\n7. If one exists, run it\n8. If not, skip deployment entirely — do not ask about manual deployment\n\n**Task cleanup:**\n9. Check the task list for in-progress or stale items\n10. Mark completed tasks as done, flag orphaned ones\n\n## Phase 2: Remember It\n\nReview what was learned during the session. Decide where each piece of\nknowledge belongs in the memory hierarchy:\n\n**Memory placement guide:**\n- **Auto memory** (Claude writes for itself) — Debugging insights, patterns\n  discovered during the session, project quirks. Tell Claude to save these:\n  \"remember that...\" or \"save to memory that...\"\n- **CLAUDE.md** (instructions for Claude) — Permanent project rules,\n  conventions, commands, architecture decisions that should guide all future\n  sessions\n- **`.claude/rules/`** (modular project rules) — Topic-specific instructions\n  that apply to certain file types or areas. Use `paths:` frontmatter to scope\n  rules to relevant files (e.g., testing rules scoped to `tests/**`)\n- **`CLAUDE.local.md`** (private per-project notes) — Personal WIP context,\n  local URLs, sandbox credentials, current focus areas that shouldn't be\n  committed\n- **`@import` references** — When a CLAUDE.md would benefit from referencing\n  another file rather than duplicating its content\n\n**Decision framework:**\n- Is it a permanent project convention? → CLAUDE.md or `.claude/rules/`\n- Is it scoped to specific file types? → `.claude/rules/` with `paths:`\n  frontmatter\n- Is it a pattern or insight Claude discovered? → Auto memory\n- Is it personal/ephemeral context? → `CLAUDE.local.md`\n- Is it duplicating content from another file? → Use `@import` instead\n\nNote anything important in the appropriate location.\n\n## Phase 3: Review & Apply\n\nAnalyze the conversation for self-improvement findings. If the session was\nshort or routine with nothing notable, say \"Nothing to improve\" and proceed\nto Phase 4.\n\n**Auto-apply all actionable findings immediately** — do not ask for approval\non each one. Apply the changes, commit them, then present a summary of what\nwas done.\n\n**Finding categories:**\n- **Skill gap** — Things Claude struggled with, got wrong, or needed multiple\n  attempts\n- **Friction** — Repeated manual steps, things user had to ask for explicitly\n  that should have been automatic\n- **Knowledge** — Facts about projects, preferences, or setup that Claude\n  didn't know but should have\n- **Automation** — Repetitive patterns that could become skills, hooks, or\n  scripts\n\n**Action types:**\n- **CLAUDE.md** — Edit the relevant project or global CLAUDE.md\n- **Rules** — Create or update a `.claude/rules/` file\n- **Auto memory** — Save an insight for future sessions\n- **Skill / Hook** — Document a new skill or hook spec for implementation\n- **CLAUDE.local.md** — Create or update per-project local memory\n\nPresent a summary after applying, in two sections — applied items first,\nthen no-action items:\n\nFindings (applied):\n\n1. ✅ Skill gap: Cost estimates were wrong multiple times\n   → [CLAUDE.md] Added token counting reference table\n\n2. ✅ Knowledge: Worker crashes on 429/400 instead of retrying\n   → [Rules] Added error-handling rules for worker\n\n3. ✅ Automation: Checking service health after deploy is manual\n   → [Skill] Created post-deploy health check skill spec\n\n---\nNo action needed:\n\n4. Knowledge: Discovered X works this way\n   Already documented in CLAUDE.md\n\n## Phase 4: Publish It\n\nAfter all other phases are complete, review the full conversation for material\nthat could be published. Look for:\n\n- Interesting technical solutions or debugging stories\n- Community-relevant announcements or updates\n- Educational content (how-tos, tips, lessons learned)\n- Project milestones or feature launches\n\n**If publishable material exists:**\n\nDraft the article(s) for the appropriate platform and save to a drafts folder.\nPresent suggestions with the draft:\n\nAll wrap-up steps complete. I also found potential content to publish:\n\n1. \"Title of Post\" — 1-2 sentence description of the content angle.\n   Platform: Reddit\n   Draft saved to: Drafts/Title-Of-Post/Reddit.md\n\nWait for the user to respond. If they approve, post or prepare per platform.\nIf they decline, the drafts remain for later.\n\n**If no publishable material exists:**\n\nSay \"Nothing worth publishing from this session\" and you're done.\n\n**Scheduling considerations:**\n- If the session produced multiple publishable items, do not post them all\n  at once\n- Space posts at least a few hours apart per platform\n- If multiple posts are needed, post the most time-sensitive one now and\n  present a schedule for the rest\n```\n",

Wanted to check if your experience matches.\n\nclaude/rules/ files with paths: frontmatter appear to load at startup regardless of scoping (GitHub issue https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/16299). So routing learnings to scoped rules doesn't actually save context tokens over putting them in CLAUDE.md\n\nThis means the only truly on-demand (zero startup cost) destination is auto memory topic files (\\~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/debugging.md, etc.), with MEMORY.md acting as a concise index that tells Claude when to read each topic file.\n\nIn your usage, have you noticed .claude/rules/ with paths: actually behaving conditionally, or does everything load at startup for you too?\n\nYour memory placement guide routes \"patterns and insights Claude discovered\" to auto memory. In practice, does Claude reliably read the topic files on demand when MEMORY.md indexes them well? Or do you find important things get missed because Claude doesn't bother reading the topic file?\n\nWould love to hear if this matches your real-world experience or if I'm overthinking the token cost angle.

We had to set hard limits (15 session log entries max) and force aggressive pruning or the file becomes too noisy to be useful.

The missing piece at the moment for me is the \"changes\" UI - I want to be able to select fragments of that for contextual discussion, and can't. \n\nAnother issue with the changes window is text overflow missing, have to horizontal scroll a lot. I have to keep vscode open to really be able to review changes well. At this point, having it as a vscode plugin would be really handy - but if they were solved, it'd be standalone.\n\nThose two nitpicks are the only thing that's making me keep vscode running alongside.\n\nSyntax highlighting / jump to code functionality in the chat window would be very useful as well.\n\nBut great work, the ability to interact with a session from mobile is a massive level-up for me - will keep a close eye on this.",
