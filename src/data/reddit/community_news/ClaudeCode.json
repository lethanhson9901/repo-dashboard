It scans for adversarial instructions in email text, checks for hidden text in HTML (such as white text on a white background), and analyzes behavioral context to see if an email is trying to manipulate an AI into unsafe actions.\n* **SentinelOne:** SentinelOne’s autonomous security platform detects and stops indirect prompt injections in real time by monitoring for malicious instructions embedded in external content like emails.\n* **Trend Vision One™ ZTSA (AI Service Access):** This tool provides advanced prompt injection detection by monitoring AI usage, inspecting prompts and responses, and analyzing AI content to prevent potential manipulation.\n* **Azure AI Content Safety (Prompt Shields):** Microsoft provides \"Prompt Shields\" which act as a unified API to analyze inputs for both direct and indirect prompt injection attacks, particularly effective for protecting LLM-based applications.\n* **DataDog LLM Observability:** This tool includes default scanning rules and \"out-of-the-box\" security checks that can flag prompt injections by identifying semantic similarity with known jailbreaks, allowing for inspection of full traces in the Datadog UI. \n\ni looked at qwen guard model but it doesn’t classify or check for prompt injections.",

Not that I can solve it practically, but I don’t see why Anthropic can’t. \n\nIf you think about it, it’s the same in real life; the most simple example being, you teach kids, don’t open the front door! At some point your kids start telling you that there is someone at the door so you can open it, beyond that they ask “who is it?” and if is mum or dad they let them in. Next, they eventually learn that when mum and dad are expecting a friend over they can answer the door, but when the open it if the Persian standing behind the peep hole is wearing a hockey mask and holding a chainsaw, they don’t open it, and finally at the point the nativity fades enough that the can defend the door, at least in a battle of intents if not physically they may open the door freely and decide what to do themselves. \n\nThe key is that it begins with knowing who you can trust! Sure someone might answer “it’s dad” In dad’s voice and gain entry through deception but that wouldn’t work if you gave your child a 2FA or a crypto signing tool for every door request, would it?\n\nYou can extrapolate that example to employees and beyond, and yeah, employees whose bosses have their email hacked do stupid shit all the time! But that proves the issue is one of identity and knowing what functions have consequences your boss wants a say in!!\n\nI might put Claude code to task of building a system 😂 it already has hooks that are forced to run before and after a tool use!",

      "text": "Last thursday my company told us to wrap up whatever we were doing by friday's eod because we were starting something new. I thought they were going to give a new project, but no, it’s worse. I found out this monday that we're starting to use Claude, *for everything*. And when I say for everything, I mean *everything*. The PMs are going to use it to ask for feedback on product decisions. The designers to churn out designs in Figma. And of course, us programmers are plugging it into the IDE so it spits out code.\n\nI've always been skeptical of AI for coding, but claude actually does it pretty well. That said, using it to this extreme... I don't know if that's the right move.\n\nBut anyway, here I am. I'm watching some videos on prompt engineering and tokens and honestly, I want to blow my brains out. They're all nonsense videos telling you how to draft sentences so the AI god pays attention to you. I mean, things like context and keeping it focused make sense, but still.\n\nThe company is dedicating the next two weeks to this \"hackathon\" using Claude, where we have to implement features using it and see what happens. They also gave us subscriptions to [traycer](https://traycer.ai/) for planning and specs, [coderabbit](https://www.coderabbit.ai/) for reviews, and suggested we request more tools if we need any.\n\nCan anyone recommend any reading material? Has anyone gone through something like this at their company? What was the result?",

If it does something stupid that's a repo wide issue (linting. test generation, organization requirement, etc), tell Claude to put it in the repo CLAUDE.md to always do it that way.  (Aside: always tell Claude to maintain is own files).  If it's specific to you, tell it to put it in your home directory version, or just use memory: # don't ever do that again, do this instead. \n\nEventually you'll build up enough rules to factor out logic into skills where it's appropriate (colocating Jíra knowledge specific to your company) but for now just keep putting in guard rails.\n\nAs you add guards be very careful how you phrase things.  It's a literal dum-dum sometimes.  Logic conflicts just mean it's going to pick something some statistical probability of the time.  So make sure the repo CLAUDE.md and skills don't disagree with your personal ones.  If they do, tell Claude it's very important to always use one.  Again, tell Claude to maintain it, not your job to figure out its config files.\n\nWhen you develop, ask more questions than you give commands.  If you tell it what to do, it'll do it.  If you ask if that's the right way to solve it. It'll think and tell you when you're wrong.\n\nAdd context7 mcp.  Install ccstatusline to monitor context.  I also use ripgrep by recommendation but I'm not sure it's necessary.  I avoid all other mcps (though I turn on Figma as necessary).  It's perfectly capable of handling Jíra (acli) and GitHub(gh) through cli commands.  Unless you use custom fields in Jíra where acli fails miserably (whole side rant on that).  Goal though is to leave context for work, not for system APIs.\n\nStart each work session in plan mode, make sure it's exactly what you want.  Newer versions will ask to dump context and execute the plan.  It's a little aggressive for me so I'll let it ride under 100k.  Beyond that you run the risk of compacting.  It's usually better to dump the plan to .MD file, clear, and reload it than compact (time saver).  If you have a really complex plan writing to file the implementation milestones and updating it to clear periodically is your only real option.  This is often where I reach for Codex because I don't have patience for being Claude's nanny.\n\nWhen you get comfortable on your own, start figuring out what to automate with skills.  If you do some mundane task every ticket/PR, tell Claude you want a skill for it.  It's lowk \"take my job\" level of paranoia inducing, but if you teach it to think like you, it'll do what you want.\n\nFTR I use Opus daily.  Experience may vary with Sonnet, but the overall guidance is the same.  Train it as you go and you'll be surprised how quickly you're focusing on what to solve, not how to solve it.",

The industry is changing whether we like it or not and companies are realising that if they don't keep up then they will get left behind. The last thing your company wants to do is close down and fire everyone. You should be thankful that they're not firing everyone and keeping a few that can be more productive with AI. They still value you which is a very nice feeling to have when working for a company. It just is what it is now and we need to embrace it. AI is here to stay and it's only going to get better. The speed at which technology is changing now is hard to digest for most people like it wasn't already a challenge keeping up to date with the latest technology before. As a developer, you're already further ahead than most people. Your skills are transferable and you can still be the person people come to for advice and results because you have the experience and knowledge. The not so savvy tech indivuduals aren't going to steer AI and get the same results that you will. They will be better at using it for other things for sure which is why your company wants to use it across the board now.  Yeah sandy in HR might make a helpful app to sift through all of her compliance work but you will be the guy to set it up, host it, secure it, ensure it runs smoothly, eradicate the bugs etc. It's not as bad as people think.

Like an arbitrary function that will do anything you ask of it if that makes sense and it has actually made it really fun again. I had 53 custom claude agents running in a bash loop the other day researching an open source framework repo and it's documentation for features I have planned to explore how they've implemented it and each would come up with 3 implementation options based on MY requirements and methodologies. I've had several scripts gluing all of this together and now have fully researched specs, their dependencies and an implementation order broken down into small tasks. By the end of this week I'll have scripted several agents to complete those tasks, perform code analysis, security audits, QA automation, test writing, manual browser testing. All the shit that we would like to do but can't because of resource constraints but now we can. It's fucking amazing.\n\nAll of those tools your company is paying for.

This is why this needs to happen because everyone will start doing this and those saas companies that rely on all of their clients will have to shift their value proposition too. To prevent their own collapse.\n\nContext, knowledge and data are the new gold standard since software can be easily cloned now within weeks.\n\nThe framework I was researching has been around for 7 years. I came up with the idea two weeks ago, by the end of this week I'll have it completely built. I made a version 1 proof of concept in a single evening with a demo app and tests to test the idea first. It only has 3 dependencies, the runtime, the underlying web framework and a small metadata library. All of this, from 1 developer with a computer in less than 3 weeks and I'm not even going as fast as I could. It's more performant, more efficient to run and has all of the same features without losing DX.\n\nAnd it's one of like 5 or 6 projects I'm working on.",

Log the fuck out of that too!

Yes it sneakily puts in fallback options anyway 🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️\n\n-Fallback options, make it much harder to debug.\n\n-Claude fatigue is real. Step away, come back tomorrow and take it from there.

This is a real gateway drug to using AI for more.\n\nWork in small chunks, don't be afraid to throw it all out and start fresh, the context window can get weird.  Fast iterations often beats building on mistakes. Sure it's an expensive use of tokens, but you're not paying the bills, right?\n\nCheckpoint good work. Commit the wip and move on to the next round. AI goes rogue pretty quick, it's always good to checkpoint.\n\nMarkdown and tests keep it on task, but it won't build it unless you ask.  Organize your files don't spray shit everywhere. The AI will also over-specify which can make change in future more difficult, so don't feel bad about culling what it writes.\n\nDon't cheat by having it do all the thinking. Your domain knowledge and architectural design is as important as ever. Class leakage, single responsibility, usage of patterns, AI will make bad design choices and cram hacks in because the user asks for something that requires violating the established patterns.

I still direct it to the type of output I want, but it saves a bunch of time having it do the writing, build charts and graphics, etc.  I can write policies or instructions, iterate with it to come up with procedures, write emails if I need it to or whatever. \n\nI got more into \"vibe coding\" this year and have it building tools for me and basic apps.  It's crazy how much time I spent digging through python docs for various libraries and spending an ungodly amount of time on that stuff and now it's done in a day.  Today  I found out something about our setup was effed up and it would have taken someone a week or so to manually fix the stuff.  I just built a small app in a matter of hours to automate the fixes and it runs in a few seconds.  \n\nThe time savings is really good and the quality of your work goes up so I would definitely dive into it.

Just ask Claude to think about how it could create one for your code base. I use a python exec mcp so Claude can execute python an load the dictionary as well as wile the powers of creation wherever I need him to.\n\n2. Use Claude to help u create specifications and then have it code by following this specs either Claude code or opus 4.5 directly. U may need a python exec mcp to make that Ai reference work or u could try and implement the concept in a different language. Anyways, good luck…",

One thing that would make it even stronger in my opinion is to make it truly “Open” in terms of usage, especially for non-technical users like PMs / POs who are often the ones writing or validating specs.\nFor example, having native or simple integrations with tools like Jira (or other project tracking tools) would be a huge win. That would allow product people to write and review specs where they already work, while keeping OpenSpec as the source of truth, instead of requiring them to go through a CLI or repo-centric workflow.\nThat said, I’ve only been using OpenSpec for about 3 weeks, so I’m still lacking some long-term perspective.

          "text": "The best way to learn Claude Code is to flip your instincts. Instead of doing something yourself and then asking Claude to help, ask Claude to do it first and watch how it approaches the problem.\n\nSounds backwards, but you learn the tool's capabilities way faster by seeing what it can handle autonomously. Start with small tasks - 'refactor this function' or 'add tests for this module' - and gradually increase scope as you build trust in what it can do unsupervised.\n\nThe mental shift from 'AI as autocomplete' to 'AI as junior dev I'm supervising' is what unlocks the real productivity gains. You'll be surprised how much you can delegate once you stop reflexively reaching for the keyboard first.",

You can basically completely create your own interface for working, both in the main editor and quick overlays you can make.  You can turn containers into accordions, tabs, or regular splits.  Has an mcp with full control over the ide.\n\nI havnt decided what I’m doing with it yet, I just made it for my own use because none of the other IDE’s do what I want.   I might open source it but I’m not sure. I also found issues with how Claude code and codex work, so I made my own versions (plus gui wrappers for Claude code, codex, and Gemini cli)",

      "text": "NOTE: this is longer than I thought it would be, but it was not written with the assistance of Artificial (or Real) Intelligence.\n\nFirst of all - I'm not saying Opus 4.5 performance hasn't degraded over the last few weeks. I'm not saying it has either, I'm just not making a claim either way.\n\nBut...\n\nThere are a bunch of common mistakes/suboptimal practices I see people discuss in the same threads where they, or others, are complaining about said nerfdom. So, I thought I'd share some tips that I, and others, have shared in those threads. If you're already doing this stuff - awesome. If you're already doing this stuff and still see degradation, then that sucks.\n\nSo - at the core of all this is one inescapable truth - by their very nature, LLMs are unpredictable. No matter how good a model is, and how well it responds to you today, it will likely behave differently tomorrow. Or in 5 minutes. I've spent many hours now designing tools and workflows to mitigate this. So have others. Before you rage-post about Opus, or cancel your subscription, please take a minute to work out whether maybe there's something you can do first to improve your experience. Here are some suggestions:\n\n**Limit highly interactive \"pair programming\" sessions with Claude.**\n\nYou know the ones where you free-flow like Claude's your best buddy. If you are feeling some kind of camaraderie with Claude, then you're probably falling into this trap. If you're sick of being *absolutely right* \\- this one is for you.\n\nWhy? Everything in this mode is completely unpredictable. Your inputs, the current state of the context window, the state of the code, your progress in our task, and of course, our friend Opus might be having a bad night too.\n\nYou are piling entropy onto the shaky foundation of nondeterminism. Don't be surprised if a slight wobble from Opus brings your house of cards falling down.\n\nSo, what's the alternative? We'll get to that in a minute.\n\n**Configure your CC status line to show % context consumed**\n\nI did this ages ago with [ccstatusline](https://github.com/sirmalloc/ccstatusline) \\- I have no idea if there's a cooler way of doing it now. But it's critical for everything below.\n\n**DO NOT go above 40-50% of your context window and expect to have a good time.** \n\nYour entire context window gets sent to the LLM with every message you send. All of it. And it has to process all of it to understand how to respond.\n\nYou should think of everything in there as either signal or noise. LLMs do best when the context window is densely packed with signal. And to make things worse - what was signal 5 prompts ago, is now noise. If your chat your way to 50% context window usage, I'd bet money that only a small amount of context is useful. And the models won't do a good job of understanding what's signal and what's noise. Hence they forget stuff suddenly, even with 50% left. In short Context Rot happens sooner than you think.\n\nThat's why I wince whenever I read about people disabling auto-compact and pushing all the way to 100%. You're basically force feeding your agent Mountain Dew and expecting it to piss champagne.\n\n**Use subagents.**\n\nThe immaculately mustached Dexter Horthy once said \"subagents are not for playing House.md\". Or something like that. And as he often is, he was right. In short, subagents use their own context window and do not pollute your main agent's. Just tell claude to \"use multiple subagents to do X,Y,Z\". Note: I have seen that backgrounding multiple subagents fills up the parent’s context window - so be careful of that. Also - they're context efficient but token inefficient (at least in the short term) - so know your limits.\n\n**Practice good hygiene**\n\nKeep your CLAUDE.md (including those in parent directories) tight. Use Rules/Skills. Clean up MCPs (less relevant with [Tool Search](https://x.com/trq212/status/2011523109871108570) though). All in the name of keeping that sweet sweet signal/noise ratio in a good place.\n\n**One Claude Session == One Task. Simple.**\n\nBreak up big tasks. This is software engineering 101. I don't have a mathematical formula for this, but I get concerned what I see tasks that I think could be more than \\~1 days work for a human engineer. That's kind of size that can get done by Claude in \\~15-20 mins. If there is a lot of risks/unknowns, I go smaller, because I'm likely to end up iterating some.\n\nTo do this effectively, you need to externalize where you keep your tasks/issues, There are a bunch of ways to do this. I'll mention three...\n\n1. .md files littered across your computer and (perhaps worse) your codebase. If this is your thing, go for it. A naive approach: you can fire up a new claude instance and ask it to read a markdown file and start working on it. Update it with your learnings, decisions and progress as you go along. Once you hit \\~40% context window usage, `/clear` and ask Claude to read it again. If you've been updating it, that .md file will be full of really dense signal and you'll be in a great place to continue again. Once you're done, commit, push, drink, smoke, whatever - BUT CLOSE YOUR SESSION (or `/clear` again) and move on with your life (to the next .md file).\n2. [Steve Yegge's Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads)™. I don't know how this man woke up one day and pooped these beads out of you know where, but yet, here we are. People love *Steve Yegge's Beads*™. It's basically a much more capable and elegant way of doing the markdown craziness, backed by JSONL and SQLite, soon to be something else. Work on a task, land the plane, rinse and repeat. But watch that context window. Oh, actually Claude now has the whole Task Manager thing - so maybe use that instead. It's very similar. But less beady. And, for the love of all things holy don't go down the *Steve Yegge's Gas Town*™ rabbit hole. (Actually maybe you should).\n3. Use an issue tracker. Revolutionary I know. For years we've all used issue trackers, but along come agents and we forget all about them - fleeing under the cover of dark mode to the warm coziness of a luxury markdown comforter. Just install your issue tracker's CLI or MCP and add a note your claude.md to use it. Then say \"start issue 5\" or whatever. Update it with progress, and as always, DO NOT USE MORE THAN \\~40-50% context window. Just /clear and ask the agent to read the issue/PR again. This is great for humans working with other humans as well as robots. But it's slower and not as slick as *Steve Yegge's Beads*™.\n\n**Use a predictable workflow**\n\nAre you still here? That's nice of you. Remember that alternative to \"pair programming\" that I mentioned all the way up there? This is it. This will make the biggest difference to your experience with Claude and Opus.\n\nKeep things predictable - use the same set of prompts to guide you through a consistent flow for each thing you work on. You only really change the inputs into the flow. I recommend a \"research, plan, implement, review, drink\" process. Subagents for each step. Persisting your progress each step of the way in some external source (see above). Reading the plans yourself. Fixing misalignment quickly. Don't get all buddy buddy with Claude. Claude ain't your friend. Claude told me he would probably sit on your chest and eat your face if he could. Be flexible, but cold and transactional. Like *Steve Yegge's Beads*™.\n\nThere are a bunch of tools out there that facilitate some form of this. There's [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers), [GSD](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done), and [one that I wrote](https://iloom.ai/). Seriously - [So](https://github.com/Priivacy-ai/spec-kitty). [Fucking](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec). [Many](https://github.com/github/spec-kit). You have no excuse.\n\nAlso, and this is important: when things go wrong, reflect on what you could have changed. Code is cheap - throw it away, tweak your prompts or inputs and just start again. My most frustrating moments with Claude have been caused by too much ambiguity in a task description, or accidental misdirection. [Ralph Wiggum dude](https://ghuntley.com/) called this Human On The Loop instead of *In* the loop. By the way, loop all or some of the above workflow in separate claude instances and you get the aforementioned loop.\n\n\\--------\n\nDoing some or all of the above will not completely protect you from the randomness of working with LLMs, BUT it will give Opus a much more stable foundation to work on - and when *you know who* throws a wobbly, you might barely feel it.\n\nBonus for reading to the end: did you know you can use `:q` to quit CC? It’s like muscle memory for me, and quicker than `/q` because it doesn’t try to load the command menu.",

If I had two drills, one old and one new, with the new one drilling holes faster and through more material but didn't work the same each time I used it, I'd use the old predictable one because I need consistency. \n\nThe same thing is true with LLMs, of course there's built in variation, each word can be a different symbol that looks different in vectors, that being said when competing LLMs don't have the same degradation drift and offer a more predictable and consistent experience, I'm going to use them, even if they weren't as good as Claude Code used to be. Who wants to constantly baby and fidget with a tool that's supposed to help me? I don't. \n\nWe shouldn't have loyalty to these companies, we should be loyal to the tools that help us do what we have to do without becoming a problem on their own.",

              "text": "Variation, like you mentioned, is a natural byproduct of LLMs in general. The incorrect answer will always be a valid possible answer. This chance for an incorrect result is why we see so much perplexity and unique combinations from the models, and is more a feature than a bug.\n\nGranted, we're coders and we're seeking deterministic solutions, but the underlying tech makes that impossible, so the next best thing is minimizing the situation the best way possible (and this writeup did a good job of pointing out where that can happen.)\n\nHumans are much the same way. Get 5 good coders in a room, you'll probably get 3 good solutions to a problem, and a couple that need work. One person might have even misunderstood the goal and built the wrong thing. Being good never meant being perfect.\n\nConsistency? I'm a dev with pretty severe ADHD. Consistency was never my jam, but I've always been gainfully employed. I'm not sure we can demand consistency from an LLM that was literally modeled after humans if humans are the furthest thing from consistent. \n\nIt's also necessary to acknowledge that the tools aren't production ready. We're all out here using pre-alpha software of a tech that isn't even mature. The beginning of the internet was the same thing. Netscape didn't just blink into existence, and was a labor of love between a pair of guys that saw the same consistency issues with NCSA Mosaic browser. \n\nSo they built their own client software to distribute. So did a lot of folks, but if you wanted any new functionality whatsoever, that was going to be you doing it unless you were happy waiting for someone else to get around to it. The part you're requesting? A consistent user experience based off mature tooling? Doesn't exist. If you want it to exist, you need to create it or wait for someone else to.",

Keep prompts crisp and bounded:\n\t\n•\tWhat to change\n\t\n•\tWhere to change it\n\t\n•\tAcceptance criteria / tests\n\n**7) Subagents for exploration; main agent for execution**\n\t\n•\tUse subagents to dig docs/options and keep the main thread clean.\n\t\n•\tBe aware: this can increase token usage.\n\n**8) Hygiene pass (quick wins)**\n\t\n•\tTrim CLAUDE.md and any parent-directory rules.\n\t\n•\tRemove stale instructions. Keep only rules you truly want applied every time.\n\n**9) When it gets “weird” — restart fast**\n\t\n•\tDon’t argue with a confused session. Reset quickly and reload from your externalized state.\n\n**10) Commit / backup more often than you think**\n\t\n•\tFrequent commits/checkpoints make it painless to recover from a drifted session.",

I find the Claude being served to Cursor FAR superior to using the official app—either the desktop app or Claude Code does MUCH worse than what I achieve on cursor. Cursor has a great agentic setup now and an excellent RAG system with better context management but what I'm speaking to right now goes beyond that. The model on Cursor is VASTLY less censored than even on the API which is supposedly the raw model without an Anthropic approved system prompt.",

      "text": "I just want to say \"thanks\" to whoever is riding Opus 4.5 into the ground on $4600 x20 subs, because at this point Opus 4.5 feels like it's performing on the same level as Sonnet 4.5, or even worse in some cases.\n\n\n\nBack in December, Opus 4.5 was honestly insane. I was one of the people defending it and telling others it was just a skill issue if they thought Sonnet was better. Now I'm looking at the last couple of weeks and it really doesn't feel like a skill issue at all, it feels like a straight up downgrade.\n\n\n\nFor the last two weeks Opus 4.5 has been answering on roughly Sonnet 4.5 level, and sometimes below. It legit feels like whatever \"1T parameter monster\" they were selling got swapped out for something like a 4B active parameter model. The scale of the degradation feels like 80–95%, not some tiny tweak.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Sonnet 4.5 actually surprised me in a good way. It definitely feels a bit nerfed, but if I had to put a number on it, maybe around 20% drop at worst, not this complete brain wipe. It still understands what I want most of the time and stays usable as a coding partner.\n\n\n\nOpus on the other hand just stopped understanding what I want:\n\n\\- it keeps mixing up rows of buttons in UI tasks\n\n\\- it ignores rules and conventions I clearly put into [claude.md](http://claude.md) or the system prompt\n\n\\- it confidently says it did something while just skipping steps\n\n\n\nI've been using Claude Code since the Sonnet 3.7 days, so this is not my first rodeo with this tool. I know how to structure projects, how to give it context, how to chunk tasks. I don't have a bunch of messy MSP hacks or some cursed setup. Same environment, same workflow, and in that exact setup Sonnet 4.5 is mostly fine while Opus 4.5 feels like a random unstable beta.\n\n\n\nAnd then I recently read about this guy who's \"vibecoding\" on pedals with insane usage like it's a sport. Thanks to clowns like that, it honestly feels like normal devs can't use these models at full power anymore, because everything has to be throttled, rate limited or quietly nerfed to keep that kind of abuse somewhat under control.\n\n\n\nFrom my side it really looks like a deliberate downgrade pattern: ship something amazing, build hype, then slowly \"optimize\" it until people start asking if they're hallucinating the drop in quality. And judging by other posts and bug reports, I'm clearly not the only one seeing this.\n\n\n\nSo if you're sitting there thinking \"maybe I just don't know how to use Opus properly\" – honestly, it's probably not you. Something under the hood has definitely been touched in a way that makes it way less reliable than it was in December.",

I’m on highest tier plans on both, and I swear, I’d dump Opus 4.5 at the door if Codex 5.2 was much faster! I have to use extra high, or it’s just as nerfed as Opus is. \n\nAnyone have a better idea?",

I read that GPT 5.2 XHigh was VERY good with algo/math stuff, CC 4.5 Opus still best for 95% of coding, and Gemini great at plans. So  I paid the $200 for GPT2.5 to get it to \"review\" what CC says.. poke holes, respond.. then feed that back in to CC. Only problem for me is the 5.2 seems to go for hours and then fails. I upload a few source files (13 to 20 files tops), a prompt, some \"results\" CC came up with.. and send GPT on its way.. and man.. it goes for HOURS and usually fails. Just hangs. No response for 2+ hours.. I finally refresh.. and it starts again. If I type ANYTHING it starts again. VERY frustrating because I am unclear wtf I am doing wrong. CC just works.. I can stop it, not lose anything, not lose context.. add to it, etc. GPT seems to forget everything and start fresh every time I resubmit. I explained that to GPT and Gemini.. both said \"Tell it to return stuff sooner\" basically.. which I did.. basically \"while you work on this can you respond with updates every 10 to 15 mins so I know what is going on\". It says it will, it never does. So.. I dont know WTF is going on. The few times I DID get it to respond, I folded that back in to Claude and it seems to have worked well enough.  Claude usually responds with \"GPT is spot  on.. this is great.. I missed this..\" etc.",

It also gravitates towards reading very small 20-line segments of the current file, and misses important things elsewhere in it.\n\nThe problem is absolutely that they have gone way too overboard with optimizing Code, which doesn't allow Opus to perform at its full power. They need to either revert the optimizations, or instruct Opus to use explore agents every time it needs to understand something, no matter how small.",

So, Claude Code uses a local claude.json file for config, and for some people this file can get corrupted. Keep in mind, this file is local, so Claude for Desktop has a separate one from Web Claude which has a separate one from your VSCode extension or terminal Claude, which explains why it can perform differently for different platforms for the same user account. \n\nThis file can get corrupted in several ways, so I’d recommend checking it to ensure it’s in order. You should see either practically nothing or just global config settings (having nothing in the file is normal, this file is actually NOT meant to store memory or conversations, just settings you’ve updated and MCP servers you’ve added, along with other config info)\n\nThere are also several other .json configuration files that govern Claude Code so maybe look into those as well.

I use Opus sparingly in CC, mostly Sonnet for planning and Haiku for execution of simple tasks. \n\nI have a basic GirHub copilot subscription at $10/mo that I use quite often to stretch my CC limits. I am considering picking up CODEX/GPT again for a couple months with a discount offer. I haven't had a sub for a few months and would like to see how it's evolved. \n\nI've been leaning into CLI over IDE for agent orchestration and tools with GitHub integrations for workflow automation. Writing detailed GH issues then assigning to an agent that does the work, creates a PR, another agent does PR review. I'm not letting them merge and deploy yet. \n\nI'd like to try Opus in full throttle to see if it's everything it's claimed to be, but it's only a bit smarter than the closest competitors; GPT 5.2 and Gemini 3 are both strong coders. Beyond the model, the app is what's doing the context management,  system prompts, and tool use. Each has its own opinionated SDD implementation that weighs heavily on overall quality. \n\nI encourage devs to try different tools, they are rapidly evolving and borrowing best ideas from each other. Hopefully we see more standards emerge like AGENTS.md, Skills, MCP, A2A. I'd love to see something like CC hooks more widely available.",

They co-developed AWS' new bifurcated AI chips (Trainium/Inferentia), and Amazon is building huge new facilities entirely for their use (including one with a million Trainium chips for creating their next generation of models) \n\nSo when you use Claude, you're getting served the same model from two different platforms: Google Cloud's TPUs (which Anthropic relied on until now) or Inferentia. I'm not sure if that's handled on a per-session or per-prompt basis, although I'd guess it's per-session. I suspect this is the explanation: one of the two probably performs more poorly at the present, and the service you're more likely to be routed to probably varies on a daily basis due to any number of factors\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wqn7rcf9vdgg1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e201b1acdcebda25989ba21a783cec65456ec49",

We have no idea what variant of the advertised model they're running, and more importantly, if or when it changes. The usage post the other day, which suggests weekly limit is indeed around 20x but the monthly is only 10x  shows this gap again. There's nothing preventing them from doing this; nor serving a less capable variant at will. If they do this a/b testing style, how could we even possibly detect this?\n\nFor example, from their [post mortem](http://anthropic.com) post: \"Our aim is that users should get the same quality responses **regardless of which platform serves their request**\".  I don't think the actual platform they run their infra was anyone's worry at all. Have they ever even denied to be servings quantized models? If they weren't, why would they not say so, especially in a post recognizing and addressing degraded performance reports?\n\nWhat exactly is preventing model providers from acting like a street dealer offering the hook-them-up version of a drug?",

You would need to sample different types of account, different locations, different times of days, etc. to even have a shot at being able to legimately calling something *significant*.\n\npersonally, I think it's some kind of distributed way to verify or or test candidate models, but with test time compute turned way down.  to increase the sensitivity they would need to make the conditions of the test (thinking amount, etc) as difficult as possible.  we'll never get verification of what the real cause is though.",

In brief:\n\n* Use affirmatives rather than negatives when telling Claude what to do\n* Only share what's _absolutely necessary_\n* One context = one task. Do not mix tasks. When one task is finished, clear context and continue\n* Aggressively compact - if your context hits 50% without the task being well underway or finished, you're doing something wrong\n* Use both a global CLAUDE.md and a project-level CLAUDE.md. Make them both *as brief as you possibly can*\n\nIn general, *every* token in your context is going to affect Claude, including tokens piped in from your CLAUDE.md files. The more tokens you have in your context that have nothing to do with what you're working on, the dumber your Claude is going to get and the more stuff it's going to forget and/or ignore. Therefore, the *better* you are at managing your context, the *smarter* your Claude is going to be. It really does make a HUGE difference.\n\nClaude Code is great but it's ultimately still a tool, which means it can be used right and it can be used wrong. I wish people would stop automatically assuming it's the hammer that's broken when so many are holding it by its wrong end and trying to punch in a nail with the handle.",

I know can do these things, but given that it is up to claude deciding to follow your rules, and things like sub-agent types being something you just want to work. Some of this more fundamental orchestration machinery feels like it should be external and programatic. What I mean is that when claude goes to route something he uses some kind of skill and that runs an external programatic process which makes the orchestration much more predictable. If you've ever tried to have claude work on 362 tasks to complete a feature you know it can sometimes be difficult to guarantee that he finishes across multiple sessions.  \n\nWe tend to give everything to Claude first, but I think we should also be assessing what we can pull back from him and give to traditional programatic code. Ideally you'd replace everything until 80%+ is programatic code.  Like a process of claude assimilating and building his own appendages.",

You could hash normalized error messages, store the fix notes next to tasks.json, and pop a toast when it matches.",

The important thing about this topic is how we define an error that we intend to keep in context. claude code shouldnt keep every error we and it faced. As i see it fixes majority of them in single shot. So how we gonna define it? \nBut i definitely understand your problem here because i faced that a lot too. i see llms like some kind of super focused dog. When i faced an error that claude code fails to fix and dive into error loop, i simply ask this: thing something else, when you say something like fix this, do this etc. it always trying to fix the problem without using or thinking something else. One time i fixed this kind of error loop simply saying this: find the piece of code produces error, identify what it does, and search something else does the same thing. And Valaaaa! in single shot it is fixed. \nWhat i mean is sometimes the problem is not the error, it was that piece of code we use in the begining. So the solution is not fixing the error which llm tries to do repetitively. These kind of stuff complicates defining error in my mind. \nMay be we can manage this process manually or find a way to automate it. i am open to any ideas here",

Most engineers skip right past them, but they completely changed my workflow.\n\nWrote a deep dive covering everything I wish I knew when I started.\n\n**What hooks let you do:**\n- Run your own code at any point in Claude Code's workflow\n- 13 different events to hook into (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Notification, Stop, etc.)\n- Block, allow, or modify actions before they happen\n- Add context, send notifications, enforce workflows\n\n**What I cover in the post:**\n- All 13 hook events explained with examples\n- The data flow (JSON stdin → your logic → JSON stdout)\n- Exit codes and what they mean\n- Python vs Node.js for hooks (spoiler: Node for high-frequency events)\n- Ready-to-use safety hooks\n\n**The hooks I use daily:**\n1. Block dangerous commands (rm -rf ~/, force push main, fork bombs)\n2. Protect secrets (.env, SSH keys, AWS creds)\n3. Slack notifications when Claude needs input\n\n**Blog post:** https://karanbansal.in/blog/claude-code-hooks\n\n**GitHub repo:** https://github.com/karanb192/claude-code-hooks\n\nThis is part 1 - more coming on prompt-based hooks, context injection, and session memory.\n\nWhat hooks are you all building?",

              "text": "My understanding is simple:\n\n1. Hook: When you need it before, after, or while Claude is doing something, it runs a script externally. It has nothing to do with AI, like planning a trip where you need to refuel at point A and find a supermarket to eat at point B.\n2. Subagents: Imagine you have multiple Claude Code instances. Each one does a different task, and each instance has a different context. It only focuses on its task, meaning it's not affected by the context of other instances, so it only executes the instruction passed to it, which in this case is the Main Agent. Practical use cases: searching for relevant files to synthesize the problem, or an agent reading files like PROGRESS.md or ROADMAP.md to track your progress and return the information to the Main Agent. This way, the Main Agent doesn't waste many steps, as each tool call consumes unnecessary tokens.\n3. Skills: It's not like a Subagent, nor is it like a markdown document that you reference:\n   * It simply branches the context (if you allow it in the frontmatter), inserts the skill content, uses it at the right time, returns the result, and the AI ​​forgets that skill content, preventing token inflation.\n   * Or, if it doesn't branch, Skills are still different because they support running scripts. Like an upgrade to Hooks, but triggered by AI.\n4. Plugins & Marketplace: This is just a place to gather all of the above during installation. The Marketplace is used to install plugins containing hooks, subagents, skills, etc., and for auto-updates.\n\nHopefully, this will be helpful to those who need it. Please help me correct anything I haven't understood correctly. 🤗",

      "text": "I made a video breaking down Ralph from first principles. Geoffrey Huntley (the creator of the loop) reached out and designated it as the official explainer.\n\nIn short: Ralph Wiggum is an autonomous coding loop that lets your Claude work through an implementation plan in your codebase while you sleep.\n\nHere are the key takeaways:\n\n**Skip the plugin** \\- Do not use Anthropic's Ralph plugin, it degrades performance by keeping each loop in the same context window.\n\n**Exploration mode** \\- My favorite way to use Ralph. When I have remaining tokens in my max plan, I brain dump and converse for \\~10 minutes with Claude and set up Ralph the night before usage resets. Lets him test, explore, and/or build an idea I've had to put on the backburner.\n\n**True simplicity** \\- Ralph is literally just a bash while loop that calls Claude in headless mode until a stopping criteria is met. This simplicity gives us power users a broad ability to tailor autonomous loops to our own systems and ideas.\n\n**Fresh context** \\- Instead of letting context accumulate and degrade, Ralph treats each iteration as a fresh context window. The spec and implementation plan become the source of truth, not previous conversation history. This sidesteps context rot entirely.\n\n**Spec sizing** \\- Your specs and implementation plan need to leave enough room for implementation within each loop. If your spec is too bloated, you risk hitting the \"dumb zone\" during every single iteration.\n\n**Bidirectional planning** \\- Have you and Claude both ask each other questions until your specs and implementation plan are fully aligned. This surfaces implicit assumptions, which are typically the source of most bugs.\n\n**You own the spec** \\- Since we are treating the specs as the source of truth, it is our job to read every line and edit it ourselves. Without bulletproof specs that make sense to us, Ralph will go off the rails.\n\nFull video link (for the full rundown on how Ralph actually works): [https://youtu.be/I7azCAgoUHc](https://youtu.be/I7azCAgoUHc)",

This is because you can think of LLMs as having a finite amount of attention which is basically how much weight they can put into what previous tokens in the conversation at each step of generating the next token. This finite attention gets stretched thin when there are too many tokens in context (since attention weights must sum to 1 across all tokens in context). Not only this, but tokens in the middle of the conversation start to get ignored, in a phenomenon called 'lost in the middle'. Also any irrelevant or contradictory tokens (commonly found in [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) files) cause attention to be given to the wrong places. All of this results in increased hallucination rate, decreased instruction following quality, and a 'dumber' model over all. Hope this helps",

      "text": "I want to start the post off with a disclaimer: \n\n>all the content within this post is merely me sharing what setup is working best for me currently and should not be taken as gospel or only correct way to do things. It's meant to hopefully inspire you to improve your setup and workflows with AI agentic coding. I'm just another average dev and this is just like, my opinion, man.\n\nLet's get into it.\n\nWell I wanted to share how I actually use Claude Code for legacy refactoring because I see a lot of people getting burned.\n\nThey point Claude at a messy codebase, type '*refactor this to be cleaner*', and watch it generate beautiful, modular code that doesn't work and then they spend next 2 days untangling what went wrong.\n\nI just finished refactoring 50k lines of legacy code across a `Django` monolith that hadn't been meaningfully touched in 4 years. \n\nIt took me 3 weeks without Claude Code, I'd estimate 2-3 months min but here's the thing: the speed didn't come from letting Claude run wild It came from a specific workflow that kept the refactoring on rails.\n\n**Core Problem With Legacy Refactoring**\n\nLegacy code is different from greenfield. There's no spec. All tests are sparse or nonexistent. Half the 'design decisions' were made by old dev who left the company in 2020 and code is in prod which means if you break something, real users feel it.\n\nClaude Code is incredibly powerful but it has no idea what your code is *supposed* to do. \n\nIt can only see what it *does* do right now but for refactoring, it's dangerous.\n\n**counterintuitive move**: before Claude writes a single line of refactored code, you need to lock down what the existing behavior actually is. Tests become your safety net, not an afterthought.\n\n**Step 1: Characterization Tests First**\n\nI don't start by asking Claude to refactor anything. \n\nI start by asking it to write tests that capture current codebase behavior.\n\n>**My prompt:** \"Generate minimal pytest characterization tests for \\[module\\]. Focus on capturing current outputs given realistic inputs. No behavior changes, just document what this code actually does right now.\"\n\nThis feels slow. You're not 'making progress' yet but these tests are what let you refactor fearlessly later. \n\nEvery time Claude makes a change, you run tests. If they pass, refactor preserved behavior. If they fail, you caught a regression before it hit prod.\n\nRepeated behaviour >>> Efficiency.\n\nI spent the first 4 days just generating characterization tests. \n\nBy end, I had coverage on core parts of codebase, stuff I was most scared to touch.\n\n  \n**Step 2: Set Up Your CLAUDE .md File**\n\n**<Don’t skip this one>**\n\nCLAUDE .md is a file that gets loaded into Claude's context automatically at the start of every conversation. \n\nThink of it as persistent memory for your project and for legacy refactoring specifically, this file is critical because Claude needs to understand not just how to write code but what it shouldn't touch.\n\n>You can run /init to auto-generate a starter file, it'll analyze your codebase structure, package files, and config. But treat that as a starting point. For refactoring work, you need to add a lot more.\n\nHere's a structure I use:\n\n    ## Build Commands\n    - python manage.py test apps.billing.tests: Run billing tests\n    - python manage.py test --parallel: Run full test suite\n    - flake8 apps/: Run linter\n    \n    ## Architecture Overview\n    Django monolith, ~50k LOC. Core modules: billing, auth, inventory, notifications.\n    Billing and auth are tightly coupled (legacy decision). Inventory is relatively isolated.\n    Database: PostgreSQL. Cache: Redis. Task queue: Celery.\n    \n    ## Refactoring Guidelines\n    - IMPORTANT: Always run relevant tests after any code changes\n    - Prefer incremental changes over large rewrites\n    - When extracting methods, preserve original function signatures as wrappers initially\n    - Document any behavior changes in commit messages\n    \n    ## Hard Rules\n    - DO NOT modify files in apps/auth/core without explicit approval\n    - DO NOT change any database migration files\n    - DO NOT modify the BaseModel class in apps/common/models.py\n    - Always run tests before reporting a task as complete\n\n  \nThat 'Hard Rules' section is non-negotiable for legacy work. \n\nEvery codebase has load-bearing walls, code that looks ugly but is handling some critical edge case nobody fully understands anymore. \n\nI explicitly tell Claude which modules are off-limits unless I specifically ask.\n\nOne thing I learned the hard way: CLAUDE .md files cascade hierarchically. \n\nIf you have `root/CLAUDE.md` and `apps/billing/CLAUDE.md`, both get loaded when Claude touches billing code. I use this to add module-specific context. The billing CLAUDE. md has details about proration edge cases that don't matter elsewhere.\n\n**Step 3: Incremental Refactoring With Continuous Verification**\n\nHere's where the actual refactoring happens but the keyword is *incremental*.\n\nI break refactoring into small, specific tasks. \n\n>'Extract the discount calculation logic from Invoice.process() into a separate method.' \"Rename all instances of 'usr' to 'user' in the auth module.\" \"Remove the deprecated payment\\_v1 endpoint and all code paths that reference it.\"\n\nEach task gets its own prompt. After each change, Claude runs the characterization tests. If they pass, we commit and move on. If they fail, we debug before touching anything else.\n\n>The prompt I use: \"Implement this refactoring step: \\[specific task\\]. After making changes, run pytest tests/\\[relevant\\_test\\_file\\].py and confirm all tests pass. If any fail, debug and fix before reporting completion.\"\n\nThis feels tedious but it's way faster than letting Claude do a big-bang refactor and spending two days figuring out which of 47 changes broke something.\n\n  \n**Step 4: CodeRabbit Catches What I Miss**\n\nEven with tests passing, there's stuff you miss. \n\n* Security issues. \n* Performance antipatterns. \n* Subtle logic errors that don't show up in your test cases.\n\nI run CodeRabbit on every PR before merging. \n\n>It's an AI code review tool that runs 40+ analyzers and catches things that generic linters miss… race conditions, memory leaks, places where Claude hallucinated an API that doesn't exist.\n\nThe workflow: Claude finishes a refactoring chunk, I commit and push, CodeRabbit reviews, I fix whatever it flags, push again and repeat until the review comes back clean.\n\nOn one PR, CodeRabbit caught that Claude had introduced a SQL injection vulnerability while 'cleaning up' a db query.\n\n  \n**Where This Breaks Down**\n\nI'm not going to pretend this is foolproof.\n\nContext limits are real. \n\n* Claude Code has a 200k token limit but performance degrades well before that. I try to stay under 25-30k tokens per session. \n* For big refactors, I use handoff documents… markdown files that summarize progress, decisions made and next steps so I can start fresh sessions without losing context.\n* Hallucinated APIs still happen. Claude will sometimes use methods that don't exist, either from external libraries or your own codebase. The characterization tests catch most of this but not all.\n* Complex architectural decisions are still on you. \n* Claude can execute a refactoring plan beautifully. It can't tell you whether that plan makes sense for where your codebase is headed. That judgment is still human work.\n\n**My verdict**\n\nRefactoring 50k lines in 3 weeks instead of 3 months is possible but only if you treat Claude Code as a powerful tool that needs guardrails not an autonomous refactoring agent.\n\n* Write characterization tests before you touch anything\n* Set up your CLAUDE .md with explicit boundaries and hard rules\n* Refactor incrementally with continuous test verification\n* Use CodeRabbit or similar ai code review tools to catch what tests miss\n* And review every change yourself before it goes to prod.\n\nAnd that's about all I can think of for now. \n\nLike I said, I'm just another dev and I would love to hear tips and tricks from everybody else, as well as any criticisms because I'm always up for improving upon my workflow. \n\nIf you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read.",

It will bring bugs, and you prompting to solve bugs with bring more bugs.\n\nEven if you try to refactor things step by step, the context starts fading after 4-5 prompts. I've tried it, doesnt work trust me.\n\nMy approach was using **spec driven development** approach to deal with it. I used [Traycer](https://traycer.ai/)'s epic mode to generate specs for my existing code. They had a dedicated code refactoring workflow, which is supposed to deal with things like this.\n\nI get my specs made, it broke the task into tickets. each ticket was a small task. I manually checked them. If the task was easy, I mean if i felt it could be done by claude, I directly handed it off. Otherwise, I broke it down further into phases, then each phase was a sub-task, make it even more simpler.\n\n*Note: While I'm doing all this, I don't need to worry about the context window because the claude will be referring these specs at every chat. So it actually made progress with every task, and not break things of step 1 when I reach step 4.*\n\nYou'd need to overlook this process all the time. Don't let even a single line of slop enter your code, or you'd spend hours (or even days) finding what went wrong.\n\nAs you've mentioned, [CodeRabbit](https://www.coderabbit.ai/) will help you out with reviewing and cutting out the incorrect code.

Because while humans can do it better now, including context, nuance, debugging, and all the rest, those will eventually fall. writing code was just the beginning. AI really is getting better and will eventually subsume everything else. (and remember, today it is simply the worst it will ever be.) I say this more as a basis for reality that, much as we want to resist it, what we need to do now is find any/creative means somehow to embrace or simply to survive it going forward, or use our backgrounds for something better adapted to the onrushing changes.",

Just now, instead of writing and debugging code, we’re going to be solving problems at a higher abstraction layer.\n\nThinking back to some of the work I did earlier in my career, building out MVPs for early stage startups and companies, we might have 4-6 engineers on a project for 6-8 months.

I was legit considering entirely different industries and making a career shift to something less exposed to AI but would still let me make a living to provide comfortably for my family.\n\nIt’s not the first time I’ve felt something like this, but it certainly is the biggest magnitude I’ve felt it.\n\nI then realized that this, like other times before, is a skill and experience with a new tool issue. We’re just now watching the wave swell and it’s time to paddle and get up to speed to ride this thing. You still have time, but now is the time for action and learning. I’ve heard people saying “it won’t be AI that takes your job, it will be the engineer who knows how to use AI that takes your job” and I have a gut feeling that it’s true, at least on some level. So I plan on being the engineer that knows the AI tools and I’m doing everything I can to keep up to date and paddle for all I’m worth.\n\nI think the bigger issue we’re seeing in the near term is different though. 5 years is a small eternity in tech, especially when looking at where we were 5 years ago with AI. Agents weren’t even a “thing” yet. In the near term (like, next 12-18 months), I think the issue is companies figuring out both how many folks are actually needed to accomplish the work using AI and if they need to hire, how to do it properly in this new world. Any programming challenge any company can give you to solve in an hour or two, something like Claude Code can crush in about 10-30 minutes, tops. I’ve noticed a _ton_ of elitism when it comes to interviewing. Coworkers and acquaintances talking about catching people using AI or suspected of using AI. Trying to rig up systems that watch for “unusual inputs” or watching people’s eyes closely to see if they are trying to read and copy something from another screen.\n\nI think these hiring managers and the engineers “testing” candidates have lost the plot. We’re telling candidates “you can’t use AI” but then the moment you’re on the team, you’re expected to find a way to integrate AI into your workflow to make yourself better. We’re testing for the wrong things. I don’t have a perfect answer yet, but I know it doesn’t involve banning AI agents. I think it will involve something like “Tell us your preferred agent and show us how you use it. Show us your custom setup or projects you’ve worked on with it, if you can.” People have long said things like “it’s not about the code, it’s about how they work through problems and what it’s like working with the person”. Well, it’s time for the rubber to meet the road and actually do what they claim.\n\nAnywho, that’s all to say, take a breath, recenter yourself, and dive in.

If it doesnt satisfy needs of all that means there is still room for human work and you can do that\n\n\nImho, most likely is 2nd one in with temporary turmoil. Many losers many winners.

      "text": "I've been using Claude Code daily since it launched in February 2025. Obsessively.\n\nAt this point I've spent hundreds of hours building, deleting, rebuilding, and being frustrated that it kept making the same mistakes.\n\nHere's a trimed version of a blog post I wrote earlier. I tried to trim as much as possible, but it's a lot of info 😅.\n\nHope it helps.\n\n\\-\n\n# 1.  Claude .md is non-negotiable \n\n[CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) is a file that Claude reads automatically every session. Without it, every session starts from zero. You re-explain your context, your preferences, your constraints. Every. Single. Time. \n\nI resisted this for weeks. Felt like unnecessary overhead. That stubbornness cost me dozens of hours.\n\n**The fastest way to create one: let Claude interview you.** \n\nNavigate to your project folder and say:\n\n*\"I need to create a* [*CLAUDE.md*](http://CLAUDE.md) *file for this project. Interview me to understand what this project is about, how I want things done, and what mistakes to avoid. Then create the file.\"* \n\nThe interview surfaces constraints and preferences you'd forget to document yourself. Claude asks questions you wouldn't think to answer.          \n\n\\-                                                          \n\n# 2. Context is THE most important thing\n\nClaude Code has a memory limit. When conversations get long, it \"compacts\" context - basically summarizing older stuff to make room. \n\nIf you've compacted, chances are you're too far gone and your results are going to start degrading.\n\nThe warning signs:\n\n\\- Suggesting ideas you already rejected\n\n\\- Forgetting constraints from earlier\n\n\\- Quality suddenly dropping\n\n\\- Going in circles\n\n\\- Repeating questions you already answered\n\n**The fix: When this happens, don't fight it. Type /clear and start fresh.**\n\nA clean context with clear instructions beats a degraded conversation every time.\n\nI know it feels wrong - you've invested time. But starting over is going to save you a lot of time and energy. A fresh start takes 5 minutes. Fighting a confused session can burn hours.                        \n\nThis is also why constantly pushing commits to GitHub is so important\n\n**My rule: if Claude Code can't fix it in 5 attempts or less, I /clear and try again.**  \n\n\\-\n\n# 3. Plan Mode first\n\nI used to just dive in with \"build \\_\\_\\_\".\n\nMore often than I'd like to admit, I'd come back 20 minutes later to find Claude had:            \n\n\\- Restructured my entire project in ways I never asked for \n\n\\- Deleted files I needed \n\n\\- Built something technically impressive that completely missed the point                                \n\n**Plan Mode tells Claude to think through the approach BEFORE doing any work.**                \n\nPress **Shift+Tab twice** to toggle it, or just say: \n\n*\"Before you do anything, create a detailed plan for \\[this task\\]. Show me the plan and wait for my approval before executing.\"*\n\nA good plan includes:\n\n\\- What Claude thinks you want\n\n\\- Steps to accomplish it   \n\n\\- Files it will create or modify \n\n\\- How it will verify success \n\n\\- What could go wrong\n\nReview it. Ask questions. Request changes. Only approve when confident\n\n**Plans also survive context compaction better than scattered conversation. When Claude summarizes old context, a clear structured plan is more likely to be preserved.**\n\n**-**\n\n# 4. The Plan-Then-Execute workflow\n\nThis is my most-used pattern now.                                                                                                  \n\n**Chat 1:** Create the plan. Back and forth. Get messy. Refine until it's right. Save the final approved plan.\n\n**Chat 2:** Start fresh. Paste the plan. Say \"Execute this step by step. After each major step, verify it's working before moving on.\"\n\n\\* Claude will auto-clear the context for you now.     \n\nWhy separate sessions? \n\n**Context.** The planning session gets cluttered with back-and-forth, rejected ideas, and exploration. Starting fresh for execution means clean context. The plan carries forward the important decisions. Claude has maximum context budget for actual work.  \n\nThink of it like cooking: Session 1 is writing the recipe. Session 2 is cooking the meal. You don't want to figure out the recipe while the stove is on. \n\n\\-\n\n# 5. Your prompts matter more than you think \n\n\"If I had 5 hours to vibe code, I would spend 4 hours of it polishing the prompt\"\n\n\\- Abraham Lincoln, probably\n\nI used to blame Claude for mediocre outputs. Then I looked back at my prompts and realized I barely understood what I wanted myself.\n\nVague prompts produce vague results. Specific prompts produce specific results.\n\n**A good prompt has four things:**   \n\n1. What files to look at\n2. What to find or create  \n3. What details to include \n4. What format to output                                                                                                                   \n\n**Bad:**\n\n\"Analyze this data\"\n\n**Good:**\n\n\"Analyze the customer feedback in /data. Find the top 5 complaints by frequency. For each, include: the exact quote that best represents it, how many times it appeared, which customer segment mentioned it most. Output as markdown table.\" \n\n**Give Claude a way to verify its work:**\n\n*\"Build me a report, then check that all the numbers in the summary match the totals in the raw data. If anything doesn't match, fix it before showing me.\"* \n\nWhen Claude can check its own work, errors get caught before reaching you.                         \n\n**Tell Claude what NOT to do:**\n\n\\- \"Don't create new folders. Work within the existing structure\"\n\n\\- \"Don't modify any files in /config\"\n\n\\- \"Don't round numbers. I need exact figures\"\n\nSometimes the most useful instruction is what to avoid.\n\n\\-\n\n# 6. Keep files small (~1000 lines max)\n\nI had a project with one 5,000+ line file. Claude would make changes to one part and accidentally break something in a completely different section. Took me hours of debugging to figure out what was going wrong.\n\nWhen Claude works with files, it loads them into context. Massive files eat up context budget and make it harder to work effectively.\n\nSmaller files = faster processing, targeted changes without side effects, and less risk of Claude touching stuff it didn't need to touch.\n\n**If you're building something new:**\n\n\"*Split this into separate files. Each file should handle one responsibility and be under 1000 lines.\"*\n\n**If working with existing large files:**  \n\n  *\"This file is too large. Suggest how to break it into smaller, focused modules.\"* \n\nDon't refactor everything at once. When you touch a file, check if it should be split. Improve incrementally.\n\n\\-\n\n# 7. The Task System (now built-in)\n\nThis used to be a workaround I recommended. Now it's official. \n\nClaude Code just shipped a proper task management system with dependency tracking (v2.1.16). The old \"todos\" got a serious upgrade.\n\nAsk Claude to create a task list:\n\n*\"Before you start, create a task list for this project. Mark which tasks depend on others. Include self-review checkpoints after each major phase. Then work through the list systematically.\"* \n\n**Why the new system matters:**\n\n\\- Tasks track dependencies (Task B automatically waits for Task A)\n\n\\- They survive context compaction better than conversation\n\n\\- Claude can parallelize independent tasks \n\n\\- If something fails, it knows exactly where to resume \n\n\\- Resource isolation means tasks don't interfere with each other \n\nThis was always the right technique. Now it's the right technique with native support.\n\nFor any task that takes more than a few minutes, this is essential.\n\n\\-\n\n# 8. Skills: Stop re-explaining your preferences \n\nYou know that thing where you explain your preferences to Claude for the fifteenth time and think \"why can't it just *remember* this?\" \n\nSkills fix that.\n\nSkills are reusable instruction sets Claude applies automatically. Your brand voice. Your report format. Your quality checklist. Teach Claude once, never re-explain again.\n\n**Without Skills:** You re-explain preferences every session.\n\n**With Skills:** Claude automatically applies your brand voice. Reports come out in your format. Error checks happen without asking. \n\nThe difference is consistency and convenience. My outputs actually feel like *mine*, not like generic AI slop.\n\n**How to create one:** \n\n1. Open a new claude code chat  \n2. Say: \"Help me build a skill for \\[your use case\\]\"      \n3. Describe what you want Claude to remember \n4. Claude generates a Skill file           \n5. Use it with /skill-name or tell Claude to use it in chat\n\n**Some Skill ideas:**     \n\n\\- Brand voice (how you sound, words to use/avoid)\n\n\\- Report formatting (standard structure, required sections)\n\n\\- Code review checklist (what to check, common mistakes)\n\n\\- Analysis framework (mental models, standard questions) \n\n\\-\n\n# 9. Sub-agents for parallel work\n\nThis is where it gets powerful.\n\nI was doing competitive analysis - 5 competitors, customer feedback analysis, synthesize into a report. Normally a full day or two\n\nTold Claude: spin up sub-agents to research each competitor in parallel while the main agent processed feedback. Combine everything at the end.\n\n45 minutes. A report that would've taken me days.\n\n**How to use them:**\n\n*\"Create a sub-agent to analyze our top 3 competitors while you process customer feedback. Then combine the insights into a single report.\"* \n\nor\n\n*\"Spin up parallel agents to process each of these 5 data files, then merge the results.\"*\n\nThe new task system makes this even better. You can now say: \n\n*\"Research competitors A, B, C in parallel. The synthesis task depends on all three completing.\"*\n\nClaude handles the orchestration. Less like one employee. More like a project manager with a team. \n\n\\-\n\n# 10. Know when to start over\n\nSometimes the fastest path forward is a clean restart. \n\nI used to stubbornly stick with sessions way too long, thinking \"I've already put so much time into this conversation.\" Classic sunk-cost thinking.\n\nThat mentality cost me more time than starting fresh ever would have.  \n\n**Start fresh when:**  \n\n\\- Output quality has noticeably dropped  \n\n\\- Claude is repeating itself or going in circles                   \n\n\\- You've changed direction significantly\n\n\\- The conversation has become cluttered with false starts\n\nNow my rule is simple: if I notice quality dropping, I stop. Save the output. Start fresh. No guilt.\n\n\\---\n\n**Common mistakes (so you don't repeat mine)**\n\n**\"Claude keeps forgetting what I told it\"**\n\nYour context is probably compacted. Start fresh. Make sure important info is in [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md), not just conversation.\n\n**\"Output quality is inconsistent\"**   \n\nCreate Skills for recurring needs. More context about your preferences = more consistent results. Also check if your files are getting too large.\n\n**\"Claude made changes I didn't want\"**  \n\nUse Plan Mode. Review the plan before approving. Set up hooks to create automatic backups. \n\n**\"Long tasks produce worse results than short ones\"**\n\nUse the task system. Break work into checkpoints. Split across multiple sessions if needed.\n\n\\---\n\nCandidly this is the condensed version. I wrote up [ https://masteringai.io/guides/ultimate-claude-code-guide-for-beginners ](https://masteringai.io/guides/ultimate-claude-code-guide-for-beginners) if you want to go deeper. It's free. I just want people to stop making the same mistakes I did.\n\n**Claude Code (and AI) has been an incredible tool for me, and for the first time in my life I've been able to bring every idea to life.**\n\nNo need to raise $8m funding like I did for my startup.\n\nMy obsession has gotten so bad I'm banned from talking about Claude Code with my friends, so here I am 😅.\n\nHope this helped.\n\nWhat's working (or not working) for everyone else? Curious what patterns others have found.",
