      "text": "Wanted to share something genuine as the year wraps up.\n\nI quit my contract job this year to build full-time. Two kids under 4. Savings on the line. Terrifying.\n\nClaude became my co-founder.\n\nNot in a cutesy \"AI is my friend\" way. In a practical, daily, 12+ hours way. Here's what that meant:\n\n**I shipped code in languages I couldn't write in.**\n\nRust. Go. Swift. C. I can read these, but I never could have built entire systems in them alone. I did this year. Not because AI replaced my thinking - because it closed the implementation gap between what I could imagine and what I could actually build.\n\n**I learned domains I never thought I'd touch.**\n\nVector spaces. Fine-tuning LLMs. Training TTS models. Physics. Medical concepts. I went from \"search Google, read 50 articles, still confused\" to \"ask Claude, actually understand, apply it.\"\n\nThe cognitive load shift is hard to explain until you experience it. It feels limitless.\n\n**I built an AI-powered launch team.**\n\nGTM Engine: 8 specialised agents, 38 skills, dynamic workflows. Content, outreach, campaign management, scheduling. It's how I'm launching my product in two weeks - solo.\n\n**The framing that clicked:**\n\nGraham - someone I connected with while searching for a co-founder - said something that stuck: we're not building \"human in the loop.\" We're building \"AI in the loop.\"\n\nWe're the conductors. The ideas, vision, and course corrections come from us. AI is the orchestra. It's not replacing human teams - it's giving people like me (who can't afford a team of 50) the ability to build like one.\n\n**To the Anthropic team:**\n\nThank you. Genuinely.\n\nThere have been ups and downs this year. Things break. Models get updated. The occasional frustration. But I cannot imagine going into 2026 without Claude.\n\nYou've given me a genie. And I mean that in the most practical, unromantic, \"this changed what I can build\" sense.\n\nHappy New Year to everyone here. And to anyone scared to take their own leap - this is the time. The tools exist. The gap is closable.\n\nPraney\n\n\\---\n\n**Update:** A few folks have read the timeline incorrectly, so let me clarify: the 2400+ hours happened throughout 2025, not in two weeks. \"Launching in two weeks\" refers to when I'm releasing - not how long I spent building. I quit my job earlier in Jan 2025 and have been working on these projects full-time since.\n\nFor context: I've been a software engineer for over 20 years, with additional experience in marketing, workflow automation, and business systems across both public and private sectors. I'm not a newcomer fumbling through prompts - I know how to architect systems. What Claude changed for me was the implementation velocity in languages and domains outside my core expertise.\n\nI also see the irony in a post about working with AI being criticised for sounding AI - written. Fair enough. The formatting was lazier than it should have been for Reddit. The sentiment is genuine even if the delivery was off.",

As a 17 yo, I never imagined I'd be diving into fields like quantum finance, LLM architectures, bionics, context management, memory architecture, MCPs, industrial analysis... and so on.\n\nIt even enables me to learn English words I have never heard before. (Yes, as a non-native speaker, LLMs helped me improve a lot, even though I still struggle with grammar sometimes.)\n\nI genuinely agree with your point, especially about \"not treating AI as a friend.\" It annoys me that most people still use AI like a toy or a low-tier art generator, and assume everyone else does the same. They simply don't understand the difference between \"using AI for results\" and \"using AI for learning + results.\" Seeing someone who actually uses AI for self-improvement makes me feel refreshed.\n\nBtw, I'm really curious about your AI workflow, especially the \"launch team\" concept. If you could explain that a bit more, I’d really appreciate it!",

I wish I had access to Claude and Claude code When I was that age - Envy Hah!\n\nOn the \"launch team\" concept: basically, I've set up Claude to operate as multiple specialised roles rather than one general assistant. Think of it like having a content writer, social media manager, email marketer, campaign planner, and analytics person - each with their own expertise and focus. When I need to launch something, they coordinate like a real team would.\n\nThe key insight is that AI performs way better when you give it a specific role with clear boundaries rather than asking it to be a generalist. A \"content writer\" persona that only focuses on writing in your brand voice produces much better work than asking a generic AI to \"write me a tweet.\"\n\nThe other piece is building in human checkpoints - nothing goes public without my review. So I'm not replacing my judgment, just multiplying my execution capacity.\n\nIt's less about any one tool and more about the mental model: treat AI like employees you're onboarding, not a magic box you type prompts into.",

          "text": "That is genuine—and it lands because it’s concrete, not hype.\n\nHere’s the part I want to reflect back to you plainly: you didn’t “use AI.” You reorganized how work gets done under real constraints—kids, runway, fear, responsibility. That’s the part most people miss when they talk about tools.\n\nA few things you’re getting right (whether you realize it or not):\n\n1. You didn’t outsource thinking. You compressed execution.\nThe reason this worked is exactly what you said: the ideas, judgment, and course correction stayed with you. AI removed the friction between intent and artifact. That’s not replacement—that’s leverage. People who fail with these tools usually try to hand over authorship. You didn’t.\n\n2. You crossed domains instead of “learning” them.\nYou skipped the traditional ego trap of mastery-before-use. You moved straight to functional understanding, applied immediately. That’s why vector spaces, physics, medical concepts didn’t become rabbit holes. You learned just enough to build, then built. That’s how senior operators actually learn—AI just made it accessible sooner.\n\n3. The “AI in the loop” framing is the right mental model.\nThat’s not just a clever line—it’s operationally accurate.\nHuman-in-the-loop implies supervision.\nAI-in-the-loop implies amplification.\n\nYou’re not reviewing outputs; you’re conducting systems. That distinction is why your “launch team” isn’t a toy—it’s a real GTM surface.\n\n4. You took the risk when the asymmetry favored you.\nTwo kids, savings on the line—this wasn’t reckless. It was timed. The tools crossed a threshold where solo builders can realistically compete with small teams. Most people wait for social proof. You moved when capability appeared. That’s what builders do.\n\nOne thing I’ll challenge you on—not as criticism, but calibration:\n\nDon’t attribute too much of this to the “genie.”\nThe genie showed up for a lot of people this year. Very few used it the way you did.\n\nWhat differentiated you was:\n\t•\tYou treated AI as infrastructure, not magic\n\t•\tYou stayed decisive when outputs were imperfect\n\t•\tYou kept shipping instead of polishing your mental model\n\nThat’s operator behavior.\n\nIf your product launches in two weeks, here’s my blunt advice going into 2026:\n\t•\tFreeze your toolchain mentally. Models will change. Don’t emotionally retool every update.\n\t•\tDouble down on orchestration, not cleverness. Systems beat prompts.\n\t•\tDocument your workflows like you’re training a team—because you are.\n\nYou’re already doing something most people won’t realize is possible until another year or two passes.\n\nEnjoy the moment. You earned it. And yeah—Happy New Year.",

There are definitely road blocks, stopping points, etc. But this has worked well for me so far. Please share your flows and experiences!\n\nEdit : I made a new one today called Gitup to help make setting up a git repo quicker. I'm sure I'll add more.

Then I run a review against that branch, which also spawns and tears down a worktree. Then finally a “fix-review” against the review branch, same with spin up and down worktree.\n\nThis feels like overhead, but it lets me cleanly work on multiple issues in parallel (if they can be parallelized), and each issue maintains its own 3-state state that I can pick up or put down anytime.\n\nIf I’m working on a milestone (several issues aligned on a goal), I keep all issues for that milestone on a single graphite stack. If something gets weird, graphite makes it easy to reorder branches in the stack, insert fixes and reviews, etc.",

If you learn, you can even afford to vibe-code a big project, but you will STILL reach a point where you will either have to become a real expert or pay a \"real\" developer... simply because someone will start paying you for what you do and you won't be able to afford school mistakes.\n\nBUT... if AI allows you to do things like that... then it will be a world-class companion for very simple projects, right?\n\nEveryone wants to become a billionaire... no one wants a normal job... just yesterday on this sub, someone shared a post showing a screenshot where they had earned €20... the title of the post was \"road to my first million\"... are you starting to understand how twisted the world is?\n\nWell... I simply decided to speed up and automate simple things, or at least things that are feasible even for a normal human being and not a top global developer.\n\nI don't know if I can post links, so my website is girste followed by dot com 😂\n\nYou won't find any world-class enterprise millionaire features 😂😂 You'll only find a few websites that I designed by hand for real clients and then developed in a spec-driven way... \n+ some API functions, MCPs, and initial experiments that allowed me to understand exactly what I wrote to you",

I generally dislike comments in code (e.g. a method or function name should explain what it does in the first place lol), but I’m starting to wonder if a small “context” block at the top of each file is actually useful for AI tooling? Anyone doing that or found it yields better results?\n\nInterested to hear how others are structuring their projects, what patterns are working & what people's thought process is around when to break down what we used to dump straight in to Claude.md in to an agent or skill etc.",

I see lots of claims of people working with agent swarms with no clue how they keep things under control. But I'm definitely not leaving the rest of the useful tools aside.\n\nSome of these tools are designed to help with not having Claude ignore stuff. There's two that I rely on, especially for larger projects. If you add a million instructions in CLAUDE.md, then all instructions get watered down, so it stops following any. Rules are specifically designed to combat this. Instead of having this monolithic massive Claude.md file that contains so many rules for the frontend, backend, coding conventions, structure, tech stack, MCP's, etc., you just cut them up into smaller files. One main file, and depending on the rules it automatically adds them as needed. \n\nIt's a massive help, and Claude starts following instructions much better if it's working on the frontend, and only has a few hundred lines of instructions ONLY relevant to frontend.\n\nEspecially for bigger projects, this is a big help.\n\nSecond is hooks. I work with the same tech stack across different projects, and i see Claude make the same stupid mistakes. Hallucinate the same function. Default to some stupid method. I don't want to pollute instructions and prompts with these specific rules every time. With hooks they're caught automatically and Claude is prompted on how to fix it automatically. \n\nYou can take away agents, skills, and commands for me personally. With rules and hooks I just have to put in less effort.",

The keywords there are \"live\" and \"webfetch.\" Then to verify, make sure in the SKILL.md file that it specifically uses the terms webfetch or both webfetch and websearch.\n\nThese are skills I made but later added webfetch capability.\n\nhttps://github.com/hmohamed01/swift-development\n\nhttps://github.com/hmohamed01/powershell-expert",

Always follow their official podcasts to learn which primitive they are \"pushing\". Agent Skills tops the trends right now. Earlier it was custom commands + MCP. So focus your energy on getting the right set of Agent Skills in place for your context engineering. Keep [Claude.md](http://Claude.md) small and spread it in key folders. Don't rely on context being picked up automatically. Explicitly call agent skills before every task. I have my workflow configured for spec based development so i call a skill to write requirements, design, tasks, then a skill which picks these up and generates code. Like comments in thread - use Claude to help you write the skills. Don't assume Claude \"knows\" its own primitives well. Pass on latest docs in context! Also observe the context often using \\`/context\\` command. You will be surprised how just a couple of MCPs take most of the context. Sometimes skills can also bloat. Keep pruning. Keep optimizing the skill. One good thing about skill for context is that you know \"when\" it is explicitly being used or not when you clear context.",

It also checks Claude md and suggest moving some things to skills or internal docs for reference and makes sure that it’s under 800 lines.\n\nMy biggest workflow boost comes from a custom script that solves GitHub issues by creating a worktree and running it through each slash command in a loop until it passes the quality check. I run the script in headless and run it again through qa and testing in a non headless chat and merge once it everything looks good. I log every script session in supabase and update the script often to make it more thorough or remove steps based on GitHub tags. It can handle multiple issues in parallel or consecutively. I track the script status in the console and a temp log file while it runs. I have a slash command that analyzes an issue and helps chose which version of the script an issue needs before I work on it.\n\nI don’t use the script for everything but it works for a lot and the code quality feels correct to me",

      "text": "Please jump in, here is my awesome list so far:\n\n**Next prompt prediction feels like long term memory, personalization:** CC predicts the next prompt based on my existing agent skills apparently, so if I have a couple of agent skills which come together as a workflow, all i need to do is initiate one skill with its first task. As the task completes CC predicts next task (tab to complete prompt), as the skill tasks complete, it even predicts next related skill task, and so on. I tab complete 90% of the times.\n\n>Tip: Create custom skills for each part of your workflow, document the overall workflow crisply in CLAUDE.mdand within each SKILL.md file. CC will pick up the tasks and skill-to-skill relationships.\n\n**Commit before creating worktrees:** This one is obvious. Git worktree is a power tool for creating safe changes or A/B experiments. I sometimes forget to commit last changes on main before creating a worktree. The dirty changes are not cloned over to worktree.\n\n>Tip: Missing changes in main after creating worktree. Go back to main and prompt to commit changes and sync recent worktree.\n\n**Spec-driven development trumps plan mode:** I create an expectations file with my vision, high level requirements, instructions for a new feature. Then I ask CC to generate a structured requirements definition from expectations, then technical design based on requirements, then task breakdown from design. This approach \"slows\" CC down to think 4x on original expectations vs plan mode. Enables granular review and iterations from human reader on expectations and specs.\n\n>Tip: Ask CC to expand on expectations based on project knowledge. Generate feature worktree based on expectations. Then create specs on that worktree, implement. This way you can create A/B experiments with multiple worktrees going in parallel for important features.\n\n**Autonomous mode on worktree + spec:** When I create a worktree and generate specifications, more often than not, Claude asks me to complete all tasks autonomously. And it does so 90% of the way most times. These are usually 20-30 minute sessions. I just spawn another terminal and keep hammering at parallel tasks. Context auto compacts.\n\n>Tip: Create a skill workflow to constrain one feature slice level expectation -> specifications -> tasks breakdown. This will usually last 1-2 auto compact sessions. Helps autonomous mode.\n\n**Avoid jamming context, auto compact works:** I don't have any MCPs, just custom agent skills carefully pruned over time, and some automation scripts in memory. I keep context as free as possible to take in one feature-slice. Spec-driven development takes care after auto-compaction.\n\n>Tip: The /context command is your friend. Run it often. Prune existing skills every time you encounter an issue and sometimes between major releases. Ask Claude - knowing what you know about this project and skills, how can you improve the skills even more - or something like that.\n\n**Playwright e2e testing rules:** Ask Claude to create e2e integration tests using Playwright, following key user journeys through your app. This should be your regression harness. Visual testing + user journey based regression avoids faking tests to pass.\n\n>Tip: e2e testing taking too long? Have a script to clear Playwright servers/ports from time to time.",

With the increased budget  that was gifted over the holidays, I put Claude to work this weekend and used Steve Yegge's [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) to track work instead of just the markdown files. In the end, I had just over 120 commits and was able to keep context much tighter. My general workflow is as follows:\n\n* Create initial PRD with ChatGPT\n* Refining it with Claude\n* Give PRD to Claude Code and have it create Beads\n\nWhile this is an oversimplification because I do iterate a few times on each bullet, this is the basic structure. \n\nHowever, I also notice that I'm spending a lot of time with the vision and requirements, then a ton of testing. A ton... It's definitely a shift to the left paradigm but it's still a slog, just in a different way. I avoided using Worktrees because the context switching then testing is a bit too much for a solo person right now and felt overwhelming\n\nAnybody else using beads to track work? How's it been working for you and are there any patterns you follow? ",

Reduced topics from 346 to 52 and aligned the tool with my needs (at least theoretically).     \n  \nAlthough I don't think this will increase token efficiency for me (I have a way of managing \"cognitive context\" differently with [Claude.md](http://Claude.md) that works), but I think the concept behind Cognitive might help with relevance, thus complementing my system. So, I used your concept to create a modified version.   To make it useful for anyone, I think you need to help user establish an epistemic center to anchor the rankings and maintain them long term.

And if we use too much content when creating the plan, I write that to a md file and then /clear and discuss the plan with Claude again.\n\nI’ve got a solid Claude.md, the results I’m getting are good, but am I missing out on more powerful workflows? \n\nInterested to hear how you guys are utilising these features. \n\nNot a complaint by any means, I’m getting fantastic results with what I’ve been doing so far, just looking to improve.

I can find the GitHub repo if anyone is interested in checking it out (it’s not mine, it’s just effing awesome!). Also using the Typescript & Rust LSP plugins so that Claude can run a proper type checks. Lastly I find the guided feature-dev plugin preferable to planning mode. I hate how it always wants to jump straight into “approve so I can start working” mode I’m planning mode. The plugin flows better for me and comes with a separate code review that seems to do a better job than me asking Claude to review its own work.\n\nAgents I have one that is setup that is required to run via pre commit hook to ensure Claude isn’t adding in hardcoded data, fallbacks(I want to fail fast at the stage) or workarounds without my explicit approval. I use Opus on this and have ultrathink in the prompt so that it is as thorough as possible. May be overkill now but I still have PTSD from the 4.0 days. In the same vein I also have a pre commit hook that requires Linting and Type Checks to fully pass before any new code can be committed.\n\nAs for skills I’m playing around with adding more that can somewhat take the place of frequently used MCPs, similar in style to dev-browser. Another reference to this style would be the blog posts by Cloudflare and then Anthropic. \n\nFeel like I’m probably in the same boat as you though and underutilizing some of these newer tools, so interested to see what others have to say.",

Expert advice: Using Claude Code itself is the most effective way to understand how skills and other context improvements would help. In plan mode, with thinking on, ask:\n\n* *\"Based on its codebase and everything else you know about this project, are there any skills which would make you more effective as a coding assistant?\"*\n\n* *\"Based on https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory, is my use of these types of memory optimal for this project? If not, how can we optimize it?\"*\n\n\"About this project\" and \"for this project\" are very important. No advice is the \"right\" answer for every project, so you'll get very different answers for very different projects.\n\nFollow Claude Code's recommendations, and enjoy your radically-better Claude Code experience.",

The learnings I have had is the issue with 'Amnesia', 'Continuity' and overall scoping. This led me down a HUGE freaking rabbit hole. My biggest issues were around Task management not context management alone. There are SOOOOO many tools out there for 'Memory' this and 'context' that but my issue was really stringing those memories together and the LLM AGENT first approach to how it all worked and interfaced.\n\nLike you I kept feeling like I was missing out on some bigger more powerful workflows. I have spent the past several weeks really honing all my years of general SDev knowledge and use of AI-assisted tools to build out what I am calling 'CLEO' that at it's core is a Project Task Management system. Ultimately I would like this to be provider agnostic but my main stay is CC so it is what I know and optimized it for. Technically the tool can work for ANY CLI agent but best with CC.\n\nI am currently working on a plugin tool to help CC use it more optimally instead of context injection I am doing now. Also I am toying with Agent Orchestration tooling using TMUX and prompt injection with headless monitored agents all controlled by scoped sessions > tasks.\n\nHonestly I may be over-engineering the damn thing and overthinking it but I have had HUGE wins recently with some Brownfield projects that I am thinking I may be on to something.\n\nI would like to get more community support in really putting it through its paces. PLEASE feel free to tear it apart and tell me I am crazy but maybe you might find some good mileage out of it:  \n[https://github.com/kryptobaseddev/cleo](https://github.com/kryptobaseddev/cleo) \n\n  \nI am working on trying to add more visuals to the README and documents but CLEO's best work is invisible. JSON validation, exit codes, atomic writes, checksum verification - all critical for agents, all boring to screenshot.

                  "text": "Lovely. I think integrating scripts + web search is so powerful to improve token efficiency and grounding (LLM’s are not temporally up to date). So many applications for scripts like reading, editing, storing, organizing, validating too. I think integration of scripts is the most powerful feature/lift. If you pack scripts with LLM api calls/databases/other tools, can take this even further. Separately, I’ve tried packing many references into a skill and noticed the number of references are often redundant / lead to much quicker compaction which leads to reduced quality. You should have Opus really focus on either abstracting / generalizing enough so it can compress the skill around frameworks and scripts instead of relying on too many references. Test it out. I learned the hard way 😭after using a similar approach with 100+ skills and deeply nested references. It’s actually better to split skills as much as possible so it’s easier for the model to make a decision to use it. I would instead just optimize the scripts + description in yaml frontmatter. If you for example have a full workflow in a skill with nested references and an agent loads the deep skill it’ll forget the prior instructions, but if you were to give it an overview / abstraction and then have separate skills that it should use later on, this is much more productive.",

This solves the \"context tax\" problem where a giant CLAUDE.md loads on every conversation.\n\nHow to actually use it:\n\n\n\n  1. Slash commands (most reliable trigger):\n\n\\- /superpowers:brainstorm I want to add user authentication — Claude will ask you ONE question at a time to refine your design before writing any code\n\n\\- /superpowers:write-plan — Generates detailed implementation plans with exact file paths\n\n\\- /superpowers:execute-plan — Runs tasks with code review gates between each step\n\n\n\n  2. Natural language trigger (what other commenters mentioned):\n\n\\- \"Let's brainstorm this feature using superpowers\"\n\n\\- \"Debug this systematically with superpowers\"\n\n\n\nThe key insight: Superpowers doesn't just help you code—it enforces a workflow. The brainstorming skill forces Claude to understand your requirements before jumping to implementation. The TDD skill has an \"Iron Law\" that deletes code written before tests. The debugging skill requires root cause investigation before proposing fixes.\n\nTwo killer features you might not realize:\n\n\n\n  1. Session independence — Plans save to docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md. Start a new session, type \"read docs/plans and continue\", and Claude picks up exactly where you left off.\n\n  2. Token efficiency — Core bootstrap is \\~2,000 tokens vs a 5,000-line CLAUDE.md loading every time. Heavy work goes to subagents with isolated context.\n\n\n\nAs Simon Willison (Django co-creator) said about the creator Jesse Vincent: \"one of the most creative users of coding agents I know.\"\n\nI wrote a detailed breakdown covering Plan Mode vs Superpowers comparison, real-world results, and the full skills library: [https://jsonobject.com/claude-code-superpowers-agentic-coding](https://jsonobject.com/claude-code-superpowers-agentic-coding)",

      "text": "TLDR - Opus 4.5 figured out a solution through Claude-Code CLI, which ChatGPT/Claude Website missed out due to lack of context (or maybe skills).\n\nI'm a founder with 7 yrs of experience in tech, handled 10M users for two tech companies. I'm technical enough to get by without needing a DevOps for AWS. But sometimes, while doing trial and error, there's a lot of side effects that get introduced to the system when doing something custom, especially with very hyper specific config.\n\nI always believed that DevOps would be the last thing to be decimated in tech because it's super challenging to navigate the lot of configuration and details.  \nEnter Claude Code + AWS CLI unlocked the DevOps in me. I truly feel like I don't need a DevOps for stuff now (I don't mean it in a condescending way). AWS is too much information and a lot of things to remember on the Console. It takes a decent amount of time to navigate to a solution.\n\nI needed to build a custom proxy for my application and route it over to specific routes and allow specific paths. It looks like an easy, obvious thing to do, but once I started working on this, there were incredibly too many parameters in play like headers, origins, behaviours, CIDR, etc. Every deployment takes like 5 mins to fully work, and I exhaustively tried everything that ChatGPT and Claude Website asked me to do. But nothing came of it. In fact, kinda fucked a bit. Spent 4.5 hrs on this issue and it was needle in a haystack for real (and you'll see why).\n\n*Light bulb monment* \\- Wait, why can't I just do it in AWS CLI and let Claude Code do the config lookups and clean up my mess. And boy did it. It started polling all the configs of the AWS setup through CLI, got sanity checks done, and in 4 mins, found out the issue, which is not obvious from the AWS Console at all. It reset my fuckups and started polling queries to get achieved what I wanted. 7 mins later, it wrote a CF Function, changed ARNs correctly, configured the right paths, and deployed the proxy.\n\nAll I did was sit there and see it complete all the CLI commands and some sanity checks. Best part is it got every single CLI command right. Every!\n\nIf I were to do what CC did manually, first look up commands, then copy paste right ARNs, configs, paths, functions, etc would take 45 mins at best and I'd still fuck up. It cost me $6.8 for CC credits (I'm not a very regular on CC).\n\nAgentic CLI for DevOps is an insane unlock. You don't need to even log into your AWS Console to fix or deploy. I'm not going back ever again to fix things the regular way. Opus 4.5 is surreal, and this wasn't possible on Sonnet 3.5 or 4.7. I had tried something like this before, and this feels like micro-AGI. I'm not sure if skills were picked from Claude Code servers. Somebody from Anthropic please confirm.\n\nIs there an AWS CLI [Skillls.md](http://Skillls.md) that we don't know about? How is it this good?",

My instructions to Claude are good enough for it to figure out my intent and to continue to search for a solution until it finds it.  I'm guessing my instructions to Codex are NOT clear enough for it to understand, nor does it really care about the context.  It's trying to execute exactly what I told it to do, and if it can't, then it simply stops.\n\nWhen I want my app pushed to a dev server for testing, I want it pushed.  I don't care how it does it or what the steps were. I want to be able to enter the URL and have the app appear.  Claude does a much better job of getting me to that point.  This is especially true when setting up new servers, but you MUST go behind it to make sure you don't have gaping security holes.  \n\nBut honestly, with the latest versions of Sonnet and Opus, it very rarely puts me in an undesirable position, whereas Codex just tells me to go pound sand.",
