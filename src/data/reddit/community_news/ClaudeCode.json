It scans for adversarial instructions in email text, checks for hidden text in HTML (such as white text on a white background), and analyzes behavioral context to see if an email is trying to manipulate an AI into unsafe actions.\n* **SentinelOne:** SentinelOne’s autonomous security platform detects and stops indirect prompt injections in real time by monitoring for malicious instructions embedded in external content like emails.\n* **Trend Vision One™ ZTSA (AI Service Access):** This tool provides advanced prompt injection detection by monitoring AI usage, inspecting prompts and responses, and analyzing AI content to prevent potential manipulation.\n* **Azure AI Content Safety (Prompt Shields):** Microsoft provides \"Prompt Shields\" which act as a unified API to analyze inputs for both direct and indirect prompt injection attacks, particularly effective for protecting LLM-based applications.\n* **DataDog LLM Observability:** This tool includes default scanning rules and \"out-of-the-box\" security checks that can flag prompt injections by identifying semantic similarity with known jailbreaks, allowing for inspection of full traces in the Datadog UI. \n\ni looked at qwen guard model but it doesn’t classify or check for prompt injections.",

Not that I can solve it practically, but I don’t see why Anthropic can’t. \n\nIf you think about it, it’s the same in real life; the most simple example being, you teach kids, don’t open the front door! At some point your kids start telling you that there is someone at the door so you can open it, beyond that they ask “who is it?” and if is mum or dad they let them in. Next, they eventually learn that when mum and dad are expecting a friend over they can answer the door, but when the open it if the Persian standing behind the peep hole is wearing a hockey mask and holding a chainsaw, they don’t open it, and finally at the point the nativity fades enough that the can defend the door, at least in a battle of intents if not physically they may open the door freely and decide what to do themselves. \n\nThe key is that it begins with knowing who you can trust! Sure someone might answer “it’s dad” In dad’s voice and gain entry through deception but that wouldn’t work if you gave your child a 2FA or a crypto signing tool for every door request, would it?\n\nYou can extrapolate that example to employees and beyond, and yeah, employees whose bosses have their email hacked do stupid shit all the time! But that proves the issue is one of identity and knowing what functions have consequences your boss wants a say in!!\n\nI might put Claude code to task of building a system 😂 it already has hooks that are forced to run before and after a tool use!",

You can basically completely create your own interface for working, both in the main editor and quick overlays you can make.  You can turn containers into accordions, tabs, or regular splits.  Has an mcp with full control over the ide.\n\nI havnt decided what I’m doing with it yet, I just made it for my own use because none of the other IDE’s do what I want.   I might open source it but I’m not sure. I also found issues with how Claude code and codex work, so I made my own versions (plus gui wrappers for Claude code, codex, and Gemini cli)",

It helps me focus on app features and other things while avoiding a lot of cluttered terminal windows. It's quite basic right now, and I have ideas for many other features to speed up development. My plan is to automate as much as possible. Currently, I have to manually trigger different phases, but I want a more automated system where I'm notified where my input is needed. Ideally, it should work independently, and I only need to specify the roadmap. I'm not sure if this is achievable until the end, but it already helps me speed up a bit. The audience can also be more non-technical people who don't want to mess with terminals and other things.",

      "text": "I just want to say \"thanks\" to whoever is riding Opus 4.5 into the ground on $4600 x20 subs, because at this point Opus 4.5 feels like it's performing on the same level as Sonnet 4.5, or even worse in some cases.\n\n\n\nBack in December, Opus 4.5 was honestly insane. I was one of the people defending it and telling others it was just a skill issue if they thought Sonnet was better. Now I'm looking at the last couple of weeks and it really doesn't feel like a skill issue at all, it feels like a straight up downgrade.\n\n\n\nFor the last two weeks Opus 4.5 has been answering on roughly Sonnet 4.5 level, and sometimes below. It legit feels like whatever \"1T parameter monster\" they were selling got swapped out for something like a 4B active parameter model. The scale of the degradation feels like 80–95%, not some tiny tweak.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Sonnet 4.5 actually surprised me in a good way. It definitely feels a bit nerfed, but if I had to put a number on it, maybe around 20% drop at worst, not this complete brain wipe. It still understands what I want most of the time and stays usable as a coding partner.\n\n\n\nOpus on the other hand just stopped understanding what I want:\n\n\\- it keeps mixing up rows of buttons in UI tasks\n\n\\- it ignores rules and conventions I clearly put into [claude.md](http://claude.md) or the system prompt\n\n\\- it confidently says it did something while just skipping steps\n\n\n\nI've been using Claude Code since the Sonnet 3.7 days, so this is not my first rodeo with this tool. I know how to structure projects, how to give it context, how to chunk tasks. I don't have a bunch of messy MSP hacks or some cursed setup. Same environment, same workflow, and in that exact setup Sonnet 4.5 is mostly fine while Opus 4.5 feels like a random unstable beta.\n\n\n\nAnd then I recently read about this guy who's \"vibecoding\" on pedals with insane usage like it's a sport. Thanks to clowns like that, it honestly feels like normal devs can't use these models at full power anymore, because everything has to be throttled, rate limited or quietly nerfed to keep that kind of abuse somewhat under control.\n\n\n\nFrom my side it really looks like a deliberate downgrade pattern: ship something amazing, build hype, then slowly \"optimize\" it until people start asking if they're hallucinating the drop in quality. And judging by other posts and bug reports, I'm clearly not the only one seeing this.\n\n\n\nSo if you're sitting there thinking \"maybe I just don't know how to use Opus properly\" – honestly, it's probably not you. Something under the hood has definitely been touched in a way that makes it way less reliable than it was in December.",

I’m on highest tier plans on both, and I swear, I’d dump Opus 4.5 at the door if Codex 5.2 was much faster!

I just paid $200 for the GPT 5.2 Pro plan because I am building some complex shit in languages I dont know very well (yet.. learning as I use them in AI). I read that GPT 5.2 XHigh was VERY good with algo/math stuff, CC 4.5 Opus still best for 95% of coding, and Gemini great at plans. So  I paid the $200 for GPT2.5 to get it to \"review\" what CC says.. poke holes, respond.. then feed that back in to CC. Only problem for me is the 5.2 seems to go for hours and then fails. I upload a few source files (13 to 20 files tops), a prompt, some \"results\" CC came up with.. and send GPT on its way.. and man.. it goes for HOURS and usually fails. Just hangs. No response for 2+ hours.. I finally refresh.. and it starts again. If I type ANYTHING it starts again. VERY frustrating because I am unclear wtf I am doing wrong. CC just works.. I can stop it, not lose anything, not lose context.. add to it, etc. GPT seems to forget everything and start fresh every time I resubmit. I explained that to GPT and Gemini.. both said \"Tell it to return stuff sooner\" basically.. which I did.. basically \"while you work on this can you respond with updates every 10 to 15 mins so I know what is going on\". It says it will, it never does. So.. I dont know WTF is going on. The few times I DID get it to respond, I folded that back in to Claude and it seems to have worked well enough.  Claude usually responds with \"GPT is spot  on.. this is great.. I missed this..\" etc.",

So, Claude Code uses a local claude.json file for config, and for some people this file can get corrupted. Keep in mind, this file is local, so Claude for Desktop has a separate one from Web Claude which has a separate one from your VSCode extension or terminal Claude, which explains why it can perform differently for different platforms for the same user account. \n\nThis file can get corrupted in several ways, so I’d recommend checking it to ensure it’s in order. You should see either practically nothing or just global config settings (having nothing in the file is normal, this file is actually NOT meant to store memory or conversations, just settings you’ve updated and MCP servers you’ve added, along with other config info)\n\nThere are also several other .json configuration files that govern Claude Code so maybe look into those as well.

Let's hope in time open source models reach the level of opus 4.5 is at on a good day today, maybe 2-3 years from now? When they do, honestly I think there's a bit of a plateau we've already reached. I mean I can't imagine much I couldn't do with Opus right now that I'd want to do and Gemini isn't the complete painting yet but it's getting closer so the competition will keep them relatively \"honest\".",

Feels like they spent a lot of time getting the triggers to work, which can be kinda hit and miss with skills. Interestingly their skills can’t be explicitly invoked but they have GSD equivalent commands that then invoke the skills. It’s also comes as a Claude code plugin which makes way more sense for cc than npm.  In general though I like how these newer frameworks work natively with cc’s system, as opposed to super complex RAG, semantic search, blah blah blah.  How is open code btw?",

      "text": "\nHey everyone,\n\nYesterday I released my first game. A retro football manager, playable on Android, PC, and in the browser. 6 months ago I had never written a line of GDScript and didn't know what Godot was. I want to share what I learned along the way – maybe it helps someone who's thinking about a bigger project.\n\nI'm not a developer. I work a full-time job that has nothing to do with tech. I have a toddler at home, which means my coding window was 10pm to midnight, after everyone was asleep. I used the 5x plan and still hit the daily limit more often than I'd like to admit.\n\nWhat I wanted to build: a football manager like the ones I played as a teenager in the 90s. Simple graphics, deep gameplay, no pay-to-win nonsense. The kind of game I'd actually want to play on my commute.\n\nThe search for the right tool\n\nBefore I could build anything, I needed to figure out which AI tool could actually handle a project this size. That part alone took about 1-2 months.\n\nI started with Gemini. The generated code had constant bugs, and it struggled to keep context across files. So I switched to ChatGPT, but the context window was too small – after 3-4 files it would forget what I was building and suggest things that contradicted earlier decisions. Cursor was better, but something still felt off for longer projects.\n\nThen I found Claude Code, and things finally clicked. What made the difference: it actually remembers my project. I could say \"the TransferManager needs to talk to the SaveGameService\" and it knew what I meant without me explaining the entire architecture again. That alone saved hours every week.\n\nOne thing I didn't expect: I could write all my prompts in German – my native language. Claude handled it fine. Code stayed in English (variable names, comments, everything), but explanations came in German. I had to remind it every 2-3 prompts (\"please respond in German\"), but once I accepted that as part of the workflow, it felt much more natural than forcing myself to think in English at 11pm.\n\nThe process that worked\n\nWith the right tool in place, I needed a way to actually structure the work. The most important decision I made was to not start coding immediately.\n\nInstead, I sat down and mapped out the entire project first. Not just \"I want to build a game\" but breaking it into 8 playable mini-projects. First: a basic loop where you pick a team and simulate a match. Then: match events like goals and injuries. Then: cup competitions. And so on. Every time I finished one of these kernels, I had something that actually worked. Those small wins kept me going through the months when progress felt slow.\n\nTo keep Claude on track across all these features, I wrote down my project rules in a file called claude.md – architecture decisions, naming conventions, how managers communicate with each other. The key was keeping it precise: few words, but the right ones. Here's the thing though: Claude doesn't automatically remember this file. I had to reference it every 2-3 prompts. \"Remember claude.md\" or \"follow the architecture from claude.md.\" Otherwise it would drift and do its own thing. Annoying at first, but once I accepted this as part of the workflow, it actually worked well.\n\nThis discipline extended to how I approached every new feature. I never let Claude just start coding. Instead, every feature started with: \"Here's what I want to do. Here's my approach. Do you agree? Any problems you see?\" Only after we agreed on the plan did I say \"okay, implement it.\" This caught so many issues before they became bugs buried in 50 files.\n\nOf course, not everything went smoothly. Some bugs took 2 minutes to fix. Others took 100+ prompts. The EU cup bracket system nearly broke me – home and away legs, aggregate scoring, away goals rule. Teams that should have been eliminated kept advancing. I spent three evenings on this, prompt after prompt. At some point I wasn't even sure if the \"fix\" was actually correct or just moving the bug somewhere else.\n\nThat experience taught me something important: you cannot blindly trust AI-generated code. So I started reading every single line Claude produced. Not because I'm paranoid – okay, maybe a little – but because that's how I learned. When something didn't work, debugging together taught me more than any tutorial could have.\n\nAnd then there were the days when nothing worked at all. Same prompt, different results. Sometimes Claude would nail it on the first try. Other days, garbage output no matter how I rephrased things. I started thinking of it like a casino – some days you're lucky, some days you're not. Eventually I learned to recognize when Claude was \"having a bad day\" and just try again tomorrow instead of burning through my daily limit on a lost cause.\n\nOne bright spot through all of this: GDScript and Godot worked incredibly well. Better than I expected. The model seems well-trained on it, which made the actual game development smoother than the debugging sessions might suggest. And I kept the setup simple – no plugins, no MCP servers, nothing fancy. Just Claude Code out of the box. I tried some plugins early on but dropped them. The base tool is trained well enough.\n\nBeyond the code\n\nHere's what surprised me most about this whole journey: I didn't just use Claude Code for the game itself. Once I got comfortable with it, I started using it for everything around the project too.\n\nI built two websites – one for the game, one for my publisher brand. Both are trilingual (German, English, Turkish). Landing pages, legal pages, the whole thing. Claude Code wrote the HTML, CSS, handled the translations, even helped with the SEO structure.\n\nAnd all the marketing content came from Claude Code too. Reddit posts, store descriptions, changelogs for 30+ versions, Discord announcements. I'd describe what I needed, it would draft something, I'd edit and refine, and repeat. The amount of text a game release needs is insane – having an AI assistant made it actually manageable.\n\nSo in the end, this wasn't just \"I built a game with AI.\" It was: I built a game, two websites, and all the marketing material. Three platforms (Android, PC, Web). Three languages. With zero programming background. That still feels surreal to write.\n\nWhat I'd do again\n\nLooking back, a few things made the real difference. Planning first – seriously mapping it out before touching code. Keeping the rules file short but precise, and referencing it constantly. Never skipping plan mode. Reading every line. Accepting the casino days instead of fighting them.\n\nIf I could tell myself something at the start, it would be: expect to spend time finding the right tool. Those 1-2 months I \"lost\" on tools that didn't work weren't wasted – they taught me what to look for. And if you're working in a non-English language: try prompting in your native language. It might work better than you expect.\n\nOne more thing: my toddler kept me sane. Forces you to stop at midnight. Forces you to step away when you're stuck in a debugging spiral. Boundaries turned out to be a feature, not a bug.\n\nWhat came out of it\n\n6 months total, including the tool search. Maybe 360 hours of actual work. 120 GDScript files. 22 autoload managers. Match simulation with live events. Transfers, contracts, finances. European cups with group stages and knockout rounds. Stadium editor. Career mode from club manager to national coach. Three languages. Two websites. All the marketing material.\n\n\nIs it perfect? No. There are rough edges. But it exists. It works. People can play it. That's more than I had 6 months ago.\n\nCurious about other people's experience with longer projects. How do you handle the context drift? The \"bad days\"? Would love to hear what worked for you.\n\nHappy to answer in German too – ich antworte gerne auf Deutsch!",

I have never built frrontends before so any time I instruct CC to update my JS, I leave some ambiguity, or I propose an idea and ask it for a recommendation based on engineering best practices.\n\nTo answer your question on large projects:\n\nI ran into similar issues and started to build nested [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) files within each subfolder. This helped quite a bit, but it killed my context since Claude reads these md files automatically every time it is initiated. I have now opted to build skills instead. In essence, skills docs are practically the same thing as my nested [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) docs, but Claude only reads them when it determines it needs to based on the current context.\n\nI also use a new Claude session for each single update. Never compact, always clear. [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) and skills make that much easier to do.",

My target languages have been Java and Dart.  CC separates functionality into seemingly logical classes but the separation is poor and CC starts throwing flags, getters and listeners everywhere rather than refactor.

The discipline and project management behind this are what made it real. The 500-line rule you mentioned is gold. I've found 300-400 is the sweet spot where Claude still holds the full file's logic in context without drift. Beyond that it starts \"forgetting\" edge cases in earlier functions when editing later ones. How did you approach splitting when a feature naturally wanted to be 800+ lines? Did you split by layer (data/logic/UI) or by sub-feature?",

Its also a really fun experience iterating on ideas this way. Another things for efficiency is to learn claude to run the game itself and to make it customize the debug trace for each run so that it gets the right info and \\_only\\_ the right info when debugging a problem. Saves time and tokens I've found so far. Would be interesting to hear others experience with that.\n\nThanks for sharing your experience.",

AI just isn't there yet for creating motion graphics, so I'll probably do those manually or use proper animation tools and only let Claude handle the integration part.\n\nBiggest takeaway: keep code files under 500 lines. Above that, AI starts making dumb mistakes. Learned that the hard way.",

I use Opus sparingly in CC, mostly Sonnet for planning and Haiku for execution of simple tasks. \n\nI have a basic GirHub copilot subscription at $10/mo that I use quite often to stretch my CC limits. I am considering picking up CODEX/GPT again for a couple months with a discount offer. I haven't had a sub for a few months and would like to see how it's evolved. \n\nI've been leaning into CLI over IDE for agent orchestration and tools with GitHub integrations for workflow automation. Writing detailed GH issues then assigning to an agent that does the work, creates a PR, another agent does PR review. I'm not letting them merge and deploy yet. \n\nI'd like to try Opus in full throttle to see if it's everything it's claimed to be, but it's only a bit smarter than the closest competitors; GPT 5.2 and Gemini 3 are both strong coders. Beyond the model, the app is what's doing the context management,  system prompts, and tool use. Each has its own opinionated SDD implementation that weighs heavily on overall quality. \n\nI encourage devs to try different tools, they are rapidly evolving and borrowing best ideas from each other. Hopefully we see more standards emerge like AGENTS.md, Skills, MCP, A2A. I'd love to see something like CC hooks more widely available.",

In brief:\n\n* Use affirmatives rather than negatives when telling Claude what to do\n* Only share what's _absolutely necessary_\n* One context = one task. Do not mix tasks. When one task is finished, clear context and continue\n* Aggressively compact - if your context hits 50% without the task being well underway or finished, you're doing something wrong\n* Use both a global CLAUDE.md and a project-level CLAUDE.md. Make them both *as brief as you possibly can*\n\nIn general, *every* token in your context is going to affect Claude, including tokens piped in from your CLAUDE.md files. The more tokens you have in your context that have nothing to do with what you're working on, the dumber your Claude is going to get and the more stuff it's going to forget and/or ignore. Therefore, the *better* you are at managing your context, the *smarter* your Claude is going to be. It really does make a HUGE difference.\n\nClaude Code is great but it's ultimately still a tool, which means it can be used right and it can be used wrong. I wish people would stop automatically assuming it's the hammer that's broken when so many are holding it by its wrong end and trying to punch in a nail with the handle.",

I know can do these things, but given that it is up to claude deciding to follow your rules, and things like sub-agent types being something you just want to work. Some of this more fundamental orchestration machinery feels like it should be external and programatic. What I mean is that when claude goes to route something he uses some kind of skill and that runs an external programatic process which makes the orchestration much more predictable. If you've ever tried to have claude work on 362 tasks to complete a feature you know it can sometimes be difficult to guarantee that he finishes across multiple sessions.  \n\nWe tend to give everything to Claude first, but I think we should also be assessing what we can pull back from him and give to traditional programatic code. Ideally you'd replace everything until 80%+ is programatic code.  Like a process of claude assimilating and building his own appendages.",

But in the past week the model has been so poor that I'm becoming properly convinced the model has become dumber as a compromise. I'm wondering if there is kind of a lottery effect here going on, (e.g. with what quant precision you're getting depending on usage, region or just random). Obviously they do trade-offs to meet with the demand, but this just isn't the same model to me anymore. Am I going crazy here or does anyone else share the feeling?\n\nEdit:\n\nMore posts popping up seem to confirm this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1qisw7h/claude\\_opus\\_45\\_and\\_sonnet\\_45\\_underperformed\\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1qisw7h/claude_opus_45_and_sonnet_45_underperformed_on/)\n\nEdit 2:\n\nThose calling it context rot should probably take a breather.

It has built in dangerous command detection, and it's own host of helpful features. Now ccode doesn't delete files it shouldn't AND I'm notified about it, never gets the cwd wrong, and it never fucks up file path syntax or shell context.

That, coupled with a janitor and code-reviewer subagents, and I don't have problems with frontend code generation anymore.\n\nDoes the model's working quality seem to degrade over time after release? Yes. But given some TLC and finesse, that degradation has proven to be completely mitigated.. at least for my own use cases. And I use ccode in production software development every single day.",

          "text": "Just had CLAUDE create me the ideal agents directory for my codebase, it created me 12 agents. Consumed nearly my entire 5 hour limit in one go, basically.\n\nI opened the next chat, explained the previous, told it to look at the last plan CLAUDE had created (the plan for the above, previous chat) -- it said my agents are incorrect, they should be skills/commands instead. I let it convert them to commands after verifying 3 times that they should be commands and not skills. It was SURE they were supposed to be commands. I let it convert them to commands.\n\nAfterward, I asked \"So, these are commands, these are no longer agents? How do I go about creating AGENTS or subagents?\"\n\nThe response?\n\n\"That’s an important distinction, so let me clarify what Claude Code actually supports and correct a mistake I made earlier.\n\nClaude Code supports two different concepts that behave very differently: commands and subagents.\n\nCommands (located in .claude/commands/) are manually invoked using /command-name. They load context or instructions into your current conversation, and you decide when and whether to use them.\n\nSubagents (located in .claude/agents/) are handled automatically by Claude. You describe a task, and Claude decides whether to delegate it to a subagent. Subagents run in isolated contexts with their own model and tool configuration. They cannot be invoked by name and must be defined with YAML frontmatter describing their model, tools, and purpose.\n\nWhat this means is that the original setup with the 12 files in .claude/agents/ was actually correct. Those files were valid subagent definitions, and the YAML frontmatter was required. Claude uses them automatically when a task matches their description.\n\nThe mistake I made earlier was moving those files into .claude/commands/, which is the wrong location, and stripping out the YAML frontmatter, which subagents need in order to function.\n\nThe correct setup is to keep subagent definitions in .claude/agents/ with their YAML frontmatter intact and allow Claude to automatically select and use them based on task intent. Commands in .claude/commands/ should only be used for manually invoked slash commands.\"\n\n  \nYes, I used GPT on web to reformat that response so it wasn't a mess like when copied from the terminal lol\n\nSo.. it took almost an entire 5 hour window to create my agents in the prior chat, then almost another full 5 hour window in the second chat for it to \"ABSOLUTELY SURE!\" that my agents were commands. Then.. it says, oh I was wrong, let me fix that..",

But for no discernible reason. (The changes in the context / peompt seemed entirely unrelated)\n\n—-\n\nSo my mental model now is:\n\nThe models are justnot reliable or trustworthy, and there is no magic prompt that will make them follow all the instructions / constraints, because as soon as you get it to follow one constraint it will randomly start ignoring others (because any random change in the prompt could lead to random ignoring of constraints it was following before)\n\nTherefore, you have to micromanage to get reasonable results.\n\n—-\n\nI think the reason why people think it “gets worse” is because of \n- Random variations,\n- As they get deeper into a project details matter more and there are more constraints. (Whereas in the beginning it’s just rough prototyping with few constraints which the models are better at)\n\nI also noticed there was a big wave of “it’s dumber now” posts a certain period of time after the karpathy post started insane hype for Opus 4.5. I think it’s because a lot of people got into new projects over the winter holidays and were hyped initially, but at a certain point they got deeper into the project and it all started falling apart. Because lots of people went through this same arc at roughly the same time, the “it’s getting dumber” narrative started gaining massive traction in social media (I was a part of that)",

Most engineers skip right past them, but they completely changed my workflow.\n\nWrote a deep dive covering everything I wish I knew when I started.\n\n**What hooks let you do:**\n- Run your own code at any point in Claude Code's workflow\n- 13 different events to hook into (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Notification, Stop, etc.)\n- Block, allow, or modify actions before they happen\n- Add context, send notifications, enforce workflows\n\n**What I cover in the post:**\n- All 13 hook events explained with examples\n- The data flow (JSON stdin → your logic → JSON stdout)\n- Exit codes and what they mean\n- Python vs Node.js for hooks (spoiler: Node for high-frequency events)\n- Ready-to-use safety hooks\n\n**The hooks I use daily:**\n1. Block dangerous commands (rm -rf ~/, force push main, fork bombs)\n2. Protect secrets (.env, SSH keys, AWS creds)\n3. Slack notifications when Claude needs input\n\n**Blog post:** https://karanbansal.in/blog/claude-code-hooks\n\n**GitHub repo:** https://github.com/karanb192/claude-code-hooks\n\nThis is part 1 - more coming on prompt-based hooks, context injection, and session memory.\n\nWhat hooks are you all building?",

              "text": "My understanding is simple:\n\n1. Hook: When you need it before, after, or while Claude is doing something, it runs a script externally. It has nothing to do with AI, like planning a trip where you need to refuel at point A and find a supermarket to eat at point B.\n2. Subagents: Imagine you have multiple Claude Code instances. Each one does a different task, and each instance has a different context. It only focuses on its task, meaning it's not affected by the context of other instances, so it only executes the instruction passed to it, which in this case is the Main Agent. Practical use cases: searching for relevant files to synthesize the problem, or an agent reading files like PROGRESS.md or ROADMAP.md to track your progress and return the information to the Main Agent. This way, the Main Agent doesn't waste many steps, as each tool call consumes unnecessary tokens.\n3. Skills: It's not like a Subagent, nor is it like a markdown document that you reference:\n   * It simply branches the context (if you allow it in the frontmatter), inserts the skill content, uses it at the right time, returns the result, and the AI ​​forgets that skill content, preventing token inflation.\n   * Or, if it doesn't branch, Skills are still different because they support running scripts. Like an upgrade to Hooks, but triggered by AI.\n4. Plugins & Marketplace: This is just a place to gather all of the above during installation. The Marketplace is used to install plugins containing hooks, subagents, skills, etc., and for auto-updates.\n\nHopefully, this will be helpful to those who need it. Please help me correct anything I haven't understood correctly. 🤗",

      "text": "I made a video breaking down Ralph from first principles. Geoffrey Huntley (the creator of the loop) reached out and designated it as the official explainer.\n\nIn short: Ralph Wiggum is an autonomous coding loop that lets your Claude work through an implementation plan in your codebase while you sleep.\n\nHere are the key takeaways:\n\n**Skip the plugin** \\- Do not use Anthropic's Ralph plugin, it degrades performance by keeping each loop in the same context window.\n\n**Exploration mode** \\- My favorite way to use Ralph. When I have remaining tokens in my max plan, I brain dump and converse for \\~10 minutes with Claude and set up Ralph the night before usage resets. Lets him test, explore, and/or build an idea I've had to put on the backburner.\n\n**True simplicity** \\- Ralph is literally just a bash while loop that calls Claude in headless mode until a stopping criteria is met. This simplicity gives us power users a broad ability to tailor autonomous loops to our own systems and ideas.\n\n**Fresh context** \\- Instead of letting context accumulate and degrade, Ralph treats each iteration as a fresh context window. The spec and implementation plan become the source of truth, not previous conversation history. This sidesteps context rot entirely.\n\n**Spec sizing** \\- Your specs and implementation plan need to leave enough room for implementation within each loop. If your spec is too bloated, you risk hitting the \"dumb zone\" during every single iteration.\n\n**Bidirectional planning** \\- Have you and Claude both ask each other questions until your specs and implementation plan are fully aligned. This surfaces implicit assumptions, which are typically the source of most bugs.\n\n**You own the spec** \\- Since we are treating the specs as the source of truth, it is our job to read every line and edit it ourselves. Without bulletproof specs that make sense to us, Ralph will go off the rails.\n\nFull video link (for the full rundown on how Ralph actually works): [https://youtu.be/I7azCAgoUHc](https://youtu.be/I7azCAgoUHc)",

              "text": "I gotchu here bro. The dumb zone is a term for the point where context rot starts to heavily decrease performance. This is because you can think of LLMs as having a finite amount of attention which is basically how much weight they can put into what previous tokens in the conversation at each step of generating the next token. This finite attention gets stretched thin when there are too many tokens in context (since attention weights must sum to 1 across all tokens in context). Not only this, but tokens in the middle of the conversation start to get ignored, in a phenomenon called 'lost in the middle'. Also any irrelevant or contradictory tokens (commonly found in [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) files) cause attention to be given to the wrong places. All of this results in increased hallucination rate, decreased instruction following quality, and a 'dumber' model over all. Hope this helps",

It is super easy to implement but gives no customizability and can result in bad planning habits because it is quicker. Ralph on the other hand is infinitely customizable and when done right, the user has to have a high level of knowledge in context management and handoff management. I like to think their differences are analogous to the difference between leaving autocompact on and curating context with a /handoff command. So to answer your question, Ralph still has clear advantages for the power users and they are complementary tools due to the speed and simplicity of the task feature.",

      "text": "I've been using Claude Code daily since it launched in February 2025. Obsessively.\n\nAt this point I've spent hundreds of hours building, deleting, rebuilding, and being frustrated that it kept making the same mistakes.\n\nHere's a trimed version of a blog post I wrote earlier. I tried to trim as much as possible, but it's a lot of info 😅.\n\nHope it helps.\n\n\\-\n\n# 1.  Claude .md is non-negotiable \n\n[CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) is a file that Claude reads automatically every session. Without it, every session starts from zero. You re-explain your context, your preferences, your constraints. Every. Single. Time. \n\nI resisted this for weeks. Felt like unnecessary overhead. That stubbornness cost me dozens of hours.\n\n**The fastest way to create one: let Claude interview you.** \n\nNavigate to your project folder and say:\n\n*\"I need to create a* [*CLAUDE.md*](http://CLAUDE.md) *file for this project. Interview me to understand what this project is about, how I want things done, and what mistakes to avoid. Then create the file.\"* \n\nThe interview surfaces constraints and preferences you'd forget to document yourself. Claude asks questions you wouldn't think to answer.          \n\n\\-                                                          \n\n# 2. Context is THE most important thing\n\nClaude Code has a memory limit. When conversations get long, it \"compacts\" context - basically summarizing older stuff to make room. \n\nIf you've compacted, chances are you're too far gone and your results are going to start degrading.\n\nThe warning signs:\n\n\\- Suggesting ideas you already rejected\n\n\\- Forgetting constraints from earlier\n\n\\- Quality suddenly dropping\n\n\\- Going in circles\n\n\\- Repeating questions you already answered\n\n**The fix: When this happens, don't fight it. Type /clear and start fresh.**\n\nA clean context with clear instructions beats a degraded conversation every time.\n\nI know it feels wrong - you've invested time. But starting over is going to save you a lot of time and energy. A fresh start takes 5 minutes. Fighting a confused session can burn hours.                        \n\nThis is also why constantly pushing commits to GitHub is so important\n\n**My rule: if Claude Code can't fix it in 5 attempts or less, I /clear and try again.**  \n\n\\-\n\n# 3. Plan Mode first\n\nI used to just dive in with \"build \\_\\_\\_\".\n\nMore often than I'd like to admit, I'd come back 20 minutes later to find Claude had:            \n\n\\- Restructured my entire project in ways I never asked for \n\n\\- Deleted files I needed \n\n\\- Built something technically impressive that completely missed the point                                \n\n**Plan Mode tells Claude to think through the approach BEFORE doing any work.**                \n\nPress **Shift+Tab twice** to toggle it, or just say: \n\n*\"Before you do anything, create a detailed plan for \\[this task\\]. Show me the plan and wait for my approval before executing.\"*\n\nA good plan includes:\n\n\\- What Claude thinks you want\n\n\\- Steps to accomplish it   \n\n\\- Files it will create or modify \n\n\\- How it will verify success \n\n\\- What could go wrong\n\nReview it. Ask questions. Request changes. Only approve when confident\n\n**Plans also survive context compaction better than scattered conversation. When Claude summarizes old context, a clear structured plan is more likely to be preserved.**\n\n**-**\n\n# 4. The Plan-Then-Execute workflow\n\nThis is my most-used pattern now.                                                                                                  \n\n**Chat 1:** Create the plan. Back and forth. Get messy. Refine until it's right. Save the final approved plan.\n\n**Chat 2:** Start fresh. Paste the plan. Say \"Execute this step by step. After each major step, verify it's working before moving on.\"\n\n\\* Claude will auto-clear the context for you now.     \n\nWhy separate sessions? \n\n**Context.** The planning session gets cluttered with back-and-forth, rejected ideas, and exploration. Starting fresh for execution means clean context. The plan carries forward the important decisions. Claude has maximum context budget for actual work.  \n\nThink of it like cooking: Session 1 is writing the recipe. Session 2 is cooking the meal. You don't want to figure out the recipe while the stove is on. \n\n\\-\n\n# 5. Your prompts matter more than you think \n\n\"If I had 5 hours to vibe code, I would spend 4 hours of it polishing the prompt\"\n\n\\- Abraham Lincoln, probably\n\nI used to blame Claude for mediocre outputs. Then I looked back at my prompts and realized I barely understood what I wanted myself.\n\nVague prompts produce vague results. Specific prompts produce specific results.\n\n**A good prompt has four things:**   \n\n1. What files to look at\n2. What to find or create  \n3. What details to include \n4. What format to output                                                                                                                   \n\n**Bad:**\n\n\"Analyze this data\"\n\n**Good:**\n\n\"Analyze the customer feedback in /data. Find the top 5 complaints by frequency. For each, include: the exact quote that best represents it, how many times it appeared, which customer segment mentioned it most. Output as markdown table.\" \n\n**Give Claude a way to verify its work:**\n\n*\"Build me a report, then check that all the numbers in the summary match the totals in the raw data. If anything doesn't match, fix it before showing me.\"* \n\nWhen Claude can check its own work, errors get caught before reaching you.                         \n\n**Tell Claude what NOT to do:**\n\n\\- \"Don't create new folders. Work within the existing structure\"\n\n\\- \"Don't modify any files in /config\"\n\n\\- \"Don't round numbers. I need exact figures\"\n\nSometimes the most useful instruction is what to avoid.\n\n\\-\n\n# 6. Keep files small (~1000 lines max)\n\nI had a project with one 5,000+ line file. Claude would make changes to one part and accidentally break something in a completely different section. Took me hours of debugging to figure out what was going wrong.\n\nWhen Claude works with files, it loads them into context. Massive files eat up context budget and make it harder to work effectively.\n\nSmaller files = faster processing, targeted changes without side effects, and less risk of Claude touching stuff it didn't need to touch.\n\n**If you're building something new:**\n\n\"*Split this into separate files. Each file should handle one responsibility and be under 1000 lines.\"*\n\n**If working with existing large files:**  \n\n  *\"This file is too large. Suggest how to break it into smaller, focused modules.\"* \n\nDon't refactor everything at once. When you touch a file, check if it should be split. Improve incrementally.\n\n\\-\n\n# 7. The Task System (now built-in)\n\nThis used to be a workaround I recommended. Now it's official. \n\nClaude Code just shipped a proper task management system with dependency tracking (v2.1.16). The old \"todos\" got a serious upgrade.\n\nAsk Claude to create a task list:\n\n*\"Before you start, create a task list for this project. Mark which tasks depend on others. Include self-review checkpoints after each major phase. Then work through the list systematically.\"* \n\n**Why the new system matters:**\n\n\\- Tasks track dependencies (Task B automatically waits for Task A)\n\n\\- They survive context compaction better than conversation\n\n\\- Claude can parallelize independent tasks \n\n\\- If something fails, it knows exactly where to resume \n\n\\- Resource isolation means tasks don't interfere with each other \n\nThis was always the right technique. Now it's the right technique with native support.\n\nFor any task that takes more than a few minutes, this is essential.\n\n\\-\n\n# 8. Skills: Stop re-explaining your preferences \n\nYou know that thing where you explain your preferences to Claude for the fifteenth time and think \"why can't it just *remember* this?\" \n\nSkills fix that.\n\nSkills are reusable instruction sets Claude applies automatically. Your brand voice. Your report format. Your quality checklist. Teach Claude once, never re-explain again.\n\n**Without Skills:** You re-explain preferences every session.\n\n**With Skills:** Claude automatically applies your brand voice. Reports come out in your format. Error checks happen without asking. \n\nThe difference is consistency and convenience. My outputs actually feel like *mine*, not like generic AI slop.\n\n**How to create one:** \n\n1. Open a new claude code chat  \n2. Say: \"Help me build a skill for \\[your use case\\]\"      \n3. Describe what you want Claude to remember \n4. Claude generates a Skill file           \n5. Use it with /skill-name or tell Claude to use it in chat\n\n**Some Skill ideas:**     \n\n\\- Brand voice (how you sound, words to use/avoid)\n\n\\- Report formatting (standard structure, required sections)\n\n\\- Code review checklist (what to check, common mistakes)\n\n\\- Analysis framework (mental models, standard questions) \n\n\\-\n\n# 9. Sub-agents for parallel work\n\nThis is where it gets powerful.\n\nI was doing competitive analysis - 5 competitors, customer feedback analysis, synthesize into a report. Normally a full day or two\n\nTold Claude: spin up sub-agents to research each competitor in parallel while the main agent processed feedback. Combine everything at the end.\n\n45 minutes. A report that would've taken me days.\n\n**How to use them:**\n\n*\"Create a sub-agent to analyze our top 3 competitors while you process customer feedback. Then combine the insights into a single report.\"* \n\nor\n\n*\"Spin up parallel agents to process each of these 5 data files, then merge the results.\"*\n\nThe new task system makes this even better. You can now say: \n\n*\"Research competitors A, B, C in parallel. The synthesis task depends on all three completing.\"*\n\nClaude handles the orchestration. Less like one employee. More like a project manager with a team. \n\n\\-\n\n# 10. Know when to start over\n\nSometimes the fastest path forward is a clean restart. \n\nI used to stubbornly stick with sessions way too long, thinking \"I've already put so much time into this conversation.\" Classic sunk-cost thinking.\n\nThat mentality cost me more time than starting fresh ever would have.  \n\n**Start fresh when:**  \n\n\\- Output quality has noticeably dropped  \n\n\\- Claude is repeating itself or going in circles                   \n\n\\- You've changed direction significantly\n\n\\- The conversation has become cluttered with false starts\n\nNow my rule is simple: if I notice quality dropping, I stop. Save the output. Start fresh. No guilt.\n\n\\---\n\n**Common mistakes (so you don't repeat mine)**\n\n**\"Claude keeps forgetting what I told it\"**\n\nYour context is probably compacted. Start fresh. Make sure important info is in [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md), not just conversation.\n\n**\"Output quality is inconsistent\"**   \n\nCreate Skills for recurring needs. More context about your preferences = more consistent results. Also check if your files are getting too large.\n\n**\"Claude made changes I didn't want\"**  \n\nUse Plan Mode. Review the plan before approving. Set up hooks to create automatic backups. \n\n**\"Long tasks produce worse results than short ones\"**\n\nUse the task system. Break work into checkpoints. Split across multiple sessions if needed.\n\n\\---\n\nCandidly this is the condensed version. I wrote up [ https://masteringai.io/guides/ultimate-claude-code-guide-for-beginners ](https://masteringai.io/guides/ultimate-claude-code-guide-for-beginners) if you want to go deeper. It's free. I just want people to stop making the same mistakes I did.\n\n**Claude Code (and AI) has been an incredible tool for me, and for the first time in my life I've been able to bring every idea to life.**\n\nNo need to raise $8m funding like I did for my startup.\n\nMy obsession has gotten so bad I'm banned from talking about Claude Code with my friends, so here I am 😅.\n\nHope this helped.\n\nWhat's working (or not working) for everyone else? Curious what patterns others have found.",

      "text": "I want to start the post off with a disclaimer: \n\n>all the content within this post is merely me sharing what setup is working best for me currently and should not be taken as gospel or only correct way to do things. It's meant to hopefully inspire you to improve your setup and workflows with AI agentic coding. I'm just another average dev and this is just like, my opinion, man.\n\nLet's get into it.\n\nWell I wanted to share how I actually use Claude Code for legacy refactoring because I see a lot of people getting burned.\n\nThey point Claude at a messy codebase, type '*refactor this to be cleaner*', and watch it generate beautiful, modular code that doesn't work and then they spend next 2 days untangling what went wrong.\n\nI just finished refactoring 50k lines of legacy code across a `Django` monolith that hadn't been meaningfully touched in 4 years. \n\nIt took me 3 weeks without Claude Code, I'd estimate 2-3 months min but here's the thing: the speed didn't come from letting Claude run wild It came from a specific workflow that kept the refactoring on rails.\n\n**Core Problem With Legacy Refactoring**\n\nLegacy code is different from greenfield. There's no spec. All tests are sparse or nonexistent. Half the 'design decisions' were made by old dev who left the company in 2020 and code is in prod which means if you break something, real users feel it.\n\nClaude Code is incredibly powerful but it has no idea what your code is *supposed* to do. \n\nIt can only see what it *does* do right now but for refactoring, it's dangerous.\n\n**counterintuitive move**: before Claude writes a single line of refactored code, you need to lock down what the existing behavior actually is. Tests become your safety net, not an afterthought.\n\n**Step 1: Characterization Tests First**\n\nI don't start by asking Claude to refactor anything. \n\nI start by asking it to write tests that capture current codebase behavior.\n\n>**My prompt:** \"Generate minimal pytest characterization tests for \\[module\\]. Focus on capturing current outputs given realistic inputs. No behavior changes, just document what this code actually does right now.\"\n\nThis feels slow. You're not 'making progress' yet but these tests are what let you refactor fearlessly later. \n\nEvery time Claude makes a change, you run tests. If they pass, refactor preserved behavior. If they fail, you caught a regression before it hit prod.\n\nRepeated behaviour >>> Efficiency.\n\nI spent the first 4 days just generating characterization tests. \n\nBy end, I had coverage on core parts of codebase, stuff I was most scared to touch.\n\n  \n**Step 2: Set Up Your CLAUDE .md File**\n\n**<Don’t skip this one>**\n\nCLAUDE .md is a file that gets loaded into Claude's context automatically at the start of every conversation. \n\nThink of it as persistent memory for your project and for legacy refactoring specifically, this file is critical because Claude needs to understand not just how to write code but what it shouldn't touch.\n\n>You can run /init to auto-generate a starter file, it'll analyze your codebase structure, package files, and config. But treat that as a starting point. For refactoring work, you need to add a lot more.\n\nHere's a structure I use:\n\n    ## Build Commands\n    - python manage.py test apps.billing.tests: Run billing tests\n    - python manage.py test --parallel: Run full test suite\n    - flake8 apps/: Run linter\n    \n    ## Architecture Overview\n    Django monolith, ~50k LOC. Core modules: billing, auth, inventory, notifications.\n    Billing and auth are tightly coupled (legacy decision). Inventory is relatively isolated.\n    Database: PostgreSQL. Cache: Redis. Task queue: Celery.\n    \n    ## Refactoring Guidelines\n    - IMPORTANT: Always run relevant tests after any code changes\n    - Prefer incremental changes over large rewrites\n    - When extracting methods, preserve original function signatures as wrappers initially\n    - Document any behavior changes in commit messages\n    \n    ## Hard Rules\n    - DO NOT modify files in apps/auth/core without explicit approval\n    - DO NOT change any database migration files\n    - DO NOT modify the BaseModel class in apps/common/models.py\n    - Always run tests before reporting a task as complete\n\n  \nThat 'Hard Rules' section is non-negotiable for legacy work. \n\nEvery codebase has load-bearing walls, code that looks ugly but is handling some critical edge case nobody fully understands anymore. \n\nI explicitly tell Claude which modules are off-limits unless I specifically ask.\n\nOne thing I learned the hard way: CLAUDE .md files cascade hierarchically. \n\nIf you have `root/CLAUDE.md` and `apps/billing/CLAUDE.md`, both get loaded when Claude touches billing code. I use this to add module-specific context. The billing CLAUDE. md has details about proration edge cases that don't matter elsewhere.\n\n**Step 3: Incremental Refactoring With Continuous Verification**\n\nHere's where the actual refactoring happens but the keyword is *incremental*.\n\nI break refactoring into small, specific tasks. \n\n>'Extract the discount calculation logic from Invoice.process() into a separate method.' \"Rename all instances of 'usr' to 'user' in the auth module.\" \"Remove the deprecated payment\\_v1 endpoint and all code paths that reference it.\"\n\nEach task gets its own prompt. After each change, Claude runs the characterization tests. If they pass, we commit and move on. If they fail, we debug before touching anything else.\n\n>The prompt I use: \"Implement this refactoring step: \\[specific task\\]. After making changes, run pytest tests/\\[relevant\\_test\\_file\\].py and confirm all tests pass. If any fail, debug and fix before reporting completion.\"\n\nThis feels tedious but it's way faster than letting Claude do a big-bang refactor and spending two days figuring out which of 47 changes broke something.\n\n  \n**Step 4: CodeRabbit Catches What I Miss**\n\nEven with tests passing, there's stuff you miss. \n\n* Security issues. \n* Performance antipatterns. \n* Subtle logic errors that don't show up in your test cases.\n\nI run CodeRabbit on every PR before merging. \n\n>It's an AI code review tool that runs 40+ analyzers and catches things that generic linters miss… race conditions, memory leaks, places where Claude hallucinated an API that doesn't exist.\n\nThe workflow: Claude finishes a refactoring chunk, I commit and push, CodeRabbit reviews, I fix whatever it flags, push again and repeat until the review comes back clean.\n\nOn one PR, CodeRabbit caught that Claude had introduced a SQL injection vulnerability while 'cleaning up' a db query.\n\n  \n**Where This Breaks Down**\n\nI'm not going to pretend this is foolproof.\n\nContext limits are real. \n\n* Claude Code has a 200k token limit but performance degrades well before that. I try to stay under 25-30k tokens per session. \n* For big refactors, I use handoff documents… markdown files that summarize progress, decisions made and next steps so I can start fresh sessions without losing context.\n* Hallucinated APIs still happen. Claude will sometimes use methods that don't exist, either from external libraries or your own codebase. The characterization tests catch most of this but not all.\n* Complex architectural decisions are still on you. \n* Claude can execute a refactoring plan beautifully. It can't tell you whether that plan makes sense for where your codebase is headed. That judgment is still human work.\n\n**My verdict**\n\nRefactoring 50k lines in 3 weeks instead of 3 months is possible but only if you treat Claude Code as a powerful tool that needs guardrails not an autonomous refactoring agent.\n\n* Write characterization tests before you touch anything\n* Set up your CLAUDE .md with explicit boundaries and hard rules\n* Refactor incrementally with continuous test verification\n* Use CodeRabbit or similar ai code review tools to catch what tests miss\n* And review every change yourself before it goes to prod.\n\nAnd that's about all I can think of for now. \n\nLike I said, I'm just another dev and I would love to hear tips and tricks from everybody else, as well as any criticisms because I'm always up for improving upon my workflow. \n\nIf you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read.",

It will bring bugs, and you prompting to solve bugs with bring more bugs.\n\nEven if you try to refactor things step by step, the context starts fading after 4-5 prompts. I've tried it, doesnt work trust me.\n\nMy approach was using **spec driven development** approach to deal with it. I used [Traycer](https://traycer.ai/)'s epic mode to generate specs for my existing code. They had a dedicated code refactoring workflow, which is supposed to deal with things like this.\n\nI get my specs made, it broke the task into tickets. each ticket was a small task. I manually checked them. If the task was easy, I mean if i felt it could be done by claude, I directly handed it off. Otherwise, I broke it down further into phases, then each phase was a sub-task, make it even more simpler.\n\n*Note: While I'm doing all this, I don't need to worry about the context window because the claude will be referring these specs at every chat. So it actually made progress with every task, and not break things of step 1 when I reach step 4.*\n\nYou'd need to overlook this process all the time. Don't let even a single line of slop enter your code, or you'd spend hours (or even days) finding what went wrong.\n\nAs you've mentioned, [CodeRabbit](https://www.coderabbit.ai/) will help you out with reviewing and cutting out the incorrect code. Get it reviewed at every stage and fix them immediately so further steps can go in the right direction.",

      "text": "I’ve seen the same pattern a bunch of you are posting about: **Opus feels… off,** more “confident wrong,” edits that drift, missed constraints, and it takes extra cycles to land a clean change.\n\nI’m not here to litigate *why* (infra bugs, routing, whatever). I just want to share a workflow that made my day-to-day coding feel reliable again. it works great for me with most good models like sonnet or opus.\n\nThis is the loop:\n\n**1) Specs** → **2) Tickets** → **3) Execution** → **4) Verification** → back to (3) until all good.\n\nI’ll break it down with the exact prompts / structure.\n\n# 0) Ground rules (the whole thing depends on this)\n\n* **Single source of truth:** a collection of specs (e.g. specs/ with one file per feature) that never gets “hand-wavy.”\n* **Execution:** it doesn’t rewrite the spec, just works on tickets.\n* **Verification:** Check the diff based on the ticket context.\n\n**If you skip any of these, you’re back to vibe-coding.**\n\n# 1) Specs (make the model do the thinking once)\n\nGoal: turn “what I want” into something **testable and reviewable**.\n\n**My spec template:**\n\n* Non-goals (explicit)\n* User stories (bullets)\n* Acceptance criteria (checkboxes)\n* Edge cases (bullets)\n* API / data model changes (if any)\n* Observability (logs/metrics)\n* Rollout plan / risk\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nYou are my staff engineer. Draft a spec for the feature below using the template. Ask up to 5 clarifying questions first. Then produce a spec that is measurable (acceptance criteria) and includes edge cases + non-goals.\n\nThen I answer the 5 questions and re-run once.\n\n**Key move:** I treat the spec like code. If it’s vague, it’s wrong.\n\n# 2) Tickets (convert spec → executable slices)\n\nGoal: **no ticket ambiguity**, no “do everything” tasks.\n\n**Ticket format I use:**\n\n* Title\n* Context (link to spec section)\n* Scope (what changes)\n* Out of scope\n* Implementation notes (optional)\n* Acceptance checks (commands + expected behavior)\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nConvert this spec into 5–12 engineering tickets. Each ticket must be independently mergeable. Keep tickets small (1–3 files typically). For each ticket: include acceptance checks (commands + what to verify).\n\nNow I have a ticket list I can run like a conveyor belt.\n\n# 3) Execution (ticket-in, patch-out)\n\nGoal: **Claude Code does focused changes with guardrails**.\n\nI paste ONE ticket at a time.\n\n**Prompt (Claude Code):**\n\nImplement Ticket #3 exactly. Constraints:\n\n\\- Do not change behavior outside the ticket scope.\n\n\\- If you need to touch more than 5 files, stop and propose a split.\n\n\\- Keep diffs minimal.\n\nIf it starts drifting, I don’t argue and just stop it and re-anchor:\n\nYou’re going out of scope. Re-read the ticket. Propose the smallest diff that satisfies the acceptance checks.\n\n# 4) Verification loop (don’t trust the model’s “done” signal)\n\nGoal: **the model doesn’t get to decide it’s done.**\n\nAt this stage, I want something boring and external:\n\n* run the checks (tests / lint / typecheck)\n* show exactly what failed\n* confirm acceptance criteria line‑by‑line\n* flag mismatches vs the spec or ticket\n\nThen I feed *only* the failures back into Claude Code:\n\nHere are the failing checks + error output. Fix only what’s needed to make them pass, staying within Ticket #3.\n\nRepeat until:\n\n* checks are green\n* acceptance criteria is visibly satisfied\n\n# Automating the boring parts\n\nOnce you adopt this loop, the real issue isn’t thinking about the feature . it’s **maintaining discipline**:\n\n* asking the right clarifying questions every time\n* keeping long-lived context across a *collection of specs*\n* making sure each execution starts clean\n* verifying work instead of trusting a model’s “done” signal\n\nThis is the part that’s easy to skip when you’re tired or moving fast.\n\nI tried using traycers epic mode (specs tickets) feature for this (but its TOTALLY **OPTIONAL,** it works for me) -\n\n(may or may not work for you):\n\n* **Asks thorough, structured questions up front** before a spec or ticket runs (missing constraints, edge cases, scope gaps)\n* **Manages context explicitly** across your spec collection so the right background is loaded and irrelevant context stays out\n* **Launches a fresh Claude Code execution per ticket**, so each change starts from a clean state\n* **Runs verification at every step** \\- it compares the ticket with diff i think\n* **Closes the loop automatically** by feeding only failures back into execution until it’s actually green\n\nYou still decide what to build and what “correct” means.\n\nIt just removes the need to babysit context, prompts, and verification - so the workflow stays boring, repeatable, and reliable.\n\n\\--\n\nEDIT: Fixed the prompts, it didnt paste with quotes. my bad",

          "text": "This feels like a good reminder that LLMs are closer to junior engineers than magic tools. If the problem is well specified and the feedback loop is strict, the output is usually fine. When either of those is loose, things fall apart quickly.\n\n\r\nWhat’s useful about this workflow is that it pushes more effort into upfront clarity and external verification, instead of relying on the model to self-correct. That makes the overall system much more stable, especially as model behavior changes over time. You’re not betting on the model being “smart enough”, you’re constraining it so that even average runs produce acceptable results.",
