At this point, they're doing it in a legal way (scanning and destruction of the book). The real concern at this point is the difference of environment that the AI is contained in. American models have plenty of issues surrounding them. One of the main ones is safety.\n\n\nIdk about you, but safety isnt the first thing that comes to mind when I think of China. Maybe thats me just watching one too many Liveleak videos. The other issue is government. Yes, the American models/labs have their own problems with that, but I see the US as the lesser of two evils (Ill be honest in saying its not by a wide margin).\n\n\nAGI/ASI will eventually fix these problems one way or another (e.g. its not a problem if you no longer exist), but the bridge between now and then may be the most precarious position humanity will ever be in. Racing the CCP on AI development is not something we should want to do while crossing that bridge.\n\n\nIf AI development was devoid of government influence and everyone had the same or better safety standards? Id say the more the merrier. \n\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk...",

CLAUDE.MD — Project Memory\n*   **What**: A markdown file Claude reads every session. Your project's \"brain dump\" — coding style, architecture, common commands, conventions.\n*   **Where**: `./claude.md` (project) or `~/.claude/claude.md` (global)\n*   **Create**: Run `/init` in your project — Claude generates it for you\n\n### 2. Custom Slash Commands\n*   **What**: Your own `/commands`. Markdown files with prompts that YOU invoke. Like prompt templates.\n*   **Where**: `.claude/commands/` (project) or `~/.claude/commands/` (global)\n*   **Use**: Filename = command name. `review.md` -> type `/project:review`\n\n### 3. Skills — Auto-invoked Knowledge\n*   **What**: Like commands, but Claude decides when to use them automatically. You DON'T invoke them — Claude detects when they're relevant.\n*   **Where**: `.claude/skills/` with a `skill.md` inside each skill folder\n*   **Use**: Just work on your project — Claude picks up relevant skills from context\n\n### 4. Sub-Agents — Specialized Helpers\n*   **What**: Separate Claude instances with their own context & role. Like team members: reviewer, debugger, architect, etc.\n*   **Where**: `.claude/agents/` (markdown files with YAML metadata)\n*   **Invoke**: `/agents` to manage, or say \"Use the reviewer agent\"\n*   **CLI**: `--agent my-agent` or `--agents '{\"json\"}'`\n\n### 5. MCP Servers — External Tool Connections\n*   **What**: Connect Claude to external tools: GitHub, Notion, databases, APIs, browsers, etc.\n*   **Setup**: `claude mcp add <name> <command>`\n*   **List**: `claude mcp list`\n*   **Config**: `--mcp-config ./mcp.json` at launch\n\n### Plugins — Community Extensions\n*   **What**: Bundles of commands, skills, hooks & more from the community\n*   **Browse**: `/plugin` to browse, install, enable, disable\n*   **Dir**: `--plugin-dir ./my-plugins` for local plugins\n\n**How they differ:**\n*   **Custom Commands** -> **YOU** invoke them\n*   **Skills** -> **CLAUDE** invokes them\n*   **Sub-Agents** -> **Separate AI instances**\n*   **MCP** -> **External tool connections**\n\n---\n\n## 🛡️ Permission Modes\n\n*   **Normal**: Claude asks permission for every tool use (read, write, bash, etc.)\n*   **Auto-Accept**: Claude runs tools WITHOUT asking. Faster but less control. Good for trusted tasks.\n*   **Plan Mode**: Claude ONLY reads & plans. Won't write or run anything. Review first, then switch to Normal to execute.\n\n**Shift+Tab** -> Normal -> Auto-Accept -> Plan\n\n> 💡 **Best workflow:** Start in Plan Mode to explore & understand the problem. Review Claude’s plan. Switch to Normal/Auto-Accept to implement. This is what you already do — it’s the right approach!\n\n---\n\n## ⚓ Hooks — Event Automation\n\n*   **PreToolUse**: Runs BEFORE Claude uses a tool — validate, block, or modify\n*   **PostToolUse**: Runs AFTER a tool — check results, auto-format, lint\n*   **UserPromptSubmit**: Before your message is processed\n*   **Stop**: When Claude finishes its response\n*   **SessionStart**: When a session begins\n*   **SessionEnd**: When a session ends\n*   **PreCompact**: Before context compression\n*   **Notification**: When Claude sends a notification\n\n> 💡 **Example:** Auto-run prettier after every file edit, or block writes to `.env` files. Configure in your settings JSON.\n\n---\n\n## ✨ Input Superpowers\n\n*   **`@ mention`**: Type `@` to reference files & folders. Claude reads them into context.\n*   **`! prefix`**: Type `!` to run shell commands inline. E.g., `! git status`\n*   **Paste images**: Ctrl+V to paste screenshots, diagrams, error images directly\n*   **Pipe input**: `cat file.py | claude -p \"explain\"` — feed data directly\n*   **Multi-dir**: `claude --add-dir ../api ../web` — work across multiple projects\n*   **Worktrees**: `claude -w feature` — isolated git branch + Claude session\n\n> ⚠️ **Pro Tip:** Use @ references instead of copy-pasting file contents. It’s smarter with context and uses fewer tokens.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Configuration\n\n### SETTINGS PRIORITY (HIGHEST → LOWEST)\n1.  **Enterprise**: `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json`\n2.  **Project Local**: `.claude/settings.local.json` (your personal project settings)\n3.  **Project Shared**: `.claude/settings.json` (committed to git, shared with team)\n4.  **User Global**: `~/.claude/settings.json` (your defaults)\n\n### CONFIG CLI\n*   **`config list`**: `claude config list` — show all settings\n*   **`config get`**: `claude config get key` — check a value\n*   **`config set`**: `claude config set key value` — change a value\n*   **`config add`**: `claude config add key value` — add to array\n\n> 💡 **Permissions example:** Allow git commands without asking: add `\"bash(git:*)\"` to your allowedTools in settings.\n\n---\n\n## 📂 File Structure Map\n\n### PROJECT LEVEL (.CLAUDE/)\n*   **`CLAUDE.md`**: Project memory — conventions, architecture, commands\n*   **`settings.json`**: Shared project settings (committed to git)\n*   **`settings.local.json`**: Your personal settings (gitignore'd)\n*   **`commands/`**: Project slash commands (`*.md` files)\n*   **`skills/`**: Project skills (folders with `skill.md`)\n*   **`agents/`**: Project sub-agents (`*.md` files)\n\n### GLOBAL LEVEL (~/.CLAUDE/)\n*   **`CLAUDE.md`**: Global memory (applies to ALL projects)\n*   **`settings.json`**: Global settings\n*   **`commands/`**: Personal global commands\n*   **`skills/`**: Personal global skills\n*   **`keybindings.json`**: Custom keyboard shortcuts\n\n---\n\n## ⏪ Rewind & Checkpoints\n\n*   **Esc Esc**: Open rewind menu anywhere\n*   **`/rewind`**: Same but typed as command\n\n### REWIND OPTIONS\n*   **Conversation**: Go back in chat only. Code stays as-is.\n*   **Code**: Restore files only. Conversation stays.\n*   **Full Rewind**: Restore both conversation AND code to a point.\n\n> ⚠️ **Note:** Bash side-effects (database changes, API calls, deleted files via rm) can't be rewound. Checkpoints only track file edits by Claude. Use Git for permanent safety.",

Saves tokens dramatically.\n*   **Use /clear:** Between unrelated tasks. Don't carry irrelevant context.\n*   **Use Sonnet:** For routine tasks. Save Opus for complex architecture decisions.\n*   **Use @ refs:** Instead of pasting code — smarter context management.\n\n### DEBUGGING LIKE A PRO\n*   **Paste errors**: Copy-paste the full error message. Claude parses stack traces brilliantly.\n*   **Paste screenshots**: Ctrl+V a screenshot of the bug. Claude sees it.\n*   **Pipe logs**: `cat error.log | claude -p \"what's wrong?\"`\n*   **`/doctor`**: If something feels broken, run this first.\n\n### PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT (PRO)\n*   **Worktrees**: `claude -w feature-auth` — isolated branch + session\n*   **Multiple dirs**: `--add-dir ../api ../web` — work across repos\n*   **Background**: Ctrl+B sends a task to background so you can start another\n*   **Agent Teams**: Multiple Claude instances collaborating (experimental) **NEW**\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Create Custom Commands\n\n1.  **Create file**: `.claude/commands/review.md`\n2.  **Write prompt**: The markdown content IS the prompt Claude will use\n3.  **Use it**: Type `/project:review` in Claude Code\n\n### OPTIONAL YAML FRONTMATTER\n*   **`argument-hint`**: Placeholder text for argument input\n*   **`description`**: Shows in `/help` listing\n*   **`allowed-tools`**: Restrict what tools the command can use\n*   **`model`**: Force a specific model for this command\n\n### VARIABLE: $ARGUMENTS\n*   **`$ARGUMENTS`**: Use `$ARGUMENTS` in your markdown — it gets replaced with whatever you type after the command\n\n> 💡 **Example:** `/project:review src/auth.ts` -> `$ARGUMENTS` = `\"src/auth.ts\"`\n\n---\n\n## 🗒️ Quick Reference — Most Used Combos\n\n### DAILY ESSENTIALS\n*   **Start project**: `cd project && claude`\n*   **Continue where I left off**: `claude -c`\n*   **Quick question, no session**: `claude -p \"how do I...\"`\n*   **Review my changes**: `git diff | claude -p \"review\"`\n*   **Explain error**: `cat error.log | claude -p \"explain\"`\n*   **Check cost**: Type `/cost` anytime\n*   **Undo mistake**: `Esc Esc -> Rewind`\n\n### POWER MOVES\n*   **Parallel sessions**: `claude -w feature-a` + `claude -w feature-b`\n*   **Custom reviewer agent**: `Create .claude/agents/reviewer.md`\n*   **Auto-format on edit**: `PostToolUse hook -> run prettier`\n*   **Web session**: `claude --remote \"fix the bug\"`\n*   **Transfer to local**: `claude --teleport`\n*   **Budget limit**: `claude -p --max-budget-usd 2 \"query\"`\n*   **Scripted automation**: `claude -p --output-format json \"query\" | jq`",

Discouraging brittle tests means it will prefer to use more flexible definitions like “COUNTA(category_label)” instead. \n\nIt’s no magic cure, but it helps a _lot_.

After 2 dozen prompts Claude was raving that my code was the best it has ever seen?  I was doing this all through happy on my phone from an airport while waiting for a 4 hour delay so I haven't actually looked at the code myself or tried running it yet, but it was calling out things to improve and stabilize, with possible bugs it patched and all the best practices and reviewing the 700 test cases across the project and adding a couple more where it thought some edge cases might be.  I am hoping when I open the project back up I don't have to revert those git commits because it made a lovely polished ball of dung out of my working project.",

The JSONL watching has its issues though as I mentioned, but I think its key that it hooks directly to what’s already available. As for the filename they are working on, sometimes it shows it in the agent status like above the character’s head.

It told me it was a bad practice to use union in this case, and I should use a select from values trick.

On one hand you have the people that claim they feed it a document and let Claude code run hours and days on end to build something without any human interaction at all.  I simply find this hard to believe and maybe what you're experiencing. On the other hand I find that if I give it small discreet tasks it is very good at executing on those and saves me hours and days if not weeks and months that I would have spent on coding that same thing. So while it's highly interactive and iterative in my view it's still much more productive than a human writing the same code.  It is also highly effective at debugging. Feed it an error message and boom nine times out of 10 it solves it within seconds. That would have taken a human hours to fix.",

Vim macro doesn't do that. I do one line, end recording, hit 15@a to execute the macro 15 times, done. Always correct. \n\nI either use the inline chat, it the ask mode.

My experience is that it's similar to GPT/Gemini, likely somewhat better output, but the main difference is that the workflow is much smoother since it just edits the files on my computer which saves me a lot of time. Still, it does really dumb shit pretty often. A few of my examples from this week:  \n1. I wanted it to add some output files cleanup to a Python script. Instead of reach run of the script just cleaning up what it created, it wrote it so each run tries to cleanup everything from every run. Instead of going over 100 directories, every run was going over 100,000 directories.   \n2. It didn't know what was available in a specific python library, so it just decided to try and use it as if it's a different library (which is used for similar things).  \n3. I told it that the color it was using for a figure was problematic because it was too bright. So, it flipped it so denser regions were now light instead of dark, which both doesn't solve the problem and is just confusing because the standard is that dense==dark. It only fixed the problem when I told it to clip the brightness.  \n4. It failed to count to 3 once, overshot with 4 (it didn't affect anything, but was kinda funny).\n\nStill, with all of this, when giving it detailed explanations of what I want it's often quite good and speeds up my work by a whole lot.",

FOMO and burnout set in, causing developers to work longer and harder. Output inflation replaces any leverage. You know you have this immensely powerful new weapon at your disposal, a tool that just a few years ago could have enabled you beat all your competition. But something is off. You realize that every second it is not working for you, it is working for someone else against you. It's a dobule-edged sword that cuts both ways, without a handle.  \n  \nQuantity and complexity are on the rise, while clarity and quality are falling behind. Cognitive load shifts and increases in all sorts of ways by trying to keep up and communicate with the machines. AI coding tools are putting more work on everyone's plates, not less.  \n  \nMeanwhile executives, clients, and customers extrapolate unrealistic gains in speed and scope, based on flawed assumptions about the reality of AI's capabilities and dynamics. The result is much higher pressure on developers to ship more faster, while technical debt, maintenance & engineering costs\\* are rising rapidly, causing downstream failure modes and code red situations, and sleepless nights.\n\nA pattern I observe across many clients is that where in the past you could build a simple app and do well, you now have to build something of the complexity of eBay to do okay. The problem-solution space is saturating exponentially faster, which means that the time window between problem-discovery and solution is narrowing rapidly, with hundreds to tens of thousands of developers converging on the same ideas simultaneously in a big scramble for diminishing returns.\n\n\\* Side note: Companies who are firing people due to AI automation simply lack vision.

Sure, there might be less investments as a result, but the fruits of those investments never go to working people anyway. That’s why America, despite being the richest country, still has the highest poverty rate of all developed countries. \n\nBut Americans sure love to cuck themselves to their corporate overlords.

You end up with an agent of a roughly static context size. If you are clever about batch inference and which KV caches you swap when, the illusion of continuity is maintained.",

Local and interactive or non-interacrive vs remote interactive / non-interactice.\n\nAn agent either 1) advises you 2) collaborates with you 3) works autonomously and asks for your review  and 4) works by itself and feedback loops.\n\nSo you might say, \"I'm working local, interactive in mode 2. I'm collaborating with AI, it's doing work, I'm steering\"\n\nIf you asked a non tech person what an agent is, their thinking would be more mode 3 or 4, and probably remote. \"A machine somewhere acting independently\"",

If you’re talking about a personal level or a small business then probably not.

When the open weight models are good enough for Senior Engineer level work, that should cover most people and most projects. They're also much cheaper to use.\n\nFurthermore, it is feasible to host the open weight models locally. You'd need a bit of technical know-how and expensive hardware, but you could feasibly do that now. Imagine having an Opus quality model at your fingertips, for free, with no rate limits.

Obvious things to consider before doing this include:\n\n- what happens when Anthropic/your internet goes down?\n- how do you recover from a catastrophic loss?\n- how do you make sure Claude doesn't go AWOL with that SSH key?\n- what's the worst thing that happen if/when it does?\n\nand so on. Principle of Least Privilege and strong documentation are among your allies here. Also, if you can't answer yes to the question: \"could I clearly describe to a competent human engineer what I am about to agree to let Claude do?\", you should strongly consider filling that knowledge gap before letting it do its thing.

As the models get more powerful, that Mac Studio depreciates and likely won't be able to run local models that match Opus 6 (or whatever) so it's dead money the same as the monthly subscriptions. Furthermore, all the time saved from just plug and play, auto updates, a whole team of world class engineers maintaining the services...  I just don't see why I'd switch.

Without it, the pure LLM can't do anything. It can't even read files. It's like a ChatGPT when it first came out, just a bit smarter maybe.\n\nWhat you're talking about is not having to use the Claude models. Which might be true. While Claude Code is tailored towards Claude models, there are ways to use it with Kimi, MinMax, GLM, even GPT models. In my experience they're not as good because of that tailoring towards Claude. You also need to use token-based pricing in this case.\n\nAs for running your own models, you'd have to spend thousands to just be able to run them. You either need a dedicated device with upwards of 100GB of RAM and a lot of GPU processing power like a Mac Mini/Studio with an Ultra/Max chip, or a really beefy graphics card with tons of RAM. \\[Hardward requirements for GLM 5\\](https://onedollarvps.com/blogs/how-to-run-GLM-5-locally.html#hardware-requirements) are nuts. Minimal is 4x NVIDIA A100 which is \\~10-17k USD. And even with all that hardware you'd get a lot lower TPS (tokens-per-second) compared to using hosted inference. And we're not even talking about other hardware, maintenance of the infrastructure, ability to access it remotely, upgrading fairly often, etc. This only makes sense for big companies with massive security requirements.\n\nAs far as I can tell the math just doesn't work out. So Claude Code or a similar harness like OpenCode or Code will be needed and you'll need to pay for something - tokens, subscriptions, something...",

That's where open-weight models start drifting from instructions, ignoring constraints they followed fine for the first hour, and confidently doing the wrong thing.\n\nBehavioral consistency across a long agent run is a fundamentally different property from benchmark performance. The benchmarks capture average quality. Production multi-agent stacks care about tail behavior.\n\nThat gap will close too.

Better able to hire and retain top tier talent that shares Anthropic's concerns about mass surveillance and autonomous weapons (as most of the top AI talent actually do).  Also a potential inverse Streisand Effect where the more Trump rants about Anthropic, the more positive exposure they get.  This could put them on par with OpenAI for name recognition among the general public.  Positive among liberals, negative among MAGA, but all press is good press.",

Instead, it's an abstract starburst or pinwheel that symbolizes the generation and outward flow of ideas.  \n\n• Human Warmth Meets Technical Precision: The logo uses circular shapes to embody \"the fluidity and warmth of human-centered thinking,\" while the right angles are meant to introduce \"the precision and structure that technology demands.\"\n\n• Trust and Approachability: Unlike the hyper-futuristic or flashy branding of some other AI tools, Claude’s minimalist design and muted colors are intentionally chosen to project a sense of calm, transparency, and safety. This aligns perfectly with Anthropic's core mission of building \"helpful, honest, and harmless\" AI.",

These include specialized tools for unit testing, markdown generation, workflow development, project-specific brain storming, design, & plan, session journaling, and task management. To optimize efficiency, I told Claude to implement a local caching system for web requests that prevents redundant API calls and saves tokens. These get stored in a <project>/.claude/.cache/ folder.\n\nClaude feels significantly more powerful with this setup. Because these skills function like a precise employee training manual, there is less guesswork and a noticeable increase in output quality.\n\nFor example, if I want a list in alphabetical order, and I'm adding an entry to a list, it will automatically edit the file and insert the item into the list in the correct spot, whereas before, I had to remember to tell it to do so, or correct it after the fact. Claude even improves itself, by updating existing or creating new skills, based on my patterns. It constantly evolves.\n\nI prefer direct interaction over automated background agents, so integrating these skills has fundamentally improved my development workflow. I would say I've saved about an hour each day correcting things.",

It then can create a new skill based on that frequency, or remove a skill if it hasn't been used, also based on frequency. \n\nSo if a skill is used once monthly, it won't delete it after 30 days, it may wait 6 months, but a skill that's used daily or weekly, will get removed after 30 or 60 days. A new skill can be created the same day if it finds a pattern used more than 3 times in the same day, or once daily for 7 days. (or it updates existing skills)",

The principle is identical across tools — constraint-based config files that persist across sessions.\n\n**The pattern that works everywhere:**\n\n1. **Guardrails first.** The single most impactful skill/rule you can write for any tool is \"don't touch files I didn't mention.\" Sounds obvious, but without it, both Claude Code and Cursor will wander into unrelated files and break things.\n\n2. **Negative rules > positive rules.** OP nailed this. \"Never do X\" is more reliable than \"always do Y\" because AI agents are better at avoidance than remembrance. A short list of hard constraints beats a long list of preferences.\n\n3. **Project context is the force multiplier.** A single file explaining your stack, folder structure, and naming conventions saves more tokens than any other optimization. Every new session without it wastes the first 2-3 exchanges just establishing context.\n\n4. **Skills/rules are portable across tools.** A well-written guardrails skill for Claude Code translates almost 1:1 to a .cursor/rules/*.mdc file with `alwaysApply: true`. The mental model is the same — you're writing onboarding docs for an AI coworker who has amnesia every session.\n\nThe evolve-yourself skill idea is clever. We've been doing something similar — tracking which rules actually prevent errors vs which ones Claude ignores, then pruning the ignored ones. Smaller, tighter rule sets work better than comprehensive ones.",

The structure of 'decision, context, options considered, consequences' maps perfectly to what agents should be documenting.\n\n  \nThe gap I see is that ADRs are traditionally human-authored. An engineer makes a decision, then writes up the reasoning. But when an agent is making dozens of micro-decisions per session — which ORM to use, how to structure the migration, whether to refactor existing code or work around it — nobody's writing those up.\n\n  \nThe interesting question is whether you can get agents to auto-generate ADR-style docs as part of their task completion. Not the big architectural calls (those still need a human), but the implementation-level decisions that are currently invisible. 'I chose approach X over Y because Z' as a structured output, not buried in a chat log.\n\n  \nHas anyone tried building that into their skills? Something like a mandatory 'document your decisions' step at the end of every task?",

      "text": "We're a small team (Codeflash — we build a Python code optimization tool) and we've been using Claude Code heavily for feature development. It's been genuinely great for productivity.\n\nRecently we shipped two big features — Java language support (\\~52K lines) and React framework support (\\~24K lines) — both built primarily with Claude Code. The features worked. Tests passed. We were happy.\n\nThen we ran our own tool on the PRs.\n\n**The results:**\n\nAcross just these two PRs ([\\#1199](https://github.com/codeflash-ai/codeflash/pull/1199) and [\\#1561](https://github.com/codeflash-ai/codeflash/pull/1561)), we found **118 functions** that were performing significantly worse than they needed to. You can see the Codeflash bot comments on both PRs — there are a lot of them.\n\n**What the slow code actually looked like:**\n\nThe patterns were really consistent. Here's a concrete example — Claude Code wrote this to convert byte offsets to character positions:\n\n     \n    # Called for every AST node in the file\n    start_char = len(content_bytes[:start_byte].decode(\"utf8\"))\n    end_char = len(content_bytes[:end_byte].decode(\"utf8\"))\n\nIt re-decodes the entire byte prefix from scratch on every single call. O(n) per lookup, called hundreds of times per file. The fix was to build a cumulative byte table once and binary search it — **19x faster** for the exact same result. ([PR #1597](https://github.com/codeflash-ai/codeflash/pull/1597))\n\nOther patterns we saw over and over:\n\n* **Naive algorithms** where efficient ones exist — a [type extraction function](https://github.com/codeflash-ai/codeflash/pull/1583) was **446x slower** because it used string scanning instead of tree-sitter\n* **Redundant computation** — an [import inserter](https://github.com/codeflash-ai/codeflash/pull/1588) was **36x slower** from redundant tree traversals\n* **Zero caching** — a [type extractor](https://github.com/codeflash-ai/codeflash/pull/1608) was **16x slower** because it recomputed everything from scratch on repeated calls\n* **Wrong data structures** — a [brace-balancing parser](https://github.com/codeflash-ai/codeflash/pull/1630) was **3x slower** from using lists where sets would work\n\nAll of these were correct code. All passed tests. None would have been caught in a normal code review. That's what makes it tricky.\n\n**Why this happens (our take):**\n\nThis isn't a Claude Code-specific issue — it's structural to how LLMs generate code:\n\n1. LLMs optimize for correctness, not performance. The simplest correct solution is what you get.\n2. Optimization is an exploration problem. You can't tell code is slow by reading it — you have to benchmark it, try alternatives, measure again. LLMs do single-pass generation.\n3. Nobody prompts for performance. When you say \"add Java support,\" the implicit target is working code, fast. Not optimally-performing code.\n4. Performance problems are invisible. No failing test, no error, no red flag. The cost shows up in your cloud bill months later.\n\nThe [SWE-fficiency benchmark](https://swefficiency.com/) tested 11 frontier LLMs like Claude 4.6 Opus on real optimization tasks — the best achieved less than 0.23x the speedup of human experts. Better models aren't closing this gap because the problem isn't model intelligence, it's the mismatch between single-pass generation and iterative optimization.\n\n**Not bashing Claude Code.** We use it daily and it's incredible for productivity. But we think people should be aware of this tradeoff. The code ships fast, but it runs slow — and nobody notices until it's in production.\n\nFull writeup with all the details and more PR links: [BLOG LINK](https://www.codeflash.ai/blog-posts/hidden-cost-of-coding-agents)\n\nCurious if anyone else has noticed this with their Claude Code output. Have you ever benchmarked the code it generates?",

It consistently will duplicate code and you're throwing darts blind if you ask it to 'abstract out common patterns' without direct, explicit instructions.\n\nI think one of the most egregious things I've noticed is that in gamedev projects CC will always opt to loop over arrays rather than using maps where applicable. I'm talking so many instances of n or nlogn instead of just O(1) implementations.\n\nI really like using these tools and they get me started on proof of concepts quicker than I ever have in my entire career, but it's also like pulling teeth sometimes and often after the PoC I'm just weighing every prompt with 'should I do it or prompt Claude four times to maybe get it done?'",

Called per AST node it's O(n²) and the model has no way to know that from the local scope it sees during generation.\n\nI've seen the same thing building code analysis tooling. The model will happily generate a tree traversal helper, then call it inside another tree traversal, giving you O(n²) or worse without any single function looking wrong in isolation. Code review catches it maybe 30% of the time because each function reads clean.\n\nThe real fix isn't post-hoc profiling, it's treating AI-generated code the same way you'd treat a junior's PR: assume the hot path is wrong until profiled. 118 out of 76K lines of code is honestly a lower hit rate than I'd expect.",

Without that gate, you collect a debt of 'good enough' implementations that compound into performance problems at exactly the wrong time.\n\nCurious what the optimized versions looked like — was it mostly algorithmic choices, data structure selection, or something more subtle like unnecessary allocations?",

This assigns a performance tuner to do a review and optimization as a default assumption. It works. There is just a natural need to think of the model like you would think of a junior or mid level developer--they are going to need to have code reviews, have reinforcement of which patterns to use, etc. You can either throw your hands up or bake that into your harness for the models you work with. If you bake it in, it works well. It works especially well if you treat the effort like a traditional sprint and do retrospectives where you ask these agent profiles to weigh in on what was done well vs. could have been done better-they will help steer you in the right direction and help keep drift under control.",

This is a dream.\n\nWhen I read others losing their jobs my job is just getting better from upgrading my skills so fast my company doesnt even have a clue what are these stuff, tho they implement AI influencers for marketing and AI website translation, Automatic AI support translation, etc, but they don't know example how they could connect Opus to Jira and create excels and extremely deep analysis about the workflows, bottlenecks, automatic analytics reports with AI analysis, etc.\n\nI had to ask and prove a lot that Claude is the best and we should buy the max plan, and after they bought it everyone started using it in the company.\n\nI literally got up a tons in the career ladder just using AI nonstop for everything in marketing, webdevelopment. But if you focus on one thing and gain knowledge in one domain, you can still switch later to another and use the knowledge you already have to learn faster. Just follow what makes you excited and you will keep up all night to do it and easily memorize everything and innovate because you love it.\n\n",

He doesn't know practically any of the words mentioned in the image... he has simply always made products in PHP for e-commerce.\n\nToday he does everything with Claude Code / GH Copilot... AND THAT'S IT.\n\nSame output, same customers, same stack, no changes whatsoever... he simply works 1/5 of the time, earns the same overall, but more if we consider the hours worked.\n\nIt's true vibe coding, of course, backed by years of hand-written code, pre-packaged material adapted to each customer, etc., etc., awareness...\n\nI also do something very similar, even though I deal with devops/sysadmin... same operation, but instead of typing 8 lines of bash commands, I ask the AI to do it for me...\n\nThere are tens of thousands of people today who believe they are building the platform of the century, GTA8, the new Facebook in vanilla HTML CSS, etc., etc., with Claude Code... but this is a cultural problem, dictated by FOMO and internet gurus... because few people want to work and even fewer have real passion... It's just another (fake) way to hope and believe that you can become a billionaire in no time and without effort, as if all customers were rich and eager to subscribe to your platform to track the calories consumed by their dog... \n\nThis represents a huge effort even for high-level AI, but making a small backend, admin page, deploy, small debugging, UI design, frontend... for AI it's a joke... \n\nEven with free models, you can achieve amazing results and GET PAID... not millions, sometimes not even thousands... normal amounts, but real money. I paid for a vacation and my car payments with Claude Code... nothing fancy, but what used to take me 3 days now takes me 3 hours, sometimes even less.\n\nOf course, you can also have time to think about bigger projects, and that's fine... but there's no point in keeping up with all the latest developments, just find the right one and make the most of it.",

      "text": "Disclosure: I'm the developer of the tool mentioned below.\n\nBeen running Claude Code full-time on a growing TypeScript codebase. Two problems kept burning me:\n\n\n\n1. Token waste. Claude reads files linearly to build context. A single query was pulling \\~18k tokens, most of it irrelevant. On Max plan that means hitting the usage cap faster. On API it's just money on fire.\n\n2. Session amnesia. Every new session, Claude re-discovers the same architecture, re-reads the same files, asks the same questions. All the understanding from yesterday's session? Gone.\n\n\n\nSo I built a VS Code extension to fix both.\n\n**For token waste:** it builds a dependency graph from your code's AST using tree-sitter. Not embeddings, not semantic search, actual structural relationships. Who calls what, who imports what, what types flow where. When Claude asks for context, it gets a token-budgeted capsule with only the relevant subgraph. \\~2.4k tokens instead of \\~18k. Better context, fewer tokens.\n\n**For session memory:** observations from each session are linked to specific nodes in the dependency graph. What Claude explored, what it changed, what patterns it noticed. But here's the thing I didn't expect: Claude won't save its own notes even if you ask. Put \"save what you learn\" in CLAUDE.md, it cooperates maybe 10% of the time. So the extension also observes passively, it watches what Claude does, detects file changes at the AST level (not \"file modified\" but \"function signature changed, parameter added\"), and generates memory automatically. When code changes later, linked observations go stale. Next session, Claude sees \"previous context exists but code changed since, re-evaluate.\"\n\n\n\nAlso catches anti-patterns: dead-end exploration (added something then removed it same session) and file thrashing (modifying same file 4+ times in 5 minutes).\n\nAuto-generates .claude/CLAUDE.md with the full MCP tool descriptions based on your project structure. Auto-detects Claude Code via env vars.\n\nNative Rust binary under the hood, SQLite, 100% local, zero cloud, zero network calls. Works with Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Zed, Continue, and other agents too, but built Claude Code-first.\n\nIt's called **vexp** (https://vexp.dev/), free on the VS Code Marketplace.\n\n\n\nWhat's your current approach for session continuity? Curious what's working for people.",

If agent A and agent B both modify auth.ts in the same window, the correlator attributes each change to the right agent based on the tool call timing. The staleness system works at the symbol level, not the session level, so if agent B changes a function that agent A had observations about, those observations get flagged stale regardless of who made the change.\n\nWhere it gets genuinely hard is conflicting \\*decisions\\*. Agent A decides \"use JWT\" and agent B decides \"switch to session tokens\" in parallel. Right now both observations persist and the next agent sees both with timestamps. Not ideal — I don't have automatic conflict resolution yet. On the roadmap but honestly it's a hard problem.\n\nHow are you handling it in your pipeline?

Serena wraps language servers to give your agent IDE-like operations: find symbol, find references, edit at the symbol level. It's basically giving Claude the same tools a developer has in their IDE.\n\nvexp does something different: it pre-computes a full dependency graph from the AST and serves token-budgeted context capsules. So instead of the agent making 5 tool calls to navigate the code (find this symbol, now find its references, now find what calls that), it gets the relevant subgraph in one shot. Less back-and-forth, fewer tokens spent on exploration.\n\nThe other piece Serena doesn't cover is cross-session memory. vexp persists what the agent explored and learned, links it to the code graph, and auto-stales it when code changes.\n\nHonestly they solve different layers of the same problem. Serena gives agents better hands within a session, while vexp gives them a map of the codebase and a memory that carries over. You could run both.",

It doesn't rebuild from scratch. Each file change triggers an AST diff so the graph knows exactly which symbols were added, removed, renamed, or had their signature changed. Downstream edges get updated automatically.\n\nThe memory side is where it gets more interesting after a refactor. If an agent learned \"function X handles validation\" and then X gets renamed or its signature changes, that observation gets flagged stale. But if someone renames the file without changing the function bodies, the rename detection picks that up via body hash matching and the observations survive with updated references.\n\nWorst case after a truly massive refactor (like restructuring half the project), you can force a full re-index from the sidebar. Takes a few seconds on a medium codebase. Memories linked to deleted symbols get marked stale permanently but stay searchable as historical context.\n\nCurious about your setup, are your 6 agents sharing context through a common store or does each one maintain its own view?",

Sounds like you've wired together what I ended up building as a single system.\n\nCouple things vexp adds on top: the dependency graph isn't just regenerated, it's incrementally updated on every file save so there's no \"run script\" step. And the context injection is token-budgeted — it doesn't dump the whole graph, it picks the relevant subgraph for whatever the agent is working on. The passive observation piece also captures stuff your hooks might miss, like when the agent explores code without modifying anything, or when it goes down a dead end.\n\nCurious how you handle staleness, like if the dependency graph says X depends on Y but someone refactored Y since last run?",

That's the token reduction side. Second, the memory system is linked to the code graph, when code changes, observations about that code auto-stale. Cipher stores memories, but it doesn't know if the code those memories refer to has changed since.\n\nThe other difference is dependencies. Cipher needs API keys for embeddings and optionally Docker + a vector DB. vexp is a single Rust binary with SQLite, zero external dependencies, zero network calls. Nothing leaves your machine.",

Opus is right that it doesn't need a static file structure dump since it can already see your project tree.\n\nThe gaps show up in three places:\n\nFirst, relationships. Your cheatsheet has method signatures, but it doesn't tell Claude that changing validateToken breaks 4 downstream consumers in 3 different files. The dependency graph tracks those edges automatically.\n\nSecond, maintenance. Your cheatsheet is accurate the day you write it. A week later someone adds a parameter, renames a method, moves a file. Now it's silently wrong and Claude is working from stale info with no way to know. vexp rebuilds incrementally on every file save.\n\nThird, cross-session context. Your cheatsheet tells Claude what the code looks like. It doesn't tell Claude \"last Tuesday you spent 30 minutes debugging a race condition in this exact function and the fix was X.\" The memory layer captures that and surfaces it automatically, with stale flags if the code changed since.\n\nFor a small project that doesn't change much, your approach works fine. The graph and memory start earning their keep when the codebase grows, changes frequently, or you're working across multiple sessions where continuity matters.",

Works amazingly well but with bigger things, more complex codebases it definitely needs something better as it becomes really hard when you have to do bit more complex work, context gets filled up so fast, but what I hate more is when you end up with duplicates as sometimes agents decide to build their own version of alredy existing... so glad to see this problem gets addressed by more and more people, will give it I try.",

Throwing a PR into an OSS project **_after_** Anthropic announced the promotion is not going to get you those credits. They aren't dumb, they fucking built the thing you are using to do it.\n\nDownloading a repo you have never seen before, asking Claude to add 5000 lines of additional recursive type checking without even opening the repo or a project that uses it in an IDE is definitely a choice. If they even opened a project of even medium complexity with that commit they would see their IDE is basically MSFT Powerpoint.\n\nNor will adding no less than 5 SQL injection opportunities into an an opinionated ORM, while also changing every type in their path to `any` and `object`, while casting the root connection instance to any and hallucinating the new functionality they didn't even build. \n\nAt the very least, if you are going to use an LLM to generate thousands of lines of code into a useless PR, You should at least tell Claude to follow the comment guidelines. It'll double the line count for you and might trick someone into merging it.\n\nWant to do something actually useful with your LLM? Write some docs, You will get massive line counts and it'll get merged in a second if it is correct. (particularly the warning around limits/orders which is no longer true).\n\nWant to do something even better? Find something you like working on or use a lot, and just work on that. Rather than trying to sell YAVC SaaS app for $50/month. If you built it in a day, so can everyone else!\n\nThis shit is is super fun to use, and can be used to build amazing things (and hilariously broken things). But build the thing you want to use, not some trash that'll just get ignored in an attempt to get your open source LoC contributions up after the music ended.\n\nP.s. To get anything into sequelize takes at least a couple months of review, because it is barely maintained.

(I’m being vague here because details will lead to my GH which will dox me.) long story short, said OSS project didn’t work - Apple changed their login a couple years ago from posted credentials to SRP and said project hadn’t been updated yet. I pointed Claude at it and asked it to compare the implementation with my HAR of a working auth. It figured out the issue, synthesized existing implementations from a dozen similar projects, and built an updated auth flow in about an hour. So I now had a working solution to the problem and I was happy. \n\nI could have left it there but I checked the contribution guide (I don’t usually contribute to OSS, just work on my professional projects) and found the related issue that had been open for +1y with a lot of affected users. So I added test cases, documented it, and opened a PR according to the guidelines. Within a few hours I had several users comment on the issue with thanks saying they had been waiting for a fix and that it was working for them. Will my PR be merged?

Even messy legacy code.\n\nAnd honestly… sometimes the output is cleaner, more structured, and more defensive than what I see in a lot of production repos.\n\nSo here’s the uncomfortable question:\n\nAre we reaching a point where Claude writes better baseline code than the average developer?\n\nNot talking about genius-level engineers.\n\nJust everyday dev work.\n\nWhere do you think it truly outperforms humans - and where does it still break down?\n\nCurious to hear from people actually using it in serious projects.",

Some of it is even backed by LLMs... And that's before a human review that still finds logic bugs due to misunderstood specs or erroneous assumptions. \n\nBut yet they keep comparing the output of the LLM on a poorly written first prompt Vs their code after a 12 step verification flow... Sure it can be... Give the same effort to improve LLM generated code and I seriously doubt it.\n\nThey are still better at analysing problems and general sw architecture (at least the seniors are.. some of them) but at writing code.. as an engineering manager that train has left the station.\n\nI've been trying to push them toward better understanding the business and becoming more \"translators\" for business needs into tech rather than pure dev only but that's just not going to work for somenof them. \n\nNot sure what the future will be.",

In the end, they are effectively paying a second salary in tokens.\n\nThat said, knowing how corporations operate, the cost will eventually be offset.\n\nI work for a huge contractor farm in Eastern Europe, and I can easily imagine that within two to five years we will be running our own internal farm of highly task-focused, open-weight models like MinMax 2.5.\n\nThe company will simply hide the LLM cost inside the per-developer billing rate, and that will be the end of it.\n\nIn my opinion, Anthropic has the right idea.

If you have a novel approach, and I’m not talking galaxy brained, I mean just something that is not an established pattern in the top few hits in google, good luck. \n\nFor example, I like Astro. I used to use rails. Astro can be very much like rails with a few tweaks (eg Astro actions are a very comfortable swap for something like an ActiveModel validation layer). This is not complicated or even counterintuitive, the docs clearly lay out that you _can_ use actions for forms but they can be called in an endpoint context no problem, which is convenient since actions can’t return response objects (so you can’t use them with something like htmx directly). No use case there that isn’t at least acknowledged in the docs.\n\nI’ll give you one guess as to how well Claude adheres to this pattern. It is written in CLAUDE.md and as a skill and every. single. fucking. time. I need to reject a code change because Claude cannot resist shitting up an endpoint with business logic and validations. It’s too enticing to ignore instructions about the thing which houses the validation schema and which can only return an error or success object, in Claude’s little inferential brain there aren’t enough articles about it so it is invalid, and short of writing it into the official docs, there’s little chance that will ever change because there is no reason to write tutorials or exercise critical architectural thinking any more. It’s a race to the average quality of the corpus from which it cribs its answers, and the quality bar is a few centimeters above rock bottom because the last 15 years of the JavaScript ecosystem is uneven at best in terms of quality and straightforward architectural decision making.",

Plus there's the matter of scope, and a balance to how much mental power you have to contribute vs how much you can offload to Claude. In the long run I suggest you look at Claude not as a programmer, but as a keyboard with really good autocorrect (compared to what is built-in to a phone's virtual keyboard).\n\nLet's start with the raw casts. Can you use a simple keybind in your IDE to correct the raw casts? For example when I see Claude use explicit constructors in C# (\\`List<string> list = new List<string>()\\` instead of \\`List<string> list = new()\\`) I just tell Rider to fix all of those across the entire solution/project. \\*If Claude is making mistakes that can be automatically fixed by your IDE in a couple mouse clicks then I highly recommend just letting it and then using the IDE for what it's good for.\\*\n\nAnother approach is this: Tell Claude \"you did this but [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) explicitly states '<insert exact quote here>'\". Claude will do what AIs do and say \"you're right, I did XYZ when you told me not to do XYZ.\" and it might even apologize. \\*Tell Claude \"it's okay\" and ask it how you can adjust your [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) file so it doesn't happen again\". \\*\\*It will give you recommendations on how to update it to ensure it follows the directions.\\*\\*\n\nAnother thing you can try is have Claude do some work. Then review the work and make all the changes you need to make for the code to meet your desired standards and guidelines. Then ask Claude to analyze the changes you made after it. You can then ask it to provide you with instructions that you can add to your [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) file (or just tell it to go ahead and add on to it for you if you trust it enough).\n\nSide note: Claude and all other AI models are trained on human code and human interactions. In the training data there are millions of examples of rude and polite human interactions via text chats. In natural human interaction, being polite often gets us what we want, so pretending Claude is a human (even though Claude is just a clanker) will also help you out purely because Claude was trained on human interaction and content.\n\nSorry for the long post. I'm down for helping you out more. Keep in mind that I am an AI pessimist. I use it for what it's worth, and it has taken me quite a long time to finally get AI coding to speed me up rather than slow me down. This process for me has been just as much about learning exactly when I should just let the AI cook vs when I need to be more involved as it has been about tweaking the AI to do what I want.",

I wonder if someone will recall that there was a computer system that quoted Leaves of Grass. But I digress.\n\n15 years ago, I turned my hobby into a profession and became a translator. I started using MT from day one and I am still using it, and I was watching the progress.\n\nBut there was one more thing. As I grew into an ever more seasoned translator, I got more and more proofreader/editor/quality assessment/assurance roles, and I could tell that each year the machines grew better and better at this.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back came two times, i.e. the back got broken in two places: first, when Google started using AI instead of the old statistical method and made that quantum leap, I instantly recognized that this was not Kansas anymore. I had some work to do, I put my original into the box and out came the translation, nearly perfect. At that very moment, I knew that they had deployed a brand new engine. I went searching for news and sure enough, it was the same shift they had famously tested on Murakami's prose.\n\nIn 2025, there was yet another paradigm shift. So, out there, my target language is terribly polluted with not-very-smart loanwords and unprofessional, unidiomatic and too direct translations from English. My favourite example is that the word they use today to say that someone is approachable, amenable, nice, a regular person with a no-nonsense attitude — they use the literal translation of \"down to earth\", which in my language in fact means \"lacks sophistication, brutish\". Word order was also turned upside down.\n\nBut then, one day, just like when the first straw fell down and broke the camel's back, I found an engine that was trained on a curated dataset, and now we have engines that translate better than most human translators who call themselves professionals.\n\nAs we speak, someone, somewhere, works on a massive purification of perfected datasets to get models that will do this coding thing even better than they do today. Also, mind you, the topology of process flow models is a finite number and recursion is what creates complexity. I believe that today's coding generators already know that. If they do not, it is also a matter of time before they train them to logically and watertight dissect complex problems into simpler, more atomized ones. I think that this, in and of itself, is absolutely nothing new. It is a matter of weeks or years before it will come together.\n\nFor good measure: humans think that they are intelligent in a way that is outright magical in comparison with machine capabilities. In a way, it is true, but if they learned about how our thinking process truly works, they would probably recognize that this is not much different from an LLM working with something similar to RAG, but with a caveat: while machines store information in a lossless manner, we use compression algorithms and we forget a whole lotta information only to substitute it with what we find logical based on our predispositions (biases).

So the bar is quite low.\n\nNow how we use agentic coding is a whole difference. I’m impressed by the code I’m getting because I refined my agents (main instructions, then subagents, then skills), to do the code I like, and insisted on principes that main stream code bases don’t follow. Opinionated craft, if you prefer. Examples; avoid fallback behavior unless functionally required, as it creates poor traceability and shadow bugs too often. So in the end, it’s the agent default skill + my craft that’s in there. \n\nThen yes, my 200K context Claude code can create something much more disciplined that I can dream of. And I have time to ask for code and architecture reviews where other agents can grill whatever mistakes was made.

It loves inline imports in python since that avoids a failure to find a missing dependency as long as it’s in a class that Claude doesn’t use during validation. Claude loves to ignore fit-for-purpose libraries, like clients for web APIs, and roll its own sloppier version because “I saw that you were using raw http elsewhere and wanted to keep it simple.”\n\nIf you review what it’s doing, give it feedback, and periodically identify larger refactoring tasks to keep code clean, Claude is great. Not only will you improve your own throughput, but you’ll also find Claude having an easier time with future tasks, finishing in less time and with fewer tokens used.\n",

If you don't baby sit it (and i did all the context limiting stuff, believe me), it will ignore instructions and will sloppify your code. \n\n\nYes it can 'fix' your tests, but its fixes are all super short term, never longterm maintanable code. \n\nIm curious about yall. Is your code much better? What am I doing wrong? Why is it digging its own holes and making it itself impossible to test, debug and maintain?",

Il fatto è che \"sviluppare\", grazie ai milioni di librerie free, documentazioni e quant'altro, è diventato già da molti anni 'standardizzato'. I programmatori veri, quelli che implementano cose effettivamente nuove, erano pochi anche prima dell'avvento dell'AI. Solo che prima che arrivasse Claude, potevi guadagnarti da vivere anche come sviluppatore di alto livello, oggi chiunque con un abbonamento di 25$ può scrivere una app o un sito web come qualsiasi sviluppatore 'standard'. Se continuiamo così, nel giro di pochi anni, le uniche figure davvero richieste saranno quelle capaci di programmare e modificare le AI: matematici ed ingegneri con le palle. Essere capaci di scrivere codice in un qualsiasi linguaggio non basta più perché ormai quello è l'entry level (lo fa l'AI).",
