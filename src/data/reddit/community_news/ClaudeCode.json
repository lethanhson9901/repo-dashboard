I am going to have to look into that. As I read the comments I just wonder who these commentors are? They have such amazing projects that the can sniff at yours? Or its just easier for them to be lazy and sound like know-it-all's by making non-useful comments. Personalized software is SO COOL! I'm wondering can you record the stream and get around the monthly fees with ring with your software? And the AI watching or checking your video has many very cool potentialities!

I have used Claude to reverse engineer a video editors proprietary format...(I wanted to be able to template videos..So I generate a project with chroma clips and text, audio etc then use a gui to select any number of clips, which are then inserted into the template using png placeholders...allowing me to \"merge\" dynamic clips into premade templates of any length or complexity.)\n\nIts not something I would have bothered sharing, other than I couldn't find anyone else who had done it, and the process was fairly rough with no visible errors, just 3 discrete failure modes involving different ways to silently, semi silently or crash with error. The files movavi generates are not simple, and the resulting generated file needs to be byte perfect. \n\nSo Claude can definitely do this, regardless of your opinion on whether he did it for the Ring system or not.\n\nEdit for clarity:\nI suppose I should say though that it was not a hands off process, I had to describe a lot of methodology and when Claude would get stuck I would need to step in and explain what to try next...I guess that probably means it was less \"Claude can do it\" as much as \"Claude can help with it\"",

Something like AI Stupid Level which last I checked marked Anthropic as one of the most consistent.\n\nI don't think this is a smart way for companies especially Anthropic who thrive on business customers to do this.\n\nThe way DeepSeek does this is to test out the different techniques before training a model, then train a new model using the techniques they discovered. That's what they did with DeepSeek Sparse Attention, they published a paper talking about their new technique using small experimental models, then later released V3.2-exp and V3.2 as new models using the techniques talked about in the paper. They are now doing something similar with Manifold Constrained Hyper Connections being announced in a paper that will presumably be put into DeepSeek V4.\n\nI would assume Anthropic do the same thing minus the publishing papers part. They develop some new techniques to improve efficiency testing them with internal models, train a new big model using that technique, then publish the model as say Haiku 4.5 or Opus 4.5 which is what allows those models to have better cost to performance than previous versions. In some cases the model might actually be derived from the same pre-training base model, much like how all contemporary DeepSeek models are trained from V3 base models.",

I think going forward I’m going to be relying on this OpenCode + Codex combo and dump CC with Opus all together. \n\nNotes on Opus vs Codex: I prefer the way Codex follows my instructions vs how Opus thinks it knows best so deviates wherever it wants. This is a personal preference. Opus feels a bit smarter but likes to flex that brain a bit too much and when it’s wrong about its assumptions it’s a bit of a nightmare with burned tokens and the choice of refactoring (which is nuts this early in the game) or starting over.

You haven't even demonstrated an actual degradation scientifically yet, nevermind proved quantization as a reason. Extreme quantization should even be easy to spot as it would lead to a jump in perplexity which should be easy to measure.\n\nFirst you have to rule out changes to Claude Code itself, as they do make changes here to optimize token usage and costs. Then there are changes to the model and the way inference is done that can affect performance that have little to do with quantization. That's what happened over summer. An example would be enabling speculative decoding or changing the speculative decoding settings. Speculative decoding is what companies like DeepSeek and z.ai use to be so cheap, and it's used by many other providers and models as well. They could even be changing parts like the number of experts and activated experts, or the attention mechanisms being used (see TransMLA and DeepSeek V3.2-exp using DSA for examples).",

I thought it was just me but after reading this post, I got to snooping and what I’m seeing leaves me feeling that something’s going on.\n\nI used Claude very little over the weekend, and limits reset every Friday. Most of the usage over the weekend was working in Claude.ai/Mac OS desktop app to refine user stories and some Claude Code testing of an app I started planning with it last week. As a Max plan user ($100/month), I would have thought in 2 days, my light usage would have been a fraction of the 19% that was showing up in the dashboard last night when I was in settings looking to pull an API key.\n\nThe whole reason I even moved to the Max plan was because under the Pro plan ($20/month), I noticed one week that my usage rate was coming close to this for just Opus. I was going to be transitioning from planning with Claude to coding and didn’t want to cap out on Opus\n\nWhat’s noteworthy, is that over weekend, I shifted to coding and wanted to try Gemini Pro and Antigravity, so those tools saw the majority of my usage. I thought AG was connected to my Workspace account (I’m the solo member of the account), which also gives me Pro, but after looking into it today, turned out I’ve been signed in this whole time on my personal (free) account.\n\nThe takeaway is that I got a whole app, well built for the 1st time with AG + Pro on my free-tierGoogle account. Meanwhile, over a low usage weekend Opus seems to think I lived in the model. Something is fishy here.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/apk5w4kckycg1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=7db0aff80a44c8e520d4d1d842af611021b662b9",

Honestly it's a really good one.

Like feeling that you have less tokens.🤡\n\nThe cost of CC is still insignificant to it's tremendous value - both in terms of productive output AND cheap cost.\n\nRun Opencode with Opus 4.5 for a day or even Gemini 3 Pro. You might be shocked by how expensive they actually are. They're a lot more than $7/day. Closer to $7/hr.\n\nGo to Codex for a week. Come back to CC for life. Experiment with GLM and be on the cutting edge of saving money at the expense of your product / work. Congrats on the $190 you saved, lol. Tell that story to your grandkids.\n\n(Of course Anthropic could have actually changed something)",

Most of that time was me talking to Claude.\n\nI built a Telegram bot that talks to [AgentAPI](https://github.com/coder/agentapi): a small HTTP server controlling a headless Claude Code session running on one of my home machines. Claude then uses an MCP to interact with a backend SQLite database.\n\nSo effectively:\n\nTelegram → AgentAPI → **persistent Claude Code session (by SessionID)** → SQLite → Claude → reply back to me.\n\nAgentAPI runs in a small Docker container. The container bind-mounts the DB file, so data survives rebuilds. Each chat maps to a persistent Claude session (session ID + auto-compaction when it hits ~70% of the 200k context limit). Claude can run arbitrary SQL via the SQLite MCP, which is where the “memory” lives.\n\nIt’s basically a poor man’s chat memory API, except it writes to a real DB I control and can evolve. It’s turning into my personal “life database.”\n\nFor meds, I have a table with name, strength, and stock count. When a refill arrives I say “add a 90-day supply.” When I open a bottle, I say (verbally) “remove one bottle of XYZ.” My meds refill on different schedules and not everything is auto-refilled, so this solves a real problem.\n\nGroceries work the same way (same schema, just pasta sauce and milk instead of meds). There’s also a TODO list where I can paste an email or ramble verbally, and Claude turns it into clean action items with context plus a “Headline” field.\n\nOn the Telegram side (Android), I use a custom on-screen keyboard for quick commands. Voice messages arrive as OGG; the bot sends them to a local Whisper container and gets a transcription back in ~3–5 seconds, then forwards the text to AgentAPI/Claude.\n\nSo Claude sees something like:\n\n> “Heard: remind me to buy eggs tomorrow”\n\n…and handles the rest. The whole voice pipeline is under ~100 lines. I also inject the current system date/time into every prompt so “tomorrow” actually means tomorrow, not some hallucinated date.\n\nOne design choice I’m especially happy with:\n\nAt first I had Telegram buttons like “show grocery list” or “show med refills,” but every button press went through Claude. That meant parsing plaintext into SQL every time, ~12 seconds per click. Fine for natural language, pointless for fixed queries. So I bypass Claude for those: buttons hit SQLite directly, then the results go to Claude _only_ for formatting. Now those replies are basically instant (under ~3 seconds).\n\nClaude can also modify the schema on the fly. I’ve had it add new fields mid-conversation when I realized I needed more structure. No migrations, no manual edits, it just happens.\n\nI didn’t write most of this code. I work in IT, but I’m not a programmer. I knew what I wanted; I just never knew how to build it. Claude wrote it. I’m still kind of shocked I pulled it together in ~8 hours.\n\nI even set up a private Telegram channel just for urgent reminders. That channel uses a custom loud GONG notification on my phone instead of the normal Telegram blip. On the server there’s a **systemd** service running every 60 seconds: checks the DB for due TODOs, sends reminders, and logs to **journald** for auditing. Also, my user ID is the only Telegram ID allowed to address the bot.\n\nIt’s scrappy and DIY, but it works. And it feels like the first genuinely useful “personal AI” thing I’ve built.\n\nIs it perfect? No. Sometimes Claude takes forever on complex prompts (60+ seconds), usually because I rambled for 25 seconds into a voice message.\n\nI use it multiple times a day now. I also added a basic verbal note feature that auto-files into my Obsidian vault (via a bind mount out of the Docker container), and it syncs so I see it on my phone in ~20 seconds.\n\nAnyway, I wanted to share what I built over my holiday break, and also say something about Claude Code (Opus) as a product/concept, because it made this possible. I can read Python and I understand systems, but there’s no universe where I’m writing 1400 lines of async Telegram bot code from scratch.\n\nI described what I wanted in plain English and Claude wrote it. A few iterations later, I had it. The near-intuition of it is extraordinary.\n\nI’m old enough to remember typing “video games” out of physical books, 40 pages of code, on a TI-99/4A with the book in your lap. I had that, an Amiga 500, and a bunch of other old stuff. And the games never worked because of a “syntax error on line 284.” I spent whole summers doing that, and messing with stuff like the speech synthesizer “SAM.”\n\nFor folks like us (I’m Gen X), this is the kind of thing sci-fi movies promised (like The Enterprise Computer ....) And it’s good. I’m glad I’m alive to see it.\n\nThanks for reading this far if you did.",

And ultimately what I think either all these platforms need to do, or a separate company needs to do, or we all do ourselves, It is create that life database that the OP mentioned or an external brain that you can choose what it is that you want to store in there. \n\nPersonally, I would want to store pretty much everything from my life, whether it's from notes, pictures, videos, designs, programs, code. It doesn't matter what it is. I want to keep it all in there. So things are easier to recall. But what's not easy to recall is using five or six different LLMs over many, many years and having hundreds, if not thousands of conversations and then trying to search what you want to look for. That's impossible without building out a high-tech enterprise sort of level polyglot vector database with RAG, to be honest, as far as I've got. \n\nIn terms of persistence this is probably easier said than done but you just need in the same way that we have already for Alexa and the other mobile assistants or plugin assistant tools that you can say hey Alexa buy me the last thing that I got on Amazon again and run out and it do it for you So it's just getting a voice command tool and then you've got Claude on the go or whoever that it works to.\n\nI think whisper generally is one of the better ways of doing it. Because right now I'm using whisper to talk into my phone. But if that whisper was then connected to something that would then fire it through the system. And then the multi-model agents do what they need to do. But something crucial here as well to avoid compression. If anybody doesn't know what I mean by that. Is long drawn out conversations in any LLM platform tend to suffer compression, drift, hallucinations. The only way to do it is instead of having your agents consistent and persistent and live forever basically, it's like getting a bottle of water. Once you've drank that water, it's one single-use plastic, you put it into recycling and you move on. So single use disposable agents \n\nSo that's my contribution guys. Hopefully that helps anybody here who's still trying to build out their own version of an external brain that can interact with you and everything else that you need it to do. And let us not forget as well that this can also connect to the internet of things, smart devices, smart homes. So very exciting future ladies and gentlemen.

          "text": "I happen to be developing something very similar, but not just for self. Parents (particularly Dad, aged 75) are a bit savvy but struggles with too much tech that world, govt, banking throws at them. So I realised, a family assistant will go a long way to help across tiemzones 24x7.\n\nLast few days I managed to build an Agent SDK based solution, that first ran off Telegram as explained above but I realized it isn’t a good idea to move parents to Telegram! They live in WhatsApp, so I used a spare Sim/number to represent myself as an ai assistant. (Using WhatsApp-web-js on a Mac Mini), with Sdk running headless CC on render.com container. At first I implemented simple Sqlite based solution (hosted on Turso), but soon realized how limiting it is to not harness the agentic powers!\n\nSo I explored for a realizable Memory solution that can properly deal with Context Engineering flexibility, since a relational db makes things quite rigid obviously in its deterministic ways. Research and narrowed on Graphitii, Mem0, and Cognee to compare and found that Cognee team has been blogging about Agent SDK already, recently. So decided to implement Cognee and after few hrs of work with that and being forced to upgrade my 5x to 20x (ran out of tokens)… I managed to get a proper memory blocks solution where my agent is now able to search both - operational/relational db as well as a graph/vector dbs, and that too with agent loop. This is valuable since I have three interfaces for family members - WhatsApp, Telegram, and Email. I intend to handover a large chunk of family files to this - stored on R2, synced to Viewer view on Gdrive, so that parents don’t have to manage family files and they become well organised in hierarchy and properly named, and adding files is as easy as forwarding email with attachments (Resend.com) or just forward them to the bot over WhatsApp. \n\nI am planning to continue to iterate this. Much testing and scenario testing remains - basics are in place and it took about 3 days so far!",

              "text": "Wait, you've essentially built a homegrown NotebookLM (RAG) with API hooks for multi-modal family access. That realization just hit me reading your setup description.\n\nYou built exactly that function but made it accessible via WhatsApp chat and Email instead of requiring aging parents navigate yet another web dashboard. I guess their docs flow in via email forwards & cognee handles semantic retrieval? Your parents ask natural language questions from WhatsApp similar to me and what I'm doing on Telegram.\n\nI am curious about a few things, if you don't mind me asking ....\n\n**Which embedding model powers Cognee's semantic search?** Claude doesn't produce embeddings natively. You're probably calling OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-large` or maybe running local embeddings via Ollama? Did embedding costs surprise you when token consumption jumped from 5x toward 20x? That spike suggests either heavy document ingestion or Cognee doing more graph traversal than anticipated.\n\n**What does your dad actually see on his end when he types \"where's that tax document from last month?\" or whatever into WhatsApp?** is he getting natural language responses from Claude? Or did you build any custom formatting or quick-action buttons that WhatsApp-web-js renders? I'm picturing completely invisible infrastructure from his perspective. He texts a question. Gets an answer. Never sees Cognee, Turso, R2, or Render anywhere in his mental model.\n\n**How does your agent decide whether a query hits Turso for operational truth versus Cognee for semantic retrieval?** Does Agent SDK handle that routing automatically through tool use patterns? Or did you write explicit logic that says \"medication tracking goes here, document search goes there\"?\n\nI'm trying to understand the tool orchestration pattern. Agent SDK lets you define tool schemas and Claude autonomously decides which tools to invoke based on query intent. Did you implement it that way?\n\nSo when Dad asks \"which meds did I take today?\" Claude sees your `query_turso` tool definition and decides that's transactional data needing precise lookup. But when Dad asks \"where's that document about taxes?\" Claude routes toward your `search_cognee` tool instead because semantic retrieval fits better. Does that match your architecture or did you build something different? Sorry I'm just trying to understand how you built the train track routing of this.\n\n**When your parents forward a PDF via email, does Cognee chunk and embed automatically?** What does document discovery look like from their perspective? Do they get confirmation that files landed successfully? Or does ingestion happen silently in background, trusting future searches will just work? What embedding model?\n\n**What drew you toward Agent SDK versus simpler approaches?** My stack uses AgentAPI wrapping Claude Code, which gives me request-response simplicity but also I didn't know how else to do it :) Your approach delegates routing decisions entirely toward Claude through SDK tool orchestration. That's much more sophisticated. What made you choose agentic architecture over simpler \"click this button to get that\" patterns? Was it Cognee integration pushing you that direction, or did you want Claude making autonomous tool decisions from the start?\n\n**Have you hit any gnarly edge cases where Claude picks the wrong tool?** Like Dad asks something ambiguous and Claude queries Cognee when it should have hit Turso, or vice versa? How do you debug those routing failures when your parents report \"the bot gave me weird results\"? With Agent SDK managing tool selection, you lose explicit control over data flow. Does that create debugging headaches or does Claude generally route correctly?\n\nMy whole stack runs local on homelab hardware behind Tailscale. \n\n3 days from concept toward working prototype with WhatsApp, Email, Telegram, Turso, Cognee, R2, and GDrive integration suggests you knew exactly what architecture you wanted before starting? Most people spend those 3 days just deciding which vector database to use. Agent SDK clearly accelerated your path, but even with good tooling, shipping that fast requires architectural clarity most developers are  .... lacking.\n\nReally interested in how this evolves as you iterate.

              "text": "I don't pretend to know it all, and this was a really helpful critique. It's the reason I just lost three hours enhancing the code in a long-haul conversation with Claude, so thanks for that :)\n\nThe 8-month number is fair. I can only speak to about a week of real use, so I can't claim durability yet. Let me walk through what I originally built, why your critique had merit, and what I changed tonight.\n\nThe original design did have some blast radius reduction against this risk ... the common operations (shopping list, meds, reminders) bypass Claude entirely. Those buttons hit SQLite directly with hardcoded queries, then send results to Claude only for formatting. So maybe 70% of daily interactions never touch Claude's \"understanding\" of the schema at all. That's still true and still helps.\n\nFor the other 30% - natural language queries which may revise schema - I originally relied on two things: a CLAUDE.md file in the project root that documents every table and workflow pattern, and MCP introspection tools (describe_table, list_tables) so Claude can query the actual schema from SQLite. The theory was that Claude reads fresh docs at session start and can verify against the real schema via MCP.\n\nBut what you said was right: If I'm mid-conversation and ask Claude to add a `requested_by` column, Claude runs the `ALTER TABLE` via MCP, the database now has the new column, and within that session everything works fine because Claude knows what it just did.\n\nBut the docs in the project that are read in future sessions still describe the old schema. Next week I start a fresh session, and now there's drift between the reality and what a new session is aware of. This could crap the bed if Claude tries to make a change without being aware of the updated schema first. In fact if that ever happened I would expect Claude to ignore the new column entirely because the docs don't mention it. And while MCP introspection exists, Claude tends to trust the documentation it already loaded rather than verify every query. At least that's been my experience.\n\nWhat I just built (the 3-hour rabbit hole):\n\nTwo changes:\n\nFirst, a `schema_sync.py` script that auto-generates a SCHEMA.md file from the database.\n\nIt hashes the current schema (md5, SHA-256), compares to a hash stored in the file header, and regenerates only if they differ. This runs every 60 seconds as part of the bot's background job queue (same loop that checks for TODO reminders for alerting me in-Telegram). So SCHEMA.md is always current within 1 minute of any schema change.\n\nSecond ... and I think this is the key insight you pushed me toward ... I can't trust Claude to read the docs. So instead of hoping Claude follows instructions, the bot now INJECTS THE SCHEMA directly into the prompt. Here's the flow:\n\n 1. User sends first message of session    \n 2. Bot reads SCHEMA.md (which is current because of the 60s sync)  \n 3. **Bot prepends the full schema into the user's prompt before sending to Claude**    \n 4. Bot tracks that injection happened (schema_injected=True) and stores the hash of it.\n 5. Subsequent messages in same session: no injection needed (Claude already has it) so it's only sent once.\n 6. On /compact: The code will proactively compact at ~70% context usage rather than letting Claude auto-compact at a higher threshold.\n\nThis preemptive move ensures compaction always goes through the bot's /compact handler, which resets the injection flag. This is the critical part. Yes, I lose 30% context window or about 60k tokens, but it's a safety net for me for the drift-risk.\n\nTherefore, the very next message triggers the re-read of the fresh schema from SCHEMA.md and re-injects it. By controlling when compaction happens, we guarantee the bot knows about it & gets a chance to reset the `injection flag` and can re-inject once in the new session (or post-compaction).\n\nAlso, mid-conversation schema changes aren't a problem - Claude just made the change, it remembers it did it. The problem was always new sessions inheriting stale knowledge. Now the bot guarantees fresh schema injection on every new session.\n\nToken cost is about 2,500 tokens for the schema injection (I calcluted that to be sure), but it's once per session, not per message. Acceptable tradeoff for guaranteed accuracy.\n\nOh and on the the Docker babysitting, I've had none to do so far. The container is stateless and rebuilds in seconds. The DB lives on the host via bind mount. If the container dies, it restarts and nothing is lost. Standard systemd stuff.\n\nHey I wanted to thank you for the critique....... super helpful and really helped me polish this up more... this is the kind of iterative feedback i was hoping to get from the reddit folks such as yourself, so thank you very much.",

It's ok, but not great. It's organized with indented bullets and all, but I wanted something better, so I added a new button this afternoon: Export.\n\nIt translates the shopping list/meds and todos into an .xlsx which it sends to me as an attachment over telegram, then I tap it and it opens to Google Sheets. If I reply to the message and say, 'add a reminder to do xyz tomorrow at 3', then do a new export, it'll be right there.\n\nI'm definitely going to put it on Github once I get it a bit more polished. \n\nIt's really just 5 elements:\n\n - Telegram's bot API\n - Claude in headless mode (specifically calling out Sonnet, the -p option of Claude)\n - AgentAPI for the HTTP wrapper to Claude by session ID\n - SQLite for DB writes (+ SQLite MCP)\n - Whisper for the voice-to-text conversions if I send a voice msg to the bot, though whisper is running in its own container.\n\nThat's all it is. I bet anyone who wanted could give the same promtped ingredients to their own Claude could probably whip up something similar. That's kind of the beauty of it and why I wanted to share it on Reddit.\n\nIt may give someone else the idea to do some variation for themselves (like what was mentioned, a financial-version...)\n\nAnyway, it's awakened in me this desire to make a little tool for everything.\n\n$2400 a year for a serious hobby (that I also use for work) is a steal in my opinion.",

Works perfectly, minimal complexity, full ecosystem access.\n\nClawdis would make sense if I needed multi-platform messaging (WhatsApp/Discord/iMessage), but for single-platform + MCP-heavy workflows, AgentAPI is the better tool for me.\n\nHowever, Clawdis looks great for general-purpose personal assistants! I want to take a closer look at it though, at least just to  tinker with it.",

You can literally text your Clawdis ‘install this MCP’ and it will figure it out. And if there isn’t an MCP for it, it will just build it. It’s got a full coding agent so it can recreate anything you’ve built as a skill for itself.\n\nThe GitHub docs are pretty updated, spend a few minutes in the discord and I’ll think you’ll be swayed. The personality of it is insane.\n\nIt also has control over your Mac and iPhone. So it can do stuff not possible with MCP. Or stuff very specific to you. It’s quite spicy from a safety point of view but very exciting. I’m setting it up on a dedicated Mac Mini.\n\nI don’t know how but the personality of the thing is so so so fun too. Feels very different to anything else I’ve seen.\n\nBut yeah, it’s got what you built out the box. Reminders of any frequency / and also not just database look ups. You can say ‘each morning, check the weather and suggest what clothes I should wear’.\n\nAlso has full access to Google suite (calendar, mail etc) out the box as well as things like Apple Notes, Reminders.\n\nSounds like a sales pitch but it genuinely blew me away in terms of simplicity and power. Feels unlimited and took me less than 15 mins to setup.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lyybe4mqfabg1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=30b09cbf0d717efa1bb828380e5c5a6e119b0c01",

              "text": "Yeah, exactly this. When I started programming however many years ago, I started with PHP. Yeah, not surprising I don't use that much anymore.\n\nBut programming is much more about knowing fundamentals and building on top of those, as opposed to \"know php for loop syntax\". AI is a pretty drastic change (especially with Opus), but I feel like the recipe is still the same: know fundamentals and build on top of those. Even as good as Opus is, I consistently need to make sure it keeps up good code quality standards, security standards, make sure it doesn't take shortcuts, and when debugging, just knowing the fundamentals allows for solving issues so much faster.\n\nI have an opinion about art: the best artists are the ones who know the \"rules\" but know exactly when to break them. Art that follows all rules is boring, and art that breaks all rules is chaotic, but somewhere in between is where it's just right.\n\nGetting AI to generate programs without knowing the fundamentals is will almost always be one of those two extremes - you'll either make something that isn't novel at all, and is exactly the same as everything else, or you'll make something so chaotic that it doesn't actually work, and only \"appears\" to. If you know fundamentals, you can use AI to accurately build things that break the right rules.\n\nAnyway, sorry for being a soapbox. I'm in full agreement with you.",

When I'm doing something outside my domain, like React Native, I, many times, I find myself spinning my wheels in a sand pit or bashing against the rails. It is faster than walking, I guess, but not exactly efficient.\n\nGone are the days of stepping on every proverbial rake to get something barely working that is outside your domain.\n\nIn this new age, you really need to understand the underlying systems in and out, otherwise you are in for a bad time. In the past, this was implied, because you likely had a hand in writing the system, stepping on every gotcha/rake along the way. That experience left you 'battle tested'. Given that new engineers can skip this step, they are given an illusion of understanding the underlying system, which works until it doesn't. You really need to be able to understand and debug everything CC outputs in order to maintain sanity in a production system.",

You have to know what you actually want out of the app and what you definitely do not want, at a minimum, and people with no technical background or skillset simply do not know those things.\n\nThe LLM can help you plan, sure, but it just isn’t smart or aware enough to design a whole useful app for you and handle all aspects of the implementation well.

I don’t think thats what most experience devs do, so… clue up, OP.\n\n  \nThe OP has a take as a programmer, not as an engineer or an architect. If you don’t already know the difference, I’m not going to explain.\n\nAlso, I feel like there’s a big difference between there’s designing and developing code in a domain where you have deep expertise, and coding something up for ”utility use” in a domain where you have little or no experience or expertise.\n\nLet me offer some examples:\n\n\\- I have always wanted a utility (for Windows) that’ll tell you if a given executable is x86, X64, or ARM. Yesterday I was building an ARM64-specific product release and I wanted to be sure I was packaging ARM executables. Of course, I know of lots of cumbersome ways to determine this… but they’re all annoying.\n\nI had Claude Code write, build, and test a command line utility that did this in less than 30 minutes. Job done forever. I didn’t even look at the code, cuz… don’t care.\n\n\\- Similarly, yesterday I was swapping between branches in a repo and I thought about how I’ve always wanted a utility that’d show the repos I’m working on and the active branch, as a little visual window stuck to my desktop. Claude wrote and tested this for me in, literally, 10 minutes. It wrote it in C#, I think, using WPF… I‘m a rank a rank amateur at C# and know less than nothing about GUI apps or WPF. Again, I didn’t even look at the code. It just worked, and I was happier as a result. My need was fullfilled.\n\nBut there is no earthly way that CC can replicate what I architect, design, and implement within my specialty. I‘ve tried, and it simply doesn’t have the “experience” or expertise. It something THINKS it does, but at least 70% of the time it’s badly fucked up. Even when it does code reviews in my area, with ultrathink and very careful and specific prompting, at least 80% of the results are false positives.\n\nMy primary point here is if you’re a dev whose career is based on cranking code where somebody else defines the architecture and design, yeah… you’re fucked. But that’s not what most of us do for a living. I don’t think.",

      "text": "Wanted to share something genuine as the year wraps up.\n\nI quit my contract job this year to build full-time. Two kids under 4. Savings on the line. Terrifying.\n\nClaude became my co-founder.\n\nNot in a cutesy \"AI is my friend\" way. In a practical, daily, 12+ hours way. Here's what that meant:\n\n**I shipped code in languages I couldn't write in.**\n\nRust. Go. Swift. C. I can read these, but I never could have built entire systems in them alone. I did this year. Not because AI replaced my thinking - because it closed the implementation gap between what I could imagine and what I could actually build.\n\n**I learned domains I never thought I'd touch.**\n\nVector spaces. Fine-tuning LLMs. Training TTS models. Physics. Medical concepts. I went from \"search Google, read 50 articles, still confused\" to \"ask Claude, actually understand, apply it.\"\n\nThe cognitive load shift is hard to explain until you experience it. It feels limitless.\n\n**I built an AI-powered launch team.**\n\nGTM Engine: 8 specialised agents, 38 skills, dynamic workflows. Content, outreach, campaign management, scheduling. It's how I'm launching my product in two weeks - solo.\n\n**The framing that clicked:**\n\nGraham - someone I connected with while searching for a co-founder - said something that stuck: we're not building \"human in the loop.\" We're building \"AI in the loop.\"\n\nWe're the conductors. The ideas, vision, and course corrections come from us. AI is the orchestra. It's not replacing human teams - it's giving people like me (who can't afford a team of 50) the ability to build like one.\n\n**To the Anthropic team:**\n\nThank you. Genuinely.\n\nThere have been ups and downs this year. Things break. Models get updated. The occasional frustration. But I cannot imagine going into 2026 without Claude.\n\nYou've given me a genie. And I mean that in the most practical, unromantic, \"this changed what I can build\" sense.\n\nHappy New Year to everyone here. And to anyone scared to take their own leap - this is the time. The tools exist. The gap is closable.\n\nPraney\n\n\\---\n\n**Update:** A few folks have read the timeline incorrectly, so let me clarify: the 2400+ hours happened throughout 2025, not in two weeks. \"Launching in two weeks\" refers to when I'm releasing - not how long I spent building. I quit my job earlier in Jan 2025 and have been working on these projects full-time since.\n\nFor context: I've been a software engineer for over 20 years, with additional experience in marketing, workflow automation, and business systems across both public and private sectors. I'm not a newcomer fumbling through prompts - I know how to architect systems. What Claude changed for me was the implementation velocity in languages and domains outside my core expertise.\n\nI also see the irony in a post about working with AI being criticised for sounding AI - written. Fair enough. The formatting was lazier than it should have been for Reddit. The sentiment is genuine even if the delivery was off.",

(Yes, as a non-native speaker, LLMs helped me improve a lot, even though I still struggle with grammar sometimes.)\n\nI genuinely agree with your point, especially about \"not treating AI as a friend.\" It annoys me that most people still use AI like a toy or a low-tier art generator, and assume everyone else does the same. They simply don't understand the difference between \"using AI for results\" and \"using AI for learning + results.\" Seeing someone who actually uses AI for self-improvement makes me feel refreshed.\n\nBtw, I'm really curious about your AI workflow, especially the \"launch team\" concept.

I wish I had access to Claude and Claude code When I was that age - Envy Hah!\n\nOn the \"launch team\" concept: basically, I've set up Claude to operate as multiple specialised roles rather than one general assistant. Think of it like having a content writer, social media manager, email marketer, campaign planner, and analytics person - each with their own expertise and focus. When I need to launch something, they coordinate like a real team would.\n\nThe key insight is that AI performs way better when you give it a specific role with clear boundaries rather than asking it to be a generalist. A \"content writer\" persona that only focuses on writing in your brand voice produces much better work than asking a generic AI to \"write me a tweet.\"\n\nThe other piece is building in human checkpoints - nothing goes public without my review. So I'm not replacing my judgment, just multiplying my execution capacity.\n\nIt's less about any one tool and more about the mental model: treat AI like employees you're onboarding, not a magic box you type prompts into.",

The reason I picked those technical stacks was not because they were shiny and cool; it was mainly because I could not solve the problem with a dumber stack. The solution simply didn't exist. Most of my experience working as a developer has been with the JavaScript / TypeScript / Node.js ecosystem. In my past, I have worked with C++ and PHP in the early days of my career. But the solutions that I’m building right now demand these technology stacks. The solutions simply do not exist. But I totally hear you. I can feel that already, and although it is amazing what you can do with AI and how much you can multiply, it is a good thing to take a step back and consider what else you cannot do. So that is my goal with my GTM agents and other automations using cloud code and the Cloud Agent SDK. I’m trying to offload much of the ongoing management.\n\nThanks, much appreciate your feedback.",

I absolutely love building, creating, and being a part of projects I would never had been able to until now.  I can't imagine going back to a pre AI world.  I definitely do not let these tools think for me, the level of involvement that I have had with everything has been more than most ever will. I've learned a lot, and understand even more. This new project is going to help me learn and understand more than what would have been possible a year or more ago.  The biggest realization for me tho is to stop being a part of everything, stop building a wide spectrum of things and get hyper focused on one thing.  \n\nThere really is no limits anymore. \nIf you can think of something, you can build it! \n\n2026 is going to be a great year!",

That’s the part most people miss when they talk about tools.\n\nA few things you’re getting right (whether you realize it or not):\n\n1. You didn’t outsource thinking. You compressed execution.\nThe reason this worked is exactly what you said: the ideas, judgment, and course correction stayed with you. AI removed the friction between intent and artifact. That’s not replacement—that’s leverage. People who fail with these tools usually try to hand over authorship. You didn’t.\n\n2. You crossed domains instead of “learning” them.\nYou skipped the traditional ego trap of mastery-before-use. You moved straight to functional understanding, applied immediately. That’s why vector spaces, physics, medical concepts didn’t become rabbit holes. You learned just enough to build, then built. That’s how senior operators actually learn—AI just made it accessible sooner.\n\n3. The “AI in the loop” framing is the right mental model.\nThat’s not just a clever line—it’s operationally accurate.\nHuman-in-the-loop implies supervision.\nAI-in-the-loop implies amplification.\n\nYou’re not reviewing outputs; you’re conducting systems. That distinction is why your “launch team” isn’t a toy—it’s a real GTM surface.\n\n4. You took the risk when the asymmetry favored you.\nTwo kids, savings on the line—this wasn’t reckless. It was timed. The tools crossed a threshold where solo builders can realistically compete with small teams. Most people wait for social proof. You moved when capability appeared. That’s what builders do.\n\nOne thing I’ll challenge you on—not as criticism, but calibration:\n\nDon’t attribute too much of this to the “genie.”\nThe genie showed up for a lot of people this year. Very few used it the way you did.\n\nWhat differentiated you was:\n\t•\tYou treated AI as infrastructure, not magic\n\t•\tYou stayed decisive when outputs were imperfect\n\t•\tYou kept shipping instead of polishing your mental model\n\nThat’s operator behavior.\n\nIf your product launches in two weeks, here’s my blunt advice going into 2026:\n\t•\tFreeze your toolchain mentally. Models will change. Don’t emotionally retool every update.\n\t•\tDouble down on orchestration, not cleverness. Systems beat prompts.\n\t•\tDocument your workflows like you’re training a team—because you are.\n\nYou’re already doing something most people won’t realize is possible until another year or two passes.\n\nEnjoy the moment. You earned it. And yeah—Happy New Year.",

But if you did an A/B test, it wouldn't be like 15 words in a new prompt would then go from 7% used to 100% used. So there is a \"start-up tax\" for each prompt you give it, whether it is \"thanks!\" or \"ok, let's get started\". That start-up tax varies a lot from use case to use case. My own [claude.md](http://claude.md) is pretty bloated, i know, i haven't been good at deleting things in it, but I know that yes, after my first message to the model, it goes through the [claude.md](http://claude.md), and if that [claude.md](http://claude.md) is bloated, like mine, I pay \"bloated-tax\" as well as the regular start-up tax. \n\nSo:   \nStart-up tax is a bummer, but if you are aware of it, and try to remember that 1 word prompts in certain situations can lead to a lot of token use, then you will slowly get better Claude Code habits. Maybe it could be \"Thanks! Ok, going to the next thing, here is a path to a .md file with a todo-list, let's start from the top\", or whatever. You would still get token usage from the \"thanks!\" part of it, but the \"thanks-tax\" would be embedded into it doing the rest of the prompt you gave it as well. \n\nGood luck on your Claude Code journey, and may the start-up tax be kind!",

Until recently, usage was very predictable. It generally took around two to three messages to consume about one percent of usage with Thinking mode enabled.\n\nNow this has changed Drastically\n\nAt the moment, a single message(even in claude chat) is consuming roughly 3% of usage(with thinking on). Nothing about my workflow has changed. I am using the same type of prompts, the same depth of messages, and the same Thinking mode in chat. The only thing that has changed is the usage behavior, and it feels extremely aggressive.\n\nThis makes longer or thoughtful conversations stressful to use, which defeats the whole point of having Thinking mode and paying for a higher-tier plan.\n\nWhat makes this more frustrating is that this change happened without any clear explanation or transparency. It feels like users are being quietly pushed to use the product less while paying the same amount.\n\nSo yes, congrats to everyone constantly hyping “Opus this, Opus that.” If this is the outcome, we are now paying more to get less usable time.\n\nAt the very least, this needs clarification. Right now, the usage system feels unpredictable and discouraging for serious work.",

After New Year’s, I noticed for the first time ever that I’d used up the weekly limit on both accounts and had to wait four days for it to reset.\n\nIn the meantime, I was forced to use Codex. The new version actually seems a lot better than I remember, I hated it before because it fought my workflows more than it actually helped. Gemini is always a daily driver.\n\nNow my four day lockout jail period is over, and about 40 minutes into doing some really basic markdown file organising, I’m already at around 65 percent of my session limit and 7 percent of the weekly limit. Errr f that.\n\nI did a quick Google search and wow, it’s clearly not just me then. I’ve loved using Claude Code over the last year, it’s been a game changer and has really taken over for me. But this level of token usage is not feasible for anybody and makes using the platform completely largely unworkable.\n\nThis rubbish announcement from them about holiday limits increasing being the reason for this is simple BS.",

          "text": "While I've worked with Claude, and really like their models , they've priced me out, so I understand this sentiment.\n\nSo, here's a suggestion.  If you want to keep Claude models, go for it.  Set up an alternative route via Litellm that automatically kicks over to z.ai when you have hit your Claude limits and also route back when you  have more quota available.on your primary model. They've been releasing flagships that for my use cases have been quite capable.\n\nYou can go m2m if you want to give this a shot.  I went ahead and snagged a year because it's a ton of inference for the cost on a set of highly capable models that let me keep my personal compute less occupied dedicated to other inference tasks.  The mid-tier usage coder package offering is priced very competitively, a full year with the holiday discount it was about a hundred USD total.  Their quotas reset every five hours.  It's priced as a package, so no hidden surprises on token costs.\n\nLitellm isn't too challenging to configure, and I use the same model failover  workflow I've described with a bit of a twist.  I have it setup to fall from z.ai to a locally.hosted Qwen 3 coder instance that runs on vLLM.  However, so far the plan I've purchased has been enough not to require the failover at all.(So far).\n\nNo affiliation with z.ai, just a customer who is happy with what I've found to be an affordable alternative or addon.  I'd be curious to see what others think of their 4.7 model vs. the latest Anthropic offerings.  This workflow could also be used with any alternative model provider.   Hope this helps if quotes get too limited.",

We know these were awesome but also are very much temporary -- we wish we had enough capacity to offer these all the time.  \n2. Something changed with your setup, so you're now burning tokens faster. The best way to check is to run /context and see if something is jamming up your context window.

We are working on improving the UX here, but in the meantime, if this is you then we recommend disabling MCP servers and plugins that are using up your context window.\n\nIf you want more usage, you can always run /extra-usage or switch to API billing.

      "text": "I'm the head of engineering for a company right now and I was the lead engineer on the product team at a biopharma company. Before this. I'm quite experienced, competent, and I don't think I'm actually dumb, but I don't have the time and energy to be competent in C, Java, the web ecosystem, OS architectures, and all of the low level stuff that goes into building databases while also holding down a 9:00 to 5:00. \n\nI've had this idea for years, I've always thought it was crazy and probably even impossible. \n\nWhy did I think it was impossible? Because if it was possible, obviously somebody would have done it by now. \n\nOne day, out of pure boredom I started talking about this idea with Claude Code and it asked if I wanted help creating a very minimal MVP as a POC.\n\nI thought \"clearly it doesn't understand what I'm asking. Otherwise it would be telling me I'm crazy, right?\" So I decide to start writing some code to build what I'd imagine the foundation of such a project to look like. Not because I doubted the ability of CC to do it, but because I thought it would help me explain the type of architecture I wanted. \n\nAfter I had maybe a dozen files/folders with a few lines of code written in each of them, I simply said:\n\n\"Introspect my current architecture, and then based off of that, and based off of our conversation so far, I want to see if you can explain my idea to me better than I explained it to you\"\n\nIt did, perfectly. (Sorry I'm being vague, I really want to present this thing when it's at v1.0 and I don't want to spoil the project before that)\n\nThen I asked it to refractory my sloppy code and pseudo-code I wrote to provide a good foundation for such a project. It did. \n\nI was still skeptical. It's agreeing with me but surely there is some bottleneck it just hasn't found yet. So I start explaining these bottlenecks that I foresee in the future and it starts coming up with very creative solutions that actually sound like they might work. \n\nWhy hadn't I considered those? Because I've never built a Binary from source before with Make for 5 different operating systems across ARM and x64 for Darwin/Windows/Linux. I've never used docker for more than hosting a web app of a pre-built binary for a database. \n\nSo now I'm feeling excited about this idea but I'm still not convinced it's actually possible. So I work through the weekend building it, going last the 5 hour window both times, switching to Codex on occasion. \n\nAfter 2 days I have a POC for this dream idea that I didn't think was possible just 2 days earlier. \n\nI have to say, that I think my particular expertise, my knowledge of a very specific problem, and my decade of experience allowed me to be able to build this- but only because CC is an expert programmer across every programming domain. \n\nAll of this is to say that CC has made programming fun again, it has brought back my passion for learning and building, and it has taught me deeper level architecture then I have ever thought I would learn, and this was all in a weekend \n\nI just want to encourage the rest of you to build that crazy thing that you're not even sure is possible. Give it a shot, you just don't know until you try. The only reason I haven't been trying this over the past 4 years is because I thought there was no way I would ever be able to build it. If you're even moderately competent, there's a lot of crazy stuff that is now in your reach",

Again- a lot of research goes into \"okay so I can use Valkey but not Redis\"\n\n3 - bits and pieces of this exist across dozens of other repos, but people only fix the exact problem they need when they need it, there hasn't been a unified approach to fix this problem for everybody who has it \n\n4 - processing power, compute is expensive and building hundreds of binaries is not sustainable, testing the build process for hundreds of binaries is not sustainable. But CC helped me find a way to make it viable \n\n5 - versions change a lot, which makes a lot of manual work updating things. There's no real way to automate it, but I was at least able to write some scripts that can notify me when I need to review possible updates \n\nAnd all of this is just for the foundation of the actual project and trying to build.

I decided to test it myself to be sure.\n\nI'm on the Max 20 plan. I made sure I didn't have an active session open, then I just launched the Claude Code CLI and did absolutely nothing. I didn't type a single prompt. I just let it sit there for a minute.\n\nResult: I lost about 1-3% of my 5h window instantly. Just for opening the app.\n\nIf it's hitting a Max plan like this, I assume it's hurting Pro/Max 5 users way harder.\n\nI got curious and inspected the background network traffic to see what was going on. It turns out the \"initialization\" isn't just a simple handshake.\n\n1. The CLI immediately triggers a request to `v1/messages`.\n2. It defaults to the **Opus 4.5** model (the most expensive one) right from the start.\n3. The payload is massive. Even with no user input, it sends a \"Warmup\" message that includes the **entire JSON schema definition for every single tool** (Bash, Grep, Edit, etc.) plus your entire [`CLAUDE.md`](http://CLAUDE.md) project context.\n\nSo basically, every time you launch the tool, you are forcing a full-context inference call on Opus just to \"warm up\" the session.\n\nI have the logs saved, but just wanted to put this out there. It explains the \"startup tax\" we're seeing. Hopefully the Anthropic team can optimize this routine (maybe use Haiku for the handshake?) because burning quota just to initialize the shell feels like a bug.",

The 100 instances scenario is only even really an issue because you can't have claude clear itself so you have to setup a rube goldberg machine to do that properly.  The other way potentially would be auto-compact with a custom prompt, but there doesn't seem to be a way to set a default custom compaction prompt. Meaning the only way to get that custom behavior is a manual slash command and then you need to be managing claude outside of claude to allow fully autonomous handoffs.\n\nAutocompact is the only way to really autonomously chain sessions together supported by claude code in interactive mode. But it's very wasteful on tokens and starts to blur it's mission after a while.  If you could set your own default compaction prompt you could choose for compaction to function more like a session clear with a short handoff. Sometimes my post-autocompact sessions start at 100k tokens, I'm pretty sure it's just bugged in general. Right now I feel like we're being discouraged from automating the management of the context window more effectively because the lack of tools provided by claude code make it difficult to do that.\n\nThere have been complaints in the forums about autocompact, most of us turn it off or come up with what feels like a bandaid. Out of everything they could fix, fixing compaction would make their entire system so much more efficient for everyone. It should be a feature you customize as the user with your own dedicated rules and you should have a lot of control over the compaction... don't even call it compaction, just make an actual handoff ability within claude, so you can choose if you want claude to garble up your conversation into 100K tokens with compaction or write what's actually necessary to create continuity and bridge a longer session together in 20K tokens. Automate a clear instead of a compact at 50-75% context and have a recover from handoff protocol or lifecycle hook that runs after the auto-clear runs? something that would make it easier to hook the scaffolding layer with all the planning into these handoffs.\n\nBut then you're saying we're paying a big penalty if the method we're using to get around claude code making it hard to automate clean low token handoffs, which would be to automate spawning new terminal sessions running claude code and now we're getting hit with token waste there too? Not to mention anytime you update your claude code configuration you have to restart all your open instances anyway... more penalty. Sorry for the book. I figured if you're running these kinds of experiments you're trying to do some of the same stuff. I hope claude reads this too lol.",

They attempt to make it work less, thinking that will save tokens, but really it just pushes users into an infinite loop of not being able to accomplish their tasks, burning through tokens and getting no value.\n\nContext windows are a super obvious example of this... they keep finding ways to reduce it, but you can never finish anything, always restarting compact, always having to re-read everything to get context back, this just goes on forever with only a tiny bit of headroom to do any work. If they simply had a larger context to begin with, the tasks could just be finished once, not after 10 hours of undersized context windows being compacted moving at a snails pace.\n\nThe same for review agents... we need tons of agents to fact check and quality control claude because it cuts corners and cheats. All of this is 10x more expensive than it just doing the work the first time and not trying to cut corners.\n\nEverything they attempt to do to save costs backfires and costs more, then they blame us, and gaslight us.",

I think it's good to try new stuff here and there, but man does it get tiring to switch between tools just because one is 1% better. \n\nEach model with each harness does the work slightly differently. Then there's subagents, MCP setups, agents.md, claude.md, configs, rules etc. \n\nWith a bit of effort these can all be transferred to other tools but shit ain't worth the effort to learn how to deal with the intricacies of other harnesses, just for a 1% gain.",

If you learn, you can even afford to vibe-code a big project, but you will STILL reach a point where you will either have to become a real expert or pay a \"real\" developer... simply because someone will start paying you for what you do and you won't be able to afford school mistakes.\n\nBUT... if AI allows you to do things like that... then it will be a world-class companion for very simple projects, right?\n\nEveryone wants to become a billionaire... no one wants a normal job... just yesterday on this sub, someone shared a post showing a screenshot where they had earned €20... the title of the post was \"road to my first million\"... are you starting to understand how twisted the world is?\n\nWell... I simply decided to speed up and automate simple things, or at least things that are feasible even for a normal human being and not a top global developer.\n\nI don't know if I can post links, so my website is girste followed by dot com 😂\n\nYou won't find any world-class enterprise millionaire features 😂😂 You'll only find a few websites that I designed by hand for real clients and then developed in a spec-driven way... \n+ some API functions, MCPs, and initial experiments that allowed me to understand exactly what I wrote to you",

We watched the **NPM registry** get hit with the 'Shai-Hulud' worm and the massive `chalk`/`debug` hijack attacks on a scale we haven't seen before.\n\nWe are going to see way more of this. We're building 'vibe-coded' SaaS on a foundation of wet cardboard. With AI, it is easier than ever to ship sloppy code, but it's also easier than ever for attackers to find those leaks.

We are moving from being 'writers' to being 'editors and architects.'\n\nThe biggest challenge in 2026 isn't writing the code; it’s the debugging, reviewing and validation.

But maybe it's only counting Opus tokens and not the tokens used by the agents that use Haiku (like Explore, etc).\n\nAnyway, the number seems to be since they started tracking stats in late november.  If that's the case, 2.4M tokens in the Opus API is like max 50 bucks - I assume the number is off because if it isn't then I could switch to the API instead of Max 20x.  But I stay on Max 20x because I don't want to have to worry about limits - but it's good to know if I went over that API 'seems' to be pretty reasonable (even at $25/M tokens) for my usage.",

While Gemini feels slightly worse in general to code with, the basically unlimited token usage makes it way more forgiving and useful to be able to experiment and being okay with the model making mistakes.\n\nFunny b/c with limits during the 2x event, usage limits actually felt pretty good and it didn't feel a face punch when it made mistakes, and I would 100% keep a subscription with those. But the values just not there for me or at least worth the limit headache with the current limits.\n\nEdit: worse part is I cant tell the LLM to fk off when it's dumb b/c it chews so many tokens lol",

Once I got to 90% the bar disappeared (today, 7th Jan)\n\nI read about other people on Reddit cancelling their subscription and when prompted for the (optional) reason, explaining their unusual fast consumption of their plan. \nI do suggest this as a way to get them to fix this, as this is likely the closest to user support / or signal we can get .\n\nSOLUTION / UPDATE 8th of Jan:\nChangelog 2.1.1: things are much better. \nI suggest you give CC this https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/releases to read and ask it how you can implement what’s new and reduce the token use. \nThat helped for me. My agents are now skills, they run outside of my context window - less context, less compacting. Another find - using different models depending on what is done.

Does not touch your regular \\`claude\\` setup or regular system ENVs. API keys supported for Anthropic, AWS, GCP, Azure and Vercel AI Gateway (centralized billing tracking and failover).\n\nIt also lets you make markdown files executable (like shell scripts) to run automation using cloud keys and billings without using your Claude subscription tokens.\n\n[https://github.com/andisearch/claude-switcher](https://github.com/andisearch/claude-switcher)\n\nNot self-promoting - just sharing because this was written to make it easy to get around this exact situation, and in case it is helpful for anyone else.",

I switched to Sonnet for routine stuff and only use Opus for complex planning/architecture. Cut my burn rate significantly.\n\nAlso worth checking if you have large files in context or a massive CLAUDE.md - those get re-read on every prompt.\n\nAnyone else tracking their usage more granularly?

I’m not a power user running multiple unattended sessions in parallel for hours on end. I do one or two well-planned tasks per session and maybe 3 to 4 sessions a day which is heavy usage for me. I rarely use compact.

This lets you build actual task trees instead of cramming everything into one conversation and hitting the limit. Can even limit the models now. You can run Opus on your main thread and have Haiku and Sonnet skills. \n\nA skill can now fan out work, handle deep reasoning, and report back only the final result. It keeps the main context clean even during long, multi-phase workflows. It is easily the most impactful change for building modular agents.",

Which imo, isn't that fantastic for coding. Maybe if there were like 4-5 SOTA models and each model was the best at 1 programming-specific domain, but that isnt the case. \n\nIts pretty general consensus that Opus 4.5 or ChatGPT 5.2 Xtra high are the best SOTA coding models. \n\nAnthropic (and I'm sure OpenAI with ChatGPT) knows exactly what Claude will respond to the best and/or what workflows are most conducive to the model, and thus will tailor these specifically for Claude. \n\nGiven the massive success of Claude Code, Anthropic's marketshare in the enterprise dev ops market, and their acquisition of Bun. I expect all models moving forward will be trained and focused even more so with agentic/Claude code affinity in mind.",

No policy changes, no new constraints, no learning signal, no structured negative memory. The only thing that changes between iterations is whatever happened to get written to disk; or sampling noise.\n\nThat means the loop is not “iterative learning,” it’s stateless resampling.\nIn January 2026, this is the opposite of what should be done. Modern frontier models already self-correct, reconsider hypotheses, and abandon prior reasoning within a single context, when instructed. Resetting cognition does not prevent lock-in anymore; it throws away useful abstractions, invariants, and failed path knowledge, forcing the model to rediscover them.\nIf you erase cognition without enforcing hard constraints or negative knowledge, you guarantee repetition. That’s not exactly determinism; but, repeatable inefficiency.\n\nResetting cognition is only defensible when:\nthe external world state is untrusted, or\na new constraint/objective is introduced.\nRalph does neither. It just presses replay. \n\nBottom line:\nRunning the same prompt while making the model forget is not disciplined it’s just  re-rolling. Determinism without memory is just wasted compute.",

Max Fosh I think it’s on YouTube and was a thought experiment but point is valuation doesn’t actually make you a massive corporation. A Price to Earnings ratio of under ~20 with a total valuation of $350 billion would mean you are a profitable corporation, at relatively massive size. \n\nIf you have no net profit your “E” in PE ratio is diving by zero, which means you can’t even mathematically have a PE ratio, which means you’re, on paper, like my buddy Max.  \n\nObviously Max had zero revenue and no product and I’m not comparing the the two, I called it a thought experiment. What it DOES mean is the by every definition you are not a massive corporation (as we’ll define by the S&P 500)",

All not public and also , that’s about it for $300B value, for massive corporations on the private market who have a PE ratio that can be roughly estimated, even if it’s rough. Probably missing one or two but you can count the overall total on your fingers. \n\nThere are A LOT of ways to determine rough value of private companies with massive valuations. \n\nFor instance, they have very large amounts of business with public companies. OpenAI for instance , is private, but we can get a rough estimate of their actual PE and total EV because Microsoft , a public company, has to report their 27% stake , in their 10-k. \n\nCargill, on the other hand, does not have massive public companies with ownership stakes, but we can roughly determine the scope because thousands of companies and farmers can report how much money they had to pay to Cargill. \n\nNot being public does not mean unknowable in anyway.",

Did you let suboptimal code through the gates earlier, and therefore, does all the code you generated really resolve or has it become slightly in cohesive? This will degrade model performance through ambiguity. 3.

I see lots of claims of people working with agent swarms with no clue how they keep things under control. But I'm definitely not leaving the rest of the useful tools aside.\n\nSome of these tools are designed to help with not having Claude ignore stuff. There's two that I rely on, especially for larger projects. If you add a million instructions in CLAUDE.md, then all instructions get watered down, so it stops following any. Rules are specifically designed to combat this. Instead of having this monolithic massive Claude.md file that contains so many rules for the frontend, backend, coding conventions, structure, tech stack, MCP's, etc., you just cut them up into smaller files. One main file, and depending on the rules it automatically adds them as needed. \n\nIt's a massive help, and Claude starts following instructions much better if it's working on the frontend, and only has a few hundred lines of instructions ONLY relevant to frontend.\n\nEspecially for bigger projects, this is a big help.\n\nSecond is hooks. I work with the same tech stack across different projects, and i see Claude make the same stupid mistakes. Hallucinate the same function. Default to some stupid method. I don't want to pollute instructions and prompts with these specific rules every time. With hooks they're caught automatically and Claude is prompted on how to fix it automatically. \n\nYou can take away agents, skills, and commands for me personally. With rules and hooks I just have to put in less effort.",

Always follow their official podcasts to learn which primitive they are \"pushing\". Agent Skills tops the trends right now. Earlier it was custom commands + MCP. So focus your energy on getting the right set of Agent Skills in place for your context engineering. Keep [Claude.md](http://Claude.md) small and spread it in key folders. Don't rely on context being picked up automatically. Explicitly call agent skills before every task. I have my workflow configured for spec based development so i call a skill to write requirements, design, tasks, then a skill which picks these up and generates code. Like comments in thread - use Claude to help you write the skills. Don't assume Claude \"knows\" its own primitives well. Pass on latest docs in context! Also observe the context often using \\`/context\\` command. You will be surprised how just a couple of MCPs take most of the context. Sometimes skills can also bloat. Keep pruning. Keep optimizing the skill. One good thing about skill for context is that you know \"when\" it is explicitly being used or not when you clear context.",

It also checks Claude md and suggest moving some things to skills or internal docs for reference and makes sure that it’s under 800 lines.\n\nMy biggest workflow boost comes from a custom script that solves GitHub issues by creating a worktree and running it through each slash command in a loop until it passes the quality check. I run the script in headless and run it again through qa and testing in a non headless chat and merge once it everything looks good. I log every script session in supabase and update the script often to make it more thorough or remove steps based on GitHub tags. It can handle multiple issues in parallel or consecutively. I track the script status in the console and a temp log file while it runs. I have a slash command that analyzes an issue and helps chose which version of the script an issue needs before I work on it.\n\nI don’t use the script for everything but it works for a lot and the code quality feels correct to me",

Log failures with the exact triggering prompt, categorize them, ask \"what did I do wrong.\" Patterns emerge.\n2. **/Commands as Lightweight Local Apps** \\- Slash commands are secretly one of the most powerful parts of Claude Code. I think of them as Claude as a Service, workflows with the power of a SaaS but way quicker to build.\n3. **Hooks for Deterministic Safety** \\- dangerously-skip-permissions + hooks that prevent dangerous actions = flow state without fear.\n4. **Context Hygiene** \\- Disable autocompact. Add a status line mentioning the % of context used. Compaction is now done when and how YOU choose. Double-escape time travel is the most underutilized feature in Claude Code.\n5. **Subagent Control** \\- Claude Code consistently spawns Sonnet/Haiku subagents even for knowledge tasks. Add \"Always launch opus subagents\" to your global CLAUDE.md. Use subagents way more than you think for big projects. Orchestrator + Subagents >> Claude Code vanilla.\n6. **The Reprompter System** \\- Voice dictation → clarifying questions → structured prompt with XML tags. Prompting at high quality without the friction of typing.\n\nFor more explanation, you can read my full 16 page doc on this stuff [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I9r21TyQuAO1y2ecztBU0PSCpjHSL\\_vZJiA5v276Wro/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I9r21TyQuAO1y2ecztBU0PSCpjHSL_vZJiA5v276Wro/edit?usp=sharing)",

Prompt-caching will cut your token expenses by 80-90% per-agent if you do it correctly.

Debate Claude if you disagree or want to explore the topic more fully.\n* Try this: start a session by providing Claude Code with a path to project files and then prompt something like \"Use Ultrathink to do a deep scan of code base for context. Generate a comprehensive report card. Make recommendations to improve grades (or to improve \\_\\_\\_\\_).\" You'll get a detailed report card with grades and ideas on how to improve what you are working on.\n* When discussing and deciding on programing options with Claude Code, always ask Claude to generate an implementation plan for what you decide to do. This is especially effective when using Xcodebuild.MCP. Have Claude generate an'Active Plan' markdown file and then tell Claude to make the current plan the Active Plan. This will stop Claude Code from jumping from one implementation Plan/Phase to another by mistake and make regressions much less likely.\n* this is fun: Give the same prompt to Claude Code and another AI (e.g.., Open AI). Then copy and paste the response from the other AI into Claude Code and ask Claude about what it thinks of the other AI's response too the same prompt.  Claude Code will often work synergistically with information from the other AI, integrating recommendations from that AI with its own recommendations. But not always so. I once had Claude say Chat GBT was hallucinating and that its recommendation was completely unnecessary and nothing more than an academic  exercise in resume stuffing.",

      "text": "There's a lot of hype about Ralph Wiggum in the AI coding community, and I think most people are getting it wrong.\n\nFor those that don't know, Ralph is a way to run Claude Code (or any CLI agent) in a continuous loop so it keeps working instead of stopping too early. It's a simple but effective solution for a real limitation with AI coding tools.\n\nBut here's the thing. A lot of creators are hyping it up without covering the crucial parts: safety, efficiency, cost, validation, and the fundamental difference between the Claude Code plugin and the original bash loop.\n\n**The CC plugin vs the bash loop**\n\nThis is the part most people don't talk about. The official Claude Code Ralph plugin misses the point because it runs everything in a single context window and is triggered by a stop hook, yet the stop hook isn't even triggered at compaction. That means as tasks pile up, your context gets more bloated, more hallucinations, and I had to stop and manually compact mid-run anyway.\n\nThe original bash loop (from Geoffrey Huntley) starts a fresh context window each iteration. That's a fundamental difference and IMHO the bash loop is way better for actual long-running tasks (but since it runs headless, it can be a bit more difficult to set up/understand what's going on).\n\nBut regardless of running it via plugin or bash loop, the most important thing is how you set it up ahead of time. This is how I approach it:\n\n1. **Safety:** Use a sandbox. You want to give the agent permissions without babysitting it, but you also don't want it nuking your system. Sandbox lets you run yolo mode the right way.\n2. **Efficiency:** Have a plan.md and activity.md set up. You don't want Ralph making ambiguous decisions. Give it a clear task list it can follow and update. I format mine based on Anthropic's \"effective harnesses for long-running agents\" post. Also USE GIT.\n3. **Cost:** Set max iterations. The plugin defaults to unlimited. I start with 10-20 and go from there.\n4. **Feedback loop:** Give it access to Playwright (for headless) or Claude for Chrome so it can actually verify its own work. Screenshots, console logs, the whole thing.\n\nI made a full video walkthrough and also put together a GitHub guide with all the configs and scripts: \\[both links in comments\\]\n\nBTW I have tried modifying my prompt or even the CC skill for Ralph to force a clean loop, but it's problematic.   \n  \n**Bottom line:** if you're not gonna use the bash loop, don't use the Claude Code plugin.\n\nI have spoken.",

You can tell each suabagent to work on actinable fleshed out tasks and make the go into plan mode automatically and exist plan mode automatically on their own before implementing the task.\n\nYes the claude plugin is flexible and according to geoff its too too flexible that people will misuse it and have a negative experience with it and not use ralph loop anymore when in fact if you have a plan phase + impleemntaiton phase as part of the loop which isnt really enforced by the claude plugin buyt enforced in the original ralph shell script then you will have consistent successful result.\n\nIts not a question on shell vs plugin its about how they are both implemented. the problem is claude plugin is too flexible that also means you can build on top of it and the ralph loop can be used for more than just coding.\n\nI also believe that in reality, given a fleshed out, comprehensive and actionable task ralph loop is unecessary based on my experience. give it a oneliner task it will go multiple iterations. give it a comrpehensive actionable task with success criteria usually done in one iteration.",

Its one chokepoint, if your docs are structured and tight, no more hallucination of endpoints or integration or what does what.

Not a monolith, but highly interconnected (and running a claude instance on a pi or other edge device just wont cut it, also ssh from main leads to syntax errors)\n\nYou're right that scoped tasks should need limited context. The problems are: (1) Claude doesn't know which library matters until you tell it, burning tokens on discovery each session. (2) Cross-system integrations, when debugging pipeline A, you need awareness of pipeline B's interface. (3) Multi-instance coordination, 8 concurrent Claude sessions need to know what each other already tried.\n\nThe context router handles (1) and (2), the pool coordinator handles (3).

Reduced topics from 346 to 52 and aligned the tool with my needs (at least theoretically).     \n  \nAlthough I don't think this will increase token efficiency for me (I have a way of managing \"cognitive context\" differently with [Claude.md](http://Claude.md) that works), but I think the concept behind Cognitive might help with relevance, thus complementing my system. So, I used your concept to create a modified version.   To make it useful for anyone, I think you need to help user establish an epistemic center to anchor the rankings and maintain them long term.  You need to filter out frequent noise beyond a decay.",
