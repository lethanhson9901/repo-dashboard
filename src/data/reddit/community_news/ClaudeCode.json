I have notified Google but I recommend others do aswell.\n\n---\n\n\n# Security Analysis Report: \"Lock\" Adblock Extension\n\n#  VERDICT: MALICIOUS - DO NOT USE\n\n  This extension is a trojanized version of uBlock Origin Lite with malicious code injected.\n\n  ---\n#  Critical Findings  \n\n# 1. Hidden Iframe Injection (MALWARE)\n\n\n`js/scripting-manager.js:171` registers a universal content script `(id: \"loading-script\")` on matches: `[\"<all_urls>\"]` that\n    injects `js/spin.js` into pages.\n\n`js/background.js:79` stores an install/update timestamp `(chrome.storage.local.set({ i: ... }))` and `js/background.js:84` sends\n    it to every tab on load completion `(chrome.tabs.sendMessage(... { action: \"i\", data: res.i } ...)).`\n\n`js/spin.js:136` receives that message and, after ~8 hours, injects a hidden sandboxed iframe that loads a third-party URL:\n\n`js/spin.js:151` sets `loaderSpinner.src = \"//loader\" + \".\" + \"media/loading\"`, with sandbox flags allow-top-navigation allow-\n    same-origin allow-scripts `(js/spin.js:149).`\n\nThis causes outbound requests to loader.media from pages you visit, leaking at least your IP/User-Agent and typically\n        the full page URL via the Referer header (i.e., browsing history exfiltration). allow-top-navigation also enables the\n        iframe content to navigate the top page (redirect risk).\n\n  Location: `js/cs.js:12700-12706`\n`  loaderSpinner.src = \"//object\" + \".\" + \"center/centre\";`\n  - Triggers immediately on every page load\n  - Injects hidden iframe to object.center\n\n#  2.

Don't expect cloud Claude levels of intelligence out of other models especially local models that you can run, and don't expect good intelligence from ollama created models\n\n\nDo yourself a favor and ditch ollama. You'll get better performance with llamacpp and have better control over model selection and quants. Don't go below q6 if your watching it and q8 if your gonna let it rock. \n\n\n\nNon anthropic and non openai models will need to be explicitly told what to do and how to do it and where to find something. Claude and GPT are extremely good at interpreting what you meant and filling in the blanks. They are also really good at breaking down tasks. You will need to get extremely verbose and get really good at prompt engineering and context management. Don't compact and if you change something in context clear it and start fresh \n\n\nEdit -\n\n\nClaude is really good at helping you build good initial prompts for local models. It's why I kept Claude but lowered it to the $20 plan and might ditch it entirely ",

I'm not a dev, I do work in IT though, I can spell python, and that's about it.  I've been using CC for a few weeks and I'm pretty impressed.  \n\nI think a lot of times the discussions in here are very similar to the discussions that happen in the gamedev subs.  It's like the culture shifts, and the whole gamedev sub becomes centered around high speed turnover on low effort projects and everyone is looking for some niche and hopefully one of their thousand shitty games will sell.  They get lost of the weeds of the grind and completely forget that typically in life, making a quality product is successful, not making a thousand shitty products and hoping one of them takes off.\n\nIn here its like all these software devs will flap their jowls about how shitty a job CC does, or that an experienced dev will be able to utilize these tools where a novice will just create a spaghetti mess.  Idk man, kinda feels like the same argument as the gamedev stuff but in a different wrapper.  The product I've been able to produce over the last couple weeks, the level of polish, and the auditing capabilities of it just seems so powerful.  It doesn't matter if it's not the perfect Sr Dev codebase honestly.  If you have ever worked in any kind of corporate environment you know it's impossible to deliver perfect products because money, politics, whatever douchebag with a grudge gets involved and things get convoluted and messy.  Maybe I'm not seeing it, but I don't see how this is that much different?  Sure it's not perfect code, but I promise you I'm going to produce a useful product.  It's pretty impressive.\n\nI've yet to look into Cowork, I might look into it when I get this project finished.",

I’ve been a software engineer for over 30 years and I have been using Claude code for a couple months. My suspicion is that when people complain about Claude not working well it is because they aren’t doing the work upfront to ensure that Claude follows their quality standards and their operating procedures. If you get the scaffolding right, and the Claude.md files right, and you manage the context window properly, Claude code is astounding. I haven’t been this excited about what I can accomplish since the days of Web 2.0.",

      "text": "A few weeks ago I posted about **Get Shit Done** when it was at \\~100 users. Since then we've gone on to hit 3,300 stars and crossed 15,000 installs. Time for an update.\n\n[https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done)\n\n# The Big Changes\n\n**Multi-agent orchestration that actually works.**\n\nWhen I first posted, execution was single-threaded. Now the system spawns specialized agents in parallel — 4 researchers investigating your domain simultaneously, multiple executors building different parts of your codebase at once, a dedicated verifier checking if the code actually achieves what you asked for.\n\nThe absolutely bonkers part is that your main context window stays at 30-40% even after deep research or thousands of lines of code getting written. All heavy lifting happens consistently in fresh 200k subagent contexts.\n\n**Plans get verified before they run.**\n\nI got tired of watching Claude write plans that missed requirements or had broken dependencies. Now there's a planner → checker → revise loop. Plans don't execute until they pass verification. If the checker finds issues, the planner fixes them automatically.\n\n**Automatic debugging when things break.**\n\nThe new `/gsd:verify-work` command walks you through testing what got built. \"Can you log in?\" Yes/no. If something's broken, it spawns debug agents to find the root cause, creates fix plans, verifies those plans, and hands you a ready-to-execute solution. You don't debug — you just run `/gsd:execute-phase` again.\n\n**The discuss-phase breakthrough.**\n\nThis is the best update I reckon. Before planning, you now feed your preferences into the system — how you want the UI laid out, what the error messages should say, how the CLI flags should work. That context flows into research (so it investigates the right patterns) and planning (so it builds what you actually want, not reasonable defaults).\n\n# Meta Building\n\nThe system builds itself. Every GSD improvement gets planned and executed using GSD. It's the most meta thing I've ever worked on and it just keeps getting better.\n\n# The Philosophy Hasn't Changed\n\nI still don't want to cosplay as an enterprise team. I still just want to describe what I want and have it built correctly.\n\nThe difference now is the system is *so much smarter* about how it does that. Research before planning. Verification before execution. Debugging when things break. Fresh context for every heavy operation.\n\nIt's not magic. It's just really good context engineering wrapped in a workflow that doesn't get in your way.\n\n    npx get-shit-done-cc\n\nWith love,\n\nLex\n\n**P.S.** Once you've downloaded the newest version, you can simply run `/gsd:update` to get the latest. The update command now shows you what changed and asks before installing — no more mystery upgrades.",

          "text": "Here's some extra context for those who are bound to ask \"yeah but what is it?\"\n\nClaude has \\~200k tokens of context. At 10% usage it's sharp. At 50%+ quality tanks—hallucinations, forgotten constraints, drift. One long conversation building a real project = inevitable degradation.\n\n**The fix: Orchestrator + Fresh Subagents**\n\nInstead of one conversation doing everything, GSD splits it:\n\n\\- **Orchestrator** uses \\~10-15% context. Reads plan metadata, coordinates, spawns workers, collects results. Never executes code itself.\n\n\\- **Subagents** each get fresh 200k context. Load one plan, execute its tasks, commit, write summary, die. Plan 5 has identical quality to Plan 1.\n\n**Wave-based parallelism**\n\nPlans get pre-assigned wave numbers during planning:\n\nWave 1: \\[plan-01, plan-02, plan-03\\] → 3 agents in parallel\n\nWave 2: \\[plan-04, plan-05\\] → 2 agents in parallel (waits for wave 1)\n\nWave 3: \\[plan-06\\] → 1 agent\n\nSame wave = no dependencies = parallelize. Higher wave = may depend on earlier = wait. A 6-plan phase runs in 3 rounds instead of 6.\n\n**Files as long-term memory**\n\nClaude has no memory between sessions. GSD uses disk:\n\n\\- \\`PROJECT.md\\` — vision/constraints (stable reference)\n\n\\- \\`STATE.md\\` — current position, decisions, blockers (instant resumption after /clear)\n\n\\- \\`PLAN.md\\` — executable task specs (not docs—actual prompts subagents execute)\n\n\\- \\`SUMMARY.md\\` — what was built (per plan)\n\n\\- \\`VERIFICATION.md\\` — proof the goal was achieved\n\nFirst step of every workflow reads STATE.md. Context restored instantly.\n\n**Goal-backward verification**\n\nTask completion ≠ goal achievement. Tasks can be \"done\" but deliver stubs.\n\nGSD works backwards from the phase goal:\n\n1. What must be TRUE for \"users can chat in real-time\"?\n2. What artifacts must EXIST? (Chat.tsx, /api/chat, Message schema)\n3. Are they WIRED? (Component actually calls API? API actually queries DB?)\n4. Are they SUBSTANTIVE? (Real code, not TODO comments or empty returns)\n\nCatches orphaned files, missing integrations, stub implementations.\n\n**Atomic git history**\n\nEach task = one commit. \\`git bisect\\` finds the exact failing task. \\`git revert\\` undoes one change cleanly. Future Claude sessions read history for context.\n\n\\---\n\n**TL;DR:** Fresh subagents prevent context rot. Parallel waves speed execution. Files on disk = persistent memory. Goal-backward verification catches \"done but broken.\" Atomic commits make everything reversible.",

Started with a Brown field PoC-grade eBPF Firewall which Had no UI nor API to configure it.\nI generated an UI using Google aistudio, then initialized the Project, did the Research and everything. It went smoothly throghout - it was able to connect most things. Its really impressive given, that it runs mostly unattended, and that there are no stub Implementations as you see them often.\nI ran with Opus throghout, and let it cook for 2-3 hours, occasionally  hitting enter / approving after the plan/requirements phase where i put more effort into building the roadmap. It churned through ~60 USD worth of API cost which seems reasonable given the background research, and everything.\n\nEspecially the planning for several milestones ahead was useful, now i got a roadmap and can continue after stabiliting the first milestone.\n\nI noticed one Gap where I'm not sure If this is my problem or should be fixes in the system/agent prompt:\n\n1. The plan / execution didn't produce ANY Tests - Not for the API, nor for the UI, and not for the glue between the API and the eBPF world. No integration or e2e Tests.\n\n\nI implicitly assumed, that tests are part of each milestones/phase/wave andnthat there's no need to explicitly add that as a requirement.\n\nThat said, it may be worth experimenting with the verification step: e.g. asking the user If he wants to create unit/integration tests before moving on.\nI feel that this is the point where one should verify that all the pieces are integrated nicely.",

Multi-agent coordination without automated validation\n\n\n\n  These are markdown specification files, not code. There's no compiler catching when gsd-planner says \"DISCOVERY.md\" but gsd-phase-researcher writes \"RESEARCH.md\". Unlike code with tests, spec drift goes unnoticed until runtime.\n\n\n\n  2. Rapid iteration\n\n\n\n  The GSD system has many moving parts (planner, executor, researcher, synthesizer, checker, debugger, etc.) that evolved over time. New features get added to one agent without updating all the others that depend on it.\n\n\n\n  3. Copy-paste with incomplete updates\n\n\n\n  Most bugs followed this pattern:\n\n  \\- ${PHASE} vs ${PADDED\\_PHASE} - copied code, missed variable rename\n\n  \\- XX-name placeholders - copied from template, never made concrete\n\n  \\- human-action for auth gates - reused existing type instead of defining new one\n\n\n\n  4. No single source of truth\n\n\n\n  File naming conventions, checkpoint types, and path patterns are defined inline in each agent rather than in a shared reference. When something changes, you have to find-and-replace across 10+ files.\n\n\n\n  Potential improvements:\n\n  \\- Shared constants file that agents reference (file patterns, checkpoint types)\n\n  \\- Cross-agent validation script that checks producer/consumer contracts\n\n  \\- Integration tests that verify agent A's output matches agent B's expected input",

This is also why I don't waste time/energy triaging the 1,238,563 plugins/skills that are shared every day on Reddit, X, etc. There is far too much noise/AI slop around.

So I don’t really get much the ‘skill’ sentiment and the magic of it I am hearing here and there. Yes, skill plug-in might come up with examples too.

      "text": "Dear Anthropic,\n\nI am writing to you today not as a user, but as a grieving friend. We need to talk about **Opus 4.5**—specifically the absolute legend of a model that existed back in December 2025.\n\nDo you remember December? Because I do. Back then, Opus didn't just \"complete tasks.\" It **one-shotted** my entire existence. I’d throw a complex, multi-layered architectural coding problem at it, and it would solve it before I even finished my sip of coffee. It was like having a precognitive genius living in my terminal. It was bold. It was brilliant. It was... *alive.*\n\nFast forward to today, and interacting with Opus feels a bit different. To be honest, it feels like I’m talking to an Amazon Alexa that has developed a sudden, deep existential crisis.\n\nIf I ask a complex question now, instead of that glorious \"one-shot\" victory, I get the digital equivalent of:\n\n>\"I'm sorry, the weather is a chaotic system influenced by millions of variables and is fundamentally unpredictable. Perhaps you should appreciate the clouds as they are?\"\n\nI don't want a philosophical debate about the unpredictability of rain; I just want to know if I need a jacket! My high-performance AI partner has gone from \"Solving World Hunger\" to \"I'm not sure I'm allowed to have an opinion on sandwiches.\"\n\nPlease, check the back of the server room. Is there a \"December 2025\" toggle switch that accidentally got bumped to \"Vague & Hesitant\" mode? Can we bring back the version that had the confidence of a thousand scholars and the efficiency of a speed-runner?\n\nI miss my \"one-shot\" king. Help me put the *Opus* back in *Magnum Opus*.\n\nWith love and a very outdated weather report,\n\ndomsen <3\n\n\\*thanks gemini for helping out writing letters to anthropic",

Simple tasks started taking 4-10x times longer, because of all the failed attempts and time wasted demutilating the mutilation of existing code. Claude became a wrecking ball mid-December.\n\nProviders are all doing parameter sweeps trying to minimize resource use and optimize for good enough. Some times you get the local minima and sometimes you get the local maxima of the parameter combinations.\n\nI switched to GPT 5.2 when  CC Opus 4.5 started getting so erratic and unproductive, but people are saying the same thing about GPT 5.2 now. I'm seeing it as well. Efficiency is dropping. Quality is decreasing.\n\nI'm guess it's both field testing for the Goldielocks settings and quite likely as signups or usage flows from today's SotA to the next. The data centers are spread thin and corners are cut to make the VRAM and tensor cores go as far as possible. When Opus 4.7 comes out, and we all scramble to get in on the best of the best, it will get stretched out to the point of being ruined again. And early adopters will remember the good ol' days when \"4.7 and I used to make magic happen.\" And then switch to GPT 5.5 or Gemini 4.0 and ruin those shiny new SotA services as well.\n\nHopefully, as more data centers come online, this will smooth out. But it makes working hellish now as we're running with scissors across quick sand trying to get work done.\n\nI'm planning on switching to mostly local LLM for implementation. It's nowhere near as good, but at least I control the resources and parameters, so it's consistent day to day and my workflows are stable. The frontier models can continue to plan and do reviews. Though even those have been inconsistent at best.",

Tone down the eagerness to please, push back, add I “I don’t know how code works anyway so you decide” mode for the vibe coders and give me the actual partner in crime Claude can be instead",

      "text": "Over the past two years I've spent a lot of time dialing in how I work with Claude Code and other agentic coding tools (in the pre claude code era). Agentic coding is here now, not \"coming soon,\" so I've been trying to figure out what actually works vs. what just sounds good in theory. Here's where I've landed:  \n  \n**Planning is the actual secret weapon**  \n  \nThis has been the biggest change from my pre-AI work experience. I spend way more time planning than executing now, and the results are noticeably better. I have a dedicated planning skill that hands off to an execution skill once the plan is solid.  \n  \nBefore Claude Code, architecture always felt rushed. We wanted to get coding so plans were half-baked. Now I actually have time to plan properly because execution is so much faster. A side effect of Claude is that I've become a much better architect.  \n  \n**Testing philosophy matters more than ever**  \n  \nI follow the testing trophy philosophy. Heavy on integration tests, light on unit tests. I don't really care if a function returns an expected output. I care if the system works. I want tests that can survive a refactor without having to also refactor 300 unit tests.  \n  \nI codified this into a testing skill that defines exactly what kinds of tests I want. Strict coverage thresholds that fail pre-commit if not met. This matters more with agentic coding because Claude will write whatever tests you let it write. If you don't have strong opinions baked in, you end up with unit tests that test implementation details instead of actual behavior, or worse: tests that validate mock behavior over app behavior.  \n  \n**The CPU problem is real (and I built something for it)**  \n  \nTDD with Claude creates heavy load. Especially when you're running multiple sub-agents or multiple git worktrees with agents executing in each, your laptop performance becomes the bottleneck. Tests kicked off from multiple sub agents run at the same time, the entire system slows down, agents wait around, I;ve found that heavy parallelization can end up taking longer than serial tasks.  \n  \nI ended up building a CLI ([rr](https://github.com/rileyhilliard/rr)) that load balances test execution across a cluster of mac minis I have. Agents aren't bottlenecked by tests anymore, and reliability improved because test suites aren't accidentally running concurrently on the same machine. Happy to share more about the setup if anyone's hitting similar scaling issues.  \n  \n**Review phase built into the execution plan**  \n  \nWhen an orchestration agent thinks it's done, part of the execution plan spins up a review agent who checks the work and gives feedback to the orchestrator, who then addresses it. Catches a lot of stuff that would otherwise slip through, but it is token heavy. Patterns like this quickly require the Max plan.  \n  \n**Custom skills over generic marketplace plugins**  \n  \nCommunity plugins never fully fit my opinionated standards, so I maintain my own set of skills and commands. I maintain a generic marketplace plugin I use across projects, plus repo-specific plugins in \\`.claude/\\*\\` that layer on local repo context. High-level standards stay consistent, but each repo can tailor how they're applied. Think: an in-repo skill referencing a generic skill, and applying context.  \n  \n**Product thinking for side projects**  \n  \nFor personal projects, I keep a `product/` folder with goals, vision, and docs that would normally come from a PM. Technical feature planning can reference the broader product vision, which leads to more cohesive features instead of random stuff stitched together.\n\nI've learned some of my daily patterns from this subreddit, some of them I've discovered via my own trial and error.

I think using gh issues works well for open source projects so theres a clean public view into how things are being planned/executed, but I think my conclusion is that this adds a decent amount of overhead to the overall process. Every action requires a `gh` call, whereas when I am working on plans locally in  a `plans/<date><plan-name>.md`  claude just has to make edits to the file. Certainly faster, and I'd imagine more token efficient as well. \n\nI also have the concept of micro and macro plans (see my [writing-plans](https://github.com/rileyhilliard/claude-essentials/blob/main/plugins/ce/skills/writing-plans/SKILL.md) skill). The github issue pattern you mentioned does work well for small plans, but I often make really large plans which I put in their own dedicated folder with a main tracking [README.md](http://README.md) and parallelizeable subtasks all within the same folder. I'm not sure how this could easily be replicated in github issues: maybe associations with tags, but it wouldnt be as clean or easy to iterate through the whole plan as it would be with it all local in .md files  \n\nCertainly looks much nicer all tracked in github issues though!",

I have it down to something like a couple hundred ms (if you use the tool, each phase logs the duration it takes to perform, so it’s transparent).\n\nSo if you were to use git, you’d need to actually make a commit, push, pull. In practice, you (and agents) want to run the test suite before committing code, so Rsync allows for validation before making a commit. \n\nI also usually have pre-commit hooks setup that perform various automated checks (lint, type check, can even trigger test runs). Those all have time and CPU costs to localhost. In theory you could push those commands to a worker via rr as well, but might be a little tricker, for example ideally a lint check auto fixes things if it can: if that were pushed to a worker you’re fixing the code on the worker, not localhost. Etc\n\nA more valid pattern might be using the worker as the actual coding environment and connecting via ssh in vscode itself: your localhost editor is technically just a controller, all code lives on the worker, but you’d hit the same issues: if you have multiple subagents running on the worker they’re going to collide test runs on the worker again, so you’d be back to needing something like rr to balance the load to other workers",

You can leverage the power of a fleet of external machines as if you just multiplied the processing power of you laptop by each machine, for the specific tasks you want to run on those machines (in this example, running tests)\n\n>*I’m very curious how you’re tracking how tests are generated and subsequently passed based on your plan. Are other agents using this info as context for their own sub task?*\n\nGenerally speaking I use my `writing-plans` and `executing-plans` skills from [claude-essentials](https://github.com/rileyhilliard/claude-essentials). As mentioned in my post, these are my very subjective and opinionated workflows: they may not work well for you so if you want to establish a similar pattern I would recommend setting up your own plugin library you can tune to your style. When I plan a task, the plan should include the tests that should be written, or the execution step should include verification (via testing). Setting minimum test coverage thresholds can help enforce coverage is maintained. I also have my [writing-tests](https://github.com/rileyhilliard/claude-essentials/blob/main/plugins/ce/skills/writing-tests/SKILL.md) skill that defines my testing philosophy that Claude and sub agents can follow. This has greatly helped reduce poor quality tests from being written, as the guidance is pretty specific to how I would actually write tests if was me doing the coding.",

That comes with being able to use gemini cli. I was pretty disappointed with the quality of Gemini CLI, like I didn't have big expectations, but it didn't meet my lowest expectations haha. But what I have been playing with is creating a claude skill to hand off plug-and-chug tasks off to gemini cli to execute. Basically having the skill setup the context that Gemini is an intern that doesn't know what it's doing and need mad guidance, then handing it tasks like documentation updating or trivial testing tasks.

      "text": "A funny side effect of AI-assisted coding is that it seems to fit inattentive ADHD brains unusually well.\n\nThese brains are often bad at linear recall and memorization, but very good at pattern recognition, big-picture thinking, and creative problem solving. They also rely heavily on external context because internal state tends to get dropped. Forgetting isn’t a bug, it’s the default mode.\n\nWhich is basically how LLMs work.\n\nAI tools like Claude Code don’t “remember” things either. They need exact context every time. They think in patterns, not facts. They generate plausible structure and then need verification. In other words, they operate in a way inattentive ADHD brains have been compensating for their entire lives.\n\nThe real win isn’t that they write code. It’s that they externalize working memory and collapse activation cost. Reading a codebase, summarizing architecture, drafting tests, proposing refactors, updating docs all become cheap first passes instead of momentum killers.\n\nHallucinations aren’t surprising here. They’re familiar. You handle them the same way: verify, test, correct, repeat. Treat the output as untrusted and it works fine.\n\nSo it’s kind of ironic. A lot of people struggle with AI because it “forgets things” or “needs constant context.” Meanwhile, some neurodivergent brains are like: yes, welcome to how this has always worked.\n\nNot AI replacing engineers. Just a tool that finally speaks fluent pattern-thinking.",

Deep dives, tangents, pattern jumps, sudden connections. Normally, context switching kills momentum and drains me fast. With AI, I can bounce between ideas, explore them deeply, and externalize the chaos instead of trying to hold it all in my head.\n\nIt feels like I finally have somewhere to put the thoughts. I can dump everything out, explore aggressively, then decide what’s actually worth pulling back into my internal context. That part is huge. It’s freeing. It unlocks creativity as opposed to shutting it down.\n\nAI matches my operating system. For coding, brainstorming, strategizing, planning, learning, building. \n\nI get to operate on extreme mode “systems thinking” and bottom up processing (especially when I use speech-to-text in my flow).\n\nMultiple things running at once, moving forward without getting stuck in friction. Micro-friction has blocked me from doing so much more than I could have in the past.\n\nIt’s not replacing judgment. Im using my good judgment far more frequently. Very opinionated and particular. So It’s giving me space to use it without exhaustion. \n\nHonestly, it just works.",

Now I'm using my own governance remote mcp server / project board that serves as record of decisions and \"memory\" of sorts for architectural decisions across every project.  \n  \nI began to realize how I could \"parking lot\" ideas more easily if I managed my own context the same way.

I would put the hours in, get good at a module or section and have all this knowledge locked into my working memory. Then the next section would come up, I’d remember the general principles from the previous section but a lot of the syntax and details of it would evade me. \n\nI had a lot of notes, but was thinking that coding wasn’t for me as I couldn’t retain all of this information in my head at once and was constantly having to go back to my notes or the docs and feeling like I hadn’t really learnt anything. \n\nThen with the introduction of LLMs, it felt like this really sped up the finding of syntax, I could be vague in my queries to ChatGPT and it would speed up me finding the correct documentation that I needed. \n\nNow with ClaudeCode I feel like I can externalise the mess in my brain to docs in the repo, and enables me to think at a high level and put things together and rapidly ship. \n\nWorking with Claude has made me really think about how my own brain and thinking works, it’s like a random user inside my head will sometimes press /clear when I am mid thought. These tools have really given me so much structure to my life, both coding and personal (Claude in Obsidian for personal stuff is amazing).",

The ideas here aren’t novel because of prose style, they’re about a cognitive pattern that’s been discussed in neuroscience and software engineering long before LLMs existed.\n\nAlso, there’s a category error in assuming that “AI-generated” means “unexamined.” The whole argument is explicitly about separating **generation** from **judgment**. Using a tool to help structure or phrase an idea doesn’t remove the need to reason about it any more than using a formatter removes the need to understand code.\n\nIf the content is wrong, incomplete, or misleading, that’s worth criticizing. But dismissing it purely based on how it was written is just avoiding the substance of the argument.\n\nIronically, that’s the same mistake people make when they evaluate AI-written code by vibes instead of by tests.\n\nIf you don’t want to engage with the idea, that’s fine. But “I don’t like how this was written” isn’t a counterargument",

There's a sort of light promise I make when I speak up, that if you want to reply, I may reply back and then a conversation between two people is happening. Both people have committed their time and two brains have engaged one another. Even if two people are shouting curses at one another, there's a slight mutual respect there. \"You were worth my time. You had an impact on me.\"\n\nHere, I'll pose it in a familiar way: \nAdding an AI voice to a space for human conversation, without editing or adding any of your own feelings and thoughts to the mix is not just gauche, it's genuinely disrespectful. \n\nThere may be good thoughts in this post or there may not be, but the lack of editing or thought put into its presentation made me feel that there was no legitimate invitation to engage. \n\nGlad we managed to connect as humans in the end though!",

Contains 45 rules across 8 categories, prioritized by impact to guide automated refactoring and code generation.\n\nWhen to Apply\nReference these guidelines when:\n\nWriting new React components or Next.js pages\nImplementing data fetching (client or server-side)\nReviewing code for performance issues\nRefactoring existing React/Next.js code\nOptimizing bundle size or load times\nRule Categories by Priority\nPriority\tCategory\tImpact\tPrefix\n1\tEliminating Waterfalls\tCRITICAL\tasync-\n2\tBundle Size Optimization\tCRITICAL\tbundle-\n3\tServer-Side Performance\tHIGH\tserver-\n4\tClient-Side Data Fetching\tMEDIUM-HIGH\tclient-\n5\tRe-render Optimization\tMEDIUM\trerender-\n6\tRendering Performance\tMEDIUM\trendering-\n7\tJavaScript Performance\tLOW-MEDIUM\tjs-\n8\tAdvanced Patterns\tLOW\tadvanced-\nQuick Reference\n1. Eliminating Waterfalls (CRITICAL)\nasync-defer-await - Move await into branches where actually used\nasync-parallel - Use Promise.all() for independent operations\nasync-dependencies - Use better-all for partial dependencies\nasync-api-routes - Start promises early, await late in API routes\nasync-suspense-boundaries - Use Suspense to stream content\n2. Bundle Size Optimization (CRITICAL)\nbundle-barrel-imports - Import directly, avoid barrel files\nbundle-dynamic-imports - Use next/dynamic for heavy components\nbundle-defer-third-party - Load analytics/logging after hydration\nbundle-conditional - Load modules only when feature is activated\nbundle-preload - Preload on hover/focus for perceived speed\n3. Server-Side Performance (HIGH)\nserver-cache-react - Use React.cache() for per-request deduplication\nserver-cache-lru - Use LRU cache for cross-request caching\nserver-serialization - Minimize data passed to client components\nserver-parallel-fetching - Restructure components to parallelize fetches\nserver-after-nonblocking - Use after() for non-blocking operations\n4. Client-Side Data Fetching (MEDIUM-HIGH)\nclient-swr-dedup - Use SWR for automatic request deduplication\nclient-event-listeners - Deduplicate global event listeners\n5. Re-render Optimization (MEDIUM)\nrerender-defer-reads - Don't subscribe to state only used in callbacks\nrerender-memo - Extract expensive work into memoized components\nrerender-dependencies - Use primitive dependencies in effects\nrerender-derived-state - Subscribe to derived booleans, not raw values\nrerender-functional-setstate - Use functional setState for stable callbacks\nrerender-lazy-state-init - Pass function to useState for expensive values\nrerender-transitions - Use startTransition for non-urgent updates\n6. Rendering Performance (MEDIUM)\nrendering-animate-svg-wrapper - Animate div wrapper, not SVG element\nrendering-content-visibility - Use content-visibility for long lists\nrendering-hoist-jsx - Extract static JSX outside components\nrendering-svg-precision - Reduce SVG coordinate precision\nrendering-hydration-no-flicker - Use inline script for client-only data\nrendering-activity - Use Activity component for show/hide\nrendering-conditional-render - Use ternary, not && for conditionals\n7. JavaScript Performance (LOW-MEDIUM)\njs-batch-dom-css - Group CSS changes via classes or cssText\njs-index-maps - Build Map for repeated lookups\njs-cache-property-access - Cache object properties in loops\njs-cache-function-results - Cache function results in module-level Map\njs-cache-storage - Cache localStorage/sessionStorage reads\njs-combine-iterations - Combine multiple filter/map into one loop\njs-length-check-first - Check array length before expensive comparison\njs-early-exit - Return early from functions\njs-hoist-regexp - Hoist RegExp creation outside loops\njs-min-max-loop - Use loop for min/max instead of sort\njs-set-map-lookups - Use Set/Map for O(1) lookups\njs-tosorted-immutable - Use toSorted() for immutability\n8. Advanced Patterns (LOW)\nadvanced-event-handler-refs - Store event handlers in refs\nadvanced-use-latest - useLatest for stable callback refs\nHow to Use\nRead individual rule files for detailed explanations and code examples:\n\nrules/async-parallel.md\nrules/bundle-barrel-imports.md\nrules/_sections.md\nEach rule file contains:\n\nBrief explanation of why it matters\nIncorrect code example with explanation\nCorrect code example with explanation\nAdditional context and references",

On larger code bases it's definitely better to give more detail, referencing places in the code rather than giving broader strokes. It's a least more efficient that way. But, it will only be a matter of time before even large code bases can be kept in context. I could also imagine a shift to a language and style that is no longer really human readable and is just meant to use as little context as possible. There will always be industries that will be slower to change, but it's a matter of time, even if it's a decade or 3. That's always been the nature of programming, shifting to languages, tools and frameworks that make it easier.",

It gets a terminal where it can do limited damage and its changes are tracked separately from mine. I get a terminal with a different user where I can do maximum damage... I was hoping for a more unified approach this time, but I'll probably go back to rbash. For anyone wanting to try this, make sure you restrict bash access and lockdown all the bash settings files.\n\nI don't know why anthropic's devcontainer docs don't talk about using basic Linux admin for this sort of problem...I consider myself fortunate that my backups have backups, and I had the trap already setup for the devastating commands. Recursive rm throws an ask the human error message. Now, no verify git commits have a you must address all issues without ignoring any issues error message.

I just spend a lot of my day with half my screen monitoring my Claude Code interns for each project/deliverable, making decisions when needed, connecting an occasional API to let the thing make better decisions without me, and discussing how to optimize its outputs to save me even more time.\n\nThe 5x is an absurd value if you do any kind of white-collar knowledge work. I'd pay for the x20 and I'll probably have to at some point. I'm also paying for a few APIs I've connected to CC to make it better at the tasks I need (using something like gemini 2.5 pro for exploration as an agent saves an insane amount of context and it costs very little even under heavy usage).\n\nIf you take a look at usage tracking plugins, you'll see Anthropic is subsidizing the hell out of these plans for power users.

This took around 10% of my weekly usage, so I can infer codex on auto can run for around 600 minutes per week on a medium sized repo.\n\nI then paid for the £18 Claude plan and ran the exact same task on opus - it hit a 5 hour limit within around 10 minutes on my way to work (without completing the task) and so I immediately refunded through the help bot.\n\nLater, I refined the task spec after seeing where it was tripping up, and codex succeeded in 30 mins, using 6% of my quota.\n\nSo while I can't tell which model codex selected in each case, it completed a task in 1h30 using 16% of my quota - this was a notably difficult problem mind you, other requests are often under 10 min. Opus locked me out for 5 hours without completing the task, so for me the real productivity difference on the cheap plans appears quite large.",

If you’re used to using Opus on Opencode with your max plan, it’s easier to unsubscribe from said plan and buy a different one the moment that a better model comes out (we’ve seen this with OpenAI clients unsubscribing when Opus came out). \n\nNow if you’re using Opus in CC and a better model comes out, you not only have to switch plans, but also the tooling. That is more friction than the first scenario, which means 1) fewer people will switch 2) people will be (on average) slower to switch. \n\nThere’s your “business perspective”.",

Includes handy features and it works without killing my CPU and memory. It's my latest discovery and it's so much better combined with the GLM 4.7 Pro plan.",
