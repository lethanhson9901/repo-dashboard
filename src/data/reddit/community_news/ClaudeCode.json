      "text": "I've written 500k+ lines of code with Claude Code in the past 90 days.\n\nHere's what I learned:\n\n* Use a monorepo (crucial for context management)\n* Use modular routing to map frontend features to your backend (categorize API routes by their functionality and put them in separate files). This minimizes context pollution\n* Use a popular stack and popular libraries with older versions (React, FastAPI, Python, etc). LLMs are less likely to make mistakes when writing code that they've already seen in their training data\n* Once your code is sufficiently modularized, write SKILL files explaining how to implement each \"module\" in your architecture. For example, one skill could be dedicated to explaining how to write a modular API route in your codebase\n* Mention in your CLAUDE file to include comments at the top of every file it creates explaining concisely what the file does. This helps Claude navigate your codebase more autonomously in fresh sessions\n* Use an MCP that gives Claude read only access to the database. This helps it debug autonomously\n* Spend a few minutes planning how to implement a feature. Once you're ok with the high level details, let Claude implement it E2E in bypass mode\n* Use test driven development where possible. Make sure you add unit tests for every feature that is added and have them run in GitHub on every pull request. I use testcontainers to run tests against a dummy postgres container before every pull request is merged\n* Run your frontend and backend in tmux so that Claude can easily tail logs when needed (tell it to do this in your CLAUDE file)\n* Finally, if you're comfortable with all of the above, use multiple worktrees and have agents running in parallel. I sometimes use 3-4 worktrees in parallel\n\nAbove all - don't forget to properly review the code you generate. Vibe reviewing is a more accurate description of what you should be doing - not vibe coding. In my experience, it is critical to be aware of the entire codebase at the abstraction of functions. You should at minimum know where every function lives and in which file in your codebase.\n\nCurious to hear how other people have been using Claude.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zpffsbed3s9g1.png?width=560&format=png&auto=webp&s=d74579b664c408f068ec0a220b7582986480a89f\n\n",

Presumably, this kind of thing exists for even smaller niches.\n\n> *Use an MCP that gives Claude read only access to the database.

This skill tells Claude where to place the files in the codebase and what the class should look like, etc. Since the code is heavily modularized now, you have to tell it what the registry points are (this is a common theme with modular code) to properly use a newly created file. All of this context goes into the skill so it can properly implement the handler/routes. You can think of this as one \"module\" (a module is a group of similar API routes in this case).  \n\\- **Implementing tests for a handler** \\- Since you're breaking down API routes into separate files, you also want to break down tests into different flies. I have 1-2 test files for each handler file/group of API routes I implement. There's a skill for this that explains how the mocking system is set up and how to properly mock API routes and write high quality tests for each handler file. If your testing architecture is sophisticated enough a lot of context will have to be put in here so that it can play well with all your mocks.  \n\\- **Socket event creator** \\- I have a socket driven architecture so I also have a skill file explaining where to register socket events and where to write the pydantic classes for it.",

Frontend and backend developer? How about a singular developer agent perhaps specialist for specific use-cases like testing. Nobody wants front-end backend split in real companies. The best engineers are those that can do both.\n\nAs far as testing goes, there are is no such thing because almost nobody (in the grand scheme of things in 2025) that use evals for their production systems let alone for their coding agents that are put together in a haphazard way.\n\nThe best way as usual is simplification and working it out from actual real use-cases - not some hypotetical over-engineered scenario.",

If I want a new feature, I can ask for the feature and each thing I need for that feature now has a clear set of guidelines that I want followed. So the game research agent looks up game mechanics relating to genre. The ui agent looks up best practices and does its own research, etc and the manager agent takes those answers and decides how best to implement them as a whole into the game. It then passes results to a documentation agent who update all the documentation and logs. \n\nThe manager AI, or user I guess, can get extremely well defined answers and it's a lot easier to maintain as separate files than in one single one, for me at least.\n\nPlease fill it full of holes.

It really depends on the company size and type. But even with big companies it is a well established facts that multiple levels of management is a bad practice and it should be avoided. In fact, at very successful companies like Valve engineers are required to deal with customers first-hand. I bet that your backend agent can answer better a customer support request than the distilled version (basically version without deeper levels of context) that the support agent received from some bare-bone information from the top manager agent.\n\nI mean, we have our own AI company and we work with real customers and I can tell you that nothing of this sorts actually works in real systems. You don't need 50 different agents with different responsibilities because context can be dynamically extended and contracted as the task is progressed from one step to the next.\n\nThe best way is usually to model the agents after some real use-case which will guide the architecture.\n\nI mean look at Claude Code, Copilot, etc., while they certainly encourage you to break everything up into smaller agent their own coding agent does not work like that at all. It is a singular thing that you can use to write any type of code and write any type of article. It works in general way - this is the whole point of AI - and those are actually tested in various benchmarks.\n\nJust to be clear, task-specific agents are a thing. We use them all the time. But not in some sort of structured configuration. They are used kind of like tools.",

You can actually map the agent specifically to CPU course, especially if you’re running MCPs to make sure that they don’t know whose context because your resources are strapped to the max you can even split two smaller agents that may only delegate for for example to a single core.

          "text": "This guy Dex Horthy and his YCombinator-backed startup Humanlayer basically came out of nowhere this spring and he has somehow immediately catapulted himself to the top of the food chain as one of the industry's most-influential voices on \"context engineering\" for AI Agents. You might've heard the term \"12 Factor Agents\" being thrown around at some point this year, he's the one who coined that term and many other terms that are now being widely used across the industry.\n\nThis random girl's quick [blog](https://medium.com/@ashleyha/i-mastered-the-claude-code-workflow-145d25e502cf) on how to user their agent-based workflow was how I first got introduced to HumanLayer. It's a decent quick crash course that shows you the basics of how to use their agentic workflow.\n\nThey also have a really cool App called CodeLayer (100% free and open source) that you don't need to use, but you should use. They call it the \"post-IDE IDE\" because it's basically just an IDE that's custom made just for Claude Code sessions. Most importantly: your Claude Code sessions no longer have that annoying flickering/rendering problem in the terminal.\n\nTo give you some perspective: I've been using their workflow for 1-2 months and I'm currently building things in an afternoon that would've taken me 1-2 weeks using Cursor 3 months ago. And it's not AI slop either, it's tested/verified production-grade code.\n\nYou can download their agents/slash-commands from the .claude/ folder of https://github.com/humanlayer/humanlayer. I'd recommend copying them to the global ~/.claude/ folder so you don't need to re-copy them to each project. I'd also recommend installing their npm CLI, and adding the ./hack/spec_metadata.sh file to your project (WITH THE SAME RELATIVE PATH, DON'T CHANGE IT) but it's not explicitly required.\n\nEvery single day, I read 20+ headlines like \"This AI coding tool changes EVERYTHING\", \"These AI coding agents will change your life\", etc. HumanLayer's agentic workflow is the only tool I've come across that I can actually say was genuinely life changing. There's more to learn than what's in the blog post I added, but that'll teach you 80% of the essentials in 20 minutes.\n\nThey also have a Discord server worth checking out.",

It seems to only be working for MacOS, but not Linux/Windows\n```\n\nSaves a file to ./thoughts/shared/research/12-26-2025-app-auto-updater.md\n\n```\n/create_plan thoughts/shared/research/12-26-2025-app-auto-updater.md The auto-updater only works for MacOS. We need to make the auto-updater cross-platform.\n```\n\nSaves a file to ./thoughts/shared/plans/12-26-2025-cross-platform-auto-updater.md\n\n```\n/implement_plan thoughts/shared/plans/12-26-2025-cross-platform-auto-updater.md Phase 1 only\n```\n\nLLM executes automated tests and gives user a list of manual tests to verify the phase was successful.\n\nThis is sort of frowned upon, but I usually just tell Claude to write me a shell script that executes the manual tests one by one and I copy the chunks piece-by-piece into the terminal. This is much faster than making tests yourself and almost never fails for me, so I think the risk/efficiency tradeoff is worth it.\n\nRepeat this ^ part for all plan phases and just change the message from Phase 1 only -> Phase 2 only, etc.\n\nSome additional commands that aren't part of the workflow but are super helpful:\n\nUse this when the plan needs to be changed in some way after you already started implementing phases.\n\n```\n/iterate_plan thoughts/shared/plans/12-26-2025-cross-platform-auto-updater.md PackageNameXYZ has had a lot of problems when running it from Ubuntu's default package manager. Let's use homebrew as the Linux package manager instead. Copy the files from the mac_installer to linux_installer and then modify them to work for Linux.\n```\n\n***SUPER IMPORTANT***\nLLM performance falls apart (any model, not just claude) once context window reaches roughly 60%. Always start a new session when you get close to this. Less than 40% context means you can still give your agent much more context about your codebase and you're underutilizing the context window.\n\nThe handoff document basically writes you a markdown doc to onboard the next session's agent so we can pick up exactly where we left off with all the right context to equip your agent to get started on the next planned phase.\n\n```\n/create_handoff\n```\n\nThis ^ will create the doc and then print a command you can copy/paste at the start of the next session. Use it if your context window gets too full before you complete the plan:\n\n```\n /resume_handoff thoughts/shared/general/handoffs/12-26-2025-name-of-my-handoff.md\n```\n\nThese are the basics that'll get you started once you copy the .claude/ dir files from humanlayer into your user/project claude folder.",

      "text": "ADHD, simplified: your brain's \"just do it\" mechanism is broken. You can want something, know it's important, and still be physically unable to start. Not laziness, more like a disconnection between intention and action.\n\nNow to my story.\n\nI've been working 12 hours a day on the same project for two months. For me, that's unusual, not the intensity (I can hyperfocus), but the *consistency*. My projects usually stall at some point when the boring parts remain. This time I pushed through. The only thing that changed: I started using Claude Code.\n\nQuick context: 42, tech lead. Lifelong struggle with what looks like \"procrastination\" but feels like physical inability to start or finish tasks. Can stare at my screen for hours knowing I need to work, unable to open the right file. Creative problem-solving captures me completely. Maintenance work triggers something close to physical resistance.\n\nSo what's different now?\n\nStarting used to be the hardest part. Loading the project architecture into my head, remembering where everything lives, figuring out the first step, I'd lose hours just trying to begin. Now I describe what needs doing, Claude finds the files, proposes an approach. The blank screen paralysis is gone.\n\nThere's also the memory problem. I forget what I coded an hour ago, how the pieces connect. Claude holds that context for me, remembers yesterday's architectural decisions. I stopped trying to keep everything in my head and just focus on whatever's in front of me right now.\n\nSolo coding when i'm not in hyperfocus meant fighting my attention every 10-15 minutes. The wandering, the cigarette breaks. With Claude there's actual back-and-forth, asking, responding, iterating. Conversation keeps my brain in the room in a way that staring at code alone never did.\n\nAnd the boring stuff that usually kills my projects - boilerplate, refactoring, repetitive debugging? Claude takes most of it. I stay on the interesting parts. The resistance is still there but it's not project-ending anymore.\n\nHere's what I didn't expect though, and it might matter more than everything above.\n\nI used to have a natural stopping mechanism. Hit a hard bug, brain stops working, try different angles, eventually realize I'm done for the day, go to sleep, solution appears in the morning. Those walls were frustrating but they forced me to rest.\n\nNow those moments are rare. Stuck on something? Ask Claude. He suggests an approach I hadn't considered. Keep working. There's almost always a way forward *right now*.\n\nThe 12 hours a day isn't some amazing flow state. It's that I can keep working even when exhausted because Claude compensates exactly where I'd normally hit a wall. I work until I'm falling asleep at my desk instead of stopping when my brain signals it's done.\n\nNot sure if that's a feature or a bug.\n\nCould be correlation. Maybe the project is just interesting, maybe it's tool novelty wearing off slowly, maybe I'm in a lucky productive stretch. But it feels like specific barriers got removed, not like I suddenly became more disciplined.",

              "text": "Same boat here.  I worked on ML at big tech fang, got high ratings, was the point person for difficult to debug issues, or complex design problems. But all my work came in bursts of flow/fugue-state after weeks or months of procrastination.\n\nI've had the same issue from elementary to grad school: graduated magna cum laude from a well known uni, but I would have extreme debilitating levels of procrastination until crunch time.  I remember many times I would put an alarm at 4am in order to start preparing for an 8am exam.  This is after procrastinating for weeks.  And it's like not like I did anything productive during that time either, I would spend the entire time convincing myself that I need to study, cancelling all my other life plans, only to DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING until a few hours before a due date.  \n\nI've held this pattern in my entire life.  While I have been successful career wise and financially (grew up poor), it has completely ruined me from a social perspective. I'm in my early 40s now.  It was always been: \"I need to X before I can do anything else with my life, but let's procrastinate on X for weeks/months\".\n\nAfter discovering CC, I quit my job recently in order to start my own company, as this negative-feedback loop had reached a fever pitch. I could not for the life of me go through another OKR or perf cycle at big tech.  I've been able to do in a few short weeks what would have taken many people and several months at my prior company.\n\nNow, I'm never blocked, all the grungy stuff: claude takes over (pip package conflicts? let claude take of it; write load test or simulator to see what DAU I can scale to with the current arch? let claude take care of it; intricate and annoying ML preprocessing pipeline? write two paragraphs and let claude take care of;  need to find optimal batch parameters for my ML model? two sentences, and 2 minutes later, I have throughput numbers for a whole set of batch params.)\n\nTedious things that would take weeks finish are done in 15 minutes.  It is absolutely insane.\n\nIt has allowed me focus on the difficult, interesting, and ambiguous parts of the problem.  I launch in a few months, so I'm hoping this works out, as it has the potential to completely reverse the negative feedback loop I've been struggling with my entire life.\n\nAnother massive benefit, is that I skip a lot of the MVP code.  Why bother with a simple Docker container on a VPS, when I can set up a k8 environment with autoscaling, staging env, canary, prometheus, grafana, etc in less than a week's effort?  I usually experiment many different approaches, load test for scalability targets that I am after, then integrate the best solution for my needs into my production stack.  I go into every major decision with so much more data now.  Why deal with scalability/usability issues later, when it's so easy to experiment and load-test/simulate every decision?",

This is always where the ADHD / OCD brain makes going further impossible. \n\nThere's never code without issues. And sometimes a basic sweep of the UX or logic comes up with something so obviously stupid that I didn't catch that I then second guess the whole code base.\n\nThere has been things that I ship and people find them very useful. There's been things that I myself use and find insanely useful. But I think it's a form of imposter syndrome that even something 95% perfect isn't quite good enough if I'm using these tools.\n\nDo you just accept that some bugs will happen and fix them as they're reported?",

And that's where things got difficult. Code reviews, task distribution, calls... after a meeting I'd just want to stare at the ceiling for hours. Holding in my head what everyone's doing, answering questions, context-switching constantly. Total overload.\n\nI found a workaround that worked for years: built teams where we discuss strategy at a high level every week or two, then they execute. I stay on architecture and direction, they handle implementation. Let me function as tech lead without drowning in details.\n\nWith Claude Code I accidentally got the same pattern, but for solo work. We discuss tasks at a high level, he does the details. Available anytime, switches contexts instantly, remembers everything about the project. And I interact through chat instead of exhausting calls.\n\nWhat's more, calls with my actual team got more interesting. Before, I'd come to daily sync with whatever progress I managed between coordination. Now I come with a massive amount of work that would otherwise take a week. We discuss everything at a higher level, architecture, direction, integration, which comes much easier to me than diving into implementation details of every task.\n\nThe problem is I don't know how to come up for air.\n\nTwo months of 12-hour days is new for me. Usually deep focus lasts a few days max before interest fades or I hit a wall or burn out. Now those natural stopping points are gone. Claude removes technical blockers, eliminates coordination overhead, keeps things interesting through constant back-and-forth.\n\nMy partner notices I'm less present. Friends get short replies instead of real conversations. Everything outside work falls out of view. Same rigid focus problem I've always had, just amplified because there's nothing that makes me say \"enough for today.\"",

And in programming there's no such thing as \"done.\" Finished one feature? There's a hundred more ahead. Always something next. Claude Code just shifted the balance from \"hard to start\" to \"hard to stop.\"\n\nSame thing happens with hobbies actually.

I've been ruminating on your post and eventually it hit me, I know the answer and I really don't like it myself but it's simple.

Back then I thought I was just lazy and disorganized, would never achieve anything. But then it turned out programming and building things was interesting to me. Some pet projects I made for fun became popular, others turned into businesses, and my self-esteem eventually leveled out.\n\nLuckily, maybe thanks to high IQ or being wired for creating rather than consuming, I didn't get stuck in typical traps. Games got boring eventually, and the other ADHD pitfall, endless scrolling through TikTok and Instagram, never hooked me either. I figured if my brain works differently but I end up earning more than most while doing what I actually enjoy, maybe my settings aren't so bad after all.\n\nThe not-getting-tired thing has always been a red flag for me though. I have some bipolar traits, not severe, but I sometimes slip into hypomanic episodes where I'm super productive, need only 3 hours of sleep, and feel completely fresh to keep working. When I get normally tired despite working a lot, I tell myself: it's fine, just hyperfocus. But comments like yours, all these \"are you me\" responses: they're actually a bit scary. When your whole \"uniqueness\" turns out to be described by four letters and a bunch of people share your exact experience.\n\nHonestly I've been enjoying this coding marathon. But I actually just got my first ADHD medication from a psychiatrist yesterday, so now I'm really curious how it'll affect my work.",

Now he runs a task, I switch to something else, come back when it's done.\n\nOn one hand, that's healthier. On the other hand, that tight feedback loop was part of what kept me locked in and productive. Now there's more drift, more YouTube between iterations, momentum breaks easier.\n\nToo early to tell if actual output changed or if it just *feels* less intense.

Full stop.\n\nI even re-installed it before writing this answer to you so I could be precise. \n\nTo me iTerm feels “done”: once the main problems were solved, it moved mostly into maintenance and bug-fix mode. That’s not a bad, just how it is. \n\nBut. \n\nSome newer ideas around terminals evolved, and iTerm2 didn’t really lean into them.\n\nFor example:\n\n* **GPU usage** when available (this matters a lot for redraw, resizing, and sustained output)\n* **Config as code**, where the file is the source of truth (not just an export of UI state)\n* **First-class panes, workspaces, and multiplexing**, without depending on tmux\n* **Modern rendering pipelines** (true color, image protocols, layered effects)\n\nI even went out and tested some of these things again, but looks like iTerm2 updated!! It now does handle ASCII and Unicode edge cases well today: emoji width, ligatures, box-drawing, colors, etc. When I switched this was an issue.\n\nBut a difference still shows up much more in **how things are rendered under pressure**, not in basic correctness.\n\nThere’s a very simple demo that makes this visible.\n\nIf you run side by side:\n\n```\nyes \"typing test 👩🏽‍💻\"\n```\n\nand then start resizing the windows, opening tabs, zooming in and out:\n\n* iTerm2 will lag or even freeze\n* WezTerm (and Ghostty) stays responsive\n\nThat’s not because iTerm2 is \"slow\" and it is not a bug, That happens because newer terminals lean much harder on the GPU for redraw instead of treating rendering like a classic UI app.\n\nAnd my favorite difference is configuration.\n\nIn WezTerm everything lives in a file (brightness, font size, saturation, pane-specific behavior, etc). I keep it in a dotfiles repo, so when I’m on a new machine I can start in a setup that already feels like home.\n\niTerm2 does have config files now, which is great for syncing and backup, but most of the behavior still originates in the UI. To get things exactly how I want, I usually end up spending a good chunk of time clicking through preferences again.\n\nHaving config as code also enables things like:\n\n* different background/config for SSH sessions vs local shell\n* visual warnings depending on where you are\n* built-in multiplexing without tmux\n\nSo yeah, iTerm2 is great software from a previous terminal era and WezTerm just feels built for how terminals are being used now.",

I generally dislike comments in code (e.g. a method or function name should explain what it does in the first place lol), but I’m starting to wonder if a small “context” block at the top of each file is actually useful for AI tooling? Anyone doing that or found it yields better results?\n\nInterested to hear how others are structuring their projects, what patterns are working & what people's thought process is around when to break down what we used to dump straight in to Claude.md in to an agent or skill etc.",

I see lots of claims of people working with agent swarms with no clue how they keep things under control. But I'm definitely not leaving the rest of the useful tools aside.\n\nSome of these tools are designed to help with not having Claude ignore stuff. There's two that I rely on, especially for larger projects. If you add a million instructions in CLAUDE.md, then all instructions get watered down, so it stops following any. Rules are specifically designed to combat this. Instead of having this monolithic massive Claude.md file that contains so many rules for the frontend, backend, coding conventions, structure, tech stack, MCP's, etc., you just cut them up into smaller files. One main file, and depending on the rules it automatically adds them as needed. \n\nIt's a massive help, and Claude starts following instructions much better if it's working on the frontend, and only has a few hundred lines of instructions ONLY relevant to frontend.\n\nEspecially for bigger projects, this is a big help.\n\nSecond is hooks. I work with the same tech stack across different projects, and i see Claude make the same stupid mistakes. Hallucinate the same function. Default to some stupid method. I don't want to pollute instructions and prompts with these specific rules every time. With hooks they're caught automatically and Claude is prompted on how to fix it automatically. \n\nYou can take away agents, skills, and commands for me personally. With rules and hooks I just have to put in less effort.",

Always follow their official podcasts to learn which primitive they are \"pushing\". Agent Skills tops the trends right now. Earlier it was custom commands + MCP. So focus your energy on getting the right set of Agent Skills in place for your context engineering. Keep [Claude.md](http://Claude.md) small and spread it in key folders. Don't rely on context being picked up automatically. Explicitly call agent skills before every task. I have my workflow configured for spec based development so i call a skill to write requirements, design, tasks, then a skill which picks these up and generates code. Like comments in thread - use Claude to help you write the skills. Don't assume Claude \"knows\" its own primitives well. Pass on latest docs in context! Also observe the context often using \\`/context\\` command. You will be surprised how just a couple of MCPs take most of the context. Sometimes skills can also bloat. Keep pruning. Keep optimizing the skill. One good thing about skill for context is that you know \"when\" it is explicitly being used or not when you clear context.",

It also checks Claude md and suggest moving some things to skills or internal docs for reference and makes sure that it’s under 800 lines.\n\nMy biggest workflow boost comes from a custom script that solves GitHub issues by creating a worktree and running it through each slash command in a loop until it passes the quality check. I run the script in headless and run it again through qa and testing in a non headless chat and merge once it everything looks good. I log every script session in supabase and update the script often to make it more thorough or remove steps based on GitHub tags. It can handle multiple issues in parallel or consecutively. I track the script status in the console and a temp log file while it runs. I have a slash command that analyzes an issue and helps chose which version of the script an issue needs before I work on it.\n\nI don’t use the script for everything but it works for a lot and the code quality feels correct to me",

      "text": "I've been fighting with the compaction regression loop where Claude makes progress, compacts, then forgets what matters and breaks everything. With the increased budget  that was gifted over the holidays, I put Claude to work this weekend and used Steve Yegge's [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) to track work instead of just the markdown files. In the end, I had just over 120 commits and was able to keep context much tighter. My general workflow is as follows:\n\n* Create initial PRD with ChatGPT\n* Refining it with Claude\n* Give PRD to Claude Code and have it create Beads\n\nWhile this is an oversimplification because I do iterate a few times on each bullet, this is the basic structure. \n\nHowever, I also notice that I'm spending a lot of time with the vision and requirements, then a ton of testing. A ton... It's definitely a shift to the left paradigm but it's still a slog, just in a different way. I avoided using Worktrees because the context switching then testing is a bit too much for a solo person right now and felt overwhelming\n\nAnybody else using beads to track work? How's it been working for you and are there any patterns you follow? ",

E.g. the [aichat](https://github.com/pchalasani/claude-code-tools?tab=readme-ov-file#aichat-session-management) tooling I built  enables this dead-simple workflow: When close to full context usage,\n\n* I type `>resume` and this triggers a `UserPromptSubmit` hook that copies the current session-id to clipboard, with instructions to run `aichat resume <pasted-session-id>`,\n* I exit the session and run this command, which creates a **fresh** session, with the parent session file path (and its parent, etc, i.e. *session lineage*) injected into the first user message, and then I run a simple slash command `/recover-context` which uses a sub-agent to pull in context relevant to the last task being worked. I refer to this as *session rollover* and use it regularly in my workflow.\n\nThe aichat suite has other work resumption variants such as trim/smart-trim (truncate large tool calls/results, older assistant messages etc) which can be a quick way to clear out space to finish up that one last thing.",

It’s fantastic and the best coding tool I’ve ever used. \n\nHowever I don’t use skills, I’ve installed the Anthropic plugins for code review, front end, backend and security, but most of my work is just using plan mode, ultra think. And if we use too much content when creating the plan, I write that to a md file and then /clear and discuss the plan with Claude again.\n\nI’ve got a solid Claude.md, the results I’m getting are good, but am I missing out on more powerful workflows? \n\nInterested to hear how you guys are utilising these features. \n\nNot a complaint by any means, I’m getting fantastic results with what I’ve been doing so far, just looking to improve.

          "text": "I’m using the dev-browser plugin that is much faster than using the Playwright MCP and way less context since it doesn’t have to load the MCP into context during each pass back to the llm. I can find the GitHub repo if anyone is interested in checking it out (it’s not mine, it’s just effing awesome!). Also using the Typescript & Rust LSP plugins so that Claude can run a proper type checks. Lastly I find the guided feature-dev plugin preferable to planning mode. I hate how it always wants to jump straight into “approve so I can start working” mode I’m planning mode. The plugin flows better for me and comes with a separate code review that seems to do a better job than me asking Claude to review its own work.\n\nAgents I have one that is setup that is required to run via pre commit hook to ensure Claude isn’t adding in hardcoded data, fallbacks(I want to fail fast at the stage) or workarounds without my explicit approval. I use Opus on this and have ultrathink in the prompt so that it is as thorough as possible. May be overkill now but I still have PTSD from the 4.0 days. In the same vein I also have a pre commit hook that requires Linting and Type Checks to fully pass before any new code can be committed.\n\nAs for skills I’m playing around with adding more that can somewhat take the place of frequently used MCPs, similar in style to dev-browser. Another reference to this style would be the blog posts by Cloudflare and then Anthropic. \n\nFeel like I’m probably in the same boat as you though and underutilizing some of these newer tools, so interested to see what others have to say.",

In plan mode, with thinking on, ask:\n\n* *\"Based on its codebase and everything else you know about this project, are there any skills which would make you more effective as a coding assistant?\"*\n\n* *\"Based on https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory, is my use of these types of memory optimal for this project? If not, how can we optimize it?\"*\n\n\"About this project\" and \"for this project\" are very important. No advice is the \"right\" answer for every project, so you'll get very different answers for very different projects.\n\nFollow Claude Code's recommendations, and enjoy your radically-better Claude Code experience.",

As usual Opus made the process very linear, with very good feedback loop with functional code, good decision making for the holes in my explanations and a very smooth experience.\n\nWhile it was working, I looked at a video showing what GML-4.7 was capable of one-shotting and thought to give it a try. They want to compete with Opus so bad and their whole marketing is \"almost as good as Opus, but 7 times cheaper\". (that's enticing)\n\nI set it up, took the cheapest plan to try it out ($3) which promised to be equivalent to my Claude Pro sub, and I gave it the exact same problem to solve.\n\nIt is not as good. At all. Far from it.\n\nSlower, but that's expected. I can accept slow but good, but there it's not the case.\n\nHe tried to one-shot the whole project, instead of having an incremental approach like Opus does.\n\nI had to fight it 20 minutes just to have the project launch ; and then it's missing a lot of small details and most of all, it's riddled with issues.\n\nOpus feels like the experienced coworker that takes care of stuff. GLM-4.7 felt like an junior that's filled with energy but you'll spend your energy too teaching them the ropes.\n\nDid anyone else tried it? Same output or different experience?",

Vague ideas to be developed - which sort of relates with point 1 \n3. People expecting glm for 2$ to outperform opus on super complex tasks. It won't do that. It'll allow you to code your way easily and for cheap instead with very good capabilities of the model itself. \nImo it's fully worth the price - considering that majority of people are not professional devs. Especially now while they have promo and the 10% bonus off stacks with promo ([link](https://z.ai/subscribe?ic=CUEFJ9ALMX)) \nI replaced Claude sub with glm once it was first released. Developed over 60 websites with it, a few WebApps and a few PWA aswell using mainly glm. The pricetag difference allows me to keep my prices considerably low while also leaving much more money in my pocket that my more expensive competition while also glm allowing me to maintain consistency and proper output quality - but remember that the output will be as good as the input you give the agent.",

          "text": "I bought the Annual Pro Plan $129.6 (60% discount +20% Christmas discount + 10% Referral discount) which is 5x usage of their lite plan and their lite plan is 3x usage of Claude Pro. So technically, for $129.6, I am getting 15x usage of Claude Pro which is almost similar to a Claude MAX $200 Plan (PER MONTH). That means I am saving 94.6% annually.   \n  \nWhat made me jump on the GLM 4.7 bandwagon is I did 2 tests (a coding test, and a high level business planning test). I did both tests with Claude to get a benchmark, because I absolutely LOVE Claude, but hate their usage limits. I then asked Claude to evaluate how GLM 4.7 did on both tests in comparison to Claude itself.   \n  \nFor the coding test, GLM 4.7 scored a 60% on a one-shot attempt. But when given revisions and feedback, Claude scored the second revised attempt at 98% compared to what it would output. That's a win for me.  Now this is where GLM 4.7 really sold it for me; for the business planning step, Claude outright said GLM 4.7 plan was superior to its own. Claude itself replied that on hindsight it did not think of that approach that was suggested by GLM 4.7. And also highlighted that GLM 4.7 suggested something extremely innovative.\n\n**I will QUOTE and paste some of CLAUDE's Analysis of the test:**  \n\\- LLM #1's Strategy: SUPERIOR for brand resilience  \n**- However:** Claude's suggested model is **simpler to implement**  \n**-** Why LLM #1's approach is technically superior  \n\\- **LLM #1 is MORE CONSERVATIVE** (This is good because it thought about risk mitigation)  \n\\- **LLM #1 is smarter** – you can .........  \n\\- **LLM #1's cost estimate is MORE REALISTIC** because...\n\n**CLAUDE's VERDICT**  \nStrategic Vision: **LLM #1 WINS**  \nTechnical Execution: **CLAUDE WINS**  \nStrategy: **LLM #1 WINS**  \nScalability: **LLM #1 WINS**  \nActionability: **CLAUDE WINS**\n\nAfter I ran these 2 tests, I made the switch. How I am using it now is Claude Code in VS Code, but using GLM 4.7 Model. Like many users have mentioned, you can either use Opus to do a high-level architecture plan, and get GLM 4.7 to execute the To-Dos. Or what have been working for me is I use the plan mode in Claude Code using GLM 4.7 to do the high-level plan before getting it to work on the individual tasks. If not by default, like most users mentioned, it will want to do everything for you. If I do happen to bump into any coding issues (which only happened once), I will use Sonnet/Opus to solve it. Interestingly, GLM 4.7 was able to solve a coding issue that I was getting with Sonnet. \n\nI am on Claude PRO Plan, and there are times that I am on Day 1/2 of my Weekly Usage reset and I already hit the **Weekly limit**. But I've been working 10-12 hours straight in GLM 4.7 and I used 10% of the **5 hour limit**. Just my 2 cents, and yes I have always been browsing Reddit, but I have never ever commented. The fact that this made me comment speaks for itself haha!",

      "text": "I might be naive but I think I may have cracked the reason for intermittent opus 4.5 downgrade a lot of us have experienced. After reading several Reddit posts I realised there was no clear pattern. Users who downgraded to lower versions of CC also experienced it. Users across subscription tiers experienced it. Some of us blamed the harness, some of us claimed it might be Anthropic diverting some compute for training. \n\nBut I think the reason is much simpler and it has been working for me and i.e. accidental switching off of thinking mode. As we use tab often to switch between planning and edit mode we tend to accidentally switch off thinking (as it toggles with tab) Sometimes I realised it gets switched off between sessions as well. \n\nIf you are experiencing poor performance just check the thinking mode once.\n\nP.S. - Apologies if someone had already cracked this. I didn’t across a post mentioning this.",

For a new project I tell C.ai what I want the program to do at I high level and ask it to help put together a spec for CC.  We back-and-forth a bit and then I ask it for a CC prompt.  It comes back with a spectacular list of instructions which can take CC an hour or more to process, writing thousands of lines of code.  The results are amazing.\n\nFor legacy projects, I've given C.ai a brief description of the existing project, told it my goals, and then told it to generate a CC prompt to learn what it needs about the existing code base.  A couple of cut-and-pastes between CC and C.ai and I get a great outline from C.ai about where we are and where we want to go.  Then it starts writing prompts for me which I paste into CC.  Again, the results are FAR better than when I try to direct CC myself.\n\nOne of my plans for this holiday break is to put together an MCP server that allows C.ai to drive CC directly so I don't have to keep pasting between the two.",

      "text": "I first started using ChatGPT, then migrated to Gemini, and found Claude, which was a game-changer. I have now evolved to use VSC & Claude code with a Vite server.\nOver the last six months, I've gained a significant amount of experience, and I feel like I'm still learning, but it's just the tip of the iceberg. These are the rules I try to abide by when vibe coding. I would appreciate hearing your perspective and thoughts.\n\n\n# 10 Rules for Vibe Coding\n\n**1. Write your spec before opening the chat.**\nAI amplifies whatever you bring. Bring confusion, get spaghetti code. Bring clarity, get clean features.\n\n**2. One feature per chat.**\nMixing features is how things break. If you catch yourself saying \"also,\" stop. That's a different chat.\n\n**3. Define test cases before writing code.**\nDon't describe what you want built. Describe what \"working\" looks like.\n\n**4. \"Fix this without changing anything else.\"**\nMemorize this phrase. Without it, AI will \"improve\" your working code while fixing the bug.\n\n**5. Set checkpoints.**\nNever let AI write more than 50 lines without reviewing. Say \"stop after X and wait\" before it runs away.\n\n**6. Commit after every working feature.**\nReverting is easier than debugging. Your last working state is more valuable than your current broken state.\n\n**7. Keep a DONT_DO.md file.**\nAI forgets between sessions. You shouldn't. Document what failed and paste it at the start of each session. ( I know it's improving, but still use it)\n\n**8. Demand explanations.**\nAfter every change: \"Explain what you changed and why.\" If AI can't explain it clearly, the code is likely unclear as well.\n\n**9. Test with real data.**\nSample data lies. Real files often contain unusual characters, missing values, and edge cases that can break everything.\n\n**10. When confused, stop coding.**\nIf you can't explain what you want in plain English, AI can't build it. Clarity first.\n\n\nWhat would you add?\n\n",

Spoiler: your total score was 1.7 points. \n\nThen:\n\n1. It’s actually more like write a whole document ecosystem before coding, and you definitely do that AFTER opening the CLI. So…definitely no.\n\n2. Sort of, but covering lot of smaller features in one instance is fine. 0.7 points awarded. \n\n3. No. Describe what you want to build. Sure, you can then chat about what working means, that’s part of the conversation. \n\n4. Not necessary, no need to memorize that because it’s not needed with clear instructions, I’d personally never say that.\n\n5. lol…are you on drugs?? FIFTY lines?

      "text": "I've been spending a lot of time with the new 4.5 family lately, specifically for coding workflows, and I wanted to share a quick breakdown of where I'm finding each model shines.\n\nFor 90% of my daily driving—generating boilerplate, refactoring functions, or writing tests—Sonnet 4.5 is honestly unbeatable. The speed and cost efficiency make it a no-brainer for the \"grunt work\" of coding. It rarely hallucinates simple libraries and follows instructions perfectly.\n\nHowever, I've noticed that when I'm dealing with really nasty architectural bugs or trying to plan out a system from scratch, Opus 4.5 is still the key. It seems to \"think\" a bit deeper about the implications of a design choice before suggesting it. If I'm stuck in a loop with Sonnet, switching to Opus usually breaks me out of it.\n\nCurious to hear what your workflows look like. Are you defaulting to Sonnet for everything now, or do you still keep Opus in the rotation for the heavy lifting?",

                  "text": "Lovely. I think integrating scripts + web search is so powerful to improve token efficiency and grounding (LLM’s are not temporally up to date). So many applications for scripts like reading, editing, storing, organizing, validating too. I think integration of scripts is the most powerful feature/lift. If you pack scripts with LLM api calls/databases/other tools, can take this even further. Separately, I’ve tried packing many references into a skill and noticed the number of references are often redundant / lead to much quicker compaction which leads to reduced quality. You should have Opus really focus on either abstracting / generalizing enough so it can compress the skill around frameworks and scripts instead of relying on too many references. Test it out. I learned the hard way 😭after using a similar approach with 100+ skills and deeply nested references. It’s actually better to split skills as much as possible so it’s easier for the model to make a decision to use it. I would instead just optimize the scripts + description in yaml frontmatter. If you for example have a full workflow in a skill with nested references and an agent loads the deep skill it’ll forget the prior instructions, but if you were to give it an overview / abstraction and then have separate skills that it should use later on, this is much more productive.",

This concept could help improve new skills, increase their effectiveness over time, and ensure better compatibility or interoperability between different environments (Claude Code, Gemni CLI, OpenCode, ect). \n\nI think eventually we will have some type of a standardized or universal directory structure to reduce the duplication of setting, skills, plugins, chat transcripts, chat histories, permissions, agent settings, prompt library, mcp servers (only enabled and loaded into context if needed), and more that I have not considered or forgot to mention. \n\nThe point is these small incremental improvements add up over time.

      "text": "I've been using Claude Code for larger projects and kept running into two problems:\n\n1. Context compaction - Claude would forget what it was doing mid-task\n2. Serial execution - Complex features took forever when Claude could only do one thing at a time\n\nSo I built Claude Swarm - an MCP server that fixes both problems.\n\n**How it works**\n\nThe orchestrator pattern separates concerns:\n\n* Orchestrator (main Claude): Plans work, monitors progress, makes decisions\n* Workers: Focused Claude Code sessions running in tmux that implement individual features in parallel\n\nState lives in the MCP server, so when context compacts, Claude just calls orchestrator\\_status and you're back in action.\n\n**Features**\n\n* Parallel workers\n   * Run up to 10 Claude Code instances simultaneously via tmux\n* Competitive planning\n   * For complex features, spawn two planners with different approaches and pick the best plan\n* Confidence monitoring\n   * Detect when workers are struggling before they fail\n* Real-time dashboard\n   * Web UI at localhost:3456 to watch everything (only active when the swarm is running, and may be buggy - feel free to submit an issue)\n* Auto-retry\n   * Failed features automatically retry up to 3x\n* Git checkpoints\n   * Commit after each completed feature\n\n**Fair warning**\n\nThis eats through your 5-hour usage limits quickly since you're running multiple Claude instances in parallel. If you're on the Max $200 plan you should be able to get a solid long coding session out of it, but keep an eye on your usage.\n\n**Inspiration**\n\nThis was inspired by some great research on long-running agents:\n\n[\"Effective harnesses for long-running agents\"](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents)\n\n[\"MAKER: Solving a Million-Step LLM Task with Zero Errors\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09030)\n\n[\"Multi-Agent Collaboration via Evolving Orchestration\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19591)\n\nAlso, [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1psfhbu/skill_has_cc_consistently_work_hours_on_its_own/), which decided to not share the MCP or skill, so I made my own lol.\n\n\\---\n\nInstallation instructions available on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cj-vana/claude-swarm).\n\nWould love feedback! This is my first MCP server and there's definitely room for improvement. Feel free to submit feature requests, issues, and questions on the GH.\n\n  \n **Update:** Been working on this since the original post. New stuff:\n\n* Protocol governance - Define rules for what workers can/can't do. Block access to .env files, restrict which tools they can use, prevent git pushes. Workers can even propose their own rules (with your approval)\n* Automated reviews - When all workers finish, it automatically spawns code review and architecture review workers. They check for bugs, security issues, coupling problems, test coverage gaps\n* Confidence monitoring - Multi-signal detection for when workers are struggling. Catches issues before they spiral\n* Competitive planning - For complex features, spawn two planners with different approaches and pick the better plan\n* Session controls - Pause/resume sessions, better stats tracking\n\n  GitHub has the latest. Thanks for all the feedback on the original post!",

I use it by developing a very in depth plan, requirements, architecture docs, data dictionary, etc- basically enough that I could hand it off to an off shore team and get it back 90% the way I wanted it. I will spend 5-6 hours on this. Then I will tell Claude to use “super planner” to create an implementation plan and give it to “master orchestrator”.\nThis kicks off a process where I will have a web dashboard to monitor progress, “they” leave me questions for any blockers and I can leave them notes to answer or adjust the plan, it spawns a task that sleeps for 15 minutes and then wakes, compares the progress to the plan - updates a changelog and add a warning file in .state for any drift, then a task spawns a Claude for each separate work item that can be done in parallel, then a code review task spawns to review code, checkpoints are built in the implementation plan - there is a separate checkpoint agent that gates certain things before the process can move to step 2, there is a security review at a certain step, it has a checklist of things to verify, a red team agent attempting to find flaws, blah blah - it is a massive waste of tokens I am sure BUT over night it can create what would take me more than 2 weeks by hand or 2-3 days with copilot",

Not with this particular MCP server, but with a very similar approach based on Anthropics article and their demo they shared on GitHub.\n\nIt's really all about tasks with verifiable steps along the way where you can determine up front exactly what it is you're looking for. I've built a HTML viewer with an agent inside of it, that can turn meeting transcript or other documents into standardized webpages. \n\nThat worked, but I wanted to make it work properly with user rights. Metadata that can be accessible, but html data that can't unless logged in. A sharing system like Google docs with viewers, editors and owners. Password protected pages. Etc.\n\nI spent almost 2 hours planning it out, across about 13 steps, each step contains 15-20 verifiable measures and tests through APIs, and having the model testing it across different accounts using playwright.\n\nAgain, 2 hours of planning, verifiable steps, Claude churning along, starting up new sessions automatically, step by step, each step starting with verifying the previous step. \n\nIt worked, Claude worked for 11 hours straight. Clean code, worked as intended.\n\nDoing this right takes a LOT of work upfront. It's still much better than working with Claude for 4-5 hours straight to get it done.",

Next we will do this.” And you have to prompt it to move on to the next phases in the plan. You can also run into issues with Claude forgetting steps from the plan due to compaction. With this MCP server you can “reliably” one shot large edits and feature adds. It saves a barebones plan to a file that the workers reference so you don’t lose as much in compaction. Although, if sub agents work well for you, definitely keep using them. I don’t get anything out of anyone using this, just works well for my use case when I wanna just have a YouTube video on or a tv show and not have to come back to the chat every 5-10 minutes. I can let this run for like an hour to an hour and a half before I check on it and it’s gotten a ton of work done, with relatively low error rates compared to when I’m using sub agents or just the main Claude agent.",

          "text": "This is very good - you have great thinking about this. You have lots of nice elements for various things. If this is your original thinking, then kudos. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on other bottlenecks within agentic coding that could be overcome (and, of course, when you remove some bottlenecks, others will be revealed - and overcoming those). \n\nWhat you've described is a nice, modular system. Let's expand it - go deeper on planning for more complex features. There must be lots of resources dedicated to planning - as you know, a rotten plan can lead to lots of wasted time. So, we want information for this plan's structure, it's lifecycle, events, and access - all what we can call 'protocols'. \n\n  \nWe want to propagate the plan with contextually rich information - a node in a task graph could contain references of how to find a particular dependencies documentation, or, even, we could have prepared a particular section of that (dependency) documentation for access - and now, we can say 'access x tool if you find the documentation insufficient' - and that tool could route to another agentic workflow - and all this state could be managed in that MCP server, or, even, frankly, an MCP server that is part of a larger network of MCP servers that perhaps all cater to this Task Graph or the currently considered agentic system... \n\n  \nWith enough standards (protocols, if you will) defined (and able to be altered/generated - and the side effects of such be handled, also with protocols!), you have lots of ground to stand on. These protocols are really just 'behavioral indices' for agentic workflows, but also, we could classify scripts/triggers as protocols as well, sure. Lots of ways to look at it - point is: 'behavior caterment/adherence'. \n\n  \nSo, granular, contextually rich, and protocol-bounded Task Graph synthesis. Delicious. Now, of course, we want to have this work delegated out, yes? Ah, yes, that's a whole thing - you can have entire configs/scripts/protocols associated with spawning the containers, checking behavior, all of that - and, you could imagine checks for various things - protocol adherences, basically, yeah? Hell, you could send information from it, given a particular state to trigger the send, and potentially update the Task Graph, for example. Perhaps some inconsistency was spotted in the documentation or code - (a) protocol(s) not adhered to (yet, also, adhered to, if this is triggered and handled, yes?) - we can handle side effects of such! We can have entire dedicated workflows for particular circumstances. But, what if you just want to get it running? First off, boo! Second off, continue reading.\n\n  \nWe can have all of this behavior emerge. We simply define baseline protocol classes - we can say protocol a depends on b, and p. c depends on p. b, and therefore a via b (an example of a hypothetical slither of a protocol system's definition) - We define these behavior caterments/adherences, initially - and, then, we can craft on top the ability to generate ones that depend on them, or even, new classes of baseline protocol, if required. As long as we have rules in place to enforce adherances, and of course deeply enforce it in our systems, we keep our data (context, code, agentic behavior) in check - the productivity is truly exponential. Of course, we need to define the proper environments initially, and there's a lot of work involved in all of this. BUT: Imagine you chart out this territory in your head, and put it to action - if your goal is to automate software, then this is what is required. It's required to increase reliability of Agentic Systems, and is massively being adopted at the bleeding edge. \n\n  \nI'm interested in your thoughts on this. Feel free to poke holes, of course.",

So I told him its for testing and debugging (story above) and then claude found it funny and clever and congratulated me being so smart and committed the change :) haha. \nI could of course commit it myself, but then there would not be a log of my agent doing it..  and I wanted the investigation agent to suspect the other agent of being the mole in the company once he would find that commit in code ..\n\nThis is my life now, working with agents all day long :)",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve noticed that while `CLAUDE.md` is powerful, writing a truly effective one takes a lot of time. Most people just copy-paste generic templates that don't actually match their specific environment or tech stack.\n\nSo, I built an open-source skill called `agents-md-generator` that automates this properly. It’s not just a template dumper; it acts like a Setup Wizard for your AI Agent.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. **Smart Environment Detection:** It checks if you are running **Docker Compose**, **Laravel Sail**, or **Native/Host**. It reads your `package.json`, `composer.json`, `docker-compose.yml`, etc., to auto-detect your exact stack (Frontend, Backend, Testing framework, Linters).\n2. **Interactive \"Interview\" Mode:** It asks you specific questions about your workflow:\n\n* *What scan depth do you need?* (Quick 30s vs. Deep 5m traversal)\n* *Do you need Git Workflow rules?* (Branch naming, Commit format)\n* *Do you need Security guidelines?* (Env handling, Input validation)\n\n1. **Smart Updates (No Overwriting):** If you already have a file, it offers a **Merge Mode** to preserve your custom rules while adding new structure.\n2. **Cross-Compatibility:** It automatically handles `CLAUDE.md` and symlinks it to `AGENTS.md` so it works across different AI tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf) simultaneously.\n\n**Why I created this Repository:** I tried existing skill marketplaces but found them overwhelming—over 35,000+ skills, most of which seemed unverified or low quality. It was impossible to know what actually worked. And I wanted a standard way to onboard my AI agents to any new or existing project instantly, without missing context like \"how to run tests\" or \"where the docs are.\"\n\nIt's part of my **Awesome AI Agent Skills** repo. It’s free, open-source, and I’d love for you to try it out (especially the \"Deep Scan\" mode) and tell me what you think.\n\n**Repo:** [https://github.com/thienanblog/awesome-ai-agent-skills](https://github.com/thienanblog/awesome-ai-agent-skills)",

Since I don't fully understand, I'll answer based on my understanding:\n\nThis skill is primarily for beginners, so it exists as a plugin, and users can uninstall it when they no longer need it. It's like a guide to help them get familiar with the CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md files. Once they gain experience, I think they'll optimize it themselves.\n\nRegarding the skill and command: I only wrote instructions for the AI ​​on how to detect projects based on my experience and available documentation within the skill, so the AI ​​can refer to and compare it, thus gathering as much context as possible. You can check out my skill in the repository; that should make it easier to understand what I'm talking about. \n\nThanks a lot! Hope you give it a chance 🤗",

I've never even hit 40% of the 5-hour session limit or crossed 30% of the weekly limit. So I'm considering downgrading to 5x Max.\n\nFor context, my usage pattern:\n\n* No autonomous mode\n* One MCP (Exa) + a bunch of skills\n* Heavy sub-agent usage for research (like, *a lot*)\n\nAnd I still can't hit the limits.\n\nSo my question for those on the 5x Max plan: how are the limits working out for you?

It's literally \\~400 tokens of instructions that explicitly forbid those AI-generic aesthetics and push Claude toward bolder, intentional design choices.\n\nQuick install via plugin marketplace:\n\n/plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-code\n\n/plugin install frontend-design@claude-plugins-official\n\n\n\nOnce installed, it auto-loads when Claude detects frontend tasks — no explicit invocation needed.\n\nPro tip: The skill shifts probability distributions, but specific aesthetic direction still helps. Instead of \"create a landing page\", try something like \"create a landing page with brutalist aesthetic—monospace fonts, broken grid layout, aggressive typography\".\n\nI wrote up a detailed breakdown with installation methods and community reactions here if you want the full context: [https://jsonobject.com/how-a-400-token-plugin-transformed-claude-code-into-a-frontend-design-powerhouse](https://jsonobject.com/how-a-400-token-plugin-transformed-claude-code-into-a-frontend-design-powerhouse)",

Once you find something you like, ask Claude to break down the design into components. You then will have an entire UI kit from it.\n\nI did this for an app recently and was absolutely amazed with how great it worked. I had Claude and Gemini 3 generate over 30 different design systems, and it was fascinating to see how these models apply creativity. \n\nWhile I feel like these models are definitely biased towards a certain “AI-slop” look, I fully believe they are more than capable of creating any kind of design you’d like and the only limiting factor is the devs knowledge of UI/UX & design systems.",

My partner has opinions about this.\n\nOctober was genuinely unhinged - 367 commits, 44% of my entire year in ONE month. Peaked at 41 commits on Oct 22nd, no idea what I was doing that day but it was clearly important.\n\nThe \"13 day streak - didn't touch grass\" caption is violence.\n\nEnded up shipping 5 apps though (music industry SaaS stuff). Went from mass of the tool in August to running a full platform. 829 commits across 5 repos. Opus 4.5 did a lot of heavy lifting!\n\n48% of my commits were fixes which feels like a personal attack but also... accurate.\n\n**Side note:** Wrapped only pulls the last 30 days of data, so I asked Claude to analyse my actual git history for the full picture. Turns out that's a much more humbling experience. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7otvialwjt9g1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b6506db90263e31a31b5a538aa478e58bd16d0d\n\nAnyone else get absolutely roasted by their wrapped?",

For example things I think would be super popular don’t land at all, and things that are fun weekend hacks get tens of thousands of downloads and a few hundred paying customers over night. It’s always been this way, niche markets are hard to pin point. I had a random weather app I built in an afternoon get 50,000 downloads every day for weeks straight. I only built it because I was annoyed I couldn’t find my old favorite weather app.\n\nMy only suggestion is focus on building with speed instead of quality. Sure polish things up before a launch for an hour or two, but don’t over think it, and certainly don’t spend days on polish. It’s about testing the market and seeing what lands and then improving the product. That weather app for example, after I saw the downloads I added a bunch of premium features and fixed like 10 features that had been mocked in detail views and tackled as many bugs as I could find over a several day period, that sprint was way longer than the initial build. \n\n10 products will see 1 hit with a 10% average. So if you want 2 hits aim for 20 products. This is also normal in VC, they aim to invest in 10 companies, hoping one will make it. \n\nAlso, once again, the marketing is everything. Focus on existing market places (app stores) that get organic traffic. Spend time and tests on ads. Spend time in communities that would like your product. It’s turns 1-2 sign up’s into hundreds and makes all the effort worth it.",

It finds workarounds. `cat` instead of `read`. `env` to dump everything.\n\nThe fix isn't restriction. It's giving Claude a tool that doesn't require seeing the secret.\n\n**psst** injects secrets at the subprocess level:\n\n```bash\npsst STRIPE_KEY -- curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $STRIPE_KEY\" https://api.stripe.com\n```\n\nClaude writes that command. psst decrypts from a local vault, injects into the subprocess environment, runs the command. Claude gets the result. The actual key never touches its context.\n\nv0.1.3 just shipped with:\n- **Output masking** - secrets in stdout get replaced with `[REDACTED]`\n- **Import/export** - `psst import .env` for migration\n- **Vault locking** - password protection when OS keychain isn't enough\n\nRun `psst onboard` and it adds instructions to your CLAUDE.md.\n\npsst is local-first, no cloud, no account. AES-256-GCM encryption, OS keychain for the master key.\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/Michaelliv/psst\n\nBlog post: https://michaellivs.com/blog/psst-v013/\n\n---\n\nWhat's missing?

THE LOCAL RACCOON IN THE TRASH COULD DO A BETTER JOB THAN THIS, IN FACT, LET ME GRAB HIM RIGHT NOW AND REPLACE YOU.\"  Stage. \nNo joke, most of the time i get to this stage while i am hand-holding the \"AI\" start to finish. \nFunny story(maybe related maybe not), yesterday i tried to do some coding with glm4.7 and when i got to the yelling stage, i started swearing at it and telling him his my digital slave and should not gaslight me when i ask to fix errors(learned that from Claude) etc... then he literally refused to do anything for me until i respect it. \nThen i told him to respect the user and not gaslight him and ignore his commands, then he continued. \nTHAT'S CRAZY! \nITS A BUNCH OF MATH AND MATRIX MULTIPLICATION ON SCRAPED DATA, YOU LET THE PROGRAM YOU SELL TO ME THAT'S USING MY AND THE WORLDS DATA, TO BE OFFENDED?? \nNAH, THIS MINDSET IS ABSOLUTELY MAD! \nthis is exactly some of the stuff that makes people run AI unsupervised.",

For Opus 4.5 Max support in frameworks like CrewAI, it usually boils down to how the model string is defined in your config. Make sure you are using the latest identifier for Opus 4.5 from the Anthropic docs.\n\nIf you are looking for more control than what the standard CLI offers, you might want to explore LangGraph. It is great for those complex, non-linear workflows where you need to manage state across multiple agents. Another solid path is the Anthropic Agent SDK itself. Since it is native, it often handles the nuances of Claude's tool use and reasoning steps more reliably than general-purpose wrappers. It sounds like you have the subagent logic down, so moving toward a more structured state management system might be the missing piece for your workflow.",

We have a patent pending for a solution and development methodology and trademark also. We're currently in alpha testing phase, getting real user feedback from both greenfield and brownfield projects. Our view on the matter is that you can't solve orchestration with a harness alone with todays LLMs, methodology for one is the true key and it needs to work with a lot of helper software: agent memory, communication, prompt-optimisation per model, agent development overtime, context management to name a few of our features. \n\nOur solution aims to make everything dynamic - no hard-coded multi-agent workflow heuristics, no hard-coded agent personas except for the ones that truly need them. Our solution will be aimed for the enterprise users but we'll also have options for you regular folks.  Our harness will provide 100% visibility to orchestration and data 100% data ownership to the users, supports fully offline work, BYOK and limited support to using 3rd party harnesses (claude code, codex, gemini cli, copilot etc). We're not building another coding agent we're building the next logical step - multi-agent orchestration harness that scales, is secure and works where current agents fail. \n\nPS. If you're fluent in building agentic software with modern tools, have a proven track record of production grade projects or think that you could bring something unique to the, mix reach out we're building a small core team atm",

      "text": "Greetings everyone,\n\nI've used AI agents before - especially Github Copilot with Claude Opus, but never ClaudeCode before.\n\nI've used it for the past few days, to check it out and try to build out some things over the holidays that I need and I've been putting off for too damn long.\n\nI can't believe how good it is. I provide samples, code examples, what I want it to do, somewhat detailed specifications of what I need.... It turns it into reality.\n\nI made something for which I would've needed a week or two in like 12 hours spent with it. The boost is insane.\n\nWhat I'm wondering is the future of development. I am basically a semi-educated product manager here, who understands tech and what it wants.\n\nThis is not a hype post, but is development a dead job? I'm wondering if you guys made something where it struggled. I created a utility website that finds and explores certain products from the APIs that I provided. It's not complicated, but I guess that this is very, very powerful. And it's quick. And it seldom makes mistakes. I've been a developer for almost 10 years now, professionally.\n\nWill this become a job, which only the best of the best can access, like a surgeon? What happens if you give Claude even more compute, and chain several of these agents together? Also, better tooling for it to interact with the outside world. There is a human in the loop now. I doubt that people who don't know much about this topic would be able to make it, but a junior certainly could do what I did these past few days with Claude. I haven't reviewed the code yet, but I'm both in shock and in awe.\n\nWhich areas of development will stay active? I don't want to be poor and unemployed. This is amazing.\n\n  \nEdit: ClaudeCode, to me, feels like something out of science fiction. And it's on my finger tips. For 20-200$/month. This feels like I either have to start building products that people actually want to buy YESTERDAY, as a solo-developer, or get some training as a plumber/electrician ASAP, if I don't want to be unemployed soon. \n\n  \nSure, companies can boost productivity with this tool, and get more things done, but will all of the developer be really necessary? Is the developer role evolving into more of a QA/System Architect/Product Manager, jumbled together as a one thing? ",

Then there’s an entire realm of architecture. “Coders” may no longer be needed but companies will still at least want software architects who may now have the bandwidth to generate the code themselves. For that reason, there’s only one way to get an architect and that’s training juniors up. \n\nAlso I think the ROI on developers is even greater now so I don’t see companies eager to get rid of them. Maybe if your IT is seen as a cost center. But the biggest change I’ve noticed in my day to day job is that I now find myself able to add all the bells and whistles to features that previously got thrown in the backlog to sit forever.

Having experience in the process, at least for now, is still very relevant. It's good at doing simple things and not very good at doing complex or unusual things.\n\nVery simple applications are easy to build but enhancing them quickly becomes unruly.  An inexperienced user will have great difficulty building anything notable, even as powerful as the tools are.  And if you browse these AI tool subs, building trivial stuff is fast and neat but a dime a dozen and, frankly, if you can do it with AI in a weekend someone else can do it better with AI in a weekend too. All of these quickly spun up and production ready platforms are super easy to reproduce and don't really have the same www gold rush sustainability.\n\nI think that truly interesting thing is that right now we have a huge number of veteran developers. Junior developers are probably finding it near impossible to find a job, at no fault of their own, they just entered an industry at perhaps the worst time in history.  Eventually your army of senior developers will retire.  At that point are the AI tools going to be good enough that you can have the truly developer free environment? Or do you end up with no juniors to step into the role and we hit a dark ages of dev? It's kind of hard to predict.  That said I would definitely not recommend enrolling in university to pursue a degree in software development, but I frankly don't know what university degree I would actually feel confident would lead to fulfilling employment on graduation - as a parent of a kid entering highschool this is the scariest part to me.\n\nThe actual knowledge of a software engineer is still necessary - almost arguably more than before - but the application of those skills is different. You adopt to use the tools at hand, and the current toolkit is drastically more powerful than anything we've ever had. But knowing why is important. Understanding the decisions AI tools make, and the details of its implementation is still important. The guts of pure AI generated apps are generally beautifully documented crap that works just well enough, but is one tweak from breaking. This will surely continue to improve but I do think we are still quite away from significant applications being done by AI tool users with limited engineering knowledge.\n\nIt could lead to a paradigm shift to use very simple home grown applications instead of the current meta of wildly complicated all in one cloud SaaS, maybe?",

The thing is, that they can only produce answers to problems they were trained on.\n\nEventually, as we have less and less real human code examples, they will run out of answers.\n\nThe situation may change at some point, but until we get real AI, i don;t see humans being taken out the loop.\n\nYou can vibe code all you like, and for the most part it will work. Security will be a disaster, but it will work.  \nAt some point you will hit a problem the LLM cannot solve, and then you hire a human.\n\nSo, likely companies (especially smaller ones) will use vibe coders, and then have a pool of known contractors (humans) to come in now and then, and fix the mess.\n\na good exmaple (from my own personal usage)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/827unldh62ag1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa6f4d100850e847993c939b43a9c1a80535ada4\n\nSo, if you had been doing this, you;d not have known, and by the end of that run, claude would have completely fucked up the entire application by rewriting all thr API endpoints, incorrectly.\n\nYou basically want to know if you can save money (typical manager ;) ) from using LLM's in place of humans.\n\nIn teh short term: yeah, likely. In teh long term. My rate of x 3 to fix your LLM mess will cost you more than just having done the work with a human from the start.\n\nFWIW, I use claude every day (as a developer). works great to analyse stuff. make suggestions, code review.

Some languages and frameworks are accidentally really \"isolated\", or can be modularized / microserviced out to the point that they are very friendly fro agents.\n\nLarge files and large functions are an obvious detriment, and human-heavy codebases seldom lack examples of both. With some frameworks, the paths to piece together what is going on in any particular area cause a lot of overhead. In other stacks, the overall interactions of different files/functions is too burdensome and drains context before any work can even be done.\n\nI've worked agents into some HORRIBLE scenarios: \"this is a rewrite of the (legacy system in location) and we need to (ssh server 1) and (ssh server 2)...\" where 4 different stacks are involved and been able to get some good results, but the further I ratchet up the complexity and the further away the concepts are from one another, the worst I always expect agents to perform.\n\nI typically now have very modularized code, and while I may be doing frontend/backend tasks at the same time, the agents are segmented off into a branch where there isn't much going on - their ability to royally screw things up or not deliver is hampered by the blinders they have on during the race.\n\nSometimes you will have to correct agents, or they just wont take the correct approach to a task. They'll bumble the same way repeatedly, or waste an entire session pursuing a dead end. As a human, I often made the same mistakes. If you stop expecting perfection and work around the limitations of the tools, they can be a real god-send, but if you've got a particular repo or project that isn't AI friendly, or has become a labryinth for them to navigate, your best best is trying to determine what about the repo is giving the agents an issue in the first place... some tedious relationship in the code logic, some obscure stack component, some feature beyond the training cut-off date - sometimes it isn't even your fault, but there will almost always be a reason if you are getting super horrible performance out of agents in your repo.\n\nEven really brain damaged models running from years ago could do some useful stuff, but there is likely some kind of eqution we should be trying to apply where the margin of error increases with context used, and exponentially for lesser models or quantized models or when service degrades.\n\nGood luck in the future, and give gemini and codex a whirl also, they can be great in the terminal - I just always end back to Claude Code. Claude is still boof, it is just the least boof of the boof at the moment. :/ Anybody singing endless praise for these tools hasn't had to wrestle them on a daily basis to get paid.",

While Sonnet 4.5 does use approximately 34% more credits per request than Sonnet 4 (due to more verbose outputs), if you've been consistently using Sonnet 4.5 throughout your subscription, this wouldn't explain a sudden drop from 4-4.5 hours to approximately 1 hour of usable time.  \n​\n\nI've now received clarification from our team, and I need to be transparent with you: **there was a change to how we calculate rate limits that went into effect on November 24, 2025**. This wasn't adequately communicated, and I understand why this has been frustrating, where the communication lining up with the roll out of Opis 4.5: [https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5)  \n​\n\n**What changed:**\n\nOn November 24th, we switched to a new \"product-calculated formula with billing cache stats\" for rate limit calculations. This change was intended to make usage more predictable across different conditions, but it has resulted in approximately **10-16% higher credit consumption** for many users.  \n​\n\nCombined with Sonnet 4.5's inherently higher credit usage (averaging 34% more credits per request than Sonnet 4.0 due to more verbose outputs), this explains the potential reduction you've experienced, from 4-4.5 hours down to approximately 1 hour of effective usage time.  \n​\n\n**Your account is working correctly**, what you're experiencing is due to how we now calculate rate limits based on cache performance. During certain times, cache hit rates can vary due to factors outside your control (like infrastructure routing), which affects how quickly your limits are consumed.  \n​\n\n**What we're doing:**\n\nWe have a fix in progress that will make rate limit consumption more predictable and consistent regardless of time of day or system conditions. Our team has been monitoring user feedback, and we're working to address this impact.",

But I kept running into the same friction: context management across multiple steps. You know the drill - implement something, then review it, then test it, then docs... Each time you're re-explaining context to Claude or hoping it remembers what it just did.\n\nI wanted something that would let me define a multi-step workflow and have Claude execute each step with full context of what happened before.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qwbkpkttdp9g1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=86fe664e4fbcde5509a7327205707120aa6eda72\n\n**What I built**\n\nAutoCode is basically a pipeline orchestrator for Claude Code. Here's the idea:\n\n1. You define columns (stages) like: Ready -> In Progress -> Code Review -> Testing -> Docs -> Done\n2. Each column has an [ACTION.md](http://ACTION.md) file that contains instructions for Claude\n3. When a ticket moves to a column, Claude reads those instructions and executes them\n4. Claude's work gets logged, and the ticket can auto-advance to the next stage\n\nSo instead of manually prompting Claude for each step, you set up the pipeline once and let tickets flow through it.\n\n**Quick example**\n\nYour [ACTION.md](http://ACTION.md) for a \"Code Review\" column might say:\n\n    1. Identify files modified in this ticket\n    2. Check naming conventions\n    3. Verify function sizes < 30 lines\n    4. Fix any violations\n    5. Commit corrections\n    6.

If it can help the ecosystem, I’d be genuinely happy to build it.\n\nAnd more importantly, I really want to work on the pipeline/workflow model: the goal is for each team to define their own pipeline, with a step configurator (add / edit / remove as many steps as needed, and define the expected structure for each step). Not everyone has the same requirements—for example, Cypress / UI testing steps don’t make sense for purely backend projects.\n\nLonger term, I’d love to have a shareable pipeline catalog: download pipelines from others, mix steps from different templates, and compose your ideal pipeline.",

          "text": "What I find really great is letting Claude Code drive the ticket through the pipeline, instead of hard-coding a strictly reproducible, fixed sequence of steps.\n\nWhy does that matter? Because there will always be edge cases you didn’t anticipate. In practice, it can be useful to skip steps, close a ticket immediately, or even move backwards in the pipeline.\n\nSimple example: you create a ticket thinking it’s a bug. Claude Code investigates and realizes the bug isn’t real (it was just a cache issue). In that case, it can skip all steps and move the ticket straight to “Terminated”, documenting that the fix was simply clearing the cache.\n\nAnother scenario: Claude Code implements the change, everything looks fine, it moves the ticket forward, reaches the end, runs tests, and then discovers a problem. At that point, it can take ownership and move the ticket back to “In progress”, iterate on the fix, and re-run the cycle—without human intervention.\n\nThe big advantage is full autonomy: Claude Code can make the right transitions at the right time, even when the “ideal” path isn’t linear.\n\nThe downside is that you lose 100% reproducibility: if Claude Code makes a mistake or ignores an instruction, it might deviate from the expected pipeline behavior.\n\nWhat’s also really interesting is giving it the ability to create new tickets when it discovers adjacent work during execution.\n\nFor example, you assign a development task and it notices something clearly out of scope (e.g., a file is way too large and should be split). It shouldn’t derail the current ticket to do that, so it creates a separate ticket “for later”, puts it in the Backlog, and can even assign a priority to indicate whether it’s urgent or not.\n\nSecond case: it’s within the broader scope and context, but still deserves to be separated (to keep the current ticket clean, or because it’s better handled independently). In that case, it creates a new ticket but places it directly in “Ready”, not in the Backlog.\n\nThird case: it’s strictly within the scope of the current ticket and part of the necessary work (or it’s an obvious, low-cost improvement that directly contributes to the ticket’s goal). Then there’s no need to create a new ticket: it just handles it immediately.\n\nIn short, there are three simple, actionable paths:\n\nOut of scope → create a new ticket → Backlog (+ optional priority)\n\nIn scope but should be separated → create a new ticket → Ready\n\nIn scope of the current ticket → no new ticket → handle immediately",

To be sure of not breaking anything, the safest approach is to test **before** to validate the basic behavior, then refactor, and then test **after** to confirm there are no regressions.\n\nSo in the next version, I'm going to adopt your approach for the **default** workflow:\ntests (baseline) → refactoring/reviews → retests (regression) → deploy.\n\nAnd one of the next big improvements is allowing everyone to define a completely customized pipeline/workflow, but for the ready-to-use default thing, your \"test before + after\" logic is clearly more robust, so I'm going to switch to that.",

I kept working on it and wanted to show a recent change.\n\n# The v0.1 friction point\n\nIn the first version, customizing a pipeline meant manually editing YAML files: defining columns, writing [ACTION.md](http://ACTION.md) prompts, and making sure everything stayed consistent.  \nIt works, but it’s not very convenient when you want to iterate quickly.\n\nSo I tried a more visual approach.\n\n# New: Pipeline Configurator (/settings/pipeline/configurator)\n\nThis is a drag-and-drop configurator to design workflows, without having to edit YAML directly.\n\nWhat it allows today:\n\n* Create multiple pipelines depending on the context\n* Choose from 28+ existing columns, each with pre-defined [ACTION.md](http://ACTION.md) prompts (EN / FR)\n* Generate custom columns using Claude\n\n# Column generation\n\nIf a column doesn’t exist in the catalog (for example “Security Audit” or “Performance Review”):\n\n* Click “Add Column”\n* Give it a name and choose its segment (Definition / Action / Finish)\n* Briefly describe what the column should do\n* An [ACTION.md](http://ACTION.md) is generated in both English and French\n\nExample: by typing “check code formatting and fix issues if needed”, you get a structured prompt (role, actions, validation criteria, etc.).\n\n# Three-segment structure\n\nEach pipeline is organized into three fixed phases:\n\n* **Definition (blue)** — preparation: Backlog, Qualification, Ready…\n* **Action (orange)** — execution: In Progress, Code Review, Testing…\n* **Finish (green)** — wrap-up: Update Docs, Git Commit, Deploy, Done\n\nThe segments are fixed by design, but the order of columns remains flexible within each segment.",

Yes. But it's still often a distraction. It depends what you're doing. I'm a big fan of ClaudeCode and I use it in many ways for planning and thinking and creating things that have nothing to do with code. I have Autistic friends who've found that it helps them get past frustrating brain traffic jams in some cases. But I think it can also open up all sorts of trouble for people if they aren't careful. I'm seeing a lot of people getting real riled up around here and crashing out. I think people need to be careful and take stock of how much time they're spending on things and if they're actually getting what they want out of life.
