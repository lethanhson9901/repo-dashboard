Previously we had to be selective: Opus for planning/design review, cheaper models for execution. With Sonnet 4.6 closing that gap, more tasks can run on a single model tier without the quality cliff.\n\nThe 1M context is interesting but honestly the bigger unlock for multi-agent work is the improved instruction following. An agent that actually stays in scope for 200 turns without drifting is worth more than one that can see 1M tokens but wanders.",

We were routing to Opus for anything requiring judgment calls because Sonnet wasn't reliable enough. If 4.6 genuinely closes that gap, the cost math changes significantly. We spend a lot on orchestration overhead just deciding which tasks need Opus vs Sonnet. A flatter capability curve means simpler routing logic, fewer costly escalations, and more autonomous agent runs. Curious whether the \"approaching Opus-level\" holds up on multi-step reasoning chains, not just single-turn benchmarks — that's where Sonnet has historically fallen apart for us.",

Agent teams are used where sensible, and the task formatting integrates seamlessly with the native task management.\n\nThe core idea: code is a liability; judgement is an asset. Most setups I see go **prompt → plan → code**. Mine goes **idea → crystallized brief → grounded first-principles design → adversarial review → design iteration → atomic planning → parallel build → build  validation → QA pipeline → security review**. Every transition is a quality gate that blocks forward progress until validation passes, and context never contains more than whats in scope for the task.\n\nWhat it looks like in practice:\n\n**/arm** — You dump your fuzzy thoughts. Opus extracts requirements, constraints, non-goals, style, and key concepts through conversational Q&A, then forces remaining decisions in a single structured checkpoint. Output is a brief, not a design.\n\n**/design** — Opus takes the brief and does first-principles analysis. Every constraint gets evaluated and classified. Soft constraints treated as hard constraints get flagged. It reconstructs the optimal approach from only validated truths, researches via Context7 (live library docs) and web search, aligns with codebase patterns then iterates with you until alignment. Output is a formal design document.\n\n**/ar** —  Three models critique your design in parallel, each with different training data and blind spots; Opus, Kimi and GLM. The last two run as teammates through a Haiku proxy and custom external agent runner, all three grounds their take with filesystem access and Context7. The team lead deduplicates findings, fact-checks each against your actual codebase, runs cost/benefit analysis on the findings, and outputs a structured report for human review. This loops until the issues flagged no longer warrant mitigation as per the cost/benefit analysis.\n\n**/plan** — Opus transforms the approved design into an execution document so specific that Sonnet build agents never ask clarifying questions. \\~5 tasks per agent, no file conflicts between groups, exact file paths, complete code examples showing the patterns, named test cases with setup and assertions. Tasks are atomic with non-negotiable acceptance criteria.\n\n**/pmatch** — Drift detection, mechanized. Two agents (Sonnet + Kimi) independently extract claims from a source-of-truth document and verify each against the target, checking the plan-vs-design. Team lead validates findings and mitigates if need be.\n\n**/build** — Opus leads, Sonnets build. Uses Claude Code's agent teams so each builder gets its own terminal. The lead never writes code, just coordinates and unblocks, and runs **/pmatch** checks the implementation against the plan after the team shuts down.\n\nPost-build pipeline — **/denoise** strips dead code and noise, **/qf** and **/qb** audit against project-specific style guides, **/qd** validates documentation freshness, **/security-review** scans for OWASP vulnerabilities. Run them as an ordered pipeline or swarm them in parallel against independent paths.\n\nThis is how I ship.\n\n**Key principles that emerged from iteration:**\n\n\\- **Context is noise**. Bigger token windows are a trap. Give agents only the narrow, curated signal they need for their specific phase. Less context = higher IQ.\n\n\\- **Cognitive tiering.** Opus for strategy and design. Sonnet for implementation. Haiku for proxy agents that shuttle prompts to external models.\n\n\\- **Audit the auditor.** The agent that builds the code cannot validate it. Separate contexts for execution and validation.\n\n\\- **Stress-test assumptions.** An idea is only as good as the number of bulletholes it can withstand. Have distinct models critique the same design, exposing blind spots that a single perspective would miss\n\n\\- **Grounding, not guessing**. Before recommending a library or pattern, the system verifies against live documentation, project docs, and known pitfalls. Documented reality overrides training data.\n\n\\- **Deterministic execution**. If the builder has to guess, the planner failed. Test cases defined at plan time, not after the build.\n\n**Agency > Automation**\n\nThe entire system is designed around preserving **intent and agency** against the grain of automated gas-lighting and cognitive offloading. I don't want a magic button, I just want to know what happens when I can finally work at the speed of thought.\n\nPackaging it up for public release soonish. Happy to answer questions about any of the pieces.\n\n---\n\nClarification: some folks seem to have mistaken what is a collection of CC primitives + a script, solidified as second order effect of a years worth of development, for a standalone application it took 3k hours to build. The UI in the screenshot is in actual fact the new native agent teams UI in CC, for those of you who didnt know. Guess I should have been clearer somehow; so deep in I forgot to spoonfeed lol. Been so damned confused wtf people thought anyone would spend a year on a collection of skills.",

Without formalized hand-offs and explicit quality criteria, agents confidently produce work that looks right but fails downstream.

I'm working on a framework myself, a bit similar to this.\n\nFunny how the industry loves frameworks like GSD when it's fundamentally designed to breeze through a project without guardrails in place. I guess people just love wasting tokens on crap only to find out their spaghetti codebases are now a problem of their own.\n\nIf the results are wrong, the blueprints were wrong all along. Get things right from the start, and you save loads of pain down the line. I  think with the capabilities we now have, we need to shift our mindsets on what can be classified as over-engineering these days. Things that used to be out-of-scope previously have no reason to be now. Backlogs should only be a result of real-world planning and approval being blocked. Not because we \"don't have the resources\" to implement the extra features.\n\nIn a world where most industries are saturated with multiple SaaS products, aside from UX, feature-wise, how do you stand out against competitors if you're not offering their customers the same value at a bare minimum?\n\nLong story short, fuck the lightweight, destined to fail MVPs. Simple, loveable and complete is the new way forward. Everyone can launch without funding now, get some users, make some money, then go for funding when it's ready to scale if you want to sell off a part of your business. If your product blows up before that, congratulations, you've just saved yourself some valuable equity in your company.",

Self-certification is basically useless; the agent that wrote the code can't catch its own blind spots.\n\nThe .8% cold-start cost is a real unlock.

If you look at their “premium” seats on their business plans, the premium seats are $150 for 6.25x the Pro plan. So, basically a premium price on top of the $100 Max 5x plan, just to be able to centralize billing. I think that value can make sense for a medium to large org.\n\nIf I was a small business, with say 10 devs, I’d just give everyone a stipend they could use for whatever AI plans they want, just have to upload receipts and expense it. I’d probably set a max of say $500/mo, so if they want a Max 20x plan and a Codex Pro plan, they can get them both, as well as some additional API usage if they hit limits or if they wanted to try open weight models. I’d just ask that they turn off the prompt sharing for training option in their control panel and only use open weight models from providers that don’t retain prompts for training.\n\nIf I was a larger org (say, 50-100+ devs) then either paying a premium for a business plan like the $150 premium seat, or switching to API pricing probably makes more sense. I’d probably just set a soft cap of say, $1,000/mo on API usage per person and see how it goes. Chances are some devs will use more and some less, and it will average out somewhere in the middle. Though, frankly, if they are using the API priced models to do work that’s generating profit, the more the better. I’d also probably invest in setups to run local/self hosted open weights too. Fill a few 8U racks with RTX 6000 Pros and let people experiment with them or buy on demand pricing if I didn’t have the CapEx to pay for the hardware outright.",

Eventually gave everyone the Copilot Pro+ plan, then rolled out $100/mo limit API to everyone on Claude Code via Bedrock, then $150/mo, now $1,000/mo. The amount of dev time and effort, the amount of meetings spent debating how much access to give and to which models on which host, is absurd. They have probably spent several months or a year’s worth of usage in engineer/manager time debating how to limit and how much to limit people to, when we could have been onboarding and encouraging people to use more.\n\nThey finally saw the light and basically unleashed everyone, though we’ll see how long the $1,000 cap lasts.\n\nI understand that the CFO wants to be able to have a budget and be able to estimate costs and such, but what really matters is what you’re using that cost for. If each dev is using $1-2K/month, it seems like a lot at face value, but if you’re a company who is able to turn dev work hours/effort into money, it’s a no brainer. $1-2K per month for an average software dev might approach 10% of their salary in raw cost on the high end. If you can get a 10% boost in productivity, then it’s cool, but if you’re a software company and your profit margins are only 10% or so, you’re probably doing something wrong. (Sure, a young company that’s still looking for product/market fit might not have massive margins, but if you’re a SaaS, you should be pulling in 50-75% profit margins, at least, once you find the fit. Preferably the profit margins should be at least 100%)",

Sorry you gotta go watch more interviews or money show interviews. Claude Code is an unexpected cash cow to add to the ingestion of capital to build the largest infrastructure requirement since in probably the history of the world, that is a quote directly from the founders, though they tied it to a moment in time in US history of the last greatest infrastructure build out. Investors will prop this AI race for 10-20 years, it needs to make no money. So, my issue with these posts is and I am sure you are smart and not a simpleton at all, but these have no reality. \n\nThis is not a SAAS company that got into business to make CC. They love every CC customer, they do. They continuously try to adjust plans for everyone. \n\nA rep blabbering is no different than 50 years of silicon valley sales guys having to leverage anything they can to sell. But that is not the message from the top when they do, or maybe even factual. \n\nAs I posted though many a times here… they could lose all of you, then be ok serving just the customers called Bolt, Cursor, Replit, and you all sometimes fail to realize… in every industry servicing direct end users is way harder than servicing the b2b one to many model… And thats why most of you are upset. Yes, they offer this direct, but so has Microsoft and Google offered direct products and never have I heard someone say… Google is amazing at service, Microsoft wow what an amazing company they are helping me with my plan pricing adjustments and giving me extra for free to help… lol. \n\nThere is no end is nigh, that is click bait or competitive paid bs sometimes on here. But, maybe they choose to not undercut their b2b clients. I just know they are the best company of the bunch to feel like they actually give a crap. And I promise you Boris C will be the first to mention if something massive is gonna go on to toss a bunch of you out the door. And I will put $100 on literally none of the original post being factual without a new way to better serve this market and Max users. $100 bet to anyone when I am proved wrong.\n\nAlso: “their product” is not Claude Code",

No hacks, no shortcuts, no giving up. Add this to your todo list as a reminder\".\n\nThis works through compaction because todo list is kept across compactions always.

This would take me weeks, on my own just to optimize a single thing, just one thing sometimes weeks of frustration. I can have it optimize multiple things now in a 4 hour session. It's kind of mind blowing. I was able to get my compiler 1.8x faster doing this, and the tweaks it came up with were insanely small amount of code changes.",

It can do very non-trivial work, and the only real \"mistakes\" it makes are judgment calls that it made because I didn't specify the functionality with enough detail.

They build more features.\n\nOne thing that remains true and probably always will: if you leave Claude running overnight on a huge spec that Claude helped you write in an hour, it will get it done, and it will have CI scripts for GitHub, test/production environments, everything you asked for, but... now you probably have several days of discovery ahead of you, because the constraints you set in the spec naturally have multiple interpretations, and Claude had to make some decisions. This is going to make you say \"Yeah, I should have made that clearer in the spec\" to yourself about 30 times.\n\nPre-AI my answer to this was: iterative development, make a really simple first MVP, get feedback, make adjustments, and so on, gradually growing out the features as you learn more about what's actually wanted.\n\nBut with AI, every hour you're asleep and you're not using the subscription, that's money wasted! So you _might as well_ throw work at it, and it can handle a lot of work.\n\nYou still have to iterate and adjust because (I repeat) a spec will never capture the things you don't know yet. Some things you don't realise until you play with version 1.\n\nBut the difference with AI is that the MVP (and each successive version) can be a much bigger leap, because the concern is no longer about \"wasting the day building the wrong thing.\" It's about \"wasting the night not building anything.\"",

A few things that made unattended runs actually trustworthy: (1) success criteria in the task itself, not just the prompt — the agent should be able to self-verify before finishing. (2) Blast radius limits on what any single agent can touch without a checkpoint — prevents one bad decision from cascading. (3) File-based state over in-session context — agents that resume from files rather than long context are far more reliable after 4+ hours. The AFK failure mode we hit most often wasn't wrong output, it was agents that silently stalled mid-task with no signal.",

The best way to use tools like CC is to replicate how modern teams build products in the real world (as evidenced by Anthropic's shift towards Agent Teams). If a PM needs to sit with and micromanage Engineers in an actual team, that's an extremely incompetent PM. With sufficient planning (documentation, phases/epics, well-defined tasks with clear success criteria/definition of done, guardrails i.e. static analysis tools, testing requirements, library enforcement etc.) you absolutely can defer the implementation to CC, just as a PM would with their team at the start of a sprint if they were running Agile or similar framework.\n\nOPs question is valid, as vanilla CC will not run indefinitely, even with a clear [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) file, explicit prompt, or even when spawning a team, which is why you do need to run some sort of orchestrator on top of it to properly AFK. You'll also obviously need to have it run sandboxed, properly utilize version control etc. so it's not trivial. Finally (and probably the largest point), you'll also burn tokens, and unless you're doing it effectively, any drift or issues early are only going to compound over time, so proceed with caution.",

It tracks ralph loops visually, it tracks your subagents visually, you can view files or pictures directly in the WebUI.

Best for fixing many linter issues, performance/optimize, etc. The goal is a completely automated process, lead agent generates tasks and orchestrates a team without conflicting file edits. End of cycle briefings and any tasks needing manual review will get backlogged so the agents stay busy on other tasks.\n\n\nNote: in alpha still, any testers appreciated.",

Not a weekend project - full stack with auth, RBAC, API layer, data tables, email system, S3 support, PostgreSQL local and cloud. No hand-written code - I describe what I want, review output, iterate.\n\nYesterday I ran a deep dive on my git history because I wanted to understand what actually happened over those 40 days. 312 commits, 36K lines of code, 176 components, 53 API endpoints.\n\nAnd the thing that stood out most wasn't a metric I expected.\n\n**The single most edited file in my entire project is CLAUDE.md. 43 changes.** More than any React component. More than any API route. It's the file where I tell Claude how to write code for this project - architecture rules, patterns, naming conventions, what to do and what to avoid.\n\nI iterated on the instructions more than I iterated on the code.\n\nThat kinda hit me. In a 100% AI-generated codebase, the most important thing isn't code at all. It's the constraints doc. The thing that defines what \"good\" looks like for this specific project.\n\nAnd I think it's exactly why my numbers look the way they do:\n\nFeature-to-fix ratio landed at 1.5 to 1 - way better than I expected. The codebase went from 1,500 to 36,000 lines with no complexity wall. Bug fix frequency stayed flat even as the project grew. Peak week was 107 commits from just me.\n\nEveryone keeps saying \"get better at prompting.\" My data says something different. The skill that actually matters is boring architecture work. Defining patterns. Setting conventions. Keeping that [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) tight. The unsexy stuff that makes every single prompt work better because the AI always knows the context.\n\nThat \\~30% of work AI can't do for you? It's not overhead. It's the foundation.\n\nAm I reading too much into my own data or are others seeing this pattern too?",

Each layer narrows the context so AI isn't guessing at any level.\n\nThe 43 edits were really about tuning that first layer until the other two needed less effort. Get the base context right and everything downstream gets easier.\n\nThat's actually what I'm building - a foundation where all three layers come pre-configured.

And so the idea that I've seen for the graph projects is that you have a swarm of agents that is responsible for maintaining the graph. No way we could actually provide deep context in an md file. But an md file could maybe provide instructions on how to navigate the graph. The graph thing really has piqued my interest. But I've also not yet tried it. But to the larger point, I think we're definitely getting to the point where we don't need the models to be that much better. We need the tooling and infrastructure to support these models to be much better. Even if they 10x'ed the context size it wouldn't be enough for deep work in our main codebase. And that's why I'm so interested in these discussions about how people are setting up supporting frameworks. That's where the really interesting part of the work - to me - is happening. ",

[CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) is the \"team handbook\" - architecture rules, conventions, guardrails. Then each task gets a clear spec of what to build. The model decides how to implement it, but within those constraints.\n\nThe problems you're describing - creating random .env files, suggesting features nobody asked for - that's usually a context gap. Either the task wasn't specific enough about scope, or the guardrails don't explicitly say \"don't add things beyond what's asked.\"\n\nOnce I started treating every prompt like a handoff to a coworker - full context on what, clear boundaries on what not - the random stuff dropped way off.",

Sections for project structure, conventions, tech stack, patterns to follow, patterns to avoid.\n\nBut the real trick is nested markdown files in subdirectories. `/src/features/` has its own doc explaining the feature pattern, `/src/server/` has one for API conventions, etc. Claude Code picks these up automatically when working in that directory.\n\nThis way the root file covers broad rules and specific context lives closer to the code. Think of it like a pyramid - high-level at the top, detailed patterns where they're needed.\n\n43 edits wasn't about making it longer though. Most edits were about making it *tighter* \\- removing stuff that didn't actually improve output and adding constraints I noticed were missing after reviewing generated code.",

Buy a boat? you could take a vacation, buy a car, upgrade your house.. etc. \n\n  \nSame goes here. What is the opportunity cost to have Peter tied to Sam? from what I heard, Peter is actually being selfish here, his objective is \\*not\\* to build a company he did that already, he just wants to get to market as fast as possible and use an existing infrastructure to do it. I trust Peter 100% and he is going to do with OpenClaw and OpenAI that Palmer Lucky did with FB and DK1 headset.  It gave Palmer instant access to resources to build out faster. Same here, Peter said this is what he cares about most, and the $1B in funds and given existing resources he doesn't have to worry about running a company, he can just build to market. \n\n  \nThat said, Sam has diff motives and eventually he will flip the script and heads will butt and that's when Peter will depart. This happened many times inside of OpenAI that's how we got Anthropic, they were all the original phds from OpenAI that quit over Sam's shit.\n\nMany large tech companies hire someone to capture them so they only work on what you want. Also many times they will hire talent just to prevent competitors from having them even if they do nothing.. is better than helping your competitor. \n\nI think Peter will do good, and if Sam is smart he will merge Codex with OpenClaw and let Peter make the worlds' greatest dev studio. I just want good tools, I don't care who delivers first. So far Opus and Claude Code are king and that is coming from using it since it launched a year ago. I just started using Codex again with 5.3 and I have to say it is catching up fast. \n\n  \nAll in all this is exciting times. OpenAI taking Peter applies pressure on industry to develop more forks, Peter has the resources and star power to make something Elon-level world changing for devs. ",

Sam is Bill Gates, he uses his OpenAI APIs to see a leaderboard of which are the top consumers and which apps they are driving, then Sam steals those ideas and launches it as OpenAI products. \n\n  \nThis is reality. Both companies suck for diff reasons, but to say OpenAI is better because they launched Codex as open source is not entirely true. I like it, don't get me wrong, it is a win for us, but not for the reasons you think. Once adoption crosses CC they will lock it down as competitors will build on Codex and like Cursor did to MS, eat their own lunch. \n\nIt's a nasty market so it will dictate only the nasty survive and OpenAI is the leader in the market so they have the largest target on their back and running out of money fast. Keep eyes on Nvida and their trust level with OpenAI they are the barometer and showing big concerns of late. ",

I was getting some benefits even with the ancient web UI LLM offerings when I couldn't pass them lists of more than about a dozen items without them hallucinating.\n\nBut then I remember, I have 20+ years domain knowledge in various stacks before I even started using AI. \n\nIn our minds, we can't imagine how we used to think early in our careers how bad we might have screwed up if we were gifted AI without the prerequisite knowledge to really utilize it. If you don't already know how to set up proper environments, or have a workflow down, or have a good grasp on deployment pipelines, it could be very easy to have these tools causing you more harm than good. \n\nStill, AI can program multiple agents at once and be hitting near flawless syntax at 30,000 WPM.\n\nThe fastest human programmer is going to take 4+ hours to output the same amount of syntax, assuming an uninterrupted 120 WPM of straight syntax can flow from their brain to their fingers without a typo or second to consider which bracket to use. \n\nThis means, just with pure math, you would be an EXTREME FOOL to even consider that you are some John Henry ass MF and can outwork the railroad machine. It isn't happening. You'll kill yourself trying to keep up.\n\nAll the previous developers and engineers who didn't adopt AI and are still actively refusing to learn these tools are going to end up at the welfare office in a couple years. Or less. \n\nWhat I am really excited for is when these tools actually ARE good enough that Kathy from accounting with zero programming knowledge can roll her own scripts or SaaS offerings - or where companies without an IT department can have a \"programmer\" on-site that produces useful tools.\n\nWe aren't there yet, but those kind of tools and the people who grew up natively utilizing them will likely present an ecosystem vastly different from what we are used to, today. \n\nGUI IDE is dead. If you're still manually opening files to program inside of them in 2026, you aren't utilizing these tools properly.\n\nOur encyclopedic knowledge of syntax and frameworks and languages and related technologies is suddenly worthless. But, our knowledge of systems design, security, integration and deployment, repository structuring, etc.; is now infinitely more valuable than it has ever been at any other point in history.\n\nTech-savvy project managers are likely about to have a massive boon, over the syntax monkeys who were really only useful based on however many LOC they could shit out in their specific domain.\n\nThe days of specialized frontend and backend developers is also coming to an end. I was always \"full stack\" before the name even existed, thankfully, but people who went only frontend or only backend, or who never bothered to learn and understand the underlying architecture of these systems (both for development and deployment) are going to be eating the dust of people who can Rambo projects already. While they are waiting around to find somebody else to manage the project, or deploy it, or design the database schema, it craft the UI components, etc.; somebody else, some guy or girl, will be rocketing past them, uninhibited by such roadblocks.\n\nUnfortunately, most \"vibe coders\" don't have the domain knowledge backing up their design decisions - and some of the ones that do, have a poor understanding of these tools in one direction or the other (ranging from 'AI can't write a single line of coherent and working code' to the 'I am just a prompt or two away from rolling my own operating system!'). Neither illusion is helpful, but when we are looking at people who don't know what an LLM is, how it works, or how to properly prompt and utilize it (within the confines of its capabilities), the domain knowledge itself might not always get you too far.\n\nYMMV, I have had wild success with AI and these tools going back about two years now or more (like December of 2023) - as soon as I was able to use an AI with vision via the API, I had an AI that could grade roofs for solar viability.

I viewed my core skills as:\n\n* Identifying an objective or need for an application or service that isn't met by current solutions (e.g., \"current Internet streaming stations suck and they can't maintain their infrastructure\")\n\n* Identifying the main concepts or techniques that can be implemented in software to achieve the objective (e.g., \"swarm-based Internet radio streaming to distribute the costs over listeners and to improve reliability vs. a single load-bearing structure\")\n\n* Designing the architecture and requirements (e.g., self-organizing swarms that also distribute indexes and serve as seeds; bandwidth conservation to encourage people to seed if they aren't listening)\n\n* Designing, testing, and refining the user experience (e.g., what the UI looks like, how common tasks are performed, and how an app interacts with the OS)\n\nClaude Code and Codex can't do any of that - at least, not if you want a decent result, one that isn't weirdly constrained or unusable for intended purposes. You're better off presenting some reasonably well-developed ideas to Claude Cowork and asking it to analyze and refine, or presenting a specific technical question and asking Cowork to search for existing solutions.\n\nOf course, the way that I developed all of that was via software, and I've developed a ton of skill at coding, factoring, debugging, etc. While I enjoy coding, I never coded for pleasure - it was always a means to an end. Giving up that skill means I can spend a lot more time on the more creative, analytic, and challenging parts of the process.",

That's how all subscriptions are designed and priced whether it's insurance, mobile phone, internet, etc.\n\nIt's not really that odd they want to discourage or ban people abusing the lower price on subscriptions. They for sure knew you and others were signing up multiple subscriptions and switching to take advantage of the lower cost for a long time.  I'm betting it probably hit some threshold they're not OK with and decided to enforce it.\n\nEvery one of these companies providing LLMs as a service are burning through money to capture market.  At some point or another they're going to start turning the screws to extract profit.  I'm expecting that when that happens a lot of the fanboys or \"enthusiasts\" that grabbed onto these things will start falling away or turning to cheaper or lower quality products.",

Because I was very skeptical before I rolled Claude into my stack when I saw people complain how stupid it would get when new models were being released but no, like, it is exceedingly obvious and dangerously negligent.\n\nToday Claude confidently declared that an issue was because my migration branch from elastic beanstalk to fargate wasn’t deployed to fargate. It inferred this because it was reading the fargate logs for the app. Like literally from fresh context forgetting what was happening in the span of a single prompt, it literally executed the cli command to grab fargate logs and between that and reading them just… made something else up so wrong and stupid it’s hard to interpret as anything but malicious. Several mistakes like that in a row in a single session, like, literally before this it tried to set up a dockerfile using an amd64 os for a project that was built on and deployed to ARM. I cannot imagine how you could guess in a less productive way. Absolutely gross negligence relative to their breathless claims about how they don’t know maaaaaybe it’s developing consciousness, whooooo’s to say, we’d like money now please. \n\nSo yeah, uh, this better be in service of unfucking all of that because out of this month of max subscription I have had a single week where Opus was not a liability between the nosedive 4.5 took before Opus 4.6 and the intentional pants shitting that began last Friday as they presumably started spinning up Sonnet 4.6. And make no mistake that one week was really good, I got things done I had had to punt on for literal years, but I cannot deal with a non deterministic tool that is usable a quarter of the time. And I just use it for code, hearing the way people confide personal shit and relinquish the microscopic vestiges of privacy they have left to AI is, frankly, horrifying when I consider that my experience is that it is passingly competent at best for small, extremely tightly scoped tasks and dangerously inconsistent and unreliable most of the rest of the time.",

Instead of roleplaying like they’re a YouTube influencer who just found infinite money glitch for investing.\n\nGuys just: Brew install Claude-code ; claude ; Shift tab + shift tab (plan mode), and make sure to ask Claude to *document* reusable solutions and specs into MD docs. Play around and *share* your experiences, without needing to “sell” it.\n\nWrite what you wanted to write to Claude. For the love of all future developers, albeit it future you or a colleague — before exiting plan mode just drop “update/create MD docs and make sure Claude.md has a brief architecture file overview”.\n\nInstead of chasing the next big plugin. If I may give you all one golden tip.\n\n- Read the darn [release notes](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/releases). \n\nFor example:\n\nSimple performance improvement. Release notes mentioned this week hey we now allow backtick in MD docs.\n\nJust a prompt ask CC “to **auto** generate your architecture overview and summarize all your architecture docs, and detect symlinks make this a backtick command”. What it will do it will make a fixed structure for that in the file’s first line — there. Not a single plugin needed and not a minute wasted on AI written fillers. \n\n```\nmaster-control-repository/\n├── CLAUDE.md                    # This file - main instructions\n├── agents/                      # Agent workflow definitions\n│   ├── 01-requirements-analyst.md\n│   ├── 02-software-engineer.md\n│   ├── 03-code-reviewer.md\n│   └── coding-standards.md\n├── scripts/                     # Userscripts and automation tools\n│   └── gitlab-pipeline-monitor.user.js\n├── overall/                     # Shared settings across all projects\n│   └── .claude/\n│       ├── CLAUDE.md           # Universal guidelines\n│       └── settings.local.json # Universal permissions\n└── projects/                    # Project-specific configurations\n    ├── protest-upgrade/\n    │   └── .claude/\n    │       └── agents/         # Symlink to ../../../agents/\n    ├── project-1/\n    │   └── .claude/\n    ├──project-2/\n    │   └── .claude/\n    ├── project-3/\n    │   └── .claude/\n    └── project-4/\n        └── .claude/\n            ├── agents/         # Symlink to ../../../agents/\n            ├── commands/       # Symlink to ../../.claude/commands\n            ├── CLAUDE.md       # Home Assistant configuration guide\n            ├── settings.local.json\n            ├── check-entity-patterns.sh\n            └── quality-check.sh\n```",

Auto-memory is a great idea. Anthropic tried to accomplish it with just a single paragraph of instructions in the system-prompt. But we've all come to understand for tools and skills that without period reminders (via hooks), instructions in the system-prompt or [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) are useless. I believe that auto-memory is the same: I almost never see Claude use it, even at times it should.\n\nI took Claude's exact auto-memory system and added reminders for it [https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1r2fmuv/how\\_to\\_a\\_reminder\\_hook\\_that\\_works\\_for\\_swarms\\_ie/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1r2fmuv/how_to_a_reminder_hook_that_works_for_swarms_ie/) . With these reminders, I found myself benefiting from much better Claude-initiated auto-memory updates. They are definitely valuable. (I also found myself manually telling it every 30 minutes or so to clean up and organize its memory, because it wasn't doing that well itself. But I don't think this needs to be automated).",

Inject prompts to remember when context reaches 50k, with increasing severity as context increases without tool use. \n3. Interrupts at 75% to run a session consolidation and tidy up. \n\nIt all works, and anecodtally, I would say the memory system works for what I am intending it for. But I also won't have actual conclusive evidence for at least 3 months as to whether the usage improvements outweight the additional context usage - which is millenia in LLM time.",

Being able to arrange data in dimensions that each have their own context is powerful and Claude searching through .MD files isn’t a good way to do it.\n\nPersistent memory models are about the Agent developing recall, patterns, anti-patterns, specific contexts, rules and learnings etc. For myself I don’t just use a memory model that does that, but I use a memory model to move memory outside of (Claude) and make it LLM – independent. Claude isn’t transparent - I can’t read through files efficiently to tell me what it knows and it won’t give me the same answers every time, it’s essentially designed to have session memory and that’s it. Everything else is a desired feature but a clunky upgrade.\n\nMy memory model records performance evaluations between LLMs, handle persistence states for objects that exist outside of my app and data, and helps Claude understand the difference between Claude as a LLM, Claude Code and Claude as a specific version of a tool with a specific skill set optimised to specific tasks. It auto-delegates between models to improve quality, performance and token efficiency, prioritising model-comparisons to build insights and then using those insights to parallelise pipelines, avoid blockages and not make accidental reversions without being monitored.\n\nIt’s not all about memory, it’s about how you access the things you need out of it. It’s about being able to do knowledge graphs and map that over what Claude tells itself, and then use it work out what it’s not telling itself. \n\nYou can in theory perhaps do that with MD files but then Claude risks editing them whenever it gets stressed and panics - and if you have to put lots and lots of guide rails in your system from scratch each time you build projects, you’re either need to host that outside (Claude), or make your memory manager “smart enough” to manage any project.\n\nshodh-memory and MCP etc are being adopted for a reason and it’s not because they’re perfect. It’s because they’re the barest bones of something you can make act like a human that doesn’t forget.\n\nhaving node maps and being able to pull apart the different faces of your data and see when a “circle is circular” absolutely mission critical to almost any enterprise-grade project, especially if you’re handling sensitive data.",

      "text": "I use AI every day - developing with LLMs, building AI agents. And you know what? There are things where AI is still helpless. Sharing my observations.\n\n**Large codebases are a nightmare for AI.** Ask it to write one function and you get fire. But give it a 50k+ line project and it forgets your conventions, breaks the architecture, suggests solutions that conflict with the rest of your code. Reality is this: AI doesn't understand the context and intent of your code. MIT CSAIL showed that even \"correct\" AI code can do something completely different from what it was designed for.\n\n**The final 20% of work eats all the time.** AI does 80% of the work in minutes, that's true. But the remaining 20% - final review, edge cases, meeting actual requirements - takes as much time as the entire task used to take.\n\n**Quality vs speed is still a problem.** GitHub and Google say 25-30% of their code is AI-written. But developers complain about inconsistent codebases, convention violations, code that works in isolation but not in the system. The problem is that AI creates technical debt faster than we can pay it off.\n\nTell me I'm wrong, but I see it this way: I myself use Claude Code and other AI tools every day. They're amazing for boilerplate and prototypes. But AI is an assistant, not a replacement for thinking.\n\nIn 2026, the main question is no longer \"Can AI write code?\" but \"Can we trust this code in production?\".\n\nWant to discuss how to properly integrate AI into your development workflow?",

A regular person cannot even successfully *imagine* the right thing to build.\n\nWithout the constant failing that is part of the try-fail learning loop, junior developers will never become senior developers, and if they somehow do, they won't be the same - they'll be missing something.\n\n\n\n",

Especially with vibe coding tools it’s hard to know who is hard in the Dunning-Kruger curve and who has actual experience and knowledge.. of often the more seasoned software engineers are the ones with the least experience with agentic coding.. not least because it’s only gone from complete slop to “actually working” in the past 6 months or so. \n\nI saw the graph of the creator of MoltBot, Peter Steinberger and it mirrored my own journey precisely:\n\nhttps://steipete.me/posts/just-talk-to-it\n\nYou get taken in, feel like the master of the universe, run 18 instances simultaneously, figure out that the quality just isn’t there, learn and take 3 steps back until you have something that is 20% faster than before but not quite as good as if you had put your own mind to it fully.. and continue refining your approach because you know this is the future. \n\nThe biggest problem for me is that I have nearly perfect understanding of the code that I write myself, at least for a while, because I’ve written it myself and I remember each decision, each trade off and I went at human speed. \n\nThat’s gone with agentic coding. On a normal day you take 200 decisions, but none of really well thought out. You nudge the process but you don’t really control it. If you type the same code 5 times, you think “ok this is DNRY”, let’s refactor. You notice small stuff. You’re re-evaluating earlier decisions. You get a feel for the code. \n\nWith high velocity agentic coding the focus is always narrow. Or way too large. You can read the code, but you have no feel for it or how well it fits in. Decisions are temporary. The litmus test is to go in and debug a complex bug yourself: it’s like you’re working on someone else’s code. There may be comments but they’re 200 commits out of date. You find two separate systems doing the same thing.. then the veil lifts and you realize you should have been working on this yourself more and let the agent do less.. but now you’re lazy and spoiled 😔",

          "text": "I understand the point of the post and I believe many people have had that experience, but in my case the situation was quite different — for very specific reasons. The “AI losing context” part you mentioned in the beginning is something I’ve seen too, but in my experience it often comes down to workflow. My process is very structured: I describe the problem, explain how things currently behave vs. how they should behave, and I always ask for a detailed diagnostic report first. The model scans every relevant line connected to the issue and produces a micro-report before any implementation starts. If I introduce a second problem mid-process, sometimes the model temporarily focuses on the newest context and forgets the earlier thread — but that’s not a failure, it’s just how iterative conversations work. I simply stop it, remind it that there are two parallel problems, and once it acknowledges that and reiterates the first issue, I always ask again for a micro-report that covers the implementation impact of both fixes together before moving forward. With that level of guidance, I’ve never had it break my project.\n\nAnd yes — I did have very bad experiences before. With Cursor and GitHub Copilot, where I was exclusively using Claude Opus, my behavior and workflow were identical to what I described above — but it still wasn’t enough. In those cases I experienced at least 10 separate situations where the model literally broke my codebase and disrupted stability.\n\nIn my specific case, the real turning point *was* switching to GPT-5.2 Codex in VS Code. The exact same structured workflow that failed me before finally became stable and predictable. I don’t let AI work autonomously; I frequently stop it, bring it back to the architecture, and keep clear boundaries around what it’s allowed to change. In the root folder of my project I also maintain an MD file that acts as a “law” every agent must follow, with explicitly defined behavioral rules and restrictions. In that setup AI hasn’t created chaos for me — it has accelerated development without compromising the project’s structure. That’s why I don’t see all “AI coding” as the same; the difference between models and communication style makes a huge practical difference.\n\nJust so I’m not misunderstood — I’m not a developer and I never was, but I’m someone who knows in micro detail what I want, how something needs to look, and where I ultimately want to end up. That vision is very clearly defined in my head. Everything I wrote above refers strictly to my work on my own application, which has over 50k lines of code and is so complex that almost every class operates in synergy with others. I hope the Claude community won’t take this the wrong way — this is simply my personal experience while building something extremely complex, and at this point I’m already about 80% through the application.",

          "text": "Posts like this just remind me how far behind the average programmer is from the bleeding edge of what's possible with Agentic Coding today.\n\nThese criticisms applied maybe until late last year - but this year?  Claude Code will run until it meets its verification techniques.  It will loop over itself and check itself for quality, security, common errors, etc.  It will invoke endless static code techniques.   It can run playwright tests and postman tests and iterate on any work it does until the tests all pass (without changing the tests, like it would last year).  Humans can hardly be bothered to run tests at all and instead assume their CI pipelines catch problems.\n\nIt can be told to run, and try to break the system, find bugs, find holes - and it can do this all 24 hours a day - each pass can improve software quality.   First pass maybe not perfect, but 2 passes later? 5? 10?  That can all be done in minutes.\n\nI haven't seen a hallucination since Opus 4.5 came out - 4.6 is incredibly good at staying on task, breaking down problems and tasks into small chunks that compose into sophisticated systems.   Things like Get Shit Done are literal software development engines, all written in markdown that are just prompts and you can one shot complex projects pretty simply with the techniques used there.\n\nIf one can't write high quality code in today's CC/4.6 world than a human, then that's 100% a skill issue.  I see people making these claims who are still using some web ui with copy paste for coding.  I see people using ChatGPT and Gemini or Cursor or CoPilot instead of CC - none of these tools are indicative of the bleeding edge of this technology.\n\nPeople think that just using CC with prompts and in plan mode is on the edge of what's possible - it's not.  The new edge is starting off with a skill that asks what you want to achieve, flushes out all the requirements, ties them to must pass condition (like an api or ux test), writes it all out so it's not forgotten, validates presence of those tests, implements, reviews its work (with different agents), circles back, verifies everything on the list is done, runs quality checks, submits to other agent for final review and auditing, and then at the end of the day stands up a complete test environment and runs the complete suite of API and UX tests against the system to ensure no regressions.\n\nWhat I described just there has always been an ideal way of writing software that I've never seen a human team achieve - but guess what, Claude Code with 4.6 and techniques like [Get Shit Done](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done) can do all this in like 20 minutes and in much higher quality than any human team I've ever seen.\n\nThe people at Github and Google are all dogfooding their own stuff, like AntiGravity and CoPilot (calling Opus 4.6 from these tools is not the same) - so I can see why they're not more productive - but then you have Claude Code which is moving so fast no one can keep up - not even ChatGPT (whose products do suck).\n\nSo if you want to see why people think there's gonna be a massive disruption in tech, you need to learn this stuff - cause it's here and it's been possible and it's catching on fast.   The big contracts that Anthropic have been signing lately (like with Goldman Sachs) are indiciative of how valuable their tech is.\n\nI do believe the others may catch up, but they don't seem to be able to do anything correct (Gemini CLI, Antigravity, CoPilot, Codex) - meanwhile Anthropic just upgrades CC on a near daily basis.",

Still a huge improvement over no AI and a well crafted setup can mitigate many issues.\n2. 80% of the previous time spent is now done with AI. If the remaining 20% takes you 5x more time like you claim, you're terrible at what you do. It might take 50% more than it used to (so 30%), but that should still give you a 3x productivity boost like it is giving me.\n3. Quality vs Speed was an issue in 2025. I feel like the models are on par with most senior devs now if you orchestrate them correctly. People who don't know what they're doing, can still produce trash of course.",

Now I have a different approach: I use the AI for brainstorming, research and structure. Then, for prototyping and styling, and when I'm good with it, I take it piece by piece, one function at the time. Most of the time I know what I'm doing and I can understand if the code is good or not (not always, I must admit 😁). But I'll get there eventually. Not automatically. Working really hard on it. My purpose is not to use AI to do the work for me, but to be my companion in things that can do faster and better than me. So yes, AI can't replace devs yet, and I don't think that's the point, right?\n(Though, speaking as a designer that collaborated with several devs before and the code I received was not at best quality, the constant reply to my design (mostly UX) decisions was 'that can't be done' but you know, AI never replies like this, as a matter of fact it can do anything! So, AI probably replaced devs for me 😆)",

Our old code exercise is trivially defeated by Claude Code because it’s mostly just testing the dev’s basic knowledge and speed. So I’ve come up with a new exercise that relies heavily on spatial reasoning. You have to program a team of robots to deliver packages in a room that has obstacles. It’s a lot like a Zachtronics game, and you get scored on a number of criteria after each attempt.\n\nThe thing is, Claude and Codex generally fail on their first pass if you just say “Look at the level and solve it.”\n\nIf you have them look at the output and try again, they will eventually get a passing score but that can take 10+ minutes and the score is usually pretty bad. And now you’ve burned a ton of your time just to get a bad score. It comes up with plans where robots collide, get stuck for long periods, etc.\n\nBut most humans can look at it and say, “Oh, robot 3 just needs to go up at turn 18 and then go through the top door…” and suddenly you’ve got double the score that the LLM was able to hit.\n\nIn my own testing, I find that I get the best scores when I use a very fast/dumb model and give it a strategy.

It included a regex so complex that a second AI could not correctly escape after other 5 interactions.\n\n\nMy conclusion. Opus is good for standard request only and it completely overthink possible solutions. My request was obviously a 1 shot request and the easiest solution should have been a 1500 line file with a `mv` command for each line. Opus didn't even considered this as a possible solution.",

I'm not a senior dev, but have worked in IT for years, and have been using Claude to explore what to me were just buzzwords before but now make much more sense. Like CI/CD pipelines, modular architecture, Unix philosophy, etc. It helps so much to be able to build at turbo speed as a learning experience, and since work lags behind with tools available, I'm excited to have a head start over everyone as we're finally getting claude / gh copilot enterprise seats. \n\nImo it really comes down to spending extra time planning, breaking down your backlog, adding dependencies and file paths for the AI that's going to complete the task, and completing every task on fresh context. Tbh it feels like with agentic AI we're seeing a return of waterfall over Agile since having a detailed plan is so important, and with a detailed plan you can run the build multiple times and just cherry pick the best results.",

And I'm trying to use what I'm learning in that process where AI does work to then understand why it fails in other cases and how we might overcome that. \n\n\nAt the same time, I also would not say that the ability to generate lines of code is not our real limiter either. Yes, there are businesses where this is the case. But I think for many it is not. I'm still trying to think about the likely ratio, but my feeling is that this second group is larger.  \n\n\nIt is about deciding what lines of code to write. Lines of code as measure of worth has always been a poor proxy. And AI is just making that even more obvious.\n\n\nMy biggest fear is the loss of junior devs. There is good evidence that AI is having the biggest impact from more senior devs. Which is not surprising. People who understand systems and architecture are going to be way better at what has become, essentially, an increased focus on requirements gathering and documenting. But the problem with replacing a team of juniors with a senior and a fleet of agents is where does the next generation of senior devs come from?\n\n\nApprenticeship programs are essential. I get that it's not in vogue to think too many quarters ahead, let alone years or decades. But replacing junior devs now with AIs is short sighted. I guess that's modern capitalism though...",

It’s beyond salvation , instead of becoming mature with time we are … like this . \n\nBut boy I would love to see ai taking all the jobs from tech , at least I would be free from even looking at their ugly faces ever again .\n\nUnfortunately it’s not , I think this is hell and I’m paying for my sins. If the whole past lives stuff is true I was probably a really bad bad person , because this is hell man . Work with tech people is the worst .",

Would simplify the whole remote setup a lot.\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "I've built a bunch of custom skills for Claude Code. Some are clever. Some are over-engineered. The one I actually use every single session is basically a glorified checklist.\n\nIt's called `wrap-up`. I run it at the end of every working session. It commits code, checks if I learned anything worth remembering, reviews whether Claude made mistakes it should learn from, and flags anything worth publishing. Four phases, fully automated, no approval prompts interrupting the flow.\n\nFull SKILL.md shown at the end of this message. I sanitized paths and project-specific details but the structure is real and unedited.\n\n\n## How this works\n\nThe skill is doing four things.\n\n**Ship It** catches the \"oh I never committed that\" problem. I'm bad about this. I'll do an hour of work, close the laptop, and realize the next day nothing got pushed. Now Claude just does it.\n\n**Remember It** is where the compounding happens. Claude has a memory hierarchy (CLAUDE.md, rules, auto memory, local notes) and most people never use it deliberately. This phase forces a review: \"did we learn anything that should persist?\" Over weeks, your setup gets smarter without you thinking about it.\n\n**Review & Apply** is the one that surprised me. I added it half-expecting it to be useless. But Claude actually catches real patterns. \"You asked me to do X three times today that I should've done automatically.\" Then it writes the rule and commits it. Self-improving tooling with zero effort from me.\n\n**Publish It** is the newest phase. Turns out a lot of sessions produce something worth sharing and I just... never get around to it. Now Claude flags it, drafts it, and saves it. I still decide whether to post, but the draft is there instead of lost in a conversation I'll never reopen.\n\n## The meta point\n\nThe best skills aren't the ones that do impressive things. They're the ones that run the boring routines you'd skip. Every session that ends with `/wrap-up` leaves my projects a little more organized, my Claude setup a little smarter, and occasionally produces a blog post I didn't plan to write.\n\n---\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: wrap-up\ndescription: Use when user says \"wrap up\", \"close session\", \"end session\",\n  \"wrap things up\", \"close out this task\", or invokes /wrap-up — runs\n  end-of-session checklist for shipping, memory, and self-improvement\n---\n\n# Session Wrap-Up\n\nRun four phases in order. Each phase is conversational and inline — no\nseparate documents. All phases auto-apply without asking; present a\nconsolidated report at the end.\n\n## Phase 1: Ship It\n\n**Commit:**\n1. Run `git status` in each repo directory that was touched during the session\n2. If uncommitted changes exist, auto-commit to main with a descriptive message\n3. Push to remote\n\n**File placement check:**\n4. If any files were created or saved during this session:\n   - Verify they follow your naming convention\n   - Auto-fix naming violations (rename the file)\n   - Verify they're in the correct subfolder per your project structure\n   - Auto-move misplaced files to their correct location\n5. If any document-type files (.md, .docx, .pdf, .xlsx, .pptx) were created\n   at the workspace root or in code directories, move them to the docs folder\n   if they belong there\n\n**Deploy:**\n6. Check if the project has a deploy skill or script\n7. If one exists, run it\n8. If not, skip deployment entirely — do not ask about manual deployment\n\n**Task cleanup:**\n9. Check the task list for in-progress or stale items\n10. Mark completed tasks as done, flag orphaned ones\n\n## Phase 2: Remember It\n\nReview what was learned during the session. Decide where each piece of\nknowledge belongs in the memory hierarchy:\n\n**Memory placement guide:**\n- **Auto memory** (Claude writes for itself) — Debugging insights, patterns\n  discovered during the session, project quirks. Tell Claude to save these:\n  \"remember that...\" or \"save to memory that...\"\n- **CLAUDE.md** (instructions for Claude) — Permanent project rules,\n  conventions, commands, architecture decisions that should guide all future\n  sessions\n- **`.claude/rules/`** (modular project rules) — Topic-specific instructions\n  that apply to certain file types or areas. Use `paths:` frontmatter to scope\n  rules to relevant files (e.g., testing rules scoped to `tests/**`)\n- **`CLAUDE.local.md`** (private per-project notes) — Personal WIP context,\n  local URLs, sandbox credentials, current focus areas that shouldn't be\n  committed\n- **`@import` references** — When a CLAUDE.md would benefit from referencing\n  another file rather than duplicating its content\n\n**Decision framework:**\n- Is it a permanent project convention? → CLAUDE.md or `.claude/rules/`\n- Is it scoped to specific file types? → `.claude/rules/` with `paths:`\n  frontmatter\n- Is it a pattern or insight Claude discovered? → Auto memory\n- Is it personal/ephemeral context? → `CLAUDE.local.md`\n- Is it duplicating content from another file? → Use `@import` instead\n\nNote anything important in the appropriate location.\n\n## Phase 3: Review & Apply\n\nAnalyze the conversation for self-improvement findings. If the session was\nshort or routine with nothing notable, say \"Nothing to improve\" and proceed\nto Phase 4.\n\n**Auto-apply all actionable findings immediately** — do not ask for approval\non each one. Apply the changes, commit them, then present a summary of what\nwas done.\n\n**Finding categories:**\n- **Skill gap** — Things Claude struggled with, got wrong, or needed multiple\n  attempts\n- **Friction** — Repeated manual steps, things user had to ask for explicitly\n  that should have been automatic\n- **Knowledge** — Facts about projects, preferences, or setup that Claude\n  didn't know but should have\n- **Automation** — Repetitive patterns that could become skills, hooks, or\n  scripts\n\n**Action types:**\n- **CLAUDE.md** — Edit the relevant project or global CLAUDE.md\n- **Rules** — Create or update a `.claude/rules/` file\n- **Auto memory** — Save an insight for future sessions\n- **Skill / Hook** — Document a new skill or hook spec for implementation\n- **CLAUDE.local.md** — Create or update per-project local memory\n\nPresent a summary after applying, in two sections — applied items first,\nthen no-action items:\n\nFindings (applied):\n\n1. ✅ Skill gap: Cost estimates were wrong multiple times\n   → [CLAUDE.md] Added token counting reference table\n\n2. ✅ Knowledge: Worker crashes on 429/400 instead of retrying\n   → [Rules] Added error-handling rules for worker\n\n3. ✅ Automation: Checking service health after deploy is manual\n   → [Skill] Created post-deploy health check skill spec\n\n---\nNo action needed:\n\n4. Knowledge: Discovered X works this way\n   Already documented in CLAUDE.md\n\n## Phase 4: Publish It\n\nAfter all other phases are complete, review the full conversation for material\nthat could be published. Look for:\n\n- Interesting technical solutions or debugging stories\n- Community-relevant announcements or updates\n- Educational content (how-tos, tips, lessons learned)\n- Project milestones or feature launches\n\n**If publishable material exists:**\n\nDraft the article(s) for the appropriate platform and save to a drafts folder.\nPresent suggestions with the draft:\n\nAll wrap-up steps complete. I also found potential content to publish:\n\n1. \"Title of Post\" — 1-2 sentence description of the content angle.\n   Platform: Reddit\n   Draft saved to: Drafts/Title-Of-Post/Reddit.md\n\nWait for the user to respond. If they approve, post or prepare per platform.\nIf they decline, the drafts remain for later.\n\n**If no publishable material exists:**\n\nSay \"Nothing worth publishing from this session\" and you're done.\n\n**Scheduling considerations:**\n- If the session produced multiple publishable items, do not post them all\n  at once\n- Space posts at least a few hours apart per platform\n- If multiple posts are needed, post the most time-sensitive one now and\n  present a schedule for the rest\n```\n",

Wanted to check if your experience matches.\n\nclaude/rules/ files with paths: frontmatter appear to load at startup regardless of scoping (GitHub issue https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/16299). So routing learnings to scoped rules doesn't actually save context tokens over putting them in CLAUDE.md\n\nThis means the only truly on-demand (zero startup cost) destination is auto memory topic files (\\~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/debugging.md, etc.), with MEMORY.md acting as a concise index that tells Claude when to read each topic file.\n\nIn your usage, have you noticed .claude/rules/ with paths: actually behaving conditionally, or does everything load at startup for you too?\n\nYour memory placement guide routes \"patterns and insights Claude discovered\" to auto memory. In practice, does Claude reliably read the topic files on demand when MEMORY.md indexes them well? Or do you find important things get missed because Claude doesn't bother reading the topic file?\n\nWould love to hear if this matches your real-world experience or if I'm overthinking the token cost angle.

We had to set hard limits (15 session log entries max) and force aggressive pruning or the file becomes too noisy to be useful.

I thought AI was supposed to fix this about programming?  It’s 5x worse!\n\nI’m sure some of you have experienced this.\n\nIf I had a read on it, I’d say it’s caused mainly from dopamine overloading.\n\nYou prompt and get results in minutes for something that would have taken you much longer.  Then you do it again. And again. And again. You quickly become addicted, and then after each prompt your brain anxiously awaits the next task Claude is working on to compete.  So even while you wait for tasks to complete, your brain is in overdrive dying for that next productivity hit.  It never gets a break.\n\nSo…. After a few hours of this, I am drained.  Double bad when it’s also interfering with quality sleep as your mind races into the evenings about what you’re going to accomplish in the morning.",

I have to keep vscode open to really be able to review changes well.

      "text": "## TL;DR\n\nI parsed Claude Code's local JSONL conversation files and cross-referenced them against the per-charge billing data from my Anthropic dashboard. Over Feb 3-12, I can see **206 individual charges totaling $2,413.25** against **388 million tokens** recorded in the JSONL files. That works out to **$6.21 per million tokens** — almost exactly the cache *creation* rate ($6.25/M), not the cache *read* rate ($0.50/M).\n\nSince cache reads are 95% of all tokens in Claude Code, this means the advertised 90% cache discount effectively doesn't apply to Max plan extra usage billing.\n\n---\n\n## My Setup\n\n- **Plan**: Max 20x ($200/month)\n- **Usage**: Almost exclusively Claude Code (terminal). Rarely use claude.ai web.\n- **Models**: Claude Opus 4.5 and 4.6 (100% of my usage)\n- **Billing period analyzed**: Feb 3-12, 2026\n\n## The Data Sources\n\n**Source 1 — JSONL files**: Claude Code stores every conversation as JSONL files in `~/.claude/projects/`. Each assistant response includes exact token counts:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"assistant\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-09T...\",\n  \"requestId\": \"req_011CX...\",\n  \"message\": {\n    \"model\": \"claude-opus-4-6\",\n    \"usage\": {\n      \"input_tokens\": 10,\n      \"output_tokens\": 4,\n      \"cache_creation_input_tokens\": 35039,\n      \"cache_read_input_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nMy script scans all JSONL files, deduplicates by `requestId` (streaming chunks share the same ID), and sums token usage. No estimation — this is the actual data Claude Code recorded locally.\n\n**Source 2 — Billing dashboard**: My Anthropic billing page shows 206 individual charges from Feb 3-12, each between $5 and $29 (most are ~$10, suggesting a $10 billing threshold).\n\n## Token Usage (from JSONL)\n\n| Token Type | Count | % of Total |\n|---|---|---|\n| `input_tokens` | 118,426 | 0.03% |\n| `output_tokens` | 159,410 | 0.04% |\n| `cache_creation_input_tokens` | 20,009,158 | 5.17% |\n| `cache_read_input_tokens` | **367,212,919** | **94.77%** |\n| **Total** | **387,499,913** | 100% |\n\n94.77% of all tokens are cache reads. This is normal for Claude Code — every prompt re-sends the full conversation history and system context, and most of it is served from the prompt cache.\n\n*Note: The day-by-day table below totals 388.7M tokens (1.2M more) because the scan window captures a few requests at date boundaries. This 0.3% difference doesn't affect the analysis — I use the conservative higher total for $/M calculations.*\n\n## Day-by-Day Cross-Reference\n\n| Date | Charges | Billed | API Calls | All Tokens | $/M |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Feb 3 | 15 | $164.41 | 214 | 21,782,702 | $7.55 |\n| Feb 4 | 24 | $255.04 | 235 | 18,441,110 | $13.83 |\n| Feb 5 | 9 | $96.90 | 531 | 54,644,290 | $1.77 |\n| Feb 6 | **0** | **$0** | 936 | 99,685,162 | - |\n| Feb 7 | **0** | **$0** | 245 | 27,847,791 | - |\n| Feb 8 | 23 | $248.25 | 374 | 41,162,324 | $6.03 |\n| Feb 9 | 38 | $422.89 | 519 | 56,893,992 | $7.43 |\n| Feb 10 | 31 | $344.41 | 194 | 21,197,855 | $16.25 |\n| Feb 11 | 53 | $703.41 | 72 | 5,627,778 | $124.99 |\n| Feb 12 | 13 | $177.94 | 135 | 14,273,217 | $12.47 |\n| **Total** | **206** | **$2,413.25** | **3,732** | **388,671,815** | **$6.21** |\n\n**Key observations:**\n- **Feb 6-7**: 1,181 API calls and 127M tokens with **zero charges**. These correspond to my weekly limit reset — the Max plan resets weekly usage limits, and these days fell within the refreshed quota.\n- **Feb 11**: Only 72 API calls and 5.6M tokens, but **$703 in charges (53 line items)**. This is clearly billing lag — charges from earlier heavy usage days being processed later.\n- **The per-day $/M rate varies wildly** because charges don't align 1:1 with the day they were incurred. But the **overall rate converges to $6.21/M**.\n\n## What This Should Cost (Published API Rates)\n\nOpus 4.5/4.6 published pricing:\n\n| Token Type | Rate | My Tokens | Cost |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Input | $5.00/M | 118,426 | $0.59 |\n| Output | $25.00/M | 159,410 | $3.99 |\n| Cache Write (5min) | $6.25/M | 20,009,158 | $125.06 |\n| Cache Read | $0.50/M | 367,212,919 | $183.61 |\n| **Total** | | | **$313.24** |\n\n## The Discrepancy\n\n| | Amount |\n|---|---|\n| Published API-rate cost | $313.24 |\n| Actual billed (206 charges) | $2,413.25 |\n| **Overcharge** | **$2,100.01 (670%)** |\n\n### Reverse-Engineering the Rate\n\nIf I divide total billed ($2,413.25) by total tokens (388.7M):\n\n**$2,413.25 ÷ 388.7M = $6.21 per million tokens**\n\n| Rate | $/M | What It Is |\n|---|---|---|\n| Published cache read | $0.50 | What the docs say cache reads cost |\n| Published cache write (5min) | $6.25 | What the docs say cache *creation* costs |\n| **What I was charged (overall)** | **$6.21** | Within 1% of cache creation rate |\n\nThe blended rate across all my tokens is $6.21/M — **within 1% of the cache creation rate**.\n\n### Scenario Testing\n\nI tested multiple billing hypotheses against my actual charges:\n\n| Hypothesis | Calculated Cost | vs Actual $2,413 |\n|---|---|---|\n| Published differentiated rates | $313 | Off by $2,100 |\n| Cache reads at CREATE rate ($6.25/M) | $2,425 | Off by $12 (0.5%) |\n| All input-type tokens at $6.25/M | $2,425 | Off by $12 (0.5%) |\n| All input at 1hr cache rate + reads at create | $2,500 | Off by $87 (3.6%) |\n\n**Best match**: Billing all input-type tokens (input + cache creation + cache reads) at the 5-minute cache creation rate ($6.25/M). This produces $2,425 — within 0.5% of my actual $2,413.\n\n## Alternative Explanations I Ruled Out\n\nBefore concluding this is a cache-read billing issue, I checked every other pricing multiplier that could explain the gap:\n\n1. **Long context pricing (>200K tokens = 2x rates)**: I checked every request in my JSONL files. The maximum input tokens on any single request was ~174K. Zero requests exceed the 200K threshold. Long context pricing does not apply.\n\n2. **Data residency pricing (1.1x for US-only inference)**: I'm not on a data residency plan, and data residency is an enterprise feature that doesn't apply to Max consumer plans.\n\n3. **Batch vs. real-time pricing**: All Claude Code usage is real-time (interactive). Batch API pricing (50% discount) is only for async batch jobs.\n\n4. **Model misidentification**: I verified all requests in JSONL are `claude-opus-4-5-*` or `claude-opus-4-6`. Opus 4.5/4.6 pricing is $5/$25/M (not the older Opus 4.0/4.1 at $15/$75/M).\n\n5. **Service tier**: Standard tier, no premium pricing applies.\n\nNone of these explain the gap. The only hypothesis that matches my actual billing within 0.5% is: **cache reads billed at the cache creation rate**.\n\n## What Anthropic's Own Docs Say\n\nAnthropic's [Max plan page](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing) states that extra usage is billed at **\"standard API rates\"**. The [API pricing page](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models) lists differentiated rates for cache reads ($0.50/M for Opus) vs cache writes ($6.25/M).\n\nAnthropic's own Python SDK calculates costs using these differentiated rates. The [token counting cookbook](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching#tracking-cache-performance) explicitly shows cache reads as a separate, cheaper category.\n\nThere is **no published documentation** stating that extra usage billing treats cache reads differently from API billing. If it does, that's an undisclosed pricing change.\n\n## What This Means\n\nThe 90% cache read discount ($0.50/M vs $5.00/M input) is a core part of Anthropic's published pricing. It's what makes prompt caching economically attractive. But for Max plan extra usage, my data suggests **all input-type tokens are billed at approximately the same rate** — the cache creation rate.\n\nSince cache reads are 95% of Claude Code's token volume, this effectively **multiplies the real cost by ~8x** compared to what published pricing would suggest.\n\n### My Total February Spend\n\nMy billing dashboard shows $2,505.51 in total extra usage charges for February (the $2,413.25 above is just the charges I could itemize from Feb 3-12 — there are likely additional charges from Feb 1-2 and Feb 13+ not shown in my extract).\n\n## Charge Pattern\n\n- 205 of 206 charges are $10 or more\n- 69 charges fall in the $10.00-$10.50 range (the most common bucket)\n- Average charge: $11.71\n\n## Caveats\n\n1. **JSONL files only capture Claude Code usage**, not claude.ai web. I rarely use web, but some billing could be from there.\n2. **Billing lag exists** — charges don't align 1:1 with the day usage occurred. The overall total is what matters, not per-day rates.\n3. **Weekly limit resets explain zero-charge days** — Feb 6-7 had 127M tokens with zero charges because my weekly usage limit had just reset. The $2,413 is for usage that exceeded the weekly quota.\n4. **Anthropic hasn't published** how extra usage billing maps to token types. It's possible billing all input tokens uniformly is intentional policy, not a bug.\n5. **JSONL data is what Claude Code writes locally** — I'm assuming it matches server-side records.\n\n## Questions for Anthropic\n\n1. **Are cache read tokens billed at $0.50/M or $6.25/M for extra usage?** The published pricing page shows $0.50/M, but my data shows ~$6.21/M.\n2. **Can the billing dashboard show per-token-type breakdowns?** Right now it just shows dollar amounts with no token detail.\n3. **Is the subscription quota consuming the cheap cache reads first, leaving expensive tokens for extra usage?** If quota credits are applied to cache reads at $0.50/M, that would use very few quota credits per read, pushing most reads into extra-usage territory.\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- [GitHub #22435](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/22435) — Inconsistent quota burn rates, opaque billing formula\n- [GitHub #24727](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/24727) — Max 20x user charged extra usage while dashboard showed 73% quota used\n- [GitHub #24335](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/24335) — Usage tracking discrepancies\n\n## How to Audit Your Own Usage\n\nI built [attnroute](https://github.com/jeranaias/attnroute), a Claude Code hook with a BurnRate plugin that scans your local JSONL files and computes exactly this kind of audit. Install it and run the billing audit:\n\n```bash\npip install attnroute\n```\n\n```python\nfrom attnroute.plugins.burnrate import BurnRatePlugin\n\nplugin = BurnRatePlugin()\naudit = plugin.get_billing_audit(days=14)\nprint(plugin.format_billing_audit(audit))\n```\n\nThis gives you a full breakdown: all four token types with percentages, cost at published API rates, a \"what if cache reads are billed at creation rate\" scenario, and a daily breakdown with cache read percentages. Compare the published-rate total against your billing dashboard — if your dashboard charges are closer to the flat-rate scenario than the published-rate estimate, you're likely seeing the same issue.\n\nattnroute also does real-time rate limit tracking (5h sliding window with burn rate and ETA), per-project/per-model cost attribution, and full historical usage reports. It's the billing visibility that should be built into Claude Code.\n\n---\n\n**Edit**: I'm not claiming fraud. This could be an intentional billing model where all input tokens are treated uniformly, a system bug, or something I'm misunderstanding about how cache tiers work internally. But the published pricing creates a clear expectation that cache reads cost $0.50/M (90% cheaper than input), and Max plan users appear to be paying $6.25/M. Whether intentional or not, that's a **12.5x gap on 95% of your tokens** that needs to be explained publicly.\n\n**If you're a Max plan user with extra usage charges**, I'd recommend:\n1. Install [attnroute](https://github.com/jeranaias/attnroute) and run `get_billing_audit()` to audit your own token usage against published rates\n2. Contact Anthropic support with your findings — reference that their docs say extra usage is billed at \"standard API rates\" which should include the $0.50/M cache read rate\n3. File a billing dispute if your numbers show the same pattern\n\n\n(Tip:Just have claude run the audit for you with attnroute burnrate plugin.)\n\n\n**UPDATE 2: v0.6.1 — Full cache tier breakdown**\n\nSeveral commenters pointed out that 5-min and 1-hr cache writes have different rates ($6.25/M vs $10/M). Fair point — I updated the audit tool to break these out individually. Here are my numbers with tier-aware pricing:\n\n| Token Type | Tokens | % of Total | Rate | Cost |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Input | 118,593 | 0.03% | $5.00/M | $0.59 |\n| Output | 179,282 | 0.04% | $25.00/M | $4.48 |\n| Cache write (5m) | 14,564,479 | 3.64% | $6.25/M | $91.03 |\n| Cache write (1h) | 5,669,448 | 1.42% | $10.00/M | $56.69 |\n| **Cache reads** | **379,926,152** | **94.87%** | **$0.50/M** | **$189.96** |\n| **TOTAL** | **400,457,954** | | | **$342.76** |\n\nMy cache writes split 72% 5-min / 28% 1-hr. Even with the more expensive 1-hr write rate factored in, the published-rate total is **$342.76**.\n\n**The issue was never about write tiers.** Cache writes are 5% of my tokens. Cache *reads* are 95%. The question is simple: are those 380M cache read tokens being billed at $0.50/M (published rate) or ~$6.25/M (creation rate)? Because **$343 and $2,506 are very different numbers**, and my dashboard is a lot closer to the second one.\n\nUpdate your audit tool and verify yourself:\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade attnroute\n```\n\n```python\nfrom attnroute.plugins.burnrate import BurnRatePlugin\np = BurnRatePlugin()\nprint(p.format_billing_audit(p.get_billing_audit()))\n```\n\nCompare your \"published rate\" number against your actual billing dashboard. That's the whole point.\n",

                  "text": "Obvious Insights\n\nFeb 6 and Feb 7 stand out immediately: massive API activity (936 and 245 calls, ~127M tokens combined) with zero charges. That’s roughly a third of your total token volume running for free, which points to batch API credits, a free tier, cached responses, or a billing anomaly worth investigating.\n\nFeb 11 is the most expensive single day at $703.41, and it’s also the day with the fewest API calls (72) and fewest tokens (5.6M). That yields an extraordinary cost of ~$125 per million tokens, which is roughly 17× the corrected average.\nOverall spending is volatile — you swing from $0 to $703 across the ten days with no clear upward or downward trend.\n\nNon-Obvious Insights\n\n“Charges” and “API Calls” measure very different things, and their disconnect tells a story. Feb 6 made 936 API calls but generated 0 charges; Feb 11 made only 72 API calls but generated 53 charges. This likely means you’re mixing different products, models, or pricing tiers — and “Charges” represents discrete billable line items, not a 1:1 mapping to requests.\n\nFeb 11’s $125/M rate isn’t just expensive — it signals a fundamentally different workload. At standard Anthropic API pricing, even the most expensive model (Opus-class output tokens) wouldn’t easily reach $125/M in a blended rate unless you had an extremely output-heavy workload, were using a premium service like fine-tuning, image generation, or were hitting some other premium pricing tier. It’s worth auditing what specifically ran that day.\n\nFeb 5 through Feb 7 form a suspicious cluster. Token volumes spike dramatically (54M → 99M → 27M) while cost collapses ($96 → $0 → $0). This pattern is consistent with a batch job or evaluation run that exhausted a credit balance partway through Feb 5, ran on free credits through Feb 6–7, and then resumed paid billing on Feb 8. Alternatively, something shifted in your pricing arrangement during that window.\n\nYour cost efficiency has a bimodal distribution, not a normal one. You essentially have “cheap” days ($1.77–$7.55/M) and “expensive” days ($12–$125/M), with very little in between. This suggests two distinct usage modes — possibly high-volume batch processing with smaller/cached models on cheap days, and low-volume interactive or premium-model usage on expensive days. Understanding which mode drives value for you could meaningfully reduce your bill.\n\nWeekend vs. weekday patterns are suggestive. Feb 8–9 (Saturday–Sunday) saw high activity and moderate cost, while the surrounding weekdays are more erratic. If automated jobs run on a schedule, the weekend consistency vs. weekday volatility might indicate that human-initiated usage (weekdays) is what’s driving cost unpredictability.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

Compare against your dashboard's raw token count (not the cost estimate).\n\nAlso check if you're hitting the context caching layer — cached tokens show as reduced cost but full input tokens in the JSONL.

They come directly from the API response usage object — these are server-side counts returned by Anthropic's API. There's no client-side counting happening. What my JSONL records is what the server reported.\n\n  2. That jq command would miss 99% of the tokens. input\\_tokens + output\\_tokens ignores cache\\_creation\\_input\\_tokens and cache\\_read\\_input\\_tokens, which together are 99.6% of all tokens in Claude Code. That's the whole point of the post.\n\n  3. \"Cached tokens show as reduced cost but full input tokens in the JSONL\" is backwards. The JSONL explicitly separates them into distinct fields: input\\_tokens, cache\\_creation\\_input\\_tokens, and cache\\_read\\_input\\_tokens. They don't get lumped together. My audit reads all four token type fields separately and applies the published rate for each. Cache reads are clearly labeled as cache reads — the question is whether they're billed at $0.50/M as published or $6.25/M as my dashboard suggests.\n\n\n\n  claude export isn't a command, either.",

The reason cache reads are so high is because of how Claude Code works within a single conversation: every time you send a message, it re-sends your entire conversation history and system context to the API. On the second turn and beyond, most of that is already in cache from the previous turn, so it gets served as a cache read instead of a fresh input. By the time you're 20+ turns into a session, 95%+ of every request is cache reads. That's actually the system working as intended — the problem is whether those reads are being billed at $0.50/M (as published) or $6.25/M (as my data suggests).",

To get visibility on what's actually being charged, scripts like yours and attnroute are pretty much necessary right now since the dashboard alone isn't granular enough. One thing that might help push Anthropic for more transparency: aggregate findings from other Max plan users, it's hard for support teams to ignore repeatable audits showing the real costs. If you've got friends or colleagues using similar setups, benchmark together and share results publicly (with privacy, of course). Developers posting consistent patterns is often how SaaS vendors actually address these issues.\n\nOutside of the specific Claude/Anthropic ecosystem, if you're doing outbound lead gen or anything that racks up lots of API calls and costs, you might also want to look at platforms that automate top of funnel tasks to keep costs predictable. I can share that as a founder of [salespire.io](http://salespire.io), we've started a waiting list for early users, aiming to address exactly this type of ops and budgeting headache by letting AI digital agents handle sales outreach workflows without the unpredictable token costs or massive engineering overhead. It's still early, but if your team deals with a lot of programmatic outreach or wants to control spend better, it might be relevant.\n\nKeep sharing your findings, deep dives like this are super valuable for everyone navigating unclear SaaS billing!",
