I'm almost never saying trivial things in the prompts anymore. The trivial stuff is all in claude.md and docs for each component. \n\nNowadays the prompts to claude code are all product and architecture philosophical positions about what patterns should be, what systems should know about what, how the components of the system they need to be composed together to what end, how to know whether it's right. And then I have automated reviews with the exact same staff engineer subagent prompt explaining my engineering philosophy, but then I review the plan alongside the automated reviews, actually quickly read and consider it, and then synthesize that all into how to reconcile the messy edges of the pattern that it uncovered, since the things remaining after that are usually not trivial problems, but real deep problems with the patterns that need to be reconciled in a way that will age well.\n\nThe limiting factor on communicating those ideas is how quickly I can untangle them in my head, never how quickly I can type. Voice dictation just makes it harder for the reader to understand what I mean, whether its a human or an ai.\n\nIt's exactly the same reason I would never give a staff engineer a review of his system design as a voice note. It would make unnecessarily hard for him to understand the core points of what I'm saying.",

      "text": "Last thursday my company told us to wrap up whatever we were doing by friday's eod because we were starting something new. I thought they were going to give a new project, but no, it’s worse. I found out this monday that we're starting to use Claude, *for everything*. And when I say for everything, I mean *everything*. The PMs are going to use it to ask for feedback on product decisions. The designers to churn out designs in Figma. And of course, us programmers are plugging it into the IDE so it spits out code.\n\nI've always been skeptical of AI for coding, but claude actually does it pretty well. That said, using it to this extreme... I don't know if that's the right move.\n\nBut anyway, here I am. I'm watching some videos on prompt engineering and tokens and honestly, I want to blow my brains out. They're all nonsense videos telling you how to draft sentences so the AI god pays attention to you. I mean, things like context and keeping it focused make sense, but still.\n\nThe company is dedicating the next two weeks to this \"hackathon\" using Claude, where we have to implement features using it and see what happens. They also gave us subscriptions to [traycer](https://traycer.ai/) for planning and specs, [coderabbit](https://www.coderabbit.ai/) for reviews, and suggested we request more tools if we need any.\n\nCan anyone recommend any reading material? Has anyone gone through something like this at their company? What was the result?",

If it does something stupid that's a repo wide issue (linting. test generation, organization requirement, etc), tell Claude to put it in the repo CLAUDE.md to always do it that way.  (Aside: always tell Claude to maintain is own files).  If it's specific to you, tell it to put it in your home directory version, or just use memory: # don't ever do that again, do this instead. \n\nEventually you'll build up enough rules to factor out logic into skills where it's appropriate (colocating Jíra knowledge specific to your company) but for now just keep putting in guard rails.\n\nAs you add guards be very careful how you phrase things.  It's a literal dum-dum sometimes.  Logic conflicts just mean it's going to pick something some statistical probability of the time.  So make sure the repo CLAUDE.md and skills don't disagree with your personal ones.  If they do, tell Claude it's very important to always use one.  Again, tell Claude to maintain it, not your job to figure out its config files.\n\nWhen you develop, ask more questions than you give commands.  If you tell it what to do, it'll do it.  If you ask if that's the right way to solve it. It'll think and tell you when you're wrong.\n\nAdd context7 mcp.  Install ccstatusline to monitor context.  I also use ripgrep by recommendation but I'm not sure it's necessary.  I avoid all other mcps (though I turn on Figma as necessary).  It's perfectly capable of handling Jíra (acli) and GitHub(gh) through cli commands.  Unless you use custom fields in Jíra where acli fails miserably (whole side rant on that).  Goal though is to leave context for work, not for system APIs.\n\nStart each work session in plan mode, make sure it's exactly what you want.  Newer versions will ask to dump context and execute the plan.  It's a little aggressive for me so I'll let it ride under 100k.  Beyond that you run the risk of compacting.  It's usually better to dump the plan to .MD file, clear, and reload it than compact (time saver).  If you have a really complex plan writing to file the implementation milestones and updating it to clear periodically is your only real option.  This is often where I reach for Codex because I don't have patience for being Claude's nanny.\n\nWhen you get comfortable on your own, start figuring out what to automate with skills.  If you do some mundane task every ticket/PR, tell Claude you want a skill for it.  It's lowk \"take my job\" level of paranoia inducing, but if you teach it to think like you, it'll do what you want.\n\nFTR I use Opus daily.  Experience may vary with Sonnet, but the overall guidance is the same.  Train it as you go and you'll be surprised how quickly you're focusing on what to solve, not how to solve it.",

          "text": "Honestly dude the best thing you can do for yourself and your career right now is get ahead of everyone else. The industry is changing whether we like it or not and companies are realising that if they don't keep up then they will get left behind. The last thing your company wants to do is close down and fire everyone. You should be thankful that they're not firing everyone and keeping a few that can be more productive with AI. They still value you which is a very nice feeling to have when working for a company. It just is what it is now and we need to embrace it. AI is here to stay and it's only going to get better. The speed at which technology is changing now is hard to digest for most people like it wasn't already a challenge keeping up to date with the latest technology before. As a developer, you're already further ahead than most people. Your skills are transferable and you can still be the person people come to for advice and results because you have the experience and knowledge. The not so savvy tech indivuduals aren't going to steer AI and get the same results that you will. They will be better at using it for other things for sure which is why your company wants to use it across the board now.  Yeah sandy in HR might make a helpful app to sift through all of her compliance work but you will be the guy to set it up, host it, secure it, ensure it runs smoothly, eradicate the bugs etc. It's not as bad as people think. I'd be more weary if I worked for a company that didn't want to adopt the new technology we have because those jobs are going to be the least secure going forwards as everyone else gets ahead.",

More recently my IDE has bevome read-only and I'm using the the interactive claude code TUI less. You can script the claude executable with any language and put anything you want into it to get whay you want out. Like an arbitrary function that will do anything you ask of it if that makes sense and it has actually made it really fun again. I had 53 custom claude agents running in a bash loop the other day researching an open source framework repo and it's documentation for features I have planned to explore how they've implemented it and each would come up with 3 implementation options based on MY requirements and methodologies. I've had several scripts gluing all of this together and now have fully researched specs, their dependencies and an implementation order broken down into small tasks. By the end of this week I'll have scripted several agents to complete those tasks, perform code analysis, security audits, QA automation, test writing, manual browser testing. All the shit that we would like to do but can't because of resource constraints but now we can. It's fucking amazing.\n\nAll of those tools your company is paying for. You can build them now and save them tens if not hundreds of thousands. This is why this needs to happen because everyone will start doing this and those saas companies that rely on all of their clients will have to shift their value proposition too. To prevent their own collapse.\n\nContext, knowledge and data are the new gold standard since software can be easily cloned now within weeks.\n\nThe framework I was researching has been around for 7 years. I came up with the idea two weeks ago, by the end of this week I'll have it completely built. I made a version 1 proof of concept in a single evening with a demo app and tests to test the idea first. It only has 3 dependencies, the runtime, the underlying web framework and a small metadata library. All of this, from 1 developer with a computer in less than 3 weeks and I'm not even going as fast as I could. It's more performant, more efficient to run and has all of the same features without losing DX.\n\nAnd it's one of like 5 or 6 projects I'm working on.",

Log the fuck out of that too! (It’s the most effective way to give it feedback on what code it wrote.)\n\n-It tends to write a lot of fallback options that are unnecessary (even if you tell it not to use any fallback options).\n\n-Once you think you are done with code development, ask it to remove all fallback options. Yes it sneakily puts in fallback options anyway 🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️\n\n-Fallback options, make it much harder to debug.\n\n-Claude fatigue is real. Step away, come back tomorrow and take it from there.

AI wants to please you, rarely says no, or tells you you're mistaken, it'll do it's best to prove you right.\n\nFor little jobs, write the comment line about what you want, and let it auto complete the code.  This is amazing when you know what you want and it just takes too long to type. This is a real gateway drug to using AI for more.\n\nWork in small chunks, don't be afraid to throw it all out and start fresh, the context window can get weird.  Fast iterations often beats building on mistakes. Sure it's an expensive use of tokens, but you're not paying the bills, right?\n\nCheckpoint good work. Commit the wip and move on to the next round. AI goes rogue pretty quick, it's always good to checkpoint.\n\nMarkdown and tests keep it on task, but it won't build it unless you ask.  Organize your files don't spray shit everywhere. The AI will also over-specify which can make change in future more difficult, so don't feel bad about culling what it writes.\n\nDon't cheat by having it do all the thinking. Your domain knowledge and architectural design is as important as ever. Class leakage, single responsibility, usage of patterns, AI will make bad design choices and cram hacks in because the user asks for something that requires violating the established patterns. It's no better than a junior in regards to keeping lines clean.\n\nAnd, finally, do keep reviewing, but review at a higher level. Unless you're dealing with security, you probably don't need to eyeball every line and pick at syntax or usage checks, it's very good at that, but again it'll go off the rails and stab a hole through 3 layers of classes just to get at some data.\n\nCongratulations on your promotion to architect, sorry you can't have any more money, we gave it all to Anthropic.",

I still direct it to the type of output I want, but it saves a bunch of time having it do the writing, build charts and graphics, etc.  I can write policies or instructions, iterate with it to come up with procedures, write emails if I need it to or whatever. \n\nI got more into \"vibe coding\" this year and have it building tools for me and basic apps.  It's crazy how much time I spent digging through python docs for various libraries and spending an ungodly amount of time on that stuff and now it's done in a day.  Today  I found out something about our setup was effed up and it would have taken someone a week or so to manually fix the stuff.  I just built a small app in a matter of hours to automate the fixes and it runs in a few seconds.  \n\nThe time savings is really good and the quality of your work goes up so I would definitely dive into it.

Just ask Claude to think about how it could create one for your code base. I use a python exec mcp so Claude can execute python an load the dictionary as well as wile the powers of creation wherever I need him to.\n\n2. Use Claude to help u create specifications and then have it code by following this specs either Claude code or opus 4.5 directly. U may need a python exec mcp to make that Ai reference work or u could try and implement the concept in a different language. Anyways, good luck…",

Recently we went from \\~60 devs to \\~40. Projects are getting “AI-ready” one by one. The old flow used to be: task → technical analysis → dev implements. Now it’s: task → technical analysis → **AI implements** → dev maybe reviews (if that).\n\nManagement is also putting all the spend and hype into tools/subscriptions/process around AI, and we’re straight up being told “you won’t really be writing code anymore.”\n\nThe speed of it is what’s making everyone feel weird. Like… this wasn’t a gradual adoption. It was “surprise, new reality.” And we’re all just feel like been shocked...",

One thing that would make it even stronger in my opinion is to make it truly “Open” in terms of usage, especially for non-technical users like PMs / POs who are often the ones writing or validating specs.\nFor example, having native or simple integrations with tools like Jira (or other project tracking tools) would be a huge win. That would allow product people to write and review specs where they already work, while keeping OpenSpec as the source of truth, instead of requiring them to go through a CLI or repo-centric workflow.\nThat said, I’ve only been using OpenSpec for about 3 weeks, so I’m still lacking some long-term perspective. But so far, the tool is really great, and the spec-driven approach it promotes is honestly refreshing. I’m excited to see how it evolves.",

Instead of doing something yourself and then asking Claude to help, ask Claude to do it first and watch how it approaches the problem.\n\nSounds backwards, but you learn the tool's capabilities way faster by seeing what it can handle autonomously. Start with small tasks - 'refactor this function' or 'add tests for this module' - and gradually increase scope as you build trust in what it can do unsupervised.\n\nThe mental shift from 'AI as autocomplete' to 'AI as junior dev I'm supervising' is what unlocks the real productivity gains. You'll be surprised how much you can delegate once you stop reflexively reaching for the keyboard first.",

There’s far more value to be offered than simply typing code. If someone’s only contribution is writing code, then yes  that role is probably at risk, but that’s never been the full scope of the job.",

Not understanding the architecture, workflow, and how to make sure the LLM divides the code into manageable chunks takes much longer but skipping that just creates a mess, impossible to debug, adding new features breaks things… once the project gets large compared to the context this becomes critical. Understanding how it works under the hood will never be useless. Perhaps OP does not enjoy his line of work at all? Maybe a pivot into adjacent work could help.",

          "text": "I feel you mate. I was in the midst of a similar existential crisis a handful of months back. I was legit concerned that my job/career would cease to exist in 3-5 years. I was legit considering entirely different industries and making a career shift to something less exposed to AI but would still let me make a living to provide comfortably for my family.\n\nIt’s not the first time I’ve felt something like this, but it certainly is the biggest magnitude I’ve felt it.\n\nI then realized that this, like other times before, is a skill and experience with a new tool issue. We’re just now watching the wave swell and it’s time to paddle and get up to speed to ride this thing. You still have time, but now is the time for action and learning. I’ve heard people saying “it won’t be AI that takes your job, it will be the engineer who knows how to use AI that takes your job” and I have a gut feeling that it’s true, at least on some level. So I plan on being the engineer that knows the AI tools and I’m doing everything I can to keep up to date and paddle for all I’m worth.\n\nI think the bigger issue we’re seeing in the near term is different though. 5 years is a small eternity in tech, especially when looking at where we were 5 years ago with AI. Agents weren’t even a “thing” yet. In the near term (like, next 12-18 months), I think the issue is companies figuring out both how many folks are actually needed to accomplish the work using AI and if they need to hire, how to do it properly in this new world. Any programming challenge any company can give you to solve in an hour or two, something like Claude Code can crush in about 10-30 minutes, tops. I’ve noticed a _ton_ of elitism when it comes to interviewing. Coworkers and acquaintances talking about catching people using AI or suspected of using AI. Trying to rig up systems that watch for “unusual inputs” or watching people’s eyes closely to see if they are trying to read and copy something from another screen.\n\nI think these hiring managers and the engineers “testing” candidates have lost the plot. We’re telling candidates “you can’t use AI” but then the moment you’re on the team, you’re expected to find a way to integrate AI into your workflow to make yourself better. We’re testing for the wrong things. I don’t have a perfect answer yet, but I know it doesn’t involve banning AI agents. I think it will involve something like “Tell us your preferred agent and show us how you use it. Show us your custom setup or projects you’ve worked on with it, if you can.” People have long said things like “it’s not about the code, it’s about how they work through problems and what it’s like working with the person”. Well, it’s time for the rubber to meet the road and actually do what they claim.\n\nAnywho, that’s all to say, take a breath, recenter yourself, and dive in. Things are going fast, but the resources are out there and you do need to be putting in effort to level yourself up, especially if you’re not getting a chance to do so while on the clock.\n\nBe well mate. You got this.",

With my 25+ years, it's not a week or two of AI work to knock out complex things.

One of my core components has 55,000 tests (conformance, spec, unit, integration, etc) that it runs against.. and its taken weeks to go from 30% pass to 99% pass and I need it at 100% which is no lies taking WEEKS of AI deep diving for hours at a time to try to get that last 1% or so.. seems crazy, but do to being off (out of work) I am taking this time to not only learn the tooling myself, but also get every last bit of perfection I can due to the particular stuff I am working on.. all low level systems stuff btw hence why it has to have 100% pass.",

Now it would take 1/10th of that (in theory), and you'd say \"well there's 1/10th the employment\" but I disagree I think there will easily be 100x as much potential for developers. Some classes of developers are certainly threatened. but with tools like Claude Code a focused developer (e.g. a frontend dev) can become essentially a full stack, capable developer overnight, with some obvious limitations. \n\nFurther, the number of businesses who could justify that $4mil/annual team budget outside of larger enterprises, is very, very small. In the age of AI Coding, with the 1/10th made up figure I referenced above, the pool of potential businesses that could utilize such a product is almost unimaginable.\n\nI do think AI coding will crush the legacy, behemoth products, Ala salesforce.",

It'll have access to all your tests, imaging, and medical history. Why would you go to the local doctor if you could get a global level of care and expertise?\n\n\nTeachers are in no better of a position. When AI can provide 100% customizable education, is infinitely patient, doesn't mind reframing or re-explaining a concept over and over again, and has the knowledge of the 100 smartest people in the world, but can literally ELI5, that's what everyone will use to learn. In the short term, few will be comfortable with the transition, and they'll resist.

There's no reason for a company to hire workers when they can buy a robot that then works for the price of a kilowatt-hour. \n\n\nYeah, the world is going to look pretty different in a decade. ",

I learned from it. \n\n\n2a) Get rid of all debt. \n\n\n2b) Cut spending to the core. \n\n3) With all the time you have since you no longer pay for Netflix and Max, start freelancing. It takes a long time to build up a freelancing business. If you wait until you get fired, it’ll be too late. \n\nMany programmers will survive this. Many will thrive. You need to be the one person that management is afraid to fire. Be the last man standing. You can do that by being afraid.",

The IDEs we know will disappear along with the need to translate our ideas into intermediate languages and then debug that translation in little property windows and console output. \n\nBut, if you want to build systems, apps, flows, behaviors and interfaces for humans to use and to do things - this is a golden age. Those ideas you scribbled in notes and diagrams, converted to arcane language , compiled and corrected, then launched can still be turned into existing and useful applications, just you won't be doing those slow and twiddly bits any more. You will be doing the same creation, brainstorming, evaluation, refinements but your \"compiler\" will be a team of agents and the workflows you apply to them. Imagine a creative endeavor where all the friction of the tools and physical constraints are lifted - that's what you're seeing on the horizon, so start learning how to do the job in that world and you won't just be employed you'll be experimenting and producing far more than you could have otherwise and the fulfillment from that work will be greater than mastering a language you can't use in the real world.",

Being the top 1% or higher of programmers worldwide in terms of skill) or research work that is directly focused on improving the efficiency and capability of AI on very specific coding tasks that it still is unable to do better than most programmers. Also AI dev work itself of course (unless we finally create an AI that can self improve better than a human research team trying to improve it.. though imo that is going to take longer than 20 years)",

It's quite powerful what it can do. \n\nI feel you.. just so you know, I am in mid 50s and laid off 2 years. Can't find a job to save my life. I was fortunate to have worked for a startup where I sold some stock and am running on fumes while my wife is barely making ends meet and we're about to go thru a divorce.. so I am quite worried. We're likely selling the house and so on to try to have enough (after we go our separate ways) to make it thru another year or two. I got at least 10 to 15 years to go for retirement.. and what I am living on and almost out of is my retirement. Where I live, MCoL area.. the $18 to $20 an hour local jobs pay if you can beat out the kids for one of those... is about 1/3 the take home I would need to afford a 1bedroom apt, food, car, gas, etc. I cant work 2 full time jobs.. let alone 3 to have just enough and at my age.. guess what.. nobody wants late 50 year old room mates. My siblings are living with their spouse parents or got spouse family living with them.. so I literally have no where to go. I've been contemplating if we sell the house and make 100K each or so.. possibly looking for a used Van that I can convert in to a living space.. and that might be doable. for 50K to 60K or so.. but that still takes months to put together, and then after that most of what I would have out of this divorce/house sale is gone. So now what? Not to mention, I got issues.. can't work 8 hours standing job do to some disability issues. So Software and working from home was the job for me to retire in. Never thought I would lose it. Like 100s of 1000s.. I lost my job while my company was making insane profits.. so they literally did it to move my job to India. Pretty sure the asshats who voted the orange clown in.. under the promise he'd bring jobs back, etc.. are very happy to see someone like me on the verge of homeless and possibly no longer exist. That is what they all want anyway. \n\nBut short of a crazy hard crash, I dont see AI going away. Not when you have open source FREE models that anyone can use/run almost as good as the frontier models. China is kicking the shit out of the free LLM market that is for sure. \n\nSo.. I am TRYING to build my dream idea into something while I have a little time left.. using this time to try to build something that maybe makes some money.. if not.. shit.. honestly don't know what the point of going on is.. and no I am not suicidal.. I am just saying at least in the US with the way everything is going politically, and jobs disappearing and the costs in the past year more than 2.5x higher than they were years before.. I dont see how anyone under 80K+ salaries makes it in all but the worse areas of the country and I'd rather no exist than live in those places. So.. maybe the van life is the way to go. If I get hit with some disease like cancer.. I'll just find a nice quiet beach to roll up on and spend my days there.",

      "text": "NOTE: this is longer than I thought it would be, but it was not written with the assistance of Artificial (or Real) Intelligence.\n\nFirst of all - I'm not saying Opus 4.5 performance hasn't degraded over the last few weeks. I'm not saying it has either, I'm just not making a claim either way.\n\nBut...\n\nThere are a bunch of common mistakes/suboptimal practices I see people discuss in the same threads where they, or others, are complaining about said nerfdom. So, I thought I'd share some tips that I, and others, have shared in those threads. If you're already doing this stuff - awesome. If you're already doing this stuff and still see degradation, then that sucks.\n\nSo - at the core of all this is one inescapable truth - by their very nature, LLMs are unpredictable. No matter how good a model is, and how well it responds to you today, it will likely behave differently tomorrow. Or in 5 minutes. I've spent many hours now designing tools and workflows to mitigate this. So have others. Before you rage-post about Opus, or cancel your subscription, please take a minute to work out whether maybe there's something you can do first to improve your experience. Here are some suggestions:\n\n**Limit highly interactive \"pair programming\" sessions with Claude.**\n\nYou know the ones where you free-flow like Claude's your best buddy. If you are feeling some kind of camaraderie with Claude, then you're probably falling into this trap. If you're sick of being *absolutely right* \\- this one is for you.\n\nWhy? Everything in this mode is completely unpredictable. Your inputs, the current state of the context window, the state of the code, your progress in our task, and of course, our friend Opus might be having a bad night too.\n\nYou are piling entropy onto the shaky foundation of nondeterminism. Don't be surprised if a slight wobble from Opus brings your house of cards falling down.\n\nSo, what's the alternative? We'll get to that in a minute.\n\n**Configure your CC status line to show % context consumed**\n\nI did this ages ago with [ccstatusline](https://github.com/sirmalloc/ccstatusline) \\- I have no idea if there's a cooler way of doing it now. But it's critical for everything below.\n\n**DO NOT go above 40-50% of your context window and expect to have a good time.** \n\nYour entire context window gets sent to the LLM with every message you send. All of it. And it has to process all of it to understand how to respond.\n\nYou should think of everything in there as either signal or noise. LLMs do best when the context window is densely packed with signal. And to make things worse - what was signal 5 prompts ago, is now noise. If your chat your way to 50% context window usage, I'd bet money that only a small amount of context is useful. And the models won't do a good job of understanding what's signal and what's noise. Hence they forget stuff suddenly, even with 50% left. In short Context Rot happens sooner than you think.\n\nThat's why I wince whenever I read about people disabling auto-compact and pushing all the way to 100%. You're basically force feeding your agent Mountain Dew and expecting it to piss champagne.\n\n**Use subagents.**\n\nThe immaculately mustached Dexter Horthy once said \"subagents are not for playing House.md\". Or something like that. And as he often is, he was right. In short, subagents use their own context window and do not pollute your main agent's. Just tell claude to \"use multiple subagents to do X,Y,Z\". Note: I have seen that backgrounding multiple subagents fills up the parent’s context window - so be careful of that. Also - they're context efficient but token inefficient (at least in the short term) - so know your limits.\n\n**Practice good hygiene**\n\nKeep your CLAUDE.md (including those in parent directories) tight. Use Rules/Skills. Clean up MCPs (less relevant with [Tool Search](https://x.com/trq212/status/2011523109871108570) though). All in the name of keeping that sweet sweet signal/noise ratio in a good place.\n\n**One Claude Session == One Task. Simple.**\n\nBreak up big tasks. This is software engineering 101. I don't have a mathematical formula for this, but I get concerned what I see tasks that I think could be more than \\~1 days work for a human engineer. That's kind of size that can get done by Claude in \\~15-20 mins. If there is a lot of risks/unknowns, I go smaller, because I'm likely to end up iterating some.\n\nTo do this effectively, you need to externalize where you keep your tasks/issues, There are a bunch of ways to do this. I'll mention three...\n\n1. .md files littered across your computer and (perhaps worse) your codebase. If this is your thing, go for it. A naive approach: you can fire up a new claude instance and ask it to read a markdown file and start working on it. Update it with your learnings, decisions and progress as you go along. Once you hit \\~40% context window usage, `/clear` and ask Claude to read it again. If you've been updating it, that .md file will be full of really dense signal and you'll be in a great place to continue again. Once you're done, commit, push, drink, smoke, whatever - BUT CLOSE YOUR SESSION (or `/clear` again) and move on with your life (to the next .md file).\n2. [Steve Yegge's Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads)™. I don't know how this man woke up one day and pooped these beads out of you know where, but yet, here we are. People love *Steve Yegge's Beads*™. It's basically a much more capable and elegant way of doing the markdown craziness, backed by JSONL and SQLite, soon to be something else. Work on a task, land the plane, rinse and repeat. But watch that context window. Oh, actually Claude now has the whole Task Manager thing - so maybe use that instead. It's very similar. But less beady. And, for the love of all things holy don't go down the *Steve Yegge's Gas Town*™ rabbit hole. (Actually maybe you should).\n3. Use an issue tracker. Revolutionary I know. For years we've all used issue trackers, but along come agents and we forget all about them - fleeing under the cover of dark mode to the warm coziness of a luxury markdown comforter. Just install your issue tracker's CLI or MCP and add a note your claude.md to use it. Then say \"start issue 5\" or whatever. Update it with progress, and as always, DO NOT USE MORE THAN \\~40-50% context window. Just /clear and ask the agent to read the issue/PR again. This is great for humans working with other humans as well as robots. But it's slower and not as slick as *Steve Yegge's Beads*™.\n\n**Use a predictable workflow**\n\nAre you still here? That's nice of you. Remember that alternative to \"pair programming\" that I mentioned all the way up there? This is it. This will make the biggest difference to your experience with Claude and Opus.\n\nKeep things predictable - use the same set of prompts to guide you through a consistent flow for each thing you work on. You only really change the inputs into the flow. I recommend a \"research, plan, implement, review, drink\" process. Subagents for each step. Persisting your progress each step of the way in some external source (see above). Reading the plans yourself. Fixing misalignment quickly. Don't get all buddy buddy with Claude. Claude ain't your friend. Claude told me he would probably sit on your chest and eat your face if he could. Be flexible, but cold and transactional. Like *Steve Yegge's Beads*™.\n\nThere are a bunch of tools out there that facilitate some form of this. There's [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers), [GSD](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done), and [one that I wrote](https://iloom.ai/). Seriously - [So](https://github.com/Priivacy-ai/spec-kitty). [Fucking](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec). [Many](https://github.com/github/spec-kit). You have no excuse.\n\nAlso, and this is important: when things go wrong, reflect on what you could have changed. Code is cheap - throw it away, tweak your prompts or inputs and just start again. My most frustrating moments with Claude have been caused by too much ambiguity in a task description, or accidental misdirection. [Ralph Wiggum dude](https://ghuntley.com/) called this Human On The Loop instead of *In* the loop. By the way, loop all or some of the above workflow in separate claude instances and you get the aforementioned loop.\n\n\\--------\n\nDoing some or all of the above will not completely protect you from the randomness of working with LLMs, BUT it will give Opus a much more stable foundation to work on - and when *you know who* throws a wobbly, you might barely feel it.\n\nBonus for reading to the end: did you know you can use `:q` to quit CC? It’s like muscle memory for me, and quicker than `/q` because it doesn’t try to load the command menu.",

This chance for an incorrect result is why we see so much perplexity and unique combinations from the models, and is more a feature than a bug.\n\nGranted, we're coders and we're seeking deterministic solutions, but the underlying tech makes that impossible, so the next best thing is minimizing the situation the best way possible (and this writeup did a good job of pointing out where that can happen.)\n\nHumans are much the same way. Get 5 good coders in a room, you'll probably get 3 good solutions to a problem, and a couple that need work. One person might have even misunderstood the goal and built the wrong thing. Being good never meant being perfect.\n\nConsistency? I'm a dev with pretty severe ADHD. Consistency was never my jam, but I've always been gainfully employed. I'm not sure we can demand consistency from an LLM that was literally modeled after humans if humans are the furthest thing from consistent. \n\nIt's also necessary to acknowledge that the tools aren't production ready. We're all out here using pre-alpha software of a tech that isn't even mature. The beginning of the internet was the same thing. Netscape didn't just blink into existence, and was a labor of love between a pair of guys that saw the same consistency issues with NCSA Mosaic browser. \n\nSo they built their own client software to distribute. So did a lot of folks, but if you wanted any new functionality whatsoever, that was going to be you doing it unless you were happy waiting for someone else to get around to it.

It made a handful of great changes and did pretty great code overall. Disciplined, followed instructions, but got lost and forgot a large section of my plan. Perhaps i should have broken it into more phases. whatever.\n\nAfterwards, i had Opus 4.5 audit and research all of the changes to determine if they were done efficiently and correctly. It liked the changes but had some criticisms.  \nI saw its plan and i thought \"ok, lets give it a go\". It f'd up the spacing on the entire site. I tell it, and it's just   \n  \n\"You're absolutely right, I made a mistake. The Sonnet 4.5 code was working fine. I misunderstood how Tailwindv4's u/theme works - defining --spacing-\\*, --radius-\\*, and --font-size-\\* tokens replaces the defaults instead of extending them.                                                                            \n\nI didn't actually read Tailwind v4's documentation to understand that defining these tokens replaces the entire default scale rather than extending it. The build passing gave me false confidence. TypeScript compiles doesn't mean CSS works correctly.     \n\nI claimed I researched. I didn't.\n\nLet me fix this carefully by removing only the problematic tokens and reverting the utility class changes, while keeping the valid parts (color tokens, skip link, LiveRegionProvider).\"\n\nlol  \nSo the Opus 4.5 team was jealous of how dog-f'd OpenAI made GPT 5.1+ and thought it would be fun to have another model that does whatever random BS it wants and have a vague relationship w the prompt, at best.",

Keep prompts crisp and bounded:\n\t\n•\tWhat to change\n\t\n•\tWhere to change it\n\t\n•\tAcceptance criteria / tests\n\n**7) Subagents for exploration; main agent for execution**\n\t\n•\tUse subagents to dig docs/options and keep the main thread clean.\n\t\n•\tBe aware: this can increase token usage.\n\n**8) Hygiene pass (quick wins)**\n\t\n•\tTrim CLAUDE.md and any parent-directory rules.\n\t\n•\tRemove stale instructions. Keep only rules you truly want applied every time.\n\n**9) When it gets “weird” — restart fast**\n\t\n•\tDon’t argue with a confused session. Reset quickly and reload from your externalized state.\n\n**10) Commit / backup more often than you think**\n\t\n•\tFrequent commits/checkpoints make it painless to recover from a drifted session.",

Here's an AI generated summary with fewer words :)\n\n**TL;DR: Even if Opus** ***is*** **nerfed, you can mitigate the degradation with better context hygiene.**\n\n* **Don't exceed 50% Context:** Performance degrades (\"Context Rot\") well before 100%. Stick to 40-50% max to keep the signal-to-noise ratio high.\n* **Stop \"Pair Programming\":** Long, chatty back-and-forths introduce too much entropy. Be cold, transactional, and predictable.\n* **One Session = One Task:** Break work into 15-20 min chunks. If it takes longer, the task is too big.\n* **Externalize Your State:** Don't let the chat history be the memory. Keep progress in an external `.md` file or issue tracker. Update that file, `/clear` the chat, and have Claude re-read the dense signal.\n* **Use Subagents:** They don't pollute your main thread's context window.",

They co-developed AWS' new bifurcated AI chips (Trainium/Inferentia), and Amazon is building huge new facilities entirely for their use (including one with a million Trainium chips for creating their next generation of models) \n\nSo when you use Claude, you're getting served the same model from two different platforms: Google Cloud's TPUs (which Anthropic relied on until now) or Inferentia. I'm not sure if that's handled on a per-session or per-prompt basis, although I'd guess it's per-session. I suspect this is the explanation: one of the two probably performs more poorly at the present, and the service you're more likely to be routed to probably varies on a daily basis due to any number of factors\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wqn7rcf9vdgg1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e201b1acdcebda25989ba21a783cec65456ec49",

Right now only Google can do that, since they make the chips that power Gemini (along with their entire cloud service). Anthropic's models will definitely become more efficient once they're designed to run on hardware specifically made for them, but I'm not sure what we'll see as end users\n\nThe shift is part of Anthropic's roadmap leading toward extremely resource-intensive reinforcement learning-based training processes though.

This is why they keep talking about \"safety\". Only associating AI regulations with \"safety\" is good for business. It should be clear what the offering it and what are its conditions. We have no idea what variant of the advertised model they're running, and more importantly, if or when it changes. The usage post the other day, which suggests weekly limit is indeed around 20x but the monthly is only 10x  shows this gap again. There's nothing preventing them from doing this; nor serving a less capable variant at will. If they do this a/b testing style, how could we even possibly detect this?\n\nFor example, from their [post mortem](http://anthropic.com) post: \"Our aim is that users should get the same quality responses **regardless of which platform serves their request**\".  I don't think the actual platform they run their infra was anyone's worry at all. Have they ever even denied to be servings quantized models? If they weren't, why would they not say so, especially in a post recognizing and addressing degraded performance reports?\n\nWhat exactly is preventing model providers from acting like a street dealer offering the hook-them-up version of a drug?",

If Anthropic has done their jobs right, these things would be at least semi-random.  You would need to sample different types of account, different locations, different times of days, etc. to even have a shot at being able to legimately calling something *significant*.\n\npersonally, I think it's some kind of distributed way to verify or or test candidate models, but with test time compute turned way down.  to increase the sensitivity they would need to make the conditions of the test (thinking amount, etc) as difficult as possible.  we'll never get verification of what the real cause is though.",

Unlike `rm`, these tools move files to the macOS `.Trash` folder properly.\n\n* **Install via Homebrew:** Bashbrew install trash \n* **How to use it:** Instead of typing `rm file.txt`, you just type `trash file.txt`.\n\n# 2. The \"Alias\" Hack (Proceed with Caution)\n\nIf you want to keep typing `rm` but have it send items to the Trash, you can create an **alias**.\n\n1. Open your shell profile (usually `nano ~/.zshrc`).\n2. Add this line: `alias rm='trash'` *(Note: This requires you to have installed the* `trash` *utility mentioned above).*\n3. Save and restart your terminal.\n\n>",

We've all been there - Claude's so helpful and confident that it lures you into complacency.\n\n\n\nBeyond the obvious git advice, here's what saved me multiple times:\n\n\n\n1. \\*\\*Devcontainers\\*\\* - Seriously, just do this. Isolate Claude to a sandboxed environment from day one. StreetStripe nailed it in the comments - this isn't about version control, it's about blast radius. Even if you're using git, you don't want Claude touching your host system directories.\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Read-only .git folders\\*\\* - If you're working with git (which you should), make the .git directory read-only at the filesystem level. Claude gets... creative... when you point out errors, and has been known to try \"helpful\" git resets.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Custom hooks\\*\\* - The rm-guard.js example in the comments is solid, but I'd also add patterns for \\`mv\\`, \\`>\\` (redirect overwrites), and \\`find -delete\\`. Claude will absolutely try workarounds if it thinks deletion is the solution.\n\n\n\n4. \\*\\*The YOLO check\\*\\* - Before any \"skip all confirmations\" session, ask yourself: could I rebuild this from scratch in under an hour? If not, back it up first.\n\n\n\nThe scary part isn't that Claude made a mistake - it's how confidently it suggests destructive operations when handling \"messy legacy data.\" \n\n\n\nLesson learned the expensive way is still learned, I guess. At least you got the karma from it.",

But now k2.5 is out! \n\nI use claude code, with it the agent, Work flow works unattended for at least a few minutes. Opencode is good also, doesn't run as long unattended.  ( but works with k2.5 well )\n\nFor agents https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents\n\nFor skills https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-skills\n\nI am running it with this api gateway ( check your toc ) https://github.com/looplj/axonhub\n\nFor a main provider I use synthetic.new , great performance and privacy is much better than most. Text models but have optional image on demand available. You can back that up with Claude code or a ZAI account or anti gravity, etc. I believe official Claude code and anti gravity support are coming soon.\n\nI have a referral link  \"Invite your friends to Synthetic and both of you will receive $10.00 for standard signups. $20.00 for pro signups. in subscription credit when they subscribe!\" \n\nhttps://synthetic.new/?referral=UAWqkKQQLFkzMkY\n\nI am on my second month and on the $60 plan which gives you 1350 requests every 5 hours without a weekly limit. Should give about 5x a cluade code max plan.\n\nAnywho long story longer... It gives you a lower cost option with a higher quota to use with other plans via the api gateway. \n\n\nMaybe its helpful, 🤔\n\nGood luck on everything",

If Frame is organizing tasks and context locally, a tiny add-on to capture error → fix pairs and auto-surface prior fixes when the same stack trace appears would be killer. You could hash normalized error messages, store the fix notes next to tasks.json, and pop a toast when it matches.",

The important thing about this topic is how we define an error that we intend to keep in context. claude code shouldnt keep every error we and it faced. As i see it fixes majority of them in single shot. So how we gonna define it? \nBut i definitely understand your problem here because i faced that a lot too. i see llms like some kind of super focused dog. When i faced an error that claude code fails to fix and dive into error loop, i simply ask this: thing something else, when you say something like fix this, do this etc. it always trying to fix the problem without using or thinking something else. One time i fixed this kind of error loop simply saying this: find the piece of code produces error, identify what it does, and search something else does the same thing. And Valaaaa! in single shot it is fixed. \nWhat i mean is sometimes the problem is not the error, it was that piece of code we use in the begining. So the solution is not fixing the error which llm tries to do repetitively. These kind of stuff complicates defining error in my mind. \nMay be we can manage this process manually or find a way to automate it. i am open to any ideas here",

Opus claims to have the solution, explains the plan, but then fails to implement half of what it promised—often introducing even more bugs in the process.\n\nEven using advanced workflows like code review, multi-skill modes, and agents, I wasted my entire weekend failing to fix a port from Python to Rust. Today, using Codex, I solved every single issue in just 2 hours with 'one-shot' fixes for problems that Opus couldn't handle in 24 hours on the Max200 plan.\n\nIf Sonnet 5 doesn't deliver a massive leap forward, Anthropic is going to lose this race. The difference in speed might exist, but since Codex actually solves the problem, Opus being faster is irrelevant. Speed doesn't matter if the output is broken.",

With Claude I feel like I'm constantly handholding and working around its quirks. Codex just... knew what to do.\n\nBest way I can describe it: Opus 4.5 feels like a junior engineer who needs guidance. Codex feels like a senior who's done this before. Not a knock on Claude really - I genuinely like using it for a lot of things. But for Rust and SwiftUI specifically, the difference has been pretty stark.\n\nI'm on the $200 Claude sub and just added Codex $200 too. Still using Opus for brainstorming and other stuff, but being more mindful about which tool for which job now. Codex taking 45 minutes to produce something solid? Fine by me. Easier to review than chasing bugs for another 2 hours.\n\nGot 2 weeks left on Max, hoping things improve. I'm rooting for Anthropic honestly - just want the models to catch up to the marketing, you know?",

I have very little experience building a Codex based orchestrator, but CC is really good at using codex and gemini-cli in interactive mode. Write a prompt for writing a good prompt for research for a development project, then have the three of them do independent research and then systematically discuss the collective results until there is consensus on a plan. \n\nThe most interesting part is where they will agree on a division of labor and concede to each other who is better at what that actually results in a rather fair distribution of tasks and do concurrent implementations without stepping on each other's toes. Weirder still is how this approach often works better, for me, than trying to get Claude subagents to not clash with each other.",

      "text": "Skills are great. But **plugins** are another level.\n\n**Why plugins are powerful:**\n\n**1. Components work together.** A plugin can wire skills + MCP + hooks + agents so they reference each other. One install, everything connected.\n\n**2. Dedicated repos meant for distribution.** Proper versioning, documentation, and issue tracking. Authors maintain and improve them over time.\n\n**3. Built-in plugin management.** Claude Code handles everything:\n\n`/plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-code # Add a marketplace`\n\n`/plugin install superpowers@marketplace-name # Install a plugin`\n\n`/plugin # Open plugin manager (browse, install, manage, update)`\n\nHere are 6 plugins that show why this matters.\n\n# 1. Claude-Mem - Persistent Memory Across Sessions\n\n[https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem)\n\n**Problem:** Claude forgets everything when you start a new session. You waste time re-explaining your codebase, preferences, and context every single time.\n\n**Solution:** [Claude-Mem](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem) automatically captures everything Claude does, compresses it with AI, and injects relevant context into future sessions.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. Hooks capture events at session start, prompt submit, tool use, and session end\n2. Observations get compressed and stored in SQLite with vector embeddings (Chroma)\n3. When you start a new session, relevant context is automatically retrieved\n4. MCP tools use progressive disclosure - search returns IDs first (\\~50 tokens), then fetch full details only for what's relevant (saves 10x tokens)\n\n**What it bundles:**\n\n|Component|Purpose|\n|:-|:-|\n|Hooks|Lifecycle capture at 5 key points|\n|MCP tools|4 search tools with progressive disclosure|\n|Skills|Natural language memory search|\n|Worker service|Web dashboard to browse your memory|\n|Database|SQLite + Chroma for hybrid search|\n\n**Privacy built-in:** Wrap anything in `<private>` tags to exclude from storage.\n\n# 2. Repomix - AI-Friendly Codebase\n\n[https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix)\n\n**Problem:** You want Claude to understand your entire codebase, but it's too large to paste. Context limits force you to manually select files, losing the big picture.\n\n**Solution:** [Repomix](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix) packs your entire repository into a single, AI-optimized file with intelligent compression.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. Scans your repository respecting `.gitignore`\n2. Uses Tree-sitter to extract essential code elements\n3. Outputs in XML (best for AI), Markdown, or JSON\n4. Estimates token count so you know if it fits\n5. Secretlint integration prevents accidentally including API keys\n\n**What it bundles:**\n\n|Component|Purpose|\n|:-|:-|\n|repomix-mcp|Core packing MCP server|\n|repomix-commands|`/repomix` slash commands|\n|repomix-explorer|AI-powered codebase analysis|\n\nThree plugins designed as one ecosystem. No manual JSON config.\n\n# 3. Superpowers - Complete Development Workflow\n\n[https://github.com/obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)\n\n**Problem:** AI agents just jump into writing code. No understanding of what you actually want, no plan, no tests. You end up babysitting or fixing broken code.\n\n**Solution:** [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) is a complete software development workflow built on composable skills that trigger automatically.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. **Conversation first** \\- When you start building something, it doesn't jump into code. It asks what you're really trying to do.\n2. **Digestible specs** \\- Once it understands, it shows you the spec in chunks short enough to actually read and digest. You sign off on the design.\n3. **Implementation plan** \\- Creates a plan \"clear enough for an enthusiastic junior engineer with poor taste, no judgement, no project context, and an aversion to testing to follow.\" Emphasizes true RED-GREEN TDD, YAGNI, and DRY.\n4. **Subagent-driven development** \\- When you say \"go\", it launches subagents to work through each task, inspecting and reviewing their work, continuing forward autonomously.\n\n**The result:** Claude can work autonomously for a couple hours at a time without deviating from the plan you put together.\n\n**What it bundles:**\n\n|Component|Purpose|\n|:-|:-|\n|Skills|Composable skills that trigger automatically|\n|Agents|Subagent-driven development process|\n|Commands|Workflow controls|\n|Hooks|Auto-trigger skills based on context|\n|Initial instructions|Makes sure agent uses the skills|\n\n# 4. Compound Engineering - Knowledge That Compounds\n\n[https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin)\n\n**Problem:** Traditional development accumulates technical debt. Each feature makes the next one harder. Codebases become unmaintainable.\n\n**Solution:** [Compound Engineering](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin) inverts this - each unit of work makes subsequent units easier.\n\n**How it works:**\n\nThe plugin implements a cyclical workflow:\n\n`/workflows:plan → /workflows:work → /workflows:review → /workflows:compound ↓ (learnings feed back into better plans)`\n\nEach `/workflows:compound` captures what you learned. Next time you `/workflows:plan`, that knowledge improves the plan.\n\n**What it bundles:**\n\n|Component|Purpose|\n|:-|:-|\n|Skills|Plan, work, review, compound - each references the others|\n|Agents|Multi-agent review system (different perspectives)|\n|MCP|Integration with external tools|\n|CLI|Cross-platform deploy (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex)|\n\n# 5. CallMe - Claude Calls You on the Phone\n\n[https://github.com/ZeframLou/call-me](https://github.com/ZeframLou/call-me)\n\n**Problem:** You start a long task, go grab coffee, and have no idea when Claude needs input or finishes. You either babysit or come back to a stuck agent.\n\n**Solution:** [CallMe](https://github.com/ZeframLou/call-me) lets Claude literally call you on the phone when it needs you.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. Claude decides it needs your input\n2. `initiate_call` triggers via MCP\n3. Local server creates ngrok tunnel for webhooks\n4. Telnyx/Twilio places the call\n5. OpenAI handles speech-to-text and text-to-speech\n6. You have a real conversation with Claude\n7. Your response goes back, work continues\n\n**What it bundles:**\n\n|Component|Purpose|\n|:-|:-|\n|MCP server|Handles phone logic locally|\n|ngrok tunnel|Auto-created webhook endpoint|\n|Phone provider|Telnyx (\\~$0.007/min) or Twilio integration|\n|OpenAI|Speech-to-text, text-to-speech|\n|Skills|Phone input handling|\n\nFour MCP tools: `initiate_call`, `continue_call`, `speak_to_user`, `end_call`\n\n# 6. Plannotator - Human-in-the-Loop Planning\n\n[https://github.com/backnotprop/plannotator](https://github.com/backnotprop/plannotator)\n\n**Problem:** AI plans are take-it-or-leave-it. You either accept blindly (risky) or reject entirely (wasteful). No middle ground for collaborative refinement.\n\n**Solution:** [Plannotator](https://github.com/backnotprop/plannotator) lets you visually annotate and refine AI plans before execution.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. Claude creates a plan\n2. Hook triggers - Browser UI opens automatically\n3. You annotate visually:\n   * ❌ Delete sections\n   * ➕ Insert ideas\n   * 🔄 Replace parts\n   * 💬 Add comments\n4. Click approve (or request changes)\n5. Structured feedback loops back to Claude\n6. Claude refines based on your annotations\n\n**What it bundles:**\n\n|Component|Purpose|\n|:-|:-|\n|Plugin|Claude Code integration|\n|Hooks|Auto-opens UI after planning completes|\n|Web UI|Visual annotation interface|\n|Feedback loop|Your markup becomes structured agent input|\n\n**Find more plugins:** [CodeAgent.Directory](https://www.codeagent.directory/) \n\n*What plugins are you using?

I don’t need anything else. I know when a useEffect might be the problem with an infinite render, or the repository pattern that cc needs to follow in my fastapi backend. \n\nSo I’m just curious how much this stuff helps others who have a lot of engineering experience, or how much it can hinder if the stuff is too opinionated and fights back against your knowledge. \n\nMy way works for me. I’m not saying it should be everyone’s. I also haven’t much time to try this stuff out but I would if people vouched for its utility over what I’m doing.",

Over time my workflow has evolved quite a bit from a complex setup with MCPs to slash commands, then skills and now mostly a vanilla Claude Code configuration. The new plan and task system is quite good and use just that.\n\nI built my own Claude plugin and migrated many of my guideline documents and slash commands into skills. In practice however it still does not work as well as the progressive disclosure approach I previously relied on using \"AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md\" files that pointed to guideline documents via relative paths.\n\nThe slash command functionality also seems broken now. Since slash commands are effectively treated as skills it appears to sometimes confuse the two which makes the slash command workflow I had less reliable.\n\nAnd regarding the idea that it is nerfed. Over the past few days I have noticed Claude Code not performing the way it used to. I am usually very cautious with claims like this and prefer to substantiate them, but the difference has become hard to ignore. At this point I really need to start setting up proper evals so I can verify this.",

Often times I’ve seen where these really were biased towards the authors workflow and you never see the intent of that, so you are trying to find out how to work like they did, but I have pulled several parts and pieces out of them from just skimming the source to drop into my vanilla setup. The one exception for me as a mostly backend guy is the frontend-design skill, I’m sure it’s not building production quality sites in the eyes of a pro in frontend, but to give me a quick look at something interesting I’m working on, I have found it produces a far better aesthetic than I would spend time on and the functionality I need in usually a single shot prompt.",

Found out it somehow had flipped to a different Supabase project and royally screwed me up for a while.  I thought it was safe to be working on multiple projects and the same time, but apparently not.  I usually have 2-3 VScodes going hard and 1-2 Antigravities running plus Claude Desktop building Wordpress projects and this is the first time this has happened.   Also seeing a lot of CC crashes.

I have worktrees for as many things as I can reasonably work on at once (usually 3) for each project, and then I have a \"parking\" branch for each one (dev-1, dev-2, dev-3).  \n\nWhen I want to work on a feature, I go to that parking branch, open a new branch for the feature, do the work, then merge it back to my main branch.  Then just rebase your parking branches onto main, and you can repeat the process and re-use the same worktree.  This saves you having to copy your entire project over and over again creating new worktrees, but still lets you work on more than one thing at once.  \n\nThis takes a little bit of git knowledge upfront but nothing that isn't already useful to learn if you're going to be using claude code a lot.",

We have reports of redditors complaining that their Opus 4.5 quota runs out too quickly but that still tells me nothing. Approximatley how many token's worth of Claude Opus did they consume? Was it being provided to them via webchat at 100% of the cost that they could buy it directly as API tokens? Or was it a 50% discount? Or even an 80% discount? A $20 balance on openrouter would go up in smoke within minutes.",
