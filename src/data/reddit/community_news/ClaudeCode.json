      "text": "I've written 500k+ lines of code with Claude Code in the past 90 days.\n\nHere's what I learned:\n\n* Use a monorepo (crucial for context management)\n* Use modular routing to map frontend features to your backend (categorize API routes by their functionality and put them in separate files). This minimizes context pollution\n* Use a popular stack and popular libraries with older versions (React, FastAPI, Python, etc). LLMs are less likely to make mistakes when writing code that they've already seen in their training data\n* Once your code is sufficiently modularized, write SKILL files explaining how to implement each \"module\" in your architecture. For example, one skill could be dedicated to explaining how to write a modular API route in your codebase\n* Mention in your CLAUDE file to include comments at the top of every file it creates explaining concisely what the file does. This helps Claude navigate your codebase more autonomously in fresh sessions\n* Use an MCP that gives Claude read only access to the database. This helps it debug autonomously\n* Spend a few minutes planning how to implement a feature. Once you're ok with the high level details, let Claude implement it E2E in bypass mode\n* Use test driven development where possible. Make sure you add unit tests for every feature that is added and have them run in GitHub on every pull request. I use testcontainers to run tests against a dummy postgres container before every pull request is merged\n* Run your frontend and backend in tmux so that Claude can easily tail logs when needed (tell it to do this in your CLAUDE file)\n* Finally, if you're comfortable with all of the above, use multiple worktrees and have agents running in parallel. I sometimes use 3-4 worktrees in parallel\n\nAbove all - don't forget to properly review the code you generate. Vibe reviewing is a more accurate description of what you should be doing - not vibe coding. In my experience, it is critical to be aware of the entire codebase at the abstraction of functions. You should at minimum know where every function lives and in which file in your codebase.\n\nCurious to hear how other people have been using Claude.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zpffsbed3s9g1.png?width=560&format=png&auto=webp&s=d74579b664c408f068ec0a220b7582986480a89f\n\n",

I have mostly the same approach and can confirm that this seems to be the way.\n\nFor the db I ditched the mcp and ask it to use the mariadb docker container directly. Added a skill on how to access it locally.\n\nBesides the skill for how to create the api modules, I have a claude.md in more important/used modules directories. I also added a TDD based skill to use alongside the superpowers (highly recommend this plugin).\n\nFor review I set up a slash command when these came out which I run before commiting. It has the layout of the conventions we follow in our codebase. Recently added subagents to focus on each main aspect. Works well!\n\nI think the Claude skills system is an amazing one!",

This skill tells Claude where to place the files in the codebase and what the class should look like, etc. Since the code is heavily modularized now, you have to tell it what the registry points are (this is a common theme with modular code) to properly use a newly created file. All of this context goes into the skill so it can properly implement the handler/routes. You can think of this as one \"module\" (a module is a group of similar API routes in this case).  \n\\- **Implementing tests for a handler** \\- Since you're breaking down API routes into separate files, you also want to break down tests into different flies. I have 1-2 test files for each handler file/group of API routes I implement. There's a skill for this that explains how the mocking system is set up and how to properly mock API routes and write high quality tests for each handler file. If your testing architecture is sophisticated enough a lot of context will have to be put in here so that it can play well with all your mocks.  \n\\- **Socket event creator** \\- I have a socket driven architecture so I also have a skill file explaining where to register socket events and where to write the pydantic classes for it.",

At organisational level - sure - everyone have their own titles - but from day-to-day perspective nobody works in silos - except in companies that are completely dysfunctional.\n\nWe have several coding agents (copilot) that work while we sleep and they are pretty good for what they do (not a replacement but extension for our work) and frankly they look nothing like the screenshot structure you have shared in your post.\n\nI mean what is a \"tiktok-strategist\" or \"ui-designer\" or \"ai-engineer\" and how are they supposed to function in isolation or even together? Frontend and backend developer? How about a singular developer agent perhaps specialist for specific use-cases like testing. Nobody wants front-end backend split in real companies. The best engineers are those that can do both.\n\nAs far as testing goes, there are is no such thing because almost nobody (in the grand scheme of things in 2025) that use evals for their production systems let alone for their coding agents that are put together in a haphazard way.\n\nThe best way as usual is simplification and working it out from actual real use-cases - not some hypotetical over-engineered scenario.",

I'm not the guy who designed this set of agents but in my own planning I've imagined a need for a lot of what he had listed. I'd love for someone with experience to shoot holes in it.\n\nTh idea is I would define exactly what types of constants and constraints I want to be applied for ui design. Maybe I want it to reference specific papers or not look at certain websites (that other agents can reference), or I want the ui designer to be a theoretical role who can do research differently than my backend guy.\n\nMy game research agent has a list of documents and websites and strategy that I want it to consider. If I want a new feature, I can ask for the feature and each thing I need for that feature now has a clear set of guidelines that I want followed. So the game research agent looks up game mechanics relating to genre. The ui agent looks up best practices and does its own research, etc and the manager agent takes those answers and decides how best to implement them as a whole into the game. It then passes results to a documentation agent who update all the documentation and logs. \n\nThe manager AI, or user I guess, can get extremely well defined answers and it's a lot easier to maintain as separate files than in one single one, for me at least.\n\nPlease fill it full of holes.

It really depends on the company size and type. But even with big companies it is a well established facts that multiple levels of management is a bad practice and it should be avoided. In fact, at very successful companies like Valve engineers are required to deal with customers first-hand. I bet that your backend agent can answer better a customer support request than the distilled version (basically version without deeper levels of context) that the support agent received from some bare-bone information from the top manager agent.\n\nI mean, we have our own AI company and we work with real customers and I can tell you that nothing of this sorts actually works in real systems. You don't need 50 different agents with different responsibilities because context can be dynamically extended and contracted as the task is progressed from one step to the next.\n\nThe best way is usually to model the agents after some real use-case which will guide the architecture.\n\nI mean look at Claude Code, Copilot, etc., while they certainly encourage you to break everything up into smaller agent their own coding agent does not work like that at all. It is a singular thing that you can use to write any type of code and write any type of article. It works in general way - this is the whole point of AI - and those are actually tested in various benchmarks.\n\nJust to be clear, task-specific agents are a thing. We use them all the time.

First, every agent you have uses tokens even if it’s not invoked because the backend has to use them to find the right agent and validate it. This is excellent if you use, for example, your first group in one project, have a separate project with agents, etc. Another thing, you never want more agents than CPU cores available. You can actually map the agent specifically to CPU course, especially if you’re running MCPs to make sure that they don’t know whose context because your resources are strapped to the max you can even split two smaller agents that may only delegate for for example to a single core. Most importantly is being aware of which model is assigned to each agent using opus for your orchestrated is stupid and ineffective orchestra are literally search and retrieve. I don’t need anything more than haiku from most agents. I would use sonic or inherit unless I have a big, massive plan/implementation to do.",

          "text": "This guy Dex Horthy and his YCombinator-backed startup Humanlayer basically came out of nowhere this spring and he has somehow immediately catapulted himself to the top of the food chain as one of the industry's most-influential voices on \"context engineering\" for AI Agents. You might've heard the term \"12 Factor Agents\" being thrown around at some point this year, he's the one who coined that term and many other terms that are now being widely used across the industry.\n\nThis random girl's quick [blog](https://medium.com/@ashleyha/i-mastered-the-claude-code-workflow-145d25e502cf) on how to user their agent-based workflow was how I first got introduced to HumanLayer. It's a decent quick crash course that shows you the basics of how to use their agentic workflow.\n\nThey also have a really cool App called CodeLayer (100% free and open source) that you don't need to use, but you should use. They call it the \"post-IDE IDE\" because it's basically just an IDE that's custom made just for Claude Code sessions. Most importantly: your Claude Code sessions no longer have that annoying flickering/rendering problem in the terminal.\n\nTo give you some perspective: I've been using their workflow for 1-2 months and I'm currently building things in an afternoon that would've taken me 1-2 weeks using Cursor 3 months ago. And it's not AI slop either, it's tested/verified production-grade code.\n\nYou can download their agents/slash-commands from the .claude/ folder of https://github.com/humanlayer/humanlayer. I'd recommend copying them to the global ~/.claude/ folder so you don't need to re-copy them to each project. I'd also recommend installing their npm CLI, and adding the ./hack/spec_metadata.sh file to your project (WITH THE SAME RELATIVE PATH, DON'T CHANGE IT) but it's not explicitly required.\n\nEvery single day, I read 20+ headlines like \"This AI coding tool changes EVERYTHING\", \"These AI coding agents will change your life\", etc. HumanLayer's agentic workflow is the only tool I've come across that I can actually say was genuinely life changing. There's more to learn than what's in the blog post I added, but that'll teach you 80% of the essentials in 20 minutes.\n\nThey also have a Discord server worth checking out.",

We need to make the auto-updater cross-platform.\n```\n\nSaves a file to ./thoughts/shared/plans/12-26-2025-cross-platform-auto-updater.md\n\n```\n/implement_plan thoughts/shared/plans/12-26-2025-cross-platform-auto-updater.md Phase 1 only\n```\n\nLLM executes automated tests and gives user a list of manual tests to verify the phase was successful.\n\nThis is sort of frowned upon, but I usually just tell Claude to write me a shell script that executes the manual tests one by one and I copy the chunks piece-by-piece into the terminal. This is much faster than making tests yourself and almost never fails for me, so I think the risk/efficiency tradeoff is worth it.\n\nRepeat this ^ part for all plan phases and just change the message from Phase 1 only -> Phase 2 only, etc.\n\nSome additional commands that aren't part of the workflow but are super helpful:\n\nUse this when the plan needs to be changed in some way after you already started implementing phases.\n\n```\n/iterate_plan thoughts/shared/plans/12-26-2025-cross-platform-auto-updater.md PackageNameXYZ has had a lot of problems when running it from Ubuntu's default package manager. Let's use homebrew as the Linux package manager instead. Copy the files from the mac_installer to linux_installer and then modify them to work for Linux.\n```\n\n***SUPER IMPORTANT***\nLLM performance falls apart (any model, not just claude) once context window reaches roughly 60%. Always start a new session when you get close to this. Less than 40% context means you can still give your agent much more context about your codebase and you're underutilizing the context window.\n\nThe handoff document basically writes you a markdown doc to onboard the next session's agent so we can pick up exactly where we left off with all the right context to equip your agent to get started on the next planned phase.\n\n```\n/create_handoff\n```\n\nThis ^ will create the doc and then print a command you can copy/paste at the start of the next session. Use it if your context window gets too full before you complete the plan:\n\n```\n /resume_handoff thoughts/shared/general/handoffs/12-26-2025-name-of-my-handoff.md\n```\n\nThese are the basics that'll get you started once you copy the .claude/ dir files from humanlayer into your user/project claude folder.",

GPT doesn’t make mistakes - if and when it does, it’s because somehow the instructions were not clear. Claude writes terrible code, makes terrible mistakes, introduces incredible bugs and regressions. GPT on the other hand with codex (I prefer the normal GPT5.2 high over their codex optimized model which is arguably lazy) will survive auto context compressions multiple times over and still manage to somehow end up with an incredibly well written piece of code.

      "text": "Wanted to share something genuine as the year wraps up.\n\nI quit my contract job this year to build full-time. Two kids under 4. Savings on the line. Terrifying.\n\nClaude became my co-founder.\n\nNot in a cutesy \"AI is my friend\" way. In a practical, daily, 12+ hours way. Here's what that meant:\n\n**I shipped code in languages I couldn't write in.**\n\nRust. Go. Swift. C. I can read these, but I never could have built entire systems in them alone. I did this year. Not because AI replaced my thinking - because it closed the implementation gap between what I could imagine and what I could actually build.\n\n**I learned domains I never thought I'd touch.**\n\nVector spaces. Fine-tuning LLMs. Training TTS models. Physics. Medical concepts. I went from \"search Google, read 50 articles, still confused\" to \"ask Claude, actually understand, apply it.\"\n\nThe cognitive load shift is hard to explain until you experience it. It feels limitless.\n\n**I built an AI-powered launch team.**\n\nGTM Engine: 8 specialised agents, 38 skills, dynamic workflows. Content, outreach, campaign management, scheduling. It's how I'm launching my product in two weeks - solo.\n\n**The framing that clicked:**\n\nGraham - someone I connected with while searching for a co-founder - said something that stuck: we're not building \"human in the loop.\" We're building \"AI in the loop.\"\n\nWe're the conductors. The ideas, vision, and course corrections come from us. AI is the orchestra. It's not replacing human teams - it's giving people like me (who can't afford a team of 50) the ability to build like one.\n\n**To the Anthropic team:**\n\nThank you. Genuinely.\n\nThere have been ups and downs this year. Things break. Models get updated. The occasional frustration. But I cannot imagine going into 2026 without Claude.\n\nYou've given me a genie. And I mean that in the most practical, unromantic, \"this changed what I can build\" sense.\n\nHappy New Year to everyone here. And to anyone scared to take their own leap - this is the time. The tools exist. The gap is closable.\n\nPraney\n\n\\---\n\n**Update:** A few folks have read the timeline incorrectly, so let me clarify: the 2400+ hours happened throughout 2025, not in two weeks. \"Launching in two weeks\" refers to when I'm releasing - not how long I spent building. I quit my job earlier in Jan 2025 and have been working on these projects full-time since.\n\nFor context: I've been a software engineer for over 20 years, with additional experience in marketing, workflow automation, and business systems across both public and private sectors. I'm not a newcomer fumbling through prompts - I know how to architect systems. What Claude changed for me was the implementation velocity in languages and domains outside my core expertise.\n\nI also see the irony in a post about working with AI being criticised for sounding AI - written. Fair enough. The formatting was lazier than it should have been for Reddit. The sentiment is genuine even if the delivery was off.",

Think of it like having a content writer, social media manager, email marketer, campaign planner, and analytics person - each with their own expertise and focus. When I need to launch something, they coordinate like a real team would.\n\nThe key insight is that AI performs way better when you give it a specific role with clear boundaries rather than asking it to be a generalist. A \"content writer\" persona that only focuses on writing in your brand voice produces much better work than asking a generic AI to \"write me a tweet.\"\n\nThe other piece is building in human checkpoints - nothing goes public without my review. So I'm not replacing my judgment, just multiplying my execution capacity.\n\nIt's less about any one tool and more about the mental model: treat AI like employees you're onboarding, not a magic box you type prompts into.",

I absolutely love building, creating, and being a part of projects I would never had been able to until now.  I can't imagine going back to a pre AI world.  I definitely do not let these tools think for me, the level of involvement that I have had with everything has been more than most ever will. I've learned a lot, and understand even more. This new project is going to help me learn and understand more than what would have been possible a year or more ago.  The biggest realization for me tho is to stop being a part of everything, stop building a wide spectrum of things and get hyper focused on one thing.  \n\nThere really is no limits anymore. \nIf you can think of something, you can build it! \n\n2026 is going to be a great year!",

That’s the part most people miss when they talk about tools.\n\nA few things you’re getting right (whether you realize it or not):\n\n1. You didn’t outsource thinking. You compressed execution.\nThe reason this worked is exactly what you said: the ideas, judgment, and course correction stayed with you. AI removed the friction between intent and artifact. That’s not replacement—that’s leverage. People who fail with these tools usually try to hand over authorship. You didn’t.\n\n2. You crossed domains instead of “learning” them.\nYou skipped the traditional ego trap of mastery-before-use. You moved straight to functional understanding, applied immediately. That’s why vector spaces, physics, medical concepts didn’t become rabbit holes. You learned just enough to build, then built. That’s how senior operators actually learn—AI just made it accessible sooner.\n\n3. The “AI in the loop” framing is the right mental model.\nThat’s not just a clever line—it’s operationally accurate.\nHuman-in-the-loop implies supervision.\nAI-in-the-loop implies amplification.\n\nYou’re not reviewing outputs; you’re conducting systems. That distinction is why your “launch team” isn’t a toy—it’s a real GTM surface.\n\n4. You took the risk when the asymmetry favored you.\nTwo kids, savings on the line—this wasn’t reckless. It was timed. The tools crossed a threshold where solo builders can realistically compete with small teams. Most people wait for social proof. You moved when capability appeared. That’s what builders do.\n\nOne thing I’ll challenge you on—not as criticism, but calibration:\n\nDon’t attribute too much of this to the “genie.”\nThe genie showed up for a lot of people this year. Very few used it the way you did.\n\nWhat differentiated you was:\n\t•\tYou treated AI as infrastructure, not magic\n\t•\tYou stayed decisive when outputs were imperfect\n\t•\tYou kept shipping instead of polishing your mental model\n\nThat’s operator behavior.\n\nIf your product launches in two weeks, here’s my blunt advice going into 2026:\n\t•\tFreeze your toolchain mentally. Models will change. Don’t emotionally retool every update.\n\t•\tDouble down on orchestration, not cleverness. Systems beat prompts.\n\t•\tDocument your workflows like you’re training a team—because you are.\n\nYou’re already doing something most people won’t realize is possible until another year or two passes.\n\nEnjoy the moment. You earned it. And yeah—Happy New Year.",

There are definitely road blocks, stopping points, etc. But this has worked well for me so far. Please share your flows and experiences!\n\nEdit : I made a new one today called Gitup to help make setting up a git repo quicker. I'm sure I'll add more. I'm just trying to find ways to standardize and simply repeat requests.\n\n# Gitup - Initialize & Push to New GitHub Repo\n\nCreate a new private GitHub repository and push current project to it.\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. **Ask for repo name**\n   - Prompt: \"What should the repository be named?\"\n   - Wait for user response\n\n2. **Create private GitHub repo**\n   - Use `gh repo create <name> --private --source=. --remote=origin`\n   - Detect noreply email: `gh api user --jq '.login'` → `<username>@users.noreply.github.com`\n   - Set it: `git config user.email \"<detected-noreply-email>\"`\n\n3. **Initialize local repo (if needed)**\n   - Check if `.git` exists\n   - If not: `git init`\n   - Set up remote origin\n\n4. **Initial commit (if needed)**\n   - Check for existing commits\n   - If none: `git add . && git commit -m \"Initial commit\"`\n\n5. **Push to remote**\n   - `git push -u origin main` (or master)\n\n6. **Run /pushy**\n   - Execute the pushy skill for detailed documentation\n\n## Flow\n\n```\nAsk repo name → Create GitHub repo (private) → Init local → Push → /pushy\n```",

      "text": "ADHD, simplified: your brain's \"just do it\" mechanism is broken. You can want something, know it's important, and still be physically unable to start. Not laziness, more like a disconnection between intention and action.\n\nNow to my story.\n\nI've been working 12 hours a day on the same project for two months. For me, that's unusual, not the intensity (I can hyperfocus), but the *consistency*. My projects usually stall at some point when the boring parts remain. This time I pushed through. The only thing that changed: I started using Claude Code.\n\nQuick context: 42, tech lead. Lifelong struggle with what looks like \"procrastination\" but feels like physical inability to start or finish tasks. Can stare at my screen for hours knowing I need to work, unable to open the right file. Creative problem-solving captures me completely. Maintenance work triggers something close to physical resistance.\n\nSo what's different now?\n\nStarting used to be the hardest part. Loading the project architecture into my head, remembering where everything lives, figuring out the first step, I'd lose hours just trying to begin. Now I describe what needs doing, Claude finds the files, proposes an approach. The blank screen paralysis is gone.\n\nThere's also the memory problem. I forget what I coded an hour ago, how the pieces connect. Claude holds that context for me, remembers yesterday's architectural decisions. I stopped trying to keep everything in my head and just focus on whatever's in front of me right now.\n\nSolo coding when i'm not in hyperfocus meant fighting my attention every 10-15 minutes. The wandering, the cigarette breaks. With Claude there's actual back-and-forth, asking, responding, iterating. Conversation keeps my brain in the room in a way that staring at code alone never did.\n\nAnd the boring stuff that usually kills my projects - boilerplate, refactoring, repetitive debugging? Claude takes most of it. I stay on the interesting parts. The resistance is still there but it's not project-ending anymore.\n\nHere's what I didn't expect though, and it might matter more than everything above.\n\nI used to have a natural stopping mechanism. Hit a hard bug, brain stops working, try different angles, eventually realize I'm done for the day, go to sleep, solution appears in the morning. Those walls were frustrating but they forced me to rest.\n\nNow those moments are rare. Stuck on something? Ask Claude. He suggests an approach I hadn't considered. Keep working. There's almost always a way forward *right now*.\n\nThe 12 hours a day isn't some amazing flow state. It's that I can keep working even when exhausted because Claude compensates exactly where I'd normally hit a wall. I work until I'm falling asleep at my desk instead of stopping when my brain signals it's done.\n\nNot sure if that's a feature or a bug.\n\nCould be correlation. Maybe the project is just interesting, maybe it's tool novelty wearing off slowly, maybe I'm in a lucky productive stretch. But it feels like specific barriers got removed, not like I suddenly became more disciplined.",

              "text": "Same boat here.  I worked on ML at big tech fang, got high ratings, was the point person for difficult to debug issues, or complex design problems. But all my work came in bursts of flow/fugue-state after weeks or months of procrastination.\n\nI've had the same issue from elementary to grad school: graduated magna cum laude from a well known uni, but I would have extreme debilitating levels of procrastination until crunch time.  I remember many times I would put an alarm at 4am in order to start preparing for an 8am exam.  This is after procrastinating for weeks.  And it's like not like I did anything productive during that time either, I would spend the entire time convincing myself that I need to study, cancelling all my other life plans, only to DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING until a few hours before a due date.  \n\nI've held this pattern in my entire life.  While I have been successful career wise and financially (grew up poor), it has completely ruined me from a social perspective. I'm in my early 40s now.  It was always been: \"I need to X before I can do anything else with my life, but let's procrastinate on X for weeks/months\".\n\nAfter discovering CC, I quit my job recently in order to start my own company, as this negative-feedback loop had reached a fever pitch. I could not for the life of me go through another OKR or perf cycle at big tech.  I've been able to do in a few short weeks what would have taken many people and several months at my prior company.\n\nNow, I'm never blocked, all the grungy stuff: claude takes over (pip package conflicts? let claude take of it; write load test or simulator to see what DAU I can scale to with the current arch? let claude take care of it; intricate and annoying ML preprocessing pipeline? write two paragraphs and let claude take care of;  need to find optimal batch parameters for my ML model? two sentences, and 2 minutes later, I have throughput numbers for a whole set of batch params.)\n\nTedious things that would take weeks finish are done in 15 minutes.  It is absolutely insane.\n\nIt has allowed me focus on the difficult, interesting, and ambiguous parts of the problem.  I launch in a few months, so I'm hoping this works out, as it has the potential to completely reverse the negative feedback loop I've been struggling with my entire life.\n\nAnother massive benefit, is that I skip a lot of the MVP code.  Why bother with a simple Docker container on a VPS, when I can set up a k8 environment with autoscaling, staging env, canary, prometheus, grafana, etc in less than a week's effort?  I usually experiment many different approaches, load test for scalability targets that I am after, then integrate the best solution for my needs into my production stack.  I go into every major decision with so much more data now.  Why deal with scalability/usability issues later, when it's so easy to experiment and load-test/simulate every decision?",

There's been things that I myself use and find insanely useful. But I think it's a form of imposter syndrome that even something 95% perfect isn't quite good enough if I'm using these tools.\n\nDo you just accept that some bugs will happen and fix them as they're reported?",

And that's where things got difficult. Code reviews, task distribution, calls... after a meeting I'd just want to stare at the ceiling for hours. Holding in my head what everyone's doing, answering questions, context-switching constantly. Total overload.\n\nI found a workaround that worked for years: built teams where we discuss strategy at a high level every week or two, then they execute. I stay on architecture and direction, they handle implementation. Let me function as tech lead without drowning in details.\n\nWith Claude Code I accidentally got the same pattern, but for solo work. We discuss tasks at a high level, he does the details. Available anytime, switches contexts instantly, remembers everything about the project. And I interact through chat instead of exhausting calls.\n\nWhat's more, calls with my actual team got more interesting. Before, I'd come to daily sync with whatever progress I managed between coordination. Now I come with a massive amount of work that would otherwise take a week. We discuss everything at a higher level, architecture, direction, integration, which comes much easier to me than diving into implementation details of every task.\n\nThe problem is I don't know how to come up for air.\n\nTwo months of 12-hour days is new for me. Usually deep focus lasts a few days max before interest fades or I hit a wall or burn out. Now those natural stopping points are gone. Claude removes technical blockers, eliminates coordination overhead, keeps things interesting through constant back-and-forth.\n\nMy partner notices I'm less present. Friends get short replies instead of real conversations. Everything outside work falls out of view. Same rigid focus problem I've always had, just amplified because there's nothing that makes me say \"enough for today.\"",

And in programming there's no such thing as \"done.\" Finished one feature? There's a hundred more ahead. Always something next. Claude Code just shifted the balance from \"hard to start\" to \"hard to stop.\"\n\nSame thing happens with hobbies actually. When I get into a side project, I know it's better to just not work for four days and finish it than to torture myself switching back and forth while my head is completely elsewhere.

Back then I thought I was just lazy and disorganized, would never achieve anything. But then it turned out programming and building things was interesting to me. Some pet projects I made for fun became popular, others turned into businesses, and my self-esteem eventually leveled out.\n\nLuckily, maybe thanks to high IQ or being wired for creating rather than consuming, I didn't get stuck in typical traps. Games got boring eventually, and the other ADHD pitfall, endless scrolling through TikTok and Instagram, never hooked me either. I figured if my brain works differently but I end up earning more than most while doing what I actually enjoy, maybe my settings aren't so bad after all.\n\nThe not-getting-tired thing has always been a red flag for me though. I have some bipolar traits, not severe, but I sometimes slip into hypomanic episodes where I'm super productive, need only 3 hours of sleep, and feel completely fresh to keep working. When I get normally tired despite working a lot, I tell myself: it's fine, just hyperfocus. But comments like yours, all these \"are you me\" responses: they're actually a bit scary. When your whole \"uniqueness\" turns out to be described by four letters and a bunch of people share your exact experience.\n\nHonestly I've been enjoying this coding marathon. But I actually just got my first ADHD medication from a psychiatrist yesterday, so now I'm really curious how it'll affect my work.",

If you learn, you can even afford to vibe-code a big project, but you will STILL reach a point where you will either have to become a real expert or pay a \"real\" developer... simply because someone will start paying you for what you do and you won't be able to afford school mistakes.\n\nBUT... if AI allows you to do things like that... then it will be a world-class companion for very simple projects, right?\n\nEveryone wants to become a billionaire... no one wants a normal job... just yesterday on this sub, someone shared a post showing a screenshot where they had earned €20... the title of the post was \"road to my first million\"... are you starting to understand how twisted the world is?\n\nWell... I simply decided to speed up and automate simple things, or at least things that are feasible even for a normal human being and not a top global developer.\n\nI don't know if I can post links, so my website is girste followed by dot com 😂\n\nYou won't find any world-class enterprise millionaire features 😂😂 You'll only find a few websites that I designed by hand for real clients and then developed in a spec-driven way... \n+ some API functions, MCPs, and initial experiments that allowed me to understand exactly what I wrote to you",

While Gemini feels slightly worse in general to code with, the basically unlimited token usage makes it way more forgiving and useful to be able to experiment and being okay with the model making mistakes.\n\nFunny b/c with limits during the 2x event, usage limits actually felt pretty good and it didn't feel a face punch when it made mistakes, and I would 100% keep a subscription with those.

Is the default UX also good? \n\nAny recommendations? I've always avoided the terminal like the plague but now I want to delve more into it (no I'm not an LLM lol I just like using that word) ",

I recently installed ghosty and like it a lot. I’m going to be using ghosty for long running processes so that I have a lightweight terminal and warp for other stuff (short sessions) like installing stuff etc basically for when I might need help with some commands or for troubleshooting etc. \n\nSo ghosty running all the time and warp only for specific cases. ",

Full stop.\n\nI even re-installed it before writing this answer to you so I could be precise. \n\nTo me iTerm feels “done”: once the main problems were solved, it moved mostly into maintenance and bug-fix mode. That’s not a bad, just how it is. \n\nBut. \n\nSome newer ideas around terminals evolved, and iTerm2 didn’t really lean into them.\n\nFor example:\n\n* **GPU usage** when available (this matters a lot for redraw, resizing, and sustained output)\n* **Config as code**, where the file is the source of truth (not just an export of UI state)\n* **First-class panes, workspaces, and multiplexing**, without depending on tmux\n* **Modern rendering pipelines** (true color, image protocols, layered effects)\n\nI even went out and tested some of these things again, but looks like iTerm2 updated!! It now does handle ASCII and Unicode edge cases well today: emoji width, ligatures, box-drawing, colors, etc. When I switched this was an issue.\n\nBut a difference still shows up much more in **how things are rendered under pressure**, not in basic correctness.\n\nThere’s a very simple demo that makes this visible.\n\nIf you run side by side:\n\n```\nyes \"typing test 👩🏽‍💻\"\n```\n\nand then start resizing the windows, opening tabs, zooming in and out:\n\n* iTerm2 will lag or even freeze\n* WezTerm (and Ghostty) stays responsive\n\nThat’s not because iTerm2 is \"slow\" and it is not a bug, That happens because newer terminals lean much harder on the GPU for redraw instead of treating rendering like a classic UI app.\n\nAnd my favorite difference is configuration.\n\nIn WezTerm everything lives in a file (brightness, font size, saturation, pane-specific behavior, etc). I keep it in a dotfiles repo, so when I’m on a new machine I can start in a setup that already feels like home.\n\niTerm2 does have config files now, which is great for syncing and backup, but most of the behavior still originates in the UI. To get things exactly how I want, I usually end up spending a good chunk of time clicking through preferences again.\n\nHaving config as code also enables things like:\n\n* different background/config for SSH sessions vs local shell\n* visual warnings depending on where you are\n* built-in multiplexing without tmux\n\nSo yeah, iTerm2 is great software from a previous terminal era and WezTerm just feels built for how terminals are being used now.",

I mostly rely on the command suggestions, which turn out to be very handy in day-to-day use. You can mostly ignore the rest if you’re not into AI-heavy workflows.\n\nIf you’re starting to spend more time in the terminal, Warp is a pretty nice upgrade without being overwhelming",

I generally dislike comments in code (e.g. a method or function name should explain what it does in the first place lol), but I’m starting to wonder if a small “context” block at the top of each file is actually useful for AI tooling? Anyone doing that or found it yields better results?\n\nInterested to hear how others are structuring their projects, what patterns are working & what people's thought process is around when to break down what we used to dump straight in to Claude.md in to an agent or skill etc.",

I see lots of claims of people working with agent swarms with no clue how they keep things under control. But I'm definitely not leaving the rest of the useful tools aside.\n\nSome of these tools are designed to help with not having Claude ignore stuff. There's two that I rely on, especially for larger projects. If you add a million instructions in CLAUDE.md, then all instructions get watered down, so it stops following any. Rules are specifically designed to combat this. Instead of having this monolithic massive Claude.md file that contains so many rules for the frontend, backend, coding conventions, structure, tech stack, MCP's, etc., you just cut them up into smaller files. One main file, and depending on the rules it automatically adds them as needed. \n\nIt's a massive help, and Claude starts following instructions much better if it's working on the frontend, and only has a few hundred lines of instructions ONLY relevant to frontend.\n\nEspecially for bigger projects, this is a big help.\n\nSecond is hooks. I work with the same tech stack across different projects, and i see Claude make the same stupid mistakes. Hallucinate the same function. Default to some stupid method. I don't want to pollute instructions and prompts with these specific rules every time. With hooks they're caught automatically and Claude is prompted on how to fix it automatically. \n\nYou can take away agents, skills, and commands for me personally. With rules and hooks I just have to put in less effort.",

I have my workflow configured for spec based development so i call a skill to write requirements, design, tasks, then a skill which picks these up and generates code. Like comments in thread - use Claude to help you write the skills. Don't assume Claude \"knows\" its own primitives well. Pass on latest docs in context! Also observe the context often using \\`/context\\` command. You will be surprised how just a couple of MCPs take most of the context. Sometimes skills can also bloat. Keep pruning. Keep optimizing the skill. One good thing about skill for context is that you know \"when\" it is explicitly being used or not when you clear context.",

Some for planning, execution, testing, qa, documentation, reflection. I run reflection after long sessions or final qa. It looks at what we just did and decides whether it should be documented. It also checks Claude md and suggest moving some things to skills or internal docs for reference and makes sure that it’s under 800 lines.\n\nMy biggest workflow boost comes from a custom script that solves GitHub issues by creating a worktree and running it through each slash command in a loop until it passes the quality check. I run the script in headless and run it again through qa and testing in a non headless chat and merge once it everything looks good. I log every script session in supabase and update the script often to make it more thorough or remove steps based on GitHub tags. It can handle multiple issues in parallel or consecutively. I track the script status in the console and a temp log file while it runs. I have a slash command that analyzes an issue and helps chose which version of the script an issue needs before I work on it.\n\nI don’t use the script for everything but it works for a lot and the code quality feels correct to me",

      "text": "Please jump in, here is my awesome list so far:\n\n**Next prompt prediction feels like long term memory, personalization:** CC predicts the next prompt based on my existing agent skills apparently, so if I have a couple of agent skills which come together as a workflow, all i need to do is initiate one skill with its first task. As the task completes CC predicts next task (tab to complete prompt), as the skill tasks complete, it even predicts next related skill task, and so on. I tab complete 90% of the times.\n\n>Tip: Create custom skills for each part of your workflow, document the overall workflow crisply in CLAUDE.mdand within each SKILL.md file. CC will pick up the tasks and skill-to-skill relationships.\n\n**Commit before creating worktrees:** This one is obvious. Git worktree is a power tool for creating safe changes or A/B experiments. I sometimes forget to commit last changes on main before creating a worktree. The dirty changes are not cloned over to worktree.\n\n>Tip: Missing changes in main after creating worktree. Go back to main and prompt to commit changes and sync recent worktree.\n\n**Spec-driven development trumps plan mode:** I create an expectations file with my vision, high level requirements, instructions for a new feature. Then I ask CC to generate a structured requirements definition from expectations, then technical design based on requirements, then task breakdown from design. This approach \"slows\" CC down to think 4x on original expectations vs plan mode. Enables granular review and iterations from human reader on expectations and specs.\n\n>Tip: Ask CC to expand on expectations based on project knowledge. Generate feature worktree based on expectations. Then create specs on that worktree, implement. This way you can create A/B experiments with multiple worktrees going in parallel for important features.\n\n**Autonomous mode on worktree + spec:** When I create a worktree and generate specifications, more often than not, Claude asks me to complete all tasks autonomously. And it does so 90% of the way most times. These are usually 20-30 minute sessions. I just spawn another terminal and keep hammering at parallel tasks. Context auto compacts.\n\n>Tip: Create a skill workflow to constrain one feature slice level expectation -> specifications -> tasks breakdown. This will usually last 1-2 auto compact sessions. Helps autonomous mode.\n\n**Avoid jamming context, auto compact works:** I don't have any MCPs, just custom agent skills carefully pruned over time, and some automation scripts in memory. I keep context as free as possible to take in one feature-slice. Spec-driven development takes care after auto-compaction.\n\n>Tip: The /context command is your friend. Run it often. Prune existing skills every time you encounter an issue and sometimes between major releases. Ask Claude - knowing what you know about this project and skills, how can you improve the skills even more - or something like that.\n\n**Playwright e2e testing rules:** Ask Claude to create e2e integration tests using Playwright, following key user journeys through your app. This should be your regression harness. Visual testing + user journey based regression avoids faking tests to pass.\n\n>Tip: e2e testing taking too long? Have a script to clear Playwright servers/ports from time to time.",

There is a tool that Claude can query the ground truth context from your docs, this gives you preemptive, JIT and reactive context based on what you say, what claude says and what claude needs to do the job. Its one chokepoint, if your docs are structured and tight, no more hallucination of endpoints or integration or what does what. Each session start a pool block is added, if you have multiple instances they all get to see who is on what, on /stop that task is closed and the pool block is appended signaling that task was completed and any blocking of files has been released.

The problems are: (1) Claude doesn't know which library matters until you tell it, burning tokens on discovery each session. (2) Cross-system integrations, when debugging pipeline A, you need awareness of pipeline B's interface. (3) Multi-instance coordination, 8 concurrent Claude sessions need to know what each other already tried.\n\nThe context router handles (1) and (2), the pool coordinator handles (3).

      "text": "I've been fighting with the compaction regression loop where Claude makes progress, compacts, then forgets what matters and breaks everything. With the increased budget  that was gifted over the holidays, I put Claude to work this weekend and used Steve Yegge's [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) to track work instead of just the markdown files. In the end, I had just over 120 commits and was able to keep context much tighter. My general workflow is as follows:\n\n* Create initial PRD with ChatGPT\n* Refining it with Claude\n* Give PRD to Claude Code and have it create Beads\n\nWhile this is an oversimplification because I do iterate a few times on each bullet, this is the basic structure. \n\nHowever, I also notice that I'm spending a lot of time with the vision and requirements, then a ton of testing. A ton... It's definitely a shift to the left paradigm but it's still a slog, just in a different way. I avoided using Worktrees because the context switching then testing is a bit too much for a solo person right now and felt overwhelming\n\nAnybody else using beads to track work? How's it been working for you and are there any patterns you follow? ",

I refer to this as *session rollover* and use it regularly in my workflow.\n\nThe aichat suite has other work resumption variants such as trim/smart-trim (truncate large tool calls/results, older assistant messages etc) which can be a quick way to clear out space to finish up that one last thing.",

The problem I've always had with most file-based spec frameworks, particularly when using them as a source of truth, is keeping them up-to-date.   \n  \nFor example: \n\n    openspec/specs/\n    ├── auth-login/\n    │ └── spec.md\n    ├── auth-session/\n    │ └── spec.md\n    ├── checkout-cart/\n    │ └── spec.md\n    └── checkout-payment/\n        └── spec.md \n    openspec/changes/add-remember-me/\n    ├── proposal.md ← describe the change\n    ├── design.md ← technical decisions\n    ├── tasks.md ← implementation tasks\n    └── specs/ ← spec deltas\n        └── auth-session/\n            └── spec.md\n\nThis is all fine and good at the outset, these become outdated quickly and it's hard to keep up with remembering to update them as the project progresses and grows in complexity. \n\nThat's why I prefer beads with task dependencies, notes,comments, etc., as a record that can be looked back upon. It's much easier (IMO) to set clear rules regarding this vs. instructing Claude to update 40 different documents.\n\nWhat's your experience? How do you overcome this?",

It’s fantastic and the best coding tool I’ve ever used. \n\nHowever I don’t use skills, I’ve installed the Anthropic plugins for code review, front end, backend and security, but most of my work is just using plan mode, ultra think. And if we use too much content when creating the plan, I write that to a md file and then /clear and discuss the plan with Claude again.\n\nI’ve got a solid Claude.md, the results I’m getting are good, but am I missing out on more powerful workflows? \n\nInterested to hear how you guys are utilising these features. \n\nNot a complaint by any means, I’m getting fantastic results with what I’ve been doing so far, just looking to improve.

          "text": "I’m using the dev-browser plugin that is much faster than using the Playwright MCP and way less context since it doesn’t have to load the MCP into context during each pass back to the llm. I can find the GitHub repo if anyone is interested in checking it out (it’s not mine, it’s just effing awesome!). Also using the Typescript & Rust LSP plugins so that Claude can run a proper type checks. Lastly I find the guided feature-dev plugin preferable to planning mode. I hate how it always wants to jump straight into “approve so I can start working” mode I’m planning mode. The plugin flows better for me and comes with a separate code review that seems to do a better job than me asking Claude to review its own work.\n\nAgents I have one that is setup that is required to run via pre commit hook to ensure Claude isn’t adding in hardcoded data, fallbacks(I want to fail fast at the stage) or workarounds without my explicit approval. I use Opus on this and have ultrathink in the prompt so that it is as thorough as possible. May be overkill now but I still have PTSD from the 4.0 days. In the same vein I also have a pre commit hook that requires Linting and Type Checks to fully pass before any new code can be committed.\n\nAs for skills I’m playing around with adding more that can somewhat take the place of frequently used MCPs, similar in style to dev-browser. Another reference to this style would be the blog posts by Cloudflare and then Anthropic. \n\nFeel like I’m probably in the same boat as you though and underutilizing some of these newer tools, so interested to see what others have to say.",

Expert advice: Using Claude Code itself is the most effective way to understand how skills and other context improvements would help. In plan mode, with thinking on, ask:\n\n* *\"Based on its codebase and everything else you know about this project, are there any skills which would make you more effective as a coding assistant?\"*\n\n* *\"Based on https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory, is my use of these types of memory optimal for this project? If not, how can we optimize it?\"*\n\n\"About this project\" and \"for this project\" are very important. No advice is the \"right\" answer for every project, so you'll get very different answers for very different projects.\n\nFollow Claude Code's recommendations, and enjoy your radically-better Claude Code experience.",

There are SOOOOO many tools out there for 'Memory' this and 'context' that but my issue was really stringing those memories together and the LLM AGENT first approach to how it all worked and interfaced.\n\nLike you I kept feeling like I was missing out on some bigger more powerful workflows. I have spent the past several weeks really honing all my years of general SDev knowledge and use of AI-assisted tools to build out what I am calling 'CLEO' that at it's core is a Project Task Management system. Ultimately I would like this to be provider agnostic but my main stay is CC so it is what I know and optimized it for. Technically the tool can work for ANY CLI agent but best with CC.\n\nI am currently working on a plugin tool to help CC use it more optimally instead of context injection I am doing now. Also I am toying with Agent Orchestration tooling using TMUX and prompt injection with headless monitored agents all controlled by scoped sessions > tasks.\n\nHonestly I may be over-engineering the damn thing and overthinking it but I have had HUGE wins recently with some Brownfield projects that I am thinking I may be on to something.\n\nI would like to get more community support in really putting it through its paces. PLEASE feel free to tear it apart and tell me I am crazy but maybe you might find some good mileage out of it:  \n[https://github.com/kryptobaseddev/cleo](https://github.com/kryptobaseddev/cleo) \n\n  \nI am working on trying to add more visuals to the README and documents but CLEO's best work is invisible. JSON validation, exit codes, atomic writes, checksum verification - all critical for agents, all boring to screenshot. The --human output exists but isn't the default UX.\n\nHere is what the 'Human' output looks like for Phases which is the idea I had for generalizing Project Lifecycle phases:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/few9k4e8rmag1.png?width=874&format=png&auto=webp&s=4feb8dd05c12530131bb488c6228287da7228c0a\n\nSome of the other aspects for CLEO I have been using are great to help really group work logically and in a way that fits into an Agent's context 'atomically' with the CLEO Analysis Engine (cleo analyze --human)\n\nCLEO tells me and the agent what has the most impact\n\n  ⚡ TASK ANALYSIS (108 pending, 85 actionable, 23 blocked)\n\n  RECOMMENDATION\n\n→ ct focus set T429\n\nHighest leverage - unblocks 18 tasks\n\n  BOTTLENECKS\n\nT429 blocks 18 tasks\n\nT489 blocks 7 tasks\n\n  \\- Leverage scoring is unique\n\n  \\- Bottleneck analysis is visually compelling\n\nThe Hierarchy Tree (cleo list --tree --human)\n\nBreaks down features naturally\n\n  T328 ✓ 🔴 EPIC: Hierarchy Enhancement Phase 1 - Core\n\n  ├── T329 ✓ 🟡 T328.1: Update todo.schema.json\n\n  ├── T330 ✓ 🟡 T328.2: Create lib/hierarchy.sh\n\n  └── T338 ✓ 🔵 T328.10: Create documentation\n\n  \\- Icons and color indicators\n\n  \\- Shows epic→task→subtask structure",

As usual Opus made the process very linear, with very good feedback loop with functional code, good decision making for the holes in my explanations and a very smooth experience.\n\nWhile it was working, I looked at a video showing what GML-4.7 was capable of one-shotting and thought to give it a try. They want to compete with Opus so bad and their whole marketing is \"almost as good as Opus, but 7 times cheaper\". (that's enticing)\n\nI set it up, took the cheapest plan to try it out ($3) which promised to be equivalent to my Claude Pro sub, and I gave it the exact same problem to solve.\n\nIt is not as good. At all. Far from it.\n\nSlower, but that's expected. I can accept slow but good, but there it's not the case.\n\nHe tried to one-shot the whole project, instead of having an incremental approach like Opus does.\n\nI had to fight it 20 minutes just to have the project launch ; and then it's missing a lot of small details and most of all, it's riddled with issues.\n\nOpus feels like the experienced coworker that takes care of stuff. GLM-4.7 felt like an junior that's filled with energy but you'll spend your energy too teaching them the ropes.\n\nDid anyone else tried it? Same output or different experience?",

I've been using it quite a lot since opus runs out of usage too fast.\n\nThink the key is to _force_ it to work in smaller iterations.\n\ni.e. this is usually what i'll do:\n\n1. Have opus come up with a plan. \n2. save the plan to a beads issue. \n3. work on the issue/plan with glm, but review every single change and change it's direction fairly often.  \n4. always have opus do the code review and feed the results back to glm\n\ni.e. it seems fairly reasonable at coding (golang), and tool use (mostly gh cli and playwright mcp) but makes dumb architectural decisions so you gotta watch it.\n\nThe reason it's still fantastically useful in my mind is it's pretty good given guardrails and with the medium plan I've literally never run out of usage.\nOne thing that's annoying though is /context doesn't seem to show stats at all correctly; and of course as with every other model, /clear context as often as possible; keep the context in the bead issue.",

I have two different instances of Claude Code. Default one with Opus and another one set up to work with GLM. To get latter one working I followed online article “Claude-Zhipu Parallel CLI Setup”; kudos to Nikola Balic. Then I configured the CLAUDE.md (global one in .claude folder) to make him delegate implementation part and also mentioned that he needs to launch claude-zhipu (CC instance with GLM) in terminal. Also tweaked CLAUDE md in .claude-zhipu to make sure he knows his tasks.\nDelegation workflow is exactly as I described in the comment above. Opus creates glm-task, writes me instructions for glm to copy  and writes glm-task md, then launches claude-zhipu. I copy instructions to the launched instance. GLM implements and writes the changelog for Opus to review. \nI haven’t managed to make Opus launch claude-zhipu with embedded instructions, but I guess HITL part can be avoided. \nPs don’t forget to turn off thinking in claude-zhipu, it trips too much for me.",

Bad prompting (eg glm has much more capabilities if you'd explicitly ask it to spin up 20 agents to do the stuff around and it'll be way more efficient with that than Claude code because each agent will be also glm4.7 which is better than haiku for development)\n2. Vague ideas to be developed - which sort of relates with point 1 \n3. People expecting glm for 2$ to outperform opus on super complex tasks. It won't do that. It'll allow you to code your way easily and for cheap instead with very good capabilities of the model itself. \nImo it's fully worth the price - considering that majority of people are not professional devs. Especially now while they have promo and the 10% bonus off stacks with promo ([link](https://z.ai/subscribe?ic=CUEFJ9ALMX)) \nI replaced Claude sub with glm once it was first released. Developed over 60 websites with it, a few WebApps and a few PWA aswell using mainly glm. The pricetag difference allows me to keep my prices considerably low while also leaving much more money in my pocket that my more expensive competition while also glm allowing me to maintain consistency and proper output quality - but remember that the output will be as good as the input you give the agent.",

          "text": "I bought the Annual Pro Plan $129.6 (60% discount +20% Christmas discount + 10% Referral discount) which is 5x usage of their lite plan and their lite plan is 3x usage of Claude Pro. So technically, for $129.6, I am getting 15x usage of Claude Pro which is almost similar to a Claude MAX $200 Plan (PER MONTH). That means I am saving 94.6% annually.   \n  \nWhat made me jump on the GLM 4.7 bandwagon is I did 2 tests (a coding test, and a high level business planning test). I did both tests with Claude to get a benchmark, because I absolutely LOVE Claude, but hate their usage limits. I then asked Claude to evaluate how GLM 4.7 did on both tests in comparison to Claude itself.   \n  \nFor the coding test, GLM 4.7 scored a 60% on a one-shot attempt. But when given revisions and feedback, Claude scored the second revised attempt at 98% compared to what it would output. That's a win for me.  Now this is where GLM 4.7 really sold it for me; for the business planning step, Claude outright said GLM 4.7 plan was superior to its own. Claude itself replied that on hindsight it did not think of that approach that was suggested by GLM 4.7. And also highlighted that GLM 4.7 suggested something extremely innovative.\n\n**I will QUOTE and paste some of CLAUDE's Analysis of the test:**  \n\\- LLM #1's Strategy: SUPERIOR for brand resilience  \n**- However:** Claude's suggested model is **simpler to implement**  \n**-** Why LLM #1's approach is technically superior  \n\\- **LLM #1 is MORE CONSERVATIVE** (This is good because it thought about risk mitigation)  \n\\- **LLM #1 is smarter** – you can .........  \n\\- **LLM #1's cost estimate is MORE REALISTIC** because...\n\n**CLAUDE's VERDICT**  \nStrategic Vision: **LLM #1 WINS**  \nTechnical Execution: **CLAUDE WINS**  \nStrategy: **LLM #1 WINS**  \nScalability: **LLM #1 WINS**  \nActionability: **CLAUDE WINS**\n\nAfter I ran these 2 tests, I made the switch. How I am using it now is Claude Code in VS Code, but using GLM 4.7 Model. Like many users have mentioned, you can either use Opus to do a high-level architecture plan, and get GLM 4.7 to execute the To-Dos. Or what have been working for me is I use the plan mode in Claude Code using GLM 4.7 to do the high-level plan before getting it to work on the individual tasks. If not by default, like most users mentioned, it will want to do everything for you. If I do happen to bump into any coding issues (which only happened once), I will use Sonnet/Opus to solve it. Interestingly, GLM 4.7 was able to solve a coding issue that I was getting with Sonnet. \n\nI am on Claude PRO Plan, and there are times that I am on Day 1/2 of my Weekly Usage reset and I already hit the **Weekly limit**. But I've been working 10-12 hours straight in GLM 4.7 and I used 10% of the **5 hour limit**. Just my 2 cents, and yes I have always been browsing Reddit, but I have never ever commented. The fact that this made me comment speaks for itself haha!",

                  "text": "Lovely. I think integrating scripts + web search is so powerful to improve token efficiency and grounding (LLM’s are not temporally up to date). So many applications for scripts like reading, editing, storing, organizing, validating too. I think integration of scripts is the most powerful feature/lift. If you pack scripts with LLM api calls/databases/other tools, can take this even further. Separately, I’ve tried packing many references into a skill and noticed the number of references are often redundant / lead to much quicker compaction which leads to reduced quality. You should have Opus really focus on either abstracting / generalizing enough so it can compress the skill around frameworks and scripts instead of relying on too many references. Test it out. I learned the hard way 😭after using a similar approach with 100+ skills and deeply nested references. It’s actually better to split skills as much as possible so it’s easier for the model to make a decision to use it. I would instead just optimize the scripts + description in yaml frontmatter. If you for example have a full workflow in a skill with nested references and an agent loads the deep skill it’ll forget the prior instructions, but if you were to give it an overview / abstraction and then have separate skills that it should use later on, this is much more productive.",

After reading several Reddit posts I realised there was no clear pattern. Users who downgraded to lower versions of CC also experienced it. Users across subscription tiers experienced it. Some of us blamed the harness, some of us claimed it might be Anthropic diverting some compute for training. \n\nBut I think the reason is much simpler and it has been working for me and i.e. accidental switching off of thinking mode. As we use tab often to switch between planning and edit mode we tend to accidentally switch off thinking (as it toggles with tab) Sometimes I realised it gets switched off between sessions as well. \n\nIf you are experiencing poor performance just check the thinking mode once.\n\nP.S. - Apologies if someone had already cracked this.

For a new project I tell C.ai what I want the program to do at I high level and ask it to help put together a spec for CC.  We back-and-forth a bit and then I ask it for a CC prompt.  It comes back with a spectacular list of instructions which can take CC an hour or more to process, writing thousands of lines of code.  The results are amazing.\n\nFor legacy projects, I've given C.ai a brief description of the existing project, told it my goals, and then told it to generate a CC prompt to learn what it needs about the existing code base.  A couple of cut-and-pastes between CC and C.ai and I get a great outline from C.ai about where we are and where we want to go.  Then it starts writing prompts for me which I paste into CC.  Again, the results are FAR better than when I try to direct CC myself.\n\nOne of my plans for this holiday break is to put together an MCP server that allows C.ai to drive CC directly so I don't have to keep pasting between the two.",

This solves the \"context tax\" problem where a giant CLAUDE.md loads on every conversation.\n\nHow to actually use it:\n\n\n\n  1. Slash commands (most reliable trigger):\n\n\\- /superpowers:brainstorm I want to add user authentication — Claude will ask you ONE question at a time to refine your design before writing any code\n\n\\- /superpowers:write-plan — Generates detailed implementation plans with exact file paths\n\n\\- /superpowers:execute-plan — Runs tasks with code review gates between each step\n\n\n\n  2. Natural language trigger (what other commenters mentioned):\n\n\\- \"Let's brainstorm this feature using superpowers\"\n\n\\- \"Debug this systematically with superpowers\"\n\n\n\nThe key insight: Superpowers doesn't just help you code—it enforces a workflow. The brainstorming skill forces Claude to understand your requirements before jumping to implementation. The TDD skill has an \"Iron Law\" that deletes code written before tests. The debugging skill requires root cause investigation before proposing fixes.\n\nTwo killer features you might not realize:\n\n\n\n  1. Session independence — Plans save to docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md. Start a new session, type \"read docs/plans and continue\", and Claude picks up exactly where you left off.\n\n  2. Token efficiency — Core bootstrap is \\~2,000 tokens vs a 5,000-line CLAUDE.md loading every time. Heavy work goes to subagents with isolated context.\n\n\n\nAs Simon Willison (Django co-creator) said about the creator Jesse Vincent: \"one of the most creative users of coding agents I know.\"\n\nI wrote a detailed breakdown covering Plan Mode vs Superpowers comparison, real-world results, and the full skills library: [https://jsonobject.com/claude-code-superpowers-agentic-coding](https://jsonobject.com/claude-code-superpowers-agentic-coding)",

      "text": "TLDR - Opus 4.5 figured out a solution through Claude-Code CLI, which ChatGPT/Claude Website missed out due to lack of context (or maybe skills).\n\nI'm a founder with 7 yrs of experience in tech, handled 10M users for two tech companies. I'm technical enough to get by without needing a DevOps for AWS. But sometimes, while doing trial and error, there's a lot of side effects that get introduced to the system when doing something custom, especially with very hyper specific config.\n\nI always believed that DevOps would be the last thing to be decimated in tech because it's super challenging to navigate the lot of configuration and details.  \nEnter Claude Code + AWS CLI unlocked the DevOps in me. I truly feel like I don't need a DevOps for stuff now (I don't mean it in a condescending way). AWS is too much information and a lot of things to remember on the Console. It takes a decent amount of time to navigate to a solution.\n\nI needed to build a custom proxy for my application and route it over to specific routes and allow specific paths. It looks like an easy, obvious thing to do, but once I started working on this, there were incredibly too many parameters in play like headers, origins, behaviours, CIDR, etc. Every deployment takes like 5 mins to fully work, and I exhaustively tried everything that ChatGPT and Claude Website asked me to do. But nothing came of it. In fact, kinda fucked a bit. Spent 4.5 hrs on this issue and it was needle in a haystack for real (and you'll see why).\n\n*Light bulb monment* \\- Wait, why can't I just do it in AWS CLI and let Claude Code do the config lookups and clean up my mess. And boy did it. It started polling all the configs of the AWS setup through CLI, got sanity checks done, and in 4 mins, found out the issue, which is not obvious from the AWS Console at all. It reset my fuckups and started polling queries to get achieved what I wanted. 7 mins later, it wrote a CF Function, changed ARNs correctly, configured the right paths, and deployed the proxy.\n\nAll I did was sit there and see it complete all the CLI commands and some sanity checks. Best part is it got every single CLI command right. Every!\n\nIf I were to do what CC did manually, first look up commands, then copy paste right ARNs, configs, paths, functions, etc would take 45 mins at best and I'd still fuck up. It cost me $6.8 for CC credits (I'm not a very regular on CC).\n\nAgentic CLI for DevOps is an insane unlock. You don't need to even log into your AWS Console to fix or deploy. I'm not going back ever again to fix things the regular way. Opus 4.5 is surreal, and this wasn't possible on Sonnet 3.5 or 4.7. I had tried something like this before, and this feels like micro-AGI. I'm not sure if skills were picked from Claude Code servers. Somebody from Anthropic please confirm.\n\nIs there an AWS CLI [Skillls.md](http://Skillls.md) that we don't know about? How is it this good?",

I've been a software developer for 30 years now and that's how I think.  My instructions to Claude are good enough for it to figure out my intent and to continue to search for a solution until it finds it.  I'm guessing my instructions to Codex are NOT clear enough for it to understand, nor does it really care about the context.  It's trying to execute exactly what I told it to do, and if it can't, then it simply stops.\n\nWhen I want my app pushed to a dev server for testing, I want it pushed.  I don't care how it does it or what the steps were. I want to be able to enter the URL and have the app appear.  Claude does a much better job of getting me to that point.  This is especially true when setting up new servers, but you MUST go behind it to make sure you don't have gaping security holes.  \n\nBut honestly, with the latest versions of Sonnet and Opus, it very rarely puts me in an undesirable position, whereas Codex just tells me to go pound sand.",

But you can do this relatively safely, you never have to give Claude direct access to your creds if you use something like a Yubikey. And just keep an eye on your AWS expenses.

The speed and cost efficiency make it a no-brainer for the \"grunt work\" of coding. It rarely hallucinates simple libraries and follows instructions perfectly.\n\nHowever, I've noticed that when I'm dealing with really nasty architectural bugs or trying to plan out a system from scratch, Opus 4.5 is still the key. It seems to \"think\" a bit deeper about the implications of a design choice before suggesting it. If I'm stuck in a loop with Sonnet, switching to Opus usually breaks me out of it.\n\nCurious to hear what your workflows look like. Are you defaulting to Sonnet for everything now, or do you still keep Opus in the rotation for the heavy lifting?",

      "text": "I first started using ChatGPT, then migrated to Gemini, and found Claude, which was a game-changer. I have now evolved to use VSC & Claude code with a Vite server.\nOver the last six months, I've gained a significant amount of experience, and I feel like I'm still learning, but it's just the tip of the iceberg. These are the rules I try to abide by when vibe coding. I would appreciate hearing your perspective and thoughts.\n\n\n# 10 Rules for Vibe Coding\n\n**1. Write your spec before opening the chat.**\nAI amplifies whatever you bring. Bring confusion, get spaghetti code. Bring clarity, get clean features.\n\n**2. One feature per chat.**\nMixing features is how things break. If you catch yourself saying \"also,\" stop. That's a different chat.\n\n**3. Define test cases before writing code.**\nDon't describe what you want built. Describe what \"working\" looks like.\n\n**4. \"Fix this without changing anything else.\"**\nMemorize this phrase. Without it, AI will \"improve\" your working code while fixing the bug.\n\n**5. Set checkpoints.**\nNever let AI write more than 50 lines without reviewing. Say \"stop after X and wait\" before it runs away.\n\n**6. Commit after every working feature.**\nReverting is easier than debugging. Your last working state is more valuable than your current broken state.\n\n**7. Keep a DONT_DO.md file.**\nAI forgets between sessions. You shouldn't. Document what failed and paste it at the start of each session. ( I know it's improving, but still use it)\n\n**8. Demand explanations.**\nAfter every change: \"Explain what you changed and why.\" If AI can't explain it clearly, the code is likely unclear as well.\n\n**9. Test with real data.**\nSample data lies. Real files often contain unusual characters, missing values, and edge cases that can break everything.\n\n**10. When confused, stop coding.**\nIf you can't explain what you want in plain English, AI can't build it. Clarity first.\n\n\nWhat would you add?\n\n",

Spoiler: your total score was 1.7 points. \n\nThen:\n\n1. It’s actually more like write a whole document ecosystem before coding, and you definitely do that AFTER opening the CLI. So…definitely no.\n\n2. Sort of, but covering lot of smaller features in one instance is fine. 0.7 points awarded. \n\n3. No. Describe what you want to build. Sure, you can then chat about what working means, that’s part of the conversation. \n\n4. Not necessary, no need to memorize that because it’s not needed with clear instructions, I’d personally never say that.\n\n5. lol…are you on drugs?? FIFTY lines?

I wanted to see if an AI tool could actually handle a complex systems project—managing raw memory, concurrency locks, and specific disk structures—without turning into a mess.\n\n**My takeaway:** I’m honestly incredibly proud of how this turned out. The tool is capable of high-level engineering if you guide it properly.\n\nIt didn't just \"write code.\" I would explain the system design (e.g., \"Here is how the RAID parity calculation needs to handle a missing disk\") and it would implement the logic in valid Rust. I handled the architecture and the safety audits; Claude handled the implementation details.\n\nThere’s a lot of noise about AI writing bad code, but looking at the `raid/` or `crypto/` modules in this repo, the quality is solid. It’s clean, it follows the project's strict `no_std` rules, and it passes the tests.\n\nIf you know exactly what you want to build, this tool is a massive time-saver.\n\n**Repo:** [**https://github.com/artst3in/lcpfs**](https://github.com/artst3in/lcpfs)",

If you take a look at the product, it’s seriously bloated, mismatched features, just a messy product. Sure it has more features than you could probably build yourself but the quality of those features is so low that I would rather much less features and a product that actually works and makes sense than some TEMU clone.",

Lmk if theres any feedback/improvements we could make :)\n\n  \nBtw super super cool use case and really love the intricacy with what youve built the architecture with. Some things that stood out to me were state management throuh temporal graphs and also how you're running polling -- how complicated was the orchestration piece? Also, there's a few ways you can use agentmail for state management, happy to riff on any ideas there!",

      "text": "I've been using Claude Code for larger projects and kept running into two problems:\n\n1. Context compaction - Claude would forget what it was doing mid-task\n2. Serial execution - Complex features took forever when Claude could only do one thing at a time\n\nSo I built Claude Swarm - an MCP server that fixes both problems.\n\n**How it works**\n\nThe orchestrator pattern separates concerns:\n\n* Orchestrator (main Claude): Plans work, monitors progress, makes decisions\n* Workers: Focused Claude Code sessions running in tmux that implement individual features in parallel\n\nState lives in the MCP server, so when context compacts, Claude just calls orchestrator\\_status and you're back in action.\n\n**Features**\n\n* Parallel workers\n   * Run up to 10 Claude Code instances simultaneously via tmux\n* Competitive planning\n   * For complex features, spawn two planners with different approaches and pick the best plan\n* Confidence monitoring\n   * Detect when workers are struggling before they fail\n* Real-time dashboard\n   * Web UI at localhost:3456 to watch everything (only active when the swarm is running, and may be buggy - feel free to submit an issue)\n* Auto-retry\n   * Failed features automatically retry up to 3x\n* Git checkpoints\n   * Commit after each completed feature\n\n**Fair warning**\n\nThis eats through your 5-hour usage limits quickly since you're running multiple Claude instances in parallel. If you're on the Max $200 plan you should be able to get a solid long coding session out of it, but keep an eye on your usage.\n\n**Inspiration**\n\nThis was inspired by some great research on long-running agents:\n\n[\"Effective harnesses for long-running agents\"](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents)\n\n[\"MAKER: Solving a Million-Step LLM Task with Zero Errors\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09030)\n\n[\"Multi-Agent Collaboration via Evolving Orchestration\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19591)\n\nAlso, [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1psfhbu/skill_has_cc_consistently_work_hours_on_its_own/), which decided to not share the MCP or skill, so I made my own lol.\n\n\\---\n\nInstallation instructions available on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cj-vana/claude-swarm).\n\nWould love feedback! This is my first MCP server and there's definitely room for improvement. Feel free to submit feature requests, issues, and questions on the GH.\n\n  \n **Update:** Been working on this since the original post. New stuff:\n\n* Protocol governance - Define rules for what workers can/can't do. Block access to .env files, restrict which tools they can use, prevent git pushes. Workers can even propose their own rules (with your approval)\n* Automated reviews - When all workers finish, it automatically spawns code review and architecture review workers. They check for bugs, security issues, coupling problems, test coverage gaps\n* Confidence monitoring - Multi-signal detection for when workers are struggling. Catches issues before they spiral\n* Competitive planning - For complex features, spawn two planners with different approaches and pick the better plan\n* Session controls - Pause/resume sessions, better stats tracking\n\n  GitHub has the latest. Thanks for all the feedback on the original post!",

I will spend 5-6 hours on this. Then I will tell Claude to use “super planner” to create an implementation plan and give it to “master orchestrator”.\nThis kicks off a process where I will have a web dashboard to monitor progress, “they” leave me questions for any blockers and I can leave them notes to answer or adjust the plan, it spawns a task that sleeps for 15 minutes and then wakes, compares the progress to the plan - updates a changelog and add a warning file in .state for any drift, then a task spawns a Claude for each separate work item that can be done in parallel, then a code review task spawns to review code, checkpoints are built in the implementation plan - there is a separate checkpoint agent that gates certain things before the process can move to step 2, there is a security review at a certain step, it has a checklist of things to verify, a red team agent attempting to find flaws, blah blah - it is a massive waste of tokens I am sure BUT over night it can create what would take me more than 2 weeks by hand or 2-3 days with copilot",

Not with this particular MCP server, but with a very similar approach based on Anthropics article and their demo they shared on GitHub.\n\nIt's really all about tasks with verifiable steps along the way where you can determine up front exactly what it is you're looking for. I've built a HTML viewer with an agent inside of it, that can turn meeting transcript or other documents into standardized webpages. \n\nThat worked, but I wanted to make it work properly with user rights. Metadata that can be accessible, but html data that can't unless logged in. A sharing system like Google docs with viewers, editors and owners. Password protected pages. Etc.\n\nI spent almost 2 hours planning it out, across about 13 steps, each step contains 15-20 verifiable measures and tests through APIs, and having the model testing it across different accounts using playwright.\n\nAgain, 2 hours of planning, verifiable steps, Claude churning along, starting up new sessions automatically, step by step, each step starting with verifying the previous step. \n\nIt worked, Claude worked for 11 hours straight. Clean code, worked as intended.\n\nDoing this right takes a LOT of work upfront. It's still much better than working with Claude for 4-5 hours straight to get it done.",

Next we will do this.” And you have to prompt it to move on to the next phases in the plan. You can also run into issues with Claude forgetting steps from the plan due to compaction. With this MCP server you can “reliably” one shot large edits and feature adds. It saves a barebones plan to a file that the workers reference so you don’t lose as much in compaction. Although, if sub agents work well for you, definitely keep using them. I don’t get anything out of anyone using this, just works well for my use case when I wanna just have a YouTube video on or a tv show and not have to come back to the chat every 5-10 minutes. I can let this run for like an hour to an hour and a half before I check on it and it’s gotten a ton of work done, with relatively low error rates compared to when I’m using sub agents or just the main Claude agent.",

          "text": "This is very good - you have great thinking about this. You have lots of nice elements for various things. If this is your original thinking, then kudos. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on other bottlenecks within agentic coding that could be overcome (and, of course, when you remove some bottlenecks, others will be revealed - and overcoming those). \n\nWhat you've described is a nice, modular system. Let's expand it - go deeper on planning for more complex features. There must be lots of resources dedicated to planning - as you know, a rotten plan can lead to lots of wasted time. So, we want information for this plan's structure, it's lifecycle, events, and access - all what we can call 'protocols'. \n\n  \nWe want to propagate the plan with contextually rich information - a node in a task graph could contain references of how to find a particular dependencies documentation, or, even, we could have prepared a particular section of that (dependency) documentation for access - and now, we can say 'access x tool if you find the documentation insufficient' - and that tool could route to another agentic workflow - and all this state could be managed in that MCP server, or, even, frankly, an MCP server that is part of a larger network of MCP servers that perhaps all cater to this Task Graph or the currently considered agentic system... \n\n  \nWith enough standards (protocols, if you will) defined (and able to be altered/generated - and the side effects of such be handled, also with protocols!), you have lots of ground to stand on. These protocols are really just 'behavioral indices' for agentic workflows, but also, we could classify scripts/triggers as protocols as well, sure. Lots of ways to look at it - point is: 'behavior caterment/adherence'. \n\n  \nSo, granular, contextually rich, and protocol-bounded Task Graph synthesis. Delicious. Now, of course, we want to have this work delegated out, yes? Ah, yes, that's a whole thing - you can have entire configs/scripts/protocols associated with spawning the containers, checking behavior, all of that - and, you could imagine checks for various things - protocol adherences, basically, yeah? Hell, you could send information from it, given a particular state to trigger the send, and potentially update the Task Graph, for example. Perhaps some inconsistency was spotted in the documentation or code - (a) protocol(s) not adhered to (yet, also, adhered to, if this is triggered and handled, yes?) - we can handle side effects of such! We can have entire dedicated workflows for particular circumstances. But, what if you just want to get it running? First off, boo! Second off, continue reading.\n\n  \nWe can have all of this behavior emerge. We simply define baseline protocol classes - we can say protocol a depends on b, and p. c depends on p. b, and therefore a via b (an example of a hypothetical slither of a protocol system's definition) - We define these behavior caterments/adherences, initially - and, then, we can craft on top the ability to generate ones that depend on them, or even, new classes of baseline protocol, if required. As long as we have rules in place to enforce adherances, and of course deeply enforce it in our systems, we keep our data (context, code, agentic behavior) in check - the productivity is truly exponential. Of course, we need to define the proper environments initially, and there's a lot of work involved in all of this. BUT: Imagine you chart out this territory in your head, and put it to action - if your goal is to automate software, then this is what is required. It's required to increase reliability of Agentic Systems, and is massively being adopted at the bleeding edge. \n\n  \nI'm interested in your thoughts on this. Feel free to poke holes, of course.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve noticed that while `CLAUDE.md` is powerful, writing a truly effective one takes a lot of time. Most people just copy-paste generic templates that don't actually match their specific environment or tech stack.\n\nSo, I built an open-source skill called `agents-md-generator` that automates this properly. It’s not just a template dumper; it acts like a Setup Wizard for your AI Agent.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. **Smart Environment Detection:** It checks if you are running **Docker Compose**, **Laravel Sail**, or **Native/Host**. It reads your `package.json`, `composer.json`, `docker-compose.yml`, etc., to auto-detect your exact stack (Frontend, Backend, Testing framework, Linters).\n2. **Interactive \"Interview\" Mode:** It asks you specific questions about your workflow:\n\n* *What scan depth do you need?* (Quick 30s vs. Deep 5m traversal)\n* *Do you need Git Workflow rules?* (Branch naming, Commit format)\n* *Do you need Security guidelines?* (Env handling, Input validation)\n\n1. **Smart Updates (No Overwriting):** If you already have a file, it offers a **Merge Mode** to preserve your custom rules while adding new structure.\n2. **Cross-Compatibility:** It automatically handles `CLAUDE.md` and symlinks it to `AGENTS.md` so it works across different AI tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf) simultaneously.\n\n**Why I created this Repository:** I tried existing skill marketplaces but found them overwhelming—over 35,000+ skills, most of which seemed unverified or low quality. It was impossible to know what actually worked. And I wanted a standard way to onboard my AI agents to any new or existing project instantly, without missing context like \"how to run tests\" or \"where the docs are.\"\n\nIt's part of my **Awesome AI Agent Skills** repo. It’s free, open-source, and I’d love for you to try it out (especially the \"Deep Scan\" mode) and tell me what you think.\n\nUpdated: I've added the docker-local-dev skill to set up a Docker environment for projects. It combines with scripts to detect the Tech Stack, save tokens, and save disk space based on suggesting available images on your host machine and my experience working with Docker. If you use Nginx Proxy Manager, it can also recognize your usage and automatically suggest an external network to use.\n\n**Repo:** [https://github.com/thienanblog/awesome-ai-agent-skills](https://github.com/thienanblog/awesome-ai-agent-skills)",

Since I don't fully understand, I'll answer based on my understanding:\n\nThis skill is primarily for beginners, so it exists as a plugin, and users can uninstall it when they no longer need it. It's like a guide to help them get familiar with the CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md files. Once they gain experience, I think they'll optimize it themselves.\n\nRegarding the skill and command: I only wrote instructions for the AI ​​on how to detect projects based on my experience and available documentation within the skill, so the AI ​​can refer to and compare it, thus gathering as much context as possible. You can check out my skill in the repository; that should make it easier to understand what I'm talking about. \n\nThanks a lot! Hope you give it a chance 🤗",

      "text": "I've been on the 20x Max plan for a couple of months now. Started with Sonnet 4.5, but once Opus 4.5 dropped, I've been using it exclusively – absolutely love that model.\n\nHere's the thing: I can't get anywhere close to the usage limits. I've never even hit 40% of the 5-hour session limit or crossed 30% of the weekly limit. So I'm considering downgrading to 5x Max.\n\nFor context, my usage pattern:\n\n* No autonomous mode\n* One MCP (Exa) + a bunch of skills\n* Heavy sub-agent usage for research (like, *a lot*)\n\nAnd I still can't hit the limits.\n\nSo my question for those on the 5x Max plan: how are the limits working out for you? My main concern is that downgrading might reduce my access to Opus 4.5, which I definitely don't want 😅",

I've spent about 2-3 hours a day for the last 2 years on the [My Call Bag](http://MyCallBag.com). \n\nI created it with the help of AI. Initially using ChatGPT but for the last year I've exclusively used Claude Code.\n\nI create things myself, as an eye doctor, would find useful and/or interesting. Claude Code has made the process so much easier and iterating has become so efficient that the app gets better every month.\n\nThe features I'm most proud of is a self-calibrating eye chart that actually uses the viewing distance as measured by the True Depth camera to calibrate itself. It also has a LiDAR tool to measure the protrusion of eyeballs for various disease states like thyroid eye disease. And has simulators to replicate eye disease and various intra-ocular lenses for cataract surgeries. \n\nThere are too many features to list and its already become probably the most popular eye care app for iOS with over 10,000 users! Its free to try and I have both a one-time purchase and subscription option. I know for most coders here its not useful but I thought it was a cool app built 95% with Claude Code!",
