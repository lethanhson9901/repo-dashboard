              "text": "Yes, actually! I was genuinely surprised by how much more I could pinpoint than I initially expected. Being able to visualize the token breakdown changed my workflow. \n\nHere are the examples of inefficiencies I found and fixed:\n\n**1. Heavy MCPs & Large Files Crashing the Context**\n\nI noticed that tools like the typescript-lsp-mcp would sometimes return 10k+ tokens in a single call. When that happens, Claude basically loses its mind and becomes \"dumb\" for the rest of the session. The same thing happened sometimes with the context7 MCP or when reading massive files. Also, seeing this context bloat for large tsx files visually forced me to refactor my codebase into leaner, smaller files. I also caught it reading large, unexpected files under the hood, which I immediately added to .claudeignore.\n\n**2. The Cost of \"Lazy\" File Mentions**\n\nI used to be lazy and wouldn't explicitly \\`@\\`-mention files. I realized this forces Claude to use the find the proper file via \\`Grep\\`, and use \\`Read\\` tool to go hunting for the right context, which wastes a ton of tokens. But directly pinpointing files automatically loads those files into context without any tool calls. So I found that pinpointing and exactly mentioning specific files  increases the task completion rate - especially if I had a lot of files to mention.\n\n**3. Automatic \"Skills\" are Probabilistic**\n\nI realized Claude doesn't automatically trigger custom skills as often as you'd think. Leaving it up to the agent to find and invoke the right skill on its own is inefficient and hit-or-miss. I learned it's way more token-efficient to just explicitly instruct it to use a specific skill right from the get-go.\n\n**4. Layered \\`CLAUDE.md\\` Architecture**\n\nInstead of having one massive \\`CLAUDE.md\\` file that eats up context on every single turn, it's way more effective to build a well-structured, layered \\`CLAUDE.md\\` system (e.g., directory-specific instructions). Keeping the instructions short, concise, and localized to each layer saves a huge amount of context.\n\nObviously, I didn't invent any of these tips—they are pretty well-known best practices floating around the community. But honestly, reading about them is one thing; actually seeing the token drain happen live in my own sessions and to get live notification every time, hits completely different. \n\nLet me know if you catch any other interesting patterns in your own workflow!",

We spend a lot on orchestration overhead just deciding which tasks need Opus vs Sonnet. A flatter capability curve means simpler routing logic, fewer costly escalations, and more autonomous agent runs. Curious whether the \"approaching Opus-level\" holds up on multi-step reasoning chains, not just single-turn benchmarks — that's where Sonnet has historically fallen apart for us.",

This year marks my 20th year in the business.\n\nSome prominent people are already comparing writing code by hand with \"assembly line work\". I'm reading articles/tweets where Google, Microsoft, Anthropic and OpenAI engineers claim they don't write code anymore, that everything is written by AI. But of course because these are also the companies earning millions through these models, this could also be marketing fluff.\n\nThough, today I spoke someone working at some big corporate high tech company and he told me the same thing, they we even allowed to burn through as many tokens as they like, no limits. He told me his colleagues are now solely reviewing code created by agents, basically what those AI companies tell us.\n\nAs someone who's really good at his craft, I have a high standard for code quality. Sure, claude/gemini/openai can generate scripts doing stuff I couldn't image 5 minutes ago in 1 minute. Really impressive and unreal. But I also find myself discarding lots of code because it's not the best way to do it, or it's not what I asked for. Maybe I need to get better at prompting, anyway.\n\nWhat I wanted to learn is what your experience is as a senior software engineer working at a startup, scale-up or fortune 500 company.

It took me weeks of watching what other people do, and then trying to build my own version using different agents and subagents, to really get it.\n\nIf your daily driver is currently Claude Code, go dig into their docs, which are decent. See what it can do, and if you’re not sure, ask Claude or go look up how other people are doing it on YouTube. (Maybe you want to learn about agents or skills, for example.)\n\nI’d suggest starting off by building things up, one by one. Start with making some specialized agents that you manually call, then wire those up as subagents and have a coordinating “orchestrator” call those subagents. Finally try out some of the “looping” or “agent team/swarm” tools. I only say to go through these levels one by one, just so you can understand how they build on top of each other.\n\nIf you want some examples of agent files, I open sourced the collection of agents I made for GitHub Copilot: https://github.com/ShepAlderson/copilot-orchestra\n\nThey aren’t “perfect” for Claude, but they are very close. Would need some tweaks for things like tools or such, but Claude itself can do a great job “converting” these to agent files for itself. Maybe give that a try and see what you can do with it.",

You already have that skill as dev most likely. I avoid the plugin/MCP sprawl and just roll my own tooling (task tracking, specs, etc.)—they're just prompts anyway. Once you know what you need, then look for existing tools.\n\n2/ What surprised me: this led to better code, not just more code. As a lead, I've shipped countless rushed features with technical debt. AI unlocks a tireless workforce for all that \"good but tedious\" work we'd normally skip. Today a colleague needed a long but simple refactor—a year ago we'd have ignored it. Done, without breaking a stride.\n\n3/ The mental space freed from menial work is massive. You focus on design, trade-offs, and architecture. You can choose better options that would've been \"too much work.\"\n\nTry a constraint: don't write a line of code yourself for a week. See what happens.",

Many talk about AI taking jobs and, while that may be true, the more nuanced (and hopefully correct statement) is that it’s reshaping how we do our jobs. Perhaps the days of painfully typing each line of syntax are gone as we shift towards shaping the specifications and generating the code.\n\nHere’s an interesting angle that’s less talked about as well- LLMs are trained on data released under different licenses. The generated code may be close enough to the original source that the owners may claim its subject to their licensing terms. My company explicitly disallows the use of AI on externally released products for this reason. It’ll be interesting to see how the legal aspects of this are addressed over time.\n\nPoint is, I think there will always be a need for people to write (or manage the generation of) code but how many engineers are required and how they work may drastically change. At least this is what I tell myself so I can sleep at night for now :)",

Since you're referencing OUTSIDE of your codebase, explicit instructions to assess file names and crawl is probably your best bet. I would simply not recommend using Claude on codebases you haven't personally set up for use. You can do it, but be prepared to burn a lot of tokens making it happen.\n\nWe use a slightly different approach in a different part of the codebase similar to skills that has the top of each file contain a one line string of text detailing what the file is about. \n\nClaude is aware of this structure via its CLAUDE.md and uses it regularly. \n\nI also have a \"context gatherer\" skill which gives explicit instructions on listing files in certain parts of the codebase for context with instructions to go deeper. \n\nAnother skill called \"trace data flow\" which uses an efficient LSP MCP for helping it find references has also been really nice. Its usual grep approach is often very token heavy and finds way too much fluff. This is something we all normally do when we're planning refractors or debugging, so you can see how these start to play off one another.\n\nThe trick is to think of tiny, sharp tools/processes.

Sometimes it fails, but when it does it's normally not subtle failures it's like a disaster zone so then I just do it myself. \n\nI've hooked up jira to it so tickets get a first pass by Claude attempting it and it opens a PR. 9/10 times it works great. \n\nI use a lot of microservices with well defined responsibilities and API spec which I've built. Claude without this is a lot worse. It doesn't know where to look in big monorepos and really struggles. Microservice repos it breezes through... As long as you don't have giant thousand line files - it seems to struggle a lot with editing large files. \n\nBiggest help is telling it where to put the change and doing one change a time. So if for example I want to update my client library for an API because I wrote new endpoints, then I have it generate swagger docs from comments in the codebase then have it use the swagger doc to update the client library in x folder to support the new doc. This is two calls to Claude one to make the doc and another to use it for a work product. If I have it do both it can goof up. \n\nClaude fails like once every 25 tasks when I use it this way which is better than most engineers. I also know other coworkers who really struggle getting good output and I'm not sure why their experience is so much worse than mine.",

I think thats down to the fact they have lot less experience. Im close to 20y. What i find useful personally is to write something well designed and after the good steucture is created let llm extend it. That works a lot better than letting llm write it from scratch.\n\nAlso when i use llm i usually have to cleanup the output. For personal projects after work by llm usage is huge. But for a commercial project especially with many juniors in the team, i have to write code manually for some things.\n\nArguably i could sit down and make the design and get llm to code it instead of doing it manually. But writing it is part of thinking about it. The same way tdd testing it forces you to think about it. Even if you design it well on paper you don’t know how it feels to maintain it until you actually write code.\n\nMaybe its just me or biased but i see my hand written code is being extended easy with llm is easy to review the changed and is modular. I see lot of other code although llm can extend it its very hard to review and maintain.\n\nI think its worth the investment. You spend the time and build something solid hand made, with the right interfaces and the right tests, then you give it juniors to vibe code and you know they wont screw up.\n\nI think those measures like x% of code are bad way to see it. I even if i write 100% hand made code if that enables everyone else to vibe code then i would call it a success.\n\nI think its a lot easier for a senior to vibe code. But junior devs tend to make a mess. The same goes for tests. Some parts of the code become not testable. The person who wrote the code does not understand that because tests were vibe coded. But if you set the right structure at start it all flows naturally.",

I never will be in that vibe coding camp of trust it implicitly. But I also have decades of experience to fall back on in knowing what to look for when reviewing it's work. But I will say so far I have been very impressed with the help it has given me. Any time I ask it to do something, it's gotten me no less than 90% of the way to a final product. And that has not just been coding, it's been documentation tasks, and I've been giving Claude cowork some things to do at home. \n\nI'm having to actively think in a way to give it things to do - that's the biggest change for me so far, and finding that balance between when to do it myself versus when to ask it for help will come in time. I also set major guardrails on it, i tell it that it cannot commit anything, so there is always fallback places set up. And sometimes I simply use plan mode just to generate a to-do list for a task and then do it myself. \n\nI'm glad I waited through the period of early adoption and let others work the initial kinks out, but for me at least, all the positive press claude has been getting seems warranted. \n\nI think us experienced senior devs aren't going anywhere. Because what we have that AI does not and will not have any time soon is an understanding of the \"why\" part of coding. What's the business logic behind it, why are decisions being made that result in us having to write these tools and features. Combine that with experienced eyes that can review the work of AI tools and decide if it's correct or not. \n\nJunior devs? That's another story. I would hate to be a newbie in this day and age, because they are going to have to learn just as we did, there is no replacement for experience, but at the same time stay on top of the changes in tools, and remember these are TOOLS.",

          "text": "I’ve been in the industry about 15 years, and yeah, it’s been a big shift. It feels on the magnitude of infrastructure as code or the shift from colocation to cloud.\n\nI would say I use agents for about 90% of my code, similar to others who answered here. I remember when I first realized that agents could write code almost as well as me (thinking back to the Sonnet 4 days, and even a bit of the Sonnet 3.7 days, though less so). I had a few months of deep existential crisis, and feared I needed to hurry up and skill up into a trade that’s more physical and not connected to “knowledge work”. I was feeling deeply “left behind” and had attached so much of my self worth to my ability to produce working and efficient code.\n\nIt was when I realized that agentic tools are just that, tools, that I kinda snapped out of it and dug in. I heard someone say “It’s not AI that will replace you, it’s the engineer who knows how to use AI that will”, and that really stuck with me and lit a fire under my ass. I will be the engineer who knows how to use AI.\n\nI really dug in, spending my off hours to push the boundaries and try new things. While I’m not yet permitted to use all the tools at work yet, I’m practicing on my own projects and slowly my company is making progress with allowing us to use agentic tools. What we’re seeing is that the senior devs who have been in it with building and running the product, are the ones seeing the most benefit. Anecdotally, the “architect” folks are actually having a harder time with it. They have gotten so used to staying so high level that they don’t realize how much goes into breaking down goals and tasks into work people/agents can do, never mind the fact they haven’t actually touched code in years. Juniors are one area I don’t have direct vision into, as my team currently doesn’t have anyone below about an “engineer II” level these days.\n\nAnywho, this is all to say that, what I realized was it wasn’t the code itself where I added value and the act of writing code isn’t why I got into this business. I got into this because I like building things, and the way to do that was to write code. I still love building things, I’m just working at a higher abstraction now. It’s more code review for sure, but I’ve always enjoyed reviewing code. I’m building faster and even cleaner than ever, frankly. My code is even more well tested. Is it “easy”? No, not at all. In fact, I would say I spend more mental energy now than I did in years past. I spend more mental energy thinking through requirements and crafting prompts to get what I want. I spend my time and energy setting up systems to act as guide rails and to help the agents do even more consistent and reliable work, quickly. In some ways, I have become a bit of a manager. 🤷\n\nSpeaking of managers, that’s one role I’m worried for. Having used agents for my own side projects, they are more orderly and well planned than I’ve ever had, even at work with the best managers I’ve ever known. A few hours going back and forth with an LLM and I have a more concrete and clear plan with goals, user stories, acceptance criteria, and decision documentation than I have _ever_ seen a manager produce. Having just gone through quarterly planning for my team and all the meetings that involved, both with the ICs and the time spent before, it was several weeks of work. Our managers/directors spend about 6 weeks before the start of each half to plan, then another couple weeks with the ICs to plan and kick off the quarter. Frankly, almost all of that can be replaced with a handful of hours with an LLM, spread out over however many days as you’d like. Put bluntly, I’d be much more worried if I was middle management, and to a slightly lesser extent, direct IC level manager or team/tech lead. I think we’re on the cusp of seeing a massive contraction of management, where the managers who have put in the effort to learn to make AI agents work for them will replace managers who don’t. I think it will likely end up with a single manager with AI being able to do the job of 3-5 managers. I’m not even a manager (have been previously) and I’m confident I could run a few to a handful of small teams of engineers equipped with AI agents at all levels, and we would absolutely ship like no tomorrow.",

(i use BDG which gives the llm access to the console.log and dev tools) \n\nat this point i usually do more manually  but you can either tell it to save the process in a bash script and create a review about it or check yourself. \n\nthe only reason I check myself  during this phase is because although LLMs are great at creating UI they sometimes get stuck on only one type of UI which might not be optimal for the user experience so I go through myself to make sure it feels right but this can be automated easily im just trying to learn and figure out thigns more in this aspect. \n\n\n\n",

So far so good, then I gave a meal and asked for alternative meals with same nutrition profile (calories, macros and fibers). It give me alterative meals with exact same calories but the other quantities (carbs, proteins, and fibers) didn't match pretty well. Then I suggested: \"Please use linear programming to make it as similar as possible\" and it replied \"Good idea\" then applied the technique I suggested and I obtained the result I wanted (it rebalanced the weights of the ingredients to get more precise match of the original meal). If I didn't know about linear programming in the first place it would never gave me the better solution.\n\n  \nI'm pretty much convinced the optimal results is using AI with as much human expertise involved as possible in the process.

But not all generated code is of high quality. You really have to be specific and know what you are doing. After fighting it for a long time thinking I needed to hand write everything, I realized I was wasting so much time at work and stressed out about things I didn't have to be stressed out about. Now I focus mostly on the problem and understanding what we are trying to do/build. I don't lose focus wondering how I'm going to solve it while at the same time zoning out in meetings not getting the full picture. \n\nWith LLMs I know that my main focus is now getting all the information I can, pushing back where needed, and completely understanding what I am trying to do. I create prompts not only with code repos but feature docs, slack or g chats, my own undersanding and all of that. \n\nI don't write code as much anymore, but I'm actually a much better and productive dev. I've been doing this for about 20 years, so I know what it takes to build things out and all of that. Maybe that helps. \n\n",

If you let AI do its own thing, it will write slop. But you can guide it to write well architected and maintainable code. I will often ask it to rewrite something and then make sure it remembers the pattern in the future by writing it down. I have a whole folder structure devoted to AI generated research, plans, documentation, and memories. With Claude able to reference those, it has gotten much better at writing code at a senior level.\n\nAI can write good code, but it's not cheap. I use at least 2-4 times the tokens it would take if I let AI do its own thing. I'd complain but...this is basically true of developers as well.  Good code isn't cheap and likely never will be. \n\n(Note: I also have around twenty years of experience)",

I'm fortunate enough that my company invested in the tools, I'm literally spending $1000+ a month on my claude code usage, paid for by the company and my leaders have expressed explicitly that I should continue to use it heavily. Which makes sense, my time ain't cheap, so if $1000 gets me at least a 20% productivity boost that's a solid ROI\n\nHistorically I've had a really high bar for code quality. My colleagues would probably tell you I was the most critical on pr feedback. I don't come at it from a purely intellectual perspective and suggest frivolous changes, but rather I've been on calls at 3am and had to be able to quickly understand a system that was foreign to me, debug and apply a fix. So if I look at your code and can't quickly figure out what the fuck you're trying to do, it doesn't meet the bar. Code comments should always tell me why, code should be self explanatory as to the what or how. Full stop.\n\nNow as for today. I've lightened up quite a bit on my review process and quality bar, because through that same lens I've created skills and processes using AI to achieve the same goal. Literally just this week I had to debug an issue with a container that was crashlooping and it was a pita to get what I needed to debug before it crashed. I used Claude code to help stand up a side car to the container in minutes, grab a heap dump, then read the heap dump and help find most likely causes. Faster than I ever couldve reading code or logs or anything by hand we narrowed it down to a problem with the ORM's (I fucking hate ORM's for this reason) default query behavior.\n\nNow where I struggle a bit is if we say okay, we have the problem solved then, now that makes Claude a critical cog in our infrastructure and ability to maintain it. I'm not sure that's the best. But right now, it works great in a real production environment. I still read code myself. I still drop feedback. But I let a lot more go than I would've before and I leverage a combination of anthropic's pr review skill plus some homebrewed skills to help find the gaps. I've been shipping more code than before. It's almost exclusively AI generated and I don't bother with looking at the diffs until I've manually tested it and put it up as a draft pr. Then I self review, both with my eyes and the aforementioned ai review skills. Then I ping my team when I'm ready.\n\nI still try to keep PR sizes reasonable though. If I get around anywhere above a few hundred LOC, not including codegen or tests, I try to reign it in and have blocked more than 1 or as not reviewable due to size.",

Style guides, references to MISRA. However, it's better to break up a task instead to allow for more efficient context overhead.\n\nPlanning code:\nA long time ago I learned the trick \"Tell AI what you want, but ask it to review what you want, ask questions about it, and generate a prompt for you. Feed THAT prompt back into AI). Claude can do this automatically to some degree, but the obra-superpowers plugin gives you commands like /brainstorm /write-plan and /implement-plan. These commands walk you through the entire process of idea to implementation. This greatly helps the quality of output and adherence to the goals.\n\n\nCorrecting code:\nHave two more separate agents to then perform a review of \"Does this satisfy the logical requirements of the feature\" and \"Does this code meet my standards according to a custom standards skill\"\nI had Claude generate three commands/skills for me.\n/Review-branch \"Does this code do what the original goal was and does it align with the repo\"\n/Review-standards \"Does this code comply with MISRA standards? Does it use conventional like YODA or always bracing control structures?\"\n/Review-all \"How shitty is the codebase origin/main currently?\"\n\n\nIt's not currently a drop-in expert to your standards, but in less than a week I've been able to tweak and play with things to the point that it's pretty dang close.\n\nEdit: I'm 10 years deep in safety-critical embedded systems.",

I’m still figuring it out, but honestly? It’s great. I can produce faster and for things that are new and don’t have pre established patterns for us, I can set the standard.\n\nMy only complaint is that it sometimes causes people to not know what’s going on. I had a new API endpoint to write integration tests for, and I started by hand and asked the engineer who wrote the framework and everything in it how to debug it. She said “Just ask AI”. In the end, that’s what I did and it worked, but the fact that I couldn’t do normal debugging steps kind of concerned me. Sure, I got a test that worked, but I do think not writing it yourself forces you to maybe lose some of that debugging skill? Then again, as I said, it’s been a week, so I’m new.\n\nThe best analogy I can apply is kind of like reading a PowerPoint vs writing down the content. I don’t know about you, but I learn a lot better by writing. I can explain to you every little choice then. I don’t like the thought of AI generating something and then it being asked about in a PR why I chose to do something one way instead of another and my only response being “AI said so”, you know?",

And as it was very helpful, but many times it was as you said, the code wasn't written the best way, or not what I asked for. Most of the time the code I got either needed some tweaking, or it was just quicker to fix it myself, than try to get GPT to do it. Things have improved dramatically though. With Codex I have it make changes all over my entire codebase, completely hands off. It almost always writes the code properly, and most of the times way better than I could. Most of the time if the code isn't good it's because I didn't give it a good prompt. I still review the code, but if I do have to tweak it, it's very minor things that are just quicker for me to change than ask Codex again. I haven't built a complete app from the ground up using only AI yet. I think that is a lot more challenging but I plan to do that next. I would say that it's only a matter of months before I'll probably never write a line of code again. But as a software developer, the coding was never really my true value, it was in the design itself, which hasn't gone away, and hopefully wont anytime soon. I will admit that I am quite nervous about AI making us irrelevant, but there's nothing we can do to change where things are headed, so you're best bet is to learn these tools to make new software and let's hope for the best.

I think when using LLMs in coding there vibe coding which treats software as a black box which is an absolute no no for prod, and then there is AI assisted coding. Claude code and similar tools are extremely useful in this area. If your code base is well structured, especially in a well documented language like Java, you could get massive performance gains just by cutting time on busy work. If you’ve built system you might notice some features tend to mirror others structurally. Similar transactional modules and most master modules are structurally near identical except for their entity differences. In situations like these you can get the agent to generate entire features by mirroring existing features for new entities. Setting up the workflow to preview results layer by layer combined with Javas inherent strong types makes this a perfect use case. LLMs are amazing for identifying logical errors as well. Often time when I build a new feature before running and testing the endpoint I would ask the agent to navigate through the endpoint all the way to the db layer and verify no logical errors or anomalies. And they are really really good for documentation and auditing your code base, say you need compliance for a strict set of guidelines or you need to document a new feature in a specific format, Claude is your guy. I’m sure there are many more way to use it but this is how I have seen massive productivity gains in production while ensuring code quality and not losing control. Cuz no matter what the ai generate I can personally account for every semicolon in the code base.",

Not a weekend project - full stack with auth, RBAC, API layer, data tables, email system, S3 support, PostgreSQL local and cloud. No hand-written code - I describe what I want, review output, iterate.\n\nYesterday I ran a deep dive on my git history because I wanted to understand what actually happened over those 40 days. 312 commits, 36K lines of code, 176 components, 53 API endpoints.\n\nAnd the thing that stood out most wasn't a metric I expected.\n\n**The single most edited file in my entire project is CLAUDE.md. 43 changes.** More than any React component. More than any API route. It's the file where I tell Claude how to write code for this project - architecture rules, patterns, naming conventions, what to do and what to avoid.\n\nI iterated on the instructions more than I iterated on the code.\n\nThat kinda hit me. In a 100% AI-generated codebase, the most important thing isn't code at all. It's the constraints doc. The thing that defines what \"good\" looks like for this specific project.\n\nAnd I think it's exactly why my numbers look the way they do:\n\nFeature-to-fix ratio landed at 1.5 to 1 - way better than I expected. The codebase went from 1,500 to 36,000 lines with no complexity wall. Bug fix frequency stayed flat even as the project grew. Peak week was 107 commits from just me.\n\nEveryone keeps saying \"get better at prompting.\" My data says something different. The skill that actually matters is boring architecture work. Defining patterns. Setting conventions. Keeping that [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) tight. The unsexy stuff that makes every single prompt work better because the AI always knows the context.\n\nThat \\~30% of work AI can't do for you? It's not overhead. It's the foundation.\n\nAm I reading too much into my own data or are others seeing this pattern too?",

But an md file could maybe provide instructions on how to navigate the graph. The graph thing really has piqued my interest. But I've also not yet tried it. But to the larger point, I think we're definitely getting to the point where we don't need the models to be that much better. We need the tooling and infrastructure to support these models to be much better. Even if they 10x'ed the context size it wouldn't be enough for deep work in our main codebase. And that's why I'm so interested in these discussions about how people are setting up supporting frameworks. That's where the really interesting part of the work - to me - is happening. ",

[CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) is the \"team handbook\" - architecture rules, conventions, guardrails. Then each task gets a clear spec of what to build. The model decides how to implement it, but within those constraints.\n\nThe problems you're describing - creating random .env files, suggesting features nobody asked for - that's usually a context gap. Either the task wasn't specific enough about scope, or the guardrails don't explicitly say \"don't add things beyond what's asked.\"\n\nOnce I started treating every prompt like a handoff to a coworker - full context on what, clear boundaries on what not - the random stuff dropped way off.",

Buy a boat? you could take a vacation, buy a car, upgrade your house.. etc. \n\n  \nSame goes here. What is the opportunity cost to have Peter tied to Sam? from what I heard, Peter is actually being selfish here, his objective is \\*not\\* to build a company he did that already, he just wants to get to market as fast as possible and use an existing infrastructure to do it. I trust Peter 100% and he is going to do with OpenClaw and OpenAI that Palmer Lucky did with FB and DK1 headset.  It gave Palmer instant access to resources to build out faster. Same here, Peter said this is what he cares about most, and the $1B in funds and given existing resources he doesn't have to worry about running a company, he can just build to market. \n\n  \nThat said, Sam has diff motives and eventually he will flip the script and heads will butt and that's when Peter will depart. This happened many times inside of OpenAI that's how we got Anthropic, they were all the original phds from OpenAI that quit over Sam's shit.\n\nMany large tech companies hire someone to capture them so they only work on what you want. Also many times they will hire talent just to prevent competitors from having them even if they do nothing.. is better than helping your competitor. \n\nI think Peter will do good, and if Sam is smart he will merge Codex with OpenClaw and let Peter make the worlds' greatest dev studio. I just want good tools, I don't care who delivers first. So far Opus and Claude Code are king and that is coming from using it since it launched a year ago. I just started using Codex again with 5.3 and I have to say it is catching up fast. \n\n  \nAll in all this is exciting times. OpenAI taking Peter applies pressure on industry to develop more forks, Peter has the resources and star power to make something Elon-level world changing for devs. ",

Both companies suck for diff reasons, but to say OpenAI is better because they launched Codex as open source is not entirely true. I like it, don't get me wrong, it is a win for us, but not for the reasons you think. Once adoption crosses CC they will lock it down as competitors will build on Codex and like Cursor did to MS, eat their own lunch. \n\nIt's a nasty market so it will dictate only the nasty survive and OpenAI is the leader in the market so they have the largest target on their back and running out of money fast.

Instead of roleplaying like they’re a YouTube influencer who just found infinite money glitch for investing.\n\nGuys just: Brew install Claude-code ; claude ; Shift tab + shift tab (plan mode), and make sure to ask Claude to *document* reusable solutions and specs into MD docs. Play around and *share* your experiences, without needing to “sell” it.\n\nWrite what you wanted to write to Claude. For the love of all future developers, albeit it future you or a colleague — before exiting plan mode just drop “update/create MD docs and make sure Claude.md has a brief architecture file overview”.\n\nInstead of chasing the next big plugin. If I may give you all one golden tip.\n\n- Read the darn [release notes](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/releases). \n\nFor example:\n\nSimple performance improvement. Release notes mentioned this week hey we now allow backtick in MD docs.\n\nJust a prompt ask CC “to **auto** generate your architecture overview and summarize all your architecture docs, and detect symlinks make this a backtick command”. What it will do it will make a fixed structure for that in the file’s first line — there. Not a single plugin needed and not a minute wasted on AI written fillers. \n\n```\nmaster-control-repository/\n├── CLAUDE.md                    # This file - main instructions\n├── agents/                      # Agent workflow definitions\n│   ├── 01-requirements-analyst.md\n│   ├── 02-software-engineer.md\n│   ├── 03-code-reviewer.md\n│   └── coding-standards.md\n├── scripts/                     # Userscripts and automation tools\n│   └── gitlab-pipeline-monitor.user.js\n├── overall/                     # Shared settings across all projects\n│   └── .claude/\n│       ├── CLAUDE.md           # Universal guidelines\n│       └── settings.local.json # Universal permissions\n└── projects/                    # Project-specific configurations\n    ├── protest-upgrade/\n    │   └── .claude/\n    │       └── agents/         # Symlink to ../../../agents/\n    ├── project-1/\n    │   └── .claude/\n    ├──project-2/\n    │   └── .claude/\n    ├── project-3/\n    │   └── .claude/\n    └── project-4/\n        └── .claude/\n            ├── agents/         # Symlink to ../../../agents/\n            ├── commands/       # Symlink to ../../.claude/commands\n            ├── CLAUDE.md       # Home Assistant configuration guide\n            ├── settings.local.json\n            ├── check-entity-patterns.sh\n            └── quality-check.sh\n```",

Auto-memory is a great idea. Anthropic tried to accomplish it with just a single paragraph of instructions in the system-prompt. But we've all come to understand for tools and skills that without period reminders (via hooks), instructions in the system-prompt or [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) are useless. I believe that auto-memory is the same: I almost never see Claude use it, even at times it should.\n\nI took Claude's exact auto-memory system and added reminders for it [https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1r2fmuv/how\\_to\\_a\\_reminder\\_hook\\_that\\_works\\_for\\_swarms\\_ie/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1r2fmuv/how_to_a_reminder_hook_that_works_for_swarms_ie/) . With these reminders, I found myself benefiting from much better Claude-initiated auto-memory updates. They are definitely valuable. (I also found myself manually telling it every 30 minutes or so to clean up and organize its memory, because it wasn't doing that well itself. But I don't think this needs to be automated).",

Being able to arrange data in dimensions that each have their own context is powerful and Claude searching through .MD files isn’t a good way to do it.\n\nPersistent memory models are about the Agent developing recall, patterns, anti-patterns, specific contexts, rules and learnings etc. For myself I don’t just use a memory model that does that, but I use a memory model to move memory outside of (Claude) and make it LLM – independent. Claude isn’t transparent - I can’t read through files efficiently to tell me what it knows and it won’t give me the same answers every time, it’s essentially designed to have session memory and that’s it. Everything else is a desired feature but a clunky upgrade.\n\nMy memory model records performance evaluations between LLMs, handle persistence states for objects that exist outside of my app and data, and helps Claude understand the difference between Claude as a LLM, Claude Code and Claude as a specific version of a tool with a specific skill set optimised to specific tasks. It auto-delegates between models to improve quality, performance and token efficiency, prioritising model-comparisons to build insights and then using those insights to parallelise pipelines, avoid blockages and not make accidental reversions without being monitored.\n\nIt’s not all about memory, it’s about how you access the things you need out of it. It’s about being able to do knowledge graphs and map that over what Claude tells itself, and then use it work out what it’s not telling itself. \n\nYou can in theory perhaps do that with MD files but then Claude risks editing them whenever it gets stressed and panics - and if you have to put lots and lots of guide rails in your system from scratch each time you build projects, you’re either need to host that outside (Claude), or make your memory manager “smart enough” to manage any project.\n\nshodh-memory and MCP etc are being adopted for a reason and it’s not because they’re perfect. It’s because they’re the barest bones of something you can make act like a human that doesn’t forget.\n\nhaving node maps and being able to pull apart the different faces of your data and see when a “circle is circular” absolutely mission critical to almost any enterprise-grade project, especially if you’re handling sensitive data.",

      "text": "I use AI every day - developing with LLMs, building AI agents. And you know what? There are things where AI is still helpless. Sharing my observations.\n\n**Large codebases are a nightmare for AI.** Ask it to write one function and you get fire. But give it a 50k+ line project and it forgets your conventions, breaks the architecture, suggests solutions that conflict with the rest of your code. Reality is this: AI doesn't understand the context and intent of your code. MIT CSAIL showed that even \"correct\" AI code can do something completely different from what it was designed for.\n\n**The final 20% of work eats all the time.** AI does 80% of the work in minutes, that's true. But the remaining 20% - final review, edge cases, meeting actual requirements - takes as much time as the entire task used to take.\n\n**Quality vs speed is still a problem.** GitHub and Google say 25-30% of their code is AI-written. But developers complain about inconsistent codebases, convention violations, code that works in isolation but not in the system. The problem is that AI creates technical debt faster than we can pay it off.\n\nTell me I'm wrong, but I see it this way: I myself use Claude Code and other AI tools every day. They're amazing for boilerplate and prototypes. But AI is an assistant, not a replacement for thinking.\n\nIn 2026, the main question is no longer \"Can AI write code?\" but \"Can we trust this code in production?\".\n\nWant to discuss how to properly integrate AI into your development workflow?",

A regular person cannot even successfully *imagine* the right thing to build.\n\nWithout the constant failing that is part of the try-fail learning loop, junior developers will never become senior developers, and if they somehow do, they won't be the same - they'll be missing something.\n\n\n\n",

Especially with vibe coding tools it’s hard to know who is hard in the Dunning-Kruger curve and who has actual experience and knowledge.. of often the more seasoned software engineers are the ones with the least experience with agentic coding.. not least because it’s only gone from complete slop to “actually working” in the past 6 months or so. \n\nI saw the graph of the creator of MoltBot, Peter Steinberger and it mirrored my own journey precisely:\n\nhttps://steipete.me/posts/just-talk-to-it\n\nYou get taken in, feel like the master of the universe, run 18 instances simultaneously, figure out that the quality just isn’t there, learn and take 3 steps back until you have something that is 20% faster than before but not quite as good as if you had put your own mind to it fully.. and continue refining your approach because you know this is the future. \n\nThe biggest problem for me is that I have nearly perfect understanding of the code that I write myself, at least for a while, because I’ve written it myself and I remember each decision, each trade off and I went at human speed. \n\nThat’s gone with agentic coding. On a normal day you take 200 decisions, but none of really well thought out. You nudge the process but you don’t really control it. If you type the same code 5 times, you think “ok this is DNRY”, let’s refactor. You notice small stuff. You’re re-evaluating earlier decisions. You get a feel for the code. \n\nWith high velocity agentic coding the focus is always narrow. Or way too large. You can read the code, but you have no feel for it or how well it fits in. Decisions are temporary. The litmus test is to go in and debug a complex bug yourself: it’s like you’re working on someone else’s code. There may be comments but they’re 200 commits out of date. You find two separate systems doing the same thing.. then the veil lifts and you realize you should have been working on this yourself more and let the agent do less.. but now you’re lazy and spoiled 😔",

          "text": "I understand the point of the post and I believe many people have had that experience, but in my case the situation was quite different — for very specific reasons. The “AI losing context” part you mentioned in the beginning is something I’ve seen too, but in my experience it often comes down to workflow. My process is very structured: I describe the problem, explain how things currently behave vs. how they should behave, and I always ask for a detailed diagnostic report first. The model scans every relevant line connected to the issue and produces a micro-report before any implementation starts. If I introduce a second problem mid-process, sometimes the model temporarily focuses on the newest context and forgets the earlier thread — but that’s not a failure, it’s just how iterative conversations work. I simply stop it, remind it that there are two parallel problems, and once it acknowledges that and reiterates the first issue, I always ask again for a micro-report that covers the implementation impact of both fixes together before moving forward. With that level of guidance, I’ve never had it break my project.\n\nAnd yes — I did have very bad experiences before. With Cursor and GitHub Copilot, where I was exclusively using Claude Opus, my behavior and workflow were identical to what I described above — but it still wasn’t enough. In those cases I experienced at least 10 separate situations where the model literally broke my codebase and disrupted stability.\n\nIn my specific case, the real turning point *was* switching to GPT-5.2 Codex in VS Code. The exact same structured workflow that failed me before finally became stable and predictable. I don’t let AI work autonomously; I frequently stop it, bring it back to the architecture, and keep clear boundaries around what it’s allowed to change. In the root folder of my project I also maintain an MD file that acts as a “law” every agent must follow, with explicitly defined behavioral rules and restrictions. In that setup AI hasn’t created chaos for me — it has accelerated development without compromising the project’s structure. That’s why I don’t see all “AI coding” as the same; the difference between models and communication style makes a huge practical difference.\n\nJust so I’m not misunderstood — I’m not a developer and I never was, but I’m someone who knows in micro detail what I want, how something needs to look, and where I ultimately want to end up. That vision is very clearly defined in my head. Everything I wrote above refers strictly to my work on my own application, which has over 50k lines of code and is so complex that almost every class operates in synergy with others. I hope the Claude community won’t take this the wrong way — this is simply my personal experience while building something extremely complex, and at this point I’m already about 80% through the application.",

          "text": "Posts like this just remind me how far behind the average programmer is from the bleeding edge of what's possible with Agentic Coding today.\n\nThese criticisms applied maybe until late last year - but this year?  Claude Code will run until it meets its verification techniques.  It will loop over itself and check itself for quality, security, common errors, etc.  It will invoke endless static code techniques.   It can run playwright tests and postman tests and iterate on any work it does until the tests all pass (without changing the tests, like it would last year).  Humans can hardly be bothered to run tests at all and instead assume their CI pipelines catch problems.\n\nIt can be told to run, and try to break the system, find bugs, find holes - and it can do this all 24 hours a day - each pass can improve software quality.   First pass maybe not perfect, but 2 passes later? 5? 10?  That can all be done in minutes.\n\nI haven't seen a hallucination since Opus 4.5 came out - 4.6 is incredibly good at staying on task, breaking down problems and tasks into small chunks that compose into sophisticated systems.   Things like Get Shit Done are literal software development engines, all written in markdown that are just prompts and you can one shot complex projects pretty simply with the techniques used there.\n\nIf one can't write high quality code in today's CC/4.6 world than a human, then that's 100% a skill issue.  I see people making these claims who are still using some web ui with copy paste for coding.  I see people using ChatGPT and Gemini or Cursor or CoPilot instead of CC - none of these tools are indicative of the bleeding edge of this technology.\n\nPeople think that just using CC with prompts and in plan mode is on the edge of what's possible - it's not.  The new edge is starting off with a skill that asks what you want to achieve, flushes out all the requirements, ties them to must pass condition (like an api or ux test), writes it all out so it's not forgotten, validates presence of those tests, implements, reviews its work (with different agents), circles back, verifies everything on the list is done, runs quality checks, submits to other agent for final review and auditing, and then at the end of the day stands up a complete test environment and runs the complete suite of API and UX tests against the system to ensure no regressions.\n\nWhat I described just there has always been an ideal way of writing software that I've never seen a human team achieve - but guess what, Claude Code with 4.6 and techniques like [Get Shit Done](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done) can do all this in like 20 minutes and in much higher quality than any human team I've ever seen.\n\nThe people at Github and Google are all dogfooding their own stuff, like AntiGravity and CoPilot (calling Opus 4.6 from these tools is not the same) - so I can see why they're not more productive - but then you have Claude Code which is moving so fast no one can keep up - not even ChatGPT (whose products do suck).\n\nSo if you want to see why people think there's gonna be a massive disruption in tech, you need to learn this stuff - cause it's here and it's been possible and it's catching on fast.   The big contracts that Anthropic have been signing lately (like with Goldman Sachs) are indiciative of how valuable their tech is.\n\nI do believe the others may catch up, but they don't seem to be able to do anything correct (Gemini CLI, Antigravity, CoPilot, Codex) - meanwhile Anthropic just upgrades CC on a near daily basis.",

It can dig through 40 files in a few seconds and models like Codex Spark can write 1,000 tokens per second!\n\nBut they’re still kinda shitty at many forms of logic. This is why even the best models (Opus 4.6, Codex 5.3, Gemini 3.0 Pro) tend to produce rat’s nest code that often needs multiple prompts to clean it up.\n\nMy company has just started hiring. Our old code exercise is trivially defeated by Claude Code because it’s mostly just testing the dev’s basic knowledge and speed. So I’ve come up with a new exercise that relies heavily on spatial reasoning. You have to program a team of robots to deliver packages in a room that has obstacles. It’s a lot like a Zachtronics game, and you get scored on a number of criteria after each attempt.\n\nThe thing is, Claude and Codex generally fail on their first pass if you just say “Look at the level and solve it.”\n\nIf you have them look at the output and try again, they will eventually get a passing score but that can take 10+ minutes and the score is usually pretty bad. And now you’ve burned a ton of your time just to get a bad score. It comes up with plans where robots collide, get stuck for long periods, etc.\n\nBut most humans can look at it and say, “Oh, robot 3 just needs to go up at turn 18 and then go through the top door…” and suddenly you’ve got double the score that the LLM was able to hit.\n\nIn my own testing, I find that I get the best scores when I use a very fast/dumb model and give it a strategy.

The gotcha.. at the moment, there is not a structured name convention.\nI didn't saved the chat but this is what happened.\n\nREQUEST:\nI have the list of files you can read from file `input_list` . I need them to be moved this structure: folder \"title (date)` with inside `filename` where filename is the name they already have. How will you do it?\n\nANSWER: \nI will create a BASH script to extract title and date from actual file name , create the folder structure and move the file.\n\n\nME:\ngood, implement\n\nAND HERE BEGAN THE CAOS (I'll paraphrase now its answers but it's exactly what happened)\n\n1- I need to read the first 10 lines to search edge cases (I accepted)\n2 - he wrote a PYTHON script to do the moving (I rejected because he said it would have been bash)\n3- he apologies for the python and asked to read other 10 lines to search other edge cases (I told him to read full file so it will stop ask 10 lines at the time)\n4- he wrote a reusable bash script for the moving\n\n\nI tried to use the script, it was not working. It included a regex so complex that a second AI could not correctly escape after other 5 interactions.\n\n\nMy conclusion. Opus is good for standard request only and it completely overthink possible solutions. My request was obviously a 1 shot request and the easiest solution should have been a 1500 line file with a `mv` command for each line. Opus didn't even considered this as a possible solution.",

But there are other areas - simple tools, especially - where it is amazing. I've had a lot of fun writing a slack bot for my company using CC. And I'm trying to use what I'm learning in that process where AI does work to then understand why it fails in other cases and how we might overcome that. \n\n\nAt the same time, I also would not say that the ability to generate lines of code is not our real limiter either. Yes, there are businesses where this is the case. But I think for many it is not. I'm still trying to think about the likely ratio, but my feeling is that this second group is larger.  \n\n\nIt is about deciding what lines of code to write. Lines of code as measure of worth has always been a poor proxy. And AI is just making that even more obvious.\n\n\nMy biggest fear is the loss of junior devs. There is good evidence that AI is having the biggest impact from more senior devs. Which is not surprising. People who understand systems and architecture are going to be way better at what has become, essentially, an increased focus on requirements gathering and documenting. But the problem with replacing a team of juniors with a senior and a fleet of agents is where does the next generation of senior devs come from?\n\n\nApprenticeship programs are essential. I get that it's not in vogue to think too many quarters ahead, let alone years or decades. But replacing junior devs now with AIs is short sighted. I guess that's modern capitalism though...",

In my experience it leads to worse results when the plan is detailed. I will compact before executing the plan if there was a long back and forth before I was satisfied with the plan.\n\n- I try to leverage CC for the kind of tasks that wouldn't be worth doing by hand. This usually involves massive changes that aren't practical to to by hand, so that consumes a lot of tokens.\n\n- I make CC verify its output (compile, test, lint, etc)\n\n\nGuven that it is my employer who pays for the token and that this leads to high quality output I haven't really put too much effort into reducing costs. Whenever I tried some common approaches mentioned here I feel I get worse resulta or it takes slower to reach a level of quality I find acceptable.\n\nWhat does your setup look like?",

It doesn't do me any good to have 10 agents creating 10 times as much garbage when wrangling one agent can sometimes be a lot of work.  Sometimes I might run ClaudeCode in multiple IDE's where I'm doing different projects but even that is pretty rare.  E.g., web app in one window, SQL data analysis in another IDE at the same time. Or I'll have Claude pulled up in the browser.  But all of that is pretty rare.",

Been trying to build a project from scratch. Usually have Opus planning and Sonnet doing its work with 4 subagents (dev, ui, security, auditor)\nMy claude.md is not super detailed, I try to make sure to keep the context relevant and short, use agents where appropriate.\nI am not even talking about Opus 4.6, but a single compact takes about 4-5% of session limits on 5x plan with Opus 4.5. Any message to Sonnet immediately opens the door from 2%.\nAny UI bug, as i explain it, the search for the root cause uses about 55-60% of the context immediately. \nSo really not sure how you guys are managing to work 12h a day without hitting any limits. My experience is that even with sonnet 4.5 when i am vibecoding for bug fixes or new features in 2-3 terminals, i can get 3.5 hours or so from my 5x 5 hour session.",

So I'm not reviewing for bugs but for coding standards, maintainability, and architecture and usually Claude starts picking up on that stuff itself.\n\nPlus I have skills to have Claude make stacked changes, which dramatically reduces review fatigue, as well as skills to rebase the stack etc. if I make changes to an earlier review.\n\nSo by the time I seriously review the code, it's already in stacked changes, bugs found by CI have been fixed, code rabbit feedback integrated, etc. and it's a pretty easy review.\n\nThe only time it takes awhile is if there are nontrivial bugs I have to dig in, then Claude is only mildly helpful, and this is where I \\*really\\* use tokens by spawning a bunch of subagents to write debug scripts for a bunch of different hypotheses and gather data to try to parallelize debugging.  There tends to be a lot of VEERY long \"thinking\" blocks at this stage as we're already at a nontrivial problem.\n\nFor the RAM bottleneck, I have 256GiB on my dev machine, with 8TiB of storage for lots of worktrees and build artifacts.",

      "text": "## TL;DR\n\nI parsed Claude Code's local JSONL conversation files and cross-referenced them against the per-charge billing data from my Anthropic dashboard. Over Feb 3-12, I can see **206 individual charges totaling $2,413.25** against **388 million tokens** recorded in the JSONL files. That works out to **$6.21 per million tokens** — almost exactly the cache *creation* rate ($6.25/M), not the cache *read* rate ($0.50/M).\n\nSince cache reads are 95% of all tokens in Claude Code, this means the advertised 90% cache discount effectively doesn't apply to Max plan extra usage billing.\n\n---\n\n## My Setup\n\n- **Plan**: Max 20x ($200/month)\n- **Usage**: Almost exclusively Claude Code (terminal). Rarely use claude.ai web.\n- **Models**: Claude Opus 4.5 and 4.6 (100% of my usage)\n- **Billing period analyzed**: Feb 3-12, 2026\n\n## The Data Sources\n\n**Source 1 — JSONL files**: Claude Code stores every conversation as JSONL files in `~/.claude/projects/`. Each assistant response includes exact token counts:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"assistant\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-09T...\",\n  \"requestId\": \"req_011CX...\",\n  \"message\": {\n    \"model\": \"claude-opus-4-6\",\n    \"usage\": {\n      \"input_tokens\": 10,\n      \"output_tokens\": 4,\n      \"cache_creation_input_tokens\": 35039,\n      \"cache_read_input_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nMy script scans all JSONL files, deduplicates by `requestId` (streaming chunks share the same ID), and sums token usage. No estimation — this is the actual data Claude Code recorded locally.\n\n**Source 2 — Billing dashboard**: My Anthropic billing page shows 206 individual charges from Feb 3-12, each between $5 and $29 (most are ~$10, suggesting a $10 billing threshold).\n\n## Token Usage (from JSONL)\n\n| Token Type | Count | % of Total |\n|---|---|---|\n| `input_tokens` | 118,426 | 0.03% |\n| `output_tokens` | 159,410 | 0.04% |\n| `cache_creation_input_tokens` | 20,009,158 | 5.17% |\n| `cache_read_input_tokens` | **367,212,919** | **94.77%** |\n| **Total** | **387,499,913** | 100% |\n\n94.77% of all tokens are cache reads. This is normal for Claude Code — every prompt re-sends the full conversation history and system context, and most of it is served from the prompt cache.\n\n*Note: The day-by-day table below totals 388.7M tokens (1.2M more) because the scan window captures a few requests at date boundaries. This 0.3% difference doesn't affect the analysis — I use the conservative higher total for $/M calculations.*\n\n## Day-by-Day Cross-Reference\n\n| Date | Charges | Billed | API Calls | All Tokens | $/M |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Feb 3 | 15 | $164.41 | 214 | 21,782,702 | $7.55 |\n| Feb 4 | 24 | $255.04 | 235 | 18,441,110 | $13.83 |\n| Feb 5 | 9 | $96.90 | 531 | 54,644,290 | $1.77 |\n| Feb 6 | **0** | **$0** | 936 | 99,685,162 | - |\n| Feb 7 | **0** | **$0** | 245 | 27,847,791 | - |\n| Feb 8 | 23 | $248.25 | 374 | 41,162,324 | $6.03 |\n| Feb 9 | 38 | $422.89 | 519 | 56,893,992 | $7.43 |\n| Feb 10 | 31 | $344.41 | 194 | 21,197,855 | $16.25 |\n| Feb 11 | 53 | $703.41 | 72 | 5,627,778 | $124.99 |\n| Feb 12 | 13 | $177.94 | 135 | 14,273,217 | $12.47 |\n| **Total** | **206** | **$2,413.25** | **3,732** | **388,671,815** | **$6.21** |\n\n**Key observations:**\n- **Feb 6-7**: 1,181 API calls and 127M tokens with **zero charges**. These correspond to my weekly limit reset — the Max plan resets weekly usage limits, and these days fell within the refreshed quota.\n- **Feb 11**: Only 72 API calls and 5.6M tokens, but **$703 in charges (53 line items)**. This is clearly billing lag — charges from earlier heavy usage days being processed later.\n- **The per-day $/M rate varies wildly** because charges don't align 1:1 with the day they were incurred. But the **overall rate converges to $6.21/M**.\n\n## What This Should Cost (Published API Rates)\n\nOpus 4.5/4.6 published pricing:\n\n| Token Type | Rate | My Tokens | Cost |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Input | $5.00/M | 118,426 | $0.59 |\n| Output | $25.00/M | 159,410 | $3.99 |\n| Cache Write (5min) | $6.25/M | 20,009,158 | $125.06 |\n| Cache Read | $0.50/M | 367,212,919 | $183.61 |\n| **Total** | | | **$313.24** |\n\n## The Discrepancy\n\n| | Amount |\n|---|---|\n| Published API-rate cost | $313.24 |\n| Actual billed (206 charges) | $2,413.25 |\n| **Overcharge** | **$2,100.01 (670%)** |\n\n### Reverse-Engineering the Rate\n\nIf I divide total billed ($2,413.25) by total tokens (388.7M):\n\n**$2,413.25 ÷ 388.7M = $6.21 per million tokens**\n\n| Rate | $/M | What It Is |\n|---|---|---|\n| Published cache read | $0.50 | What the docs say cache reads cost |\n| Published cache write (5min) | $6.25 | What the docs say cache *creation* costs |\n| **What I was charged (overall)** | **$6.21** | Within 1% of cache creation rate |\n\nThe blended rate across all my tokens is $6.21/M — **within 1% of the cache creation rate**.\n\n### Scenario Testing\n\nI tested multiple billing hypotheses against my actual charges:\n\n| Hypothesis | Calculated Cost | vs Actual $2,413 |\n|---|---|---|\n| Published differentiated rates | $313 | Off by $2,100 |\n| Cache reads at CREATE rate ($6.25/M) | $2,425 | Off by $12 (0.5%) |\n| All input-type tokens at $6.25/M | $2,425 | Off by $12 (0.5%) |\n| All input at 1hr cache rate + reads at create | $2,500 | Off by $87 (3.6%) |\n\n**Best match**: Billing all input-type tokens (input + cache creation + cache reads) at the 5-minute cache creation rate ($6.25/M). This produces $2,425 — within 0.5% of my actual $2,413.\n\n## Alternative Explanations I Ruled Out\n\nBefore concluding this is a cache-read billing issue, I checked every other pricing multiplier that could explain the gap:\n\n1. **Long context pricing (>200K tokens = 2x rates)**: I checked every request in my JSONL files. The maximum input tokens on any single request was ~174K. Zero requests exceed the 200K threshold. Long context pricing does not apply.\n\n2. **Data residency pricing (1.1x for US-only inference)**: I'm not on a data residency plan, and data residency is an enterprise feature that doesn't apply to Max consumer plans.\n\n3. **Batch vs. real-time pricing**: All Claude Code usage is real-time (interactive). Batch API pricing (50% discount) is only for async batch jobs.\n\n4. **Model misidentification**: I verified all requests in JSONL are `claude-opus-4-5-*` or `claude-opus-4-6`. Opus 4.5/4.6 pricing is $5/$25/M (not the older Opus 4.0/4.1 at $15/$75/M).\n\n5. **Service tier**: Standard tier, no premium pricing applies.\n\nNone of these explain the gap. The only hypothesis that matches my actual billing within 0.5% is: **cache reads billed at the cache creation rate**.\n\n## What Anthropic's Own Docs Say\n\nAnthropic's [Max plan page](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing) states that extra usage is billed at **\"standard API rates\"**. The [API pricing page](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models) lists differentiated rates for cache reads ($0.50/M for Opus) vs cache writes ($6.25/M).\n\nAnthropic's own Python SDK calculates costs using these differentiated rates. The [token counting cookbook](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching#tracking-cache-performance) explicitly shows cache reads as a separate, cheaper category.\n\nThere is **no published documentation** stating that extra usage billing treats cache reads differently from API billing. If it does, that's an undisclosed pricing change.\n\n## What This Means\n\nThe 90% cache read discount ($0.50/M vs $5.00/M input) is a core part of Anthropic's published pricing. It's what makes prompt caching economically attractive. But for Max plan extra usage, my data suggests **all input-type tokens are billed at approximately the same rate** — the cache creation rate.\n\nSince cache reads are 95% of Claude Code's token volume, this effectively **multiplies the real cost by ~8x** compared to what published pricing would suggest.\n\n### My Total February Spend\n\nMy billing dashboard shows $2,505.51 in total extra usage charges for February (the $2,413.25 above is just the charges I could itemize from Feb 3-12 — there are likely additional charges from Feb 1-2 and Feb 13+ not shown in my extract).\n\n## Charge Pattern\n\n- 205 of 206 charges are $10 or more\n- 69 charges fall in the $10.00-$10.50 range (the most common bucket)\n- Average charge: $11.71\n\n## Caveats\n\n1. **JSONL files only capture Claude Code usage**, not claude.ai web. I rarely use web, but some billing could be from there.\n2. **Billing lag exists** — charges don't align 1:1 with the day usage occurred. The overall total is what matters, not per-day rates.\n3. **Weekly limit resets explain zero-charge days** — Feb 6-7 had 127M tokens with zero charges because my weekly usage limit had just reset. The $2,413 is for usage that exceeded the weekly quota.\n4. **Anthropic hasn't published** how extra usage billing maps to token types. It's possible billing all input tokens uniformly is intentional policy, not a bug.\n5. **JSONL data is what Claude Code writes locally** — I'm assuming it matches server-side records.\n\n## Questions for Anthropic\n\n1. **Are cache read tokens billed at $0.50/M or $6.25/M for extra usage?** The published pricing page shows $0.50/M, but my data shows ~$6.21/M.\n2. **Can the billing dashboard show per-token-type breakdowns?** Right now it just shows dollar amounts with no token detail.\n3. **Is the subscription quota consuming the cheap cache reads first, leaving expensive tokens for extra usage?** If quota credits are applied to cache reads at $0.50/M, that would use very few quota credits per read, pushing most reads into extra-usage territory.\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- [GitHub #22435](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/22435) — Inconsistent quota burn rates, opaque billing formula\n- [GitHub #24727](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/24727) — Max 20x user charged extra usage while dashboard showed 73% quota used\n- [GitHub #24335](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/24335) — Usage tracking discrepancies\n\n## How to Audit Your Own Usage\n\nI built [attnroute](https://github.com/jeranaias/attnroute), a Claude Code hook with a BurnRate plugin that scans your local JSONL files and computes exactly this kind of audit. Install it and run the billing audit:\n\n```bash\npip install attnroute\n```\n\n```python\nfrom attnroute.plugins.burnrate import BurnRatePlugin\n\nplugin = BurnRatePlugin()\naudit = plugin.get_billing_audit(days=14)\nprint(plugin.format_billing_audit(audit))\n```\n\nThis gives you a full breakdown: all four token types with percentages, cost at published API rates, a \"what if cache reads are billed at creation rate\" scenario, and a daily breakdown with cache read percentages. Compare the published-rate total against your billing dashboard — if your dashboard charges are closer to the flat-rate scenario than the published-rate estimate, you're likely seeing the same issue.\n\nattnroute also does real-time rate limit tracking (5h sliding window with burn rate and ETA), per-project/per-model cost attribution, and full historical usage reports. It's the billing visibility that should be built into Claude Code.\n\n---\n\n**Edit**: I'm not claiming fraud. This could be an intentional billing model where all input tokens are treated uniformly, a system bug, or something I'm misunderstanding about how cache tiers work internally. But the published pricing creates a clear expectation that cache reads cost $0.50/M (90% cheaper than input), and Max plan users appear to be paying $6.25/M. Whether intentional or not, that's a **12.5x gap on 95% of your tokens** that needs to be explained publicly.\n\n**If you're a Max plan user with extra usage charges**, I'd recommend:\n1. Install [attnroute](https://github.com/jeranaias/attnroute) and run `get_billing_audit()` to audit your own token usage against published rates\n2. Contact Anthropic support with your findings — reference that their docs say extra usage is billed at \"standard API rates\" which should include the $0.50/M cache read rate\n3. File a billing dispute if your numbers show the same pattern\n\n\n(Tip:Just have claude run the audit for you with attnroute burnrate plugin.)\n\n\n**UPDATE 2: v0.6.1 — Full cache tier breakdown**\n\nSeveral commenters pointed out that 5-min and 1-hr cache writes have different rates ($6.25/M vs $10/M). Fair point — I updated the audit tool to break these out individually. Here are my numbers with tier-aware pricing:\n\n| Token Type | Tokens | % of Total | Rate | Cost |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Input | 118,593 | 0.03% | $5.00/M | $0.59 |\n| Output | 179,282 | 0.04% | $25.00/M | $4.48 |\n| Cache write (5m) | 14,564,479 | 3.64% | $6.25/M | $91.03 |\n| Cache write (1h) | 5,669,448 | 1.42% | $10.00/M | $56.69 |\n| **Cache reads** | **379,926,152** | **94.87%** | **$0.50/M** | **$189.96** |\n| **TOTAL** | **400,457,954** | | | **$342.76** |\n\nMy cache writes split 72% 5-min / 28% 1-hr. Even with the more expensive 1-hr write rate factored in, the published-rate total is **$342.76**.\n\n**The issue was never about write tiers.** Cache writes are 5% of my tokens. Cache *reads* are 95%. The question is simple: are those 380M cache read tokens being billed at $0.50/M (published rate) or ~$6.25/M (creation rate)? Because **$343 and $2,506 are very different numbers**, and my dashboard is a lot closer to the second one.\n\nUpdate your audit tool and verify yourself:\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade attnroute\n```\n\n```python\nfrom attnroute.plugins.burnrate import BurnRatePlugin\np = BurnRatePlugin()\nprint(p.format_billing_audit(p.get_billing_audit()))\n```\n\nCompare your \"published rate\" number against your actual billing dashboard. That's the whole point.\n",

That’s roughly a third of your total token volume running for free, which points to batch API credits, a free tier, cached responses, or a billing anomaly worth investigating.\n\nFeb 11 is the most expensive single day at $703.41, and it’s also the day with the fewest API calls (72) and fewest tokens (5.6M). That yields an extraordinary cost of ~$125 per million tokens, which is roughly 17× the corrected average.\nOverall spending is volatile — you swing from $0 to $703 across the ten days with no clear upward or downward trend.\n\nNon-Obvious Insights\n\n“Charges” and “API Calls” measure very different things, and their disconnect tells a story. Feb 6 made 936 API calls but generated 0 charges; Feb 11 made only 72 API calls but generated 53 charges. This likely means you’re mixing different products, models, or pricing tiers — and “Charges” represents discrete billable line items, not a 1:1 mapping to requests.\n\nFeb 11’s $125/M rate isn’t just expensive — it signals a fundamentally different workload. At standard Anthropic API pricing, even the most expensive model (Opus-class output tokens) wouldn’t easily reach $125/M in a blended rate unless you had an extremely output-heavy workload, were using a premium service like fine-tuning, image generation, or were hitting some other premium pricing tier. It’s worth auditing what specifically ran that day.\n\nFeb 5 through Feb 7 form a suspicious cluster. Token volumes spike dramatically (54M → 99M → 27M) while cost collapses ($96 → $0 → $0). This pattern is consistent with a batch job or evaluation run that exhausted a credit balance partway through Feb 5, ran on free credits through Feb 6–7, and then resumed paid billing on Feb 8. Alternatively, something shifted in your pricing arrangement during that window.\n\nYour cost efficiency has a bimodal distribution, not a normal one. You essentially have “cheap” days ($1.77–$7.55/M) and “expensive” days ($12–$125/M), with very little in between. This suggests two distinct usage modes — possibly high-volume batch processing with smaller/cached models on cheap days, and low-volume interactive or premium-model usage on expensive days. Understanding which mode drives value for you could meaningfully reduce your bill.\n\nWeekend vs. weekday patterns are suggestive. Feb 8–9 (Saturday–Sunday) saw high activity and moderate cost, while the surrounding weekdays are more erratic. If automated jobs run on a schedule, the weekend consistency vs. weekday volatility might indicate that human-initiated usage (weekdays) is what’s driving cost unpredictability.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

They come directly from the API response usage object — these are server-side counts returned by Anthropic's API. There's no client-side counting happening. What my JSONL records is what the server reported.\n\n  2. That jq command would miss 99% of the tokens. input\\_tokens + output\\_tokens ignores cache\\_creation\\_input\\_tokens and cache\\_read\\_input\\_tokens, which together are 99.6% of all tokens in Claude Code. That's the whole point of the post.\n\n  3. \"Cached tokens show as reduced cost but full input tokens in the JSONL\" is backwards. The JSONL explicitly separates them into distinct fields: input\\_tokens, cache\\_creation\\_input\\_tokens, and cache\\_read\\_input\\_tokens. They don't get lumped together. My audit reads all four token type fields separately and applies the published rate for each. Cache reads are clearly labeled as cache reads — the question is whether they're billed at $0.50/M as published or $6.25/M as my dashboard suggests.\n\n\n\n  claude export isn't a command, either.",

The reason cache reads are so high is because of how Claude Code works within a single conversation: every time you send a message, it re-sends your entire conversation history and system context to the API. On the second turn and beyond, most of that is already in cache from the previous turn, so it gets served as a cache read instead of a fresh input. By the time you're 20+ turns into a session, 95%+ of every request is cache reads. That's actually the system working as intended — the problem is whether those reads are being billed at $0.50/M (as published) or $6.25/M (as my data suggests).",

To get visibility on what's actually being charged, scripts like yours and attnroute are pretty much necessary right now since the dashboard alone isn't granular enough. One thing that might help push Anthropic for more transparency: aggregate findings from other Max plan users, it's hard for support teams to ignore repeatable audits showing the real costs. If you've got friends or colleagues using similar setups, benchmark together and share results publicly (with privacy, of course). Developers posting consistent patterns is often how SaaS vendors actually address these issues.\n\nOutside of the specific Claude/Anthropic ecosystem, if you're doing outbound lead gen or anything that racks up lots of API calls and costs, you might also want to look at platforms that automate top of funnel tasks to keep costs predictable. I can share that as a founder of [salespire.io](http://salespire.io), we've started a waiting list for early users, aiming to address exactly this type of ops and budgeting headache by letting AI digital agents handle sales outreach workflows without the unpredictable token costs or massive engineering overhead. It's still early, but if your team deals with a lot of programmatic outreach or wants to control spend better, it might be relevant.\n\nKeep sharing your findings, deep dives like this are super valuable for everyone navigating unclear SaaS billing!",

      "text": "I'm a solo dev vibecoder. For months I had this setup: plan features in ChatGPT, generate audit prompts, paste them into Claude Code to review the whole codebase, send Claude's analysis back to ChatGPT in AI-friendly format, ChatGPT generates actionable prompts with reports, send those back to Claude to execute.\n\nThis workflow was working really well, I shipped 4 production apps that generate revenue using exactly this loop. But then I got exhausted. The process takes days. ChatGPT chats get bloated and start hanging. Copy-pasting between two AI windows all day is soul-crushing.\n\nSo I switched to Codex CLI since it has direct codebase context. Started preparing .md files using Claude Code, then letting Codex review them. It worked, but I kept thinking. I can automate this.\n\nThen the idea hit me.\n\nWhat if Claude Code could just call Codex directly from the terminal? No middleman. No copy-paste. They just talk to each other.\n\nI built the bridge. Claude Code started running codex commands in the shell and they instantly worked like partners. Efficiency went through the roof, they detected more bugs together than either did alone. I brainstormed a name in 3 minutes, wrote out the architecture, defined the technical requirements, then let both AIs take control of the ship. They grinded for 2 straight days. The initial version was terrible. Bugs everywhere, crashes in the command prompt, broken outputs. But then it got on track. I started dogfooding CodeMoot with CodeMoot using the tool to improve itself. It evolved. Today I use it across multiple projects.\n\nHow it works now:\n\nBoth AIs explore the whole codebase, suggest findings, debate each other, plan and execute. Then Codex reviews the implementation, sends insights back to Claude Code, and the loop continues until we score at least 9/10 or hit the minimum threshold.\n\nThis is the new way of working with AI. It's not about using one model, opinions from multiple AI models produce better, cleaner code.\n\nTry it (2 minutes):\n\nYou need claude-code and codex installed and working.\n\n\\# Install\n\nnpm install -g u/codemoot/cli\n\n\\# Run in any project directory:\n\ncodemoot start          # checks prerequisites, creates config\n\ncodemoot install-skills # installs /debate, /build, /codex-review slash commands into Claude Code\n\nThat's it. No API keysuses your existing subscriptions. Everything local, $0 extra cost.\n\n\n\nFurther I have added various tools inside it which i actively use in mine other projects and also for the codemoot itself:\n\n\n\nWhat you get: (use it in claudecode)\n\nTerminal commands (run directly):\n\ncodemoot review src/                         # GPT reviews your code\n\ncodemoot review --prompt \"find security bugs\" # GPT explores your codebase\n\ncodemoot review --diff HEAD\\~3..HEAD          # Review recent commits\n\ncodemoot fix src/                            # Auto-fix loop until clean\n\ncodemoot cleanup . --scope security          # AI slop scanner (16 OWASP patterns)\n\ncodemoot debate start \"REST vs GraphQL?\"     # Multi-round Claude vs GPT debate\n\n\n\nSlash commands inside Claude Code (after install-skills):\n\n/codex-review src/auth.ts    — Quick GPT second opinion\n\n/debate \"monorepo vs polyrepo?\" — Claude and GPT debate it out\n\n/build \"add user auth\"       — Full pipeline: debate → plan → implement → GPT review → fix\n\n/cleanup                     — Both AIs scan independently, debate disagreements\n\n\n\nThe meta part: Every feature in CodeMoot was built using CodeMoot itself. Claude writes code, GPT reviews it, they debate architecture, and the tool improves itself.  \n\n\nWhat I'm looking for:\n\n \\- Does npm install -g u/codemoot/cli + codemoot start work on your setup?\n\n \\- Is the review output actually useful on your project?\n\n \\- What commands would you add?\n\nContributors are welcomed, suggestions are respected and feedbacks are appreciated its made for vibecoders and power users of claude code for free what other companies dont provide.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/katarmal-ram/codemoot](https://github.com/katarmal-ram/codemoot)\n\nOpen source, MIT.

When you're bouncing analysis back and forth, each model interprets the previous output through its own lens. Small misunderstandings compound across hops.\n\nSome patterns that help:\n- **Structured handoffs** - Use JSON or YAML for inter-agent communication instead of prose. Less ambiguity.\n- **Single source of truth** - Keep the codebase state in one place. Agents read from it, write decisions back, but don't rely on conversational memory across models.\n- **Explicit contracts** - Define what each agent is responsible for (e.g., ChatGPT = planning, Claude = execution). When responsibilities overlap, you get circular reasoning.\n\nAlso curious: how do you handle cases where Claude's analysis contradicts ChatGPT's plan? Does one model have veto power, or do you resolve it manually?",

Reduces the telephone game effect. The handoffs are already somewhat structured review findings come back as JSON with severity, file, line, message fields rather than freeform prose. So Claude isn't interpreting vibes, it's reading structured data. As for contradictions right now it's manual. If GPT's review disagrees with something Claude did, it surfaces the findings and you decide. I've been thinking about adding a tiebreaker round where both models see each other's reasoning and have to converge, but haven't shipped that yet. The debate command is the closest thing it runs actual back-and-forth rounds between them until you're satisfied.\n\nGood questions though, this is exactly the kind of stuff I'm iterating on.",

You don't need to prompt each step.\n\nI should probably record a demo honestly I'll put one together this week. In the meantime if you install it (npm install -g u/codemoot/cli) and have Codex CLI set up, codemoot init + codemoot review is the fastest way to see it work.

The CLI integration approach makes a lot of sense - keeps the full power of Claude Code's tool ecosystem while adding workflow automation.\n\nOne thing I've found helpful in similar setups: spawning agents with --agent flag + --append-system-prompt for task context preserves the frontmatter config (model selection, tool restrictions) better than passing raw system prompts. Lets you have role-specific agents (coder, reviewer, etc.) with different capabilities.\n\nAlso worth considering: background task support with output files, so you can kick off long-running agents and continue working rather than blocking on completion.",

The 9/10 scoring threshold is smart - gives the AIs a concrete goal instead of endless refinement. For teams using this: consider adding a \"confidence threshold\" flag so it stops when both models agree with high certainty, not just when the score hits 9/10. Sometimes consensus at 7/10 is actually good enough and saves compute cycles.",

That \"fast\" iteration actually cost me hours.\n\nWith mine new approach: Claude writes code ->GPT catches bugs on first review -> they debate edge cases I wouldn't have thought of -> I get cleaner code in fewer total iterations.\n\nSo per-iteration it's slower, but total time to production-ready code is way less. Especially for security stuff  GPT catches things Claude misses and vice versa. The real win isn't speed per iteration, it's fewer iterations overall.

Issue Watcher: a script running in the background that periodically scans for GitHub issues marked as ready. For each one, it spawns a dedicated tmux session with a Claude Code (or Codex) agent that works on it autonomously in an isolated git worktree. It follows my custom skills/prompts. When done, it opens a PR.\n\n2. PR Watcher: a second watcher picks up open PRs and monitors them for CI failures, merge conflicts, and review comments from me. When something needs attention, it spins up another agent to address it. When the PR is merged, it cleans up the worktree and exits.\n\n\nFrom my phone, the entire workflow is just:\n- Create a GitHub issue describing what I want\n- Review the PR when it shows up\n- Leave comments if something needs changing\n- Merge when I’m happy\n\nI’ve been using it for a while and I’m pretty satisfied with the results",

Then I break that down into a comprehensive list of tasks, having agents review the tasks and PRD to check I will get what I want.

      "text": "[Google Chrome 145](https://developer.chrome.com/release-notes/145) just shipped an experimental feature called [WebMCP](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/webmcp-epp).\n\nIt's probably one of the *biggest deals* of early 2026 that's been buried in the details.\n\nWebMCP basically lets websites **register tools that AI agents can discover and call directly**, instead of taking screenshots and parsing pixels.\n\nLess tooling, more precision.\n\nAI agents tools like [agent-browser](https://jpcaparas.medium.com/give-your-coding-agent-browser-superpowers-with-agent-browser-ae3df40ff579) currently browse by rendering pages, taking screenshots, sending them to vision models, deciding what to click, and repeating. Every single interaction. 51% of web traffic is already bots doing exactly this (per Imperva's latest report).\n\nEdit: I should clarify that agent-browser doesn't need to take screenshots by default but when it has to, it will (assuming the model that's steering it has a vision LLM).\n\nHalf the internet, just... screenshotting.\n\nWebMCP flips the model. Websites declare their capabilities with structured tools that agents can invoke directly, no pixel-reading required. Same shift fintech went through when Open Banking replaced screen-scraping with APIs.\n\nThe spec's still a W3C Community Group Draft with a number of open issues, **but Chrome's backing it and it's designed for progressive enhancement.**\n\nYou can add it to existing forms *with a couple of HTML attributes.*\n\nI wrote up how it works, which browsers are racing to solve the same problem differently, and when developers should start caring.\n\n[ https://extended.reading.sh/webmcp ](https://extended.reading.sh/webmcp)",

I started by using chrome to show the task, but this creates a bunch of application focus problems; like if you close the task window, any other chromes you have open inherit focus, so you end up flipping between windows constantly which is really irritating. Running a python instance gives you way more flexibility with things like dismissing the task or autoclosing it on completion, but i think the final form will be a tauri or electrion app that lives in your tray- I think that'll make setup easier and provide the most reliable api for creating flexible tasks.",
