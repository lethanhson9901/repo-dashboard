I have notified Google but I recommend others do aswell.\n\n---\n\n\n# Security Analysis Report: \"Lock\" Adblock Extension\n\n#  VERDICT: MALICIOUS - DO NOT USE\n\n  This extension is a trojanized version of uBlock Origin Lite with malicious code injected.\n\n  ---\n#  Critical Findings  \n\n# 1. Hidden Iframe Injection (MALWARE)\n\n\n`js/scripting-manager.js:171` registers a universal content script `(id: \"loading-script\")` on matches: `[\"<all_urls>\"]` that\n    injects `js/spin.js` into pages.\n\n`js/background.js:79` stores an install/update timestamp `(chrome.storage.local.set({ i: ... }))` and `js/background.js:84` sends\n    it to every tab on load completion `(chrome.tabs.sendMessage(... { action: \"i\", data: res.i } ...)).`\n\n`js/spin.js:136` receives that message and, after ~8 hours, injects a hidden sandboxed iframe that loads a third-party URL:\n\n`js/spin.js:151` sets `loaderSpinner.src = \"//loader\" + \".\" + \"media/loading\"`, with sandbox flags allow-top-navigation allow-\n    same-origin allow-scripts `(js/spin.js:149).`\n\nThis causes outbound requests to loader.media from pages you visit, leaking at least your IP/User-Agent and typically\n        the full page URL via the Referer header (i.e., browsing history exfiltration). allow-top-navigation also enables the\n        iframe content to navigate the top page (redirect risk).\n\n  Location: `js/cs.js:12700-12706`\n`  loaderSpinner.src = \"//object\" + \".\" + \"center/centre\";`\n  - Triggers immediately on every page load\n  - Injects hidden iframe to object.center\n\n#  2.

Don't expect cloud Claude levels of intelligence out of other models especially local models that you can run, and don't expect good intelligence from ollama created models\n\n\nDo yourself a favor and ditch ollama. You'll get better performance with llamacpp and have better control over model selection and quants. Don't go below q6 if your watching it and q8 if your gonna let it rock. \n\n\n\nNon anthropic and non openai models will need to be explicitly told what to do and how to do it and where to find something. Claude and GPT are extremely good at interpreting what you meant and filling in the blanks. They are also really good at breaking down tasks. You will need to get extremely verbose and get really good at prompt engineering and context management. Don't compact and if you change something in context clear it and start fresh \n\n\nEdit -\n\n\nClaude is really good at helping you build good initial prompts for local models. It's why I kept Claude but lowered it to the $20 plan and might ditch it entirely ",

I'm not a dev, I do work in IT though, I can spell python, and that's about it.  I've been using CC for a few weeks and I'm pretty impressed.  \n\nI think a lot of times the discussions in here are very similar to the discussions that happen in the gamedev subs.  It's like the culture shifts, and the whole gamedev sub becomes centered around high speed turnover on low effort projects and everyone is looking for some niche and hopefully one of their thousand shitty games will sell.  They get lost of the weeds of the grind and completely forget that typically in life, making a quality product is successful, not making a thousand shitty products and hoping one of them takes off.\n\nIn here its like all these software devs will flap their jowls about how shitty a job CC does, or that an experienced dev will be able to utilize these tools where a novice will just create a spaghetti mess.  Idk man, kinda feels like the same argument as the gamedev stuff but in a different wrapper.  The product I've been able to produce over the last couple weeks, the level of polish, and the auditing capabilities of it just seems so powerful.  It doesn't matter if it's not the perfect Sr Dev codebase honestly.  If you have ever worked in any kind of corporate environment you know it's impossible to deliver perfect products because money, politics, whatever douchebag with a grudge gets involved and things get convoluted and messy.  Maybe I'm not seeing it, but I don't see how this is that much different?  Sure it's not perfect code, but I promise you I'm going to produce a useful product.  It's pretty impressive.\n\nI've yet to look into Cowork, I might look into it when I get this project finished.",

I’ve been a software engineer for over 30 years and I have been using Claude code for a couple months. My suspicion is that when people complain about Claude not working well it is because they aren’t doing the work upfront to ensure that Claude follows their quality standards and their operating procedures. If you get the scaffolding right, and the Claude.md files right, and you manage the context window properly, Claude code is astounding. I haven’t been this excited about what I can accomplish since the days of Web 2.0.",

Ive been diagnosed ADHD and this was like executive function collaboration that helped me achieve things so quickly that I would have never had the patience or time to execute on my own.

The desktop app doesn’t have the coding system prompts, so there’s an element of pattern matching/blinkers that the DT Claude doesn’t have that CC does. \n\nI’m sure you can create a similar vanilla CC that then runs CC agents with the coding system prompt.

Eliminating Waterfalls (CRITICAL)\nasync-defer-await - Move await into branches where actually used\nasync-parallel - Use Promise.all() for independent operations\nasync-dependencies - Use better-all for partial dependencies\nasync-api-routes - Start promises early, await late in API routes\nasync-suspense-boundaries - Use Suspense to stream content\n2. Bundle Size Optimization (CRITICAL)\nbundle-barrel-imports - Import directly, avoid barrel files\nbundle-dynamic-imports - Use next/dynamic for heavy components\nbundle-defer-third-party - Load analytics/logging after hydration\nbundle-conditional - Load modules only when feature is activated\nbundle-preload - Preload on hover/focus for perceived speed\n3. Server-Side Performance (HIGH)\nserver-cache-react - Use React.cache() for per-request deduplication\nserver-cache-lru - Use LRU cache for cross-request caching\nserver-serialization - Minimize data passed to client components\nserver-parallel-fetching - Restructure components to parallelize fetches\nserver-after-nonblocking - Use after() for non-blocking operations\n4. Client-Side Data Fetching (MEDIUM-HIGH)\nclient-swr-dedup - Use SWR for automatic request deduplication\nclient-event-listeners - Deduplicate global event listeners\n5. Re-render Optimization (MEDIUM)\nrerender-defer-reads - Don't subscribe to state only used in callbacks\nrerender-memo - Extract expensive work into memoized components\nrerender-dependencies - Use primitive dependencies in effects\nrerender-derived-state - Subscribe to derived booleans, not raw values\nrerender-functional-setstate - Use functional setState for stable callbacks\nrerender-lazy-state-init - Pass function to useState for expensive values\nrerender-transitions - Use startTransition for non-urgent updates\n6. Rendering Performance (MEDIUM)\nrendering-animate-svg-wrapper - Animate div wrapper, not SVG element\nrendering-content-visibility - Use content-visibility for long lists\nrendering-hoist-jsx - Extract static JSX outside components\nrendering-svg-precision - Reduce SVG coordinate precision\nrendering-hydration-no-flicker - Use inline script for client-only data\nrendering-activity - Use Activity component for show/hide\nrendering-conditional-render - Use ternary, not && for conditionals\n7.

Time for an update.\n\n[https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done)\n\n# The Big Changes\n\n**Multi-agent orchestration that actually works.**\n\nWhen I first posted, execution was single-threaded. Now the system spawns specialized agents in parallel — 4 researchers investigating your domain simultaneously, multiple executors building different parts of your codebase at once, a dedicated verifier checking if the code actually achieves what you asked for.\n\nThe absolutely bonkers part is that your main context window stays at 30-40% even after deep research or thousands of lines of code getting written. All heavy lifting happens consistently in fresh 200k subagent contexts.\n\n**Plans get verified before they run.**\n\nI got tired of watching Claude write plans that missed requirements or had broken dependencies. Now there's a planner → checker → revise loop. Plans don't execute until they pass verification. If the checker finds issues, the planner fixes them automatically.\n\n**Automatic debugging when things break.**\n\nThe new `/gsd:verify-work` command walks you through testing what got built. \"Can you log in?\" Yes/no. If something's broken, it spawns debug agents to find the root cause, creates fix plans, verifies those plans, and hands you a ready-to-execute solution. You don't debug — you just run `/gsd:execute-phase` again.\n\n**The discuss-phase breakthrough.**\n\nThis is the best update I reckon. Before planning, you now feed your preferences into the system — how you want the UI laid out, what the error messages should say, how the CLI flags should work. That context flows into research (so it investigates the right patterns) and planning (so it builds what you actually want, not reasonable defaults).\n\n# Meta Building\n\nThe system builds itself. Every GSD improvement gets planned and executed using GSD. It's the most meta thing I've ever worked on and it just keeps getting better.\n\n# The Philosophy Hasn't Changed\n\nI still don't want to cosplay as an enterprise team. I still just want to describe what I want and have it built correctly.\n\nThe difference now is the system is *so much smarter* about how it does that. Research before planning. Verification before execution. Debugging when things break. Fresh context for every heavy operation.\n\nIt's not magic. It's just really good context engineering wrapped in a workflow that doesn't get in your way.\n\n    npx get-shit-done-cc\n\nWith love,\n\nLex\n\n**P.S.** Once you've downloaded the newest version, you can simply run `/gsd:update` to get the latest. The update command now shows you what changed and asks before installing — no more mystery upgrades.",

          "text": "Here's some extra context for those who are bound to ask \"yeah but what is it?\"\n\nClaude has \\~200k tokens of context. At 10% usage it's sharp. At 50%+ quality tanks—hallucinations, forgotten constraints, drift. One long conversation building a real project = inevitable degradation.\n\n**The fix: Orchestrator + Fresh Subagents**\n\nInstead of one conversation doing everything, GSD splits it:\n\n\\- **Orchestrator** uses \\~10-15% context. Reads plan metadata, coordinates, spawns workers, collects results. Never executes code itself.\n\n\\- **Subagents** each get fresh 200k context. Load one plan, execute its tasks, commit, write summary, die. Plan 5 has identical quality to Plan 1.\n\n**Wave-based parallelism**\n\nPlans get pre-assigned wave numbers during planning:\n\nWave 1: \\[plan-01, plan-02, plan-03\\] → 3 agents in parallel\n\nWave 2: \\[plan-04, plan-05\\] → 2 agents in parallel (waits for wave 1)\n\nWave 3: \\[plan-06\\] → 1 agent\n\nSame wave = no dependencies = parallelize. Higher wave = may depend on earlier = wait. A 6-plan phase runs in 3 rounds instead of 6.\n\n**Files as long-term memory**\n\nClaude has no memory between sessions. GSD uses disk:\n\n\\- \\`PROJECT.md\\` — vision/constraints (stable reference)\n\n\\- \\`STATE.md\\` — current position, decisions, blockers (instant resumption after /clear)\n\n\\- \\`PLAN.md\\` — executable task specs (not docs—actual prompts subagents execute)\n\n\\- \\`SUMMARY.md\\` — what was built (per plan)\n\n\\- \\`VERIFICATION.md\\` — proof the goal was achieved\n\nFirst step of every workflow reads STATE.md. Context restored instantly.\n\n**Goal-backward verification**\n\nTask completion ≠ goal achievement. Tasks can be \"done\" but deliver stubs.\n\nGSD works backwards from the phase goal:\n\n1. What must be TRUE for \"users can chat in real-time\"?\n2. What artifacts must EXIST? (Chat.tsx, /api/chat, Message schema)\n3. Are they WIRED? (Component actually calls API? API actually queries DB?)\n4. Are they SUBSTANTIVE? (Real code, not TODO comments or empty returns)\n\nCatches orphaned files, missing integrations, stub implementations.\n\n**Atomic git history**\n\nEach task = one commit. \\`git bisect\\` finds the exact failing task. \\`git revert\\` undoes one change cleanly. Future Claude sessions read history for context.\n\n\\---\n\n**TL;DR:** Fresh subagents prevent context rot. Parallel waves speed execution. Files on disk = persistent memory. Goal-backward verification catches \"done but broken.\" Atomic commits make everything reversible.",

Started with a Brown field PoC-grade eBPF Firewall which Had no UI nor API to configure it.\nI generated an UI using Google aistudio, then initialized the Project, did the Research and everything. It went smoothly throghout - it was able to connect most things. Its really impressive given, that it runs mostly unattended, and that there are no stub Implementations as you see them often.\nI ran with Opus throghout, and let it cook for 2-3 hours, occasionally  hitting enter / approving after the plan/requirements phase where i put more effort into building the roadmap. It churned through ~60 USD worth of API cost which seems reasonable given the background research, and everything.\n\nEspecially the planning for several milestones ahead was useful, now i got a roadmap and can continue after stabiliting the first milestone.\n\nI noticed one Gap where I'm not sure If this is my problem or should be fixes in the system/agent prompt:\n\n1. The plan / execution didn't produce ANY Tests - Not for the API, nor for the UI, and not for the glue between the API and the eBPF world. No integration or e2e Tests.\n\n\nI implicitly assumed, that tests are part of each milestones/phase/wave andnthat there's no need to explicitly add that as a requirement.\n\nThat said, it may be worth experimenting with the verification step: e.g. asking the user If he wants to create unit/integration tests before moving on.\nI feel that this is the point where one should verify that all the pieces are integrated nicely.",

Multi-agent coordination without automated validation\n\n\n\n  These are markdown specification files, not code. There's no compiler catching when gsd-planner says \"DISCOVERY.md\" but gsd-phase-researcher writes \"RESEARCH.md\". Unlike code with tests, spec drift goes unnoticed until runtime.\n\n\n\n  2. Rapid iteration\n\n\n\n  The GSD system has many moving parts (planner, executor, researcher, synthesizer, checker, debugger, etc.) that evolved over time. New features get added to one agent without updating all the others that depend on it.\n\n\n\n  3. Copy-paste with incomplete updates\n\n\n\n  Most bugs followed this pattern:\n\n  \\- ${PHASE} vs ${PADDED\\_PHASE} - copied code, missed variable rename\n\n  \\- XX-name placeholders - copied from template, never made concrete\n\n  \\- human-action for auth gates - reused existing type instead of defining new one\n\n\n\n  4. No single source of truth\n\n\n\n  File naming conventions, checkpoint types, and path patterns are defined inline in each agent rather than in a shared reference. When something changes, you have to find-and-replace across 10+ files.\n\n\n\n  Potential improvements:\n\n  \\- Shared constants file that agents reference (file patterns, checkpoint types)\n\n  \\- Cross-agent validation script that checks producer/consumer contracts\n\n  \\- Integration tests that verify agent A's output matches agent B's expected input",

I was working on a project and was wondering if GSD could help make other models \"smarter\" at the executing. I think it is doing so, but the experiment is still ongoing.\n\nBasically my current experiment started with me taking my existing code and duplicating it across 3 folders. One folder for Claude Code using Claude models. A second folder for using Claude Code using GLM. A third folder as the starting point just so I can easily diff the files to see how they have changed over time (and being able to compare this side by side).\n\nI've found that GLM is going a lot faster because I'm not running out of context window (I only have a Pro level plan for Anthropic). Not sure if GLM is smarter or dumber, but being able to just throw more tokens at it without being forced to stop is making progress a lot faster. I also find that I'm more comfortable doing more verifying and discussing via GSD for the GLM, whereas for the Claude models I have to make a judgement call to determine if it is worth the usage. I once burned through my 5 hour usage in 7 minutes on the Claude side while the GLM side just kept on running for 54 minutes until it was done (I hit 20% of my 5 hour limit in that instance, the most I've burned up at once).",

That is more friction than the first scenario, which means 1) fewer people will switch 2) people will be (on average) slower to switch. \n\nThere’s your “business perspective”.",

This is also why I don't waste time/energy triaging the 1,238,563 plugins/skills that are shared every day on Reddit, X, etc. There is far too much noise/AI slop around.

So I don’t really get much the ‘skill’ sentiment and the magic of it I am hearing here and there. Yes, skill plug-in might come up with examples too. For other things like Stripe integration it might actually learn correct APIs etc. but for frontend design it’s more like “DONT FUCK IT UP WITH PURPLE COLOR.”",

Would be curious what folks here think.\n\nThe main difference is it's visual. You get an n8n style canvas where features are nodes that turn Grey (pending), Red (failing), or Green (passing). So you can see your whole project state at a glance instead of reading through text.\n\nThe other thing I focused on is debugging data. When tests fail, TDAD captures what I call a \"Golden Packet\" with actual runtime traces: API requests and responses, DOM snapshots, screenshots, console logs with source locations. The idea is the AI gets a \"crime scene photo\" instead of just the test output.\n\nIt enforces Plan → Gherkin Spec → Test → Code. The AI writes BDD specs first, then tests before implementation. Currently it uses Playwright for both API and UI testing. \n\nIt's free, open source and runs 100% locally. No API calls, works with whatever AI you already use.\n\nSearch \"TDAD\" in VS Code or Cursor marketplace if you want to try it.\n\n[https://link.tdad.ai/githublink](https://link.tdad.ai/githublink)\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ylidmxwq1ueg1.gif\n\nIf anyone here has been using Superpowers and wants to give TDAD a spin, I'd genuinely appreciate hearing how they compare. Still iterating on this and real world feedback is invaluable.",

We need to talk about **Opus 4.5**—specifically the absolute legend of a model that existed back in December 2025.\n\nDo you remember December? Because I do. Back then, Opus didn't just \"complete tasks.\" It **one-shotted** my entire existence. I’d throw a complex, multi-layered architectural coding problem at it, and it would solve it before I even finished my sip of coffee. It was like having a precognitive genius living in my terminal. It was bold. It was brilliant. It was... *alive.*\n\nFast forward to today, and interacting with Opus feels a bit different. To be honest, it feels like I’m talking to an Amazon Alexa that has developed a sudden, deep existential crisis.\n\nIf I ask a complex question now, instead of that glorious \"one-shot\" victory, I get the digital equivalent of:\n\n>\"I'm sorry, the weather is a chaotic system influenced by millions of variables and is fundamentally unpredictable. Perhaps you should appreciate the clouds as they are?\"\n\nI don't want a philosophical debate about the unpredictability of rain; I just want to know if I need a jacket! My high-performance AI partner has gone from \"Solving World Hunger\" to \"I'm not sure I'm allowed to have an opinion on sandwiches.\"\n\nPlease, check the back of the server room. Is there a \"December 2025\" toggle switch that accidentally got bumped to \"Vague & Hesitant\" mode? Can we bring back the version that had the confidence of a thousand scholars and the efficiency of a speed-runner?\n\nI miss my \"one-shot\" king. Help me put the *Opus* back in *Magnum Opus*.\n\nWith love and a very outdated weather report,\n\ndomsen <3\n\n\\*thanks gemini for helping out writing letters to anthropic",

Simple tasks started taking 4-10x times longer, because of all the failed attempts and time wasted demutilating the mutilation of existing code. Claude became a wrecking ball mid-December.\n\nProviders are all doing parameter sweeps trying to minimize resource use and optimize for good enough. Some times you get the local minima and sometimes you get the local maxima of the parameter combinations.\n\nI switched to GPT 5.2 when  CC Opus 4.5 started getting so erratic and unproductive, but people are saying the same thing about GPT 5.2 now. I'm seeing it as well. Efficiency is dropping. Quality is decreasing.\n\nI'm guess it's both field testing for the Goldielocks settings and quite likely as signups or usage flows from today's SotA to the next. The data centers are spread thin and corners are cut to make the VRAM and tensor cores go as far as possible. When Opus 4.7 comes out, and we all scramble to get in on the best of the best, it will get stretched out to the point of being ruined again. And early adopters will remember the good ol' days when \"4.7 and I used to make magic happen.\" And then switch to GPT 5.5 or Gemini 4.0 and ruin those shiny new SotA services as well.\n\nHopefully, as more data centers come online, this will smooth out. But it makes working hellish now as we're running with scissors across quick sand trying to get work done.\n\nI'm planning on switching to mostly local LLM for implementation. It's nowhere near as good, but at least I control the resources and parameters, so it's consistent day to day and my workflows are stable. The frontier models can continue to plan and do reviews. Though even those have been inconsistent at best.",

      "text": "A funny side effect of AI-assisted coding is that it seems to fit inattentive ADHD brains unusually well.\n\nThese brains are often bad at linear recall and memorization, but very good at pattern recognition, big-picture thinking, and creative problem solving. They also rely heavily on external context because internal state tends to get dropped. Forgetting isn’t a bug, it’s the default mode.\n\nWhich is basically how LLMs work.\n\nAI tools like Claude Code don’t “remember” things either. They need exact context every time. They think in patterns, not facts. They generate plausible structure and then need verification. In other words, they operate in a way inattentive ADHD brains have been compensating for their entire lives.\n\nThe real win isn’t that they write code. It’s that they externalize working memory and collapse activation cost. Reading a codebase, summarizing architecture, drafting tests, proposing refactors, updating docs all become cheap first passes instead of momentum killers.\n\nHallucinations aren’t surprising here. They’re familiar. You handle them the same way: verify, test, correct, repeat. Treat the output as untrusted and it works fine.\n\nSo it’s kind of ironic. A lot of people struggle with AI because it “forgets things” or “needs constant context.” Meanwhile, some neurodivergent brains are like: yes, welcome to how this has always worked.\n\nNot AI replacing engineers. Just a tool that finally speaks fluent pattern-thinking.",

Deep dives, tangents, pattern jumps, sudden connections. Normally, context switching kills momentum and drains me fast. With AI, I can bounce between ideas, explore them deeply, and externalize the chaos instead of trying to hold it all in my head.\n\nIt feels like I finally have somewhere to put the thoughts. I can dump everything out, explore aggressively, then decide what’s actually worth pulling back into my internal context. That part is huge. It’s freeing. It unlocks creativity as opposed to shutting it down.\n\nAI matches my operating system. For coding, brainstorming, strategizing, planning, learning, building. \n\nI get to operate on extreme mode “systems thinking” and bottom up processing (especially when I use speech-to-text in my flow).\n\nMultiple things running at once, moving forward without getting stuck in friction. Micro-friction has blocked me from doing so much more than I could have in the past.\n\nIt’s not replacing judgment. Im using my good judgment far more frequently. Very opinionated and particular. So It’s giving me space to use it without exhaustion. \n\nHonestly, it just works.",

Now I'm using my own governance remote mcp server / project board that serves as record of decisions and \"memory\" of sorts for architectural decisions across every project.  \n  \nI began to realize how I could \"parking lot\" ideas more easily if I managed my own context the same way.

The ideas here aren’t novel because of prose style, they’re about a cognitive pattern that’s been discussed in neuroscience and software engineering long before LLMs existed.\n\nAlso, there’s a category error in assuming that “AI-generated” means “unexamined.” The whole argument is explicitly about separating **generation** from **judgment**. Using a tool to help structure or phrase an idea doesn’t remove the need to reason about it any more than using a formatter removes the need to understand code.\n\nIf the content is wrong, incomplete, or misleading, that’s worth criticizing. But dismissing it purely based on how it was written is just avoiding the substance of the argument.\n\nIronically, that’s the same mistake people make when they evaluate AI-written code by vibes instead of by tests.\n\nIf you don’t want to engage with the idea, that’s fine.

I don't say, build me a SaaS that does all the things - I break things down like I would if I were tasking an engineering team - usually atomic features with specific focus that can be done in about 10-15 mins of claude chunking.",

On larger code bases it's definitely better to give more detail, referencing places in the code rather than giving broader strokes. It's a least more efficient that way. But, it will only be a matter of time before even large code bases can be kept in context. I could also imagine a shift to a language and style that is no longer really human readable and is just meant to use as little context as possible. There will always be industries that will be slower to change, but it's a matter of time, even if it's a decade or 3. That's always been the nature of programming, shifting to languages, tools and frameworks that make it easier.",

It has built in dangerous command detection, and it's own host of helpful features. Now ccode doesn't delete files it shouldn't AND I'm notified about it, never gets the cwd wrong, and it never fucks up file path syntax or shell context. (Trying to use unix commands in a powershell-type shell)\n\nI noticed problems with frontend code generation, so I took some time to create and iteratively refine a svelte-frontend implementation subagent. That, coupled with a janitor and code-reviewer subagents, and I don't have problems with frontend code generation anymore.\n\nDoes the model's working quality seem to degrade over time after release? Yes. But given some TLC and finesse, that degradation has proven to be completely mitigated.. at least for my own use cases. And I use ccode in production software development every single day.",

I'm always updating Claude Code there when there is a new version notification and I still didn't have it. THEN, I went to check Claude Code version and it failed, because in my other machine I had it installed using brew, and the machine I saw the new feature was using npm.\n\nThan I thought, okay, npm might have newer versions than brew, and I came home that day and re-installed using NPM.\n\nYes, after installing it via NPM, it became DUMB, bad javascript influence? I don't know. I got tired and I decided to check, and I re-installed today with brew, and BOYS???? He's back!\n\n  \nNow of course, this does not make any sense, I supposedly now that it is the same code being bundled for different package managers, BUT, if server has \n\n    if (model == 'opus' && package_manager == 'NPM' && peak_hours == true) {\n       callHaiku5BetaTest();    \n    }\n\nThis would explain a LOT. \n\nI'm aware I have 99.9999% chance I'm saying bullshit, but you can try, maybe I just didn't use it enough to see it get dumb again. 5h\\~ working as expected and counting.",

(The changes in the context / peompt seemed entirely unrelated)\n\n—-\n\nSo my mental model now is:\n\nThe models are justnot reliable or trustworthy, and there is no magic prompt that will make them follow all the instructions / constraints, because as soon as you get it to follow one constraint it will randomly start ignoring others (because any random change in the prompt could lead to random ignoring of constraints it was following before)\n\nTherefore, you have to micromanage to get reasonable results.\n\n—-\n\nI think the reason why people think it “gets worse” is because of \n- Random variations,\n- As they get deeper into a project details matter more and there are more constraints. (Whereas in the beginning it’s just rough prototyping with few constraints which the models are better at)\n\nI also noticed there was a big wave of “it’s dumber now” posts a certain period of time after the karpathy post started insane hype for Opus 4.5. I think it’s because a lot of people got into new projects over the winter holidays and were hyped initially, but at a certain point they got deeper into the project and it all started falling apart. Because lots of people went through this same arc at roughly the same time, the “it’s getting dumber” narrative started gaining massive traction in social media (I was a part of that)",

I just spend a lot of my day with half my screen monitoring my Claude Code interns for each project/deliverable, making decisions when needed, connecting an occasional API to let the thing make better decisions without me, and discussing how to optimize its outputs to save me even more time.\n\nThe 5x is an absurd value if you do any kind of white-collar knowledge work. I'd pay for the x20 and I'll probably have to at some point. I'm also paying for a few APIs I've connected to CC to make it better at the tasks I need (using something like gemini 2.5 pro for exploration as an agent saves an insane amount of context and it costs very little even under heavy usage).\n\nIf you take a look at usage tracking plugins, you'll see Anthropic is subsidizing the hell out of these plans for power users.

This took around 10% of my weekly usage, so I can infer codex on auto can run for around 600 minutes per week on a medium sized repo.\n\nI then paid for the £18 Claude plan and ran the exact same task on opus - it hit a 5 hour limit within around 10 minutes on my way to work (without completing the task) and so I immediately refunded through the help bot.\n\nLater, I refined the task spec after seeing where it was tripping up, and codex succeeded in 30 mins, using 6% of my quota.\n\nSo while I can't tell which model codex selected in each case, it completed a task in 1h30 using 16% of my quota - this was a notably difficult problem mind you, other requests are often under 10 min. Opus locked me out for 5 hours without completing the task, so for me the real productivity difference on the cheap plans appears quite large.",

Shouldn't be a surprise that sometimes compacting is required, which eats 10% of usage BUT that's not what this conversation is about. We're talking about the intentionally misleading usage limits, that are CONSTANTLY changing and remember, it was only supposed to be the top 5% of users abusing limits. If I charged you a monthly subscription for food and started to mess with quantity and quantity, all while gaslighting you and telling you that you must not have any cooking skills if you can't make it work. Hope that provides a smidge more clarity for yah",
