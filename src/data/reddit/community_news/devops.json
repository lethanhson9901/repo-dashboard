I collected all that plus other questions that I found on glassdoor, blind etc in a github repo. I've added my own video explanations to solve those questions. \n\nit's free and I hope this will help you to prepare and pass.

Audit logs got the 12-month retention or whatever they required.

Datadog might be expensive but they are really good at breaking down where your spend is. From there you should be able to figure out what’s producing more logs or metrics than what you need. We had a lot of “custom metrics” for instance that seemed really neat when we set them up but cost waaay more than they were useful. Nixed that. In one case our mobile team was logging everything that was unnecessary because they didn’t understand observability.",

A few things that helped us reduce log costs significantly:\n\n1. **Structured logging levels by environment** - Debug/trace logs only in dev, never in prod. Sounds obvious but we found dozens of verbose logging statements that shipped to production.\n\n2. **Sample high-volume logs** - For requests/jobs that run thousands of times per hour, log 1% with full detail, rest with just errors. We hash the request ID and sample deterministically so you can still trace a specific request if needed.\n\n3. **Pre-filter before shipping** - We run a lightweight log processor on the app server that drops known noise (health checks, bot requests, etc.) before sending to our log aggregator. Cuts volume by ~40%.\n\n4. **Retention tiers** - Hot logs (7 days) in fast storage, warm logs (30 days) in cheaper storage, cold logs (90+ days) in S3/GCS with Athena/BigQuery for occasional queries.\n\nWhat's your current stack? The optimization approach varies a lot depending on whether you're using CloudWatch, Datadog, Splunk, etc.",

That second vendor charges per GB ingested, per host, per custom metric, per span. Your app grows, logs grow with it, and that bill scales independantly from the value youre actually getting. Thats why storage ends up costing more than the servers.\n\nFew things that helped me\n\nSelf hosting your observability stack (Grafana + Loki + Prometheus, or SigNoz as an all in one Datadog replacement) saves a ton but now youre babysitting more services. Worth it if you have the bandwith.\n\nSwitching to a platform that bundles observability into compute cost was the bigger win for me. I moved to Quave ONE and the built in Grafana dashboards, ingress metrics grouped by path/status/response time, app logs with search and WAF logs just come included. No agents, no collectors, no seperate bill. Covers like 80% of what I was paying Datadog for. Railway and Render have some built in metrics too and Coolify is solid if you want full self hosting on your own VPS.\n\nIf youre staying on Datadog/New Relic at least look at Grafana Cloud, free tier is surprisingly generous (50GB logs, 10k series) and paid is way cheaper per GB. Also ask your vendor about committed use discounts, most people dont and leave money on the table.\n\nThe logging hygene advice everyone else gave is real but if your setup is structurally designed to charge you twice for everything no amount of sampling fixes the underlying problem.",

That isn't security, those are just glorified sysadmins spinning up software, throwing the results at other departments and not generating any benefit/value for the company (either because they are incompetent, or because management decided to get a bunch of junior level knowledge people; you get what you pay for).\n\n> I'm supposed to drop whatever sprint work I'm on, research the CVE, find where we use that package, assess actual risk, test the upgrade, and hope nothing breaks.\n\nI'm mostly with you here, security team should definitely have provided a list of impacted applications/modules/libraries, checked if the CVE is even potentially relevant (e.g. affects LDAP but it is known the application doesn't use LDAP), provided an initial impact or risk assessment (which then transfers to \"what priority does this ticket even have\"), scope, potential mitigations aside from \"update the dependency\". Also may need to translate CVE speak into developer speak. \n\nActual risk is then decided together with the developers since they know the application logic and dependency usage, while we (security) can provide details on the vulnerability.\n\nEach company and applications are different, but for me it is very rare for a CVE to be \"this is urgent enough to need to be taken care of today\" with no alternative temporary mitigations available to reduce the risk.\n\n> Why can't these tools give actual context? Like this package is used in auth flow, vulnerability allows account takeover, here's how to fix it. Instead of just screaming CVE numbers at me.\n\nSounds like the tool they are using is working with a software bill of materials and not the code itself (e.g. DependencyTrack). Or the software technically could do it as part of the Software Composition Analysis, but the feature is locked behind a higher cost tier that what they are paying (e.g. Sobarqube). Again you get what you pay for.\n\nAs a bare minimum I'd suggest your manager pushes for the the security team to include the full CVSS scoring, an impact analysis written by the security team in the context of the business, and for the security team to implement a proper ASPM to generate actional tasks and not just CVE checkboxes.",

That's an important distinct, risk needs to be treated, not fix.\n\nFixing code and determining what's relevant or not for the application isn't security's job, they don't have the skills set. I've seen senior security guys that can't read a git diff. On the web mind you, not on the CLI. So asking devs to go to mitre or just google with the CVE identifier isn't unreasonable, it's a decent identifier that will give you all the info you need to fix (again, assuming it's not outputting all issues without priority).\n\n  \nMain bit: the tool is just one part of the solution. Still needs exception, documentation, reporting. It's not about fixing everything, it's about surfacing and treating risk.",

The security team is not technical and doesn't understand our system at all so are incapable of actually triaging issues. For a while we were even told we cannot have any vulnerabilities of any severity on anything. Thankfully there was such a massive uproar to the stupidity of that request that they changed it to no critical or highs. Which is still a stupid policy because it's a blanket rule without any context or assessment into actual risk to any of our actual products.\n\n\nI honestly don't know what happened, but it used to be more reasonable where you'd assess risk and then if it was determined there was no real risk. You just had to write a quick little justification. Send it off to the security team and they would approve exemptions. Now. They seem to refuse to approve any exemptions no matter what for any reason. \n\nI brought this up with my manager about how much of a massive waste of time this is and how it's completely insane and crippling us. I was told that they understand and they agree but that it's out of their hands. It's coming from a much higher level. I was literally told that it does not matter what the cost or consequences are. We have to meet the requirement even if it breaks things.

I've had to talk to my coworkers just about the jira hell they create.\n\n\nTooling matters a lot here and I think has improved a lot over the years. We generally do like a 2 week evaluation of testing tools before buying them, and I do a pretty deep dive on quality of automated triage.\n\n\nMy main tool is Semgrep Pro. It includes pretty good reachability analysis and the sast severity errs on the side of not being too sensationalist. Can highly recommend it vs the other tools I've evaluated. Automated tickets are created for anything that's reachable above high severity, and the tooling does a good job with it. I review all tickets before assigning them to a team, and have a Slack bot that informe me or every new vuln.\nThe reachability analysis requires zero setup, but it will miss things and can't evaluate every eco system / package whatever. Every ticket includes the tool summary description, a link back to the security tool, and the commit that introduced the issue.\n\n\nOn the infrastructure security side, both Wiz and Orca seem to do a good job at context and ranking issues, but are expensive.

They said use npm audit. npm audit only catches KNOWN vulnerabilities.

It blocks stuff like curl | bash in lifecycle hooks ,Reading process.env and making HTTP calls ,Obfuscated eval() calls and Binary files where they shouldn't be and many more\n\nWorks fine. Caught the fake package. Also flagged two legitimate packages (torch and tensorflow) because they download binaries during install, but whatever just whitelist those.\n\nMy manager thinks I'm wasting time. \"Just use Snyk\" he says.

          "text": "We mitigate this risk by having a Director of Security willing to constantly update us about the latest and greatest in ransomware attack vectors of all types, and by actually doing a bit of checking on new external libraries before including them. We're essentially looking for red flags in the maintenance history for the project or sometimes in the code itself. Humans are imperfect humans but the ones following best practices are less likely to become the weak leak leading to distribution of an exploit. We aren't at this time code-reviewing or running any static-code-analysis on these libraries, although it's not a terrible idea in principle. We have other things on the radar targeting this risk, like going all in on devcontainers so untrusted code is isolated in a container on the developer workstation, and getting in place a separate internal package registry for production along with a process for vetting and promoting specific builds of dependencies.\n\nThat, and good backups. Immutable backups, specifically. The thing you hope you'll never need, but will allow you to tell ransomware perpetrators to fuck off while rebuilding infrastructure from IaC and loading backups.\n\nWhether what you're doing is \"wasting time\" depends on the security stance in your organization which is up to technical leadership. Do the perceived risk of not using this outweigh the cost of maintaining it? Does the organization have the collective expertise to maintain an internal security scanning tool vs getting the best available existing coverage off the shelf? Security decisions are rarely black/white, but mitigation of security risk is a task that truly has no \"completed\" state so the business has to decide what is \"enough\".",

Since I put devsecops on my CV suddenly not getting no interviews. I Thought the fact I brought security skills would help get me hired because my CV IS 90% devops 10% security but for someone reason no roles which I’m not used to.\n\nI would like to ask any devops leads firstly what are you looking when hiring right now (my experience multi cloud, terraform, docker, kubernetes, helm, GitHub argoCD, python, Prometheus, ELK stack, CKAncert) obviously to go into what I done with these would be long but what are you guys looking at when you look at CVs?\n\nSecondly don’t think the devsecops is harming my CV?\n\nThanks ",

          "text": "Hiring should typically pick up in a few months. I don’t think putting devsecops on your resume necessarily hurts unless you’re making that your main focus and roles hardly mention anything security related on them. \n\nCloud skills will always be the most glaringly relevant thing most folks look at first(aws, gcloud or azure experience) since majority of the time you’ll be working in one of those three. Although there are some companies that still host their own hardware and run k8s. \n\nI personally prefer someone with a relatively short resume. Where the initial summary and past few jobs aligns with skills we’re looking for in our job posting. \n\nThats enough to get a phone screen anyways. The phone screen is really the “important” part to getting further in the process since it’s easy to weed out if your resume is fluff or not. \n\nObviously having a prior connection that works on the team and would recommend you is by far the best route…I don’t think I’ve seen a scenario the candidate didn’t make it through and it’s how I’ve been hired and have hired former coworkers. (Assuming the connection worked with them for a decent amount of time and highly recommends them, not a hand wavey, they were decent type remark)\n\nSome companies are also just bad at taking down “ghost postings” where that position has been filled already yet they send the generic “not a fit for us” email anyways.\n\nLastly I will add…soft/social skills matter now more than ever. You can check the box on all the skills and experience need but another canidiate might have a bit less experience or hasn’t worked exactly in the same stack we are. 9/10 we’re still gonna hire the person who doesn’t seem like an asshole to work with and knows how to communicate effectively, especially if it’s a remote position. \n\nI get the vibe from a lot of postings recently that just having the skills and experience is enough. Maybe for some places where you’re just a cog in the wheel but how you interact is heavily judged and accounted for. When i show up to work it’s enojyable to work with peers who are not only smart but dont come off abrasive/condescending or just straight up rude. Id rather hire a junior i can train up then a senior with that personality imo. (Not saying this is you just in general)",

I ran through that carousel.\n\n  \nOne thing that bothered me the most were companies that without warning - would put me in a coding challenge.  Sure, it's expected.  It's part of the job.  But lately? They're giving me SDE level challenges.  Hash tables are one thing, but linked lists? Binary Search? The last interview I had my jaw dropped.  It was painfully difficult. They wanted me to solve a problem involving ping pong balls in a room of x size.  I was floored.  Second challenge - fix a kubernetes manifest issue.  Easy peasy in my book.  No problem.  But oh, what's this? the configmap has a python script thats... 300 lines long? And it's broken? So now I have to debug and fix it as well? All this in 15 mins? Oh, look here.  It's using a redis package.  Great, I haven't touched the redis package in months.  A lot of these methods called are vaguely familiar and some i've never used.  Can I look at the official docs? No? Why not? Oh, because in the real world, engineers don't consult docs on the internet.  Sorry. My bad. \n\n  \nAbsolute insanity.  At one point I just started laughing mid interview. I knew I was cooked.  When I had a call with the recruiter after, he was insanely apologetic.  I told him to put a note down that any other candidate going through these interviews should basically be an SWE.  My way of giving the next person a massive heads up.\n\nI had to do double takes and re-read the job descriptions. Amazingly, the job descriptions all involved: IaC, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Observability, Scaling Systems, Reliability engineering... you know.. Devops stuff.  \n\nI wonder - is this becoming the norm now? Are the skills I have just misaligned and not really DevOps? Interviews like this make me feel like a fraud, tbh.  It's like all the experience I have building infrastructure, scaling systems, writing operators, hammering away at terraform means nothing to these companies.  They just want a SWE that does infra.\n\n",

You get a few simple tasks tackling different areas (cli tooling, ansible, terraform, docker, troubleshooting, etc). You are given unlimited resources, including ChatGPT. You are doing it all ssh'd into a VM. You just have to share your screen while you do it. I generally know if someone is going to do well in the first 30 seconds. \n\nThe methods are intentionally left wide open. If you want to write Python to pull some fields out of a json api, that's fine. If you want to curl | jq, that's also fine. The test is designed to replicate tasks that you would normally do in the creation and maintenance of infrastructure. It is also designed to cause you headaches if you don't know tooling or can't do a simple google search. \n\nThe test is about how you approach a problem and can you quickly acquire the knowledge to solve it if you don't already possess it. How you reference docs, how you google search, how you prompt LLMs reveals just about all I need to know about you. It is wild to me how many people assume the shape of data and never once actually look at it. \n\nActual senior engineers plow through my interview in under 20 minutes. Less senior, but competent will usually finish in the allotted hour. People that have no idea what they are doing, usually try to grep json, unformatted, and get stuck for 30 minutes completing a two minute task.",

Theres maybe 3-4 other engineers that routinely write PHP code. I have nobody to turn to for guidance on DevOps and good software practices are non-existent so any standards I have are self imposed. \n\nOn the positive end it's very low stress environment. So even though i'm not expected to do things right I still want to do perform well cause it's valuable experience for the future.\n\nHowever I'm really confused on the path moving forwards. It seems like the \"tech tree\" of skill progression in programming is more straightforeard, whereas in DevOps i'm just collecting competency in various tooling and configuration formats that don't overlap as much as the things a progammer needs to know.\n\nATM i'm trying to set up a CI/CD pipeline with local github actions (LAN restrictions prevent deployment from github) while reading a book about linux.

Juniors bring new perspectives which are key to organizational success. \n\nThere are major cultural components to devops as well as technical. The cultural piece actually sounds easier than normal, in your case, given the size of your teams. \n\nSomeone posted the road map already. Start there as your technical path to implement. Along the way, read and learn why each of those pieces are necessary. That's where you then begin making the cases to your teams about why you need to do these things, and how to shape the culture to get them done. \n\nOne good thing about devops is that it is very closely tied to the open source world, meaning there's a lot of documentation on everything, and very large user communities to learn specifics from. \n\nGiven your autonomy in your role, you have a fantastic opportunities to really build a strong system without the legacy burdens most other organizations have. You get to do it all here, which will make you a far more effective engineer than most commenting here. Don't let their jaded comments dissuade you.",

Someone can do that when thinking solely about the above, but that usually means missing the big picture of context, which means you get solutions that aren't always matching up with a developer wants or needs.\n\nA junior devops turned into devops in my experience often turns into \"not my problem, here is a log that is 99% filled with nothing related, parse that log and fix it\" type of interaction. A developer turned devops turns into \"I saw this issue, I think it's this from the log, I suspect I can fix it on my end doing x/y, but it would likely be better if y'all did z instead\". That's also someone developers then appreciate and are willing to compromise with much faster, because the developers trust that person to have taken their side into account and how it fits into the big picture.\n\nAnd yes, to fufil that kind of role is hard, that's why good devops people are paid very well. They are both rare, and took a very long time to get to that point in their skills.",

          "text": "I learned it basically as a vocation. I've been a computer nerd since the age of 5. Started a web hosting biz in high school, which exposed me to enterprise grade infrastructure. With the experience I already had, I was hired as the IT director of the independent student newspaper in college for all 4 years (a legit business, with half a million $ revenue each year and 100 business and editorial staff in the office between 9am - 4am, 5 days per week). I had free reign to do whatever improvements I wanted to the infrastructure - workstations and servers/network/storage - that I wanted, as long as the systems were up and healthy. So that was basically my personal lab to experiment with and learn.\n\nI worked as a systems engineer after graduation, gradually working on larger systems in a datacenter. I learned a ton about infrastructure, which I really enjoy because systems engineering is basically about making all the different pieces of infra work together , and build a system that does things.\n\nI taught myself to program as a kid and honed my skills throughout college and after. I got my foot in the door as a devops engineer at my 3rd professional job and started with some crappy AWS systems that me and my teammate slowly built out using best practices and terraform. Thats how I learned about infra automation and deployment pipelines. \n\nIn summary, I learn best by working on projects, which involve making multiple different parts work together. Code is the glue that ties everything together and automates it. I hate classroom learning because it is boring. Project work gives me great satisfaction because I have an end creation that works and does things, that I can feel proud of.\n\nI have taught some of my friends how to transition to devops/SRE work, by assigning them this project:\n\n* Sign up for a free AWS account.\n* Write a simple software service in your language of choice. Maybe a python flask application that serves a simple user signup and login form and an API with /user and /auth endpoints. Then create 2 microservices  to handle user creation (CRUD - create, read, update, delete) and login (validates username and password , responds with either a token or a 403 permission error) . Use mysql as your datastore; create an appropriate database schema.\n* Containerize each of those 3 applications with Docker/containerd by writing a simple dockerfile in the code root of each, and building the images\n* Set up a mysql/mariadb server and ECS cluster or EKS cluster in the AWS console. Use the smallest instance type. You get a very limited free budget each month from AWS and costs can quickly balloon, so terminate them when you arent working on your project and re-provision when you do. Write this in terraform at some point, so that you get terraform experience. AI can be tremendously helpful and will show you how to do it. Dont just rely on the AI to do it for you, pay attention to what infra it wants to create and how the configs relate to one another\n* Write a bash script to copy the docker images you created to the ECS container repo and deploy them into the ECS or EKS cluster\n* Debug things until you are able to load your UI through your browser and the microservices work as intended. You will be able to see the data is getting stored in the database\n\nHave fun! 😅 I love this stuff and it is a great career that pays $$$$. As an SRE I am responsible for ensuring system performance and uptime, which means that being on-call is a fact of life. A software engineer can cost the company money with crappy/buggy/insecure code, but an SRE can cost a company millions of $$ and the company's reputation if they do a poor job. We get paid so much because we have a critical responsibility. Unfortunately it is a thankless job because when everything is working well, nobody cares that we exist. But when things dont work, the hammer comes down and the bosses are like \"why did you let this happen, why didnt you catch this sooner and fix it faster???\"",

Pick the thing that's causing you the most pain right now (deployments taking too long? config drift? no monitoring?) and fix that one thing properly. Then move to the next pain point. After a year of that you'll look back and realize you accidentally became competent.\n\nAlso, being the one-man show on a big campus is going to look incredible on your resume in 2-3 years.

The only thing you can do, is do it cheaper but that's highly variable and a lot like man vs machine.  This subreddit would disagree with me but the way tools and problems will be solved is changing drastically across the board.\n\nEssentially, you should understand MLOps, which is supporting models, config, launching, etc. however, you're going to use LLMs to troubleshoot and figure out solutions.  The only way around this is to lab, setup linux machines, have them talk to each other, host distributed systems, run kubernetes clusters, create issues, fix them, rinse repeat.\n\nI never labbed in a distributed env but I used Linux as a daily driver, which is full of enough stuff to learn.  If you want the minimal input with the highest ROI then build out an arch linux daily driver and never look back.  I use Fedora because I just want stuff to work and it's a desktop version of RHEL, so the experience is pretty nice.  Arch forces you understand things better and make tradeoffs especially when installing fresh software.\n\nAll in all, devops is for the people who are too nerdy to stay in software engineering because of the politics but still want to write a lil code, write a lil config, monitor systems, etc.\n\nEdit: if anyone bashes you (no pun intended) then ask for their github.  At the end of the day DevOps engineers write software and should have something to show for that knowledge.  Take care!",

Start running vault for secrets. Take a look at the vault csi operator to get secrets into k8s resources or helm charts.\n\nMaybe take a look at gitops with something like FluxCD. Figure out how to do ingress (reminds me that I need to find an alternative to nginx ingress). Look into metallb for load balancing. Figure out how to work with persistent volumes.\n\nBasically just come up with stuff that would be useful to you in your home and figure out how to stick it on k8s.\n\nI bought a CKA course on Udemy and it was useless to me. I need to be solving problems that I'm interested in to absorb knowledge.\n\nAlso, check out k9s - beats the pants off kubectl for general usage.",

      "text": "Hey r/devops,\n\nRecently I finished a months long rewrite of the Locust K8s operator (Java → Go) and wanted to share with you since it is both relevant to the subreddit (CICD was one of the main reasons for this operator to exist in the first place) and also a huge milestone for the project. The performance gains were better than expected, but the migration path was way harder than I thought!\n\n# The Numbers\n\n**Before (Java/JVM):**\n\n* Memory: 256MB idle\n* Startup: \\~60s (JVM warmup) (optimisation could have been applied) \n* Image: 128MB (compressed)\n\n**After (Go):**\n\n* Memory: 64MB idle (4x reduction)\n* Startup: <1s (60x faster)\n* Image: 30-34MB (compressed)\n\n# Why The Rewrite\n\nHonestly, i could have kept working with Java. Nothing wrong with the language (this is not Java is trash kind of post)  and it is very stable specially for enterprise (the main environment where the operator runs). That being said, it became painful to support in terms of adding features and to keep the project up to date and patched. Migrating between framework and language versions got very demanding very quickly where i would need to spend sometimes up word of a week to get stuff to work again after a framework update.   \n  \nMoreover, adding new features became harder overtime because of some design & architectural directions I put in place early in the project. So a breaking change was needed anyway to allow the operator to keep growing and accommodate the new feature requests its users where kindly sharing with me. Thus, i decided to bite the bullet and rewrite the thing into Go. The operator was originally written in 2021 (open sourced in 2022) and my views on how to do architecture and cloud native designs have grown since then! \n\n# What Actually Mattered\n\nThe startup time was a win. In CI/CD pipelines, waiting a full minute for the operator to initialize before load tests could run was painful. Now it's instant. Of corse this assumes you want to deploy the operator with every pipeline run with a bit of \"cooldown\" in case several tests will run in a row. this enable the use of full elastic node groups in AWS EKS for example.\n\nThe memory reduction also matters in multi-tenant clusters where you're running multiple tests from multiple teams at the same time. That 4x drop adds up when you're paying for every MB.\n\n# What Was Harder Than Expected\n\n**Conversion webhooks for CRD API compatibility.** I needed to maintain v1 API support while adding v2 features. This is to help with the migration and enhance the user experience as much as possible. Bidirectional conversion (v1 ↔ v2) is brutal; you have to ensure no data loss in either direction (for the things that matter). This took longer than the actual operator rewrite.also to deal with the need cert manager was honestly a bit of a headache!\n\nIf you're planning API versioning in operators, seriously budget extra time for this.\n\n# What I Added in v2\n\nSince I was rewriting anyway, I threw in some features that were painful to add in the Java version and was in demand by the operator's users:\n\n* OpenTelemetry support (no more sidecar for metrics)\n* Proper K8s secret/env injection (stop hardcoding credentials)\n* Better resource cleanup when tests finish\n* Pod health monitoring with auto-recovery\n* Leader election for HA deployments\n* Fine-grained control over load generation pods\n\n# Quick Example\n\n    apiVersion: locust.io/v2\n    kind: LocustTest\n    metadata:\n      name: api-load-test\n    spec:\n      image: locustio/locust:2.31.8\n      testFiles:\n        configMapRef: my-test-scripts\n      master:\n        autostart: true\n      worker:\n        replicas: 10\n      env:\n        secretRefs:\n        - name: api-credentials\n      observability:\n        openTelemetry:\n          enabled: true\n          endpoint: \"http://otel-collector:4317\"\n\n# Install\n\n    helm repo add locust-k8s-operator https://abdelrhmanhamouda.github.io/locust-k8s-operator\n    helm install locust-operator locust-k8s-operator/locust-k8s-operator --version 2.1.1\n\n**Links:** [GitHub](https://github.com/AbdelrhmanHamouda/locust-k8s-operator) | [Docs](https://abdelrhmanhamouda.github.io/locust-k8s-operator/)\n\nAnyone else doing Java→Go operator rewrites?

The ones that exist cost a lot of money to unlock all the features. Security scanning? Enterprise tier. SSO? Enterprise tier. Replication? You guessed it. So I built my own.\n\nArtifact Keeper is a self-hosted, MIT-licensed artifact registry. 45+ package formats, built-in security scanning (Trivy + Grype + OpenSCAP), SSO, peer mesh replication, WASM plugins, Artifactory migration tooling — all included. No open-core bait-and-switch.\n\nWhat I really want from this post:\n\n\\- Tell me what drives you crazy about Artifactory, Nexus, Harbor, or whatever you're running\n\n\\- Tell me what you wish existed but doesn't\n\n\\- If something looks off or missing in Artifact Keeper, open an issue or start a discussion\n\nGitHub Discussions: [https://github.com/artifact-keeper/artifact-keeper/discussions](https://github.com/artifact-keeper/artifact-keeper/discussions)\n\nGitHub Issues: [https://github.com/artifact-keeper/artifact-keeper/issues](https://github.com/artifact-keeper/artifact-keeper/issues)\n\nYou don't have to submit a PR. You don't even have to try it. Just tell me what sucks about artifact management and I'll go build the fix.\n\nBut if you do want to try it:\n\n[https://artifactkeeper.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/](https://artifactkeeper.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/)\n\nDemo: [https://demo.artifactkeeper.com](https://demo.artifactkeeper.com)\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/artifact-keeper](https://github.com/artifact-keeper)",

Each node manage its own sync queue with per-peer concurrency limits and exponential backoff. You can set sync windows to push replication to off-peak hours. \n\nConsistency and conflict resolution: For the common case, artifacts at the same path use last-write-wins — same upload logic on both sides of a sync. For most package formats this works since you're not republishing the same version. Peer health is tracked via heartbeats, and the sync worker applies exponential backoff when a peer is unreachable. Actively working on improving a few things here around automatic peer recovery and task retries.\n\nStorage growth: 5 lifecycle policy types today — max age, max versions, no-downloads-after-N-days, tag pattern delete, and per-repo size quotas. Plus SHA-256 deduplication at ingest so the same content stored twice doesn't cost you twice. All policies have dry-run support so you can preview before anything gets deleted. A couple more policy types and smarter eviction are in the works.\n\nIf you've got specific replication scenarios that have burned you I'd genuinely love to hear them — that's exactly the feedback that shapes what gets built next.",

          "text": "Apple's DevOps interviews typically run 4-6 rounds and they're going to hit you hard on fundamentals - expect deep dives into infrastructure as code, CI/CD pipelines, containerization, monitoring, and incident response. They care a lot about how you think through problems and your ability to explain complex technical decisions in simple terms. The compensation is competitive with other FAANG companies, so for mid-level you're looking at 180-250K total comp, senior can push 300K+, and staff+ goes well beyond that. Don't overthink the \"Apple culture\" thing - just be genuine, show you can collaborate, and demonstrate that you understand production systems at scale. As for what not to say, avoid badmouthing previous employers and don't pretend to know something you don't - they'll catch you immediately.\n\nYou're going to make it further than you think if you focus on articulating your actual experience clearly rather than memorizing textbook answers. They want to see how you've solved real problems, not how well you can recite best practices. Talk about your failures and what you learned from them - that's actually valuable to interviewers. The technical bar is high but it's not impossible, and the fact that you got the interview means someone already thinks you have what it takes. If you want some help articulating your experience better during the actual interview, I built [AI Assistant](http://interviews.chat) to sell yourself more effectively when you're in the hot seat.",

Nobody would deploy a service and never review whether it's still needed, but somehow we all just let metrics and log pipelines accumulate forever.\n\nWhat actually worked for us was writing a simple script that queries the DD API for all custom metrics, then cross-references which ones appear in any dashboard or monitor. Anything orphaned goes on a list. We review it monthly and it takes maybe 20 minutes now. The first time we ran it we found over 40% of our custom metrics weren't referenced anywhere.\n\nThe other thing that saved us real money was being aggressive about log exclusion filters at the agent level. Health checks, readiness probes, noisy debug logs from third-party libraries — all of that was being indexed by default. Pushing those filters as close to the source as possible cut our log ingest bill in half without losing anything useful.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m a junior developer (around 1.5 years of experience). I was hired for a software developer role. I’m not some super strong 10x engineer or anything, but I get stuff done. I’ve worked with Python before, built features, written scripts, worked with Azure DevOps (not super in-depth, but enough to be functional).\n\nRecently though, I’ve been asked to work on Jenkins pipelines at my firm. This is my first time properly working on CI/CD at an enterprise level.\n\nThey’ve asked me to create a baked-in container and write a Jenkinsfile. I can read the existing code and mostly understand what’s happening, but when it comes to building something similar myself, I just get confused.\n\nIt’s enterprise-level infra, so there are tons of permission issues, access restrictions, random failures, etc. The original setup was done by someone who has left the company, and honestly no one in my team fully understands how everything is wired together. So I’m basically trying to reverse-engineer the whole thing.\n\nOn top of that, I’m also expected to work on Airflow DAGs to automate certain Python scripts. I’ve worked on Airflow before, but that setup was completely different — the DAG configs were already structured. Here, I have to build DAGs from scratch and everything feels scattered. I’m confused about database access, where connections are defined, how everything is deployed, etc.\n\nSo it’s Jenkins + baked containers + Airflow DAGs + infra + permissions… all at once.\n\nI’m constantly scared of breaking something or messing up pipelines that other teams rely on. I’m not that strong with Linux either, so that adds another layer of stress. I spend a lot of time staring at configs, feeling overwhelmed, and then I get so mentally drained that I don’t make much progress.\n\nThe environment itself isn’t toxic. No one is yelling at me. But internally I feel like I’m underperforming. I keep worrying that I’ll disappoint the people who trusted me when they hired me, and that they’ll think I was the wrong hire.\n\nHas anyone else been thrown into heavy CI/CD + infra work early in their career without proper documentation or mentorship?\n\nHow do you deal with the overwhelm and the fear of breaking things? And how do you stop feeling like you don’t belong?\n\nWould really appreciate any advice. 🙏",

Too many juniors/mids go straight to AI these days and don’t put in the hard miles, but it sounds like you have the right mindset. \n\nThe only thing I would say is be honest and tell your manager that you can’t juggle both things, the DAGs in Airflow AND working out the Jenkins setup is not achievable, unless given time. Even for a senior that would asking a lot. Just be honest, something I learnt through my career is it’s not a sign of weakness to admit you don’t know something. I find juniors and even mid level guys are terrified of this but I promise, no one is going to look down on you for not knowing. That’s our job to work things out, you just get a bit quicker at it once you’ve been in the game a while.

In reality though, no package manager means rewriting every Dockerfile from scratch or maintaining dual images like some amateur hour setup.\n\nDid my homework and found countless teams hitting the same brick wall. Pipelines that worked fine suddenly break because you cant install debugging tools, cant troubleshoot in production, cant do basic system tasks without a shell.\n\nThe problem is security team wants minimal images with no vulnerabilities but dev team needs to actually ship features without spending half their time babysitting Docker builds. We tried multi-stage builds where you use Ubuntu or Alpine for the build stage then copy to distroless for runtime but now our CI/CD takes forever and we rebuild constantly when base images update.\n\nAlso nobody talks about what happens when you need to actually debug something in prod. You cant exec into a distroless container and poke around. You cant install tools. You basically have to maintain a whole separate debug image just to troubleshoot.\n\nHow are you all actually solving this without it becoming a full-time job? Whats the workflow for keeping familiar build tools (apt, apk, curl, whatever) while still shipping lean secure runtime images? Is there tooling that helps manage this mess or is everyone just accepting the pain?\n\nRunning on AWS ECS. Security keeps flagging CVEs in our Ubuntu-based images but switching to distroless feels like trading one problem for ten others.\n\n",

I'm curious, the only time I know it could be helpful is when you have a memory leak only in the real environment.

I would say that, for the orgs I work with, both the answers here are the best answers:\n\n1. Ensure that you have usable telemetry that reduces your need to interactively troubleshoot.  \n\n2. Build out a pattern using \\`kubectl debug\\` and an image built with all the tools you might need to debug so that you're ready when a team can't figure it out from their telemetry.\n\nSaying that you should have such amazing telemetry that you never have to interactively debug is a great philosophical position; however, my sense is that most orgs will never justify the levels of overhead and storage that might be necessary to do that SO OVERWHELMINGLY that they'll never need to break glass and debug interactively.  Better to have the pattern available, not need it, and eventually deprecate it than to need it and not have it.\n\nThere's also, always:\n\n3. Just ram \\`bash\\` and other basic tools in your distroless image.\n\nI \\_don't\\_ advocate this but, sometimes, the politics of the situation are that getting teams to give up the ability to \\`kubectl exec\\` in is, sometimes, too big a reach to start with.

The decision really comes down to: **Do you value control or convenience?**\n\n**Prometheus → Datadog reasons:**\n- **Alert fatigue** - Prometheus alerting config is YAML hell. Datadog's UI makes complex alert logic (multiple conditions, anomaly detection, forecast alerts) way easier.\n- **Unified observability** - Having metrics + logs + traces in one platform simplifies correlation. With Prometheus you're stitching together 3-4 tools (Prom + Loki + Jaeger/Tempo).\n- **Managed infrastructure** - Not dealing with Prometheus HA, TSDB sizing, retention management. This matters more as you scale.\n- **Query language** - PromQL is powerful but cryptic. Datadog's query builder + saved views are more accessible for non-SRE teams.\n\n**Datadog → Prometheus reasons:**\n- **Cost explosion** - Datadog pricing scales brutally with custom metrics and log volume. We hit k/month and realized 70% was log ingest we didn't need.\n- **Vendor lock-in** - Moving off Datadog is painful (all dashboards/alerts need rebuilding). Prometheus + Grafana is portable.\n- **Control** - Prometheus + long-term storage (Thanos/Cortex/Mimir) gives you full data ownership and infinite retention if needed.\n- **Cardinality limits** - Datadog has strict limits on tag cardinality. Prometheus handles high-cardinality metrics better (until you hit storage issues).\n\nHybrid approach we ended up with: Prometheus for metrics (self-hosted with Mimir for long-term storage), Datadog for logs and APM only. Gets us cost control on metrics while keeping the log/trace convenience.",

First, it can be tough to live without a proper level of German anywhere outside of Berlin or Munich. Second - you now need to pass an exam to apply for permanent residence permit (AFAIR, since last year).\n2. I’m afraid you don’t consider the job seekers’ citizenship. Degrees are almost useless for doing the job, but required to get the visa and then the residence permit. When I moved here, I was already employed in another country but the company still issued formal letters for the immigration bodies explaining the need to hire people from abroad to issue the initial visa. Additionally, there are different types of residence permits, with different conditions.\n3. Not like degrees but yes, I barely look at them when I interview people and I don’t make hiring decisions based on their presence. This might be viewed differently in other companies though (mainly consultancies or outsourcing).\n4. Basically, yes… plus, there are many people who claim to be senior (sometimes even worked as seniors) but cannot explain the basic SDLC concepts. It got even worse with AI.\n5. It is possible but it’s important to understand that it requires additional efforts from the company. On the other side, there is a new type of visa now - Chancenkarte - but I don’t have experience with that one.",

For eg before genai , to become an expert , you needed to know your stuff really well but with gen ai now , i dont even know what it means to be an expert anymore. my question is i want to understand some of the challenges that cloud devops engineers are facing in their day to day when it comes to artifical intelligence.

The correctness audit is table stakes. The data exposure audit barely exists in most orgs.\n\nWe moved our infra-assist tooling to self-hosted models specifically for this reason. Open-source models on dedicated hardware handle Terraform and Ansible generation well enough for 90% of cases, and the security team stopped losing sleep over what was leaving the network.",

Same when I \"vibe-coded\" a fork of driftctl in Golang to swap out about 1/3 of the code.  I gave it a read-only role to ensure the changes I wanted (ripped out the individual service API calls with 1 call to AWS Config API to track config) works with an actual AWS account.\n\nIt makes me feel more like a Product Manager explaining what I want the code to do, and having a plan on how to test and falsify assumptions/hallucinations.",
