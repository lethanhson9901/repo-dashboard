A distroless image with 5 CVEs can be infinitely safer than a bloated base with \"clean\" scans that just haven't been discovered yet.\n\nWe're optimizing for the wrong metrics and burning out teams with noise.",

You now need to actually understand each test, it's dependancies and assumptions, and determine what the actual test should be.

          "text": "You are not alone; this is a common hurdle that every team hits eventually. A great deal of engineering goes into making automated web tests resilient for the exact reasons you are describing. While newer technology like Playwright would probably help and might be cheaper to implement than you’d expect, ultimately have to make the best of the tools you have right now. That is what you are doing. Good job reaching out for help!\n\nIt is okay if you don’t have the capacity to address the problem immediately, but since you need to move past \"rerun until green,\" I have a few troubleshooting suggestions:\n\n* Run the failing tests as many times as possible in a loop and track the results to identify exactly how often and when they fail.\n* Parallelize your debugging by making multiple copies of a single test with small variations in each, then run them for days to see which change actually stabilizes the result.\n* Break the tests down into the smallest units possible to reduce the \"surface area\" where a flake can occur.\n* Run the tests in both headless and headed modes; for headed tests, try dedicating a few old PCs with monitors so you can watch the execution in real-time.\n* Configure the tests to stay open after a failure; if you can get 20 browser windows open to the exact point of failure, it becomes much easier to spot inconsistencies.\n* Execute the suite across different screen resolutions and browsers to see if the failure is environment-specific.\n* Add configurations to take frequent screenshots throughout the test. Sometimes the resource tax of capturing an image changes execution just enough to \"fix\" a race condition, which is a massive clue in itself.\n\nYou might want to configure the test suite to rerun suspect tests and only fail the build if a specific threshold of failures is exceeded. A test that confirms even a single instance of success is still a useful test; if you aren't yet proving reliability, you are at least affirming correctness.  \n  \nMy guess your tests might benefit from waiting for something to load that you aren't currently checking for. It's also possible you are seeing race conditions, maybe a legitimate problem with your data state that simply doesn't surface in normal usage. Uncommon, unintended, or malevolent behavior can sometimes expose these issues, potentially leading to server-side inconsistencies that can turn ugly very quickly.\n\nLet us (me) know how if you learn anything and we can keep looking if needed. Good Luck!",

Whether it’s figuring out some obscure issue that happened overnight or performance debugging etc. curiosity and always wanting to find the root cause is what got me in this field to begin with. \n\nMentoring juniors is 50/50 I enjoy giving help but some there’s a few times where no matter the amount of help I give it just doesn’t translate. A bad analogy but the LeBron of coding can train someone daily and even if that someone is receptive to taking that advice or training, when they never utilize it. It feels like a lost cause. \n\nSmartest person in the room is subjective for me how big is the room and who’s in it. If it’s a small DevOps team then I really wouldn’t mind and would kind of expect it to happen at some point. A lot of ops/sre work ends up collaborating with backend/front end engineers or data engineers and I’m always learning on that front. \n\nFortunately have never worked somewhere or on a team where no one’s idea or thought was not recognized or considered.",

DevOps is about making the Devs aware of the products lifecycle, which include the deployment but not only.\n\nMaking them aware does not mean you don't need Ops anymore. That's an incorrect, yet understandable, confusion. Again, the Operational counterpart of Development does not exist, that's the infrastructure. \n\nUnless you use the cloud, you will have on-prem infrastructure and maintaining the infrastructure is the role the Ops. For example: upgrading the nodes of your VMWare cluster, replacing the hardware, creating MLAG to ensure redundant networks, ... that's the role of the Ops.\n\nIt's not replacing, it's making them work hand-in-hand.\n\n### DevOps and Project Management\n\nDevOps \"infinite loop\" finds its root in ITIL which also brought Agile and SCRUM. This cycle is iterative, like the sprints, opposed to the \"waterfall development\". Yet, nobody claims it's replacing project management.\n\n\n### DevOps job is an absurdity\n \nAt least that's my opinion. The DevOps job usually mean \"someone that uses devops tools\". So you can have DevOps hired in an infrastructure team. But DevOps isn't about the tools.\n\nYou can respect the mentality with handmade perl scripts and documentation if you want.\n\nIf I use a knife, I don't become a chief. Similarly, if a network engineer use ansible and a scheduled pipeline, they don't become a DevOps.\n\nA \"DevOps\" is just a developer who is aware of the product lifecycle. It makes no sense to name a job by your mentality and approach of the problem.\n\nWe don't give title like \"agressive saleperson\" or \"encourage collaboration manager\". Why make the work strategie of a developer their title then?\n\nNote: I have been at this position for years in the past in decently big companies. I only saw the DevOps job in chaotic work environment.",

My team has a KPI this year to reduce cloud spend by seven figures, largely on my assertions we could make it happen and by we I mean me.  Most of that will come from backporting architectural refinements onto application stacks that I don't own, but that the owners/teams aren't really capable of doing themselves due to resource and/or skill limitations.\n\nI find wasteful resource spending due to inefficiencies or just sloppy work to be professionally embarrassing and offensive.  It's not my money, it's technically not even my job responsibility, but \"FinOps\" is something of my own personal crusade and as luck would have it I've found upper management *really* appreciates when an email report they didn't even ask for comes in with some big dollar savings numbers.  Nothing says, \"put this guy at the top of the bonus list\", more than saving more than your own salary as a side hustle.  You know what doesn't impress the brass nearly as much?  Shaving 20ms off page response times, adding 0.01% to your uptime SLIs, or deploying 10% faster.\n\nWhat were we talking about again?",

However the job was \\*very\\* comfy and I allowed myself to settle into it -- a fatal error given that my entire team was laid off back in September during the government \"cost saving\" cuts.\n\nNot taking the time after work to make sure I was current anyway and up to date was in part entirely my fault and in part severe burnout of the industry.

I will likely need to work a much lower position in IT support (I'm completely out of money and lost my apartment already; Unemployment is not giving enough for cost of living here) and study evenings because I cannot pass an interview given the last several I've had going poorly; I simply do not have the necessary knowledge. I intend to re-certify as an AWS Solutions Architect Associate after letting it lapse, and may study for CKA as well.\n\nI am admittedly pretty against AI and have that going against me right now, so I'm trying to focus on other avenues.",

I don't know how passionate you are about the job, but for me this was got me through the hard days... instead of asking myself \"How to build this thing\" I always asked \"why does this thing exist, how does it work, who benefits, what are the tradeoffs etc\" - so a natural curiosity was always there for me.\n\nMap every pipeline & infra to OKRs + revenue. For ex: CI/CD isn't 'deploy fast', it's 'reduce MTTR by 50% to unblock sales team during outages'. What helps me have a broad view is having org/client alignment AND absolutely ruthless prioritization. I think if you track 3 months of \"why\" questions you'll see the game.",

Every one of them added a huge amount of JavaScript and dragged our Lighthouse score down. All we actually needed was a simple way for visitors to send a message and for us to reply quickly.\n\nSo I built a small custom chat widget myself. It is about 5KB, written in plain JavaScript, and runs on Cloudflare Workers using WebSockets. For the backend I used Discord, since our team already lives there. Each conversation becomes a thread and replies show up instantly for the visitor.\n\nOnce we switched, our performance score went back to 100 and the widget loads instantly. No third party scripts, no tracking, no SaaS dashboard, and no recurring fees. Support replies are actually faster because they come straight from Discord.\n\nI wrote a detailed breakdown of how it works and how I built it here if anyone is curious\n\nhttps://tasrieit.com/blog/building-custom-chat-widget-discord-cloudflare-workers\n\nGenuinely curious if others here have built their own replacements for common SaaS tools or if most people still prefer off the shelf solutions.",

That's about the closest case where I didn't use anything other than plain English to describe what I wanted to happen (connect to my Chrome browser where I have a saved profile logged into LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Indeed and search for specific jobs).\n\nThat's about the only \"no-code\" solution I can feasibly imagine where the LLM navigates the web page.  It's okay, but it's still subject to fabrication/hallucinations (e.g. it pointed me to 10 URLs to supposed job postings that didn't exist).  I'd peg it at about an 80% success rate, but I'd still need to verify the results.  That's generally why I would never trust AI to apply to jobs for me (because I would never trust it enough not to make up skills or experience I don't have).\n\n  \nOtherwise I'm not sure how browser automation can be \"no-code\".  LLMs are fine, but they're not deterministic.  For example, in one run of one workflow on one day, the results were 100% factually correct.  But then the exact same workflow executed against the same website on a different day with the same AI model had 100% fabricated results.  So LLMs can do more than scripts, but they're not as predictable or reliable.\n\nI'd probably just ask LLM to use Playwright to explore a site, do what I want, generate a script, then verify it manually.",

The reliable pattern for me has been exactly what you described, use AI to explore or draft, then lock it down into code or a very tightly scoped workflow that you can reason about and version.",

We also showed how may bug tickets were closed in the last sprint and a few other related metrics. We’d then send bi-weekly reports (same cadence as the sprints) to the entire engineering org. It was extremely effective. Name and shame can do wonders when used correctly.\n\nAt another company, when we’d do our ticket grooming sessions, any bugs older than 6 months would be closed. The owners could re-open if it was still an issue. The idea being that if the bug had existed unfixed for 6 months or more, it probably didn’t warrant to time of the team. The other factor was services changed often enough that many times it was no longer present after that long. Again, if it was still an issue it could be re-opened and re-opening would re-classify to a high priority ticket.",

Backlog items should be prioritised by customer and company impact, so that bugs which affect customers or impact the company (increase support load, make further software development hard, bring regulatory risk) are given higher priority along with features that benefit customers (easier to use, brings more customers in, etc) or benefit the company (decrease support load, enable better features in future, reduce regulatory risk).\n\nIf your product management is preferring some features over the things with most customer benefit, that's an upper management and product management problem.\n\nYou may want to create a list of bugs that have material customer impact, with the impact listed along each bug.

Determine its role in the company. (asset by asset or asset class, such as ***this*** server, ***these*** workstations) \n* Determine the process owners for those roles. \n* Work out with them maintenance and servicing schedules that accommodate ITs obligations and their resource needs.\n* Anything too critical to be reasonably patched required redundancy, anything too old to patch requires a timeline for replacement, and mitigation/control/monitoring.\n* Take what you learned and form it into policy\n* Follow the policy.\n\nYou can follow SSVC or create your own in its image, but if you are not patching on business need at the asset level vs criticality and timelines, then you are likely behind, and certainly working too hard.\n\nTom says \"IT rebooted my computer in the middle of a meeting!\"  \nIT says \"We were following policy\"  \nHR resolves, not IT.  \nGetting this done is almost always a policy/personnel constraint, not technical. \n\nAnd the gold star is once well defined, practiced, and tested. Just automate the policy and get the time back.\n\nSo while that specifically targets patching in a more traditional OS/Patch sense, the principals still apply. Risk is unknown or known. From there it is defined or undefined. From there it is actionable or documented/reviewed. Then it is all audited and it repeats.\n\nAnd that is how processes are born and how monthly questions go form \"What do we do with \\_\\_\\_\\_?\" and changes it to \"The policy says we do \\_\\_\\_\\_ with \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_!\"",

I thought of having just a single devcontainer with all things installed, but I also thought of having different devcontainers with different versions of things like older versions of powershell. \n\n  \nSo tell me, have to seen or done anything like this?

      "text": "Tempo has been a total headache lately. I’ve been staring at Spark traces in there for weeks now, and I’m honestly coming up empty.\n\nWhat I really want is simple: a clear picture of which Spark stages are actually driving up our costs.\n\nHere’s the thing… poorly optimized Spark jobs can quietly rack up massive bills on AWS. I’ve seen real-world cases where teams cut infrastructure costs by over 100x on critical pipelines just by pinpointing inefficiencies, and others achieve 10x faster runtimes with dramatically lower spend.\n\nWe’re aiming to tie stage-level resource usage directly to real AWS dollar figures, so we can rank priorities and tackle the biggest optimizations first. Right now, though, it just feels like we’re gathering traces with no real insight.\n\nI still can’t answer basic questions like:\n\n* Which stages are consuming the most CPU, memory, or disk I/O?\n* How do we accurately map that to actual spend on AWS?\n\nHere’s what I’ve tried :\n\n* Running the OTel Java agent and exporting to Tempo -> massive trace volume, but the spans don’t align meaningfully with Spark stages or resource usage. Feels like we’re tracing the wrong things entirely.\n* Spark UI -> perfect for one-off debugging, but not practical for ongoing cost analysis across production jobs.\n\nAt this point, I’m seriously questioning whether distributed tracing is even the right approach for cost attribution.\n\nWould we get further with metrics and Mimir instead? Or is there a smarter way to structure Spark traces in Tempo that actually enables proper cost breakdown?\n\nI’ve read all the docs, watched the talks, and even asked GPT, Claude, and Mistral for ideas… I’m still stuck.\n\nAny advice or experience here would be hugely appreciated,",

The trick is grabbing stage versus resource usage from Spark in a structured way and joining it to billing, not just dumping spans into Tempo and hoping for magic.\n\nTools that help correlate Spark stage metrics with AWS billing data without drowning you in span noise, including DataFlint, are worth a look here.",

Like I can troubleshoot production issues fine, that's not the problem, it's more about maintaining any sort of mental sharpness for 12+ hours straight while also not completely destroying my sleep schedule for the next week afterwards.\n\nBy hour 8 or 9 my brain just starts turning to mush, especially on those shifts where nothing's really breaking and I'm just sitting there monitoring dashboards waiting for alerts. Coffee stops helping around midday and just makes me feel jittery and kind of anxious which is obviously not ideal when you might need to make quick calls about prod systems. Energy drinks made me feel worse after the rush dropped.\n\nThe sleep thing is probably the bigger issue though? Because even if I time my caffeine right I still end up lying in bed at 2am completely wired even though I'm exhausted, then the next day I'm useless. Can't really nap during quiet periods either because my brain won't let me disconnect knowing I could get paged any second.\n\nJust curious what other people do for these situations because my current approach of drinking more coffee and hoping for the best is clearly not working lol. Not expecting some perfect solution, just wondering if anyone's found something that's at least better than what I'm doing now.",

Mainly because we’re a smaller environment and many of our AWS servers were lifted-and-shifted from on-prem, we’re not constantly spinning up new resources.\n\nAlso a lot of our workloads could likely be handled by managed services instead of EC2:\n\n* Web apps on App Runner or Elastic Beanstalk\n* Databases on RDS\n* Containers instead of long-running VMs\n* SMTP relay via Amazon SES instead of a self-managed server\n\nInstead, the approach tends to be more traditional: *“everything runs on EC2 with the necessary ports open.”*\n\nI’m 26 and don’t want to stagnate or fall behind industry best practices, though benefits and stress level for my role are overall very manageable.\n\nOn top of that, at this school the only real upward progression from my current role is into an IT Director / management position. While I respect that path, it’s not where I want to go right now. I want to continue growing as a hands-on technical engineer, not move into people management or budgeting-heavy leadership roles.\n\nLastly, due to it being a small IT department, everyone wears many hats, and (while seldomly) I may have to help manage cameras/speakers/projectors during events, help with cabling, end-user support, and on-prem infrastructure setup (if we are under-staffed).\n\n**What I’m trying to figure out:**\n\n* Whether I should try to specialize in devops/security/identity types of roles or stay put for the benefits, low stress, and W/L balance.\n* What roles realistically align with what I’m already doing.\n* What skills I’m missing that would unlock the next tier of roles.\n\nIf you were in my position:\n\n* What would your next move be?\n* What skills would you prioritize?\n* What job titles would you apply for?\n\nI appreciate any perspective.",

No one asked me to but I do it anyway. What's stopping you? It seems like you have broad control, permissions and whatnot...just because you're not standing up new resources frequently doesn't mean you can't deploy changes to existing systems through IaC. And do good Devops practices like build a representative prod environment and create a small pipeline to test/deploy changes to dev, write some tests to make sure it passes, and deploy to prod when the pipeline's green.",
