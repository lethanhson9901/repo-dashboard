      "text": "I wrapped up a tech panel for a Principal Azure Engineer role at an investment bank a couple of hours ago. This followed an interview with the hiring manager last Wednesday. We know each other from the past, i.e., I’ve interviewed for multiple roles at this firm over the last 5-6 years.\n\nThis role landed on my LinkedIn feed randomly. I commented on the post and emailed the hiring manager directly, we had a short back-and-forth, and his recruiter called me almost immediately. The process has been unusually smooth by modern standards.\n\nToday’s panel felt strong. I’m confident I cleared the bar with both the Azure SME and the hiring manager. I saw visible agreement on several answers, got verbal acknowledgment more than once and handled questions from a junior panelist with ease. I was told that I’m “first in line” (not sure if that means FIFO or first on the shortlist), however,  it seemed to be directionally positive.\n\nHere’s the problem: I was laid off a little over six months ago and I am EXHAUSTED. It's like I've been on the hamster wheels of interviews since 8/4/2025. I’ve done the prep, the loops, the panels, the follow-ups. I know I’m good enough to be gainfully employed as a DevOps engineer.\n\nIf this role doesn’t turn into an offer, I’m seriously questioning whether I want to continue in tech at all. I don’t know if I have it in me to keep doing 5–7 round interview gauntlets, only to be rejected for vague reasons like “culture fit” or not smiling enough. I’ve given my adult life to STEM / engineering / corporate IT / tech and I am exhausted from having to engage with recruiters who want someone to take managerial roles for IC level pay.\n\nI’m not bitter about rejection. I’m tired of dysfunction...hiring managers who don’t know the difference between EC2 and AWS Lambda, recruiters who can’t distinguish an AWS account from an Azure subscription and BS interview processes that ding candidates for being \"too intense\".\n\nSo I’m asking honestly: when is it time to walk away?\nFor those who’ve been at a similar crossroads...did you step back temporarily, change strategy or leave tech altogether?\n\n\nTL;DR: Six months, countless interviews, strong signals in today's tech panel. If today's tech panel doesn’t result in an offer, I’m seriously considering being done with the tech interview industrial complex.",

Pay them for their services.\n\nFar too many times I've seen good staff be let go because 'budget' or they don't fit the band, you lose far more searching for replacement, training and finding those skills in multiple other contractors or employees. New staff is good, new skills sets and fresh eyes, but some employees you don't let go over small amounts of money when they bring far more value.",

We were getting ready to release Cassandra 5 (I'm a committer) so I just did sessions about it, and it got a surprising amount of interest. I wrote my own tooling to provision database environments and it includes a lot of performance analysis tools, so I would show people how to understand how the DB behaves.  \n\nRegarding interviewing, after speaking at a conference Microsoft asked me to interview for a principle engineer position to run the Cassandra fleet.  Want to know how many database questions they asked me in my interview?  Zero. Instead they asked me to write shortest path in Java in a Google doc.  I haven't needed to even think about that in 20 years. I found it was easier to just have fun doing what I like instead of trying to conform to what an employer wanted me to be.  I absolutely *hated* working in big tech.  Now I'm working on stuff I actually love working on, because I get to make all my own decisions and do exactly what I want, whenever I want.\n\nI won't say it's easy, but it's rewarding if you can muscle through it. Find a niche you enjoy, talk about it, become relevant.  Make it easy for people to find you. \n\nGood luck.",

Obviously the reverse isn't good either(great social skills, lots of fluff on resume, lying about projects or how much they helped in said project, etc) \n\n\nedit: also to clarify, when I say \"social skills\" I don't mean how well you can present or lead a retro. I basically mean do you come off warm/friendly? Folks wouldn't be intimated to ask you a question? You can have back and forth feedback/discussion on ideas, problems & solutions without being flustered etc. I suck at presentations and avoid them when I can lol...\n\nThat's the only thing that comes to mind when someone says they get a lot of interviews, make it to the technical/final round but haven't landed anything.

Seven rounds to hire a DevOps engineer is insane. No other industry does this to senior professionals.\n\nBut here's the thing. You're not tired of tech. You're tired of the hiring theater around tech. Those are two very different things. Walking away from the work because the interview process is garbage is like quitting cooking because grocery stores have long lines.\n\nWhat I'd actually consider if I were you: stop playing their game entirely. Six months of interviews means six months of proving yourself to people who can't tell EC2 from Lambda. That energy could go into building something that proves your value without a panel deciding if you smiled enough. Consulting, contract work, building in public. Anything where YOUR work speaks instead of your performance in a 45 minute behavioral round.\n\nThe best move I ever made was realizing that the traditional hiring path isn't the only path. It's just the default one.\n\nHope you get this offer though. Sounds like you earned it.",

From there, we broke up our log groups. Separated out the logs we needed for auditing/compliance from the logs we needed for troubleshooting. Audit logs got the 12-month retention or whatever they required. Non-audit logs were set to 2-4 weeks, depending on the app. Next, we have been spending time auditing the logs themselves to ensure they have appropriate log levels. Debug/Trace never gets logged to CloudWatch.\n\nIt's a trickty knowing what to log. In December, we logged just over 1TB. January was 877GB, and this month we are on track to be just under 500 GB. We still have work to do. We could save a lot if we didn't use CloudWatch, but then the admin cost and effort to switch 50+ ECS services off CW... the worst part?

A few things that helped us reduce log costs significantly:\n\n1. **Structured logging levels by environment** - Debug/trace logs only in dev, never in prod. Sounds obvious but we found dozens of verbose logging statements that shipped to production.\n\n2. **Sample high-volume logs** - For requests/jobs that run thousands of times per hour, log 1% with full detail, rest with just errors. We hash the request ID and sample deterministically so you can still trace a specific request if needed.\n\n3. **Pre-filter before shipping** - We run a lightweight log processor on the app server that drops known noise (health checks, bot requests, etc.) before sending to our log aggregator. Cuts volume by ~40%.\n\n4. **Retention tiers** - Hot logs (7 days) in fast storage, warm logs (30 days) in cheaper storage, cold logs (90+ days) in S3/GCS with Athena/BigQuery for occasional queries.\n\nWhat's your current stack?

That second vendor charges per GB ingested, per host, per custom metric, per span. Your app grows, logs grow with it, and that bill scales independantly from the value youre actually getting. Thats why storage ends up costing more than the servers.\n\nFew things that helped me\n\nSelf hosting your observability stack (Grafana + Loki + Prometheus, or SigNoz as an all in one Datadog replacement) saves a ton but now youre babysitting more services. Worth it if you have the bandwith.\n\nSwitching to a platform that bundles observability into compute cost was the bigger win for me. I moved to Quave ONE and the built in Grafana dashboards, ingress metrics grouped by path/status/response time, app logs with search and WAF logs just come included. No agents, no collectors, no seperate bill. Covers like 80% of what I was paying Datadog for. Railway and Render have some built in metrics too and Coolify is solid if you want full self hosting on your own VPS.\n\nIf youre staying on Datadog/New Relic at least look at Grafana Cloud, free tier is surprisingly generous (50GB logs, 10k series) and paid is way cheaper per GB. Also ask your vendor about committed use discounts, most people dont and leave money on the table.\n\nThe logging hygene advice everyone else gave is real but if your setup is structurally designed to charge you twice for everything no amount of sampling fixes the underlying problem.",

Because behind the scene internally they have to manage more replicas for the backened.\n\nSo you have to check the ingestion layer first.

If someone is working in the water industry and doing integration we dont call it waterops.\n\nWhat are you are doing is just SWE work, nothing wrong with it really but it goes past the entire point of MLOps. \n\nMLOps is also a broad field, but for someone like me who has the title, I go all the down to how does our RDMA Networking interface with our MPI Code, what's the best scaling strategies? Whats the best auto-training and auto-feature selection strategies being automated? How does the model be robust enough to last 20 years without any human interference? How are you selecting your hardware based on your ML types? How are you selecting your storage? Is everything I am doing regarding this completely reproducible? Is everything I am doing completely auditable? \n\nLike things like model registry irk me, like someone never consulted what was actually running in production. Model registry and versioning for models would never work for someone like me, who has 15mil models running everyday. What does work is reproducible and storing what actual changes were made to the model.\n\nA lot of things you talked about in the post, could be done by devops person, there is no ML focus to what you have talked about apart from your software being a ML Product.\n\nThis isnt meant to be offensive to you, but a lot of people miss the ML part of MLOps. And IMO unless you know how to do the entire model from scratch ie be a machine learning engineer, you shouldnt pick up the title of MLOps",

We felt exhausted, and we all started looking for other roles. In the end, all it took was just hiring a couple more engineers so everyone would have time to experiment and improve every week.

The fake one had a postinstall hook that tried to exfil environment variables.\n\nI asked our security team what we do about this. They said use npm audit. npm audit only catches KNOWN vulnerabilities. It does nothing for zero-days or typosquatting.\n\nSo now I'm sitting here with a script took me months to complete that scans packages for sketchy patterns before CI merges them. It blocks stuff like curl | bash in lifecycle hooks ,Reading process.env and making HTTP calls ,Obfuscated eval() calls and Binary files where they shouldn't be and many more\n\nWorks fine. Caught the fake package. Also flagged two legitimate packages (torch and tensorflow) because they download binaries during install, but whatever just whitelist those.\n\nMy manager thinks I'm wasting time. \"Just use Snyk\" he says. Snyk costs $1200/month and still doesn't catch typosquatting.\n\nAm I crazy or is everyone else just accepting this risk?\n\nTool: [https://github.com/Otsmane-Ahmed/ci-supplychain-guard](https://github.com/Otsmane-Ahmed/ci-supplychain-guard)",

That's a better approach for supply chain attacks than any vulnerability scanner. Pair it with a registry proxy (Artifactory, Nexus, even Verdaccio) so nothing gets installed without going through your chokepoint, and you've got a stronger setup than most teams paying for Snyk.\n\nThe whitelist for legit binary-downloading packages is fine too.

The typosquatting vector alone has caught multiple supply chain attacks in the wild (event-stream, ua-parser-js, etc). Snyk and npm audit catch things after they are in the advisory database — your scanner catches the patterns before anyone has reported them.\n\nA few things that helped us:\n\n1. Socket.dev — does static analysis of packages before install, catches typosquatting and suspicious behavior patterns. Way cheaper than Snyk and specifically designed for this problem.\n\n2. Lockfile auditing in CI — diff the lockfile on every PR. New dependency additions should be reviewed like code changes, not rubber stamped.\n\n3. npm config set ignore-scripts true globally, then whitelist the packages that legitimately need lifecycle hooks. Most packages do not need postinstall. The ones that do (native addons, some binary downloads) can go on an explicit allow list.\n\nYour manager saying just use Snyk is like saying just use a firewall and not bothering with access controls. Different layers catch different things. What you built fills a real gap.",

Every new version and every update must be manually checked. You update once a month or so to fix security issues - or on demand for critical issues.\n\nThat's it.

          "text": "We mitigate this risk by having a Director of Security willing to constantly update us about the latest and greatest in ransomware attack vectors of all types, and by actually doing a bit of checking on new external libraries before including them. We're essentially looking for red flags in the maintenance history for the project or sometimes in the code itself. Humans are imperfect humans but the ones following best practices are less likely to become the weak leak leading to distribution of an exploit. We aren't at this time code-reviewing or running any static-code-analysis on these libraries, although it's not a terrible idea in principle. We have other things on the radar targeting this risk, like going all in on devcontainers so untrusted code is isolated in a container on the developer workstation, and getting in place a separate internal package registry for production along with a process for vetting and promoting specific builds of dependencies.\n\nThat, and good backups. Immutable backups, specifically. The thing you hope you'll never need, but will allow you to tell ransomware perpetrators to fuck off while rebuilding infrastructure from IaC and loading backups.\n\nWhether what you're doing is \"wasting time\" depends on the security stance in your organization which is up to technical leadership. Do the perceived risk of not using this outweigh the cost of maintaining it? Does the organization have the collective expertise to maintain an internal security scanning tool vs getting the best available existing coverage off the shelf? Security decisions are rarely black/white, but mitigation of security risk is a task that truly has no \"completed\" state so the business has to decide what is \"enough\".",

The story seems to be the same everywhere I go: A) join promising startup, do interesting work for a few years, C-suite cycles out, company either crashes, spins it's wheels for another few years, or we get acquired, or B) come close to jumping off a bridge studying for big tech roles, only to get to the final round to be told, \"hey, we were just kidding about full remote the three times you asked us, we need you in [insert city 1000 miles away here with a 2.5x CoL]\". If the market was better I'd start pivoting towards full on software engineering, but alas, many of our glorious technological leaders decided it was a good idea to cozy up to whatever governmental facade of the time would give them quick quarterly wins and over-gorged shareholders, so here we are.\n\nFor those of you older DevOps folk that successfully escaped and made career transitions without taking huge hits to your comp, what are you doing these days? Are you happy (or at least content)? Do you have regrats? \n\nA quick search seems like a lot of the threads asking these questions as of late are from AI doomers (which you know, understandable, I get it and hate it... but damn does it make reading Terraform docs so much easier) and folks unknowingly knee deep in a burn-out cycle; I want to hear from people that took the plunge and are happy with it, or at the very least, content not being in Cloud Infrastructure.",

Consulting org... Tried this, took 40% cut for 'brand' that didn't help. Unless it's a name like Accenture, you're better solo. Advise.... have to give some. Don't quit your job. Take 1 small project on weekends (10-15h/week). Price it at 1.5x your hourly rate. If you land 2 consistent clients, then make the jump. Biggest surprise for me are not technical skills. It's learning to scope work and say 'no' to bad-fit clients. I probably turned down 30% of inquiries last year. Last but really important Solo won't happen if friendship does not exist, so helping people or free I always got something in return really.

At that point i am sure you would find yourself being a real bridge between swe and csec/infosec teams and could probably move into the appsec space.  From there look at going for the cissp which is an absolute monster to slay ( well worth it though).  Then maybe add something ln the risk management space like maybe the crisc or one of the isaca certs.\n\nOnce you do make the move you will still find yourself drawing on your swe/devsecops experiences.\n\nJust remember what most ppl and textbooks miss thr point on.  Csec is about protecting people.  One of the ways we protect them is by protecting their data - but there are many other dimensions which aren't just about protecting data.  You will find people in the OT space who will really get this because,  well lets just say fail fast and fail early and having defective sodtware sure as f*ck doesn't fly when you have say a ventillator doing your breathing for you.\n\nThe cissp exam is a really interesting experience.  Because the subject matter is so broad,  its an adaptive test so if you get a question wrong it will start asking more questions on that area to shake you down.  \n\nHope this helps",

Close to 1.7x :/\n\nAbout the role: it is far more challenging, hair pulling on most days vs. my older 10yrs. It's far harder due to the amount and complexity of new daily issues, speed of daily changing platforms and immense amount of misunderstandings so you're generally on your own. AI has also made it extremely difficult to keep up, and to keep up with competition as well as other employees who rely on it almost blindly and will argue they know better (even management). Thus the amount of time tracking, explaining every minute and action, and politics in general makes it fee like burning out every week I'd say. Also I rarely ever do oncall in the past 6yrs and have absolutely excellent flexible working arrangements. Hope that helps.",

I’ll never work for a company that hires in India ever again either.

When a security alert fires, pull the 5-minute window around it and suddenly you see the full picture - what was deploying, what endpoints were hot, whether latency was already degraded.\n\nThe expensive-but-works answer is Datadog Security Monitoring + APM (or Elastic SIEM + APM). They handle correlation natively. Budget version is Grafana + Loki + Falco - works great but you build the glue yourself.\n\nBiggest lesson: do not try to build one unified dashboard.

When something changes, the safest option becomes another meeting to rebuild context.\n\nTeams that invest in structured documentation (clear process ownership, decision logs, ADRs tied to actual systems) tend to reduce this overhead.

If it's not in version control, reviewed, and tied to the actual system it describes, it rots.\n\nA corollary, I believe, is that you should have as little documentation as possible--no more. Replace ~~code~~ edit:docs with working code whenever possible. Deduplicate documentation as vigorously as you do your code. Hyperlink aggressively. Basically, systematically remove documentation that has the potential to rot.\n\nAs a really simple example, I like to replace \"getting started\" docs with a makefile. A makefile can be relatively high level, so it can somewhat serve as documentation. More importantly though, if the makefile (read: documentation) is wrong, it breaks and needs to get fixed. If it were regular documentation and it would break (i.e. be incorrect), then it really *doesn't* force you to fix it. So it often goes unfixed.",

The ones that get tested during incident response stay accurate. The ones that only get opened during onboarding rot because nobody feels the pain of them being wrong until the new hire is already confused.\n\nThe \"as little as possible\" point is underrated too.

It's like \"Ansible, for people\" - you build a plan, turn it into an executable runbook and track progress on a real-time dashboard as the work actually happens.

Figure out how to work with persistent volumes.\n\nBasically just come up with stuff that would be useful to you in your home and figure out how to stick it on k8s.\n\nI bought a CKA course on Udemy and it was useless to me.

Best way to build intuition is to take something you already run in Docker and deploy it to a local K8s cluster.\n\nInstall minikube or kind on your machine. Take one of your existing Docker containers and write a basic deployment yaml for it. Get it running. Break it. Fix it. That loop teaches you more than any Udemy course.\n\nThe concepts that actually matter for a backend engineer: pods, deployments, services, configmaps, secrets, and ingress. That covers 90% of what you'll touch day to day. Ignore everything else until you need it.\n\nOne thing I wish someone told me early: K8s is not Docker++. The mental model is completely different. Docker is \"run this container.\" K8s is \"declare what the end state should look like and let the system figure out how to get there.\" Once that clicks everything else makes sense.\n\nAfter you're comfortable with the basics, deploy something to a real cluster. EKS on AWS has a free tier that works. The gap between local minikube and an actual cloud cluster is where the real learning happens. Networking, load balancing, persistent storage. That's where it gets interesting.\n\nDon't bother with Helm charts or operators or service meshes yet. That's intermediate stuff that'll confuse you right now. Walk first.",

As well as making your task easier, it's got a whole lot of other advantages for the developers themselves. Multiple long-lived branches are being more and more considered an anti-pattern these days.\n\nYou need an immutable commit ref from which you can build a release candidate. With a single branch it's easy. Every commit merged into the mainline branch is built and stored as an artefact. Then when it's time to release, you take the commit you want to release, give it some reference (usually either a tag or a short-lived release branch) and your CD pipeline will promote that artefact through your environments. With multiple environment branches like how you've described it's much harder, because they're being merged into each other all the time and it's impossible to know which of those merge commits you need to be building as the release candidate.",

We use a git repo for this but there are other ways.\n\n3) If we need to hotfix we start by creating a hotfix branch from the tag that's being patched, then adding commits to that hotfix branch.  Once done, we cherry-pick the patches back to main if applicable.\n\nThe goal is to ensure that what we test in everyone environment is also what we promote; we never build again to promote.  If a version fails testing, it just never goes beyond that environment. We could remove those artifacts but we generally don't.",

Do the checks help achieve either one of those goals? If not, consider adjusting the settings. Some rules I just find to be pedantic and not helpful, so bring this up with your team and tweak it. \n\nSome checks, like autoformatters, I have run automatically as a pre-commit hook. That approach only works if the tool is very fast though (I use ruff which can lint and format my entire python repo in 2 seconds). This has helped me with the annoying feedback loop of committing, waiting 5 minutes, everything is green except the formatter, then needing to wait for everything again. \n\nYou mentioned having Snyk as a CI check, which stood out to me. Does this only check new dependencies you added in that PR, or check for vulnerabilities in existing packages? I could imagine a frustrating situation where some CVE comes out on an existing package, and then you can’t merge an emergency fix for a prod issue because you now need to also update the dependencies.\n\nPersonally I prefer using Snyk asynchronously. I set up a GitHub Actions cron to run “Snyk monitor” on the repo every night at 2am. We get weekly emails from Snyk with updates about any new vulnerabilities.",

      "text": "Mitchell Hashimoto got tired of watching open-source maintainers drown in AI-generated pull requests. So he built [Vouch](https://github.com/mitchellh/vouch), a contributor trust management system. The concept is almost absurdly simple: before you can submit a PR to a project using Vouch, someone already trusted has to vouch for you.\n\nThe whole thing lives in a single text file inside the repo. One username per line. A minus sign means denounced. You can parse it with grep.\n\nSigstore verifies artifacts. SLSA verifies builds. Dependabot checks dependencies. None of them answer the question of whether a given person should be contributing to a project at all. That's the gap Vouch fills: contributor trust, not artifact trust.\n\nHashimoto designed it the same way he designed Terraform. Declarative. Human-readable. Version-controlled. Instead of .tf files for infrastructure, you get .td files for trust. Same brain, different domain.\n\nThe xz-utils backdoor is the elephant in the room. \"Jia Tan\" spent two years earning trust through legitimate contributions before planting a CVSS 10.0 backdoor. Vouch wouldn't have stopped that attack. But the vouch record would've been visible in the git history, who vouched for them, when, and the denouncement would propagate to every project subscribing to that vouch list. Less of a lock, more of a security camera.\n\nGhostty is already integrating it. The repo picked up 600 stars in three days. A GitHub staff member commented on the HN thread saying they'd ship changes \"next week.\"\n\nThe concerns are real though. Gatekeeping is the obvious one. Open source is supposed to be open, and Vouch creates an explicit barrier where there wasn't one before. One HN commenter called it \"social credit on GitHub.\" The persona gaming problem hasn't gone away either; someone could still spend months building trust before going rogue.\n\nHashimoto himself flags it as experimental. But it's the first serious attempt at making contributor trust visible and version-controlled.\n\nI wrote up the full breakdown, including how Vouch compares to PGP's web of trust, Advogato, and Debian's maintainer process, [here](https://extended.reading.sh/vouch-pull-request) if you want the deep dive.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI recently reformatted my machine and realized how tedious it is to manually install Homebrew, configure Zsh, set up git aliases, and download all the necessary SDKs (Node, Go, Python, etc.) one by one.\n\nTo solve this, I built `mac-dev-setup` – a shell script that automates the entire process of bootstrapping a macOS environment for software engineering and DevOps.\n\n**Repo:**[https://github.com/itxDeeni/mac-dev-setup](https://github.com/itxDeeni/mac-dev-setup)\n\n**Why I built this:** I switch between an older Intel MacBook Pro and newer M-series Macs. I needed a single script that was smart enough to detect the architecture and set paths correctly (`/usr/local` vs `/opt/homebrew`) without breaking things.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* **Auto-Architecture Detection:** Automatically adjusts for Intel (x86) or Apple Silicon (ARM) so you don't have to fiddle with paths.\n* **Idempotent:** You can run it multiple times to update your tools without duplicating configs or breaking existing setups.\n* **Modular Flags:**\n   * `--minimal`: Just the essentials (Git, Zsh, Homebrew).\n   * `--skip-databases`: Prevents installing heavy background services like Postgres/MySQL if you prefer using Docker for that (saves RAM on older machines!).\n   * `--skip-cloud`: Skips AWS/GCP/Azure CLIs if you don't need them.\n* **DevOps Ready:** Includes Terraform, Kubernetes tools (kubectl, k9s), Docker, and Ansible out of the box.\n\n**What it installs (by default):**\n\n* **Core:** Homebrew, Git, Zsh (with Oh My Zsh & plugins).\n* **Languages:** Node.js (via nvm), Python, Go, Rust.\n* **Modern CLI Tools:** `bat`, `ripgrep`, `fzf`, `jq`, `htop`.\n* **Apps:** VS Code, iTerm2, Docker, Postman.\n\n**How to use it:** You can clone the repo and inspect the code (always recommended!), or run the one-liner in the README.\n\nBash\n\n    git clone https://github.com/itxDeeni/mac-dev-setup.git\n    cd mac-dev-setup\n    ./setup.sh\n    \n\nI’m looking for feedback or pull requests if anyone has specific tools they think should be added to the core list.\n\nHope this saves someone a few hours of setup time!\n\nCheers,\n\nitzdeeni",

Prior to this shift, I didn't handle heavy coding or application deployment logic. I’ve tried to be cooperative and learn fast to not be a bottleneck, but I'm struggling.\n​Legacy Nightmare: We took over a tech stack from a previous company that is incredibly messy, complicated, and unstructured.\n\n​Zero Delegation: Tasks aren't delegated well. I’m suddenly solely responsible for big features and deployments. If something breaks (frontend or backend), I have to front the issue and fix it alone.\n​I feel like I'm doing the work of a Lead Dev, a Senior DevOps, and L3 Support all at once. Is this level of scope creep normal for a Senior role, or am I being taken advantage of?\n\nNot much helping direct to your title but just as a person experiencing transition. Just a personal opinion, this experience helped me open my eyes on management, which can be nasty and pressuring, yet some soft skills to talk with internal management and to external management.",

But once you add long term storage like Thanos or Mimir, logs with Loki, and tracing with Tempo or Jaeger, you’re basically maintaining a small observability platform yourself.\n\nDatadog is smoother out of the box. Everything is correlated and onboarding new engineers is easier. But at scale the billing model and cardinality can start shaping how you instrument things.\n\nLately I’ve also seen teams look at newer approaches like Groundcover, which keeps the Prometheus compatibility but tries to simplify the stack and correlation side without stitching five tools together. Some are also experimenting with Grafana Cloud as a middle ground.\n\nIn the end it feels less like feature comparison and more about how much operational ownership you want versus how much abstraction you’re comfortable with.",

During an incident, having logs + metrics + traces in one pane with zero config is genuinely faster than jumping between Grafana, Loki, and Tempo dashboards. The problem: we hit ~$8k/mo and it kept climbing with every new service.\n\nPrometheus + Grafana + Loki works great if you have a platform team to maintain it. We didn't -- Thanos for HA alone ate a week of eng time every quarter. And the point about locking yourself out of logs during an outage (mentioned above) is real. We learned that the hard way.\n\nThe middle ground is where it gets interesting now. Grafana Cloud gives you managed Prometheus without the ops burden. SigNoz and OneUptime are solid open-source options if you want to self-host but don't want to glue together 4 different systems. OneUptime specifically bundles monitoring + logs + on-call + status pages, which helped us also kill our PagerDuty and Statuspage bills.\n\nMy advice: if your team is < 5 eng, the operational overhead of DIY Prometheus will eat you alive. Either go managed (Grafana Cloud) or pick something unified. If you have a dedicated platform team, Prometheus + Grafana is hard to beat on flexibility.",

The decision really comes down to: **Do you value control or convenience?**\n\n**Prometheus → Datadog reasons:**\n- **Alert fatigue** - Prometheus alerting config is YAML hell. Datadog's UI makes complex alert logic (multiple conditions, anomaly detection, forecast alerts) way easier.\n- **Unified observability** - Having metrics + logs + traces in one platform simplifies correlation. With Prometheus you're stitching together 3-4 tools (Prom + Loki + Jaeger/Tempo).\n- **Managed infrastructure** - Not dealing with Prometheus HA, TSDB sizing, retention management. This matters more as you scale.\n- **Query language** - PromQL is powerful but cryptic. Datadog's query builder + saved views are more accessible for non-SRE teams.\n\n**Datadog → Prometheus reasons:**\n- **Cost explosion** - Datadog pricing scales brutally with custom metrics and log volume. We hit k/month and realized 70% was log ingest we didn't need.\n- **Vendor lock-in** - Moving off Datadog is painful (all dashboards/alerts need rebuilding). Prometheus + Grafana is portable.\n- **Control** - Prometheus + long-term storage (Thanos/Cortex/Mimir) gives you full data ownership and infinite retention if needed.\n- **Cardinality limits** - Datadog has strict limits on tag cardinality. Prometheus handles high-cardinality metrics better (until you hit storage issues).\n\nHybrid approach we ended up with: Prometheus for metrics (self-hosted with Mimir for long-term storage), Datadog for logs and APM only. Gets us cost control on metrics while keeping the log/trace convenience.",
