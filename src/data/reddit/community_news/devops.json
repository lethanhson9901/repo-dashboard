But honestly, anyone who's worked with Terraform for a while knows that's just not true. The state file runs the show.  \n  \nNot long ago, I hit a snag with a team sure they’d locked down their security groups - because that’s what their HCL said. But they had a pile of old resources that never got imported into the state, so Terraform just ignored them. The plan looked fine. Meanwhile, the environment was basically wide open.  \n  \nWe keep telling juniors, “If it’s in Git, it’s real.” That’s not how Terraform works. What we should say is, “If it’s in the state file, it’s managed. If it’s not, good luck.”  \n  \nSo, does anyone else force refresh-only plans in their pipelines to catch this kind of thing? Or do you just accept that ghost resources are part of life with Terraform?",

They specify that so-and-so objects will exist in such-and-such ways, but they don't specify that *only* those objects and nothing else will exist -- and that's a not cool across so many fronts, not least being that the surface area is now...potentially infinite.  There are some motions in the area, for instance the difference between `google_project_iam_member` and `google_project_iam_binding` for Terraform for GCP, but it really isn't enough.\n\nImagine instead your cloud (sub-)account, AWS or GCP or whatever, with no default objects, no default VPC or networks or anything (ignore some of the access control problems that implies for a sec)....and that the only objects that subsequently existed in it were from Terraform or OpenTofu, and that any and every `tofu apply` would remove every single thing not explicitly defined in your IAC, no matter how it was created.\n\n  \nA huge PITA of course, especially at scale, but them's the breaks.",

As a DevOps-turned MLE/MLOps, there's a fine balance between letting data scientists work on models quickly, getting POCs done, all while making solutions scalable in the future. \n\nDon't get me wrong,  I love K8s, but I almost never get a project complex enough where requirements can't be met by something like ECS or Azure Container Apps - services with scaling without the \"complexity\" and what I'll call the \"scare factor\" of K8s for our co-workers.\n\nOtherwise, agree with the rest. No one cares about the true workload of MLOps, and more importantly, the underlying DevOps. I'm literally working for a client who tried outsourcing MLOps, and, a year and a failed cloud migration later, have come crawling back saying they were wrong.",

I chose Kubernetes because it's cloud agnostic (no lock-in like ECS or ACA), it's open-source and provides other long term capabilities for projects that are useful to scale.\n\nAs a consultant myself, I agree with everything you said.

If someone is working in the water industry and doing integration we dont call it waterops.\n\nWhat are you are doing is just SWE work, nothing wrong with it really but it goes past the entire point of MLOps. \n\nMLOps is also a broad field, but for someone like me who has the title, I go all the down to how does our RDMA Networking interface with our MPI Code, what's the best scaling strategies? Whats the best auto-training and auto-feature selection strategies being automated? How does the model be robust enough to last 20 years without any human interference? How are you selecting your hardware based on your ML types? How are you selecting your storage? Is everything I am doing regarding this completely reproducible? Is everything I am doing completely auditable? \n\nLike things like model registry irk me, like someone never consulted what was actually running in production. Model registry and versioning for models would never work for someone like me, who has 15mil models running everyday. What does work is reproducible and storing what actual changes were made to the model.\n\nA lot of things you talked about in the post, could be done by devops person, there is no ML focus to what you have talked about apart from your software being a ML Product.\n\nThis isnt meant to be offensive to you, but a lot of people miss the ML part of MLOps. And IMO unless you know how to do the entire model from scratch ie be a machine learning engineer, you shouldnt pick up the title of MLOps",

      "text": "So I'm a freelance developer and have been doing this now for 4-5 years, with half of my responsibilites typically in infra work. I've done all sorts of public/private sector stuff for small startups to large multinationals. In infra, I administer and operate anything from the single VPC AWS machine + RDS to on-site HPC clusters. I also operate some Kubernetes clusters for clients, although I'd say my biggest blindspot is yet org scale platform engineering and large public facing services with dynamic scaling, so take the following with a grain of salt.\n\nNow that I'm doing this for a while, I gained some intuition about the things that are more important than others. Earlier, I was super interested in best possible uptimes, stability, scalability. These things obviously require many architectural considerations and resources to guarantee success. \n\nNow that I'm running some stuff for a while, my impression is that many of the services just don't have actual requirements towards uptime, stability and performance that would warrant the engineering effort and cost. \n\nIn my quest to simplify some of the setups I run, I found what probably the old schoolers knew all along. Systemd+Journald is the GOAT (even for containerized workloads). I can go some more into detail on why I think this, but I assume this might not be news to many. Why is it though, that in this subreddit, nobody seems to talk about it? There are only a dozen or so threads mentioning it throughout recent years. Is it just a trend thing, or are there things that make you really dislike it that I might not be aware off?",

              "text": "I think the problem with this thinking is that some things are just easier to manage in Kubernetes. So you have a Kubernetes cluster. And now, suddenly, it's easier to throw everything into Kubernetes. Running things as systemd units loses a lot of its luster when you already have a kubernetes cluster laying around. And then it's easier to monitor those things in kubernetes if you use the Prometheus metrics stack because you automatically get metrics endpoint monitoring via the Prometheus ServiceMonitor CRD. And then it's easier to collect logs out of your applications because you likely already have something like Alloy/Vector/Promtail shipping kubernetes logs to a centralized logging database. And then it's easier to set up networking/DNS records because you likely already have an Ingress Controller to make your workloads reachable to the outside world, External-DNS to create your DNS records, and then instead of setting up certbot as yet another systemd unit to generate your TLS certificates you have something like cert-manager already in the cluster that will do it for you. And then instead of using something like monit to toggle your systemd units when they fail (as yet another systemd unit), you just have kubernetes doing that with its builtin container restarting behavior.\n\nI hear people call it resume driven systems admin, when it's really just kind of not true. It's ignoring how much Kubernetes ecosystem tooling does for you, that you aren't quantifying when you just say \"this could be a systemd unit.\" More like \"this could be a whole collection of systemd units, terraform, Ansible, and templated out service config files.... or just one Dockerfile and Helm values file.\" There just is no such thing as a good faith discussion about Kubernetes that starts off with \"this could just be a systemd unit\" because at that point you've already told a lie.",

If the market was better I'd start pivoting towards full on software engineering, but alas, many of our glorious technological leaders decided it was a good idea to cozy up to whatever governmental facade of the time would give them quick quarterly wins and over-gorged shareholders, so here we are.\n\nFor those of you older DevOps folk that successfully escaped and made career transitions without taking huge hits to your comp, what are you doing these days? Are you happy (or at least content)? Do you have regrats? \n\nA quick search seems like a lot of the threads asking these questions as of late are from AI doomers (which you know, understandable, I get it and hate it... but damn does it make reading Terraform docs so much easier) and folks unknowingly knee deep in a burn-out cycle; I want to hear from people that took the plunge and are happy with it, or at the very least, content not being in Cloud Infrastructure.",

Consulting org... Tried this, took 40% cut for 'brand' that didn't help. Unless it's a name like Accenture, you're better solo. Advise.... have to give some. Don't quit your job. Take 1 small project on weekends (10-15h/week). Price it at 1.5x your hourly rate. If you land 2 consistent clients, then make the jump. Biggest surprise for me are not technical skills. It's learning to scope work and say 'no' to bad-fit clients. I probably turned down 30% of inquiries last year. Last but really important Solo won't happen if friendship does not exist, so helping people or free I always got something in return really.

At that point i am sure you would find yourself being a real bridge between swe and csec/infosec teams and could probably move into the appsec space.  From there look at going for the cissp which is an absolute monster to slay ( well worth it though).  Then maybe add something ln the risk management space like maybe the crisc or one of the isaca certs.\n\nOnce you do make the move you will still find yourself drawing on your swe/devsecops experiences.\n\nJust remember what most ppl and textbooks miss thr point on.  Csec is about protecting people.  One of the ways we protect them is by protecting their data - but there are many other dimensions which aren't just about protecting data.  You will find people in the OT space who will really get this because,  well lets just say fail fast and fail early and having defective sodtware sure as f*ck doesn't fly when you have say a ventillator doing your breathing for you.\n\nThe cissp exam is a really interesting experience.  Because the subject matter is so broad,  its an adaptive test so if you get a question wrong it will start asking more questions on that area to shake you down.  \n\nHope this helps",

It's far harder due to the amount and complexity of new daily issues, speed of daily changing platforms and immense amount of misunderstandings so you're generally on your own. AI has also made it extremely difficult to keep up, and to keep up with competition as well as other employees who rely on it almost blindly and will argue they know better (even management).

If your outage is scheduled and communicated the impact on your users is minimal and you’ll get a lot less heat than if it goes down by accident. \n\nYou’re also likely making half that. \n\nIf nothing else a situation like this is an easy combo with higher ups to effectively get on yourself, “give me 6 months and I’ll cut the cost in half, I want a a full months worth of savings as a bonus or a title bump/promotion to DevOps Architect or whatever. You can be a superstar if you save the company anywhere near a quarter mil a year. \n\nThis isn’t experienced devs so I won’t harp on you too much but at this point you should have been able to understand the existing architecture to at least have an idea of what can safely be turned off, spun down, or migrated. \n\nAnd you can’t be this worried about taking down prod. From feature flags to full blue/green rollouts, robust testing and monitoring all the info and lessons learned are out there to absorb and implement. \n\nFrankly if you were brand new there’d be little better a situation to step in where you can immediately demonstrate your exact dollar value to the company.",

I wanted to try out their product before the interview came up, but, obviously, it was pretty much all locked behind paywalls.\n\nI was still quite junior at the time, working at my first job for about 2 years. We had a staging environment, so I wondered: maybe they do as well?\n\nI could have listed their subdomains and looked from there, but I was a noob and got lucky by just trying: [`app-staging.company.com`](http://app-staging.company.com)\n\nAnd I was in! I could create an account, subscribe to paid features using a Stripe test card (yes, I was lucky as well: they were using Stripe, as we did in my first job), and basically use their product for free.\n\nThis felt crazy to me, and I honestly felt like that hackerman meme, even though I didn’t know much about basic security myself. I’ll let you imagine the face of the CEO when he asked me if I knew a bit about their product and I told him I could use it for free.\n\nHe was impressed and honestly a bit shocked that even a junior with basic knowledge could achieve this so easily. I didn’t get the job in the end, as he was looking for an established senior, but that was a fun experience.\n\nIf you want to know a bit more about the story, I talk about it in more detail here:  \n[https://medium.com/@arnaudetienne/is-your-staging-environment-secure-d6985250f145](https://medium.com/@arnaudetienne/is-your-staging-environment-secure-d6985250f145) (no paywall there, only a boring Medium popup I can’t disable)",

At minimum: separate auth (SSO or VPN, or at least IP allowlists), separate Stripe project or sandbox with clear flags, and a big visual banner so screenshots and links don’t leak and confuse everyone.\n\n\n\nI also like treating staging URLs as secrets in themselves: no obvious app-staging.\\* patterns, and auto-expiring preview environments per PR. Tools like Cloudflare Access and Tailscale make it pretty painless, and I’ve used Snyk plus Pulse for Reddit and Datadog to catch when those staging quirks start leaking into user-facing issues or public chatter.

The contradiction dissolves once you realize we're not choosing between \"all cloud\" or \"all on-prem\" anymore—we're building hybrid stacks out of necessity. K8s actually makes that mess manageable, which is probably why adoption keeps climbing even as repatriation does.\n\n  \nThe $600B capex bet is wild though. Hyperscalers are banking on AI inference costs dropping dramatically once they hit scale, but they're currently losing money on every workload. That only works if they either (a) crush operating costs through automation, or (b) charge enough to make margin when their utilization finally maxes out. Neither is guaranteed.\n\n  \nWhat actually kills me is watching teams self-host inference on cheaper hardware and getting better latency + cost than cloud pricing. That trend alone might explain the repatriation spike better than any compliance story.",

We made templates for things like python-fastapi-microservice and using copier they can generate a whole new repo with all the defaults for pipelines, security, etc. Further when we need to push a new version of a library, helm chart or something else, update the template and copier sends PRs updating to every repo using the template.

If you want to tinker with a bigger VM for testing or need a GPU, you can just start a VM in the UI that is sized for your workload.\n\nThe organization can manage templates and security much better since the IT admin stays in control of the infrastructure. Also for security no random ssh keys, or firewall rules you conect using the coder agent.\n\nFinally, some people need a development environment but don't have the \"VPS admin\" knowledge.

That might mean building arm64 images in your CI to make sure it always works or something, but that is another can of worms. Also, if you have any IO intensive apps (literally anything using Node.js because of `node_modules`), you will have to make sure developers clone repos inside of volumes inside of your Docker Engine VM (VS Code and JetBrains both support it). Otherwise, you will be bind mounting your files from the host into the VM and get really bad IO performance. \n\nFor remote, Codespaces will probably be the best experience if you already use Github. It is all there, but I know GitPod is also devcontainer based. Any of the devcontainer based ones should be great.

Basically, to really stop someone determined, you’ll need SELinux or AppArmor.\n\nAn easier solution would be to have ephemeral VMs (which sounds an awful lot like a container), with $HOME mounted to a network share, or at least a persistent disk. Let people experiment as they see fit in the VM, but make it very clear that every night / weekend (whatever makes sense for your work), everything not in $HOME goes away, so they **must** have dependencies properly saved, etc.\n\nEven then, you *still* run the risk of someone creating a special snowflake with a shell script that they run after every reset, but at that point, it’s more of a personnel issue rather than a technical one.\n\nYou might also consider CI being the ultimate arbiter. If a build doesn’t pass in CI, with an agreed-upon and controlled environment, *it doesn’t pass.* It’s then up to the devs to figure out what drift they’ve introduced.

Not just any layout - this one had a main control unit powered with 2 processors and 4 gigs of memory. Tied to it were two smaller helpers, each carrying 1 processor plus 4 gigs of RAM. Instead of manual updates, Argo CD now handles rolling out apps wherever needed in the system. Monitoring runs through Grafana, which pulls data via Node Exporter, showing everything on a live screen.\n\nA fixed IP now links to the host, set through DHCP so it stays the same even when power cycles happen, making remote logins smooth. Skipping Ubuntu's desktop (GNOME) layer freed up roughly 1.5 gigs of memory, leaving extra room for cluster tasks.\n\nMy question: **Would this be considered resume‑worthy for a DevOps/Cloud/Infra role?**   \nIf yes, how should I frame it — as a homelab project, a personal project, or something else?\n\nAny advice on how recruiters view homelab projects like this would be super helpful!\n\nThanks in advance ",

A lot of DevOps careers are spent composing managed building blocks, so people can end up trusting the abstractions without ever building (or debugging) high availability from first principles.\n\n\nIn a homelab you inevitably run into the sharp edges that managed services hide: failure domains, quorum behavior, storage latency, networking quirks, upgrades, backups, and recovery. Working through those problems is where the learning happens, and it tends to make you both more effective in the cloud and more appreciative of what you’re paying for.\n\n\nOne nuance, though: \"homelab\" sometimes gets dismissed in interviews as a hobby or “toy project.” It can help to frame it in concrete, production-like terms - what was designed for redundancy, what failure scenarios were tested, how monitoring/alerting was set up, how upgrades and rollbacks were handled, what the backup/DR story looked like - rather than relying on the word \"homelab\" to carry the meaning.\n\n\nAnd if the setup includes something like Ceph/Rook, even at small scale, that can expose you to operational realities many DevOps engineers never touch. A strong DevOps lead will usually recognize that kind of hands-on experience as a signal that you understand systems - not just how to click together cloud resources.",

      "text": "I work at a mid-sized AEC firm (\\~150 employees) doing automation and computational design. I'm not a formally trained software developer - I started in a more traditional domain expertise role and gradually moved into writing C# tools, add-ins, and automation scripts. There's one other person doing similar work, but we're largely self-taught.\n\nOur file infrastructure runs on a Linux Samba server with 100TB+ of data stored serving all 150 + maybe 50 more users. The development workflow that existed when I started was to work directly on the network drives. The other automation developer has always done this with smaller projects for years and it seemed to work fine.\n\n**What Happened**\n\nI started working on a project to consolidate scattered scripts and small plugins into a single, cohesive add-in. This meant creating a larger Visual Studio solution with 30+ projects - basically migrating from \"loose scripts on the network\" to \"proper solution architecture on the network.\"\n\nOver 7-8 days, the file server experienced complete outages lasting 30-40 minutes daily. Users couldn't access files, work stopped, and IT had to investigate. IT traced the problem to my user account holding approximately **120 simultaneous file handles** \\- significantly more than any other user (about 30).\n\nThe IT persons sent an email to my manager and his boss saying that it should be investigated what I'm doing and why I could be locking so many files basically framing it as if I am the main cause of the outages. The other cause they have stated is that the latest version of the main software used in the AEC field (Autodesk Revit) is designed to create many small files locked by each individual user which even though true, to me sounds like a ridiculous statement as a cause for the server to crash.\n\nShould a production file server serving 200 users be brought down by one user's 120 file handles? I've already moved to local development - that's not the question. I want to understand whether I did something genuinely problematic or the server couldn't handle normal development workload. Even if my workflow was suboptimal, should it be possible for one developer opening Visual Studio to bring down the entire file server for half an hour? This feels like a capacity planning issue.\n\nHere's how they announced their discovery of the cause of the crashes to management with the email they sent:\n\n>After analyzing the logs, it was determined that one specific user (UID ...) was causing repeated server crashes.\n\n>Here is what the data shows for today between 16:34 and 17:04:\n\n>Time  \nNumber of Locks  \nAction  \n16:36  \n117  \nTerminated  \n16:38  \n116  \nTerminated  \n16:40  \n119  \nTerminated  \n16:42  \n114  \nTerminated  \n16:44  \n113  \nTerminated  \n16:46  \n112  \nTerminated  \n16:48  \n111  \nTerminated  \n16:50  \n115  \nTerminated  \n16:52  \n110  \nTerminated  \n16:54  \n108  \nTerminated  \n16:56  \n111  \nTerminated  \n16:58  \n137  \nTerminated  \n17:00  \n110  \nTerminated  \n17:02  \n108  \nTerminated  \n17:04 hours  \n108  \nTerminated  \n15 times in 30 minutes the system has terminated this user's session, but every time he reconnects and creates over 100 locks.\n\n>A normal user creates 5-20 locks. This user creates 100-140 locks on the same folder, which:\n\n>Blocks access for the remaining \\~200 users  \nOverwhelms file management system  \nRequires manual restart of Samba to recover  \nPlease identify the activity of this user:\n\n>What software does he use besides standard Revit?  \nDoes he run his own scripts or plugins?  \nDo you work with Dynamo Player or other automation tools?  \nDoes he have many projects open at the same time?  \nWorkaround: If you cannot contact the user immediately, I can temporarily block his access to the server. This will prevent him from working, but will protect other users.  \nPlease confirm whether I should proceed with a temporary block.",

The server was already at its limits and your workflow just happened to be the straw that broke it. The real question IT should be asking is why their file server has no connection limits, no resource quotas per user, and apparently no monitoring that would have caught it before a 30-40 minute outage. A properly configured Samba instance handles thousands of concurrent handles without breaking a sweat. You were right to move to local dev, but don't let them frame this as your fault.

When your prod deploy fails at 2am because some upstream Helm repo is having an outage, you'll wish you had vendored. With ArgoCD specifically, you can use a Helm chart repository as a source but pin to exact versions. The middle ground that works well: keep your Chart.yaml with dependencies pointing to upstream repos, but commit the charts/ directory (the output of helm dependency build). That way you have the full source vendored for reliability, but the Chart.yaml still documents where it came from and what version you're on. Run helm dependency update in CI periodically to check for new versions. For the security angle, Renovate or Dependabot can watch your Chart.yaml and open PRs when new chart versions drop, so you get visibility into updates without manually checking.",

Vendoring full charts is a maintenance trap — you end up with massive diffs on every upstream update that nobody actually reviews.\n\nThe unavailable-repository fear is real though. Two approaches depending on scale:\n\n**Small team**: Just keep a `Chart.lock` with version + SHA. If the upstream disappears, you have the exact version to hunt down or reconstruct. Most major charts (prometheus, ingress-nginx, grafana) are on multiple mirrors.\n\n**Larger org**: Run a ChartMuseum or Harbor instance as a pull-through cache. Every chart you reference gets cached automatically. Nexus works too if you already have it for other artifact types. This also gives you an audit trail of which chart versions ever entered your cluster.\n\nWith ArgoCD specifically, the source hydrator feature someone mentioned is great for this — it renders to static manifests at sync time, so even if the chart repo is gone, your last-synced state is preserved as plain YAML in git. Best of both worlds: you get the ergonomics of Helm templating with the auditability of committed manifests.",

I needed a single script that was smart enough to detect the architecture and set paths correctly (`/usr/local` vs `/opt/homebrew`) without breaking things.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* **Auto-Architecture Detection:** Automatically adjusts for Intel (x86) or Apple Silicon (ARM) so you don't have to fiddle with paths.\n* **Idempotent:** You can run it multiple times to update your tools without duplicating configs or breaking existing setups.\n* **Modular Flags:**\n   * `--minimal`: Just the essentials (Git, Zsh, Homebrew).\n   * `--skip-databases`: Prevents installing heavy background services like Postgres/MySQL if you prefer using Docker for that (saves RAM on older machines!).\n   * `--skip-cloud`: Skips AWS/GCP/Azure CLIs if you don't need them.\n* **DevOps Ready:** Includes Terraform, Kubernetes tools (kubectl, k9s), Docker, and Ansible out of the box.\n\n**What it installs (by default):**\n\n* **Core:** Homebrew, Git, Zsh (with Oh My Zsh & plugins).\n* **Languages:** Node.js (via nvm), Python, Go, Rust.\n* **Modern CLI Tools:** `bat`, `ripgrep`, `fzf`, `jq`, `htop`.\n* **Apps:** VS Code, iTerm2, Docker, Postman.\n\n**How to use it:** You can clone the repo and inspect the code (always recommended!), or run the one-liner in the README.\n\nBash\n\n    git clone https://github.com/itxDeeni/mac-dev-setup.git\n    cd mac-dev-setup\n    ./setup.sh\n    \n\nI’m looking for feedback or pull requests if anyone has specific tools they think should be added to the core list.\n\nHope this saves someone a few hours of setup time!\n\nCheers,\n\nitzdeeni",

I started as a Junior DevOps Engineer and moved into a Senior role after 2 years.\n\n​Recently, management transitioned me into a \"Developer\" role. However, they didn't remove my Ops responsibilities; they just added a massive amount of dev work.\n\n​My current scope now includes:\n​Full Stack Dev: Feature development, bug fixes, hotfixes.\n​Ops: Infrastructure management, CI/CD, Deployment ownership.\n​Support: L3 Support, deep troubleshooting.\n​QA/Lead: Code reviewing.\n\n​The Problem:\n​Background Mismatch: My background is purely Ops/Infra. Prior to this shift, I didn't handle heavy coding or application deployment logic. I’ve tried to be cooperative and learn fast to not be a bottleneck, but I'm struggling.\n​Legacy Nightmare: We took over a tech stack from a previous company that is incredibly messy, complicated, and unstructured.\n\n​Zero Delegation: Tasks aren't delegated well. I’m suddenly solely responsible for big features and deployments. If something breaks (frontend or backend), I have to front the issue and fix it alone.\n​I feel like I'm doing the work of a Lead Dev, a Senior DevOps, and L3 Support all at once. Is this level of scope creep normal for a Senior role, or am I being taken advantage of?\n\nNot much helping direct to your title but just as a person experiencing transition. Just a personal opinion, this experience helped me open my eyes on management, which can be nasty and pressuring, yet some soft skills to talk with internal management and to external management.",
