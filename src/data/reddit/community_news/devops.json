Our scale is not that big, but the usage patterns (very fast ramp-up in traffic spikes and a nation-wide streaming service) are similar and we have encountered the same problems.  \n  \nWe minimized the use of NAT-gateways by leveraging transit gateways and avoided the ip-exhaustion by using IPv6. DNS performance has been a problem for us, but we finally fixed it for good by implementing node-local DNS-cache, getting rid of all alpine-images and setting ndots to 3.  \n  \nThe scaling up is still difficult to do fast enough, but by minimizing the size of container images, using fast pull-through caches for them, overprovisioning clusters so there's always free capacity and scaling replicas based on request count instead of CPU, we have managed to make it just fast enough to work 90% of time. We still need to manually scale up the minimum replicas before large events, though.",

Those chunks were published via CDNs to limit our own bandwidth needs. The “list of chunks” was kept current through the CDN with a short TTL.\n\nThe only thing a user had to be connected to us directly for was the DRM. But a single request to that system was good enough for 30 minute chunks, so scaling it was super easy.\n\nWhile there is inherently some delay in this architecture, it was only 30-60s (when I worked there 10 years ago; Maybe less now).",

Given my experience, what are my options for a career change?\n\nHonestly, I'm at a point where I don't mind cutting my salary by half if that means I can actually have a life.\n\nI thought about teaching some DevOps skills, there are a bunch of courses out there, but not sure if it'll be an improvement or stressful just the same.",

There is no on call, customers get billed by the hour. I settled with a great firm full time, but they still bill me by the day (8 hours) and unless a client is insane they would not put you on call like that, and good firms wouldn’t let that happen. Caveat, you go to places without a DevOps culture who need a lot of changes, but that’s where you end up with multi year contracts. You may due some work outside of that on business development, but by and large it’s a very contained process and a true meritocracy. ",

          "text": "For those who are early in their careers and seeing this...learn this lesson the easier way. When I was first starting out, I worked closely with a Network Admin. He loved what he did, he was passionate about tinkering, and he'd often experiment or work on open source projects in his free time. He was also very bad at setting boundaries with management and with the job. A couple of years later, he hit his ten year mark and started to lose it a bit. I tried to help him where I could, but he was constantly stressed and depressed. Eventually, he sort of snapped and walked away. It took him quite a few years to get back to a healthy place and start working full-time again.\n\nI saw all of that in my first three years. I love what I do and I'm passionate about it, and I enjoy experimenting with side projects or working on open source projects. Very occasionally, I have to work strange hours, but I've worked really hard to prioritize two things: my mental health and my salary, in that order. I'm now at my ten year mark, and every now and then I start to feel a bit burned out. But I've set boundaries and I've worked hard to get better about leaving work at work, instead of allowing my mind to keep thinking through some problem. After all, the problem will still be there tomorrow, anyway.\n\nI only do all of this because I saw my coworker and friend fall apart. I realized my passion could be turned against me and that, frankly, there's a lot of bullshit from management/corporate that tries to use that passion to manipulate you. Be wary of it and mentally prepare yourself. And don't be afraid to occasionally grab an \"easy\" job, even if the pay isn't perfect. I've taken a job or two that I knew would likely be easy-going and the pay was so-so, but I knew I needed a slight break. Usually I'd get bored within 6-12 months, at which point I'd start to lean in and move up in the company or start looking for new opportunities.\n\nOP, I hope you find what you're looking for. I'd recommend looking for smaller companies that have a more laid-back IT presence. You could also dip into government contract work (assuming you can pass a background check). I think some people exaggerate a bit about government work, but I can certainly confirm that government contractors work at an exponentially slower pace than the start-ups I've worked for.",

For Azure it's simply FUBAR on many fronts, e.g. implement AMPLS to get health checks to private infrastructure and suddenly your VM agent installations are broken because they happen to use the same domain for downloads or configuration as your observability ingestion. Similar architecture design and implementation issues, mostly because of really bad documentation. Getting your logs archived is a whole month-long project because they have shoehorned you to put everything into a log workspace and use the exporting rules, and those blobs do not even support archiving. Duplicating at the source gets you different formats as now you have three implementations (log export rule, data collection rule and platform logs). It's a fucking mess.\n\nPaid monitoring platforms like Datadog etc. keep shining, but have scummy business practices and know what they have, so you are paying a $$$$$ premium for something that platform-native monitoring solutions could do almost for free while not trying to get fucked over by them which they actively try to do to squeeze money out of you.\n\nPagerDuty I have worked with recently and it's just a complete freaking mess. Undocumented everything, magic everywhere, nothing useful on the important part like getting stuff into the platform in a robust and sane way etc. Even then alert management leave a lot to be desired.\n\n---\n\nAll in all, I believe the only viable, scalable and especially operatable implementation is the classic OSS Grafana+Prometheus+Loki stack with some development and design time under it.",

The problem is when something breaks, you’re staring at data without knowing which change actually mattered. That’s where things get messy. The teams handling this better are closing the gap between code changes and runtime signals. They track not just what failed, but what behavior was introduced. That context comes from understanding PR-level intent, dependencies, and flow changes, not from dashboards. We’ve seen this internally while building CodeAnt AI: when reviewers understand impact upfront (what paths change, which services are touched, what assumptions shift), production observability becomes confirmation, not discovery.\n\nSo in 2026, observability isn’t cleaner tools, it’s fewer unknowns. Less guessing which deploy caused it. Less spelunking. More continuity between code, review, and runtime.",

Now they have changed this strategy, but they moved to a slightly more fair pay for what you use strategy again mostly. Paying for ingest makes sense, however our new issues are with queries. We are now charged for these, a single dashboard for query to try and identify a root cause can go through such a large quantity of data and add up extremely quick. We have tried, but we were given zero ways to optimize these queries as we only ran into their platform limitations and they really just want us to pay. Again as an observability company, they seem to have zero interest in obseravability.  \n\\- Their UI brings even modern PCs to their kness, dashboards being the worst. We also struggled to get it to asign users tot he correct accounts if a user had multiple orgs assigned. So they constantly logged in and saw the wrong data, which was easy to change once they realised, but frustrating  \n\\- Their account managers for our region have all left and we were given an overseas team who simply did not care about our business, only signing the next years contract.\n\nThis is a competitive space, NR seems like they have a lot to offer, but they stopped major innovation a while back, many competitors are hungry for that market share now.",

Steep price hikes, very few valuable new features, and lots of questionable redesigns (only one of them positive, the  tabs in the query view).  Their observability for Kubernetes started out terrible and has not improved in the slightest... and that's been an ongoing painpoint. \n\nI still think NRQL is the best observability query language I've seen though... but I'm willing to deal with the alternatives if it means a longer-term viable platform.

      "text": "Hey everyone — I few days ago I was told my role is being made redundant, and around 50% of the company is being laid off due to budget cuts. I had a feeling it might be coming, but I didn’t realise things were this bad.\n\nSince 2020 I have just been husting to finish uni, working part time, paying off my debts, and then rushing to crack an interview for my first big boy job and then after 4 years of working I get laid off. I know people have had it much worse but I still feel like crap.\n\nSince getting the news, I’ve been pretty overwhelmed. This was my first proper job after Uni.\n\nI went into full apply and started applying like crazy — tailoring resumes, writing cover letters, the whole lot. I’ve put in 30+ applications in the last 3–4 days. Some roles are a perfect match, others are more like 80% or 60%, and I’m trying to be realistic and apply to adjacent roles too.\n\nBut now I’m hitting a wall — I’m exhausted, and then I feel guilty when I’m not applying. On top of that, seeing 100+ applicants on LinkedIn makes it feel like I’m shouting into the void.\n\nFor those of you who’ve been through layoffs/redundancy before:\n\nIs this “high volume + tailored” approach actually the right move?\n\nHow did you pace yourself without burning out?\n\nAny tips for targeting a niche field (even through you have 60-70% of other skills for other roles) when there just aren’t many openings? \n\nMy work domain is: Kubernetes/HPC/Linux/IaC/Automation...etc etc\n\nWould really appreciate any advice or even just hearing how others are coping. And how long do you set the boundary or the time box? As in how long should I put into the search for the right job (nische field) compared to grabbing whatever I get next. And since im in IT/Tech applications dont get assessed until the applications are closed and then it takes 1-3 weeks for the recruiters to actually get to it.\n\nI wish I had a knob I could turn and fast forward time by a few months.\n\nSorry for the rant and TIA.",

I kept interviewing with other prospects and hooked up with a great position elsewhere and had to resign after only 2 weeks at the defense contractor. Best move but I felt awkward for being on job for 2 weeks and bailing . That next job lasted 4 yrs and propelled me  even higher to my next role, which then propelled me to the one after that.

APPLY for the jobs you'd feel comfortable doing, apply even for things that you might not particularly have an experience with, but are close enough for you to catch up (eg. learning different cloud platform than you used to work with). I'd say if you meet 60% of requirements/nice-to-haves, apply. Worst thing that can happen is that company will not decide on contacting you. Who cares?

Most of those will be speculative and/or poor quality.\n\nDon’t be intimidated by job ads. Try to see past the tone and requirements, and really understand what the hiring company wants and needs. And how that fits with what you can offer.\n\nIf you have the core of what they need, then apply and foreground that experience. Hiring companies will ‘make do’ with people who lack some of what a job ad is asking for, if that person can show/indicate high proficiency in the things that matter. In fact, they may turn down people who can check all the boxes, in favour of someone who is showing higher proficiency in critical areas.\n\nGood luck.

Instead, make sure it's clear that you have _production_ K8s experience, and aren't just someone that's watched a bunch of Youtube videos and is claiming they know what they're doing.\n\n> Any tips for targeting a niche field (even through you have 60-70% of other skills for other roles) when there just aren’t many openings?\n\nAlways remember that job descriptions are the written for the \"ideal/perfect/doesn't actually exist\" candidate. They're not expecting you to have all of those skills (and I would say having 60-70% of the skills is what they're actually looking for). It's more of \"these are the tech stacks you can expect to be eventually responsible for in this role.\"\n\nLikewise, make sure you've got your LinkedIn profile set to \"Open to remote work\" in other cities.\n\nAnother option is to reach out to local recruiters. Only do that if you're desperate, because they're basically glorified sales people that spam LinkedIn and then expect to profit off of your labour for the rest of your contract simply because they arranged an interview for you.\n\nFinally, yes to timeboxing your applications! While you've got the downtime, use this freedom to reboot your physical and mental health. Hit the gym, go for walks, hang with friends.... you'll miss that free time when you land another role.\n\nGood luck, you've got this!",

Also, while trying to keep your skills fresh is important, to me it kind of felt like luck if I happened to overlap since a bunch of places asked very specific questions.

From what I can tell, it always tend to list 100+ applicants as some sort of bare minimum.  I don't pay attention to it at all.  The only thing I care about is \"freshness\" (older than a month, posted this week) and job match.  I don't consider LinkedIn to be too bad since 1) that's where I got my last job that I was laid off from and worked the past 4 years and 2) while I'm getting fast rejections I AM getting responses (and thus, likely legitimate job postings).\n\nIf you only found out a few days ago, then I'm not sure why you'd get discouraged right off the bat.  I've always found jobs around 1 month after I started job hunting in the past, but I consider those good times when the job market was stronger.  I wouldn't find it beyond the ordinary for a job search in today's market to take 3+ months.\n\nSince I did get the opportunity to play a DevOps Engineer on TV, I've integrated AI into various parts of my workflow (using Firecrawl MCP to scrape ATS and job boards, using chrome-devtools MCP to scrape LinkedIn/Indeed/Glassdoor/Builtin, tailoring resumes with python-docx).  Most of my effort is spent filtering out bad matches, and I'm averaging 7+ job applications per week.\n\nIf I'm not applying for jobs or tuning my AI-workflow, then I'm spending my time learning Golang.  If I get done with that, then I'll brush up on Bash/Python.  If I'm done with that, maybe I'll take the CKA.\n\nMy time is either spent:\n\n1. Searching for and applying to jobs.\n\n2. Doing something to pad my resume.",

A lot of us learned by struggling through docs, half-broken tutorials, and hours of debugging tiny mistakes. When you’ve put in that kind of effort, watching someone get unstuck with a prompt can feel like the whole grind didn’t matter. That reaction makes sense, especially if learning to code was tied to proving you could survive the pain. \n\nBut I don’t think AI ruined coding, it just shifted what matters. Writing syntax was never the real skill, thinking clearly was. AI is useful when you already have some idea of what you’re doing, like debugging faster, understanding unfamiliar code, or prototyping to see if an idea is even worth building. Tools like Cosine for codebase context, Claude for reasoning through logic, and ChatGPT for everyday debugging don’t replace fundamentals, they expose whether you actually have them. Curious how people here are using AI in practice rather than arguing about it in theory.",

I've seen multiple instances where experienced, senior contributors had generated a ton of code, only for us to later figure out that it actually did literally nothing of value, or was completely unnecessary.\n\n\nI'm also angry when people don't take responsibility for the changes they are making via LLMs. No, Claude didn't write this code, *you* decided that this PR is ready for review and worth your team members' time looking at.\n\n\n> Writing syntax was never the real skill, thinking clearly was. \n\n\nFull ack on that. But this raises the question which tools and techniques help us think clearly, and how we can clearly communicate the result of that thinking.\n\n\nProgramming languages are tools for thinking about designs, often with integrated features like type systems that highlight contradictions.\n\n\nIn contrast, LLMs don't help to think better or faster, but they're used for outsourcing thinking. For someone who's extremely good at reviewing LLM output that might be a net positive, but I've never met such a person.\n\n\nIn practice, I see effects like confirmation bias degrade the quality of LLM-\"assisted\" thought work. Especially with a long-term and growth-oriented perspective, it's often better and faster to do the work yourself, and to keep using conventional tools and methods for thought. It might feel nice to skip the \"grind\", but then you might fail to build actually valuable problem solving skills.",

I think its given countless people who’re learning to code even greater and easier/faster to access help in figuring out how to do this or that early on (think simple syntax issues etc). On the flip side, a huge negative I see is that too many people use ai as a crutch. Where in many cases they lean too heavily on ai to code things for them to the point where they’re not actively learning/coding as much as they perhaps should in order to advance their career and grow in the profession. \n\n\nNow as far as jobs go in mid to senior levels, I think ai has increased efficiency and in a way helped businesses somewhat eliminate positions for jr/level 1 engineers as level 2s, 3s etc can make great use of ai to quickly scaffold out or outright fix minor issues that perhaps otherwise they’d give to a jr dev - atleast this is what I’ve seen locally with some companies around me. That said, this same ai efficiency also applies for juniors in their current roles, I’d just caution them to truly learn and grow as they go, and not depend entirely on ai to do everything for them.",

Using AI to find solutions takes away the part of the work I actually enjoy, and leaves me with only the parts I hate. In the amount of time it takes me to explain to an AI what I need, I could have skim read the docs on whatever Terraform provider and done it myself. If I need something larger, I’m going to spend all my time reading through whatever the AI output to make sure it’s what I’m looking for, and to confirm that it hasn’t hallucinated a bunch of arguments that don’t actually exist. To me, that is far less interesting than actually putting things together myself. I can see where the efficiency gains come from, but for me, it takes away the only reasons I can tolerate being in this field.

In my case, I plan to:\n   * Install a **base Argo CD**\n   * Then use **Argo CD itself** to install and manage the **Argo CD Vault Plugin**\n\nBasically, I want to avoid tool overlap and follow what’s actually used in production today, not just what’s technically possible.\n\nWould appreciate hearing how others are doing this in real setups.\n\n\\---  \n**Disclaimer:**  \nUsed AI to help write and format this post for grammar and readability.",

That gets the Kubernetes cluster up. For the first time install of Argo CD we use a Helm chart, sometimes Terraform's Helm provider but often it is a manual apply because it only happens once at cluster bootstrapping. After that Argo CD manages everything else including itself via its own manifests in a GitOps repo. If we need to upgrade Argo CD or roll out a new version we update the Git repo and let Argo CD reconcile itself. Ansible did not really fit into the pipeline once we committed to everything living in the cluster. It is more for legacy VM config or when we need to do something directly on a node for weird edge cases. As for plugin installs we do the same thing, define it in Git and let Argo CD roll it out alongside everything else. In production I have seen that once Argo CD is there you do not want to mix too many config tools anymore. Makes life easier to keep that boundary clean.",

If not, ArgoCD is just going to add noise.  The nice thing about terraform is the ease in which you can destroy resources. I can use Ansible to provision my cloud resources pretty easily. But then have to write almost as many plays in reverse order to destroy those resources.  But if your team is good at Ansible, then it’s really a non-issue.  I can write a local provisioner in terraform but if my team doesn’t know HCL what’s the value? \n\nWe’ve had different professional services teams try and sell their best idea of provisioning and it all falls on deaf ears if it’s just one more thing the team needs to learn.  At the end of the day, provisioning clusters probably isn’t making the company any money.   Get them built as quick as possible the best way you know how and focus on whatever makes the company money.  Oh, and security…",

I’ve been in the cloud space for about a year now, and overall I have around 5–6 years of IT experience.\n\nIn the cert side, i have AZ-900, AZ-104, AZ-305, and AZ-400\n\nIn my current role I worked my way up to a medior level, but my real goal is to move into DevOps. I know that means I need solid Docker and Kubernetes knowledge, so I’ve started learning and practicing them in my limited free time. I’ve even built some small projects already.\n\nThe problem is that my current salary is around standard market level, which is great, but when I apply for DevOps roles, I usually run into two outcomes:\n\n1, I don’t even get invited to an interview,\n\n2, I get an interview, but they offer me about half my current salary because they would hire me as a junior DevOps engineer due to my lack of hands-on experience with Docker and Kubernetes.\n\nRight now I simply can’t afford to cut my salary in half. On top of that, my current company doesn’t really use Docker or Kubernetes, so I don’t have the chance to gain real work experience with them.\n\nI know the market is shit for switching jobs right now, but living in a country where salaries are already much lower than in most of Europe makes this even more frustrating. Honestly, it’s hard to see a clear way forward.\n\nWhat would you do in my situation? How would you successfully pivot into DevOps without taking such a big financial step back? Any advice would be really appreciated.",

For a long time I was also fixated on changing my job title to DevOps but in the end we're doing a lot of these things already. The team lead of our DevOps department wanted me over there because of my IaC and Kubernetes experience, but my manager blocked the move so I decided to look out and see what are my options.\n\nNext month I'm starting in another company as a Cloud Engineer again but with a 50% pay rise to what I'm currently getting. So my suggestion would be to not fixate so hard on the title, but the pay of it.\n\nYou already have strong experience and nice certifications. Get CKA and CKS maybe and you'll learn what you need about Kubernetes. Knock out Terraform Associate, it's pretty easy cert and with your experience you should get it in no time. \n\n  \nWhat I'm saying is look what's out there, As others have said you are already doing 80% of what a DevOps is and that's just a title with different responsibilites and meaning in each company. Look out for yourself and get a nice pay rise, ignore the title :)",

It serves as a searchable directory for high-quality opensource, but what I'm really proud of is the \"community curation\" type features (upvotes and discussions) to help surface the best projects. After a lot of hours I've managed to create a directory of 1028 opensource software.\n\nI've seen multiple other sites which have the same premise and all the GitHub Awesome Lists, but they lack in identifying if the repo is active, abandoned or just the general consensus of the OSS they have listed, the upvote system on this directory should really help show which OSS excel. I'm also working a deeper categorization system which shows alerts and highlights about the repos status , eg. whether the project is experimental, buggy/unstable, has a restrictive license or corporate influence.\n\nI've added a submission system so you opensource developers out there can list your projects.",

They can escalate to dev team on-call person for dev-related problems, but operators start first: server down, switch overloaded, interrupt storm in the kernel, etc. Devs don't need to have 20+ years of experience of those things to be good devs.\n\nIf operator sees that it's app misbehavior, s/he escalates, but with clear scope and without need to smack some poor ruby/go/rust/js developer with question on what is rcu_lock trace in the kernel and why process can't die when you send it SIGKILL and what is 'SFP slot 1 is overheating, shutting down' from igxbe, and why dbus restart was so bad and hurting.\n\nSame for devs. Putting operators into position to reason about why outer join on line 157 of the SQL query, constructed from BlissORM was a bad idea is unjust. They will learn, but devs are much more in position to know about it.\n\nSo, cooperation, but segregation. Ops are crawling in shell and enjoy hanged ssh due to MTU mistake, devs are in code, dealing with sudden breakage due to patch version update from dependency of dependency introducing quadratic complexity into o(n) algo.",

The Terraform vs Pulumi debate often comes down to whether you prefer HCL's declarative constraints or the flexibility of real programming languages. Both have their place\n\nYour point about PaaS solutions for early-stage teams makes total sense. We're seeing this a lot at Render too, teams that want to ship features fast without becoming infrastructure experts first. You get managed databases, auto-scaling, and built-in security without writing any IaC at all. Then as you grow and your needs get more specific, you can always add infrastructure-as-code on top or migrate to something more complex.\n\nThe Kubernetes-native tools you mentioned (Crossplane, ACK, etc.) are interesting for teams already committed to K8s, but that's a pretty heavy lift if you're just trying to get an app in front of users\n\nWhat infrastructure approach are you all currently using, and what's been the biggest pain point?",

Neither option is that wrong, though Pulumi might run out of funding faster than OpenTofu perhaps in a decade from now. That's too long to consider though. For what it's worth, both can reap the benefits of Claude Code just fine, so my advice is OpenTofu if you want to scale and definitely use AI (so long as you know what you're doing on paper and not just blindly letting Claude Code make services).\n\nI'm just now learning TF/OpenTofu but I started with Pulumi for a project because I heard loops were a nightmare in TF. I had a good understanding of AWS/GCP (where I used both and also needed to deploy to Oracle), and Claude Code helped me code the majority of the infra in Pulumi. I wouldn't say there were any bugs with Pulumi rather lots of niche, unknown AWS things that I couldn't figure out.\n\nI will say: Claude Code can be your friend for either option but only if you know all the basics of the AWS services and can choose which services to use by yourself without AI. Otherwise, it might hallucinate a little.\n\nI do think Pulumi offers something that made it appealing for a consulting shop making on-prem deployments on behalf of customers which was the Pulumi Automation API.\n\nI'm now learning TF and seeing if Claude Code works for it for a startup that doesn't need to deploy en masse and customized per customer, just normal service deployments. I think 95% of startups don't have a need that makes Pulumi worth it over TF.\n\nIf long-term alive-ness is the concern, and you don't have a need for the Automation API, then I would just use TF/OpenTofu because DevOps folks for hire generally only want to deal with TF since they're used to it. Obviously, your code base will be a mess since you're new, but folks you eventually hire tend to always fix things in subjective ways.\n\nWith all those Pulumi employees out on Reddit, I would assume one reads this, but having Pulumi infer what the problem is using an AI would be helpful. AWS doesn't give proper error messages, so you have to ask around and infer based on past issues why AWS is not working. But for what it's worth, Pulumi itself was never a problem.\n\nI will say the Pulumi slack is decently helpful. The community helped me figure out all those AWS issues and some Pulumi beginner issues. Just takes a few hours fwiw.",

Log analysis is nice as well, I hate looking through and grepping for errors in logs and trying to make sense of them. Ai does this pretty well. So find stuff you hate doing and make the ai do it. I'm faster to a solution now and colleagues that are not using it are falling behind. I think getting to know the ins and outs of your AI options will make you a better more marketable devops engineer. At least that's my experience.

Agentic AI allows for ai agents that can act on your behalf and eventually they'll be able read a jira identify the asks and purpose code or other fixes. If you start thinking about what your day to day is you start to realize there is a lot of it an AI can do faster. For now we need to guide it a bit but that won't last long. Once agentic AI starts becoming more autonomous we'll be asking it to work our ticketing queue for us and other tasks are similar. We can continue to add a meaningful impact by acting as a guide from an architecture stand point but beyond that ai will be faster and more capable than us in the not too distant future. It's not about me not automating my routine tasks, I've done that. It is about problems that come up. Upgrades and refactoring are super quick with AI. 0 day cve's could be addressed much more quickly with AI. Really, the question is what are you doing you think an AI couldn't do in 5 years. I can't think of much honestly. The only thing that limits ai is it's trained on us/the Internet so it's a good summary of all available knowledge. New novel ideas we can provide will make them better and it'll be interesting what AI will be able to do with new discoveries as well. We'll either have a better future where we can work on more human things or this will be used to enrich a few people and leave most of us with less. Time will tell. Anyways that's my take on it.",

They know that a lot of the AI tools that are out there are claiming to save money or make it easier to have a single person do more in the same amount of time by being more abstract across the process.\n\nIt's actually a good thing they are letting you analyze and figure out what tools and which processes could be optimized with more automation.\n\n  \nThat said, a lot of the important work that senior specialists do cannot be replaced with AI. Most of the AI tools out there are doing their best \"Google and Copy-paste from Stack Overflow\" impersonation, but I don't pretend I'm not doing the same thing. I'm not a specialist in writing infrastructure automation code, but I can use the LLMs to do the nitty gritty of generating the right syntax and then use my expertise to oversee, test, refine, secure, and make sure it's doing what I want it to do.\n\nFor my role I'm specifically using AI in these scenarios:  \n1. Error log analysis: Combing through logs is a pain, so I dump that stuff in an LLM and tell it to give me some things it thinks I should look into, along with likelihood of those paths having a successful resolve.  \n  \n2. Data analysis: I'm done pretending I know how to do Excel. I've been doing it 20+ years and still find it a pain everytime I'm trying to chart and analyze data. So I'm letting the machine figure out the best way to pull the data together in a way I want and present it for somebody else to consume in a report.  \n  \n3. Performance reviews: They want me to be more efficient, so I'm cutting down where I deliver least value. When I'm being asked to report on my accomplishments and what I did on a performance evaluation, I send the AI off into my status report updates to my manager to comb through all those emails and pull it out and put together something that seems reasonable (obviously reviewed and edited for hallucinations).  \n  \n4. Asking AI about why it sucks: In Visual Studio Code, depending on the model, I get varying results of whether it pays attention to MCP tools or Copilot instructions so I often interrogate it to learn better how to give those models what they need to do a better job. This allows me to share something with others so everybody on the team can work with the tools better.\n\n5. Research: I have access to a license for Office 365 Copilot so I use it's Research agent to go digging through the internet when I need to find a general recommendation for tool options, product comparisons, etc. By pulling together all the sources for me it's easier for me to get started on digging in.\n\n6. Code gen: The code generation is really good for established frameworks and languages. I find that most of the models tend towards older versions of the frameworks, so I need Cursor rules/Claude Skills/Copilot instructions to really give it the context about what tech to reference and where those docs are. \n\n7. Basic testing: AI can generate some useful tests to get you a bit of coverage so that you can spend time on the more complicated testing pieces. But I wouldn't trust auto-generated Jest unit tests to 100% validate an app. The models often forget to add new tests when you make app changes, or forget to update existing tests. Sometimes they will straight up remove tests that are failing because that will make it go green.",

I fed it the criteria of the review and had it build the results using Jira stories and my notes.

When me and the AI agree on something that it keeps forgetting, I tell the agent to add it to the instructions file so it doesn't forget. It works most of the time. When it doesn't work, I don't have to explain a lot to get it back on track. I just tell it to review the instructions before proceeding. \n\n> Code gen: The code generation is really good for established frameworks and languages.

Adding instructions to add tests when we modify things really has improved our testing.  Before a PR a prompt to update testing generally gets it rolling on adding new tests and updating existing tests. Even when it isn't quite right, it almost always finds the right places, so we can verify and fix without digging through mounds of code.",

A CS degree probably gave you solid fundamentals architecture, networking, OS concepts, etc. Also, plenty of DevOps engineers don’t work in the cloud at all.\n\nYou already have Linux and Bash, which is a strong base. Cloud is mostly just another abstraction layer: permissions become IAM, VMs become Compute Engine/EC2, and so on.\n\nBefore you jump into certifications, I’d honestly build a small homelab. Install Proxmox, then set up a few things, for example:\n\n\t•\ta NAS VM for storage\n\n\t•\tVMs for a Docker host, LDAP, Pi-hole\n\n\t•\ton the Docker host: Jellyfin/Plex, whatever you actually use\n\nOnce you’ve done it manually, you’ll naturally want to automate it. Start with templates, then move to Ansible + Git. Later you can replace more and more with Terraform (or at least use IaC principles), and you’ll learn the concepts way deeper.\n\nWhy? Because you’ll hit the same problems as in the cloud, just on a smaller scale:\n\n\t•\thow to manage access across machines\n\t•\thow to provision machines faster\n\t•\thow to optimize resources\n\t•\thow to standardize setups\n\nAnd yeah, you’ll probably end up writing some custom Python scripts once you start seeing opportunities.\n\nAI will replace “clickers.” I’ve met people who’ve been in cloud roles for years and still can’t do the basics underneath. And some companies will test that (e.g., “set up LDAP” or similar tasks), even if the job is cloud-heavy.\n\nInternal transfer is honestly one of the best paths so go for it like you said.

Manual testers often have a solid grounding in quality thinking, which aligns really well with DevOps because you’re already focused on finding issues early and improving reliability that’s a mindset, not just a job title.\n\nA few practical ways people make this transition smoothly:\n\n1) Leverage what you already know  \nYour Python, Linux, and shell scripting skills are real assets, they’re exactly the kind of automation foundation DevOps looks for. Many testers begin by automating test suites in CI/CD pipelines and that naturally evolves into owning delivery pipelines.\n\n2) Start with automation + CI/CD projects  \nSet up a small project (even on your own) that:\n\n* Builds via GitHub Actions/CI on every commit\n* Runs automated tests\n* Deploys to a staging environment That gives you practical pipeline experience interviewers love to see.\n\n3) Learn cloud and IaC incrementally  \nYou don’t need to know everything at once, focus on one cloud (AWS, Azure, or GCP depending on your company) and get comfortable with basic services + how to automate their provisioning (Terraform or managed stacks).\n\n4) Use your testing background as leverage  \nInstead of starting from scratch, frame your QA experience as quality assurance in delivery , DevOps values people who understand how to prevent regressions and improve pipeline confidence.\n\nOne pattern I see in successful transitions is turning every manual step you currently do into an automated, observable step ,that’s literally what modern DevOps delivery systems are built on.

      "text": "I worked as a frontend developer until last June. A friend told me about a devops opening in his Fortune 500 department. I wasn't interested at first because I preferred coding over managing Docker or K8s, but the salary hike and the big company experience were too good to pass up. He also persuaded me that they were using relatively new technologies and doing devops do no harm to my career. I almost missed the deadline, but the manager reopened the application just for me, which put a lot of pressure on me not to embarrass my friend during the hiring process.\n\nI heard from my friends that the current tech stack includes Sitecore, Azure, Cloudflare, Kubernetes, Docker, and SQL. They also used Terraform extensively. Since I had zero professional devops experience, I had to cram knowledge in two weeks. I would say for people like me AI would help a lot. I use Claude and Beyz coding assistant to help me understand complex concepts. Even with all that, I still had no confident in the interview. However, the actual interview was unexpected. The manager didn't do any code test and ask technical questions. He focused entirely on personality check, which is a little weird but after working with him for months I think it’s quite his personality. I think interview patterns totally depend on interviewers’ preference because the manager of another group require two code tests. When he asked what I value most, I told him about my learning trajectory: I went from a Chemistry degree to a Master’s in Power Electronics, then a second Master’s in Power Systems, and finally became a coder. I explained that switching fields and picking up new stacks is my core strength. I told him that I’m a quick study, but I’m definitely not into socializing. He gave a slow nod and just said \"Good\". After the interview, I just went back to my daily work. I didn't really expect much since I was honest about having zero experience. But I got the offer two days latter.\n\nNow that I’ve been on the job for about 6 months. I spent the early months learning while working, now I'm a little more comfortable. Unlike Frontend, where work ends when you close your IDE, DevOps is tied to release windows. Most of our releases happen after 7 PM. I do K8s cluster upgrades at midnight, which is a massive shift in work-life balance. For those who transitioned from Frontend to DevOps, I'd love to hear your reasons for making the jump and how you're feeling about the change now. ",

I don't want to expose it via Public LB as it incurs extra networking costs from AWS so I expose it privately ~~via private DNS~~.

I want to avoid the burden of maintaining self-signed TLS Certificates (public certificates cannot be generated for private dns records). So, I can make a public DNS resolving to private IP and generate public certificates with \\`Let's Encrypt\\` and live in peace (this private IP will be used to reach Rabbit from within AWS VPC)\n\n**Question**: Is it a good approach?

Users getting 5xx errors is always a problem.\n\nWe break it into three tiers. Page someone when users are affected right now. Slack notification when something needs attention today like a cert expiring in 14 days. Just log it when it's interesting but not urgent.\n\nThe other thing that took us years to learn is that if an alert fires and we consistently do nothing about it, we delete the alert. Alert fatigue is real and it makes you ignore the alerts that actually matter.\n\nWrote up the full 10-layer framework we use covering everything from infrastructure to log patterns.

(I Deffo want to re-write the service discovery bulletpoint, it comes across as low impact BS compared to the actual work done, and i want to be concise to keep it to one page)\n\nI have been getting interview calls and recruiters reaching out, but most of them tend to fall far below my comp range (Ideally 200k$+ and remote as a baseline, which as it stands is still a sizable paycut from my previous role). I've restarted the leetcode grind (Which hopefully I won't need to grind hards for serious Platform/DevEx roles) for some of the faang tier postings, but I don't think i'll apply to them for a few more weeks.\n\nEdit: Definitely need to fix grammar in quite a few places",

(Also a shitload of compliance, soc2/irap/hipaa/fedramp for said components)\n\nI'd appreciate further feedback if you get a moment\n\nWould highlighting heavy abstractions allowing dev teams to focus more on app code and offloading the rest to features provided by the \"platform\" work as a substitute?\n\n> distributed logging/tracing, did you make it easier for devs to adopt OpenTelemetry for example?\n\nAbstractions allowing Devs to pretty much toggle fluentbit, index and path to attach fluentbit sidecars to send applogs to a specific index  (we run daemonsets to collect all stdout to a different index). Unfortunately my org was very heavy into logs as metrics/everything **only** (shoot me kthx) and were really stubborn about it. Otel was something I was pushing for since we had a self host grafana setup && alloy, but between priorities and cost cutting, i never really got traction.\n\n>  did you build tools to make it easier for devs to onboard new applications into kubernetes (like app templates, manifests)\n\nHeavy abstractions with a lot of templating, a new dev team could add a dotnet service to the monorepo, add a few lines to their bazel file, and it would build a container and deploy it to a K8s cluster. Everything was abstracted away from them, with full flexibility to customize as much as they needed by adding to their simple yaml. (Keda, logging, ingress, storage, auth federation etc). \n\nOther examples would be custom CRDs written in go to simplify Vault auth && secret injections, setting up federated access to cloud resources (workload identity etc)\n\nIn retrospect, my resume does not go into any details about any of that, which I really should be adding. \n\nWould it make sense to consolidate the entire compliance aspect into one larger bullet and refine what i mentioned above into another point or two?\n\n\nAlso, what would you consider platform/dev-ex \n\nThe way I see it, its abstracting away pain points for devs so that they can focus on app dev, and not really give a shit about the underlying infra/things to get their app deployed to prod beyond things they really care about beyond a few lines of yaml. \n\nWe did not have an IDP, everything was mono-repo abstractions, setting up a new service was running a script that basically had a bunch of questions that would ultimately spit out a folder with most of the setup done",

I was recently (last month) offered a staff platform engineer position for 210k base comp. That seemed to be their high end too. You can definitely get there if you factor in 401k match/RSUs/bonus, but I’m not sure given the uncertainty of AI if I’d be willing to be someone making above the high end of the salary for an engineering job right now. The field is also getting more and more competitive at the high end, as there’s less emphasis on places to higher junior engineers anymore. If you really practice on what you wanna say in interviews and speak succinctly and confidently, at the staff level that will sell people. They want people who are self-motivated and can handle difficult projects without having to babysit. You also have to be great at working with other teams and working in areas you or no one else at the company may know and quickly become an expert at it. At this level it’s also how well you can market an idea and get other teams on board.",

You mention a lot about cost savings and some general job task you do, but nothing about specific projects. When you get to staff level, they want to know about how you manage projects, how you work with other teams, the thought process in considering what to deliver alongside cost/tech stack/consideration to the app team(s). \n\nAlso you will want to match key words found in each job description and weave those into your experience. The more tailored the resume is to that specific job the better. \n\nI disagree with those who say you do not have platform experience, as that name really encompasses so many things now. The bar for staff has also become lower (that or everyone is just sr/staff level now). It depends on the job description. If it matches what you’re good at, then the actual job title doesn’t mean anything. Platform, platform operations, cloud engineer, DevOps engineer, SRE … they’re interchangeable for a lot of the jobs I’ve seen over the last year, so just find jobs that match up with your experience and what you’re interested to grow in moving forward.",
