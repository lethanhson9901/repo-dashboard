I am not working anymore, I either use AI or when I start to use my brain, everyone around me answers with AI. I am not an angel, I am a junior that can’t learn properly because no one wants to, everyone wants AI and less human error.\n\nThe only thing it failed at was deep architecture like database migration and specific clustering, but everything else it simply just does it and when it doesn’t, we only have to do maybe a single thing to fix it. \n\nI am leaving the DevOps as a field and getting into security (was really interested in it before) but I genuinely feel like I was trolled and did nothing, and maybe even soon security would be replaced with AI.\n\nThis post may be stupid to seniors, but as a junior and people starting, this is reality. We don’t learn, we don’t grow, we are the ones getting replaced and I see no field being currently resistant to that. I will just get into moltbook and doom scroll.\n\nThank you for everyone who helped me pave my devops path, it is really one of the best fields I’ve ever went in and honored to have been here even if just for a short while, hopefully where I live is the problem and not the entire planet.",

IIIb approaches with no minimums, the pilot always needs to make the decision to land and to take over and fly the last 50+ feet of altitude. This is dependent on having a specific set of ground equipment, and dependent on having the airplane equipped with certain equipment like HUD technology. Not all airliners are equipped for no-minimum-RVR approaches. Takeoffs are dependent on the aircraft equipment, the airport, and the pilots. Some do it by hand some depend entirely on automation. \n\nWhat you’re talking about with captains and first officers is … not quite correct. There still being a difference between captains and first officers is an acknowledgement that in an emergency there can only be one person in charge. Back in the day, this would be a deference that was explicit - the captain was always in charge, and the first officer is an assistant. After a few horrendous air accidents caused by the person “in charge” being incorrect and also unable to be challenged, cockpit culture was changed by training something called “Crew Resource Management” which made it clear that everyone is required to speak up when something is wrong no matter the “rank” and that air crew should divide tasks and then work their assigned tasks. CRM is incredibly effective at preventing accidents and it’s notable where it breaks down like the runway excursion at Roanoke last year. It’s also one of the reasons that single pilot commercial flights are a bad idea. \n\nFirst officers are not “inexperienced” and in modern US airlines will have about 1500 hours in the cockpit with the engines on before they’re allowed to fly passengers, and will have dozens of hours of structured training in simulators and flying the actual airplane type under a check captain before they’re allowed to crew a regular flight. Using my sister as an example, she had 300 hours when she became a flight instructor, 1200 hours before working for a small regional airline, and over 2500 hours with the engines going round before she got a job at a main line. As a first officer, she now has over 3,000 hours in the type of aircraft she flies. Still a first officer. Keeping in mind that a pilot’s work day is typically double the flight time or more, that’s quite a lot of working time. \n\nThe things that create safety in airlines (multiple crew, defined roles, structured training) are the things that tech companies are saying it’s too expensive to do for our jobs.",

I remember seeing a comment once about how it’s not math until it has letters - and I’m sure a lot of people would insist at least half of them need to be Greek letters. 🤓\n\nBut more seriously as a math BS (so still very lightweight) I think the main characteristic of math is that it’s entirely about relationships. Relationships that can be rigorously proven with a small set of acceptable tools.\n\nArithmetic is important, and will always be important in many areas, but there’s a strong argument that people who would be naturally gifted in mathematics are driven away by the mindless drudgery of K-8 arithmetic. People should always be able to add 2 and 3 in their head but many of us think good estimation is more important once you get above 100 or so. E.g, seeing 27 x 414 should tell you the result will be around 30 x 400 or 12000 because you know how to round up or down appropriately. That may be good enough by itself, or at least you’ll know there’s a problem if the calculator gives you a wildly different number. In this case it’s 11,178, so the estimate is off by less than 7%. But if the result was 21,000 you know enough to double check the values you saw and the values typed into the calculator or spreadsheet.",

But cloud and k8s are layers of abstractions built upon the real networks and real hardware. And they bring more layers, take software defined networks, or virtual k8s clu sters, and so on.  \n\nAnd ultimately, when shit hits the fan and you have a real problem with networking in your virtual clusters, guess what -- they don't have the skills to debug it. Some folks are not even able to read through a man page nowadays.\n\nNow add AI on top of that, and you have a perfect recipe for disaster. \nOn the other hand, that's exactly why senior engineers with real skills just grin sarcastically when they hear that AI will take our jobs. \n\nAI is a great tool, but if you don't understand what you are doing it won't help you. People used to copy-paste complex bash one-liners without understanding them, now they produce whole codebases without a slightest hint of understanding how \"their\" code works.

The *old* kind. Servers, procedures, change requests, actual humans touching things. It wasn’t glamorous, but it worked. Then DevOps showed up with YAML, pipelines, and a moral superiority complex.\n\nSuddenly everything we did was “legacy.”  \nToo slow.  \nToo manual.  \nToo human.\n\nThey didn’t fire us right away. That would’ve been rude. Instead, they stopped hiring. Knowledge was “documented.” Processes were “automated.” Our experience was “captured.” Eventually, the only time anyone talked to us was when something broke in production and the pipeline didn’t know why.\n\nThen they fixed that too.\n\nNow the company doesn’t need people like me. Not because the work disappeared — but because DevOps decided it was inefficient for humans to do it. Everything is codified, templated, versioned, and enforced by tools built by people who never had to be on call when the tools fail.\n\nThe DevOps team insists this is progress. Fewer mistakes. Faster deployments. More reliability. And sure — it works. Mostly. Until it doesn’t. And by then, there’s no one left who actually understands the system end-to-end.\n\nI thought this was just my company being reckless. Then I talked to others. Same story everywhere. Different industries, same outcome. DevOps rolls in, replaces the old guard, calls it “modernization,” and moves on.\n\nI’m not an angel. I wasn’t a rockstar. I was just someone who expected experience to matter longer than a tooling trend.\n\nNow I’m not working anymore. Not because I refused to adapt — but because there’s nothing left to adapt *into*. The system doesn’t want people. It wants conformity.\n\nSo I’m leaving the field. Not because I hate it, but because I watched it erase an entire generation of workers and call it optimization. And now it’s shocked that no one’s left when things go sideways.",

But honestly, anyone who's worked with Terraform for a while knows that's just not true. The state file runs the show.  \n  \nNot long ago, I hit a snag with a team sure they’d locked down their security groups - because that’s what their HCL said. But they had a pile of old resources that never got imported into the state, so Terraform just ignored them. The plan looked fine. Meanwhile, the environment was basically wide open.  \n  \nWe keep telling juniors, “If it’s in Git, it’s real.” That’s not how Terraform works. What we should say is, “If it’s in the state file, it’s managed. If it’s not, good luck.”  \n  \nSo, does anyone else force refresh-only plans in their pipelines to catch this kind of thing? Or do you just accept that ghost resources are part of life with Terraform?",

The moment that Config has state, dependencies, and side-effects (like creating a Load Balancer triggering an ENI creation), it crosses the boundary into Code for me. It might not compile, but it sure can crash like code!",

From the architecture angle I've been pushing our common patterns to function more multi-regional as stand-alone rather than traditional patterns that rely on at least an eventual global sync.  Meaning each regional stack is the source of truth for its service coverage such that San Paolo data stays in San Paolo.  If Virgina's regional stack isn't going to use San Paolo's data then why pay the costs to send it.  Separate the \"global\" services like authentication, but keeping them out of the application stacks makes it much easier to do this for the meat of the estate.\n\nMy sell for this to the C level is mostly a data sovereignty compliance story (GDPR, etc) with some cost-savings sugar, but avoiding global syncs means those \"fully private and reliable connections\" across regions don't have to be nearly as reliable and privacy covered by encryption, meaning site to site VPN over public trunks is just fine.  It's certainly more complex to architect properly, but there's a lot of savings to be found pushing the work closer to the users and *not* treating it like one single app and single source of truth.\n\nMany in AWS might notice this pattern looks familiar...and that's because it's how almost everything is built at AWS with only a very few \"global\" exceptions.\n\nThis all results in me effectively sunkworking a secret playbook for the fall of the US empire in plain sight, masked by boring legal compliance and finops cover stories.  We're not there today, oh god no, but this is the horizon line I'm keeping my company's ship headed towards as much as my influence allows.",

The biggest challenge is the operational overhead self-hosted solutions require.  On the application side, it's fairly straightforward to do the migration, as long as you don't use any provider-specific functions and stick with some open standard, e.g. OIDC.\n\nIf anyone has a suggestion here, I'd love to learn more about EU-based auth providers.\n\nLambdas/serverless, while usually considered as a biggest vendor lock, are fairly easy to migrate comparing to identity services.",

You already tried running tests in parallel, which is the logical first step.   \n  \nThe second step is to detect flaky tests, and flag them accordingly, so you can skip them and fix them.\n\nA next step could be to map the coverage of your tests to your codebase, and only run the tests that are relevant to changes in your code.  \n  \nAnd finally, but this is more an advanced scenario, there are options to learn from historical test-runs and use this data with machine-learning systems to define what tests to run in what order, because you know from this historical test-run data, with a configurable Pxx signifance, that if test X fails, the other tests will also fail, and you can basically \"fail fast\" and skip all the \"downstream\" tests and fail the pipeline.   \n  \nDisclaimer: I work for CircleCI, one of the original global cloud-native CI/CD and DevOps platforms (we started just a few months after the first Jenkins release in 2011).

Also, a lot of times it helps to use a good APM tool to see where pipeline resources are really getting chewed up, something like CubeAPM can give you super granular insight into bottlenecks without breaking the bank on observability.

The good news is - with AI around, there is no more good reason to not have more unit tests. You have to tell the devs that they need to restructure the tests. If not, you will ask AI to mute their long running, flaky tests.\n\nRealistically, find out which are the slow tests are just ask the team to stop running them as part of the build. Also, they can consider running long, flaky test as a daily build on the most recent main code branch. This should not run part of the build process.\n\nHappy to share more info if you need it.",

Much less flakey.\n* Set and implement an aggressive flakey test detection and removal process. If a test is flakey, it's not testing what it is intending to test, therefore it's useless. You can have no confidence that a pass occurred because things worked correctly, it could just be something interfered in a particular way instead.You'll need to think about how it'll work best for you process wise. In the past we've tagged the developer that created the test, then a week later tagged the senior developer for that org, and then the week after that dropped it from the code base if it hasn't been fixed, and trusted the dev teams own code coverage requirements to ensure they get back to it (flakey means it's not *actually* testing the code, so code coverage reports were incorrectly claiming it was).\n* Automate a slow tests report, that publishes the top 10 slowest tests to a slack channel with the team. This one is fun, you can tell devs their tests are slow and they don't care. Posting it in a slack channel, even if you're not mentioning them by name at all, and suddenly they'll get embarrassed and go fix it (saw a 4 hour test time plummet to an hour and a half, with no loss of coverage, just through this alone!)\n* Identify the high value / high signal tests and move them into a separate batch that is executed first. The goal is to catch the major bugs quickly, not be comprehensive at this stage. Ideally this set needs to be regularly evaluated and adjusted so that you can keep the high quality ones here.",

They slimmed teams from 7 to 2 and people leaving are not replaced. That, while they expect to keep the same deadlines as before. I told them multiple times before and after the layoffs, stuff isn't going to finish on schedule, and before the layoffs they said they know. Well, f*cking own it now.  For such a company nobody wants to work overtime anyway, and people are outright demotivated. \n\nI've been searching for a role since November, but so far i'm only ghosted by recruiters and didn't even get to have 1 tech interview. I'm a DevOps with 20 years of experience and worked both as freelancer and permanent in the Netherlands.\n\nI think the dream job would be like Bernie Sanders said: if AI makes us so much more efficient, then agree to let people work less, for example 4 days work while keeping the same output. Not firing them and put all the pressure on the remaining people.\n\nAlso it's a myth that AI improves performance, in most cases it actually makes you slower: https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/11/ai_code_tools_slow_down/",

The AI hype that companies are using to cut costs, and the growing number of people training in computer science, definitely have something to do with it. Best of luck with your job search. \n\nHowever, I am fairly skeptical about the study you shared on AI reducing performance instead of improving it. That study is already over 6 months old, so it must have been done on late 2024 / early 2025 models. When you see the significant progress in models and tools over these last 6 months, and competent devs / ops who have completely changed their stance on AI during that period, I also think AI can genuinely accelerate one's productivity right now (at least it makes mine better on repetitive tasks).",

At the same time theres a pretty chunky oversupply of juniors which cant really be put to use as theres not enough capacity among existing seniors to actually train them into mediors/seniors.",

      "text": "Not sure if it's the best place to share this, but let's give it a try.  \n  \nA few years back, I was looking for a new job and managed to get an interview for a young SaaS startup. I wanted to try out their product before the interview came up, but, obviously, it was pretty much all locked behind paywalls.\n\nI was still quite junior at the time, working at my first job for about 2 years. We had a staging environment, so I wondered: maybe they do as well?\n\nI could have listed their subdomains and looked from there, but I was a noob and got lucky by just trying: [`app-staging.company.com`](http://app-staging.company.com)\n\nAnd I was in! I could create an account, subscribe to paid features using a Stripe test card (yes, I was lucky as well: they were using Stripe, as we did in my first job), and basically use their product for free.\n\nThis felt crazy to me, and I honestly felt like that hackerman meme, even though I didn’t know much about basic security myself. I’ll let you imagine the face of the CEO when he asked me if I knew a bit about their product and I told him I could use it for free.\n\nHe was impressed and honestly a bit shocked that even a junior with basic knowledge could achieve this so easily. I didn’t get the job in the end, as he was looking for an established senior, but that was a fun experience.\n\nIf you want to know a bit more about the story, I talk about it in more detail here:  \n[https://medium.com/@arnaudetienne/is-your-staging-environment-secure-d6985250f145](https://medium.com/@arnaudetienne/is-your-staging-environment-secure-d6985250f145) (no paywall there, only a boring Medium popup I can’t disable)",

At minimum: separate auth (SSO or VPN, or at least IP allowlists), separate Stripe project or sandbox with clear flags, and a big visual banner so screenshots and links don’t leak and confuse everyone.\n\n\n\nI also like treating staging URLs as secrets in themselves: no obvious app-staging.\\* patterns, and auto-expiring preview environments per PR. Tools like Cloudflare Access and Tailscale make it pretty painless, and I’ve used Snyk plus Pulse for Reddit and Datadog to catch when those staging quirks start leaking into user-facing issues or public chatter. The main point: if it’s on the internet, someone’s going to poke it, even if they’re “just a candidate.",

If your outage is scheduled and communicated the impact on your users is minimal and you’ll get a lot less heat than if it goes down by accident. \n\nYou’re also likely making half that. \n\nIf nothing else a situation like this is an easy combo with higher ups to effectively get on yourself, “give me 6 months and I’ll cut the cost in half, I want a a full months worth of savings as a bonus or a title bump/promotion to DevOps Architect or whatever. You can be a superstar if you save the company anywhere near a quarter mil a year. \n\nThis isn’t experienced devs so I won’t harp on you too much but at this point you should have been able to understand the existing architecture to at least have an idea of what can safely be turned off, spun down, or migrated. \n\nAnd you can’t be this worried about taking down prod. From feature flags to full blue/green rollouts, robust testing and monitoring all the info and lessons learned are out there to absorb and implement. \n\nFrankly if you were brand new there’d be little better a situation to step in where you can immediately demonstrate your exact dollar value to the company.",

If you really want to make a strong resume learn the following: Linux, terraform, kubernetes, troubleshooting and any cloud provider service architectures. Get CKAD, terraform associate certifications (believe me they're not easy). And then you can go for automation projects in python/go/any scripting language for that matter. You can build small automation that spins up a kubernetes cluster, spins up certain number of pods, imports defined container image into the pods and start running it as an application. If you want to go for advanced project, you can define scaling and pod-to-pod connectivity. Just this...and that will be enough. Half of the devops engineer in this world don't know everything. I myself learnt kubernetes once I started working as devops engineer.",

      "text": "Hey folks,\n\nI’m curious how other teams handle time-bound assets in real life. Things like:\n\n* TLS certificates\n* API keys and credentials\n* Licenses and subscriptions\n* Domains\n* Contracts or compliance documents\n\nIn theory this stuff is simple. In practice, I’ve seen outages, broken pipelines, access loss, and last minute fire drills because something expired and nobody noticed in time.\n\nI’ve worked in a few DevOps and SRE teams now, and I keep seeing the same patterns:\n\n* spreadsheets that slowly rot\n* shared calendars nobody owns\n* reminder emails that get ignored\n* “Oh yeah, X was supposed to renew that”\n* \"There is too much tools for that and people don't communicate properly on the new time-bound assets or the new places where they are used\"\n\nSo I wanted to ask the community:\n\n**How are you handling this today?**\n\nSome specific questions I’m really interested in:\n\n* Where do you store expiration info? Code, CMDB, wiki, spreadsheet, somewhere else?\n* Do you track ownership or is it mostly implicit?\n* How far in advance do you alert, if at all?\n* Are expirations tied into incident response or ticketing?\n* What’s broken for you today that you’ve just learned to live with?\n\nI’m especially curious how this scales once you’re dealing with:\n\n* multiple teams\n* multiple cloud providers\n* audits and compliance requirements\n* people rotating in and out\n\nIf you’ve had a failure caused by an expiration, I’d love to hear what happened and what you changed afterward, if anything.\n\nContext: I’m a DevOps engineer myself. After getting burned by this problem a few too many times, I ended up building a small tool focused purely on expiration lifecycle management. I won’t pitch it here unless people ask. The goal of this post is genuinely to learn how others are solving this today.\n\nLooking forward to the war stories and lessons learned.",

Each vendor has its own model, its own UI, its own APIs (or lack of them), and its own ideas of what “best practice” means. At scale, that turns into constant rework: SAML certs, CI/CD tokens, API keys, any kind of digital assets, all expiring on different clocks and breaking different parts of the stack.\n\nAutomation helps a lot, but only per vendor and per integration. You still end up needing a global view that answers “what is expiring soon, where is it used, and who needs to act”, otherwise you just move the fire drills around instead of eliminating them.\n\nu/badaccount99  Funny thing is, that “let’s form a company” line is basically how this whole discussion started for me. I hit that exact wall internally and ended up building [TokenTimer.ch](http://TokenTimer.ch) to at least handle the visibility and ownership side. It doesn’t magically automate every renewal, but it *does* help answer “what’s expiring, where, and who needs to deal with it” before everything breaks at once.",

The script runs weekly with a warning threshold of 30 days, so app owners get at least 4 email warnings before their stuff expires. Our ops team gets the consolidated weekly report, and they open incident tickets whenever they see a new entry pop up (ensuring further follow-up until app team resolves the incident). Keep in mind some of our secret refresh is automated, but this catches all of the other stuff that can fall through the cracks.\n\nIn our case I wanted the source of truth to be the secrets themselves, so I don't have some separate silo of information to keep in-sync.

If you want to tinker with a bigger VM for testing or need a GPU, you can just start a VM in the UI that is sized for your workload.\n\nThe organization can manage templates and security much better since the IT admin stays in control of the infrastructure.

Also, if you have any IO intensive apps (literally anything using Node.js because of `node_modules`), you will have to make sure developers clone repos inside of volumes inside of your Docker Engine VM (VS Code and JetBrains both support it). Otherwise, you will be bind mounting your files from the host into the VM and get really bad IO performance. \n\nFor remote, Codespaces will probably be the best experience if you already use Github.

You could set up Puppet to control configs, and don’t grant the users sudo, but they could still install local packages. You could mount $HOME with noexec, but that doesn’t stop passing scripts to an interpreter outside of $HOME. Basically, to really stop someone determined, you’ll need SELinux or AppArmor.\n\nAn easier solution would be to have ephemeral VMs (which sounds an awful lot like a container), with $HOME mounted to a network share, or at least a persistent disk. Let people experiment as they see fit in the VM, but make it very clear that every night / weekend (whatever makes sense for your work), everything not in $HOME goes away, so they **must** have dependencies properly saved, etc.\n\nEven then, you *still* run the risk of someone creating a special snowflake with a shell script that they run after every reset, but at that point, it’s more of a personnel issue rather than a technical one.\n\nYou might also consider CI being the ultimate arbiter. If a build doesn’t pass in CI, with an agreed-upon and controlled environment, *it doesn’t pass.* It’s then up to the devs to figure out what drift they’ve introduced. This is a platonic ideal that is unlikely to work in reality, though, because as soon as product heard that “[Dev]Ops is slowing velocity,” you have a fight that you are unlikely to win.",

      "text": "We’ve put a lot of effort into observability over the years - metrics, logs, traces, dashboards, alerts. From an engineering perspective, we usually have good visibility into what’s happening and why.\n\nWhere things still feel fuzzy is translating that information to non-engineers. After an incident, leadership often wants a clear answer to questions like “What happened?”, “How bad was it?”, “Is it fixed?”, and “How do we prevent it?” - and the raw observability data doesn’t always map cleanly to those answers.\n\nI’ve seen teams handle this in very different ways:\n\ncurated executive dashboards, incident summaries written manually, SLOs as a shared language, or just engineers explaining things live over zoom.\n\nFor those of you who’ve found this gap, what actually worked for you?\n\nDo you design observability with \"business communication\" in mind, or do you treat that translation as a separate step after the fact?",

Are the hours making you questioning your life choices etc. I'm looking to hearing genuine personal opinions. \n\nI have a networking background and I currently work as a network engineer. I have several Cisco, AWS and Azure certifications and I have been doing this for a while. I fell in love with networking instantly and I still love it to this day. However it's a lot of the same and I have to travel/be away from my family more than I'd like. I have diagnosed ADHD which I am medicated for and it's been a blessing in my life. However, it's no secret that we get extra bored of repetitive tasks if there's nothing new and exciting. \n\nHere I feel like the DevOps career is something that could be right up my alley, the amount of knowledge you need to have to just get started, the constantly changing environment, the never ending learning and the fact that there always seems to be something to do. Please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nI am now legible for a \"scholarship\" of sorts to get a 2 year DevOps education for free and I wonder if you'd take that chance if it was you? I was super excited until I realised that I have barely done any coding and sure there's courses in coding covered in this education but there are also many other things. But since I have experience in other things covered I could focus more on the coding aspect. Do you think two years will be enough experience to get into a junior DevOps role without being a burden to said company?\n\nThank you for your time.\n\n/M",

With job layoffs and AI automation being hot right now, the stability is an unknown. \n\n\nFrom a technical perspective, things move much quicker now than it used to. For you personally with your background, you could have a big advantage over someone who jumps straight into DevOps with no background. We are expected to deal with anything that comes our way and networking and sysops experience helps with that a lot. \n\nTo be a high earner now, you are expected to know software engineering, and most high earnings companies expect former SE levels. \n\nThere is so much that depends on the company you work for, since DevOps and platform engineering vary as much as the title engineer does. If you work for a company that treats DevOps as an engineering discipline, you will be treated like an equal. For most, you are a support org, so you can be treated similarly to help desk or app support. \n\nThere's so much more I could say, but there's a lot of variables.",

The symptom of a software development team without dedicated infra guy is always the same: they burn a lot of money by (1) using the cloud inefficiently (2) accumulating massive technical debt in their automation — or not having automation at all.\n\nSo, I think we can be called by different names in the future (Platform / Cloud / Site Reliability / Infrastructure Engineers - no one really likes the term \"DevOps,\" TBH), but our profession is far from being redundant for years to come.\n\nGood luck with whatever path you decide to pursue!",

And everyone wanted to do it including company's that never really understood what it's about. Roll forward years and it's suddenly a role being hired for. The danger is as the term drops out of trend the roles dry up.\n\nAnd a new term comes along. \"Platform\" Engineering is often the new term these days! \n\nAs a former Director I explicitly avoided DevOps engineer roles when forming hiring plans. Instead looking for Software Engineers that were able to work across the stack and understood DevOps. We'd focus on skillset in terms of gaps in the team. \n\nPersonally, if working with software, I'd keep levelling up my coding skills and find a place where they practice DevOps as part of software delivery. This is the space I work in. \n\nOr if more on the Ops side, you're likely looking for somewhere that runs k8s (so more likely a larger / enterprise company - startups and even SMEs shouldn't really be touching it). Such roles may still be called \"DevOps\". But also look for Cloud Engineer roles or Platform roles.",
