      "text": "I wrapped up a tech panel for a Principal Azure Engineer role at an investment bank a couple of hours ago. This followed an interview with the hiring manager last Wednesday. We know each other from the past, i.e., I’ve interviewed for multiple roles at this firm over the last 5-6 years.\n\nThis role landed on my LinkedIn feed randomly. I commented on the post and emailed the hiring manager directly, we had a short back-and-forth, and his recruiter called me almost immediately. The process has been unusually smooth by modern standards.\n\nToday’s panel felt strong. I’m confident I cleared the bar with both the Azure SME and the hiring manager. I saw visible agreement on several answers, got verbal acknowledgment more than once and handled questions from a junior panelist with ease. I was told that I’m “first in line” (not sure if that means FIFO or first on the shortlist), however,  it seemed to be directionally positive.\n\nHere’s the problem: I was laid off a little over six months ago and I am EXHAUSTED. It's like I've been on the hamster wheels of interviews since 8/4/2025. I’ve done the prep, the loops, the panels, the follow-ups. I know I’m good enough to be gainfully employed as a DevOps engineer.\n\nIf this role doesn’t turn into an offer, I’m seriously questioning whether I want to continue in tech at all. I don’t know if I have it in me to keep doing 5–7 round interview gauntlets, only to be rejected for vague reasons like “culture fit” or not smiling enough. I’ve given my adult life to STEM / engineering / corporate IT / tech and I am exhausted from having to engage with recruiters who want someone to take managerial roles for IC level pay.\n\nI’m not bitter about rejection. I’m tired of dysfunction...hiring managers who don’t know the difference between EC2 and AWS Lambda, recruiters who can’t distinguish an AWS account from an Azure subscription and BS interview processes that ding candidates for being \"too intense\".\n\nSo I’m asking honestly: when is it time to walk away?\nFor those who’ve been at a similar crossroads...did you step back temporarily, change strategy or leave tech altogether?\n\n\nTL;DR: Six months, countless interviews, strong signals in today's tech panel. If today's tech panel doesn’t result in an offer, I’m seriously considering being done with the tech interview industrial complex.",

Pay them for their services.\n\nFar too many times I've seen good staff be let go because 'budget' or they don't fit the band, you lose far more searching for replacement, training and finding those skills in multiple other contractors or employees. New staff is good, new skills sets and fresh eyes, but some employees you don't let go over small amounts of money when they bring far more value.",

We were getting ready to release Cassandra 5 (I'm a committer) so I just did sessions about it, and it got a surprising amount of interest. I wrote my own tooling to provision database environments and it includes a lot of performance analysis tools, so I would show people how to understand how the DB behaves.  \n\nRegarding interviewing, after speaking at a conference Microsoft asked me to interview for a principle engineer position to run the Cassandra fleet.  Want to know how many database questions they asked me in my interview?  Zero. Instead they asked me to write shortest path in Java in a Google doc.  I haven't needed to even think about that in 20 years. I found it was easier to just have fun doing what I like instead of trying to conform to what an employer wanted me to be.  I absolutely *hated* working in big tech.  Now I'm working on stuff I actually love working on, because I get to make all my own decisions and do exactly what I want, whenever I want.\n\nI won't say it's easy, but it's rewarding if you can muscle through it. Find a niche you enjoy, talk about it, become relevant.  Make it easy for people to find you. \n\nGood luck.",

Six months of interviews means six months of proving yourself to people who can't tell EC2 from Lambda. That energy could go into building something that proves your value without a panel deciding if you smiled enough. Consulting, contract work, building in public. Anything where YOUR work speaks instead of your performance in a 45 minute behavioral round.\n\nThe best move I ever made was realizing that the traditional hiring path isn't the only path.

Cancelled my lease, moved in with parents, and spent a lot of time trying to pivot into global markets (a lot of SEO, outreach.. BS, boxed wine) but it wasn't very fruitful.\n\nI ended up getting back into traditional employment, but if I had to do it again I would double down on local gig economies and traditional marketing. It felt like I was giving back to my community, making a difference, and seeing the product from start to finish.

No one cares about the true workload of MLOps, and more importantly, the underlying DevOps.

If someone is working in the water industry and doing integration we dont call it waterops.\n\nWhat are you are doing is just SWE work, nothing wrong with it really but it goes past the entire point of MLOps. \n\nMLOps is also a broad field, but for someone like me who has the title, I go all the down to how does our RDMA Networking interface with our MPI Code, what's the best scaling strategies? Whats the best auto-training and auto-feature selection strategies being automated? How does the model be robust enough to last 20 years without any human interference? How are you selecting your hardware based on your ML types? How are you selecting your storage? Is everything I am doing regarding this completely reproducible? Is everything I am doing completely auditable? \n\nLike things like model registry irk me, like someone never consulted what was actually running in production. Model registry and versioning for models would never work for someone like me, who has 15mil models running everyday. What does work is reproducible and storing what actual changes were made to the model.\n\nA lot of things you talked about in the post, could be done by devops person, there is no ML focus to what you have talked about apart from your software being a ML Product.\n\nThis isnt meant to be offensive to you, but a lot of people miss the ML part of MLOps. And IMO unless you know how to do the entire model from scratch ie be a machine learning engineer, you shouldnt pick up the title of MLOps",

One of my favorite questions to ask in interviews is “what capabilities do your SRE’s unblock or improve for the business that would suffer if you didn’t have them?” depending on how they answer I might ask follow up questions or move on entirely (because it’s an intentionally loaded question).\n\nI’ve gotten a lot of interesting and revealing questions from companies that in a couple of cases gave enough of a smell to decline the role. \n\nOf course this is a lot easier to do when you’re already employed and can be a bit picky, which I understand isn’t always the case, but still a worthwhile question.",

We felt exhausted, and we all started looking for other roles. In the end, all it took was just hiring a couple more engineers so everyone would have time to experiment and improve every week.

The fake one had a postinstall hook that tried to exfil environment variables.\n\nI asked our security team what we do about this. They said use npm audit. npm audit only catches KNOWN vulnerabilities. It does nothing for zero-days or typosquatting.\n\nSo now I'm sitting here with a script took me months to complete that scans packages for sketchy patterns before CI merges them. It blocks stuff like curl | bash in lifecycle hooks ,Reading process.env and making HTTP calls ,Obfuscated eval() calls and Binary files where they shouldn't be and many more\n\nWorks fine. Caught the fake package. Also flagged two legitimate packages (torch and tensorflow) because they download binaries during install, but whatever just whitelist those.\n\nMy manager thinks I'm wasting time. \"Just use Snyk\" he says. Snyk costs $1200/month and still doesn't catch typosquatting.\n\nAm I crazy or is everyone else just accepting this risk?\n\nTool: [https://github.com/Otsmane-Ahmed/ci-supplychain-guard](https://github.com/Otsmane-Ahmed/ci-supplychain-guard)",

Your script checks what packages *do* at install time. Completely different problem.\n\nWhat you built is behavioral analysis at the install boundary. That's a better approach for supply chain attacks than any vulnerability scanner. Pair it with a registry proxy (Artifactory, Nexus, even Verdaccio) so nothing gets installed without going through your chokepoint, and you've got a stronger setup than most teams paying for Snyk.\n\nThe whitelist for legit binary-downloading packages is fine too.

The typosquatting vector alone has caught multiple supply chain attacks in the wild (event-stream, ua-parser-js, etc). Snyk and npm audit catch things after they are in the advisory database — your scanner catches the patterns before anyone has reported them.\n\nA few things that helped us:\n\n1. Socket.dev — does static analysis of packages before install, catches typosquatting and suspicious behavior patterns. Way cheaper than Snyk and specifically designed for this problem.\n\n2. Lockfile auditing in CI — diff the lockfile on every PR. New dependency additions should be reviewed like code changes, not rubber stamped.\n\n3. npm config set ignore-scripts true globally, then whitelist the packages that legitimately need lifecycle hooks. Most packages do not need postinstall. The ones that do (native addons, some binary downloads) can go on an explicit allow list.\n\nYour manager saying just use Snyk is like saying just use a firewall and not bothering with access controls.

We're essentially looking for red flags in the maintenance history for the project or sometimes in the code itself. Humans are imperfect humans but the ones following best practices are less likely to become the weak leak leading to distribution of an exploit. We aren't at this time code-reviewing or running any static-code-analysis on these libraries, although it's not a terrible idea in principle. We have other things on the radar targeting this risk, like going all in on devcontainers so untrusted code is isolated in a container on the developer workstation, and getting in place a separate internal package registry for production along with a process for vetting and promoting specific builds of dependencies.\n\nThat, and good backups. Immutable backups, specifically. The thing you hope you'll never need, but will allow you to tell ransomware perpetrators to fuck off while rebuilding infrastructure from IaC and loading backups.\n\nWhether what you're doing is \"wasting time\" depends on the security stance in your organization which is up to technical leadership. Do the perceived risk of not using this outweigh the cost of maintaining it? Does the organization have the collective expertise to maintain an internal security scanning tool vs getting the best available existing coverage off the shelf? Security decisions are rarely black/white, but mitigation of security risk is a task that truly has no \"completed\" state so the business has to decide what is \"enough\".",

      "text": "So I'm a freelance developer and have been doing this now for 4-5 years, with half of my responsibilites typically in infra work. I've done all sorts of public/private sector stuff for small startups to large multinationals. In infra, I administer and operate anything from the single VPC AWS machine + RDS to on-site HPC clusters. I also operate some Kubernetes clusters for clients, although I'd say my biggest blindspot is yet org scale platform engineering and large public facing services with dynamic scaling, so take the following with a grain of salt.\n\nNow that I'm doing this for a while, I gained some intuition about the things that are more important than others. Earlier, I was super interested in best possible uptimes, stability, scalability. These things obviously require many architectural considerations and resources to guarantee success. \n\nNow that I'm running some stuff for a while, my impression is that many of the services just don't have actual requirements towards uptime, stability and performance that would warrant the engineering effort and cost. \n\nIn my quest to simplify some of the setups I run, I found what probably the old schoolers knew all along. Systemd+Journald is the GOAT (even for containerized workloads). I can go some more into detail on why I think this, but I assume this might not be news to many. Why is it though, that in this subreddit, nobody seems to talk about it? There are only a dozen or so threads mentioning it throughout recent years. Is it just a trend thing, or are there things that make you really dislike it that I might not be aware off?",

And now, suddenly, it's easier to throw everything into Kubernetes. Running things as systemd units loses a lot of its luster when you already have a kubernetes cluster laying around. And then it's easier to monitor those things in kubernetes if you use the Prometheus metrics stack because you automatically get metrics endpoint monitoring via the Prometheus ServiceMonitor CRD. And then it's easier to collect logs out of your applications because you likely already have something like Alloy/Vector/Promtail shipping kubernetes logs to a centralized logging database. And then it's easier to set up networking/DNS records because you likely already have an Ingress Controller to make your workloads reachable to the outside world, External-DNS to create your DNS records, and then instead of setting up certbot as yet another systemd unit to generate your TLS certificates you have something like cert-manager already in the cluster that will do it for you. And then instead of using something like monit to toggle your systemd units when they fail (as yet another systemd unit), you just have kubernetes doing that with its builtin container restarting behavior.\n\nI hear people call it resume driven systems admin, when it's really just kind of not true. It's ignoring how much Kubernetes ecosystem tooling does for you, that you aren't quantifying when you just say \"this could be a systemd unit.\" More like \"this could be a whole collection of systemd units, terraform, Ansible, and templated out service config files.... or just one Dockerfile and Helm values file.\" There just is no such thing as a good faith discussion about Kubernetes that starts off with \"this could just be a systemd unit\" because at that point you've already told a lie.",

I'm not burnt out at the moment, but I wonder as I sit here and let Claude write an entire Python script to make some quick backend changes to a couple dozen Github repos (that management requested this morning but apparently needed two weeks ago), what's next? The story seems to be the same everywhere I go: A) join promising startup, do interesting work for a few years, C-suite cycles out, company either crashes, spins it's wheels for another few years, or we get acquired, or B) come close to jumping off a bridge studying for big tech roles, only to get to the final round to be told, \"hey, we were just kidding about full remote the three times you asked us, we need you in [insert city 1000 miles away here with a 2.5x CoL]\". If the market was better I'd start pivoting towards full on software engineering, but alas, many of our glorious technological leaders decided it was a good idea to cozy up to whatever governmental facade of the time would give them quick quarterly wins and over-gorged shareholders, so here we are.\n\nFor those of you older DevOps folk that successfully escaped and made career transitions without taking huge hits to your comp, what are you doing these days? Are you happy (or at least content)? Do you have regrats? \n\nA quick search seems like a lot of the threads asking these questions as of late are from AI doomers (which you know, understandable, I get it and hate it... but damn does it make reading Terraform docs so much easier) and folks unknowingly knee deep in a burn-out cycle; I want to hear from people that took the plunge and are happy with it, or at the very least, content not being in Cloud Infrastructure.",

Take 1 small project on weekends (10-15h/week). Price it at 1.5x your hourly rate. If you land 2 consistent clients, then make the jump. Biggest surprise for me are not technical skills. It's learning to scope work and say 'no' to bad-fit clients. I probably turned down 30% of inquiries last year.

The isc2 ccsp is worth picking up and pickup some cloud service provider certs from ms/aws - these would all compliment the devsecops space.  At that point i am sure you would find yourself being a real bridge between swe and csec/infosec teams and could probably move into the appsec space.  From there look at going for the cissp which is an absolute monster to slay ( well worth it though).  Then maybe add something ln the risk management space like maybe the crisc or one of the isaca certs.\n\nOnce you do make the move you will still find yourself drawing on your swe/devsecops experiences.\n\nJust remember what most ppl and textbooks miss thr point on.  Csec is about protecting people.  One of the ways we protect them is by protecting their data - but there are many other dimensions which aren't just about protecting data.  You will find people in the OT space who will really get this because,  well lets just say fail fast and fail early and having defective sodtware sure as f*ck doesn't fly when you have say a ventillator doing your breathing for you.\n\nThe cissp exam is a really interesting experience.  Because the subject matter is so broad,  its an adaptive test so if you get a question wrong it will start asking more questions on that area to shake you down.  \n\nHope this helps",

One went into consulting for small companies that can't afford a full DevOps hire, works maybe 25 hours a week and makes roughly the same.

Yet I care less by the day. Once I have permanent residency I’ll start being more ballsy with pushback on dumb things, and eventually I’ll be fired and open up a French fry food truck or something with an American flag in a foreign land.

I’ll never work for a company that hires in India ever again either. Every US employee hates them for being snakes and scammers, and if the economy wasn’t shit, many of us would have walked out sooner. I’m tired boss.

The contradiction dissolves once you realize we're not choosing between \"all cloud\" or \"all on-prem\" anymore—we're building hybrid stacks out of necessity. K8s actually makes that mess manageable, which is probably why adoption keeps climbing even as repatriation does.\n\n  \nThe $600B capex bet is wild though. Hyperscalers are banking on AI inference costs dropping dramatically once they hit scale, but they're currently losing money on every workload. That only works if they either (a) crush operating costs through automation, or (b) charge enough to make margin when their utilization finally maxes out. Neither is guaranteed.\n\n  \nWhat actually kills me is watching teams self-host inference on cheaper hardware and getting better latency + cost than cloud pricing. That trend alone might explain the repatriation spike better than any compliance story.",

Replace ~~code~~ edit:docs with working code whenever possible. Deduplicate documentation as vigorously as you do your code. Hyperlink aggressively. Basically, systematically remove documentation that has the potential to rot.\n\nAs a really simple example, I like to replace \"getting started\" docs with a makefile. A makefile can be relatively high level, so it can somewhat serve as documentation. More importantly though, if the makefile (read: documentation) is wrong, it breaks and needs to get fixed. If it were regular documentation and it would break (i.e. be incorrect), then it really *doesn't* force you to fix it. So it often goes unfixed.",

The ones that get tested during incident response stay accurate. The ones that only get opened during onboarding rot because nobody feels the pain of them being wrong until the new hire is already confused.\n\nThe \"as little as possible\" point is underrated too.

When your prod deploy fails at 2am because some upstream Helm repo is having an outage, you'll wish you had vendored. With ArgoCD specifically, you can use a Helm chart repository as a source but pin to exact versions. The middle ground that works well: keep your Chart.yaml with dependencies pointing to upstream repos, but commit the charts/ directory (the output of helm dependency build). That way you have the full source vendored for reliability, but the Chart.yaml still documents where it came from and what version you're on. Run helm dependency update in CI periodically to check for new versions. For the security angle, Renovate or Dependabot can watch your Chart.yaml and open PRs when new chart versions drop, so you get visibility into updates without manually checking.",

Vendoring full charts is a maintenance trap — you end up with massive diffs on every upstream update that nobody actually reviews.\n\nThe unavailable-repository fear is real though. Two approaches depending on scale:\n\n**Small team**: Just keep a `Chart.lock` with version + SHA. If the upstream disappears, you have the exact version to hunt down or reconstruct. Most major charts (prometheus, ingress-nginx, grafana) are on multiple mirrors.\n\n**Larger org**: Run a ChartMuseum or Harbor instance as a pull-through cache. Every chart you reference gets cached automatically. Nexus works too if you already have it for other artifact types. This also gives you an audit trail of which chart versions ever entered your cluster.\n\nWith ArgoCD specifically, the source hydrator feature someone mentioned is great for this — it renders to static manifests at sync time, so even if the chart repo is gone, your last-synced state is preserved as plain YAML in git. Best of both worlds: you get the ergonomics of Helm templating with the auditability of committed manifests.",

          "text": "For production with ArgoCD I would avoid pulling charts dynamically from public repos without pinning versions.\n\nWhat we typically do is reference the chart in Chart.yaml with an exact version and mirror that chart into an internal Helm repository or artifact registry. That way ArgoCD is not dependent on an external repo being available at deploy time.\n\nVendoring the entire chart source into Git works, but it becomes painful when upstream releases frequently. You end up spending more time syncing chart updates than actually managing your configuration.\n\nKeeping Chart.yaml plus values.yaml in Git and mirroring the chart artifact internally gives you reproducibility without cluttering your repo.\n\nIf your concern is immutability, version pinning and internal mirroring usually solves that without full vendoring.\n\nAre you running into availability issues with public repos or more worried about supply chain control?",

With a single branch it's easy. Every commit merged into the mainline branch is built and stored as an artefact. Then when it's time to release, you take the commit you want to release, give it some reference (usually either a tag or a short-lived release branch) and your CD pipeline will promote that artefact through your environments. With multiple environment branches like how you've described it's much harder, because they're being merged into each other all the time and it's impossible to know which of those merge commits you need to be building as the release candidate.",

We use a git repo for this but there are other ways.\n\n3) If we need to hotfix we start by creating a hotfix branch from the tag that's being patched, then adding commits to that hotfix branch.  Once done, we cherry-pick the patches back to main if applicable.\n\nThe goal is to ensure that what we test in everyone environment is also what we promote; we never build again to promote.  If a version fails testing, it just never goes beyond that environment. We could remove those artifacts but we generally don't.",

      "text": "I work at a mid-sized AEC firm (\\~150 employees) doing automation and computational design. I'm not a formally trained software developer - I started in a more traditional domain expertise role and gradually moved into writing C# tools, add-ins, and automation scripts. There's one other person doing similar work, but we're largely self-taught.\n\nOur file infrastructure runs on a Linux Samba server with 100TB+ of data stored serving all 150 + maybe 50 more users. The development workflow that existed when I started was to work directly on the network drives. The other automation developer has always done this with smaller projects for years and it seemed to work fine.\n\n**What Happened**\n\nI started working on a project to consolidate scattered scripts and small plugins into a single, cohesive add-in. This meant creating a larger Visual Studio solution with 30+ projects - basically migrating from \"loose scripts on the network\" to \"proper solution architecture on the network.\"\n\nOver 7-8 days, the file server experienced complete outages lasting 30-40 minutes daily. Users couldn't access files, work stopped, and IT had to investigate. IT traced the problem to my user account holding approximately **120 simultaneous file handles** \\- significantly more than any other user (about 30).\n\nThe IT persons sent an email to my manager and his boss saying that it should be investigated what I'm doing and why I could be locking so many files basically framing it as if I am the main cause of the outages. The other cause they have stated is that the latest version of the main software used in the AEC field (Autodesk Revit) is designed to create many small files locked by each individual user which even though true, to me sounds like a ridiculous statement as a cause for the server to crash.\n\nShould a production file server serving 200 users be brought down by one user's 120 file handles? I've already moved to local development - that's not the question. I want to understand whether I did something genuinely problematic or the server couldn't handle normal development workload. Even if my workflow was suboptimal, should it be possible for one developer opening Visual Studio to bring down the entire file server for half an hour? This feels like a capacity planning issue.\n\nHere's how they announced their discovery of the cause of the crashes to management with the email they sent:\n\n>After analyzing the logs, it was determined that one specific user (UID ...) was causing repeated server crashes.\n\n>Here is what the data shows for today between 16:34 and 17:04:\n\n>Time  \nNumber of Locks  \nAction  \n16:36  \n117  \nTerminated  \n16:38  \n116  \nTerminated  \n16:40  \n119  \nTerminated  \n16:42  \n114  \nTerminated  \n16:44  \n113  \nTerminated  \n16:46  \n112  \nTerminated  \n16:48  \n111  \nTerminated  \n16:50  \n115  \nTerminated  \n16:52  \n110  \nTerminated  \n16:54  \n108  \nTerminated  \n16:56  \n111  \nTerminated  \n16:58  \n137  \nTerminated  \n17:00  \n110  \nTerminated  \n17:02  \n108  \nTerminated  \n17:04 hours  \n108  \nTerminated  \n15 times in 30 minutes the system has terminated this user's session, but every time he reconnects and creates over 100 locks.\n\n>A normal user creates 5-20 locks.

The real question IT should be asking is why their file server has no connection limits, no resource quotas per user, and apparently no monitoring that would have caught it before a 30-40 minute outage. A properly configured Samba instance handles thousands of concurrent handles without breaking a sweat. You were right to move to local dev, but don't let them frame this as your fault.

That approach only works if the tool is very fast though (I use ruff which can lint and format my entire python repo in 2 seconds). This has helped me with the annoying feedback loop of committing, waiting 5 minutes, everything is green except the formatter, then needing to wait for everything again. \n\nYou mentioned having Snyk as a CI check, which stood out to me. Does this only check new dependencies you added in that PR, or check for vulnerabilities in existing packages? I could imagine a frustrating situation where some CVE comes out on an existing package, and then you can’t merge an emergency fix for a prod issue because you now need to also update the dependencies.\n\nPersonally I prefer using Snyk asynchronously. I set up a GitHub Actions cron to run “Snyk monitor” on the repo every night at 2am. We get weekly emails from Snyk with updates about any new vulnerabilities.",

      "text": "Mitchell Hashimoto got tired of watching open-source maintainers drown in AI-generated pull requests. So he built [Vouch](https://github.com/mitchellh/vouch), a contributor trust management system. The concept is almost absurdly simple: before you can submit a PR to a project using Vouch, someone already trusted has to vouch for you.\n\nThe whole thing lives in a single text file inside the repo. One username per line. A minus sign means denounced. You can parse it with grep.\n\nSigstore verifies artifacts. SLSA verifies builds. Dependabot checks dependencies. None of them answer the question of whether a given person should be contributing to a project at all. That's the gap Vouch fills: contributor trust, not artifact trust.\n\nHashimoto designed it the same way he designed Terraform. Declarative. Human-readable. Version-controlled. Instead of .tf files for infrastructure, you get .td files for trust. Same brain, different domain.\n\nThe xz-utils backdoor is the elephant in the room. \"Jia Tan\" spent two years earning trust through legitimate contributions before planting a CVSS 10.0 backdoor. Vouch wouldn't have stopped that attack. But the vouch record would've been visible in the git history, who vouched for them, when, and the denouncement would propagate to every project subscribing to that vouch list. Less of a lock, more of a security camera.\n\nGhostty is already integrating it. The repo picked up 600 stars in three days. A GitHub staff member commented on the HN thread saying they'd ship changes \"next week.\"\n\nThe concerns are real though. Gatekeeping is the obvious one. Open source is supposed to be open, and Vouch creates an explicit barrier where there wasn't one before. One HN commenter called it \"social credit on GitHub.\" The persona gaming problem hasn't gone away either; someone could still spend months building trust before going rogue.\n\nHashimoto himself flags it as experimental. But it's the first serious attempt at making contributor trust visible and version-controlled.\n\nI wrote up the full breakdown, including how Vouch compares to PGP's web of trust, Advogato, and Debian's maintainer process, [here](https://extended.reading.sh/vouch-pull-request) if you want the deep dive.",

Prior to this shift, I didn't handle heavy coding or application deployment logic. I’ve tried to be cooperative and learn fast to not be a bottleneck, but I'm struggling.\n​Legacy Nightmare: We took over a tech stack from a previous company that is incredibly messy, complicated, and unstructured.\n\n​Zero Delegation: Tasks aren't delegated well. I’m suddenly solely responsible for big features and deployments. If something breaks (frontend or backend), I have to front the issue and fix it alone.\n​I feel like I'm doing the work of a Lead Dev, a Senior DevOps, and L3 Support all at once. Is this level of scope creep normal for a Senior role, or am I being taken advantage of?\n\nNot much helping direct to your title but just as a person experiencing transition. Just a personal opinion, this experience helped me open my eyes on management, which can be nasty and pressuring, yet some soft skills to talk with internal management and to external management.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI recently reformatted my machine and realized how tedious it is to manually install Homebrew, configure Zsh, set up git aliases, and download all the necessary SDKs (Node, Go, Python, etc.) one by one.\n\nTo solve this, I built `mac-dev-setup` – a shell script that automates the entire process of bootstrapping a macOS environment for software engineering and DevOps.\n\n**Repo:**[https://github.com/itxDeeni/mac-dev-setup](https://github.com/itxDeeni/mac-dev-setup)\n\n**Why I built this:** I switch between an older Intel MacBook Pro and newer M-series Macs. I needed a single script that was smart enough to detect the architecture and set paths correctly (`/usr/local` vs `/opt/homebrew`) without breaking things.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* **Auto-Architecture Detection:** Automatically adjusts for Intel (x86) or Apple Silicon (ARM) so you don't have to fiddle with paths.\n* **Idempotent:** You can run it multiple times to update your tools without duplicating configs or breaking existing setups.\n* **Modular Flags:**\n   * `--minimal`: Just the essentials (Git, Zsh, Homebrew).\n   * `--skip-databases`: Prevents installing heavy background services like Postgres/MySQL if you prefer using Docker for that (saves RAM on older machines!).\n   * `--skip-cloud`: Skips AWS/GCP/Azure CLIs if you don't need them.\n* **DevOps Ready:** Includes Terraform, Kubernetes tools (kubectl, k9s), Docker, and Ansible out of the box.\n\n**What it installs (by default):**\n\n* **Core:** Homebrew, Git, Zsh (with Oh My Zsh & plugins).\n* **Languages:** Node.js (via nvm), Python, Go, Rust.\n* **Modern CLI Tools:** `bat`, `ripgrep`, `fzf`, `jq`, `htop`.\n* **Apps:** VS Code, iTerm2, Docker, Postman.\n\n**How to use it:** You can clone the repo and inspect the code (always recommended!), or run the one-liner in the README.\n\nBash\n\n    git clone https://github.com/itxDeeni/mac-dev-setup.git\n    cd mac-dev-setup\n    ./setup.sh\n    \n\nI’m looking for feedback or pull requests if anyone has specific tools they think should be added to the core list.\n\nHope this saves someone a few hours of setup time!\n\nCheers,\n\nitzdeeni",
