I collected all that plus other questions that I found on glassdoor, blind etc in a github repo. I've added my own video explanations to solve those questions. \n\nit's free and I hope this will help you to prepare and pass. If you ever feel like thanking me just Star the repository.\n\nhttps://github.com/devops-interviews/devops-interviews ",

We know each other from the past, i.e., I’ve interviewed for multiple roles at this firm over the last 5-6 years.\n\nThis role landed on my LinkedIn feed randomly. I commented on the post and emailed the hiring manager directly, we had a short back-and-forth, and his recruiter called me almost immediately. The process has been unusually smooth by modern standards.\n\nToday’s panel felt strong. I’m confident I cleared the bar with both the Azure SME and the hiring manager. I saw visible agreement on several answers, got verbal acknowledgment more than once and handled questions from a junior panelist with ease. I was told that I’m “first in line” (not sure if that means FIFO or first on the shortlist), however,  it seemed to be directionally positive.\n\nHere’s the problem: I was laid off a little over six months ago and I am EXHAUSTED. It's like I've been on the hamster wheels of interviews since 8/4/2025. I’ve done the prep, the loops, the panels, the follow-ups. I know I’m good enough to be gainfully employed as a DevOps engineer.\n\nIf this role doesn’t turn into an offer, I’m seriously questioning whether I want to continue in tech at all. I don’t know if I have it in me to keep doing 5–7 round interview gauntlets, only to be rejected for vague reasons like “culture fit” or not smiling enough. I’ve given my adult life to STEM / engineering / corporate IT / tech and I am exhausted from having to engage with recruiters who want someone to take managerial roles for IC level pay.\n\nI’m not bitter about rejection. I’m tired of dysfunction...hiring managers who don’t know the difference between EC2 and AWS Lambda, recruiters who can’t distinguish an AWS account from an Azure subscription and BS interview processes that ding candidates for being \"too intense\".\n\nSo I’m asking honestly: when is it time to walk away?\nFor those who’ve been at a similar crossroads...did you step back temporarily, change strategy or leave tech altogether?\n\n\nTL;DR: Six months, countless interviews, strong signals in today's tech panel. If today's tech panel doesn’t result in an offer, I’m seriously considering being done with the tech interview industrial complex.",

Pay them for their services.\n\nFar too many times I've seen good staff be let go because 'budget' or they don't fit the band, you lose far more searching for replacement, training and finding those skills in multiple other contractors or employees. New staff is good, new skills sets and fresh eyes, but some employees you don't let go over small amounts of money when they bring far more value.",

We were getting ready to release Cassandra 5 (I'm a committer) so I just did sessions about it, and it got a surprising amount of interest. I wrote my own tooling to provision database environments and it includes a lot of performance analysis tools, so I would show people how to understand how the DB behaves.  \n\nRegarding interviewing, after speaking at a conference Microsoft asked me to interview for a principle engineer position to run the Cassandra fleet.  Want to know how many database questions they asked me in my interview?  Zero. Instead they asked me to write shortest path in Java in a Google doc.  I haven't needed to even think about that in 20 years. I found it was easier to just have fun doing what I like instead of trying to conform to what an employer wanted me to be.  I absolutely *hated* working in big tech.  Now I'm working on stuff I actually love working on, because I get to make all my own decisions and do exactly what I want, whenever I want.\n\nI won't say it's easy, but it's rewarding if you can muscle through it.

Obviously the reverse isn't good either(great social skills, lots of fluff on resume, lying about projects or how much they helped in said project, etc) \n\n\nedit: also to clarify, when I say \"social skills\" I don't mean how well you can present or lead a retro. I basically mean do you come off warm/friendly? Folks wouldn't be intimated to ask you a question? You can have back and forth feedback/discussion on ideas, problems & solutions without being flustered etc. I suck at presentations and avoid them when I can lol...\n\nThat's the only thing that comes to mind when someone says they get a lot of interviews, make it to the technical/final round but haven't landed anything.

You're tired of the hiring theater around tech. Those are two very different things.

Six months of interviews means six months of proving yourself to people who can't tell EC2 from Lambda. That energy could go into building something that proves your value without a panel deciding if you smiled enough. Consulting, contract work, building in public. Anything where YOUR work speaks instead of your performance in a 45 minute behavioral round.\n\nThe best move I ever made was realizing that the traditional hiring path isn't the only path. It's just the default one.\n\nHope you get this offer though. Sounds like you earned it.",

BS, boxed wine) but it wasn't very fruitful.\n\nI ended up getting back into traditional employment, but if I had to do it again I would double down on local gig economies and traditional marketing.

Audit logs got the 12-month retention or whatever they required.

We hash the request ID and sample deterministically so you can still trace a specific request if needed.\n\n3. **Pre-filter before shipping** - We run a lightweight log processor on the app server that drops known noise (health checks, bot requests, etc.) before sending to our log aggregator. Cuts volume by ~40%.\n\n4. **Retention tiers** - Hot logs (7 days) in fast storage, warm logs (30 days) in cheaper storage, cold logs (90+ days) in S3/GCS with Athena/BigQuery for occasional queries.\n\nWhat's your current stack?

Thats why storage ends up costing more than the servers.\n\nFew things that helped me\n\nSelf hosting your observability stack (Grafana + Loki + Prometheus, or SigNoz as an all in one Datadog replacement) saves a ton but now youre babysitting more services. Worth it if you have the bandwith.\n\nSwitching to a platform that bundles observability into compute cost was the bigger win for me. I moved to Quave ONE and the built in Grafana dashboards, ingress metrics grouped by path/status/response time, app logs with search and WAF logs just come included. No agents, no collectors, no seperate bill. Covers like 80% of what I was paying Datadog for. Railway and Render have some built in metrics too and Coolify is solid if you want full self hosting on your own VPS.\n\nIf youre staying on Datadog/New Relic at least look at Grafana Cloud, free tier is surprisingly generous (50GB logs, 10k series) and paid is way cheaper per GB. Also ask your vendor about committed use discounts, most people dont and leave money on the table.\n\nThe logging hygene advice everyone else gave is real but if your setup is structurally designed to charge you twice for everything no amount of sampling fixes the underlying problem.",

If someone is working in the water industry and doing integration we dont call it waterops.\n\nWhat are you are doing is just SWE work, nothing wrong with it really but it goes past the entire point of MLOps. \n\nMLOps is also a broad field, but for someone like me who has the title, I go all the down to how does our RDMA Networking interface with our MPI Code, what's the best scaling strategies? Whats the best auto-training and auto-feature selection strategies being automated? How does the model be robust enough to last 20 years without any human interference? How are you selecting your hardware based on your ML types? How are you selecting your storage? Is everything I am doing regarding this completely reproducible? Is everything I am doing completely auditable? \n\nLike things like model registry irk me, like someone never consulted what was actually running in production. Model registry and versioning for models would never work for someone like me, who has 15mil models running everyday. What does work is reproducible and storing what actual changes were made to the model.\n\nA lot of things you talked about in the post, could be done by devops person, there is no ML focus to what you have talked about apart from your software being a ML Product.\n\nThis isnt meant to be offensive to you, but a lot of people miss the ML part of MLOps.

The fake one had a postinstall hook that tried to exfil environment variables.\n\nI asked our security team what we do about this. They said use npm audit. npm audit only catches KNOWN vulnerabilities. It does nothing for zero-days or typosquatting.\n\nSo now I'm sitting here with a script took me months to complete that scans packages for sketchy patterns before CI merges them. It blocks stuff like curl | bash in lifecycle hooks ,Reading process.env and making HTTP calls ,Obfuscated eval() calls and Binary files where they shouldn't be and many more\n\nWorks fine. Caught the fake package. Also flagged two legitimate packages (torch and tensorflow) because they download binaries during install, but whatever just whitelist those.\n\nMy manager thinks I'm wasting time. \"Just use Snyk\" he says. Snyk costs $1200/month and still doesn't catch typosquatting.\n\nAm I crazy or is everyone else just accepting this risk?\n\nTool: [https://github.com/Otsmane-Ahmed/ci-supplychain-guard](https://github.com/Otsmane-Ahmed/ci-supplychain-guard)",

Lockfile auditing in CI — diff the lockfile on every PR. New dependency additions should be reviewed like code changes, not rubber stamped.\n\n3. npm config set ignore-scripts true globally, then whitelist the packages that legitimately need lifecycle hooks. Most packages do not need postinstall.

Humans are imperfect humans but the ones following best practices are less likely to become the weak leak leading to distribution of an exploit. We aren't at this time code-reviewing or running any static-code-analysis on these libraries, although it's not a terrible idea in principle. We have other things on the radar targeting this risk, like going all in on devcontainers so untrusted code is isolated in a container on the developer workstation, and getting in place a separate internal package registry for production along with a process for vetting and promoting specific builds of dependencies.\n\nThat, and good backups. Immutable backups, specifically. The thing you hope you'll never need, but will allow you to tell ransomware perpetrators to fuck off while rebuilding infrastructure from IaC and loading backups.\n\nWhether what you're doing is \"wasting time\" depends on the security stance in your organization which is up to technical leadership. Do the perceived risk of not using this outweigh the cost of maintaining it? Does the organization have the collective expertise to maintain an internal security scanning tool vs getting the best available existing coverage off the shelf?

Not that big of a deal but enabled across 40 accounts with a lot more resources got pretty expensive. \n\nSelf hosted SharePoint because someone wanted a promotion ended up costing almost 450k usd a year and the migration is probably well over 1.5m in resource hours to actually migrate it over. It’s taken almost 2 years with a bunch of people working on it. \n\nAutomated EBS snapshot cleanup with life cycling saved almost 750k usd a year deleting old backups. \n\nThat’s just stuff I can think of off the top of my head while I sit with my new born baby at 3am lmao",

Since I put devsecops on my CV suddenly not getting no interviews. I Thought the fact I brought security skills would help get me hired because my CV IS 90% devops 10% security but for someone reason no roles which I’m not used to.\n\nI would like to ask any devops leads firstly what are you looking when hiring right now (my experience multi cloud, terraform, docker, kubernetes, helm, GitHub argoCD, python, Prometheus, ELK stack, CKAncert) obviously to go into what I done with these would be long but what are you guys looking at when you look at CVs?\n\nSecondly don’t think the devsecops is harming my CV?\n\nThanks ",

          "text": "Hiring should typically pick up in a few months. I don’t think putting devsecops on your resume necessarily hurts unless you’re making that your main focus and roles hardly mention anything security related on them. \n\nCloud skills will always be the most glaringly relevant thing most folks look at first(aws, gcloud or azure experience) since majority of the time you’ll be working in one of those three. Although there are some companies that still host their own hardware and run k8s. \n\nI personally prefer someone with a relatively short resume. Where the initial summary and past few jobs aligns with skills we’re looking for in our job posting. \n\nThats enough to get a phone screen anyways. The phone screen is really the “important” part to getting further in the process since it’s easy to weed out if your resume is fluff or not. \n\nObviously having a prior connection that works on the team and would recommend you is by far the best route…I don’t think I’ve seen a scenario the candidate didn’t make it through and it’s how I’ve been hired and have hired former coworkers. (Assuming the connection worked with them for a decent amount of time and highly recommends them, not a hand wavey, they were decent type remark)\n\nSome companies are also just bad at taking down “ghost postings” where that position has been filled already yet they send the generic “not a fit for us” email anyways.\n\nLastly I will add…soft/social skills matter now more than ever. You can check the box on all the skills and experience need but another canidiate might have a bit less experience or hasn’t worked exactly in the same stack we are. 9/10 we’re still gonna hire the person who doesn’t seem like an asshole to work with and knows how to communicate effectively, especially if it’s a remote position. \n\nI get the vibe from a lot of postings recently that just having the skills and experience is enough. Maybe for some places where you’re just a cog in the wheel but how you interact is heavily judged and accounted for. When i show up to work it’s enojyable to work with peers who are not only smart but dont come off abrasive/condescending or just straight up rude. Id rather hire a junior i can train up then a senior with that personality imo. (Not saying this is you just in general)",

When a security alert fires, pull the 5-minute window around it and suddenly you see the full picture - what was deploying, what endpoints were hot, whether latency was already degraded.\n\nThe expensive-but-works answer is Datadog Security Monitoring + APM (or Elastic SIEM + APM). They handle correlation natively. Budget version is Grafana + Loki + Falco - works great but you build the glue yourself.\n\nBiggest lesson: do not try to build one unified dashboard.

When something changes, the safest option becomes another meeting to rebuild context.\n\nTeams that invest in structured documentation (clear process ownership, decision logs, ADRs tied to actual systems) tend to reduce this overhead.

Replace ~~code~~ edit:docs with working code whenever possible. Deduplicate documentation as vigorously as you do your code. Hyperlink aggressively. Basically, systematically remove documentation that has the potential to rot.\n\nAs a really simple example, I like to replace \"getting started\" docs with a makefile. A makefile can be relatively high level, so it can somewhat serve as documentation. More importantly though, if the makefile (read: documentation) is wrong, it breaks and needs to get fixed. If it were regular documentation and it would break (i.e. be incorrect), then it really *doesn't* force you to fix it. So it often goes unfixed.",

The ones that get tested during incident response stay accurate. The ones that only get opened during onboarding rot because nobody feels the pain of them being wrong until the new hire is already confused.\n\nThe \"as little as possible\" point is underrated too.

It's like \"Ansible, for people\" - you build a plan, turn it into an executable runbook and track progress on a real-time dashboard as the work actually happens.

I ran through that carousel.\n\n  \nOne thing that bothered me the most were companies that without warning - would put me in a coding challenge.  Sure, it's expected.  It's part of the job.  But lately? They're giving me SDE level challenges.  Hash tables are one thing, but linked lists? Binary Search? The last interview I had my jaw dropped.  It was painfully difficult. They wanted me to solve a problem involving ping pong balls in a room of x size.  I was floored.  Second challenge - fix a kubernetes manifest issue.  Easy peasy in my book.  No problem.  But oh, what's this? the configmap has a python script thats... 300 lines long? And it's broken? So now I have to debug and fix it as well? All this in 15 mins? Oh, look here.  It's using a redis package.  Great, I haven't touched the redis package in months.  A lot of these methods called are vaguely familiar and some i've never used.  Can I look at the official docs? No? Why not? Oh, because in the real world, engineers don't consult docs on the internet.  Sorry. My bad. \n\n  \nAbsolute insanity.  At one point I just started laughing mid interview. I knew I was cooked.  When I had a call with the recruiter after, he was insanely apologetic.  I told him to put a note down that any other candidate going through these interviews should basically be an SWE.  My way of giving the next person a massive heads up.\n\nI had to do double takes and re-read the job descriptions. Amazingly, the job descriptions all involved: IaC, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Observability, Scaling Systems, Reliability engineering... you know.. Devops stuff.  \n\nI wonder - is this becoming the norm now? Are the skills I have just misaligned and not really DevOps? Interviews like this make me feel like a fraud, tbh.  It's like all the experience I have building infrastructure, scaling systems, writing operators, hammering away at terraform means nothing to these companies.  They just want a SWE that does infra.\n\n",

Multiple long-lived branches are being more and more considered an anti-pattern these days.\n\nYou need an immutable commit ref from which you can build a release candidate. With a single branch it's easy. Every commit merged into the mainline branch is built and stored as an artefact. Then when it's time to release, you take the commit you want to release, give it some reference (usually either a tag or a short-lived release branch) and your CD pipeline will promote that artefact through your environments. With multiple environment branches like how you've described it's much harder, because they're being merged into each other all the time and it's impossible to know which of those merge commits you need to be building as the release candidate.",

Tag the docker image or “has this code changed” logic to be the SHA256 sum of all the directories and one off files (Directory.build.props and global.json I am looking at you). Then tag based off that dir hash. I encourage you not to hash the whole repo - only hash files that deploy with your product. For example, .gitignore and tests rarely affect the product, so exclude those from the dirhash logic.\n\nThis provides a deterministic way to say “has this code been built before, and if so fetch that version.” We did this all the time at Blackboard and it worked quite well for a lot of different code repositories.\n\nThis also survives rebases and cherry picks since you’re no longer depending on the git SHA.\n\nFor python we use Dirhash, I believe bash and other languages have very similar libraries.",

Some rules I just find to be pedantic and not helpful, so bring this up with your team and tweak it. \n\nSome checks, like autoformatters, I have run automatically as a pre-commit hook. That approach only works if the tool is very fast though (I use ruff which can lint and format my entire python repo in 2 seconds). This has helped me with the annoying feedback loop of committing, waiting 5 minutes, everything is green except the formatter, then needing to wait for everything again. \n\nYou mentioned having Snyk as a CI check, which stood out to me. Does this only check new dependencies you added in that PR, or check for vulnerabilities in existing packages? I could imagine a frustrating situation where some CVE comes out on an existing package, and then you can’t merge an emergency fix for a prod issue because you now need to also update the dependencies.\n\nPersonally I prefer using Snyk asynchronously. I set up a GitHub Actions cron to run “Snyk monitor” on the repo every night at 2am. We get weekly emails from Snyk with updates about any new vulnerabilities.",

Prior to this shift, I didn't handle heavy coding or application deployment logic. I’ve tried to be cooperative and learn fast to not be a bottleneck, but I'm struggling.\n​Legacy Nightmare: We took over a tech stack from a previous company that is incredibly messy, complicated, and unstructured.\n\n​Zero Delegation: Tasks aren't delegated well. I’m suddenly solely responsible for big features and deployments. If something breaks (frontend or backend), I have to front the issue and fix it alone.\n​I feel like I'm doing the work of a Lead Dev, a Senior DevOps, and L3 Support all at once. Is this level of scope creep normal for a Senior role, or am I being taken advantage of?\n\nNot much helping direct to your title but just as a person experiencing transition.

      "text": "Mitchell Hashimoto got tired of watching open-source maintainers drown in AI-generated pull requests. So he built [Vouch](https://github.com/mitchellh/vouch), a contributor trust management system. The concept is almost absurdly simple: before you can submit a PR to a project using Vouch, someone already trusted has to vouch for you.\n\nThe whole thing lives in a single text file inside the repo. One username per line. A minus sign means denounced. You can parse it with grep.\n\nSigstore verifies artifacts. SLSA verifies builds. Dependabot checks dependencies. None of them answer the question of whether a given person should be contributing to a project at all. That's the gap Vouch fills: contributor trust, not artifact trust.\n\nHashimoto designed it the same way he designed Terraform. Declarative. Human-readable. Version-controlled. Instead of .tf files for infrastructure, you get .td files for trust. Same brain, different domain.\n\nThe xz-utils backdoor is the elephant in the room. \"Jia Tan\" spent two years earning trust through legitimate contributions before planting a CVSS 10.0 backdoor. Vouch wouldn't have stopped that attack. But the vouch record would've been visible in the git history, who vouched for them, when, and the denouncement would propagate to every project subscribing to that vouch list. Less of a lock, more of a security camera.\n\nGhostty is already integrating it. The repo picked up 600 stars in three days. A GitHub staff member commented on the HN thread saying they'd ship changes \"next week.\"\n\nThe concerns are real though. Gatekeeping is the obvious one. Open source is supposed to be open, and Vouch creates an explicit barrier where there wasn't one before. One HN commenter called it \"social credit on GitHub.\" The persona gaming problem hasn't gone away either; someone could still spend months building trust before going rogue.\n\nHashimoto himself flags it as experimental. But it's the first serious attempt at making contributor trust visible and version-controlled.\n\nI wrote up the full breakdown, including how Vouch compares to PGP's web of trust, Advogato, and Debian's maintainer process, [here](https://extended.reading.sh/vouch-pull-request) if you want the deep dive.",

I needed a single script that was smart enough to detect the architecture and set paths correctly (`/usr/local` vs `/opt/homebrew`) without breaking things.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* **Auto-Architecture Detection:** Automatically adjusts for Intel (x86) or Apple Silicon (ARM) so you don't have to fiddle with paths.\n* **Idempotent:** You can run it multiple times to update your tools without duplicating configs or breaking existing setups.\n* **Modular Flags:**\n   * `--minimal`: Just the essentials (Git, Zsh, Homebrew).\n   * `--skip-databases`: Prevents installing heavy background services like Postgres/MySQL if you prefer using Docker for that (saves RAM on older machines!).\n   * `--skip-cloud`: Skips AWS/GCP/Azure CLIs if you don't need them.\n* **DevOps Ready:** Includes Terraform, Kubernetes tools (kubectl, k9s), Docker, and Ansible out of the box.\n\n**What it installs (by default):**\n\n* **Core:** Homebrew, Git, Zsh (with Oh My Zsh & plugins).\n* **Languages:** Node.js (via nvm), Python, Go, Rust.\n* **Modern CLI Tools:** `bat`, `ripgrep`, `fzf`, `jq`, `htop`.\n* **Apps:** VS Code, iTerm2, Docker, Postman.\n\n**How to use it:** You can clone the repo and inspect the code (always recommended!), or run the one-liner in the README.\n\nBash\n\n    git clone https://github.com/itxDeeni/mac-dev-setup.git\n    cd mac-dev-setup\n    ./setup.sh\n    \n\nI’m looking for feedback or pull requests if anyone has specific tools they think should be added to the core list.\n\nHope this saves someone a few hours of setup time!\n\nCheers,\n\nitzdeeni",

The problem: we hit ~$8k/mo and it kept climbing with every new service.\n\nPrometheus + Grafana + Loki works great if you have a platform team to maintain it. We didn't -- Thanos for HA alone ate a week of eng time every quarter. And the point about locking yourself out of logs during an outage (mentioned above) is real. We learned that the hard way.\n\nThe middle ground is where it gets interesting now. Grafana Cloud gives you managed Prometheus without the ops burden. SigNoz and OneUptime are solid open-source options if you want to self-host but don't want to glue together 4 different systems. OneUptime specifically bundles monitoring + logs + on-call + status pages, which helped us also kill our PagerDuty and Statuspage bills.\n\nMy advice: if your team is < 5 eng, the operational overhead of DIY Prometheus will eat you alive. Either go managed (Grafana Cloud) or pick something unified. If you have a dedicated platform team, Prometheus + Grafana is hard to beat on flexibility.",

The decision really comes down to: **Do you value control or convenience?**\n\n**Prometheus → Datadog reasons:**\n- **Alert fatigue** - Prometheus alerting config is YAML hell. Datadog's UI makes complex alert logic (multiple conditions, anomaly detection, forecast alerts) way easier.\n- **Unified observability** - Having metrics + logs + traces in one platform simplifies correlation. With Prometheus you're stitching together 3-4 tools (Prom + Loki + Jaeger/Tempo).\n- **Managed infrastructure** - Not dealing with Prometheus HA, TSDB sizing, retention management. This matters more as you scale.\n- **Query language** - PromQL is powerful but cryptic. Datadog's query builder + saved views are more accessible for non-SRE teams.\n\n**Datadog → Prometheus reasons:**\n- **Cost explosion** - Datadog pricing scales brutally with custom metrics and log volume. We hit k/month and realized 70% was log ingest we didn't need.\n- **Vendor lock-in** - Moving off Datadog is painful (all dashboards/alerts need rebuilding). Prometheus + Grafana is portable.\n- **Control** - Prometheus + long-term storage (Thanos/Cortex/Mimir) gives you full data ownership and infinite retention if needed.\n- **Cardinality limits** - Datadog has strict limits on tag cardinality. Prometheus handles high-cardinality metrics better (until you hit storage issues).\n\nHybrid approach we ended up with: Prometheus for metrics (self-hosted with Mimir for long-term storage), Datadog for logs and APM only.

Pipelines that worked fine suddenly break because you cant install debugging tools, cant troubleshoot in production, cant do basic system tasks without a shell.\n\nThe problem is security team wants minimal images with no vulnerabilities but dev team needs to actually ship features without spending half their time babysitting Docker builds. We tried multi-stage builds where you use Ubuntu or Alpine for the build stage then copy to distroless for runtime but now our CI/CD takes forever and we rebuild constantly when base images update.\n\nAlso nobody talks about what happens when you need to actually debug something in prod. You cant exec into a distroless container and poke around. You cant install tools. You basically have to maintain a whole separate debug image just to troubleshoot.\n\nHow are you all actually solving this without it becoming a full-time job? Whats the workflow for keeping familiar build tools (apt, apk, curl, whatever) while still shipping lean secure runtime images? Is there tooling that helps manage this mess or is everyone just accepting the pain?\n\nRunning on AWS ECS.

The feeling that you need to gain access to debug to a running application, is just a legacy mindset. I see it every time a new developer joins that doesn't have much cloud native experience.\n\nEDIT Down vote if you like, doesn't change that a proper APM tool will make such practice obsolete, also it's lived experience ,  not a theory.\n\nEDIT what would you do inside the container if you had access? I'm curious, the only time I know it could be helpful is when you have a memory leak only in the real environment. And even then a real APM has built in profiling and should be able to see the cause.",

In a constantly evolving dynamic environment, it is hard to maintain.\n\nBuilding your application layer robust and making it less reactive for platform failures is the most practical approach. The problem of CVE is fixing it but letting the container to reboot with upgraded image. The development team will insist on your to keep a scheduled maintenance window. But you'll worry about running the container with a known vulnerability until the next scheduled maintenance window. So, if you insist on you dev team to build robust application that will not be affected with a reboot, you don't need to have planned maintenance. You can have a simple automatic script which will keep fixing all the CVEs as and when they appear.",

Minimus is not a magic fix but it can automatically highlight which files packages or dependencies your runtime actually needs versus what you are shipping blindly. Combine that with multi stage builds and automated scanning and you can actually get distroless like security without constantly rewriting Dockerfiles or maintaining a full separate debug image. It basically lets you focus on what matters debugging apps not the image layers.",

I would say that, for the orgs I work with, both the answers here are the best answers:\n\n1. Ensure that you have usable telemetry that reduces your need to interactively troubleshoot.  \n\n2. Build out a pattern using \\`kubectl debug\\` and an image built with all the tools you might need to debug so that you're ready when a team can't figure it out from their telemetry.\n\nSaying that you should have such amazing telemetry that you never have to interactively debug is a great philosophical position; however, my sense is that most orgs will never justify the levels of overhead and storage that might be necessary to do that SO OVERWHELMINGLY that they'll never need to break glass and debug interactively.  Better to have the pattern available, not need it, and eventually deprecate it than to need it and not have it.\n\nThere's also, always:\n\n3. Just ram \\`bash\\` and other basic tools in your distroless image.\n\nI \\_don't\\_ advocate this but, sometimes, the politics of the situation are that getting teams to give up the ability to \\`kubectl exec\\` in is, sometimes, too big a reach to start with.  There's not much shame in agreeing to trade off some risk for much larger wins.",
