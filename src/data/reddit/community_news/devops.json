Our scale is not that big, but the usage patterns (very fast ramp-up in traffic spikes and a nation-wide streaming service) are similar and we have encountered the same problems.  \n  \nWe minimized the use of NAT-gateways by leveraging transit gateways and avoided the ip-exhaustion by using IPv6. DNS performance has been a problem for us, but we finally fixed it for good by implementing node-local DNS-cache, getting rid of all alpine-images and setting ndots to 3.  \n  \nThe scaling up is still difficult to do fast enough, but by minimizing the size of container images, using fast pull-through caches for them, overprovisioning clusters so there's always free capacity and scaling replicas based on request count instead of CPU, we have managed to make it just fast enough to work 90% of time. We still need to manually scale up the minimum replicas before large events, though.",

Those chunks were published via CDNs to limit our own bandwidth needs. The “list of chunks” was kept current through the CDN with a short TTL.\n\nThe only thing a user had to be connected to us directly for was the DRM. But a single request to that system was good enough for 30 minute chunks, so scaling it was super easy.\n\nWhile there is inherently some delay in this architecture, it was only 30-60s (when I worked there 10 years ago; Maybe less now).",

I know this is bad, and I plan to raise it with leadership.\n\nMy immediate challenge isn’t fixing the org structure overnight, but the fact that we don’t have any process to track:\n\n* who owns a resource\n* why it exists\n* how long it should live (especially non-prod)\n\nThis leads to wasted spend, confusion during incidents, and risky cleanup decisions. SCPs aren’t an option since this is the management account, and pushing everything into member accounts right now feels unrealistic.\n\nFor folks who’ve inherited setups like this:\n\n* What practical process did you put in place first?\n* How did you enforce ownership and expiry without SCPs?\n* What minimum requirements should DevOps insist on?\n* Did you stabilise first, or push early for account separation?\n\nLooking for battle-tested advice, not ideal-world answers 🙂\n\n\n\nEdit: Thank you so much everyone who took time and shared their thoughts. I appreciate each and everyone of them! I have a plan ready to be presented with the management. Let's see how it goes, I'll let you all know how it went, wish me luck :)",

I’m at the tail end of one of these (created the new root org 3.5 years ago) and so far have discovered that \n\n* I won’t be able to migrate rds from the legacy account to the new app-production account while migrating to aurora. \n* Migrating dynamo is also possible but annoying— you have to create IAM permission grants and the application has to assume a role in the old or new account depending on whether the application is migrated before or after dynamo (or if dynamo is ending up in a different account than the application), and it’s likely that these applications have never had to assume a role before and are running some ancient version of boto and no one will ever have time to prioritize fixing it. \n* Migrating secretsmanager objects is very touchy and not trivial to script\n* MWAA does not actually want to work in the recommended best practice account structure (with the VPC shared over RAM from the infrastructure account to the app account) and needs an elaborate event bridge/lambda infrastructure to create vpc endpoints in the infra account\n\nI’m sure that if we were using other services we would have made other discoveries, and I’m sure that if we were using worse IAC (we did 95% of this with crossplane, and only used terraform for the VPC core resources and EKS clusters) like, for example, if we had kept 1 line of the awful horrendous CDK stuff that one of my predecessors tried to deploy, we would have learned other things.\n\nThis is an expensive migration. At the end of it, you will still just have the same capability as before. It will be drastically easier to explain things to auditors, it will be easier to grow in a sane way, your AWS spend will probably be higher at the end but with less waste, it will be safer and better in a dozen other ways that are difficult to quantify, but if your org is not otherwise growing/maturing it will be extremely difficult to explain to management why anyone should be working on this instead of deploying new features. And frankly, unless your org needs to transform for other reasons (growing rapidly, suddenly has more audit compliance needs), it is probably correct that feature development should take priority.",

Tagging will also help you track cloud spend. \n\nBased on that I would say start separating accounts. \n\nDisclaimer, again, I haven’t been in this exact situation, some more experienced folks may have different approaches, but this seems like a practical common-sense approach. ",

If you can separate each environment and their resources by tag, you can then come up with a plan to actually move these into their own accounts.\n\nGiven that everything is running at the company, it'll probably be easier to restrict the permissions when the resources are migrated to the new accounts. You would need to have clarified what permissions each group actually need for these new environments and their accounts. \n\nIn terms of what DevOps should insist on, it really depends on how you maintain all this. Who owns which part of the resources? Is the infrastructure with the software running inside or are they considered separate?\n\nOnce you have different environments tagged at the master account, you can start to import them into IaC. Depending on your design for how to maintain these, it could help to start separating them into different projects per environment at least. Will it be devops doing the whole IaC or are other developers or teams expected to maintain these as well? \n\nIf you want to migrate this into a proper setup, you need management buyin, then you need a way to allow people to make the switch in the \"least\" painful way in order to not have as much push back.",

And use something like CSPM to get independent security scores (hey, boss, we scores 20% on AWS' security best practices, is that ok?).\n\nGood luck! it's been a long road here, and every 2 steps forward are challenged, but we are now mindful of value & security, along with lifecycle. Even if we still have a ton of tech debt, we're making things better faster than were making them worse.",

One in particular resonated with me, it was around providing code validation evidence directly in the PR (partly because the company I work for builds a tool which does just that - mirrord) in other words, \"Show me hard evidence that you validated your finding or feature submission and show me how to reproduce it.\"\n\nNot a silver bullet, but actual code validation is something AI can't fake or do without actually understanding the context and environment the application runs in.",

Your observability tooling (e.g. otel, prometheus, grafana, new relic, whatever) tracks these headers to build out the distributed tracing graphs.",

It allows quickly identifying bottlenecks and issues in requests served with microservice architecture. But the tracing doesn't work in practice on highly loaded systems most of the time, because it generates a ton of data (trace spans), which requires a lot of costs for processing, storing and querying. These costs are usually higher than the costs for the monitored microservices. There are workarounds with various types of sampling for the collected traces (i.e. only a small part of traces are stored and are available for querying and analysts). But the sampling can drop traces for requests you may need to investigate in the future.",

Similar architecture design and implementation issues, mostly because of really bad documentation. Getting your logs archived is a whole month-long project because they have shoehorned you to put everything into a log workspace and use the exporting rules, and those blobs do not even support archiving. Duplicating at the source gets you different formats as now you have three implementations (log export rule, data collection rule and platform logs). It's a fucking mess.\n\nPaid monitoring platforms like Datadog etc. keep shining, but have scummy business practices and know what they have, so you are paying a $$$$$ premium for something that platform-native monitoring solutions could do almost for free while not trying to get fucked over by them which they actively try to do to squeeze money out of you.\n\nPagerDuty I have worked with recently and it's just a complete freaking mess. Undocumented everything, magic everywhere, nothing useful on the important part like getting stuff into the platform in a robust and sane way etc. Even then alert management leave a lot to be desired.\n\n---\n\nAll in all, I believe the only viable, scalable and especially operatable implementation is the classic OSS Grafana+Prometheus+Loki stack with some development and design time under it.",

The problem is when something breaks, you’re staring at data without knowing which change actually mattered. That’s where things get messy. The teams handling this better are closing the gap between code changes and runtime signals. They track not just what failed, but what behavior was introduced. That context comes from understanding PR-level intent, dependencies, and flow changes, not from dashboards. We’ve seen this internally while building CodeAnt AI: when reviewers understand impact upfront (what paths change, which services are touched, what assumptions shift), production observability becomes confirmation, not discovery.\n\nSo in 2026, observability isn’t cleaner tools, it’s fewer unknowns. Less guessing which deploy caused it. Less spelunking. More continuity between code, review, and runtime.",

Now they have changed this strategy, but they moved to a slightly more fair pay for what you use strategy again mostly. Paying for ingest makes sense, however our new issues are with queries. We are now charged for these, a single dashboard for query to try and identify a root cause can go through such a large quantity of data and add up extremely quick. We have tried, but we were given zero ways to optimize these queries as we only ran into their platform limitations and they really just want us to pay. Again as an observability company, they seem to have zero interest in obseravability.  \n\\- Their UI brings even modern PCs to their kness, dashboards being the worst. We also struggled to get it to asign users tot he correct accounts if a user had multiple orgs assigned. So they constantly logged in and saw the wrong data, which was easy to change once they realised, but frustrating  \n\\- Their account managers for our region have all left and we were given an overseas team who simply did not care about our business, only signing the next years contract.\n\nThis is a competitive space, NR seems like they have a lot to offer, but they stopped major innovation a while back, many competitors are hungry for that market share now.",

It doesn’t matter if it goes down for a while. Now I have a brand new application running in K8s (GKE) at GCP that needs to talk to databases at both Azure and GCP. It can talk to the GCP database with no problem but cannot talk to assure. I made sure all the route tables look good, firewall rules and so on. Nothing I did would make it talk to the Azure DB. Days of troubleshooting later, I find out that traffic from a GKE pod is not routable over a single VPN connection between cloud providers. I will have to rebuild the VPN as an HA VPN with BGP and then it will be routable. I have no idea why a K8s pod isn’t routable over it. A VM running the app routes over it perfectly fine. It’s just GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) that has the limitation. I now have it working in QA.  \nThis was the most bullshitty networking troubleshooting I’ve ever had to do.

This idea runs into the whole reason for DevOps movement where there has to be ownership at the boundary between knowledge domains.

That gets the Kubernetes cluster up. For the first time install of Argo CD we use a Helm chart, sometimes Terraform's Helm provider but often it is a manual apply because it only happens once at cluster bootstrapping. After that Argo CD manages everything else including itself via its own manifests in a GitOps repo. If we need to upgrade Argo CD or roll out a new version we update the Git repo and let Argo CD reconcile itself. Ansible did not really fit into the pipeline once we committed to everything living in the cluster. It is more for legacy VM config or when we need to do something directly on a node for weird edge cases. As for plugin installs we do the same thing, define it in Git and let Argo CD roll it out alongside everything else. In production I have seen that once Argo CD is there you do not want to mix too many config tools anymore. Makes life easier to keep that boundary clean.",

If not, ArgoCD is just going to add noise.  The nice thing about terraform is the ease in which you can destroy resources. I can use Ansible to provision my cloud resources pretty easily. But then have to write almost as many plays in reverse order to destroy those resources.  But if your team is good at Ansible, then it’s really a non-issue.  I can write a local provisioner in terraform but if my team doesn’t know HCL what’s the value? \n\nWe’ve had different professional services teams try and sell their best idea of provisioning and it all falls on deaf ears if it’s just one more thing the team needs to learn.  At the end of the day, provisioning clusters probably isn’t making the company any money.

I’ve been in the cloud space for about a year now, and overall I have around 5–6 years of IT experience.\n\nIn the cert side, i have AZ-900, AZ-104, AZ-305, and AZ-400\n\nIn my current role I worked my way up to a medior level, but my real goal is to move into DevOps. I know that means I need solid Docker and Kubernetes knowledge, so I’ve started learning and practicing them in my limited free time. I’ve even built some small projects already.\n\nThe problem is that my current salary is around standard market level, which is great, but when I apply for DevOps roles, I usually run into two outcomes:\n\n1, I don’t even get invited to an interview,\n\n2, I get an interview, but they offer me about half my current salary because they would hire me as a junior DevOps engineer due to my lack of hands-on experience with Docker and Kubernetes.\n\nRight now I simply can’t afford to cut my salary in half. On top of that, my current company doesn’t really use Docker or Kubernetes, so I don’t have the chance to gain real work experience with them.\n\nI know the market is shit for switching jobs right now, but living in a country where salaries are already much lower than in most of Europe makes this even more frustrating. Honestly, it’s hard to see a clear way forward.\n\nWhat would you do in my situation? How would you successfully pivot into DevOps without taking such a big financial step back?

Learn how to bake security into software development rather than tacking it on later.\n\nYeah, that learning that stuff is going to be hard without some exposure to developers, software development and being able to speak their language. Good luck.",

The team lead of our DevOps department wanted me over there because of my IaC and Kubernetes experience, but my manager blocked the move so I decided to look out and see what are my options.\n\nNext month I'm starting in another company as a Cloud Engineer again but with a 50% pay rise to what I'm currently getting. So my suggestion would be to not fixate so hard on the title, but the pay of it.\n\nYou already have strong experience and nice certifications. Get CKA and CKS maybe and you'll learn what you need about Kubernetes. Knock out Terraform Associate, it's pretty easy cert and with your experience you should get it in no time. \n\n  \nWhat I'm saying is look what's out there, As others have said you are already doing 80% of what a DevOps is and that's just a title with different responsibilites and meaning in each company.

      "text": "Hey everyone — I few days ago I was told my role is being made redundant, and around 50% of the company is being laid off due to budget cuts. I had a feeling it might be coming, but I didn’t realise things were this bad.\n\nSince 2020 I have just been husting to finish uni, working part time, paying off my debts, and then rushing to crack an interview for my first big boy job and then after 4 years of working I get laid off. I know people have had it much worse but I still feel like crap.\n\nSince getting the news, I’ve been pretty overwhelmed. This was my first proper job after Uni.\n\nI went into full apply and started applying like crazy — tailoring resumes, writing cover letters, the whole lot. I’ve put in 30+ applications in the last 3–4 days. Some roles are a perfect match, others are more like 80% or 60%, and I’m trying to be realistic and apply to adjacent roles too.\n\nBut now I’m hitting a wall — I’m exhausted, and then I feel guilty when I’m not applying. On top of that, seeing 100+ applicants on LinkedIn makes it feel like I’m shouting into the void.\n\nFor those of you who’ve been through layoffs/redundancy before:\n\nIs this “high volume + tailored” approach actually the right move?\n\nHow did you pace yourself without burning out?\n\nAny tips for targeting a niche field (even through you have 60-70% of other skills for other roles) when there just aren’t many openings? \n\nMy work domain is: Kubernetes/HPC/Linux/IaC/Automation...etc etc\n\nWould really appreciate any advice or even just hearing how others are coping. And how long do you set the boundary or the time box? As in how long should I put into the search for the right job (nische field) compared to grabbing whatever I get next. And since im in IT/Tech applications dont get assessed until the applications are closed and then it takes 1-3 weeks for the recruiters to actually get to it.\n\nI wish I had a knob I could turn and fast forward time by a few months.\n\nSorry for the rant and TIA.",

Don’t let your ‘mood’ change your behaviour. \n\nSo, firstly, forget about being able to see how many other people have applied for jobs on LinkedIn or wherever else. Most of those will be speculative and/or poor quality.\n\nDon’t be intimidated by job ads. Try to see past the tone and requirements, and really understand what the hiring company wants and needs. And how that fits with what you can offer.\n\nIf you have the core of what they need, then apply and foreground that experience. Hiring companies will ‘make do’ with people who lack some of what a job ad is asking for, if that person can show/indicate high proficiency in the things that matter. In fact, they may turn down people who can check all the boxes, in favour of someone who is showing higher proficiency in critical areas.\n\nGood luck.

It serves as a searchable directory for high-quality opensource, but what I'm really proud of is the \"community curation\" type features (upvotes and discussions) to help surface the best projects. After a lot of hours I've managed to create a directory of 1028 opensource software.\n\nI've seen multiple other sites which have the same premise and all the GitHub Awesome Lists, but they lack in identifying if the repo is active, abandoned or just the general consensus of the OSS they have listed, the upvote system on this directory should really help show which OSS excel. I'm also working a deeper categorization system which shows alerts and highlights about the repos status , eg. whether the project is experimental, buggy/unstable, has a restrictive license or corporate influence.\n\nI've added a submission system so you opensource developers out there can list your projects.",

It's exciting to see more companies evaluating modern infrastructure options and thinking critically about what works best for their teams.\n\nI agree that the \"right\" answer really depends on your team's background and what stage you're at. The Terraform vs Pulumi debate often comes down to whether you prefer HCL's declarative constraints or the flexibility of real programming languages. Both have their place\n\nYour point about PaaS solutions for early-stage teams makes total sense. We're seeing this a lot at Render too, teams that want to ship features fast without becoming infrastructure experts first. You get managed databases, auto-scaling, and built-in security without writing any IaC at all. Then as you grow and your needs get more specific, you can always add infrastructure-as-code on top or migrate to something more complex.\n\nThe Kubernetes-native tools you mentioned (Crossplane, ACK, etc.) are interesting for teams already committed to K8s, but that's a pretty heavy lift if you're just trying to get an app in front of users\n\nWhat infrastructure approach are you all currently using, and what's been the biggest pain point?",

Neither option is that wrong, though Pulumi might run out of funding faster than OpenTofu perhaps in a decade from now. That's too long to consider though. For what it's worth, both can reap the benefits of Claude Code just fine, so my advice is OpenTofu if you want to scale and definitely use AI (so long as you know what you're doing on paper and not just blindly letting Claude Code make services).\n\nI'm just now learning TF/OpenTofu but I started with Pulumi for a project because I heard loops were a nightmare in TF. I had a good understanding of AWS/GCP (where I used both and also needed to deploy to Oracle), and Claude Code helped me code the majority of the infra in Pulumi. I wouldn't say there were any bugs with Pulumi rather lots of niche, unknown AWS things that I couldn't figure out.\n\nI will say: Claude Code can be your friend for either option but only if you know all the basics of the AWS services and can choose which services to use by yourself without AI. Otherwise, it might hallucinate a little.\n\nI do think Pulumi offers something that made it appealing for a consulting shop making on-prem deployments on behalf of customers which was the Pulumi Automation API.\n\nI'm now learning TF and seeing if Claude Code works for it for a startup that doesn't need to deploy en masse and customized per customer, just normal service deployments. I think 95% of startups don't have a need that makes Pulumi worth it over TF.\n\nIf long-term alive-ness is the concern, and you don't have a need for the Automation API, then I would just use TF/OpenTofu because DevOps folks for hire generally only want to deal with TF since they're used to it. Obviously, your code base will be a mess since you're new, but folks you eventually hire tend to always fix things in subjective ways.\n\nWith all those Pulumi employees out on Reddit, I would assume one reads this, but having Pulumi infer what the problem is using an AI would be helpful. AWS doesn't give proper error messages, so you have to ask around and infer based on past issues why AWS is not working. But for what it's worth, Pulumi itself was never a problem.\n\nI will say the Pulumi slack is decently helpful. The community helped me figure out all those AWS issues and some Pulumi beginner issues. Just takes a few hours fwiw.",

Unfortunately my org was very heavy into logs as metrics/everything **only** (shoot me kthx) and were really stubborn about it.

Everything was abstracted away from them, with full flexibility to customize as much as they needed by adding to their simple yaml. (Keda, logging, ingress, storage, auth federation etc). \n\nOther examples would be custom CRDs written in go to simplify Vault auth && secret injections, setting up federated access to cloud resources (workload identity etc)\n\nIn retrospect, my resume does not go into any details about any of that, which I really should be adding. \n\nWould it make sense to consolidate the entire compliance aspect into one larger bullet and refine what i mentioned above into another point or two?\n\n\nAlso, what would you consider platform/dev-ex \n\nThe way I see it, its abstracting away pain points for devs so that they can focus on app dev, and not really give a shit about the underlying infra/things to get their app deployed to prod beyond things they really care about beyond a few lines of yaml. \n\nWe did not have an IDP, everything was mono-repo abstractions, setting up a new service was running a script that basically had a bunch of questions that would ultimately spit out a folder with most of the setup done",

The field is also getting more and more competitive at the high end, as there’s less emphasis on places to higher junior engineers anymore. If you really practice on what you wanna say in interviews and speak succinctly and confidently, at the staff level that will sell people. They want people who are self-motivated and can handle difficult projects without having to babysit. You also have to be great at working with other teams and working in areas you or no one else at the company may know and quickly become an expert at it. At this level it’s also how well you can market an idea and get other teams on board.",

The more tailored the resume is to that specific job the better. \n\nI disagree with those who say you do not have platform experience, as that name really encompasses so many things now. The bar for staff has also become lower (that or everyone is just sr/staff level now). It depends on the job description. If it matches what you’re good at, then the actual job title doesn’t mean anything.

A CS degree probably gave you solid fundamentals architecture, networking, OS concepts, etc. Also, plenty of DevOps engineers don’t work in the cloud at all.\n\nYou already have Linux and Bash, which is a strong base. Cloud is mostly just another abstraction layer: permissions become IAM, VMs become Compute Engine/EC2, and so on.\n\nBefore you jump into certifications, I’d honestly build a small homelab. Install Proxmox, then set up a few things, for example:\n\n\t•\ta NAS VM for storage\n\n\t•\tVMs for a Docker host, LDAP, Pi-hole\n\n\t•\ton the Docker host: Jellyfin/Plex, whatever you actually use\n\nOnce you’ve done it manually, you’ll naturally want to automate it. Start with templates, then move to Ansible + Git. Later you can replace more and more with Terraform (or at least use IaC principles), and you’ll learn the concepts way deeper.\n\nWhy? Because you’ll hit the same problems as in the cloud, just on a smaller scale:\n\n\t•\thow to manage access across machines\n\t•\thow to provision machines faster\n\t•\thow to optimize resources\n\t•\thow to standardize setups\n\nAnd yeah, you’ll probably end up writing some custom Python scripts once you start seeing opportunities.\n\nAI will replace “clickers.” I’ve met people who’ve been in cloud roles for years and still can’t do the basics underneath. And some companies will test that (e.g., “set up LDAP” or similar tasks), even if the job is cloud-heavy.\n\nInternal transfer is honestly one of the best paths so go for it like you said. Once your fundamentals and concepts are solid, then start learning Azure.",

Manual testers often have a solid grounding in quality thinking, which aligns really well with DevOps because you’re already focused on finding issues early and improving reliability that’s a mindset, not just a job title.\n\nA few practical ways people make this transition smoothly:\n\n1) Leverage what you already know  \nYour Python, Linux, and shell scripting skills are real assets, they’re exactly the kind of automation foundation DevOps looks for. Many testers begin by automating test suites in CI/CD pipelines and that naturally evolves into owning delivery pipelines.\n\n2) Start with automation + CI/CD projects  \nSet up a small project (even on your own) that:\n\n* Builds via GitHub Actions/CI on every commit\n* Runs automated tests\n* Deploys to a staging environment That gives you practical pipeline experience interviewers love to see.\n\n3) Learn cloud and IaC incrementally  \nYou don’t need to know everything at once, focus on one cloud (AWS, Azure, or GCP depending on your company) and get comfortable with basic services + how to automate their provisioning (Terraform or managed stacks).\n\n4) Use your testing background as leverage  \nInstead of starting from scratch, frame your QA experience as quality assurance in delivery , DevOps values people who understand how to prevent regressions and improve pipeline confidence.\n\nOne pattern I see in successful transitions is turning every manual step you currently do into an automated, observable step ,that’s literally what modern DevOps delivery systems are built on. Once you have even a couple of proofs of work (GitHub repo, pipeline examples), internal transfers and interviews become much more straightforward.",

Users getting 5xx errors is always a problem.\n\nWe break it into three tiers. Page someone when users are affected right now. Slack notification when something needs attention today like a cert expiring in 14 days. Just log it when it's interesting but not urgent.\n\nThe other thing that took us years to learn is that if an alert fires and we consistently do nothing about it, we delete the alert. Alert fatigue is real and it makes you ignore the alerts that actually matter.\n\nWrote up the full 10-layer framework we use covering everything from infrastructure to log patterns.
