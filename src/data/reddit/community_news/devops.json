For example are they being hardcoded, are devlogs getting pushed with the code, is your .env or .secrets files getting pushed.\n\nBut you are right that a pre-commit hook and a IDE plugin are the way to go. I would go Pre-commit hook but this is blocking and seems like you need noise on this. \n\nIf false positives are a big issue then you might want to only block commits on secrets that are valid. Most secrets detection platforms and top tier OS tools like TruffleHog have this option. \n\nOne thing you said does raise some questions for me ***miss obvious patterns.***  \nWhen people test secrets detection tool often they often include fake secrets to test them. But most of the time if the tool is good it can filter out obvious false positives. So sometimes what makes a tool look bad is actually what makes them good. For example if you have a fake AWS key that matches the pattern a tool might do a API call to test it and if its invalid ignore the finding. So you may want to reevaluate some.   \nThis post explains a bit more on that [https://www.aikido.dev/blog/secrets-detection-what-to-look-for-when-choosing-a-tool](https://www.aikido.dev/blog/secrets-detection-what-to-look-for-when-choosing-a-tool)",

Really the only difference to a traditional platform engineering is that you have a lot more ETL around training and retraining, and your CI/CD platforms have to be able to handle gpu and multi gpu optimizations and deployment. I work on systems that abstract cuda and hardware choices away from developers (I want the best hardware to be picked for them when they train their models so they don’t have to worry about things like chipset architecture on supporting loss of precision of floating points for example). \n\nSo you have to have moderate coding/compliers/gpu knowledge. Enough that you could train a model yourself if you wanted to. Simply so you can build the systems that support them. \n\nIt’s still just massive k8 and build tooling work and now slap on metrics cycle on gpu tasks more than cpu, and how many people may use your model outputs (in the case of classic ML) or your model itself (LLM//diffusion) which is more like large scale api design.",

A bad analogy but the LeBron of coding can train someone daily and even if that someone is receptive to taking that advice or training, when they never utilize it. It feels like a lost cause. \n\nSmartest person in the room is subjective for me how big is the room and who’s in it. If it’s a small DevOps team then I really wouldn’t mind and would kind of expect it to happen at some point. A lot of ops/sre work ends up collaborating with backend/front end engineers or data engineers and I’m always learning on that front. \n\nFortunately have never worked somewhere or on a team where no one’s idea or thought was not recognized or considered.",

DevOps is about making the Devs aware of the products lifecycle, which include the deployment but not only.\n\nMaking them aware does not mean you don't need Ops anymore. That's an incorrect, yet understandable, confusion. Again, the Operational counterpart of Development does not exist, that's the infrastructure. \n\nUnless you use the cloud, you will have on-prem infrastructure and maintaining the infrastructure is the role the Ops. For example: upgrading the nodes of your VMWare cluster, replacing the hardware, creating MLAG to ensure redundant networks, ... that's the role of the Ops.\n\nIt's not replacing, it's making them work hand-in-hand.\n\n### DevOps and Project Management\n\nDevOps \"infinite loop\" finds its root in ITIL which also brought Agile and SCRUM. This cycle is iterative, like the sprints, opposed to the \"waterfall development\". Yet, nobody claims it's replacing project management.\n\n\n### DevOps job is an absurdity\n \nAt least that's my opinion. The DevOps job usually mean \"someone that uses devops tools\". So you can have DevOps hired in an infrastructure team. But DevOps isn't about the tools.\n\nYou can respect the mentality with handmade perl scripts and documentation if you want.\n\nIf I use a knife, I don't become a chief. Similarly, if a network engineer use ansible and a scheduled pipeline, they don't become a DevOps.\n\nA \"DevOps\" is just a developer who is aware of the product lifecycle. It makes no sense to name a job by your mentality and approach of the problem.\n\nWe don't give title like \"agressive saleperson\" or \"encourage collaboration manager\". Why make the work strategie of a developer their title then?\n\nNote: I have been at this position for years in the past in decently big companies.

The billing tool says one thing, the reality is another...\n\nRealistically, if you want good results, you need to provide financial incentives to the fin-ops person lol. You can easily compete for the best talent. Offer them a one time 50bps bonus or something of what they save based on spend at some date. Then offer some kind of structure that is goal/metrics driven about performance. Most of the time changing things is very annoying and so the natural incentive is to let things be as they are.",

My team has a KPI this year to reduce cloud spend by seven figures, largely on my assertions we could make it happen and by we I mean me.  Most of that will come from backporting architectural refinements onto application stacks that I don't own, but that the owners/teams aren't really capable of doing themselves due to resource and/or skill limitations.\n\nI find wasteful resource spending due to inefficiencies or just sloppy work to be professionally embarrassing and offensive.  It's not my money, it's technically not even my job responsibility, but \"FinOps\" is something of my own personal crusade and as luck would have it I've found upper management *really* appreciates when an email report they didn't even ask for comes in with some big dollar savings numbers.  Nothing says, \"put this guy at the top of the bonus list\", more than saving more than your own salary as a side hustle.  You know what doesn't impress the brass nearly as much?  Shaving 20ms off page response times, adding 0.01% to your uptime SLIs, or deploying 10% faster.\n\nWhat were we talking about again?",

Like I just can’t progress. And not because there is no option. There is a tom of stuff to learn there. I just feel like I am stuck in the learning phase of the new job. The onboarding.\n\nI, unfortunately, didn’t have much chance to work with K8S, Helm, and ArgoCD in my previous roles, and they are heavily used at this place. And now after a month tasks that feel like an easy solve code-wise become shitty debugging because a lot of stuff are built weird (my team’s words, not mine).\n\nThe manager lives abroad so I can’t ask him for help, and the other team members are busy with their work, and I feel like a burden at this point. Like I am harassing them with my questions about stuff that “I should already know”.\n\nHow do I get over this? How do I get the excitement I had when I worked at the previous companies?\n\nAlso, what good ways are there to learn ArgoCD and K8S in a company with an already built infrastructure but almost no organized documentation?\n\nThanks guys",

You can talk to him and agree on some periodic sync-ups and some plan/scope to work on between them, so that you have enough time to figure out things on your own, and he receives your questions in portions. It will be easier to both of you, and will essentially render him your manager, even though not officially. Which seems to be fine in your situation for now.

Mastery of these technologies leads to more rewarding roles, bigger impact, and faster career progression. \n\nWhile these tools are the current standard, keep an eye on the horizon. As AI and automation evolve to handle more \"traditional\" DevOps tasks, there is a growing need to understand Data and ML Pipelines (platforms like Spark, Kafka, and Airflow). \n\n**My Path to Becoming Advanced:**\n\n* **Infrastructure as Code:** I started by deploying Kubernetes clusters on AWS (EKS), GCP (GKE), and Azure (AKS) using both CLI tools (like `eksctl`) and Terraform.\n* **Beyond the Cluster:** The most important part isn't implementing K8s; it’s what you run *on* it. I gained a lot of ground working with a distributed graph database (Dgraph), which forced me to integrate service meshes, monitoring, and Ingress/Gateways. I’ve experimented with Linkerd, Istio, and Cilium to handle this.\n* **Next Frontiers:** I’m currently looking into GitOps tools (ArgoCD, FluxCD), secrets management (Vault), and policy engines.\n\n**The \"Programmatic\" Shift:**  \nOne major skill gap I see is moving beyond `kubectl` and `helm`. I highly recommend learning to do the same tasks programmatically using **Go** and/or **Python**. \n\n**Entry into Data/AI:**  \nIn a recent contract, I deployed DataHub (data governance), which relies on Elasticsearch, Kafka, and PostgreSQL. Deploying Kafka in a locked-down secure environment was a massive challenge, but it got my foot in the door with Data/AI infrastructure. \n\n**Certifications:**  \nI’m currently focusing on HashiCorp certs (Vault, Consul, Terraform), though I’m still working on the discipline to round out my K8s certifications, and follow up cloud certifications.  These are not strictly necessary, but it gives me some structure for studies. \n\nMy best advice: don't just learn the tool; learn how the data flows through it.",

Comparative analysis builds more depth of knowledge in the shortest amount of time, especially when green-fielding a project. \n\nThe 'Battle-Tested' Portfolio Framework:\n\n* **Managed K8s Face-off:** Deploy the same application on **AKS vs. GKE vs. EKS**. Document the differences in networking, IAM integration, and operational overhead.\n* **The Mesh Choice:** Integrate and compare service meshes like **Linkerd, Istio, or Cilium**. Don't just install them; document how each handles your specific reverse proxy ingress or API Gateway.\n* **CI Automation Duel:** Build the same pipeline in **GitHub Actions vs. GitLab CI**.\n* **GitOps Strategy:** Compare **ArgoCD vs. FluxCD** for continuous delivery, specifically looking at multi-cluster synchronization.\n* **Observability Stack:** Set up log aggregation using **Loki vs. Fluent Bit** (or the ELK stack) and show which one provides better signal-to-noise for your specific application. \n\n**The Key for 2026:** Hiring managers in 2026 are looking for engineers who can explain *why* they chose one tool over another. Use a public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/) to host your code, include clear architecture diagrams, and write a 'Lessons Learned' section for each comparison. That is what gets you past the AI filters and into the senior-level technical interviews.",

When I'm hiring DevOps people it's not just for PHP, Java or whatever.  It's for a very wide knowledge of things.

We do Bash and Python, but you're stuck at an old place doing Perl.  We can make that work.  You don't do Kubernetes, neither do we so we're behind the times too because we use EC2 and ECS.\n\nWe also support la bunch of different SaaS stuff for our devs.  New Relic, but you only know DataDog, we can make it work...  \n\nBe a learner, not someone trying to present the perfect resume.

I will likely need to work a much lower position in IT support (I'm completely out of money and lost my apartment already; Unemployment is not giving enough for cost of living here) and study evenings because I cannot pass an interview given the last several I've had going poorly; I simply do not have the necessary knowledge.

          "text": "Mimir is always going to be an efficiency drop. Prometheus queries use in-memory cache with minimal overhead.\n\nWith Mimir you are now using networking and object storage for every query. Prometheus scrapes, sends that data to a Mimir receiver, which then has to act like another Prometheus and create TSDB blocks, then store in object storage. Then you have to pull it back down from object storage to query it.\n\nThis is the downside to being able to distribute queries over multiple servers. Read up on [latency numbers every engineer should know](https://gist.github.com/jboner/2841832).\n\nMimir and Prometheus basically use the exact same storage format. It's just that Mimir stores this in object storage instead of local disk.\n\nOn cloud providers, object storage tends to be cheaper per byte than local volumes, which is why long-term storage in Mimir or Thanos are sometimes cheaper. But then you have to factor in per-request object storage use costs.\n\nThis is why I typically recommend Thanos over Mimir. You continue to use Prometheus for efficient scrape, storage, and query. With the [Thanos Distributed Engine](https://thanos.io/v0.40/components/query.md/#thanos-promql-engine-experimental) you get query pushdown advantages. There's also work to [test Parquet](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos-parquet-gateway) as a more efficient object storage format.\n\nMimir was created with main goal to create a SaaS service so you can send your data to a 3rd party.",

For ex: CI/CD isn't 'deploy fast', it's 'reduce MTTR by 50% to unblock sales team during outages'.

Every one of them added a huge amount of JavaScript and dragged our Lighthouse score down. All we actually needed was a simple way for visitors to send a message and for us to reply quickly.\n\nSo I built a small custom chat widget myself. It is about 5KB, written in plain JavaScript, and runs on Cloudflare Workers using WebSockets. For the backend I used Discord, since our team already lives there. Each conversation becomes a thread and replies show up instantly for the visitor.\n\nOnce we switched, our performance score went back to 100 and the widget loads instantly. No third party scripts, no tracking, no SaaS dashboard, and no recurring fees. Support replies are actually faster because they come straight from Discord.\n\nI wrote a detailed breakdown of how it works and how I built it here if anyone is curious\n\nhttps://tasrieit.com/blog/building-custom-chat-widget-discord-cloudflare-workers\n\nGenuinely curious if others here have built their own replacements for common SaaS tools or if most people still prefer off the shelf solutions.",

That's about the closest case where I didn't use anything other than plain English to describe what I wanted to happen (connect to my Chrome browser where I have a saved profile logged into LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Indeed and search for specific jobs).\n\nThat's about the only \"no-code\" solution I can feasibly imagine where the LLM navigates the web page.  It's okay, but it's still subject to fabrication/hallucinations (e.g. it pointed me to 10 URLs to supposed job postings that didn't exist).  I'd peg it at about an 80% success rate, but I'd still need to verify the results.  That's generally why I would never trust AI to apply to jobs for me (because I would never trust it enough not to make up skills or experience I don't have).\n\n  \nOtherwise I'm not sure how browser automation can be \"no-code\".  LLMs are fine, but they're not deterministic.  For example, in one run of one workflow on one day, the results were 100% factually correct.  But then the exact same workflow executed against the same website on a different day with the same AI model had 100% fabricated results.  So LLMs can do more than scripts, but they're not as predictable or reliable.\n\nI'd probably just ask LLM to use Playwright to explore a site, do what I want, generate a script, then verify it manually.",

Lately, seeing how the market is going, I’ve been feeling a bit uneasy — especially with developer roles getting hundreds of applications within hours.\n\nGiven the current situation in IT (and particularly software development), I’m seriously considering pivoting toward Cloud / DevOps.\n\nI already have: •\tA solid systems administration foundation •\tHands-on experience with cloud. CI/CD etc\n\nWhat I’m unsure about: •\tIs moving to Cloud/DevOps a smart strategic move right now? •\tHow difficult is the transition from a senior backend role? •\tWhat skills should I double down on first (Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS/GCP certs, Linux internals, etc.)?\n\nWould love to hear from people who: •\tMade a similar transition •\tAre currently working in Cloud/DevOps\n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

I made the move inside the company because it was offered and I had just learned what docker was and it interested me. We then started to move from bare metal hosts to VMs which lasted about a year before moving to kubernetes. The company was then acquired and I was on a contract which tied my severance to a timeframe to migrate our clients, but because of my kubernetes and docker experience I was offered a permanent role with the sister company to the one that had contracted me. I'm now a principal SRE and the kubernetes SME supporting clusters for both of the companies. I may be a bit biased, but knowing kubernetes, being able to migrate monolith applications to docker, and managing both cloud and onprem infrastructures is what got me where I am. I have no idea how the job market is though since I haven't been actively looking",

Same thing with managing kubernetes clusters. Still struggle with VPN setups and classic on-prem work. But the rest of the stuff I learned on the job over time. Aws certificates helped deepen missing cloud knowledge. \n\nDefinitely focus on a cloud certificates and kubernetes home lab. Actual cloud experience matters more but if you don’t have this a certification helps. Cicd tools differ depending on employer, better to just understand the concept.
