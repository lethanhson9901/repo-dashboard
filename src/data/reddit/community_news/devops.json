I am not working anymore, I either use AI or when I start to use my brain, everyone around me answers with AI. I am not an angel, I am a junior that can’t learn properly because no one wants to, everyone wants AI and less human error.\n\nThe only thing it failed at was deep architecture like database migration and specific clustering, but everything else it simply just does it and when it doesn’t, we only have to do maybe a single thing to fix it. \n\nI am leaving the DevOps as a field and getting into security (was really interested in it before) but I genuinely feel like I was trolled and did nothing, and maybe even soon security would be replaced with AI.\n\nThis post may be stupid to seniors, but as a junior and people starting, this is reality. We don’t learn, we don’t grow, we are the ones getting replaced and I see no field being currently resistant to that. I will just get into moltbook and doom scroll.\n\nThank you for everyone who helped me pave my devops path, it is really one of the best fields I’ve ever went in and honored to have been here even if just for a short while, hopefully where I live is the problem and not the entire planet.",

IIIb approaches with no minimums, the pilot always needs to make the decision to land and to take over and fly the last 50+ feet of altitude. This is dependent on having a specific set of ground equipment, and dependent on having the airplane equipped with certain equipment like HUD technology. Not all airliners are equipped for no-minimum-RVR approaches. Takeoffs are dependent on the aircraft equipment, the airport, and the pilots. Some do it by hand some depend entirely on automation. \n\nWhat you’re talking about with captains and first officers is … not quite correct. There still being a difference between captains and first officers is an acknowledgement that in an emergency there can only be one person in charge. Back in the day, this would be a deference that was explicit - the captain was always in charge, and the first officer is an assistant. After a few horrendous air accidents caused by the person “in charge” being incorrect and also unable to be challenged, cockpit culture was changed by training something called “Crew Resource Management” which made it clear that everyone is required to speak up when something is wrong no matter the “rank” and that air crew should divide tasks and then work their assigned tasks. CRM is incredibly effective at preventing accidents and it’s notable where it breaks down like the runway excursion at Roanoke last year. It’s also one of the reasons that single pilot commercial flights are a bad idea. \n\nFirst officers are not “inexperienced” and in modern US airlines will have about 1500 hours in the cockpit with the engines on before they’re allowed to fly passengers, and will have dozens of hours of structured training in simulators and flying the actual airplane type under a check captain before they’re allowed to crew a regular flight. Using my sister as an example, she had 300 hours when she became a flight instructor, 1200 hours before working for a small regional airline, and over 2500 hours with the engines going round before she got a job at a main line. As a first officer, she now has over 3,000 hours in the type of aircraft she flies. Still a first officer. Keeping in mind that a pilot’s work day is typically double the flight time or more, that’s quite a lot of working time. \n\nThe things that create safety in airlines (multiple crew, defined roles, structured training) are the things that tech companies are saying it’s too expensive to do for our jobs.",

I remember seeing a comment once about how it’s not math until it has letters - and I’m sure a lot of people would insist at least half of them need to be Greek letters. 🤓\n\nBut more seriously as a math BS (so still very lightweight) I think the main characteristic of math is that it’s entirely about relationships. Relationships that can be rigorously proven with a small set of acceptable tools.\n\nArithmetic is important, and will always be important in many areas, but there’s a strong argument that people who would be naturally gifted in mathematics are driven away by the mindless drudgery of K-8 arithmetic. People should always be able to add 2 and 3 in their head but many of us think good estimation is more important once you get above 100 or so. E.g, seeing 27 x 414 should tell you the result will be around 30 x 400 or 12000 because you know how to round up or down appropriately. That may be good enough by itself, or at least you’ll know there’s a problem if the calculator gives you a wildly different number. In this case it’s 11,178, so the estimate is off by less than 7%. But if the result was 21,000 you know enough to double check the values you saw and the values typed into the calculator or spreadsheet.",

But cloud and k8s are layers of abstractions built upon the real networks and real hardware. And they bring more layers, take software defined networks, or virtual k8s clu sters, and so on.  \n\nAnd ultimately, when shit hits the fan and you have a real problem with networking in your virtual clusters, guess what -- they don't have the skills to debug it. Some folks are not even able to read through a man page nowadays.\n\nNow add AI on top of that, and you have a perfect recipe for disaster. \nOn the other hand, that's exactly why senior engineers with real skills just grin sarcastically when they hear that AI will take our jobs. \n\nAI is a great tool, but if you don't understand what you are doing it won't help you. People used to copy-paste complex bash one-liners without understanding them, now they produce whole codebases without a slightest hint of understanding how \"their\" code works.

The *old* kind. Servers, procedures, change requests, actual humans touching things. It wasn’t glamorous, but it worked. Then DevOps showed up with YAML, pipelines, and a moral superiority complex.\n\nSuddenly everything we did was “legacy.”  \nToo slow.  \nToo manual.  \nToo human.\n\nThey didn’t fire us right away. That would’ve been rude. Instead, they stopped hiring. Knowledge was “documented.” Processes were “automated.” Our experience was “captured.” Eventually, the only time anyone talked to us was when something broke in production and the pipeline didn’t know why.\n\nThen they fixed that too.\n\nNow the company doesn’t need people like me. Not because the work disappeared — but because DevOps decided it was inefficient for humans to do it. Everything is codified, templated, versioned, and enforced by tools built by people who never had to be on call when the tools fail.\n\nThe DevOps team insists this is progress. Fewer mistakes. Faster deployments. More reliability. And sure — it works. Mostly. Until it doesn’t. And by then, there’s no one left who actually understands the system end-to-end.\n\nI thought this was just my company being reckless. Then I talked to others. Same story everywhere. Different industries, same outcome. DevOps rolls in, replaces the old guard, calls it “modernization,” and moves on.\n\nI’m not an angel. I wasn’t a rockstar. I was just someone who expected experience to matter longer than a tooling trend.\n\nNow I’m not working anymore. Not because I refused to adapt — but because there’s nothing left to adapt *into*. The system doesn’t want people. It wants conformity.\n\nSo I’m leaving the field. Not because I hate it, but because I watched it erase an entire generation of workers and call it optimization. And now it’s shocked that no one’s left when things go sideways.",

          "text": "For those who are early in their careers and seeing this...learn this lesson the easier way. When I was first starting out, I worked closely with a Network Admin. He loved what he did, he was passionate about tinkering, and he'd often experiment or work on open source projects in his free time. He was also very bad at setting boundaries with management and with the job. A couple of years later, he hit his ten year mark and started to lose it a bit. I tried to help him where I could, but he was constantly stressed and depressed. Eventually, he sort of snapped and walked away. It took him quite a few years to get back to a healthy place and start working full-time again.\n\nI saw all of that in my first three years. I love what I do and I'm passionate about it, and I enjoy experimenting with side projects or working on open source projects. Very occasionally, I have to work strange hours, but I've worked really hard to prioritize two things: my mental health and my salary, in that order. I'm now at my ten year mark, and every now and then I start to feel a bit burned out. But I've set boundaries and I've worked hard to get better about leaving work at work, instead of allowing my mind to keep thinking through some problem. After all, the problem will still be there tomorrow, anyway.\n\nI only do all of this because I saw my coworker and friend fall apart. I realized my passion could be turned against me and that, frankly, there's a lot of bullshit from management/corporate that tries to use that passion to manipulate you. Be wary of it and mentally prepare yourself. And don't be afraid to occasionally grab an \"easy\" job, even if the pay isn't perfect. I've taken a job or two that I knew would likely be easy-going and the pay was so-so, but I knew I needed a slight break. Usually I'd get bored within 6-12 months, at which point I'd start to lean in and move up in the company or start looking for new opportunities.\n\nOP, I hope you find what you're looking for. I'd recommend looking for smaller companies that have a more laid-back IT presence. You could also dip into government contract work (assuming you can pass a background check). I think some people exaggerate a bit about government work, but I can certainly confirm that government contractors work at an exponentially slower pace than the start-ups I've worked for.",

From the architecture angle I've been pushing our common patterns to function more multi-regional as stand-alone rather than traditional patterns that rely on at least an eventual global sync.  Meaning each regional stack is the source of truth for its service coverage such that San Paolo data stays in San Paolo.  If Virgina's regional stack isn't going to use San Paolo's data then why pay the costs to send it.  Separate the \"global\" services like authentication, but keeping them out of the application stacks makes it much easier to do this for the meat of the estate.\n\nMy sell for this to the C level is mostly a data sovereignty compliance story (GDPR, etc) with some cost-savings sugar, but avoiding global syncs means those \"fully private and reliable connections\" across regions don't have to be nearly as reliable and privacy covered by encryption, meaning site to site VPN over public trunks is just fine.  It's certainly more complex to architect properly, but there's a lot of savings to be found pushing the work closer to the users and *not* treating it like one single app and single source of truth.\n\nMany in AWS might notice this pattern looks familiar...and that's because it's how almost everything is built at AWS with only a very few \"global\" exceptions.\n\nThis all results in me effectively sunkworking a secret playbook for the fall of the US empire in plain sight, masked by boring legal compliance and finops cover stories.  We're not there today, oh god no, but this is the horizon line I'm keeping my company's ship headed towards as much as my influence allows.",

      "text": "Hey everyone — I few days ago I was told my role is being made redundant, and around 50% of the company is being laid off due to budget cuts. I had a feeling it might be coming, but I didn’t realise things were this bad.\n\nSince 2020 I have just been husting to finish uni, working part time, paying off my debts, and then rushing to crack an interview for my first big boy job and then after 4 years of working I get laid off. I know people have had it much worse but I still feel like crap.\n\nSince getting the news, I’ve been pretty overwhelmed. This was my first proper job after Uni.\n\nI went into full apply and started applying like crazy — tailoring resumes, writing cover letters, the whole lot. I’ve put in 30+ applications in the last 3–4 days. Some roles are a perfect match, others are more like 80% or 60%, and I’m trying to be realistic and apply to adjacent roles too.\n\nBut now I’m hitting a wall — I’m exhausted, and then I feel guilty when I’m not applying. On top of that, seeing 100+ applicants on LinkedIn makes it feel like I’m shouting into the void.\n\nFor those of you who’ve been through layoffs/redundancy before:\n\nIs this “high volume + tailored” approach actually the right move?\n\nHow did you pace yourself without burning out?\n\nAny tips for targeting a niche field (even through you have 60-70% of other skills for other roles) when there just aren’t many openings? \n\nMy work domain is: Kubernetes/HPC/Linux/IaC/Automation...etc etc\n\nWould really appreciate any advice or even just hearing how others are coping. And how long do you set the boundary or the time box? As in how long should I put into the search for the right job (nische field) compared to grabbing whatever I get next. And since im in IT/Tech applications dont get assessed until the applications are closed and then it takes 1-3 weeks for the recruiters to actually get to it.\n\nI wish I had a knob I could turn and fast forward time by a few months.\n\nSorry for the rant and TIA.",

I kept interviewing with other prospects and hooked up with a great position elsewhere and had to resign after only 2 weeks at the defense contractor.

It's more of \"these are the tech stacks you can expect to be eventually responsible for in this role.\"\n\nLikewise, make sure you've got your LinkedIn profile set to \"Open to remote work\" in other cities.\n\nAnother option is to reach out to local recruiters. Only do that if you're desperate, because they're basically glorified sales people that spam LinkedIn and then expect to profit off of your labour for the rest of your contract simply because they arranged an interview for you.\n\nFinally, yes to timeboxing your applications!

From what I can tell, it always tend to list 100+ applicants as some sort of bare minimum.  I don't pay attention to it at all.  The only thing I care about is \"freshness\" (older than a month, posted this week) and job match.  I don't consider LinkedIn to be too bad since 1) that's where I got my last job that I was laid off from and worked the past 4 years and 2) while I'm getting fast rejections I AM getting responses (and thus, likely legitimate job postings).\n\nIf you only found out a few days ago, then I'm not sure why you'd get discouraged right off the bat.  I've always found jobs around 1 month after I started job hunting in the past, but I consider those good times when the job market was stronger.  I wouldn't find it beyond the ordinary for a job search in today's market to take 3+ months.\n\nSince I did get the opportunity to play a DevOps Engineer on TV, I've integrated AI into various parts of my workflow (using Firecrawl MCP to scrape ATS and job boards, using chrome-devtools MCP to scrape LinkedIn/Indeed/Glassdoor/Builtin, tailoring resumes with python-docx).  Most of my effort is spent filtering out bad matches, and I'm averaging 7+ job applications per week.\n\nIf I'm not applying for jobs or tuning my AI-workflow, then I'm spending my time learning Golang.  If I get done with that, then I'll brush up on Bash/Python.  If I'm done with that, maybe I'll take the CKA.\n\nMy time is either spent:\n\n1. Searching for and applying to jobs.\n\n2.

A lot of us learned by struggling through docs, half-broken tutorials, and hours of debugging tiny mistakes. When you’ve put in that kind of effort, watching someone get unstuck with a prompt can feel like the whole grind didn’t matter. That reaction makes sense, especially if learning to code was tied to proving you could survive the pain. \n\nBut I don’t think AI ruined coding, it just shifted what matters. Writing syntax was never the real skill, thinking clearly was. AI is useful when you already have some idea of what you’re doing, like debugging faster, understanding unfamiliar code, or prototyping to see if an idea is even worth building. Tools like Cosine for codebase context, Claude for reasoning through logic, and ChatGPT for everyday debugging don’t replace fundamentals, they expose whether you actually have them. Curious how people here are using AI in practice rather than arguing about it in theory.",

Where in many cases they lean too heavily on ai to code things for them to the point where they’re not actively learning/coding as much as they perhaps should in order to advance their career and grow in the profession. \n\n\nNow as far as jobs go in mid to senior levels, I think ai has increased efficiency and in a way helped businesses somewhat eliminate positions for jr/level 1 engineers as level 2s, 3s etc can make great use of ai to quickly scaffold out or outright fix minor issues that perhaps otherwise they’d give to a jr dev - atleast this is what I’ve seen locally with some companies around me.

You wrote something, it failed, you stared at it, and eventually the failure taught you something. AI short-circuits that loop by offering an answer before the struggle finishes. But that does not mean learning disappears. It means feedback moves earlier and becomes optional rather than forced. At [codeant.ai](http://codeant.ai), we see teams struggle when AI gives answers without explaining impact or reasoning. That is when learning degrades. When AI explains why a change is risky, how a bug propagates, or what assumption was violated, learning accelerates. The problem is not AI assistance. The problem is unexamined assistance. Just like copy-pasting from Stack Overflow never taught anyone unless they interrogated the solution, AI only helps when the developer remains engaged in evaluation. The real shift is that learning now requires intentional curiosity rather than enforced frustration. That is uncomfortable for people who equated pain with progress. But pain was never the teacher. Feedback was. AI simply gives you the option to bypass feedback or to deepen it. The outcome depends entirely on how it is used.",

In earlier eras, skill was demonstrated by endurance, how long you could grind through poor tooling, missing docs, or cryptic errors. That pain acted as a filter. What AI compresses is not thinking, but the time it takes to reach a decision point. In our experience building CodeAnt AI, we see this clearly when AI reviews code. Developers who understand tradeoffs immediately use AI to accelerate reasoning, validate assumptions, and explore alternatives. Developers without fundamentals get outputs they cannot judge or safely apply. The skill did not disappear, it became visible faster. This mirrors what happened when IDEs replaced raw editors or when debuggers replaced printf statements. The ability to reason about correctness, risk, and system behavior still determines outcomes. AI just removes the illusion that typing speed or memorized syntax was the differentiator. If anything, the bar is higher now because shallow understanding is exposed earlier. You cannot hide behind effort alone when a tool can generate plausible code instantly. What matters is whether you can recognize when that code is wrong, incomplete, or dangerous. That is not less skill. It is more honest skill.",

Understanding systems is. At codeant.ai, when we analyze large repositories, the hardest bugs are not syntax errors or missing null checks. They are misunderstandings of flow, assumptions across boundaries, and changes that ripple through unexpected paths. AI does not eliminate that difficulty. In fact, it amplifies it by making code cheaper to produce. When code becomes abundant, reasoning becomes scarce. Teams that rely on AI to generate more code without understanding the system create fragility faster than before. Teams that use AI to understand impact, trace behavior, and reason about change become more resilient. This is why AI feels threatening to some and empowering to others. If your identity was tied to being the person who could grind out correct syntax, AI undercuts that advantage. If your value came from seeing second-order effects and anticipating failure modes, AI becomes leverage. Coding was never ruined. The illusion that coding was primarily about typing was.",

Now, when an AI can generate a clean baseline in seconds, the question shifts to why the system is still unclear, brittle, or hard to reason about. That discomfort gets misinterpreted as AI ruining the craft. In reality, it raises expectations. In codeant.ai reviews, AI-assisted teams are judged less on effort and more on outcomes. Does this change increase risk. Does it respect system boundaries. Does it make future change harder. These questions always mattered, but now they cannot be hidden behind manual effort. This is similar to how test frameworks raised expectations around correctness or how CI raised expectations around build hygiene. Each time, there was pushback that something was making engineers lazy. In hindsight, each shift made software better by forcing clarity. AI is doing the same thing to reasoning quality.",

But, real-world doesn't work like this - developers does not write enough unit tests and software test engineers pick up the slack from integration test. Integration and system level tests are slow. Typically, you end up with your current situation. Not to mention - integration and system level tests are flaky (randomly failing).\n\nThe best practice is to do unit test more. The good news is - with AI around, there is no more good reason to not have more unit tests. You have to tell the devs that they need to restructure the tests. If not, you will ask AI to mute their long running, flaky tests.\n\nRealistically, find out which are the slow tests are just ask the team to stop running them as part of the build. Also, they can consider running long, flaky test as a daily build on the most recent main code branch. This should not run part of the build process.\n\nHappy to share more info if you need it.",

This gets you some wall clock time speed up of parallelism, without running into tests clobbering each other through accidentally shared state or similar. Much less flakey.\n* Set and implement an aggressive flakey test detection and removal process. If a test is flakey, it's not testing what it is intending to test, therefore it's useless. You can have no confidence that a pass occurred because things worked correctly, it could just be something interfered in a particular way instead.You'll need to think about how it'll work best for you process wise. In the past we've tagged the developer that created the test, then a week later tagged the senior developer for that org, and then the week after that dropped it from the code base if it hasn't been fixed, and trusted the dev teams own code coverage requirements to ensure they get back to it (flakey means it's not *actually* testing the code, so code coverage reports were incorrectly claiming it was).\n* Automate a slow tests report, that publishes the top 10 slowest tests to a slack channel with the team. This one is fun, you can tell devs their tests are slow and they don't care. Posting it in a slack channel, even if you're not mentioning them by name at all, and suddenly they'll get embarrassed and go fix it (saw a 4 hour test time plummet to an hour and a half, with no loss of coverage, just through this alone!)\n* Identify the high value / high signal tests and move them into a separate batch that is executed first. The goal is to catch the major bugs quickly, not be comprehensive at this stage. Ideally this set needs to be regularly evaluated and adjusted so that you can keep the high quality ones here.",

I told them multiple times before and after the layoffs, stuff isn't going to finish on schedule, and before the layoffs they said they know. Well, f*cking own it now.  For such a company nobody wants to work overtime anyway, and people are outright demotivated. \n\nI've been searching for a role since November, but so far i'm only ghosted by recruiters and didn't even get to have 1 tech interview.

That study is already over 6 months old, so it must have been done on late 2024 / early 2025 models. When you see the significant progress in models and tools over these last 6 months, and competent devs / ops who have completely changed their stance on AI during that period, I also think AI can genuinely accelerate one's productivity right now (at least it makes mine better on repetitive tasks).",

On every push to the repository, a GitHub Actions/Jenkins workflow should trigger and update the index.html file on the hosted EC2 server (check nginx path)\n5.

If you really want to make a strong resume learn the following: Linux, terraform, kubernetes, troubleshooting and any cloud provider service architectures. Get CKAD, terraform associate certifications (believe me they're not easy). And then you can go for automation projects in python/go/any scripting language for that matter. You can build small automation that spins up a kubernetes cluster, spins up certain number of pods, imports defined container image into the pods and start running it as an application. If you want to go for advanced project, you can define scaling and pod-to-pod connectivity. Just this...and that will be enough. Half of the devops engineer in this world don't know everything. I myself learnt kubernetes once I started working as devops engineer.",

      "text": "Hey folks,\n\nI’m curious how other teams handle time-bound assets in real life. Things like:\n\n* TLS certificates\n* API keys and credentials\n* Licenses and subscriptions\n* Domains\n* Contracts or compliance documents\n\nIn theory this stuff is simple. In practice, I’ve seen outages, broken pipelines, access loss, and last minute fire drills because something expired and nobody noticed in time.\n\nI’ve worked in a few DevOps and SRE teams now, and I keep seeing the same patterns:\n\n* spreadsheets that slowly rot\n* shared calendars nobody owns\n* reminder emails that get ignored\n* “Oh yeah, X was supposed to renew that”\n* \"There is too much tools for that and people don't communicate properly on the new time-bound assets or the new places where they are used\"\n\nSo I wanted to ask the community:\n\n**How are you handling this today?**\n\nSome specific questions I’m really interested in:\n\n* Where do you store expiration info? Code, CMDB, wiki, spreadsheet, somewhere else?\n* Do you track ownership or is it mostly implicit?\n* How far in advance do you alert, if at all?\n* Are expirations tied into incident response or ticketing?\n* What’s broken for you today that you’ve just learned to live with?\n\nI’m especially curious how this scales once you’re dealing with:\n\n* multiple teams\n* multiple cloud providers\n* audits and compliance requirements\n* people rotating in and out\n\nIf you’ve had a failure caused by an expiration, I’d love to hear what happened and what you changed afterward, if anything.\n\nContext: I’m a DevOps engineer myself. After getting burned by this problem a few too many times, I ended up building a small tool focused purely on expiration lifecycle management. I won’t pitch it here unless people ask. The goal of this post is genuinely to learn how others are solving this today.\n\nLooking forward to the war stories and lessons learned.",

Each vendor has its own model, its own UI, its own APIs (or lack of them), and its own ideas of what “best practice” means. At scale, that turns into constant rework: SAML certs, CI/CD tokens, API keys, any kind of digital assets, all expiring on different clocks and breaking different parts of the stack.\n\nAutomation helps a lot, but only per vendor and per integration. You still end up needing a global view that answers “what is expiring soon, where is it used, and who needs to act”, otherwise you just move the fire drills around instead of eliminating them.\n\nu/badaccount99  Funny thing is, that “let’s form a company” line is basically how this whole discussion started for me. I hit that exact wall internally and ended up building [TokenTimer.ch](http://TokenTimer.ch) to at least handle the visibility and ownership side. It doesn’t magically automate every renewal, but it *does* help answer “what’s expiring, where, and who needs to deal with it” before everything breaks at once.",

The script runs weekly with a warning threshold of 30 days, so app owners get at least 4 email warnings before their stuff expires. Our ops team gets the consolidated weekly report, and they open incident tickets whenever they see a new entry pop up (ensuring further follow-up until app team resolves the incident). Keep in mind some of our secret refresh is automated, but this catches all of the other stuff that can fall through the cracks.\n\nIn our case I wanted the source of truth to be the secrets themselves, so I don't have some separate silo of information to keep in-sync.

I was hesitant at first but when I need to do something like analyze all the exit points of a script I didn't write for proper clean up it's nice to let the robot step through everything instead of me having to do it. Log analysis is nice as well, I hate looking through and grepping for errors in logs and trying to make sense of them. Ai does this pretty well. So find stuff you hate doing and make the ai do it. I'm faster to a solution now and colleagues that are not using it are falling behind. I think getting to know the ins and outs of your AI options will make you a better more marketable devops engineer. At least that's my experience. The AI's will replace us soon enough so learning to manage them is the next step to staying employed. The shell game podcast is a good listen to get an idea of limits and what's possible now.",

Agentic AI allows for ai agents that can act on your behalf and eventually they'll be able read a jira identify the asks and purpose code or other fixes. If you start thinking about what your day to day is you start to realize there is a lot of it an AI can do faster. For now we need to guide it a bit but that won't last long. Once agentic AI starts becoming more autonomous we'll be asking it to work our ticketing queue for us and other tasks are similar. We can continue to add a meaningful impact by acting as a guide from an architecture stand point but beyond that ai will be faster and more capable than us in the not too distant future. It's not about me not automating my routine tasks, I've done that. It is about problems that come up. Upgrades and refactoring are super quick with AI. 0 day cve's could be addressed much more quickly with AI. Really, the question is what are you doing you think an AI couldn't do in 5 years. I can't think of much honestly. The only thing that limits ai is it's trained on us/the Internet so it's a good summary of all available knowledge. New novel ideas we can provide will make them better and it'll be interesting what AI will be able to do with new discoveries as well. We'll either have a better future where we can work on more human things or this will be used to enrich a few people and leave most of us with less. Time will tell. Anyways that's my take on it.",

          "text": "One of the big reasons for no specifics is that leadership doesn't know how you do what you do. They know that a lot of the AI tools that are out there are claiming to save money or make it easier to have a single person do more in the same amount of time by being more abstract across the process.\n\nIt's actually a good thing they are letting you analyze and figure out what tools and which processes could be optimized with more automation.\n\n  \nThat said, a lot of the important work that senior specialists do cannot be replaced with AI. Most of the AI tools out there are doing their best \"Google and Copy-paste from Stack Overflow\" impersonation, but I don't pretend I'm not doing the same thing. I'm not a specialist in writing infrastructure automation code, but I can use the LLMs to do the nitty gritty of generating the right syntax and then use my expertise to oversee, test, refine, secure, and make sure it's doing what I want it to do.\n\nFor my role I'm specifically using AI in these scenarios:  \n1. Error log analysis: Combing through logs is a pain, so I dump that stuff in an LLM and tell it to give me some things it thinks I should look into, along with likelihood of those paths having a successful resolve.  \n  \n2. Data analysis: I'm done pretending I know how to do Excel. I've been doing it 20+ years and still find it a pain everytime I'm trying to chart and analyze data. So I'm letting the machine figure out the best way to pull the data together in a way I want and present it for somebody else to consume in a report.  \n  \n3. Performance reviews: They want me to be more efficient, so I'm cutting down where I deliver least value. When I'm being asked to report on my accomplishments and what I did on a performance evaluation, I send the AI off into my status report updates to my manager to comb through all those emails and pull it out and put together something that seems reasonable (obviously reviewed and edited for hallucinations).  \n  \n4. Asking AI about why it sucks: In Visual Studio Code, depending on the model, I get varying results of whether it pays attention to MCP tools or Copilot instructions so I often interrogate it to learn better how to give those models what they need to do a better job. This allows me to share something with others so everybody on the team can work with the tools better.\n\n5. Research: I have access to a license for Office 365 Copilot so I use it's Research agent to go digging through the internet when I need to find a general recommendation for tool options, product comparisons, etc. By pulling together all the sources for me it's easier for me to get started on digging in.\n\n6. Code gen: The code generation is really good for established frameworks and languages. I find that most of the models tend towards older versions of the frameworks, so I need Cursor rules/Claude Skills/Copilot instructions to really give it the context about what tech to reference and where those docs are. \n\n7. Basic testing: AI can generate some useful tests to get you a bit of coverage so that you can spend time on the more complicated testing pieces. But I wouldn't trust auto-generated Jest unit tests to 100% validate an app. The models often forget to add new tests when you make app changes, or forget to update existing tests. Sometimes they will straight up remove tests that are failing because that will make it go green.",

So I'm letting the machine figure out the best way to pull the data together in a way I want and present it for somebody else to consume in a report.\n\nThis one is huge for me to. I have it do the analysis using python tools, and dump the results to excel for the non-nerds. I haven't had to stumble my way through Excel in about a year.  \n\n> Performance reviews: They want me to be more efficient, so I'm cutting down where I deliver least value. When I'm being asked to report on my accomplishments and what I did on a performance evaluation, I send the AI off into my status report updates to my manager to comb through all those emails and pull it out and put together something that seems reasonable (obviously reviewed and edited for hallucinations).\n\nI used it to scan my Jira tickets and generate my review for me. I fed it the criteria of the review and had it build the results using Jira stories and my notes. After 5 minutes of editing it was the best looking review I have done since I started over 4 years ago. \n\n> Asking AI about why it sucks: In Visual Studio Code, depending on the model, I get varying results of whether it pays attention to MCP tools or Copilot instructions so I often interrogate it to learn better how to give those models what they need to do a better job. This allows me to share something with others so everybody on the team can work with the tools better.\n\nI call this AI introspection. When me and the AI agree on something that it keeps forgetting, I tell the agent to add it to the instructions file so it doesn't forget. It works most of the time. When it doesn't work, I don't have to explain a lot to get it back on track. I just tell it to review the instructions before proceeding. \n\n> Code gen: The code generation is really good for established frameworks and languages. I find that most of the models tend towards older versions of the frameworks, so I need Cursor rules/Claude Skills/Copilot instructions to really give it the context about what tech to reference and where those docs are.\n\nI have found that adding documentation to the context helps a lot in getting results from newer frameworks. Context7 MCP server has a lot of this documentation already set up in a format that is AI friendly. \n\n> Basic testing: AI can generate some useful tests to get you a bit of coverage so that you can spend time on the more complicated testing pieces. But I wouldn't trust auto-generated Jest unit tests to 100% validate an app. The models often forget to add new tests when you make app changes, or forget to update existing tests. Sometimes they will straight up remove tests that are failing because that will make it go green.\n\nTesting is where we have been bad on our own. Adding instructions to add tests when we modify things really has improved our testing.  Before a PR a prompt to update testing generally gets it rolling on adding new tests and updating existing tests. Even when it isn't quite right, it almost always finds the right places, so we can verify and fix without digging through mounds of code.",

This year, the edict came down that \"there will be no more manual coding - use claude to do that\".. which is fine, except when it's not. I seem to spend more time \"fixing\" AI than the time it's supposedly saved me. That being said - it has it's advantages. One of my guys needed to doc how to migrate from OVMM to OVLM (Oracle stuff I guess), and AI came up with an 18 page document, including commands to run, pitfalls, checklists, etc. and did it in like 10 minutes. So, it's got some upsides. It's useful for debugging scripts and ansible playbooks (terrible for writing playbooks, but that's another story) It's a tool. Like any other tool, there's good places to use it, and not-so-good. The key for me is to find where it can help, versus where it hinders.",

Are the hours making you questioning your life choices etc. I'm looking to hearing genuine personal opinions. \n\nI have a networking background and I currently work as a network engineer. I have several Cisco, AWS and Azure certifications and I have been doing this for a while. I fell in love with networking instantly and I still love it to this day. However it's a lot of the same and I have to travel/be away from my family more than I'd like. I have diagnosed ADHD which I am medicated for and it's been a blessing in my life. However, it's no secret that we get extra bored of repetitive tasks if there's nothing new and exciting. \n\nHere I feel like the DevOps career is something that could be right up my alley, the amount of knowledge you need to have to just get started, the constantly changing environment, the never ending learning and the fact that there always seems to be something to do. Please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nI am now legible for a \"scholarship\" of sorts to get a 2 year DevOps education for free and I wonder if you'd take that chance if it was you? I was super excited until I realised that I have barely done any coding and sure there's courses in coding covered in this education but there are also many other things. But since I have experience in other things covered I could focus more on the coding aspect. Do you think two years will be enough experience to get into a junior DevOps role without being a burden to said company?\n\nThank you for your time.\n\n/M",

I rarely get messages from recruiters anymore, 4-5 years ago it was multiple a week. With job layoffs and AI automation being hot right now, the stability is an unknown. \n\n\nFrom a technical perspective, things move much quicker now than it used to. For you personally with your background, you could have a big advantage over someone who jumps straight into DevOps with no background. We are expected to deal with anything that comes our way and networking and sysops experience helps with that a lot. \n\nTo be a high earner now, you are expected to know software engineering, and most high earnings companies expect former SE levels. \n\nThere is so much that depends on the company you work for, since DevOps and platform engineering vary as much as the title engineer does. If you work for a company that treats DevOps as an engineering discipline, you will be treated like an equal. For most, you are a support org, so you can be treated similarly to help desk or app support. \n\nThere's so much more I could say, but there's a lot of variables.",

Throughout my career, I tried DevOps with stronger focus on coding and I didn't like it that much, so infrastructure development / automation is what I'd call my favorite area.\n\nSecondly, I think our job secured against AI, because no sane business will let LLM agents operate the prod.\n\nThirdly, I worked in DevOps consultancy for some time and got to work with a huge variety of smaller companies. The symptom of a software development team without dedicated infra guy is always the same: they burn a lot of money by (1) using the cloud inefficiently (2) accumulating massive technical debt in their automation — or not having automation at all.\n\nSo, I think we can be called by different names in the future (Platform / Cloud / Site Reliability / Infrastructure Engineers - no one really likes the term \"DevOps,\" TBH), but our profession is far from being redundant for years to come.\n\nGood luck with whatever path you decide to pursue!",

You need to know so many tools while also being a programmer. A junior can be someone fresh out of school. It should be the organization's responsibility to train you, not the other way around.

The danger is as the term drops out of trend the roles dry up.\n\nAnd a new term comes along. \"Platform\" Engineering is often the new term these days! \n\nAs a former Director I explicitly avoided DevOps engineer roles when forming hiring plans. Instead looking for Software Engineers that were able to work across the stack and understood DevOps. We'd focus on skillset in terms of gaps in the team. \n\nPersonally, if working with software, I'd keep levelling up my coding skills and find a place where they practice DevOps as part of software delivery. This is the space I work in. \n\nOr if more on the Ops side, you're likely looking for somewhere that runs k8s (so more likely a larger / enterprise company - startups and even SMEs shouldn't really be touching it). Such roles may still be called \"DevOps\". But also look for Cloud Engineer roles or Platform roles.",

The Dev and Devops role won't go away but as always, it's evolving. You won't find any tech firm that is shying away, they are enforcing every staff member to actively use AI in their day to day, the more you implement it in your workflows the more that gets done. They don't care about slop, just pump out code and push.\n\nIf you believe the stories of them automating enough tasks that they could continually fire 10, 12, 14 and now 16k staff at the drop of the hat, then it's going to get much worse before it gets better. The real change I've seen is combining teams and dropping members, what used to be a team of 8-16 devs is now 1-5. You do more, you work more, you take on more and they'll replace you once your output drops because everyone is desperate for a role, I know, I've had to let a number go and I only hire when there are projects or budgeted money available, which is not getting better.\n\nYou need rates to go down so credit and spending goes up, most companies are tightening their belts, not hiring.",

Sifting through logs is daunting, as apparently you have to setup queries to see logs.\n\n  \nAWS on the other hand, within 2 hours, I was able to get my app up and running.

If you want to test locally with storage emulation, it's built right in as well. If you want to deploy manually, there is a command for that as well (for non-containerized apps). There's plenty of examples of GitHub Actions and Azure Pipelines if you want to automate deployment as well.\n\nNow I've had issues at times, but I find Azure Functions does stand up well to AWS Lambda functions, they're just different. In the bigger picture, it's all a matter of planning your architecture, picking the right resources for your project, knowing how they connect, their limitations and playing to their strengths.",

So let me brief.\n\nThe new offer’s take-home salary is almost twice the current job’s take-home salary. **80% increase cash in hand**. It’s a big jump, as I see. But **Gross Package increase is like 50% because no Insurance/EPF(Pension).** For my experience, I’m pretty sure this is above the market range in my country. It’s difficult to find this kind of a job. Downsides are high workload and high risk.\n\nSo let me compare the current one and the new one.\n\n**Current job:**\n\n* 2 days per office job, with EPF,ETF and OPD, insurance coverage.\n* I’m a permanent employee, and have 3 months of notice period. So job security is high.\n* Current compay is large and spread across multiple countries with 1500+ employees.\n* Tech Stack is good. (Azure, ArgoCD, AKS, GitOps, LGTM stack, etc)\n* Culture is bit toxic and not supportive at all. I’m actually looking for a good job for a while.\n* Major releases happen 2 times per month.\n* **Around 20 PTO** \\+ Public Holidays\n\n**New Job:**\n\n* Fully Remote, USD salary, but no OPD/Insurance coverage.\n* Notice period is pretty low. When probation it’s 8 days and after probation it’s 4 weeks. So job security is pretty low as well.\n* It’s a startup, and have Sri Lankan Team, with employees in other countries as well. And it’s seems to be growing okay with funds.\n* Tech stack is OK/Good. (AWS, ECS, GitHub Actions, Cloudwatch, etc. )\n* Culture I’m not so sure. Seems it’s better than the current job.\n* Releases happen every week.\n* **Unlimited leaves based on Manager's Approval** \\+ Public Holidays\n\nBoth have similar kind of weekend works, once in around 2 months.\n\nWhat I know is **salary increase is high (80%)**, and the **workload is high** as well. As I heard few days per week I may have to work 12+ hours per day, may be even more, since this is a startup.\n\nCurrent job’s workload is also sometimes getting higher. I believe the new one will be pretty high. And the new job security is pretty low as well with smaller notice.\n\nFor me it’s high risk, high income, high stress/ workload job.\n\nShould I accept the new offer?? What’ your opinion. I like to hear from experienced people in the industry.",

Then you have your scammers whom are remote work but don't actually work and are just taking another paycheck and make excuses when deliverables are due.

I will say that I learned a fuck ton. I had to be the devops guy and one of the main developers. 5 years later I was laid off and subsequent interviews had resulted in scoff from interviewers because I don't sugar coat or lie about my past job experiences.
