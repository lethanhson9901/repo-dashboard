Looks like a ticking bomb to me, as there won't be any security patches.\n\nTL;DR: Maintainers have been publicly asking for help since 2022. Four years. Nobody showed up. Now they're pulling the plug.\n\nIt's not that easy to know if you are running it. There's no drop-in replacement, and a migration can take quite a bit of work.\n\nHere is the interview if you want to learn more [https://thelandsca.pe/2026/01/29/half-of-kubernetes-clusters-are-about-to-lose-security-updates/](https://thelandsca.pe/2026/01/29/half-of-kubernetes-clusters-are-about-to-lose-security-updates/)",

          "text": "For those who are early in their careers and seeing this...learn this lesson the easier way. When I was first starting out, I worked closely with a Network Admin. He loved what he did, he was passionate about tinkering, and he'd often experiment or work on open source projects in his free time. He was also very bad at setting boundaries with management and with the job. A couple of years later, he hit his ten year mark and started to lose it a bit. I tried to help him where I could, but he was constantly stressed and depressed. Eventually, he sort of snapped and walked away. It took him quite a few years to get back to a healthy place and start working full-time again.\n\nI saw all of that in my first three years. I love what I do and I'm passionate about it, and I enjoy experimenting with side projects or working on open source projects. Very occasionally, I have to work strange hours, but I've worked really hard to prioritize two things: my mental health and my salary, in that order. I'm now at my ten year mark, and every now and then I start to feel a bit burned out. But I've set boundaries and I've worked hard to get better about leaving work at work, instead of allowing my mind to keep thinking through some problem. After all, the problem will still be there tomorrow, anyway.\n\nI only do all of this because I saw my coworker and friend fall apart. I realized my passion could be turned against me and that, frankly, there's a lot of bullshit from management/corporate that tries to use that passion to manipulate you. Be wary of it and mentally prepare yourself. And don't be afraid to occasionally grab an \"easy\" job, even if the pay isn't perfect. I've taken a job or two that I knew would likely be easy-going and the pay was so-so, but I knew I needed a slight break. Usually I'd get bored within 6-12 months, at which point I'd start to lean in and move up in the company or start looking for new opportunities.\n\nOP, I hope you find what you're looking for. I'd recommend looking for smaller companies that have a more laid-back IT presence. You could also dip into government contract work (assuming you can pass a background check). I think some people exaggerate a bit about government work, but I can certainly confirm that government contractors work at an exponentially slower pace than the start-ups I've worked for.",

Now they have changed this strategy, but they moved to a slightly more fair pay for what you use strategy again mostly. Paying for ingest makes sense, however our new issues are with queries. We are now charged for these, a single dashboard for query to try and identify a root cause can go through such a large quantity of data and add up extremely quick. We have tried, but we were given zero ways to optimize these queries as we only ran into their platform limitations and they really just want us to pay. Again as an observability company, they seem to have zero interest in obseravability.  \n\\- Their UI brings even modern PCs to their kness, dashboards being the worst. We also struggled to get it to asign users tot he correct accounts if a user had multiple orgs assigned. So they constantly logged in and saw the wrong data, which was easy to change once they realised, but frustrating  \n\\- Their account managers for our region have all left and we were given an overseas team who simply did not care about our business, only signing the next years contract.\n\nThis is a competitive space, NR seems like they have a lot to offer, but they stopped major innovation a while back, many competitors are hungry for that market share now.",

It's not a question of if we leave, it's a question of how quickly we can make it happen.\n\nWhy are we looking to leave?  Steep price hikes, very few valuable new features, and lots of questionable redesigns (only one of them positive, the  tabs in the query view).  Their observability for Kubernetes started out terrible and has not improved in the slightest... and that's been an ongoing painpoint. \n\nI still think NRQL is the best observability query language I've seen though... but I'm willing to deal with the alternatives if it means a longer-term viable platform.

      "text": "Hey everyone — I few days ago I was told my role is being made redundant, and around 50% of the company is being laid off due to budget cuts. I had a feeling it might be coming, but I didn’t realise things were this bad.\n\nSince 2020 I have just been husting to finish uni, working part time, paying off my debts, and then rushing to crack an interview for my first big boy job and then after 4 years of working I get laid off. I know people have had it much worse but I still feel like crap.\n\nSince getting the news, I’ve been pretty overwhelmed. This was my first proper job after Uni.\n\nI went into full apply and started applying like crazy — tailoring resumes, writing cover letters, the whole lot. I’ve put in 30+ applications in the last 3–4 days. Some roles are a perfect match, others are more like 80% or 60%, and I’m trying to be realistic and apply to adjacent roles too.\n\nBut now I’m hitting a wall — I’m exhausted, and then I feel guilty when I’m not applying. On top of that, seeing 100+ applicants on LinkedIn makes it feel like I’m shouting into the void.\n\nFor those of you who’ve been through layoffs/redundancy before:\n\nIs this “high volume + tailored” approach actually the right move?\n\nHow did you pace yourself without burning out?\n\nAny tips for targeting a niche field (even through you have 60-70% of other skills for other roles) when there just aren’t many openings? \n\nMy work domain is: Kubernetes/HPC/Linux/IaC/Automation...etc etc\n\nWould really appreciate any advice or even just hearing how others are coping. And how long do you set the boundary or the time box? As in how long should I put into the search for the right job (nische field) compared to grabbing whatever I get next. And since im in IT/Tech applications dont get assessed until the applications are closed and then it takes 1-3 weeks for the recruiters to actually get to it.\n\nI wish I had a knob I could turn and fast forward time by a few months.\n\nSorry for the rant and TIA.",

It took a while of course and I may have been hasty about decisions like accepting lower positions or jobs that might not be part of my desired tech stack and I took a job with a HUGE defense company which required me to commute an hour back and forth daily to a very sad and depressing office in a very depressing suburb and for a company who profits on war. I kept interviewing with other prospects and hooked up with a great position elsewhere and had to resign after only 2 weeks at the defense contractor. Best move but I felt awkward for being on job for 2 weeks and bailing . That next job lasted 4 yrs and propelled me  even higher to my next role, which then propelled me to the one after that.  Don’t panic and don’t pigeonhole yourself for too long keep the momentum .",

APPLY for the jobs you'd feel comfortable doing, apply even for things that you might not particularly have an experience with, but are close enough for you to catch up (eg. learning different cloud platform than you used to work with).

Hiring companies will ‘make do’ with people who lack some of what a job ad is asking for, if that person can show/indicate high proficiency in the things that matter.

They're not expecting you to have all of those skills (and I would say having 60-70% of the skills is what they're actually looking for). It's more of \"these are the tech stacks you can expect to be eventually responsible for in this role.\"\n\nLikewise, make sure you've got your LinkedIn profile set to \"Open to remote work\" in other cities.\n\nAnother option is to reach out to local recruiters. Only do that if you're desperate, because they're basically glorified sales people that spam LinkedIn and then expect to profit off of your labour for the rest of your contract simply because they arranged an interview for you.\n\nFinally, yes to timeboxing your applications! While you've got the downtime, use this freedom to reboot your physical and mental health.

I also respond to recruiters even if I'm not interested the role they're advertising. Just thank them for reaching out, say it doesn't sound like a good fit and that I'm looking for xyz instead. They may have something now or in the future that I'm interested in. I don't tailor my resume and I sometimes make exceptions to one or more of the above if there's a job that really interests me.\n\n\nWhen I'm asked about salary expectations I always ask what the approved range for the role is. Most of the time they will tell you and you can tell them if that works for you or not.\n\n\nIf I'm interviewing for multiple companies at once I typically don't mention it.

From what I can tell, it always tend to list 100+ applicants as some sort of bare minimum.  I don't pay attention to it at all.  The only thing I care about is \"freshness\" (older than a month, posted this week) and job match.  I don't consider LinkedIn to be too bad since 1) that's where I got my last job that I was laid off from and worked the past 4 years and 2) while I'm getting fast rejections I AM getting responses (and thus, likely legitimate job postings).\n\nIf you only found out a few days ago, then I'm not sure why you'd get discouraged right off the bat.  I've always found jobs around 1 month after I started job hunting in the past, but I consider those good times when the job market was stronger.  I wouldn't find it beyond the ordinary for a job search in today's market to take 3+ months.\n\nSince I did get the opportunity to play a DevOps Engineer on TV, I've integrated AI into various parts of my workflow (using Firecrawl MCP to scrape ATS and job boards, using chrome-devtools MCP to scrape LinkedIn/Indeed/Glassdoor/Builtin, tailoring resumes with python-docx).  Most of my effort is spent filtering out bad matches, and I'm averaging 7+ job applications per week.\n\nIf I'm not applying for jobs or tuning my AI-workflow, then I'm spending my time learning Golang.  If I get done with that, then I'll brush up on Bash/Python.  If I'm done with that, maybe I'll take the CKA.\n\nMy time is either spent:\n\n1. Searching for and applying to jobs.\n\n2.

A lot of us learned by struggling through docs, half-broken tutorials, and hours of debugging tiny mistakes. When you’ve put in that kind of effort, watching someone get unstuck with a prompt can feel like the whole grind didn’t matter. That reaction makes sense, especially if learning to code was tied to proving you could survive the pain. \n\nBut I don’t think AI ruined coding, it just shifted what matters. Writing syntax was never the real skill, thinking clearly was. AI is useful when you already have some idea of what you’re doing, like debugging faster, understanding unfamiliar code, or prototyping to see if an idea is even worth building. Tools like Cosine for codebase context, Claude for reasoning through logic, and ChatGPT for everyday debugging don’t replace fundamentals, they expose whether you actually have them. Curious how people here are using AI in practice rather than arguing about it in theory.",

Where in many cases they lean too heavily on ai to code things for them to the point where they’re not actively learning/coding as much as they perhaps should in order to advance their career and grow in the profession. \n\n\nNow as far as jobs go in mid to senior levels, I think ai has increased efficiency and in a way helped businesses somewhat eliminate positions for jr/level 1 engineers as level 2s, 3s etc can make great use of ai to quickly scaffold out or outright fix minor issues that perhaps otherwise they’d give to a jr dev - atleast this is what I’ve seen locally with some companies around me.

You wrote something, it failed, you stared at it, and eventually the failure taught you something. AI short-circuits that loop by offering an answer before the struggle finishes. But that does not mean learning disappears. It means feedback moves earlier and becomes optional rather than forced. At [codeant.ai](http://codeant.ai), we see teams struggle when AI gives answers without explaining impact or reasoning. That is when learning degrades. When AI explains why a change is risky, how a bug propagates, or what assumption was violated, learning accelerates. The problem is not AI assistance. The problem is unexamined assistance. Just like copy-pasting from Stack Overflow never taught anyone unless they interrogated the solution, AI only helps when the developer remains engaged in evaluation. The real shift is that learning now requires intentional curiosity rather than enforced frustration. That is uncomfortable for people who equated pain with progress. But pain was never the teacher. Feedback was. AI simply gives you the option to bypass feedback or to deepen it. The outcome depends entirely on how it is used.",

In earlier eras, skill was demonstrated by endurance, how long you could grind through poor tooling, missing docs, or cryptic errors. That pain acted as a filter. What AI compresses is not thinking, but the time it takes to reach a decision point. In our experience building CodeAnt AI, we see this clearly when AI reviews code. Developers who understand tradeoffs immediately use AI to accelerate reasoning, validate assumptions, and explore alternatives. Developers without fundamentals get outputs they cannot judge or safely apply. The skill did not disappear, it became visible faster. This mirrors what happened when IDEs replaced raw editors or when debuggers replaced printf statements. The ability to reason about correctness, risk, and system behavior still determines outcomes. AI just removes the illusion that typing speed or memorized syntax was the differentiator. If anything, the bar is higher now because shallow understanding is exposed earlier. You cannot hide behind effort alone when a tool can generate plausible code instantly. What matters is whether you can recognize when that code is wrong, incomplete, or dangerous. That is not less skill. It is more honest skill.",

You already tried running tests in parallel, which is the logical first step.   \n  \nThe second step is to detect flaky tests, and flag them accordingly, so you can skip them and fix them.\n\nA next step could be to map the coverage of your tests to your codebase, and only run the tests that are relevant to changes in your code.  \n  \nAnd finally, but this is more an advanced scenario, there are options to learn from historical test-runs and use this data with machine-learning systems to define what tests to run in what order, because you know from this historical test-run data, with a configurable Pxx signifance, that if test X fails, the other tests will also fail, and you can basically \"fail fast\" and skip all the \"downstream\" tests and fail the pipeline.   \n  \nDisclaimer: I work for CircleCI, one of the original global cloud-native CI/CD and DevOps platforms (we started just a few months after the first Jenkins release in 2011).

The good news is - with AI around, there is no more good reason to not have more unit tests. You have to tell the devs that they need to restructure the tests. If not, you will ask AI to mute their long running, flaky tests.\n\nRealistically, find out which are the slow tests are just ask the team to stop running them as part of the build. Also, they can consider running long, flaky test as a daily build on the most recent main code branch. This should not run part of the build process.\n\nHappy to share more info if you need it.",

I know that means I need solid Docker and Kubernetes knowledge, so I’ve started learning and practicing them in my limited free time. I’ve even built some small projects already.\n\nThe problem is that my current salary is around standard market level, which is great, but when I apply for DevOps roles, I usually run into two outcomes:\n\n1, I don’t even get invited to an interview,\n\n2, I get an interview, but they offer me about half my current salary because they would hire me as a junior DevOps engineer due to my lack of hands-on experience with Docker and Kubernetes.\n\nRight now I simply can’t afford to cut my salary in half. On top of that, my current company doesn’t really use Docker or Kubernetes, so I don’t have the chance to gain real work experience with them.\n\nI know the market is shit for switching jobs right now, but living in a country where salaries are already much lower than in most of Europe makes this even more frustrating.

Learn how Devops aims to improve software delivery. Leverage your experience of managing multiple cloud tenancies with guardrails etc into managing multiple teams or programs of devs in Github or Gitlab etc. Or for cutting edge, learn how to support dev teams into agentic AI development, and what kinds of guardrails you can put in place for companies. Learn how to bake security into software development rather than tacking it on later.\n\nYeah, that learning that stuff is going to be hard without some exposure to developers, software development and being able to speak their language.

The team lead of our DevOps department wanted me over there because of my IaC and Kubernetes experience, but my manager blocked the move so I decided to look out and see what are my options.\n\nNext month I'm starting in another company as a Cloud Engineer again but with a 50% pay rise to what I'm currently getting. So my suggestion would be to not fixate so hard on the title, but the pay of it.\n\nYou already have strong experience and nice certifications. Get CKA and CKS maybe and you'll learn what you need about Kubernetes. Knock out Terraform Associate, it's pretty easy cert and with your experience you should get it in no time. \n\n  \nWhat I'm saying is look what's out there, As others have said you are already doing 80% of what a DevOps is and that's just a title with different responsibilites and meaning in each company. Look out for yourself and get a nice pay rise, ignore the title :)",

After a lot of hours I've managed to create a directory of 1028 opensource software.\n\nI've seen multiple other sites which have the same premise and all the GitHub Awesome Lists, but they lack in identifying if the repo is active, abandoned or just the general consensus of the OSS they have listed, the upvote system on this directory should really help show which OSS excel. I'm also working a deeper categorization system which shows alerts and highlights about the repos status , eg. whether the project is experimental, buggy/unstable, has a restrictive license or corporate influence.\n\nI've added a submission system so you opensource developers out there can list your projects.",

Things like:\n\n* TLS certificates\n* API keys and credentials\n* Licenses and subscriptions\n* Domains\n* Contracts or compliance documents\n\nIn theory this stuff is simple. In practice, I’ve seen outages, broken pipelines, access loss, and last minute fire drills because something expired and nobody noticed in time.\n\nI’ve worked in a few DevOps and SRE teams now, and I keep seeing the same patterns:\n\n* spreadsheets that slowly rot\n* shared calendars nobody owns\n* reminder emails that get ignored\n* “Oh yeah, X was supposed to renew that”\n* \"There is too much tools for that and people don't communicate properly on the new time-bound assets or the new places where they are used\"\n\nSo I wanted to ask the community:\n\n**How are you handling this today?**\n\nSome specific questions I’m really interested in:\n\n* Where do you store expiration info? Code, CMDB, wiki, spreadsheet, somewhere else?\n* Do you track ownership or is it mostly implicit?\n* How far in advance do you alert, if at all?\n* Are expirations tied into incident response or ticketing?\n* What’s broken for you today that you’ve just learned to live with?\n\nI’m especially curious how this scales once you’re dealing with:\n\n* multiple teams\n* multiple cloud providers\n* audits and compliance requirements\n* people rotating in and out\n\nIf you’ve had a failure caused by an expiration, I’d love to hear what happened and what you changed afterward, if anything.\n\nContext: I’m a DevOps engineer myself. After getting burned by this problem a few too many times, I ended up building a small tool focused purely on expiration lifecycle management. I won’t pitch it here unless people ask. The goal of this post is genuinely to learn how others are solving this today.\n\nLooking forward to the war stories and lessons learned.",

Each vendor has its own model, its own UI, its own APIs (or lack of them), and its own ideas of what “best practice” means. At scale, that turns into constant rework: SAML certs, CI/CD tokens, API keys, any kind of digital assets, all expiring on different clocks and breaking different parts of the stack.\n\nAutomation helps a lot, but only per vendor and per integration. You still end up needing a global view that answers “what is expiring soon, where is it used, and who needs to act”, otherwise you just move the fire drills around instead of eliminating them.\n\nu/badaccount99  Funny thing is, that “let’s form a company” line is basically how this whole discussion started for me. I hit that exact wall internally and ended up building [TokenTimer.ch](http://TokenTimer.ch) to at least handle the visibility and ownership side. It doesn’t magically automate every renewal, but it *does* help answer “what’s expiring, where, and who needs to deal with it” before everything breaks at once.",

It's not about me not automating my routine tasks, I've done that. It is about problems that come up. Upgrades and refactoring are super quick with AI. 0 day cve's could be addressed much more quickly with AI. Really, the question is what are you doing you think an AI couldn't do in 5 years. I can't think of much honestly. The only thing that limits ai is it's trained on us/the Internet so it's a good summary of all available knowledge. New novel ideas we can provide will make them better and it'll be interesting what AI will be able to do with new discoveries as well. We'll either have a better future where we can work on more human things or this will be used to enrich a few people and leave most of us with less. Time will tell. Anyways that's my take on it.",

          "text": "One of the big reasons for no specifics is that leadership doesn't know how you do what you do. They know that a lot of the AI tools that are out there are claiming to save money or make it easier to have a single person do more in the same amount of time by being more abstract across the process.\n\nIt's actually a good thing they are letting you analyze and figure out what tools and which processes could be optimized with more automation.\n\n  \nThat said, a lot of the important work that senior specialists do cannot be replaced with AI. Most of the AI tools out there are doing their best \"Google and Copy-paste from Stack Overflow\" impersonation, but I don't pretend I'm not doing the same thing. I'm not a specialist in writing infrastructure automation code, but I can use the LLMs to do the nitty gritty of generating the right syntax and then use my expertise to oversee, test, refine, secure, and make sure it's doing what I want it to do.\n\nFor my role I'm specifically using AI in these scenarios:  \n1. Error log analysis: Combing through logs is a pain, so I dump that stuff in an LLM and tell it to give me some things it thinks I should look into, along with likelihood of those paths having a successful resolve.  \n  \n2. Data analysis: I'm done pretending I know how to do Excel. I've been doing it 20+ years and still find it a pain everytime I'm trying to chart and analyze data. So I'm letting the machine figure out the best way to pull the data together in a way I want and present it for somebody else to consume in a report.  \n  \n3. Performance reviews: They want me to be more efficient, so I'm cutting down where I deliver least value. When I'm being asked to report on my accomplishments and what I did on a performance evaluation, I send the AI off into my status report updates to my manager to comb through all those emails and pull it out and put together something that seems reasonable (obviously reviewed and edited for hallucinations).  \n  \n4. Asking AI about why it sucks: In Visual Studio Code, depending on the model, I get varying results of whether it pays attention to MCP tools or Copilot instructions so I often interrogate it to learn better how to give those models what they need to do a better job. This allows me to share something with others so everybody on the team can work with the tools better.\n\n5. Research: I have access to a license for Office 365 Copilot so I use it's Research agent to go digging through the internet when I need to find a general recommendation for tool options, product comparisons, etc. By pulling together all the sources for me it's easier for me to get started on digging in.\n\n6. Code gen: The code generation is really good for established frameworks and languages. I find that most of the models tend towards older versions of the frameworks, so I need Cursor rules/Claude Skills/Copilot instructions to really give it the context about what tech to reference and where those docs are. \n\n7. Basic testing: AI can generate some useful tests to get you a bit of coverage so that you can spend time on the more complicated testing pieces. But I wouldn't trust auto-generated Jest unit tests to 100% validate an app. The models often forget to add new tests when you make app changes, or forget to update existing tests. Sometimes they will straight up remove tests that are failing because that will make it go green.",

I have it do the analysis using python tools, and dump the results to excel for the non-nerds. I haven't had to stumble my way through Excel in about a year.  \n\n> Performance reviews: They want me to be more efficient, so I'm cutting down where I deliver least value. When I'm being asked to report on my accomplishments and what I did on a performance evaluation, I send the AI off into my status report updates to my manager to comb through all those emails and pull it out and put together something that seems reasonable (obviously reviewed and edited for hallucinations).\n\nI used it to scan my Jira tickets and generate my review for me. I fed it the criteria of the review and had it build the results using Jira stories and my notes. After 5 minutes of editing it was the best looking review I have done since I started over 4 years ago. \n\n> Asking AI about why it sucks: In Visual Studio Code, depending on the model, I get varying results of whether it pays attention to MCP tools or Copilot instructions so I often interrogate it to learn better how to give those models what they need to do a better job. This allows me to share something with others so everybody on the team can work with the tools better.\n\nI call this AI introspection. When me and the AI agree on something that it keeps forgetting, I tell the agent to add it to the instructions file so it doesn't forget. It works most of the time. When it doesn't work, I don't have to explain a lot to get it back on track. I just tell it to review the instructions before proceeding. \n\n> Code gen: The code generation is really good for established frameworks and languages. I find that most of the models tend towards older versions of the frameworks, so I need Cursor rules/Claude Skills/Copilot instructions to really give it the context about what tech to reference and where those docs are.\n\nI have found that adding documentation to the context helps a lot in getting results from newer frameworks. Context7 MCP server has a lot of this documentation already set up in a format that is AI friendly. \n\n> Basic testing: AI can generate some useful tests to get you a bit of coverage so that you can spend time on the more complicated testing pieces.

Sometimes they will straight up remove tests that are failing because that will make it go green.\n\nTesting is where we have been bad on our own. Adding instructions to add tests when we modify things really has improved our testing.  Before a PR a prompt to update testing generally gets it rolling on adding new tests and updating existing tests. Even when it isn't quite right, it almost always finds the right places, so we can verify and fix without digging through mounds of code.",

If you really want to make a strong resume learn the following: Linux, terraform, kubernetes, troubleshooting and any cloud provider service architectures. Get CKAD, terraform associate certifications (believe me they're not easy). And then you can go for automation projects in python/go/any scripting language for that matter. You can build small automation that spins up a kubernetes cluster, spins up certain number of pods, imports defined container image into the pods and start running it as an application. If you want to go for advanced project, you can define scaling and pod-to-pod connectivity. Just this...and that will be enough. Half of the devops engineer in this world don't know everything. I myself learnt kubernetes once I started working as devops engineer.",

A CS degree probably gave you solid fundamentals architecture, networking, OS concepts, etc. Also, plenty of DevOps engineers don’t work in the cloud at all.\n\nYou already have Linux and Bash, which is a strong base. Cloud is mostly just another abstraction layer: permissions become IAM, VMs become Compute Engine/EC2, and so on.\n\nBefore you jump into certifications, I’d honestly build a small homelab. Install Proxmox, then set up a few things, for example:\n\n\t•\ta NAS VM for storage\n\n\t•\tVMs for a Docker host, LDAP, Pi-hole\n\n\t•\ton the Docker host: Jellyfin/Plex, whatever you actually use\n\nOnce you’ve done it manually, you’ll naturally want to automate it. Start with templates, then move to Ansible + Git. Later you can replace more and more with Terraform (or at least use IaC principles), and you’ll learn the concepts way deeper.\n\nWhy? Because you’ll hit the same problems as in the cloud, just on a smaller scale:\n\n\t•\thow to manage access across machines\n\t•\thow to provision machines faster\n\t•\thow to optimize resources\n\t•\thow to standardize setups\n\nAnd yeah, you’ll probably end up writing some custom Python scripts once you start seeing opportunities.\n\nAI will replace “clickers.” I’ve met people who’ve been in cloud roles for years and still can’t do the basics underneath. And some companies will test that (e.g., “set up LDAP” or similar tasks), even if the job is cloud-heavy.\n\nInternal transfer is honestly one of the best paths so go for it like you said.

Manual testers often have a solid grounding in quality thinking, which aligns really well with DevOps because you’re already focused on finding issues early and improving reliability that’s a mindset, not just a job title.\n\nA few practical ways people make this transition smoothly:\n\n1) Leverage what you already know  \nYour Python, Linux, and shell scripting skills are real assets, they’re exactly the kind of automation foundation DevOps looks for. Many testers begin by automating test suites in CI/CD pipelines and that naturally evolves into owning delivery pipelines.\n\n2) Start with automation + CI/CD projects  \nSet up a small project (even on your own) that:\n\n* Builds via GitHub Actions/CI on every commit\n* Runs automated tests\n* Deploys to a staging environment That gives you practical pipeline experience interviewers love to see.\n\n3) Learn cloud and IaC incrementally  \nYou don’t need to know everything at once, focus on one cloud (AWS, Azure, or GCP depending on your company) and get comfortable with basic services + how to automate their provisioning (Terraform or managed stacks).\n\n4) Use your testing background as leverage  \nInstead of starting from scratch, frame your QA experience as quality assurance in delivery , DevOps values people who understand how to prevent regressions and improve pipeline confidence.\n\nOne pattern I see in successful transitions is turning every manual step you currently do into an automated, observable step ,that’s literally what modern DevOps delivery systems are built on. Once you have even a couple of proofs of work (GitHub repo, pipeline examples), internal transfers and interviews become much more straightforward.",

      "text": "I worked as a frontend developer until last June. A friend told me about a devops opening in his Fortune 500 department. I wasn't interested at first because I preferred coding over managing Docker or K8s, but the salary hike and the big company experience were too good to pass up. He also persuaded me that they were using relatively new technologies and doing devops do no harm to my career. I almost missed the deadline, but the manager reopened the application just for me, which put a lot of pressure on me not to embarrass my friend during the hiring process.\n\nI heard from my friends that the current tech stack includes Sitecore, Azure, Cloudflare, Kubernetes, Docker, and SQL. They also used Terraform extensively. Since I had zero professional devops experience, I had to cram knowledge in two weeks. I would say for people like me AI would help a lot. I use Claude and Beyz coding assistant to help me understand complex concepts. Even with all that, I still had no confident in the interview. However, the actual interview was unexpected. The manager didn't do any code test and ask technical questions. He focused entirely on personality check, which is a little weird but after working with him for months I think it’s quite his personality. I think interview patterns totally depend on interviewers’ preference because the manager of another group require two code tests. When he asked what I value most, I told him about my learning trajectory: I went from a Chemistry degree to a Master’s in Power Electronics, then a second Master’s in Power Systems, and finally became a coder. I explained that switching fields and picking up new stacks is my core strength. I told him that I’m a quick study, but I’m definitely not into socializing. He gave a slow nod and just said \"Good\". After the interview, I just went back to my daily work. I didn't really expect much since I was honest about having zero experience. But I got the offer two days latter.\n\nNow that I’ve been on the job for about 6 months. I spent the early months learning while working, now I'm a little more comfortable. Unlike Frontend, where work ends when you close your IDE, DevOps is tied to release windows. Most of our releases happen after 7 PM. I do K8s cluster upgrades at midnight, which is a massive shift in work-life balance. For those who transitioned from Frontend to DevOps, I'd love to hear your reasons for making the jump and how you're feeling about the change now. ",

The Leader is the Emperor: As long as the leader is active and sending heartbeats, the \"era\" continues.\n2. Term Increments = New Eras: When a leader fails, a new election starts and the term number increases- just like transitioning from the Heisei era to Reiwa.\n3.

I really like the operational model (simple, binary, easy to reason about), but the licensing basically killed it for a lot of open-source use cases.\n\nI expected a fork to show up pretty quickly. It never really did, so I ended up forking the last Apache version (v1.6.5) myself and started dragging it into 2025.\n\nWhat’s done so far:\n\n*  Updated the toolchain (Go 1.21 → 1.24)\n* Cleaned up accumulated CVEs (govulncheck comes back clean)\n* Added a small CLI shim so existing automation doesn’t immediately break\n\nThis is not meant to compete with Kubernetes. It’s for cases where you want a scheduler you can actually understand end-to-end without needing a platform team. \n\nIf you rely on Nomad Enterprise features, this won’t help you. This will lag upstream Nomad features by design.\n\nGovernance-wise, it’s just me right now. The plan is to prove it’s viable and then hand it off to a neutral foundation (CNCF, Linux Foundation, etc.) so it doesn’t become another abandoned fork.\n\n[Docs](https://openwonton.org)\n\n[Repo](https://github.com/openwonton/openwonton)\n\nFeedback very welcome—especially from anyone who abandoned Nomad but misses the model.",
