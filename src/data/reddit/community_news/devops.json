Our scale is not that big, but the usage patterns (very fast ramp-up in traffic spikes and a nation-wide streaming service) are similar and we have encountered the same problems.  \n  \nWe minimized the use of NAT-gateways by leveraging transit gateways and avoided the ip-exhaustion by using IPv6. DNS performance has been a problem for us, but we finally fixed it for good by implementing node-local DNS-cache, getting rid of all alpine-images and setting ndots to 3.  \n  \nThe scaling up is still difficult to do fast enough, but by minimizing the size of container images, using fast pull-through caches for them, overprovisioning clusters so there's always free capacity and scaling replicas based on request count instead of CPU, we have managed to make it just fast enough to work 90% of time. We still need to manually scale up the minimum replicas before large events, though.",

Those chunks were published via CDNs to limit our own bandwidth needs. The “list of chunks” was kept current through the CDN with a short TTL.\n\nThe only thing a user had to be connected to us directly for was the DRM. But a single request to that system was good enough for 30 minute chunks, so scaling it was super easy.\n\nWhile there is inherently some delay in this architecture, it was only 30-60s (when I worked there 10 years ago; Maybe less now).",

LLM/Diffusion mlOps (diffusion is sightly different but I’ll lump them together), and then more traditional ML (prediction, analytics and others). \n\nThey both have a large overlap in data engineering, but in my personal opinion the latter has more data engineering needs. Really the only difference to a traditional platform engineering is that you have a lot more ETL around training and retraining, and your CI/CD platforms have to be able to handle gpu and multi gpu optimizations and deployment. I work on systems that abstract cuda and hardware choices away from developers (I want the best hardware to be picked for them when they train their models so they don’t have to worry about things like chipset architecture on supporting loss of precision of floating points for example). \n\nSo you have to have moderate coding/compliers/gpu knowledge. Enough that you could train a model yourself if you wanted to. Simply so you can build the systems that support them. \n\nIt’s still just massive k8 and build tooling work and now slap on metrics cycle on gpu tasks more than cpu, and how many people may use your model outputs (in the case of classic ML) or your model itself (LLM//diffusion) which is more like large scale api design.",

Some resources were clearly created for testing years ago and left running, and figuring out whether they were safe to delete was painful. To make things worse, developers have admin access to the management account. I know this is bad, and I plan to raise it with leadership.\n\nMy immediate challenge isn’t fixing the org structure overnight, but the fact that we don’t have any process to track:\n\n* who owns a resource\n* why it exists\n* how long it should live (especially non-prod)\n\nThis leads to wasted spend, confusion during incidents, and risky cleanup decisions. SCPs aren’t an option since this is the management account, and pushing everything into member accounts right now feels unrealistic.\n\nFor folks who’ve inherited setups like this:\n\n* What practical process did you put in place first?\n* How did you enforce ownership and expiry without SCPs?\n* What minimum requirements should DevOps insist on?\n* Did you stabilise first, or push early for account separation?\n\nLooking for battle-tested advice, not ideal-world answers 🙂\n\n\n\nEdit: Thank you so much everyone who took time and shared their thoughts. I appreciate each and everyone of them! I have a plan ready to be presented with the management. Let's see how it goes, I'll let you all know how it went, wish me luck :)",

I’m at the tail end of one of these (created the new root org 3.5 years ago) and so far have discovered that \n\n* I won’t be able to migrate rds from the legacy account to the new app-production account while migrating to aurora. \n* Migrating dynamo is also possible but annoying— you have to create IAM permission grants and the application has to assume a role in the old or new account depending on whether the application is migrated before or after dynamo (or if dynamo is ending up in a different account than the application), and it’s likely that these applications have never had to assume a role before and are running some ancient version of boto and no one will ever have time to prioritize fixing it. \n* Migrating secretsmanager objects is very touchy and not trivial to script\n* MWAA does not actually want to work in the recommended best practice account structure (with the VPC shared over RAM from the infrastructure account to the app account) and needs an elaborate event bridge/lambda infrastructure to create vpc endpoints in the infra account\n\nI’m sure that if we were using other services we would have made other discoveries, and I’m sure that if we were using worse IAC (we did 95% of this with crossplane, and only used terraform for the VPC core resources and EKS clusters) like, for example, if we had kept 1 line of the awful horrendous CDK stuff that one of my predecessors tried to deploy, we would have learned other things.\n\nThis is an expensive migration. At the end of it, you will still just have the same capability as before. It will be drastically easier to explain things to auditors, it will be easier to grow in a sane way, your AWS spend will probably be higher at the end but with less waste, it will be safer and better in a dozen other ways that are difficult to quantify, but if your org is not otherwise growing/maturing it will be extremely difficult to explain to management why anyone should be working on this instead of deploying new features. And frankly, unless your org needs to transform for other reasons (growing rapidly, suddenly has more audit compliance needs), it is probably correct that feature development should take priority.",

You'll face uphill struggles getting people to adopt your desired behaviour. \nSo you need very strong Exec backing & authority. Your biggest piece of work is creating the case for change (benefits: cost, security risk, change management risk, etc). Once you have exec sponsorship,  you need colleague buy-in, otherwise when you disrupt the norms, they complain to their Execs, and You get framed as a barrier to success,  rather than an enabler. \n\nOn the technical side make sure you've understood the product & working practices before changing the deployed estate: remove remote access to an rds instance? What about Bob who runs a cleanup routine every Friday from ssms, so solution doesnt crash over wknd?\n\nDevops, shift left only stick when it's cultural change.\n\nAlso, track & demonstrate the value of your changes, eg keep an 'avoided costs' register (shutting down dev overnight & weekends avoided $1.5k/month). And use something like CSPM to get independent security scores (hey, boss, we scores 20% on AWS' security best practices, is that ok?).\n\nGood luck! it's been a long road here, and every 2 steps forward are challenged, but we are now mindful of value & security, along with lifecycle. Even if we still have a ton of tech debt, we're making things better faster than were making them worse.",

Devs will never give back admin and migrating all the hand jammed stuff will be an unholy nightmare that will take years. I hate to be so negative, but I’ve tried to do this before and it was an absolutely terrible experience. I quit being in tech leadership because of doing this. In my case it was an aging data center and AWS accounts like this. Never build KPIs around migration goals. The work will always get pushed back in favor of new features, and if everyone is not totally on board, it will become an infinite process.  If you decide to go through with it, start with tagging all your terraform and using something like cortex.io to rein in the application sprawl.",

The false positive reduction is huge - 18% to 3% probably saved more dev time than the speed improvement.\n\nOne thing that catches my attention is the auto-retry logic. We do something similar but had to get careful about what constitutes a \"single failure\" vs actual breakage. Race conditions and timing issues will retry fine, but real regressions can sometimes pass on second attempt if they're edge cases.\n\nWe ended up flagging any test that needed a retry and reviewing those weekly. Found patterns where certain tests were inherently flaky due to bad test design, not infrastructure issues. Worth tracking that data if you aren't already.\n\nThe critical vs full suite split is honestly the move for teams deploying that frequently. We went even further and have different tiers - smoke tests (2 min), critical (8 min), extended (25 min), full (90 min overnight). Lets you tune confidence vs speed based on what you're shipping.\n\nOnly other thing I'd add is make sure your nightly full suite failures actually get attention. Easy for teams to ignore them once the fast feedback loop is working, but that's where you catch the weird integration bugs that slip through.\n\n14 minutes is solid for a comprehensive pipeline. Most places I've seen either sacrifice coverage for speed or end up with hour-long builds nobody trusts.",

It allows quickly identifying bottlenecks and issues in requests served with microservice architecture. But the tracing doesn't work in practice on highly loaded systems most of the time, because it generates a ton of data (trace spans), which requires a lot of costs for processing, storing and querying. These costs are usually higher than the costs for the monitored microservices. There are workarounds with various types of sampling for the collected traces (i.e. only a small part of traces are stored and are available for querying and analysts). But the sampling can drop traces for requests you may need to investigate in the future.",

For Azure it's simply FUBAR on many fronts, e.g. implement AMPLS to get health checks to private infrastructure and suddenly your VM agent installations are broken because they happen to use the same domain for downloads or configuration as your observability ingestion. Similar architecture design and implementation issues, mostly because of really bad documentation. Getting your logs archived is a whole month-long project because they have shoehorned you to put everything into a log workspace and use the exporting rules, and those blobs do not even support archiving. Duplicating at the source gets you different formats as now you have three implementations (log export rule, data collection rule and platform logs). It's a fucking mess.\n\nPaid monitoring platforms like Datadog etc. keep shining, but have scummy business practices and know what they have, so you are paying a $$$$$ premium for something that platform-native monitoring solutions could do almost for free while not trying to get fucked over by them which they actively try to do to squeeze money out of you.\n\nPagerDuty I have worked with recently and it's just a complete freaking mess. Undocumented everything, magic everywhere, nothing useful on the important part like getting stuff into the platform in a robust and sane way etc. Even then alert management leave a lot to be desired.\n\n---\n\nAll in all, I believe the only viable, scalable and especially operatable implementation is the classic OSS Grafana+Prometheus+Loki stack with some development and design time under it.",

The problem is when something breaks, you’re staring at data without knowing which change actually mattered. That’s where things get messy. The teams handling this better are closing the gap between code changes and runtime signals. They track not just what failed, but what behavior was introduced. That context comes from understanding PR-level intent, dependencies, and flow changes, not from dashboards. We’ve seen this internally while building CodeAnt AI: when reviewers understand impact upfront (what paths change, which services are touched, what assumptions shift), production observability becomes confirmation, not discovery.\n\nSo in 2026, observability isn’t cleaner tools, it’s fewer unknowns.

Not replacing the job just handling the repetitive parts nobody wanted anyway.  \n  \nStill plenty of work probably more interesting work actually more building reliable systems.

Being senior is more about system design and incident response - the stuff that still needs human judgment.\n\nI think it's permanent for companies that invest in it. The ROI on good automation is so obvious now that even conservative orgs are buying in. But there's definitely a divide between places that modernized their ops and places still running everything through jira tickets and manual deployments.\n\nThe work is way more interesting when you're not constantly context-switching to fix access issues that should've been solved years ago.",

          "text": "It absolutely feels like DevOps is evolving faster recently , not just in tools, but in why we do it. Looking back, GitOps, self-service provisioning, and stronger identity models didn’t happen overnight , but they’ve quietly reshaped delivery workflows and access patterns.\n\nA lot of the noise you see in comments , about burnout, tool sprawl, and exhaustion comes from complexity stacking instead of solving core problems. That’s exactly where platform engineering comes in: simplifying developer experience and delivery systems so teams get predictable outcomes instead of juggling the next shiny tool. Discussions about shifting to platform teams highlight that evolution too ,it’s not just rebranding, it’s responding to scale challenges DevOps alone didn’t fully answer.\n\nTrends also show DevOps isn’t disappearing , it’s integrating with AI/automation, dev experience, security practices, and platform thinking. Engineers who thrive aren’t those who chase every new tool, but those who understand systems and delivery models and can make them reliable, observable, and easy to use.",

Has anyone else had experience with something like this? If I don’t get the job should I try and pitch it to my boss?\n\nEDIT 1: To the snarky comments saying “how are you surprised by this?” “This is just terraform”. No no no… the tool sits above your IaC (terraform/helm/opentofu) ingests it as is through your git repos and converts it into versioned blueprints. If you’re managing a mix of IaCs across multiple clouds, this literally orchestrates the whole thing. My team at my current job currently spends their whole time writing Terraform…\n\nEDIT 2: This also isn’t an IDP, when someone pushes a button on an IDP it doesn’t automatically deploy environments to the cloud. This lets developers create/update/destroy environments without even needing DevOps\n\nEDIT 3: Some people asking for the name of the tool, please PM me.",

Either you separate out your infra as code from your CI/CD, or you integrate the two and make both tasks harder than they need to be. \n\nAnother issue is cost - there is value in saving money with shared resources.  It could be RDS, Kubernetes, routing and networking.   I could give my devs completely isolated EKS clusters with completely isolated RDS, DocDB, Elasticache, s3 etc. backends on separate VPCs in separate accounts tomorrow.  But it would bankrupt my company by the end of the month.  So dev environments share components where they can, and there's all sorts of orchestration to manage those components. \n\nCan devs push a button to get a new environment?  sure.

It can also run code, for example using Pulumi.\n\nalternatively there likely is such commercial “software” somewhere, however all you are doing is swapping hcl and state files for db backend and vendor locking.",

Primarily because provisioning of environment is not making it development, test, or production ready by default. Most people struggle with data loads that is essential for functional testing.\n\nIn my career I was doing literally this at some point: build environment, prime databases (aka load data), deploy services, run automated functional tests (mostly via integration APIs), export test results, destroy environment so there’s no cloud billing. Full cycle in about 10 minutes.\n\nThat was pretty cool and turned most devs heads in the office. :)",

It can talk to the GCP database with no problem but cannot talk to assure. I made sure all the route tables look good, firewall rules and so on. Nothing I did would make it talk to the Azure DB. Days of troubleshooting later, I find out that traffic from a GKE pod is not routable over a single VPN connection between cloud providers. I will have to rebuild the VPN as an HA VPN with BGP and then it will be routable. I have no idea why a K8s pod isn’t routable over it. A VM running the app routes over it perfectly fine. It’s just GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) that has the limitation. I now have it working in QA.  \nThis was the most bullshitty networking troubleshooting I’ve ever had to do.

What is the **industry-standard way** to install Argo CD?\n   * Terraform Kubernetes provider?\n   * Ansible?\n   * Or just a simple `kubectl apply` / bash script?\n2.

In my case, I plan to:\n   * Install a **base Argo CD**\n   * Then use **Argo CD itself** to install and manage the **Argo CD Vault Plugin**\n\nBasically, I want to avoid tool overlap and follow what’s actually used in production today, not just what’s technically possible.\n\nWould appreciate hearing how others are doing this in real setups.\n\n\\---  \n**Disclaimer:**  \nUsed AI to help write and format this post for grammar and readability.",

That gets the Kubernetes cluster up. For the first time install of Argo CD we use a Helm chart, sometimes Terraform's Helm provider but often it is a manual apply because it only happens once at cluster bootstrapping. After that Argo CD manages everything else including itself via its own manifests in a GitOps repo. If we need to upgrade Argo CD or roll out a new version we update the Git repo and let Argo CD reconcile itself. Ansible did not really fit into the pipeline once we committed to everything living in the cluster. It is more for legacy VM config or when we need to do something directly on a node for weird edge cases. As for plugin installs we do the same thing, define it in Git and let Argo CD roll it out alongside everything else. In production I have seen that once Argo CD is there you do not want to mix too many config tools anymore. Makes life easier to keep that boundary clean.",

If not, ArgoCD is just going to add noise.  The nice thing about terraform is the ease in which you can destroy resources. I can use Ansible to provision my cloud resources pretty easily. But then have to write almost as many plays in reverse order to destroy those resources.  But if your team is good at Ansible, then it’s really a non-issue.  I can write a local provisioner in terraform but if my team doesn’t know HCL what’s the value? \n\nWe’ve had different professional services teams try and sell their best idea of provisioning and it all falls on deaf ears if it’s just one more thing the team needs to learn.  At the end of the day, provisioning clusters probably isn’t making the company any money.   Get them built as quick as possible the best way you know how and focus on whatever makes the company money.  Oh, and security…",

Now they have changed this strategy, but they moved to a slightly more fair pay for what you use strategy again mostly. Paying for ingest makes sense, however our new issues are with queries. We are now charged for these, a single dashboard for query to try and identify a root cause can go through such a large quantity of data and add up extremely quick. We have tried, but we were given zero ways to optimize these queries as we only ran into their platform limitations and they really just want us to pay. Again as an observability company, they seem to have zero interest in obseravability.  \n\\- Their UI brings even modern PCs to their kness, dashboards being the worst. We also struggled to get it to asign users tot he correct accounts if a user had multiple orgs assigned. So they constantly logged in and saw the wrong data, which was easy to change once they realised, but frustrating  \n\\- Their account managers for our region have all left and we were given an overseas team who simply did not care about our business, only signing the next years contract.\n\nThis is a competitive space, NR seems like they have a lot to offer, but they stopped major innovation a while back, many competitors are hungry for that market share now.",

I’ve been in the cloud space for about a year now, and overall I have around 5–6 years of IT experience.\n\nIn the cert side, i have AZ-900, AZ-104, AZ-305, and AZ-400\n\nIn my current role I worked my way up to a medior level, but my real goal is to move into DevOps. I know that means I need solid Docker and Kubernetes knowledge, so I’ve started learning and practicing them in my limited free time. I’ve even built some small projects already.\n\nThe problem is that my current salary is around standard market level, which is great, but when I apply for DevOps roles, I usually run into two outcomes:\n\n1, I don’t even get invited to an interview,\n\n2, I get an interview, but they offer me about half my current salary because they would hire me as a junior DevOps engineer due to my lack of hands-on experience with Docker and Kubernetes.\n\nRight now I simply can’t afford to cut my salary in half. On top of that, my current company doesn’t really use Docker or Kubernetes, so I don’t have the chance to gain real work experience with them.\n\nI know the market is shit for switching jobs right now, but living in a country where salaries are already much lower than in most of Europe makes this even more frustrating. Honestly, it’s hard to see a clear way forward.\n\nWhat would you do in my situation? How would you successfully pivot into DevOps without taking such a big financial step back? Any advice would be really appreciated.",

You should be able to say what you accomplished with the languages, tools, and technologies you've used \n\n2 - IT in an enterprise environment doesn't have a \"new tool every year\", but actually the technologies tend to stick around.

Get CKA and CKS maybe and you'll learn what you need about Kubernetes. Knock out Terraform Associate, it's pretty easy cert and with your experience you should get it in no time. \n\n  \nWhat I'm saying is look what's out there, As others have said you are already doing 80% of what a DevOps is and that's just a title with different responsibilites and meaning in each company.

For more, you'd have to hire me as a consultant (j/k). tl;dr you're on the right track.\n\n\\> High volume of repetitive requests (pipeline issues, access, environment questions)\n\nYou mentioned some expensive and complex processes with chatbots, etc. It sounds like you've combined your Devops with Helpdesk? I think that's a different kettle of fish, but for Devops, with sophisticated developer customers and truly repetitive, constrained tasks, consider automations! For example, a website or API your users can use.\n\n\\> Context switching for DevOps engineers\n\nInterrupts are expensive. A book like Time Management for System Administrators can help you with this, but a quick win are shifts when ops folks are on issue duty vs deep work duty.\n\n\\> Requests coming from multiple channels (chat, email, direct messages)\n\nEverything must come in via ticketing systems. No more requests by chat, email or DM. No exceptions. This is the only way to address the deluge, and the metrics. You'll need organizational buy in from the top here. You will get pushback at all levels.\n\nWhen I was a sys-admin roughly 20 years ago, one of my users thought coming up to my desk would help him bypass the process. I was on issue duty and when he came over to tell me his problem, I told him I was surprised\n\n\"I haven't seen this in the ticket system!\"\n\nhe said he hadn't put it in, so I opened up the ticket entry system and typed up the ticket for him, with a full description, etc.\n\nAfter I was done he exclaimed \"I could have done this myself!\" and I said, with as much friendly sincerity as I could muster, \n\n\"Huh. I guess you're right!\"\n\n  \n\\> 3. Request standardization\n\nThis is good in theory, but additional friction in entering tickets can create frustration by your users (who I hope you see as your customers).\n\n\\> DevOps focuses on:\n\nIt's so sad that this is what \"DevOps\" became. It was supposed to be shared responsibility. But that's where we are... Your split is right, but the original idea of DevOps was to break those barriers down, where developers felt responsible and ops could help find ways to help development.\n\n\\>  Observability & metrics\n\nWith so many people, you're going to need to have folks you trust telling you what they need, and if they can't do that kind of analysis, they either need to be trained to do so, or replaced.\n\nAt the same time, don't become obsessed with metrics either, or you may lose sight of the big picture.\n\n\\> Using this data to drive further automation\n\nThis is a bit off... Use the data to drive processes, not automation. Automation is just one possible process mechanism. It's not the only one, nor should it always be the answer.\n\nHope that helps!",

We operate mostly with shared pipelines, and historically when we fully delegated pipeline or infra power to development teams, change-management rules were quickly bypassed or treated as a formality.\n\nBecause of that, we intentionally keep certain controls centralized (e.g., prod pipelines, approvals, security gates).\n\nThe challenge we’re trying to solve now is how to balance developer autonomy with enforced governance.\n\nFrom your experience:\n\nHow did you enforce change-management discipline at scale without becoming a bottleneck?\n\nDid you rely more on process (policy, approvals, audits) or technical enforcement (pipeline gates, immutable workflows, separation of duties)?\n\nWere developers allowed to modify pipelines freely in non-prod, but restricted in prod?\n\nAny concrete patterns or lessons learned on keeping change management respected - not just documented - would be very valuable.",

                  "text": "I luckily never had to deal with a high regulation situation, but I think one possible benefit here is that you can use these regulation to your advantage.\n\nFor example, if you have a policy that says every change is captured as Infrastructure as Code and you enforce that through technical means (config management, automatic builds, no root logins etc.), then that de-facto addresses your change management flow problem since all changes IaC changes will be captured in code\n\nThen when changes do need to come in, you have a policy that says \"Every change has a ticket number associated with it\", just like you would for code, and you enforce that at both the technical and policy level.\n\nAll changes live in your git repo, and all changes have comment that says something like:\n\n\"Installed the Flizzblur application into development.\n\nCloses #575\"\n\nThat should be your foundation. It satisfies the very base of devops and it should work as help to your your change management requirements as well.\n\nWhen you have non-IaC changes, such as physical changes, you can use the same ticketing, etc. system. That makes it easy for you to track progress and keeps your communication consistent.\n\nThen you can look at your issue tracking system and figure out what tasks are the most problematic and address those issues with either a policy change or automation. You'll know what those are because they'll be common, or they'll have a lot of back and forth regarding clarification, or signed off requirements, or something similar.\n\nOnce you have a new automation for whatever it is, you can sell it to your users as a value-add rather than enforce it as a negative. Engineer replies to requests can say \"I've completed this request! Just so you know, if you have this request again, you don't need to wait for me, we have a new system to let do it yourself by going to https://...... \"",

              "text": "Yup, first thought. Get automation done in the background with the highest priority for common time consuming issues. For us this was LDAP / IAM CRUD, Docker and VM spin-ups, and DBs setup with parameter imported “large & clean” datasets (without actual customer data) for the particular development taking place. Some scripts, and a few internal GUIs and self service GUIs helped minimize time and misconfigurations (read another ticket). This made it easier for us, and kept devs in development and staging servers, it also helped us keep development and production servers and updates in sync.\n\nI will add a really decent ticket system instead of three routes of service requests, where you lose visibility on what your team is wasting their time on. Don’t make this onerous, it is for targeting ways to streamline stuff, don’t make filling out progress take as long as the fix. This also helps you identify things that don’t get fixed the first time, so you can zoom in in why.\n\nThe other big thing, if you do manual work, keep it standardized. Your guys may be smart, but even before you automate, having “scripts“ of how to do something keeps everyone on the same page, and minimizes architecture drift. In the long run you can work these workflows out so they are flawless before you automate. Why, one big reason because there were times where the fixes took more time than they needed to because one person had a way he set it up, and another had their way. Which is fine until one needs to troubleshoot the others work when they were not on call. All of this is a drag on resources.\n\nSome of the other things make middle management cream, but don’t actually benefit you on the floor getting your work done.",

Rather than address each one here is my additional take:\n\nHave someone *own* a roadmap to get these things done and go for high value items first. Here are the steps I would take:\n\n* Set a clear north/star big goal (reduce time spent on tickets by x, fully automate line 1 + line 2 support, automate self-service for 70%+ of developer requests: don't do all of them just take it as examples and tackle one)\n* Define a backlog of high level things that will get you there (enable ticketing system, create templates for the top 5 requests, etc)\n* Prioritize your backlog by impact (enabling ticket system may be high on your list, as well as templating), make sure to assign value to this so you can report on what you've achieved by completing stuff\n* Set fixed increments of a decent chunk of time, using company quarters are great for budgeting purposes\n   * Break your items down in to manageable tasks that can be done in a week or less\n   * Plan out any purchases and map out dependencies\n   * Get a PM if you need one, otherwise: account for someone to take care of this stuff - and if you do lengthen your timelines!\n   * DEDICATE TIME to this\n\nThe thing that I see teams do is, they pile all their 99 problems on a heap and then go: \"by x date this heap needs to be gone.\" And they never get there, most don't even start besides buying a whole bunch of tools that end up doing nothing or worse... and nowadays that's just a bunch of LLM based nonsense that you aren't mature enough to adopt.\n\n  \nSmall rant from someone who is old (in IT years):\n\nSpeaking of: in ye olden days organization maturity had clear metrics. That used to be something companies would go for: \"we are certified x in y, that's how efficient we are.\" That's been thrown out the window for some crazy reason, but it's not become any less true over the years. The entire point, imho of setting up a roadmap is not to \"build\" or \"implement\" tools... but adopt processes (and tools) over time and measure if it's valuable. If the thing you thought would be amazing (chat bot self service) turns out to be ass and no one uses it because no one manages a decent KB and/or the culture just has people pinging \"that IT person they know.\" Toss that shit out the window: go with something less complicated that will help. Let your DevOps team mature, let the organization around you mature as well. You MAY get stuck before you hit full self-service la-la-land and that is OK, just reduce some of the stress by organizing people's time and hiring more if that's what gets you there.",

Not perfect, but stopped the whole team being in reactive mode constantly.\n\nBiggest shift was mindset: DevOps as product team, not service desk.

They go straight for Kubernetes or Prometheus thinking those are good DevOps contributions, but you're competing with Google engineers who know the codebase better than you ever will.\n\nBetter approach: find smaller infrastructure tools that actually need help. I've had good luck with workflow orchestration projects, queue libraries, and monitoring agents. These maintainers are usually desperate for contributors and will actually review your PRs.\n\nStart with tools you're already using. If you're running GitHub Actions, look at the community actions that are poorly maintained. If you're using Docker, find the niche registry tools or build utilities. You'll understand the problem space and won't waste time learning a new domain.\n\nThe real value isn't the code contributions anyway - it's getting comfortable reading other people's infrastructure code and understanding how these tools break. I've learned more about distributed systems from debugging open source tools than I ever did from building greenfield stuff.\n\nConcrete next step: pick one tool you use daily that frustrates you, find its GitHub issues, and look for \"good first issue\" tags. Don't aim for core maintainer status, just get a few small PRs merged. The network effect comes naturally once you're actually contributing instead of trying to force it.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m preparing a production migration of an Elasticsearch cluster and I’m looking for real-world DevOps lessons, especially things that went wrong or caused unexpected operational pain.\n\n**Current situation**\n\n* Old cluster: single node, around 200 shards, running in production\n* Data volume: more than 100 million documents\n* New cluster: 3 nodes, freshly prepared\n* Requirements: no data loss and minimal risk to the existing production system\n\nThe old cluster is already under load, so I’m being very careful about anything that could overload it, such as heavy scrolls or aggressive reindex-from-remote jobs.\n\nI also expect this migration to take hours (possibly longer), which makes **monitoring and observability during the process critical**.\n\n**Current plan (high level)**\n\n* Use snapshot and restore as a baseline to minimize impact on the old cluster\n* Reindex inside the new cluster to fix the shard design\n* Handle delta data using timestamps or a short dual-write window\n\nBefore moving forward, I’d really like to learn from people who have handled similar migrations in production.\n\n**Questions**\n\n* What operational risks did you underestimate during long-running data migrations?\n* How did you monitor progress and cluster health during hours-long jobs?\n* Which signals mattered most to you (CPU, heap, GC, disk I/O, network, queue depth)?\n* What tooling did you rely on (Kibana, Prometheus, Grafana, custom scripts, alerts)?\n* Any alert thresholds or dashboards you wish you had set up in advance?\n* If you had to do it again, what would you change from an ops perspective?\n\nI’m especially interested in:\n\n* Monitoring blind spots that caused late surprises\n* Performance degradation during migration\n* Rollback strategies when things started to look risky\n\nThanks in advance. Hoping this helps others planning similar migrations avoid painful mistakes.",

Consider writing up the reasons why you think Pulumi could be a better choice for the project, make sure they are tied to business outcomes, and ideally set some expectations or measurements.\n\nSome common reasons our customers say they like using Pulumi:\n\n- Faster time to market with Pulumi (that is, they can get infra launched faster) b/c of the use of general purpose languages\n- Displeasure with how HashiCorp, an IBM Company canceled CDKTF with zero advance notice, pricing changes, etc.\n- Cross-language interoperability with Pulumi components (may not be applicable on a smaller-scale project)\n\nResume-driven development burns bridges and is short-sighted. This would also create a bad impression of Pulumi as a tool in your org, and I don't want that as a Pulumi employee.\n\nI would _not_ recommend using Ansible for infrastructure because there are much more capable tools out there, but Ansible is really nice if you need to do configuration management.\n\nYou can join our Community Slack if you need support while learning Pulumi: https://slack.pulumi.com",

The Terraform vs Pulumi debate often comes down to whether you prefer HCL's declarative constraints or the flexibility of real programming languages. Both have their place\n\nYour point about PaaS solutions for early-stage teams makes total sense. We're seeing this a lot at Render too, teams that want to ship features fast without becoming infrastructure experts first. You get managed databases, auto-scaling, and built-in security without writing any IaC at all. Then as you grow and your needs get more specific, you can always add infrastructure-as-code on top or migrate to something more complex.\n\nThe Kubernetes-native tools you mentioned (Crossplane, ACK, etc.) are interesting for teams already committed to K8s, but that's a pretty heavy lift if you're just trying to get an app in front of users\n\nWhat infrastructure approach are you all currently using, and what's been the biggest pain point?",

If you want to hire dedicated infra/devops/whatever they will for the most part not know Pulumi, but they will know OpenTofu/Terraform/Ansible. So hiring will be harder and you will get worse outcomes or at least a steeper learning curve for those people initially. A lot of infra stuff is also more geared towards tf stack, or at least gets it quicker, like AVMs for example.\n\nI just dont really see a huge benefit to Pulumi myself. Terraform markdown is not terribly complex, so devs to understand it should not be a huge issue for setups that are not super complex. And if you have very complex setup you'll probably have dedicated infra people anyway and you'll be back at my main point above.",
