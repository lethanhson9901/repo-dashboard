I collected all that plus other questions that I found on glassdoor, blind etc in a github repo. I've added my own video explanations to solve those questions. \n\nit's free and I hope this will help you to prepare and pass.

It’s incredibly frustrating because, in the real world, I would just check the `man` page or the docs in five seconds. I’ve architected scalable clusters and debugged complex race conditions at 3 AM, but apparently, none of that matters if I don't have the documentation memorized. It feels like we are being tested on our ability to be a dictionary rather than our ability to be engineers who solve problems.\n\nI wish more interviewers would actually test how I think. Ask me how I’d debug a 500 error on a Friday night or how I’d design a rollback strategy; don't ask me for a flag I’ve aliased in my `.bashrc` for three years.\n\nWhat is the most ridiculous \"trivia\" question you've ever been asked that had absolutely nothing to do with your actual ability to do the job?\n\nFor candidates who want to prepare beyond command-line trivia, this breakdown on real-world [DevOps interview questions](https://www.netcomlearning.com/blog/devops-interview-questions) highlights the skills employers should actually be evaluating.  \n",

Communicating that you understand the fundamental concepts and available tools which can do a job for you is more important than understanding that you can Google stuff and save what you found on stack overflow in an alias.\n\nAddressing OP's stated circumstance, an interviewer asking for specific flags is coming at it the wrong way. They should be asking about process and determining whether you have the core knowledge required instead of specifics and minutiae like flags. But some interviews are going to be shitty. When they are, pivoting directly to process is a better answer than just \"I use aliases\" and waiting for the interviewer to prompt you for more info.",

So they default to memorization.\n\nAlso, if that’s how they interview, that’s probably how they operate. Lots of gatekeeping, not a lot of engineering.\n\nOnly time CLI stuff makes sense is junior-ish and even then it should be fundamentals, not trivia. Like… explain stdin/stdout/stderr, pipes, exit codes, basic text processing, and how you’d find the answer when you don’t know. That’s way more realistic than “what’s the 3rd flag on tar I haven’t used since 2014.”\n\nRidiculous one I got once… “recite the exact rsync flags to do a dry run with delete and preserve perms” …as if `--help` doesn’t exist.",

How do you like them apples?” and gave me full FinOps responsibilities.\n\nNow this is a completely new world for me. I used to work on scaling behavior, instance types, cluster efficiency, etc. Now I’m expected to have an opinion on how much we should commit, how to model future usage, how to balance flexibility vs discounts, how to talk to finance...\n\nIt’s a different muscle entirely and doesn't feel like my forte.\n\nSo while I'm reflecting on the mistakes that led me here, I've got a couple of questions for anyone who made the jump from pure DevOps into FinOps territory: \n\nWhere did you start?\n\nAny hard lessons you can help me avoid?\n\nAny blog/podcast/book I should watch/read/listen to?",

You can turn that into roadmaps/project plans that management will eat up and buy yourself some time to show progress on building out foundational capabilities.  You'll figure out the forecasting and accounting stuff as you go.  Also try to find someone in your company's accounting department who you can work with to understand their view of the world; that stakeholder identification and coalition building is also in the framework.\n\nhttps://www.finops.org/framework/\n\nYou've stumbled into a good area; lots of people (and increasingly, AI; sorry haters) can do the cloud & devops technology stuff, but if you're the person who can talk to management about the what/where/why of the money they're spending on technology and how they're getting ROI (or not), you're quickly going to become their MVP.\n\nETA: Also look for FinOps podcasts; they're not going to be like structured training but they'll plant some seeds and give you ideas/examples/strategies for attacking things.\n\nE2TA: Also find resources on how to create effective visualizations (charts/graphs) for different types of data (costs/burn rates/forecasts).  A big part of this isn't just \"save money\" - it's effectively communicating how much is being spent on what and presenting the trade-offs for cost savings (cheaper VMs may slow developers down, but that could actually be the right business decision in some scenarios, even though the Devs might hate it).",

Datadog to manage and data for your system's APIs and you can provide a cost break-down for each and every API you process via process time x total month process time/total compute cost. provide storage and data cost etc.   \nLook into cost-reliablility ratios such as how important certain things need to be provided a larger instance that will more likely crash like flink connectors that get sudden large amounts of data. what happens if you provide a smaller buffer before autoscaling 60% vs 80%.   \nDiscounts depending on what you use but pretty straight forward cause azure and aws have the Reserved instance calculators you can just use. \n\nBiggest thing i did was just looking at the AWS Bill and going item by item and figuring why it needs to be what it is, and what is causing that cost. E.G. EFS was in the thousands from storing cache from a system that only needed 3 days of cache but was stored indefinitely.   \nSome higher level items could be the allocation of region specific services and the data transfer cost between the servers that could become a issue where you save alot if you break down your data store into region reducing latency and AZ and regional transfer cost.",

Hoping my experience might apply here, but it's mostly going to be SaaS focused.  \n\nCost optimizations is like any other optimization problem. Except it's a lot easier to measure, and if you make an impact, and also it's a lot easier for the business to appreciate it.   \n\nNot sure what your leadership expects, sounds like there wan't anyone looking at your cloud bill before. That's like running a service without monitoring, the moment you turn that on you'll find a lot of things to improve.   Hopefully you are not under pressure to reduce your bill significantly immediately.   \n\nYou have one benefit here that most pure finops folk don't have: You know what the systems that are running are, and how they operate. You will look at your bill and see things that make no sense: Focus on those.   \nYour are paying for lots of s3 requests instead of cloudfront? Figure out where that is happening in your app. You'll save money and give your customers a better experience.   \nYour ec2 cost is flatter than you would expect? Go adjust your autoscaling.   \nWait, we are not using service X, why are we paying for it? Go clean that shit up.  \nSpending too much in Dynamo transactions? Go reserve some.   \n\nDoing that is important for a few things:\n1. They are a lot more tangible if you come from devops land\n2. You will quickly learn what costs you have control of, and what is just the cost of running your business (that you'll want to commit to, via reserved instances, savings plans, etc). \n3. Optimizing something and not being able to realize savings because you committed first sucks, or worse: you stop looking for improvements because there is no upside\n4. It will help you familiarize yourself with the tooling. And how pricing works\n\nWhile you do that, celebrate those improvements. Post your cost reports trending down and to the right to your leadership.\n\n\nThe second half of the work, involves spreadsheets... a lot of spreadsheets. But ultimately, in most cases, is a question of risk management:\n1. Am I going to need this data if I move it to glacier?\n2. Is a new instance type going to be released that will make more financial sense than staying on a reservation for the old gen. \n3. Are my compute costs going to remain in this level , go up or go down?\n\nIt's very tempting to overanalize to try to get to the optimal number of how much you should reserve / commit. I've been there done that, saved a bunch of money.  \nBut as I say before: this is a risk management game.   \nYou could do a compute savings plan and commit to what you think is the optimal $ ammount for 3 years for that sweet 50% discount.  \nBut you'll be in a lot better position if you commit 1/3 of that for 3 years the first year, another the next, and again thr following year. (You might want to throw some 1yr commits in there too).  \n\nWhat I'm trying to say here is (if you can) don't be afraid to start small. See what impact you have (I've been hit by unexpected things more than once). Once you feel comfortable, and are more familiar with the risks, making decisions get easier, and the bussiness will trust you to make them. \n\nAnd when you do, let people know how much they are saving. Look back after a year and see what your work saved you. Celebrate that shit.  Because next year's budget already assumes you'll do at least as good, and no one will thank you for that again.",

You need to figure out how to predict the changes that different contract terms will make on what you're going to pay for a certain level of use, and you need to game out likely changes in use levels. \n\nA good example of why this is important is that AWS usually offers private pricing on atypical services that not everyone uses, like their speech to text transcription service. Some of them are astoundingly good, to the point where it's worth it to sign up a little higher than your current use because paying the penalty for under-use is *still* cheaper than paying the retail rate for the usage. \n\nThe other thing that usually trips people up is seasonality. most businesses have seasonality in some form, e.g. December is dead or there's a sharp peak at Thanksgiving. Figuring out what your seasonality is and writing contracts so that you're not penalized for your peaks or valleys is important. One of the tricks I'd use with AWS is to change the period for the penalties, e.g. since we had dead spots in July and December I'd ask that our penalties would be calculated for quarterly use or annual use if I could get it instead of monthly use. \n\nThe third is to figure out what the business actually wants. The priority for the CFO is usually not going to be cost *reduction*, it's going to be keeping cloud costs *consistent* and smoothing out any peaks or valleys. But not all finance departments are the same, so you have to ask, and asking this question will often automatically get you a lot of political capital with the finance team. Asking to involve them in PPA negotiations can also help everyone out. \n\nAnd now that I've mentioned it, your most valuable resource in this kind of role isn't technical skill or accuracy. It's political capital. You need to learn how to manage it, which doesn't always mean hoarding it like a dragon.",

Also may need to translate CVE speak into developer speak. \n\nActual risk is then decided together with the developers since they know the application logic and dependency usage, while we (security) can provide details on the vulnerability.\n\nEach company and applications are different, but for me it is very rare for a CVE to be \"this is urgent enough to need to be taken care of today\" with no alternative temporary mitigations available to reduce the risk.\n\n> Why can't these tools give actual context? Like this package is used in auth flow, vulnerability allows account takeover, here's how to fix it. Instead of just screaming CVE numbers at me.\n\nSounds like the tool they are using is working with a software bill of materials and not the code itself (e.g. DependencyTrack). Or the software technically could do it as part of the Software Composition Analysis, but the feature is locked behind a higher cost tier that what they are paying (e.g. Sobarqube). Again you get what you pay for.\n\nAs a bare minimum I'd suggest your manager pushes for the the security team to include the full CVSS scoring, an impact analysis written by the security team in the context of the business, and for the security team to implement a proper ASPM to generate actional tasks and not just CVE checkboxes.",

      "text": "Hi guys,\n\nSo been a devops engineer for 9 years now never really had an issue getting roles. In my last role I transitioned into devsecops during the role was there 3 years. Since I put devsecops on my CV suddenly not getting no interviews. I Thought the fact I brought security skills would help get me hired because my CV IS 90% devops 10% security but for someone reason no roles which I’m not used to.\n\nI would like to ask any devops leads firstly what are you looking when hiring right now (my experience multi cloud, terraform, docker, kubernetes, helm, GitHub argoCD, python, Prometheus, ELK stack, CKAncert) obviously to go into what I done with these would be long but what are you guys looking at when you look at CVs?\n\nSecondly don’t think the devsecops is harming my CV?\n\nThanks ",

I don’t think putting devsecops on your resume necessarily hurts unless you’re making that your main focus and roles hardly mention anything security related on them. \n\nCloud skills will always be the most glaringly relevant thing most folks look at first(aws, gcloud or azure experience) since majority of the time you’ll be working in one of those three. Although there are some companies that still host their own hardware and run k8s. \n\nI personally prefer someone with a relatively short resume. Where the initial summary and past few jobs aligns with skills we’re looking for in our job posting. \n\nThats enough to get a phone screen anyways. The phone screen is really the “important” part to getting further in the process since it’s easy to weed out if your resume is fluff or not. \n\nObviously having a prior connection that works on the team and would recommend you is by far the best route…I don’t think I’ve seen a scenario the candidate didn’t make it through and it’s how I’ve been hired and have hired former coworkers. (Assuming the connection worked with them for a decent amount of time and highly recommends them, not a hand wavey, they were decent type remark)\n\nSome companies are also just bad at taking down “ghost postings” where that position has been filled already yet they send the generic “not a fit for us” email anyways.\n\nLastly I will add…soft/social skills matter now more than ever. You can check the box on all the skills and experience need but another canidiate might have a bit less experience or hasn’t worked exactly in the same stack we are. 9/10 we’re still gonna hire the person who doesn’t seem like an asshole to work with and knows how to communicate effectively, especially if it’s a remote position. \n\nI get the vibe from a lot of postings recently that just having the skills and experience is enough. Maybe for some places where you’re just a cog in the wheel but how you interact is heavily judged and accounted for. When i show up to work it’s enojyable to work with peers who are not only smart but dont come off abrasive/condescending or just straight up rude. Id rather hire a junior i can train up then a senior with that personality imo. (Not saying this is you just in general)",

I have nobody to turn to for guidance on DevOps and good software practices are non-existent so any standards I have are self imposed. \n\nOn the positive end it's very low stress environment.

It seems like the \"tech tree\" of skill progression in programming is more straightforeard, whereas in DevOps i'm just collecting competency in various tooling and configuration formats that don't overlap as much as the things a progammer needs to know.\n\nATM i'm trying to set up a CI/CD pipeline with local github actions (LAN restrictions prevent deployment from github) while reading a book about linux.

          "text": "Honestly, there's a lot of dumb answers in this thread. Far more than usual. \n\nLearning devops is a huge question with no straight answer. There are a lot of different ways to do devops, and the \"right way\" is going to be different for you than it will for me and for the next guy. It also can 100% be done by juniors. Juniors bring new perspectives which are key to organizational success. \n\nThere are major cultural components to devops as well as technical. The cultural piece actually sounds easier than normal, in your case, given the size of your teams. \n\nSomeone posted the road map already. Start there as your technical path to implement. Along the way, read and learn why each of those pieces are necessary. That's where you then begin making the cases to your teams about why you need to do these things, and how to shape the culture to get them done. \n\nOne good thing about devops is that it is very closely tied to the open source world, meaning there's a lot of documentation on everything, and very large user communities to learn specifics from. \n\nGiven your autonomy in your role, you have a fantastic opportunities to really build a strong system without the legacy burdens most other organizations have. You get to do it all here, which will make you a far more effective engineer than most commenting here. Don't let their jaded comments dissuade you.",

Someone can do that when thinking solely about the above, but that usually means missing the big picture of context, which means you get solutions that aren't always matching up with a developer wants or needs.\n\nA junior devops turned into devops in my experience often turns into \"not my problem, here is a log that is 99% filled with nothing related, parse that log and fix it\" type of interaction. A developer turned devops turns into \"I saw this issue, I think it's this from the log, I suspect I can fix it on my end doing x/y, but it would likely be better if y'all did z instead\". That's also someone developers then appreciate and are willing to compromise with much faster, because the developers trust that person to have taken their side into account and how it fits into the big picture.\n\nAnd yes, to fufil that kind of role is hard, that's why good devops people are paid very well. They are both rare, and took a very long time to get to that point in their skills.",

          "text": "I learned it basically as a vocation. I've been a computer nerd since the age of 5. Started a web hosting biz in high school, which exposed me to enterprise grade infrastructure. With the experience I already had, I was hired as the IT director of the independent student newspaper in college for all 4 years (a legit business, with half a million $ revenue each year and 100 business and editorial staff in the office between 9am - 4am, 5 days per week). I had free reign to do whatever improvements I wanted to the infrastructure - workstations and servers/network/storage - that I wanted, as long as the systems were up and healthy. So that was basically my personal lab to experiment with and learn.\n\nI worked as a systems engineer after graduation, gradually working on larger systems in a datacenter. I learned a ton about infrastructure, which I really enjoy because systems engineering is basically about making all the different pieces of infra work together , and build a system that does things.\n\nI taught myself to program as a kid and honed my skills throughout college and after. I got my foot in the door as a devops engineer at my 3rd professional job and started with some crappy AWS systems that me and my teammate slowly built out using best practices and terraform. Thats how I learned about infra automation and deployment pipelines. \n\nIn summary, I learn best by working on projects, which involve making multiple different parts work together. Code is the glue that ties everything together and automates it. I hate classroom learning because it is boring. Project work gives me great satisfaction because I have an end creation that works and does things, that I can feel proud of.\n\nI have taught some of my friends how to transition to devops/SRE work, by assigning them this project:\n\n* Sign up for a free AWS account.\n* Write a simple software service in your language of choice. Maybe a python flask application that serves a simple user signup and login form and an API with /user and /auth endpoints. Then create 2 microservices  to handle user creation (CRUD - create, read, update, delete) and login (validates username and password , responds with either a token or a 403 permission error) . Use mysql as your datastore; create an appropriate database schema.\n* Containerize each of those 3 applications with Docker/containerd by writing a simple dockerfile in the code root of each, and building the images\n* Set up a mysql/mariadb server and ECS cluster or EKS cluster in the AWS console. Use the smallest instance type. You get a very limited free budget each month from AWS and costs can quickly balloon, so terminate them when you arent working on your project and re-provision when you do. Write this in terraform at some point, so that you get terraform experience. AI can be tremendously helpful and will show you how to do it. Dont just rely on the AI to do it for you, pay attention to what infra it wants to create and how the configs relate to one another\n* Write a bash script to copy the docker images you created to the ECS container repo and deploy them into the ECS or EKS cluster\n* Debug things until you are able to load your UI through your browser and the microservices work as intended. You will be able to see the data is getting stored in the database\n\nHave fun! 😅 I love this stuff and it is a great career that pays $$$$. As an SRE I am responsible for ensuring system performance and uptime, which means that being on-call is a fact of life. A software engineer can cost the company money with crappy/buggy/insecure code, but an SRE can cost a company millions of $$ and the company's reputation if they do a poor job. We get paid so much because we have a critical responsibility. Unfortunately it is a thankless job because when everything is working well, nobody cares that we exist. But when things dont work, the hammer comes down and the bosses are like \"why did you let this happen, why didnt you catch this sooner and fix it faster???\"",

The only thing you can do, is do it cheaper but that's highly variable and a lot like man vs machine.  This subreddit would disagree with me but the way tools and problems will be solved is changing drastically across the board.\n\nEssentially, you should understand MLOps, which is supporting models, config, launching, etc. however, you're going to use LLMs to troubleshoot and figure out solutions.  The only way around this is to lab, setup linux machines, have them talk to each other, host distributed systems, run kubernetes clusters, create issues, fix them, rinse repeat.\n\nI never labbed in a distributed env but I used Linux as a daily driver, which is full of enough stuff to learn.  If you want the minimal input with the highest ROI then build out an arch linux daily driver and never look back.  I use Fedora because I just want stuff to work and it's a desktop version of RHEL, so the experience is pretty nice.  Arch forces you understand things better and make tradeoffs especially when installing fresh software.\n\nAll in all, devops is for the people who are too nerdy to stay in software engineering because of the politics but still want to write a lil code, write a lil config, monitor systems, etc.\n\nEdit: if anyone bashes you (no pun intended) then ask for their github.  At the end of the day DevOps engineers write software and should have something to show for that knowledge.  Take care!",

But lately? They're giving me SDE level challenges.  Hash tables are one thing, but linked lists? Binary Search? The last interview I had my jaw dropped.  It was painfully difficult.

But oh, what's this? the configmap has a python script thats... 300 lines long? And it's broken? So now I have to debug and fix it as well? All this in 15 mins? Oh, look here.  It's using a redis package.  Great, I haven't touched the redis package in months.  A lot of these methods called are vaguely familiar and some i've never used.  Can I look at the official docs? No? Why not? Oh, because in the real world, engineers don't consult docs on the internet.  Sorry. My bad. \n\n  \nAbsolute insanity.  At one point I just started laughing mid interview. I knew I was cooked.  When I had a call with the recruiter after, he was insanely apologetic.  I told him to put a note down that any other candidate going through these interviews should basically be an SWE.  My way of giving the next person a massive heads up.\n\nI had to do double takes and re-read the job descriptions. Amazingly, the job descriptions all involved: IaC, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Observability, Scaling Systems, Reliability engineering... you know.. Devops stuff.  \n\nI wonder - is this becoming the norm now? Are the skills I have just misaligned and not really DevOps? Interviews like this make me feel like a fraud, tbh.  It's like all the experience I have building infrastructure, scaling systems, writing operators, hammering away at terraform means nothing to these companies.  They just want a SWE that does infra.\n\n",

You get a few simple tasks tackling different areas (cli tooling, ansible, terraform, docker, troubleshooting, etc). You are given unlimited resources, including ChatGPT. You are doing it all ssh'd into a VM. You just have to share your screen while you do it. I generally know if someone is going to do well in the first 30 seconds. \n\nThe methods are intentionally left wide open. If you want to write Python to pull some fields out of a json api, that's fine. If you want to curl | jq, that's also fine. The test is designed to replicate tasks that you would normally do in the creation and maintenance of infrastructure. It is also designed to cause you headaches if you don't know tooling or can't do a simple google search. \n\nThe test is about how you approach a problem and can you quickly acquire the knowledge to solve it if you don't already possess it. How you reference docs, how you google search, how you prompt LLMs reveals just about all I need to know about you. It is wild to me how many people assume the shape of data and never once actually look at it. \n\nActual senior engineers plow through my interview in under 20 minutes. Less senior, but competent will usually finish in the allotted hour. People that have no idea what they are doing, usually try to grep json, unformatted, and get stuck for 30 minutes completing a two minute task.",

Take time and research stuff before doing stuff. Most likely there is community standards and best practices for most stuff you need. Don't try to invent your own smart solutions",

If all you're doing is tying together off-the-shelf components then you can probably declare a few off-the-shelf dependencies and their values and call it job done.

But this interacts very badly with my next point...\n\nDevops often seems to be full of people who've failed at SWE or who are at the very beginning of their careers.

Nore does DevOps require \"agile\" processes.\n\n>A lot of companies have moved away what was known as Anti-pattern Type-B with a DevOps team that sits in the middle of development and operations teams.\n\nAside from a few hottake blogs, no one knows this term much less uses it.  And if anything the industry has only *accelerated* its movement towards it rather than away from it, at least when it comes to larger enterprises.\n\n>That role is acutally going away that's been taken over by SRE/Cloud/Platform Engineering teams on the operations side. The middle man DevOps Engineer is removed because it creates a third silio thats inefficient. No need of a seperate CI/CD pipline specialist that slows things down.\n\nNo it's not.  First off if you actually read the entire blog posts you're regurgitating you'd know in the myth that \"SRE\" and \"Cloud\" Engineering roles/teams are just job responsibilities that everyone on the mythical two pizza box \"DevOps Culture Powered Super Team\" is expected to have.  Because it's easy and cheap to build teams entirely comprised of ultra-high-10x-performing super developers where everyone can do everything.\n\nAnd you'd also understand that \"Platform Engineering\" is literally the polar opposite of moving away from \"Anti-pattern Type-B\" DevOps teams.  That's because Platform Engineering is *literally* \"DevOps As A Service\" where the role/team of DevOps has been so completely siloed off that it has become a first class product in and of itself.  It's the natural end-state of DevOps is a role -> DevOps is a team -> DevOps is a service -> DevOps service is rebranded Platform Engineering so we can all get a salary bump.",

Most enterprises *do not run a homelab* (imagine... crazy shit right there) and have a ton of organizational policies that you need to implement and abide by that are different anywhere. Your tinkering at home with none of that context is just as useless as getting your certs in terms of being capable of actually doing the job.\n\nOverall bad advice and just silly rage bait for certifications. You don't present any sort of useful alternative nor do you add any sort of context of who it's for pretending like this is good general advice. I hope no one listens to you and I feel truly bad for any junior folks who might be relying on your poor takes to develop their careers.\n\nYour baseline premise that learning DevOps in a 6 week bootcamp is not possible is fine (and truly not unpopular as many note), but boy the content of your post is just full of being really freaking ignorant.",

      "text": "Hey r/devops,\n\nRecently I finished a months long rewrite of the Locust K8s operator (Java → Go) and wanted to share with you since it is both relevant to the subreddit (CICD was one of the main reasons for this operator to exist in the first place) and also a huge milestone for the project. The performance gains were better than expected, but the migration path was way harder than I thought!\n\n# The Numbers\n\n**Before (Java/JVM):**\n\n* Memory: 256MB idle\n* Startup: \\~60s (JVM warmup) (optimisation could have been applied) \n* Image: 128MB (compressed)\n\n**After (Go):**\n\n* Memory: 64MB idle (4x reduction)\n* Startup: <1s (60x faster)\n* Image: 30-34MB (compressed)\n\n# Why The Rewrite\n\nHonestly, i could have kept working with Java. Nothing wrong with the language (this is not Java is trash kind of post)  and it is very stable specially for enterprise (the main environment where the operator runs). That being said, it became painful to support in terms of adding features and to keep the project up to date and patched. Migrating between framework and language versions got very demanding very quickly where i would need to spend sometimes up word of a week to get stuff to work again after a framework update.   \n  \nMoreover, adding new features became harder overtime because of some design & architectural directions I put in place early in the project. So a breaking change was needed anyway to allow the operator to keep growing and accommodate the new feature requests its users where kindly sharing with me. Thus, i decided to bite the bullet and rewrite the thing into Go. The operator was originally written in 2021 (open sourced in 2022) and my views on how to do architecture and cloud native designs have grown since then! \n\n# What Actually Mattered\n\nThe startup time was a win. In CI/CD pipelines, waiting a full minute for the operator to initialize before load tests could run was painful. Now it's instant. Of corse this assumes you want to deploy the operator with every pipeline run with a bit of \"cooldown\" in case several tests will run in a row. this enable the use of full elastic node groups in AWS EKS for example.\n\nThe memory reduction also matters in multi-tenant clusters where you're running multiple tests from multiple teams at the same time. That 4x drop adds up when you're paying for every MB.\n\n# What Was Harder Than Expected\n\n**Conversion webhooks for CRD API compatibility.** I needed to maintain v1 API support while adding v2 features. This is to help with the migration and enhance the user experience as much as possible. Bidirectional conversion (v1 ↔ v2) is brutal; you have to ensure no data loss in either direction (for the things that matter). This took longer than the actual operator rewrite.also to deal with the need cert manager was honestly a bit of a headache!\n\nIf you're planning API versioning in operators, seriously budget extra time for this.\n\n# What I Added in v2\n\nSince I was rewriting anyway, I threw in some features that were painful to add in the Java version and was in demand by the operator's users:\n\n* OpenTelemetry support (no more sidecar for metrics)\n* Proper K8s secret/env injection (stop hardcoding credentials)\n* Better resource cleanup when tests finish\n* Pod health monitoring with auto-recovery\n* Leader election for HA deployments\n* Fine-grained control over load generation pods\n\n# Quick Example\n\n    apiVersion: locust.io/v2\n    kind: LocustTest\n    metadata:\n      name: api-load-test\n    spec:\n      image: locustio/locust:2.31.8\n      testFiles:\n        configMapRef: my-test-scripts\n      master:\n        autostart: true\n      worker:\n        replicas: 10\n      env:\n        secretRefs:\n        - name: api-credentials\n      observability:\n        openTelemetry:\n          enabled: true\n          endpoint: \"http://otel-collector:4317\"\n\n# Install\n\n    helm repo add locust-k8s-operator https://abdelrhmanhamouda.github.io/locust-k8s-operator\n    helm install locust-operator locust-k8s-operator/locust-k8s-operator --version 2.1.1\n\n**Links:** [GitHub](https://github.com/AbdelrhmanHamouda/locust-k8s-operator) | [Docs](https://abdelrhmanhamouda.github.io/locust-k8s-operator/)\n\nAnyone else doing Java→Go operator rewrites?

Another point is that for an enterprise with Java as main language that has to introduce a new language, with locust, devs can use python for both the scripting language AND extending the engine when needed (happened a lot). With k6 you can’t do that, you must use Go to extend the engine and js for scripting. This as one can imagine makes things more complex.

Also, first-class SBOM management and policy enforcement tied to CI would be huge.\n\nIf you’re building this, I’d focus hard on: HA story, backup/restore simplicity, and how it behaves at scale (1000s of repos, heavy CI churn).

Drift observability is honestly still rough, that's the part I'm least happy with and it's high on the roadmap.\n\nSBOM (CycloneDX + SPDX) and CVE tracking are built in.

          "text": "Apple's DevOps interviews typically run 4-6 rounds and they're going to hit you hard on fundamentals - expect deep dives into infrastructure as code, CI/CD pipelines, containerization, monitoring, and incident response. They care a lot about how you think through problems and your ability to explain complex technical decisions in simple terms. The compensation is competitive with other FAANG companies, so for mid-level you're looking at 180-250K total comp, senior can push 300K+, and staff+ goes well beyond that. Don't overthink the \"Apple culture\" thing - just be genuine, show you can collaborate, and demonstrate that you understand production systems at scale. As for what not to say, avoid badmouthing previous employers and don't pretend to know something you don't - they'll catch you immediately.\n\nYou're going to make it further than you think if you focus on articulating your actual experience clearly rather than memorizing textbook answers. They want to see how you've solved real problems, not how well you can recite best practices. Talk about your failures and what you learned from them - that's actually valuable to interviewers. The technical bar is high but it's not impossible, and the fact that you got the interview means someone already thinks you have what it takes. If you want some help articulating your experience better during the actual interview, I built [AI Assistant](http://interviews.chat) to sell yourself more effectively when you're in the hot seat.",

We had custom metrics that literally nobody has queried in like 6 months, health check logs just burning through our indexed volume for no reason, dashboards that the person who made them doesn't even work here anymore. You know how it goes :0\n\nEnded up cutting like 30% just from the obvious stuff but it was all manual. Just me going through dashboards and monitors trying to figure out what's actually being used vs what's just sitting there costing money\n\nHow do you guys handle this? Does anyone actually do regular cleanups or does the bill just grow until finance starts asking questions? And how do you even figure out what's safe to remove without breaking someone's alert? \n\nCurious to hear anyone's \"why the hell are we paying for this\" moments, especially from bigger teams since I'm at a smaller company and still figuring out what normal looks like\n\nThanks in advance! :)",

Anything orphaned goes on a list. We review it monthly and it takes maybe 20 minutes now. The first time we ran it we found over 40% of our custom metrics weren't referenced anywhere.\n\nThe other thing that saved us real money was being aggressive about log exclusion filters at the agent level.

If nobody complains, it's safe to remove.\n\nOne thing that helped us beyond the Datadog-specific cleanup: we started tracking observability cost as a percentage of infrastructure cost. If your monitoring bill is more than \\~5-8% of what you're monitoring, something is off. It's a simple ratio but it gives you a sanity check and a number to track over time.\n\nFor the \"how do you know what's safe to remove\" question — we wrote a simple script that hits the DD API to find metrics not referenced in any dashboard or monitor, and also checks the metrics/search endpoint to see last query time. The combination of \"not in any dashboard AND not queried in 60 days\" is a pretty safe removal candidate.\n\nThe root cause though is what another commenter said — treat your observability pipeline like application code. New metrics should go through a review process just like new infrastructure. If you don't gate it, it'll grow unchecked.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m a junior developer (around 1.5 years of experience). I was hired for a software developer role. I’m not some super strong 10x engineer or anything, but I get stuff done. I’ve worked with Python before, built features, written scripts, worked with Azure DevOps (not super in-depth, but enough to be functional).\n\nRecently though, I’ve been asked to work on Jenkins pipelines at my firm. This is my first time properly working on CI/CD at an enterprise level.\n\nThey’ve asked me to create a baked-in container and write a Jenkinsfile. I can read the existing code and mostly understand what’s happening, but when it comes to building something similar myself, I just get confused.\n\nIt’s enterprise-level infra, so there are tons of permission issues, access restrictions, random failures, etc. The original setup was done by someone who has left the company, and honestly no one in my team fully understands how everything is wired together. So I’m basically trying to reverse-engineer the whole thing.\n\nOn top of that, I’m also expected to work on Airflow DAGs to automate certain Python scripts. I’ve worked on Airflow before, but that setup was completely different — the DAG configs were already structured. Here, I have to build DAGs from scratch and everything feels scattered. I’m confused about database access, where connections are defined, how everything is deployed, etc.\n\nSo it’s Jenkins + baked containers + Airflow DAGs + infra + permissions… all at once.\n\nI’m constantly scared of breaking something or messing up pipelines that other teams rely on. I’m not that strong with Linux either, so that adds another layer of stress. I spend a lot of time staring at configs, feeling overwhelmed, and then I get so mentally drained that I don’t make much progress.\n\nThe environment itself isn’t toxic. No one is yelling at me. But internally I feel like I’m underperforming. I keep worrying that I’ll disappoint the people who trusted me when they hired me, and that they’ll think I was the wrong hire.\n\nHas anyone else been thrown into heavy CI/CD + infra work early in their career without proper documentation or mentorship?\n\nHow do you deal with the overwhelm and the fear of breaking things? And how do you stop feeling like you don’t belong?\n\nWould really appreciate any advice. 🙏",

          "text": "First of all, congratulations! Not everyone gets an opportunity to learn like this. It might not feel like it now, but this is probably the best position you could be in. Any competent senior engineer I’ve worked with has had to go through something similar. There is always a feeling of being overwhelmed but just tackle one thing at a time, use Claude or ChaGPT as a glorified google and learn each part by pasting the error for an overview and using documentation to understand exactly. Too many juniors/mids go straight to AI these days and don’t put in the hard miles, but it sounds like you have the right mindset. \n\nThe only thing I would say is be honest and tell your manager that you can’t juggle both things, the DAGs in Airflow AND working out the Jenkins setup is not achievable, unless given time. Even for a senior that would asking a lot. Just be honest, something I learnt through my career is it’s not a sign of weakness to admit you don’t know something. I find juniors and even mid level guys are terrified of this but I promise, no one is going to look down on you for not knowing. That’s our job to work things out, you just get a bit quicker at it once you’ve been in the game a while. Anyway, good luck, like I say, it sounds like you have the right mindset to learn and progress so stick at it.",

In reality though, no package manager means rewriting every Dockerfile from scratch or maintaining dual images like some amateur hour setup.\n\nDid my homework and found countless teams hitting the same brick wall. Pipelines that worked fine suddenly break because you cant install debugging tools, cant troubleshoot in production, cant do basic system tasks without a shell.\n\nThe problem is security team wants minimal images with no vulnerabilities but dev team needs to actually ship features without spending half their time babysitting Docker builds. We tried multi-stage builds where you use Ubuntu or Alpine for the build stage then copy to distroless for runtime but now our CI/CD takes forever and we rebuild constantly when base images update.\n\nAlso nobody talks about what happens when you need to actually debug something in prod. You cant exec into a distroless container and poke around. You cant install tools. You basically have to maintain a whole separate debug image just to troubleshoot.\n\nHow are you all actually solving this without it becoming a full-time job? Whats the workflow for keeping familiar build tools (apt, apk, curl, whatever) while still shipping lean secure runtime images? Is there tooling that helps manage this mess or is everyone just accepting the pain?\n\nRunning on AWS ECS.

I'm curious, the only time I know it could be helpful is when you have a memory leak only in the real environment.

The problem of CVE is fixing it but letting the container to reboot with upgraded image. The development team will insist on your to keep a scheduled maintenance window. But you'll worry about running the container with a known vulnerability until the next scheduled maintenance window. So, if you insist on you dev team to build robust application that will not be affected with a reboot, you don't need to have planned maintenance. You can have a simple automatic script which will keep fixing all the CVEs as and when they appear.",

Combine that with multi stage builds and automated scanning and you can actually get distroless like security without constantly rewriting Dockerfiles or maintaining a full separate debug image.

I would say that, for the orgs I work with, both the answers here are the best answers:\n\n1. Ensure that you have usable telemetry that reduces your need to interactively troubleshoot.  \n\n2. Build out a pattern using \\`kubectl debug\\` and an image built with all the tools you might need to debug so that you're ready when a team can't figure it out from their telemetry.\n\nSaying that you should have such amazing telemetry that you never have to interactively debug is a great philosophical position; however, my sense is that most orgs will never justify the levels of overhead and storage that might be necessary to do that SO OVERWHELMINGLY that they'll never need to break glass and debug interactively.  Better to have the pattern available, not need it, and eventually deprecate it than to need it and not have it.\n\nThere's also, always:\n\n3. Just ram \\`bash\\` and other basic tools in your distroless image.\n\nI \\_don't\\_ advocate this but, sometimes, the politics of the situation are that getting teams to give up the ability to \\`kubectl exec\\` in is, sometimes, too big a reach to start with.
