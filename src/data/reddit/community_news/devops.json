I collected all that plus other questions that I found on glassdoor, blind etc in a github repo. I've added my own video explanations to solve those questions. \n\nit's free and I hope this will help you to prepare and pass. If you ever feel like thanking me just Star the repository.\n\nhttps://github.com/devops-interviews/devops-interviews ",

      "text": "I wrapped up a tech panel for a Principal Azure Engineer role at an investment bank a couple of hours ago. This followed an interview with the hiring manager last Wednesday. We know each other from the past, i.e., I’ve interviewed for multiple roles at this firm over the last 5-6 years.\n\nThis role landed on my LinkedIn feed randomly. I commented on the post and emailed the hiring manager directly, we had a short back-and-forth, and his recruiter called me almost immediately. The process has been unusually smooth by modern standards.\n\nToday’s panel felt strong. I’m confident I cleared the bar with both the Azure SME and the hiring manager. I saw visible agreement on several answers, got verbal acknowledgment more than once and handled questions from a junior panelist with ease. I was told that I’m “first in line” (not sure if that means FIFO or first on the shortlist), however,  it seemed to be directionally positive.\n\nHere’s the problem: I was laid off a little over six months ago and I am EXHAUSTED. It's like I've been on the hamster wheels of interviews since 8/4/2025. I’ve done the prep, the loops, the panels, the follow-ups. I know I’m good enough to be gainfully employed as a DevOps engineer.\n\nIf this role doesn’t turn into an offer, I’m seriously questioning whether I want to continue in tech at all. I don’t know if I have it in me to keep doing 5–7 round interview gauntlets, only to be rejected for vague reasons like “culture fit” or not smiling enough. I’ve given my adult life to STEM / engineering / corporate IT / tech and I am exhausted from having to engage with recruiters who want someone to take managerial roles for IC level pay.\n\nI’m not bitter about rejection. I’m tired of dysfunction...hiring managers who don’t know the difference between EC2 and AWS Lambda, recruiters who can’t distinguish an AWS account from an Azure subscription and BS interview processes that ding candidates for being \"too intense\".\n\nSo I’m asking honestly: when is it time to walk away?\nFor those who’ve been at a similar crossroads...did you step back temporarily, change strategy or leave tech altogether?\n\n\nTL;DR: Six months, countless interviews, strong signals in today's tech panel. If today's tech panel doesn’t result in an offer, I’m seriously considering being done with the tech interview industrial complex.",

I had a couple decent contracts, tried different things. I had a 4 month stretch where I didn't have any work, so i started live streaming on YouTube. We were getting ready to release Cassandra 5 (I'm a committer) so I just did sessions about it, and it got a surprising amount of interest. I wrote my own tooling to provision database environments and it includes a lot of performance analysis tools, so I would show people how to understand how the DB behaves.  \n\nRegarding interviewing, after speaking at a conference Microsoft asked me to interview for a principle engineer position to run the Cassandra fleet.  Want to know how many database questions they asked me in my interview?  Zero. Instead they asked me to write shortest path in Java in a Google doc.  I haven't needed to even think about that in 20 years. I found it was easier to just have fun doing what I like instead of trying to conform to what an employer wanted me to be.  I absolutely *hated* working in big tech.  Now I'm working on stuff I actually love working on, because I get to make all my own decisions and do exactly what I want, whenever I want.\n\nI won't say it's easy, but it's rewarding if you can muscle through it. Find a niche you enjoy, talk about it, become relevant.  Make it easy for people to find you. \n\nGood luck.",

I did a hail Mary and started something on my own that actually grew out nicely. Sold it and went into contracting work. \n\nFinancial crisis arrived. Lost the contracting gigs as the whole marked dried out. I could not go bartending as now I had a family with kids and mortgage to pay. Went through my nest egg quickly. By the time my nest egg was gone I found work again.\n\nAfter COVID the startup I was working for. That had still a 4 year runway decided to cut 30% of their engineers. I lost my job again. Couple of months with no work either. Back at work again but only due to the fact I offered myself at 50% of my normal rate. Lucky I am now back in a position I can work as a bartender and pay all my bills. \n\nIt will all go with ups and downs. I know this is not advice.

I've had 3 jobs in the past 5 years, including one layoff w/ severance but then I re-read your post...\n\nAs a senior I interview and hire candidates pretty frequently now. It sounds like you're having no issues with getting interviews or getting to the tech round and you seem confident in how the tech round went, so.... \n\nWithout trying to sound like an ass. How would you say your social skills are? \n\nWe could interview the smartest, most technically skilled person who checks all the boxes we're looking for but if their social skills are not great. It's going to be a no. \n\nHonestly I feel my social skills have won me over other candidates that might be more \"technically better\". No one wants to work with an asshole every day or that person who thinks they're giving constructive feedback on PRs but it's really just condescending comments. I would almost go as far to say that [social skills:technical] chops is a 70:30~ ratio when considering a candidate. Obviously the reverse isn't good either(great social skills, lots of fluff on resume, lying about projects or how much they helped in said project, etc) \n\n\nedit: also to clarify, when I say \"social skills\" I don't mean how well you can present or lead a retro. I basically mean do you come off warm/friendly? Folks wouldn't be intimated to ask you a question? You can have back and forth feedback/discussion on ideas, problems & solutions without being flustered etc. I suck at presentations and avoid them when I can lol...\n\nThat's the only thing that comes to mind when someone says they get a lot of interviews, make it to the technical/final round but haven't landed anything. Outside of asking for some insane compensation package or not being open to anything but major established corporations/industries.",

People dont waste time on candidates they dont think will work out in the interview process.\n\nDo some learnings, find some very good questions to ask THEM about their org so you can get a feel and they will know you're not fresh off the campus.\n\nA book that has helped me is that old Dale Carnegie how to win friends and influence people, and it all comes down to getting into their head about their needs and what you can perceive. It goes into non-verbals, mirroring being authentic and engaged without being too much. Highly recommend it, if you have any inclination youre being screened on an intrapersonal basis rather than technical.\n\nIf youre getting screened out in the technical interviews, then it could be a sign of just needing work on clear technical communication, I dont have any book recs on that one.\n\nKeep grinding, for every 1000 potential opportunities 10 might work out and 1 of those might be the perfect fit. That's the norm, we have just been in a golden age for the past decade and the winds are changing. Stay up on hard AI tech (not just prompts) and dont get left behind.",

I created my own digital products, my own marketing, and got into solutions architecting, working directly with startups in my area. It was fascinating and exercised the \"bigger picture\" part of my brain; speaking with clients, translating technical needs, creating contracts.\n\nThen the pandemic happened and flipped everything on its head. Projects were on hold, people were afraid, and there was a lot of hesitation. Cancelled my lease, moved in with parents, and spent a lot of time trying to pivot into global markets (a lot of SEO, outreach.. BS, boxed wine) but it wasn't very fruitful.\n\nI ended up getting back into traditional employment, but if I had to do it again I would double down on local gig economies and traditional marketing. It felt like I was giving back to my community, making a difference, and seeing the product from start to finish. Rather than orgs interviewing me if I was a fit, I was interviewing them if I could help. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to step away from traditional big orgs, even if its just temporarily.",

We hash the request ID and sample deterministically so you can still trace a specific request if needed.\n\n3. **Pre-filter before shipping** - We run a lightweight log processor on the app server that drops known noise (health checks, bot requests, etc.) before sending to our log aggregator. Cuts volume by ~40%.\n\n4. **Retention tiers** - Hot logs (7 days) in fast storage, warm logs (30 days) in cheaper storage, cold logs (90+ days) in S3/GCS with Athena/BigQuery for occasional queries.\n\nWhat's your current stack?

Thats why storage ends up costing more than the servers.\n\nFew things that helped me\n\nSelf hosting your observability stack (Grafana + Loki + Prometheus, or SigNoz as an all in one Datadog replacement) saves a ton but now youre babysitting more services. Worth it if you have the bandwith.\n\nSwitching to a platform that bundles observability into compute cost was the bigger win for me. I moved to Quave ONE and the built in Grafana dashboards, ingress metrics grouped by path/status/response time, app logs with search and WAF logs just come included. No agents, no collectors, no seperate bill. Covers like 80% of what I was paying Datadog for. Railway and Render have some built in metrics too and Coolify is solid if you want full self hosting on your own VPS.\n\nIf youre staying on Datadog/New Relic at least look at Grafana Cloud, free tier is surprisingly generous (50GB logs, 10k series) and paid is way cheaper per GB. Also ask your vendor about committed use discounts, most people dont and leave money on the table.\n\nThe logging hygene advice everyone else gave is real but if your setup is structurally designed to charge you twice for everything no amount of sampling fixes the underlying problem.",

Because behind the scene internally they have to manage more replicas for the backened.\n\nSo you have to check the ingestion layer first.

That isn't security, those are just glorified sysadmins spinning up software, throwing the results at other departments and not generating any benefit/value for the company (either because they are incompetent, or because management decided to get a bunch of junior level knowledge people; you get what you pay for).\n\n> I'm supposed to drop whatever sprint work I'm on, research the CVE, find where we use that package, assess actual risk, test the upgrade, and hope nothing breaks.\n\nI'm mostly with you here, security team should definitely have provided a list of impacted applications/modules/libraries, checked if the CVE is even potentially relevant (e.g. affects LDAP but it is known the application doesn't use LDAP), provided an initial impact or risk assessment (which then transfers to \"what priority does this ticket even have\"), scope, potential mitigations aside from \"update the dependency\". Also may need to translate CVE speak into developer speak. \n\nActual risk is then decided together with the developers since they know the application logic and dependency usage, while we (security) can provide details on the vulnerability.\n\nEach company and applications are different, but for me it is very rare for a CVE to be \"this is urgent enough to need to be taken care of today\" with no alternative temporary mitigations available to reduce the risk.\n\n> Why can't these tools give actual context? Like this package is used in auth flow, vulnerability allows account takeover, here's how to fix it. Instead of just screaming CVE numbers at me.\n\nSounds like the tool they are using is working with a software bill of materials and not the code itself (e.g. DependencyTrack). Or the software technically could do it as part of the Software Composition Analysis, but the feature is locked behind a higher cost tier that what they are paying (e.g. Sobarqube). Again you get what you pay for.\n\nAs a bare minimum I'd suggest your manager pushes for the the security team to include the full CVSS scoring, an impact analysis written by the security team in the context of the business, and for the security team to implement a proper ASPM to generate actional tasks and not just CVE checkboxes.",

The expectation from our management is to drop everything and fix it immediately!\n\nWe've tried to push back on this but have failed. The security team is not technical and doesn't understand our system at all so are incapable of actually triaging issues. For a while we were even told we cannot have any vulnerabilities of any severity on anything. Thankfully there was such a massive uproar to the stupidity of that request that they changed it to no critical or highs. Which is still a stupid policy because it's a blanket rule without any context or assessment into actual risk to any of our actual products.\n\n\nI honestly don't know what happened, but it used to be more reasonable where you'd assess risk and then if it was determined there was no real risk. You just had to write a quick little justification. Send it off to the security team and they would approve exemptions. Now. They seem to refuse to approve any exemptions no matter what for any reason. \n\nI brought this up with my manager about how much of a massive waste of time this is and how it's completely insane and crippling us. I was told that they understand and they agree but that it's out of their hands. It's coming from a much higher level. I was literally told that it does not matter what the cost or consequences are. We have to meet the requirement even if it breaks things. So since I work on multiple projects I've been \"very busy\" with other projects lately and \"I haven't had time to work on these other projects\" with these insane security requirements!",

I've had to talk to my coworkers just about the jira hell they create.\n\n\nTooling matters a lot here and I think has improved a lot over the years. We generally do like a 2 week evaluation of testing tools before buying them, and I do a pretty deep dive on quality of automated triage.\n\n\nMy main tool is Semgrep Pro. It includes pretty good reachability analysis and the sast severity errs on the side of not being too sensationalist. Can highly recommend it vs the other tools I've evaluated. Automated tickets are created for anything that's reachable above high severity, and the tooling does a good job with it. I review all tickets before assigning them to a team, and have a Slack bot that informe me or every new vuln.\nThe reachability analysis requires zero setup, but it will miss things and can't evaluate every eco system / package whatever. Every ticket includes the tool summary description, a link back to the security tool, and the commit that introduced the issue.\n\n\nOn the infrastructure security side, both Wiz and Orca seem to do a good job at context and ranking issues, but are expensive. They have AppSec tooling as well but I haven't evaluated them.",

The fake one had a postinstall hook that tried to exfil environment variables.\n\nI asked our security team what we do about this. They said use npm audit. npm audit only catches KNOWN vulnerabilities. It does nothing for zero-days or typosquatting.\n\nSo now I'm sitting here with a script took me months to complete that scans packages for sketchy patterns before CI merges them. It blocks stuff like curl | bash in lifecycle hooks ,Reading process.env and making HTTP calls ,Obfuscated eval() calls and Binary files where they shouldn't be and many more\n\nWorks fine. Caught the fake package. Also flagged two legitimate packages (torch and tensorflow) because they download binaries during install, but whatever just whitelist those.\n\nMy manager thinks I'm wasting time. \"Just use Snyk\" he says. Snyk costs $1200/month and still doesn't catch typosquatting.\n\nAm I crazy or is everyone else just accepting this risk?\n\nTool: [https://github.com/Otsmane-Ahmed/ci-supplychain-guard](https://github.com/Otsmane-Ahmed/ci-supplychain-guard)",

Socket.dev — does static analysis of packages before install, catches typosquatting and suspicious behavior patterns. Way cheaper than Snyk and specifically designed for this problem.\n\n2. Lockfile auditing in CI — diff the lockfile on every PR. New dependency additions should be reviewed like code changes, not rubber stamped.\n\n3. npm config set ignore-scripts true globally, then whitelist the packages that legitimately need lifecycle hooks. Most packages do not need postinstall.

Humans are imperfect humans but the ones following best practices are less likely to become the weak leak leading to distribution of an exploit. We aren't at this time code-reviewing or running any static-code-analysis on these libraries, although it's not a terrible idea in principle.

Immutable backups, specifically. The thing you hope you'll never need, but will allow you to tell ransomware perpetrators to fuck off while rebuilding infrastructure from IaC and loading backups.\n\nWhether what you're doing is \"wasting time\" depends on the security stance in your organization which is up to technical leadership. Do the perceived risk of not using this outweigh the cost of maintaining it? Does the organization have the collective expertise to maintain an internal security scanning tool vs getting the best available existing coverage off the shelf?

          "text": "Hiring should typically pick up in a few months. I don’t think putting devsecops on your resume necessarily hurts unless you’re making that your main focus and roles hardly mention anything security related on them. \n\nCloud skills will always be the most glaringly relevant thing most folks look at first(aws, gcloud or azure experience) since majority of the time you’ll be working in one of those three. Although there are some companies that still host their own hardware and run k8s. \n\nI personally prefer someone with a relatively short resume. Where the initial summary and past few jobs aligns with skills we’re looking for in our job posting. \n\nThats enough to get a phone screen anyways. The phone screen is really the “important” part to getting further in the process since it’s easy to weed out if your resume is fluff or not. \n\nObviously having a prior connection that works on the team and would recommend you is by far the best route…I don’t think I’ve seen a scenario the candidate didn’t make it through and it’s how I’ve been hired and have hired former coworkers. (Assuming the connection worked with them for a decent amount of time and highly recommends them, not a hand wavey, they were decent type remark)\n\nSome companies are also just bad at taking down “ghost postings” where that position has been filled already yet they send the generic “not a fit for us” email anyways.\n\nLastly I will add…soft/social skills matter now more than ever. You can check the box on all the skills and experience need but another canidiate might have a bit less experience or hasn’t worked exactly in the same stack we are. 9/10 we’re still gonna hire the person who doesn’t seem like an asshole to work with and knows how to communicate effectively, especially if it’s a remote position. \n\nI get the vibe from a lot of postings recently that just having the skills and experience is enough. Maybe for some places where you’re just a cog in the wheel but how you interact is heavily judged and accounted for. When i show up to work it’s enojyable to work with peers who are not only smart but dont come off abrasive/condescending or just straight up rude. Id rather hire a junior i can train up then a senior with that personality imo. (Not saying this is you just in general)",

Over 16tb of data sitting in standard storage doing nothing. S3 bill for that account reduced by 75 percent after a week. \n\nParent company in Europe added some cool new security tool that some company sold them at aws summit. Had a brand new account that had almost no resources in it that was getting charged almost 150 dollars after a week of being deployed in cloud trail charges because it had enabled a second cloud trail log.

I ran through that carousel.\n\n  \nOne thing that bothered me the most were companies that without warning - would put me in a coding challenge.  Sure, it's expected.  It's part of the job.  But lately? They're giving me SDE level challenges.  Hash tables are one thing, but linked lists? Binary Search? The last interview I had my jaw dropped.  It was painfully difficult. They wanted me to solve a problem involving ping pong balls in a room of x size.  I was floored.  Second challenge - fix a kubernetes manifest issue.  Easy peasy in my book.  No problem.  But oh, what's this? the configmap has a python script thats... 300 lines long? And it's broken? So now I have to debug and fix it as well? All this in 15 mins? Oh, look here.  It's using a redis package.  Great, I haven't touched the redis package in months.  A lot of these methods called are vaguely familiar and some i've never used.  Can I look at the official docs? No? Why not? Oh, because in the real world, engineers don't consult docs on the internet.  Sorry. My bad. \n\n  \nAbsolute insanity.  At one point I just started laughing mid interview. I knew I was cooked.  When I had a call with the recruiter after, he was insanely apologetic.  I told him to put a note down that any other candidate going through these interviews should basically be an SWE.  My way of giving the next person a massive heads up.\n\nI had to do double takes and re-read the job descriptions. Amazingly, the job descriptions all involved: IaC, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Observability, Scaling Systems, Reliability engineering... you know.. Devops stuff.  \n\nI wonder - is this becoming the norm now? Are the skills I have just misaligned and not really DevOps? Interviews like this make me feel like a fraud, tbh.  It's like all the experience I have building infrastructure, scaling systems, writing operators, hammering away at terraform means nothing to these companies.  They just want a SWE that does infra.\n\n",

You get a few simple tasks tackling different areas (cli tooling, ansible, terraform, docker, troubleshooting, etc). You are given unlimited resources, including ChatGPT. You are doing it all ssh'd into a VM. You just have to share your screen while you do it. I generally know if someone is going to do well in the first 30 seconds. \n\nThe methods are intentionally left wide open. If you want to write Python to pull some fields out of a json api, that's fine. If you want to curl | jq, that's also fine. The test is designed to replicate tasks that you would normally do in the creation and maintenance of infrastructure. It is also designed to cause you headaches if you don't know tooling or can't do a simple google search. \n\nThe test is about how you approach a problem and can you quickly acquire the knowledge to solve it if you don't already possess it. How you reference docs, how you google search, how you prompt LLMs reveals just about all I need to know about you. It is wild to me how many people assume the shape of data and never once actually look at it. \n\nActual senior engineers plow through my interview in under 20 minutes. Less senior, but competent will usually finish in the allotted hour. People that have no idea what they are doing, usually try to grep json, unformatted, and get stuck for 30 minutes completing a two minute task.",

When something changes, the safest option becomes another meeting to rebuild context.\n\nTeams that invest in structured documentation (clear process ownership, decision logs, ADRs tied to actual systems) tend to reduce this overhead.

Replace ~~code~~ edit:docs with working code whenever possible. Deduplicate documentation as vigorously as you do your code. Hyperlink aggressively. Basically, systematically remove documentation that has the potential to rot.\n\nAs a really simple example, I like to replace \"getting started\" docs with a makefile. A makefile can be relatively high level, so it can somewhat serve as documentation. More importantly though, if the makefile (read: documentation) is wrong, it breaks and needs to get fixed. If it were regular documentation and it would break (i.e. be incorrect), then it really *doesn't* force you to fix it. So it often goes unfixed.",

The ones that get tested during incident response stay accurate. The ones that only get opened during onboarding rot because nobody feels the pain of them being wrong until the new hire is already confused.\n\nThe \"as little as possible\" point is underrated too.

It's like \"Ansible, for people\" - you build a plan, turn it into an executable runbook and track progress on a real-time dashboard as the work actually happens.

Multiple long-lived branches are being more and more considered an anti-pattern these days.\n\nYou need an immutable commit ref from which you can build a release candidate. With a single branch it's easy. Every commit merged into the mainline branch is built and stored as an artefact. Then when it's time to release, you take the commit you want to release, give it some reference (usually either a tag or a short-lived release branch) and your CD pipeline will promote that artefact through your environments. With multiple environment branches like how you've described it's much harder, because they're being merged into each other all the time and it's impossible to know which of those merge commits you need to be building as the release candidate.",

Some rules I just find to be pedantic and not helpful, so bring this up with your team and tweak it. \n\nSome checks, like autoformatters, I have run automatically as a pre-commit hook. That approach only works if the tool is very fast though (I use ruff which can lint and format my entire python repo in 2 seconds). This has helped me with the annoying feedback loop of committing, waiting 5 minutes, everything is green except the formatter, then needing to wait for everything again. \n\nYou mentioned having Snyk as a CI check, which stood out to me. Does this only check new dependencies you added in that PR, or check for vulnerabilities in existing packages? I could imagine a frustrating situation where some CVE comes out on an existing package, and then you can’t merge an emergency fix for a prod issue because you now need to also update the dependencies.\n\nPersonally I prefer using Snyk asynchronously. I set up a GitHub Actions cron to run “Snyk monitor” on the repo every night at 2am. We get weekly emails from Snyk with updates about any new vulnerabilities.",

In reality though, no package manager means rewriting every Dockerfile from scratch or maintaining dual images like some amateur hour setup.\n\nDid my homework and found countless teams hitting the same brick wall. Pipelines that worked fine suddenly break because you cant install debugging tools, cant troubleshoot in production, cant do basic system tasks without a shell.\n\nThe problem is security team wants minimal images with no vulnerabilities but dev team needs to actually ship features without spending half their time babysitting Docker builds. We tried multi-stage builds where you use Ubuntu or Alpine for the build stage then copy to distroless for runtime but now our CI/CD takes forever and we rebuild constantly when base images update.\n\nAlso nobody talks about what happens when you need to actually debug something in prod. You cant exec into a distroless container and poke around. You cant install tools. You basically have to maintain a whole separate debug image just to troubleshoot.\n\nHow are you all actually solving this without it becoming a full-time job? Whats the workflow for keeping familiar build tools (apt, apk, curl, whatever) while still shipping lean secure runtime images? Is there tooling that helps manage this mess or is everyone just accepting the pain?\n\nRunning on AWS ECS. Security keeps flagging CVEs in our Ubuntu-based images but switching to distroless feels like trading one problem for ten others.\n\n",

I would say that, for the orgs I work with, both the answers here are the best answers:\n\n1. Ensure that you have usable telemetry that reduces your need to interactively troubleshoot.  \n\n2. Build out a pattern using \\`kubectl debug\\` and an image built with all the tools you might need to debug so that you're ready when a team can't figure it out from their telemetry.\n\nSaying that you should have such amazing telemetry that you never have to interactively debug is a great philosophical position; however, my sense is that most orgs will never justify the levels of overhead and storage that might be necessary to do that SO OVERWHELMINGLY that they'll never need to break glass and debug interactively.  Better to have the pattern available, not need it, and eventually deprecate it than to need it and not have it.\n\nThere's also, always:\n\n3. Just ram \\`bash\\` and other basic tools in your distroless image.\n\nI \\_don't\\_ advocate this but, sometimes, the politics of the situation are that getting teams to give up the ability to \\`kubectl exec\\` in is, sometimes, too big a reach to start with.

During an incident, having logs + metrics + traces in one pane with zero config is genuinely faster than jumping between Grafana, Loki, and Tempo dashboards. The problem: we hit ~$8k/mo and it kept climbing with every new service.\n\nPrometheus + Grafana + Loki works great if you have a platform team to maintain it. We didn't -- Thanos for HA alone ate a week of eng time every quarter. And the point about locking yourself out of logs during an outage (mentioned above) is real. We learned that the hard way.\n\nThe middle ground is where it gets interesting now. Grafana Cloud gives you managed Prometheus without the ops burden. SigNoz and OneUptime are solid open-source options if you want to self-host but don't want to glue together 4 different systems. OneUptime specifically bundles monitoring + logs + on-call + status pages, which helped us also kill our PagerDuty and Statuspage bills.\n\nMy advice: if your team is < 5 eng, the operational overhead of DIY Prometheus will eat you alive. Either go managed (Grafana Cloud) or pick something unified. If you have a dedicated platform team, Prometheus + Grafana is hard to beat on flexibility.",

Everything is correlated and onboarding new engineers is easier. But at scale the billing model and cardinality can start shaping how you instrument things.\n\nLately I’ve also seen teams look at newer approaches like Groundcover, which keeps the Prometheus compatibility but tries to simplify the stack and correlation side without stitching five tools together. Some are also experimenting with Grafana Cloud as a middle ground.\n\nIn the end it feels less like feature comparison and more about how much operational ownership you want versus how much abstraction you’re comfortable with.",

The decision really comes down to: **Do you value control or convenience?**\n\n**Prometheus → Datadog reasons:**\n- **Alert fatigue** - Prometheus alerting config is YAML hell. Datadog's UI makes complex alert logic (multiple conditions, anomaly detection, forecast alerts) way easier.\n- **Unified observability** - Having metrics + logs + traces in one platform simplifies correlation. With Prometheus you're stitching together 3-4 tools (Prom + Loki + Jaeger/Tempo).\n- **Managed infrastructure** - Not dealing with Prometheus HA, TSDB sizing, retention management. This matters more as you scale.\n- **Query language** - PromQL is powerful but cryptic. Datadog's query builder + saved views are more accessible for non-SRE teams.\n\n**Datadog → Prometheus reasons:**\n- **Cost explosion** - Datadog pricing scales brutally with custom metrics and log volume. We hit k/month and realized 70% was log ingest we didn't need.\n- **Vendor lock-in** - Moving off Datadog is painful (all dashboards/alerts need rebuilding). Prometheus + Grafana is portable.\n- **Control** - Prometheus + long-term storage (Thanos/Cortex/Mimir) gives you full data ownership and infinite retention if needed.\n- **Cardinality limits** - Datadog has strict limits on tag cardinality. Prometheus handles high-cardinality metrics better (until you hit storage issues).\n\nHybrid approach we ended up with: Prometheus for metrics (self-hosted with Mimir for long-term storage), Datadog for logs and APM only. Gets us cost control on metrics while keeping the log/trace convenience.",

          "text": "Most interviewers will dig deepest into whatever technology stack their team actually uses day-to-day, but across the board, you need rock-solid fundamentals in Linux/systems administration and CI/CD pipelines. The reality is that most DevOps interviews test whether you can troubleshoot production issues and automate repetitive tasks - that means knowing how to debug failed deployments, read logs, understand networking basics, and write scripts that actually work. Containers and Kubernetes come up constantly now, so you should know more than just \"docker run\" - understand how networking works between containers, how resource limits affect performance, and what happens when things break. The cloud platform specifics matter less than understanding core concepts like IAM, networking, and managed services, since those patterns repeat across AWS, Azure, and GCP.\n\nThe biggest mistake candidates make is memorizing tool names and buzzwords but falling apart when asked to solve real problems or explain their reasoning. Interviewers can smell it immediately when someone claims expertise but can't explain why they'd choose one approach over another or how they'd debug a specific failure scenario. Be ready to walk through actual situations from your experience - even if they're from side projects or labs - and explain your thought process out loud. If you want practice getting real-time feedback on how you're explaining things, I built [interviews.chat](http://interviews.chat) which can help you work through technical questions in a conversational way before the actual interview.",

The challenge is: this is all very expensive and to get good outcomes you need a lot of investment in data infrastructure and you have to build the pipes any way between agents and their tooling. Which costs money and potentially far more than companies are willing to spend when the current view of AI is that it will solve everything with no effort besides paying for tokens.\n\nSo uhm definitely not replacing: depending on cost it will change things (cost of AI usage becoming the “how much”) also: SaaS … I’ve seen articles with this headline and it has me scratching my head: why would all SaaS fall under the AI bubble?
