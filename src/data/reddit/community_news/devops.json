      "text": "For years, my career was purely focused on on-prem infrastructure, mainly in Linux-based roles. I spent my days configuring OSs with Ansible and deploying them with Terraform using on-prem providers like vSphere and Proxmox. We hosted everything ourselves, and I really loved the feeling of actually *owning* those workloads.\n\nA few months ago, I took a new job at a company that helps migrate workloads to the Big 3 cloud providers... and I kind of hate it.\n\nI’m the type of person who likes to own my things in my personal life, and I’m realizing that applies to my professional life, too. On top of that, my current employer is heavily invested in a the well known Office suite ecosystem, which just doesn't align with my values—especially as an EU citizen paying attention to the current geopolitical climate.\n\nI know the obvious advice is *\"just switch jobs,\"* and I am actively looking. But it's tough when \"the cloud\" is practically a mandatory requirement on every job posting these days. I read this [blog post](https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-we-re-leaving-the-cloud-654b47e0) which is already 3 years old that give me hope for the future of on-prem\n\nI understand the business value of the cloud, but from a technical and ethical standpoint, my heart is still with on-prem. Has anyone else felt this way?",

In the cloud, it can feel like you’re just stitching together managed services and hoping the billing dashboard doesn’t explode.\n\nThat said, the market reality is what it is. Cloud isn’t going away but neither is on-prem. It’s just shifting. Regulated industries, edge workloads, hybrid setups, sovereignty concerns (especially in the EU), those are very real drivers for keeping things close to home.",

It’s like when something breaks, you actually get to fix it instead of filing a ticket and waiting for some faceless support team to give you a generic answer. I am also tired of everything being a subscription and feeling like I’m constantly renting my own work. The irony is the cloud was supposed to save everyone time and money but for some people and companies, it’s probably just adding more headaches. Not saying cloud is all bad, but it’s not this magic solution to everything. I do hope there’s more of a balance in the future. It would be good to see more jobs appreciate those old-school skills again. ",

If anything (ignoring the AI insanity) larger scale data centers that can be put in more sane places and consolidating servers will generally be better environmentally. Maybe job-wise there is also some consolidation as they will spread more part time employees to maintaining things, but I think that evens out when there are still admins required to run things for the business (SaaS excluded of course, but how much time did you spend \"running\" Exchange/Other mail servers). So yeah I think you just have some internal hiccup about this that you might want to just get over.\n\nI do kind of get it in one way, you've done thing in a particular way and you feel that was successful ... but being unable to transfer that success with something that in most aspects is the same as what you were doing already: is a real problem in the long run.

Having said that, our cloud operating costs are staggering and so we have to operate in a hybrid environment. Which just makes the differences more glaring. When you have to update the launch scripts for 100,000 on prem instances divided between bare metal, VMware, etc., it really makes you appreciate the ease of working with a cloud provider.

They do different things and it's okay to enjoy one more than the other. A hybrid approach tends to be my favorite unsurprisingly.\n\nThe thing is, this is a regular cycle in systems. We had mainframes and thin clients when hardware was more expensive and interconnects were fast enough, then we got fat clients and thinner servers doing coordination. Then it shifted back and so on and so forth. Cloud is the ultimate fat server, thin client methodology as it finally breaks it down to an api-first philosophy and allows you to start considering how expensive and reasonable is it to host it yourself.\n\nIf it helps, I find heavy IaC development helps me scratch my on-prem itch a bit. It's not the same, but a broad, flexible, well-ordered infra code stack you understand how to wrangle, improve, and update gets into a lot of the same brain nooks and crannies that understanding all the hardware does. If you can, leveraging more cloud-agnostic tools or understanding how to migrate between them not only gives you more control in general but also lets you KNOW how it all works in a similar way to racking your own boxes.\n\nIn my heart, I'll always prefer building my own cloud, letting me own the whole ecosystem, but finding ways to embrace the environment you find yourself in is essential to both survival and happiness. It's okay to have a preference, and hopefully your cloud work will help you focus WHY you prefer on-prem in a way that helps you leverage it. Best of luck",

You should be on the cloud. On-prem tends to work for really small companies, really massive enterprises, and poorly in between I've found. If your bills are too high, contact your rep and start asking about discounts. On AWS however this'll require you to pay for support.\n\nCloud was attractive because interest rates were basically 0% and borrowing money was free.

We're constantly removing dozens of posts a day, but some will slip through. This is where we need your help to report these posts. It's much easier to remove and ban those abusive users in a reported post, because reported posts get flagged for reviews.\n3. I plan on creating a mod application because we need more mods spread across different timezones. r/devops is consistently top 10 tech subs in terms of daily traffic so additional help will be needed.\n4. Whenever you see someone posting a \"discussion\" that is clearly an advertisement, report it and/or ping me/us directly. I'd like to start being a bit more heavy handed with permabans to discourage this sort of behavior.",

Software he's used, frameworks, programming languages, security and compliance regulations, standards, etc. There was not much about how he worked with those things, what he did with them, which bits he was more familiar with and less familiar with.\n\nI tried to get an idea about what kind of techie he is. Did he learn these things on his own? Or is he driven more by learning things as needed for the job? Has he designed anything on his own? Is he lawful good or chaotic neutral or...? Etc.\n\nThe answers I got made it feel like most of what he's done is work where someone else directed him, he coordinated with other teams, used vendor tools with pre-determined actions, ran scripts, etc. This is okay, since this wasn't for a senior role. But it made me think about how important it is, as a job seeker, to give a potential employer an idea of what kind of work you do. It's not just about checking boxes or flexing on hard skills, but showing that you're a person as well. Especially since these days everyone's on the lookout for AI chatbot answers. In this case, maybe he was just nervous. Maybe he's not good in formal situations. Or maybe he's just \"not a good fit\", as they say.",

Understanding how my brain works with ASD and ADHD (I got me a bit of both) has helped me immensely. But with someone like me you often can’t imply a request in an unfamiliar setting and expect me to get nuance. \n\nSo for example in an interview you might ask “tell me about the first time you worked on increasing observability of your environment.”\n\nAnd they will tell you they worked with a senior engineer implementing specific monitoring in prometheus and adding them to graphana based on previous frameworks. \n\nBut maybe you wanted to see how they learned graphana and prometheus. Or how they learned new things in general and that’s why you said “the first time…”\n\nToo subtle. I’m expecting that question, hell I wrote the question in this hypothetical scenario, and my autistic ass would still fucking miss it. \n\nBe direct. “How do you learn new tooling or new skills?”\n\nAnswer: If it’s really really new and I literally don’t know what I don’t know I’ll ask people familiar with the tech for good resources. Then it’s blogs, forums, how-to’s, and YouTube but I’m a real hands on learner so it’s not entirely mine until I get it working somewhere. \n\n\n================\n\nI know I just made some wild assumptions based on not a lot of information, but I’ve absolutely been the applicant in this interview in my life and had literally no idea why I wasn’t getting jobs. \n\nJust something to consider in the way you word your interviews. There are tons of neurospicy folk in tech we’re not dumb (mostly…. I’m kinda dumb sometimes) and maybe you did ask direct questions and you still didn’t get what you were looking for (in which case, bad fit, sure. It happens.)\n\nJust sharing my lived experience as both an interviewee and interviewer.",

Output per employee goes up. The board is happy.\n\nThen production reality starts to show up.\n\nKlarna is the clearest example. Their AI assistant handled the workload of hundreds of support agents and they reduced staff aggressively. The financial metrics improved and revenue per employee went very high.\n\nBut the customer experience dropped. Engineers had to step into support. They started bringing humans back.\n\nSo AI did not fail. The strategy failed. They used AI as a replacement instead of as leverage.\n\nYou can see the same pattern in the McDonald’s AI drive thru pilot. The issue was not that the technology exists. The issue was accuracy in a real environment with real customers. The human fallback had been removed too early.\n\nFiverr also moved to an AI first model and cut a large part of the workforce. What followed was not a pure cost saving story. It became a restructuring into new roles built around AI.\n\nNow look at the companies where the numbers are actually strong.\n\nIBM automated large parts of internal operations and then hired more engineers.\n\nSalesforce increased support capacity and moved people to higher value work.\n\nIn those cases AI increased output per person. It did not remove the need for experienced people.\n\nThis is starting to show up in DevOps and platform teams.\n\nThere is a growing belief in some organisations that AI can run infrastructure, manage incidents, write pipelines and remove the need for senior engineers.\n\nIt can help with log analysis. It can help generate Terraform. It can summarise alerts. It can produce a first version of a runbook.\n\nBut in a real incident you still need someone who understands the system, the business impact and the trade offs. You still need coordination across teams. You still need accountability.\n\nThat part has not changed.\n\nThe companies getting real value from AI are using it to remove toil and to make good engineers faster and more effective.\n\nThe companies cutting teams because they think AI replaces experience are saving money for a few quarters and then rebuilding the same capability under pressure.\n\nCurious what others are seeing.\n\nIs AI in your organisation increasing the impact of the platform team or being used as a reason to reduce it?",

It just doesn't have the knowledge other than some newb posting on Stack Overflow or Medium like 10 years ago.\n\nIt's broken so much stuff and they've been told to only use it for Bash, Python, AWS CLI etc and definitely not for an API for a vendor we use unless they're super huge like Google or similar.  Python is still questionable.  v2 vs v3 and it mixes things up so much unless you give it existing code to review.  \n\nRecently one of my guys completely f**ked a database because they trusted what it said about Percona Tools.  *sigh*",

Are you planning to focus on AWS, Azure, or GCP?\n\nAfter choosing one, I’d prioritize core services like compute, storage, IAM, and networking, then move into Infrastructure as Code with Terraform. Pair that with basic CI/CD and Docker so you understand how apps get deployed in the cloud. You don’t need advanced Kubernetes yet, but understanding containers is important.

We had good practices too but the gap showed up when we had to explain them consistently.\n\nThe biggest friction for us wasn’t technical controls, twas ownership and cadence. Who owns each risk? When is it reviewed? What triggers an update? We were doing them, just not in a way that was easy to trace back six months later.\n\nIf I could go back I’d tighten three things early.\n\nFirst of all. Make risk ownership explicit and documented.\n\nSecond of all. Define review cadence and actually calendar it.\n\nLast but not least. Centralize where those decisions live so they don’t drift across slack and email.  \n  \nWe ended up tracking risk reviews and ownership in Delve so the reasoning behind decisions didn’t get lost between audits.

It’s a wide spectrum of concepts, technologies and more. It’s a methodology and a philosophy more than anything and any given day depending on the company you could be doing dozens of different things. If that sounds like it’s your ball game then it would before, but not every day is glamorous. Some days you’re doing cutting edge, other days you’re managing a 30 year old server some random exec needs data from for some reason that’s got no documentation or whatever.

      "text": "Hi all,\n\nI am working full-remote as DevOps which in our comapny means AllOps\n\nBackground: \nI started as an intern developer in another company 4 years ago. Worked as an intern (part-time) for a year and half on internal projects and wrote automated tests, setting up self-hosted runners for running the tests etc. - my netto was pretty modest as a part-time intern. After I graduated, I got full time offer from them as QA Automation engineer - got payed double, but still modest. I did that for about 6 months, and they offered me DevOps role. I trained for a month, then I was given tasks to manage cluster of Hetzner nodes running Docker Swarm applications, setting up CI/CD and managing small K8s cluster.\n\nAfter 6 months in that role, I was offered a DevOps Engineer role in my current company. I accepted the job mostly because of the experience I would earn, which proved to be the right decision. I was their first DevOps, and had to write Terraform for all of their resources on AWS, provision EKS for multi-environment, zero downtime, multi AZ, set up self-hosted tools, optimize their CI/CDs and all of that nice stuff. I reduced their monthly infrastructure cost for about 25%. Fast forward to today, after year and a half I am doing EVERYTHING - managing databases, handling multiple different EKS, self-hosted monitoring and logging stack, doing their FinOps (constructing reports, deciding on Savings Plans, RI etc.), managing their Google Workspace (setting up users, emails for multiple domains, MX, DKIM, etc.). Everything that is not developing the application and testing it - is somehow my responsibility. In addition to this, I am leading another DevOps Engineer who joined recently and isn't really confident about touching anything production related. \nAlso, I am often expected to be available outside my working hours when something goes down. I jump in because I take ownership in what I build but this isn't part of my contract and I feel like I shouldn't be doing this.\n\nThe salary didn't quite keep up with my workload. I got one raise of 20%. Another one of 10% and that's where I currently am.\nI gained a lot of experience and I feel confident about everything I do, but I feel like I am very underpaid (even for my location) for the amount of work I do.\n\nWhat would you do in my position? Should I start rejecting the work I am not supposed to do? Should I ask for significant salary increase or is the only way to switch the job?",

I've had to add manual clean up steps to my jobs for things that were automatically removed by GitLab.\n\n* Neither way's necessarily better, inherently, but GitHub's opt-in approach to doing a repo checkout took some getting used to.

However, with Jenkins we had established a common pipeline design that could be largely reused across all our repositories. The basic structure of the Jenkinsfile looked very familiar everywhere, had similar stages and logic, and it just invoked a bash script that handled the Docker build internally. The script had very similar structure in all repos and it was also easily runnable locally.\n\nGithub Actions forces you to use their Docker build action. Therefore, we had to re-implement all pipelines from scratch and we lost the ability to directly reproduce the Docker builds locally. Worst of all, the pipelines are now completely different between repositories, making it more difficult to understand for everybody.\n\nWe were also using the Actions Runner Controller for self-hosting the runners on our k8s cluster. That thing was absolutely impossible to debug. The autoscaler was extremely slow to respond to demand. We frequently hit the situation where dozens of jobs were waiting to be picked up, yet the ARC was seemingly doing nothing and the k8s cluster was sitting idle with plenty of available resources to run those jobs.",

(in the repo)  \n\\- Are there any better DevOps skills to learn or is there anything that I'm lacking at the moment?\n\nSince most of the jobs I've seen heavily rely on Azure, that's why it's so heavily favored in the roadmap.\n\nThank you in advance for any input.

So depending on what you're applying to Jr vs non-jr I'm going to view your resume differently. \n\nIf you're applying for a Sr position, I more than likely won't care about your lab. You're a senior. It's like comparing the tree house you built in your backyard to standing up a building on the main street. I want to know what you've actually done in an environment where you don't have the luxury of time that you get with a home lab in a pristine environment where it's only you making changes.  That makes the assumption your lab has things we use. For example bragging about running K8s on your resume. That's great but we use ECS (not EKS or K8s) so pumping that lab up doesn't really tell me much especially when I've never ran k8s myself nor been in a position to run it. \n\nIf you are applying for a Jr position, I want to see a documented history of you doing at least sysadmin level work. Can you build out a server? Can you secure it? Can you configure apache/ngnix/iis? What have you automated in your workplace? What scripting languages do you know and what real world business situation did you fix with your script? Do you know how to interface with an API, take the results, and pass it to another API to glue two things that normally don't speak to each other? etc This stage your assists in helping me keep my questions at the level that makes sense for asking.",

It's backed by actual research (the DORA metrics) and gives you a solid framework for thinking about deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate. Way more useful than any tool-specific tutorial.\n\nFor incident management, the Google SRE book is free online and the chapters on error budgets and postmortems are gold. Also check out \"The Phoenix Project\" if you haven't, it reads like a novel but the principles stick.\n\nOne thing I wish someone told me earlier: these concepts aren't separate buckets. Automation philosophy feeds directly into deployment strategies, which feeds into incident response. Start with CI/CD fundamentals and everything else starts clicking into place.",

There's also the option of working high frequency trading companies where stress levels are high but so is the pay.. \n\nWhats the equivalent for DevOps? \n\nDo companies like AWS pay their in-house DevOps engineers a lot?

It introduces normalized patterns of infra, security, stability, observability, tooling etc.  That doesn't mean it always works, I've seen some awful platform teams, especially when they treat their dev teams as an obstacle rather than a partner.\n\nFor smaller organizations, I lean the other way.  I feel like it adds a lot of unnecessary expense and overhead.  If folks insist on it, I usually recommend spending money on commercial platform products instead.",

Platform Engineers often maintain platform and cloud infrastructure.\n\nA Cloud Engineer and SRE sits on the operations side. Cloud Engineering has taken over pretty much all the responsibilities of a DevOps Engineer that often handles the CI/CD pipelines and cloud infrastructure.

          "text": "I’ve run a few cloud platform engineering teams, mostly focused on AWS with a bit of Azure, so I’ll use that language. Others will have very different takes I’m sure. The teams and platforms I’ve built are for very large organizations with 100s or 1000s of very different applications, security needs, engineering approaches, and funding.\n\nAt the very basic level 0 is providing an environment where teams can build their applications. In AWS this is an account, a VPC, and basic networking to get started. This will tie into on prem and into central ingress/egress stacks. Access to the environment should tie in with the enterprise authentication and authorization system like AD/Entra. It will also include basic guardrails like no public S3 buckets, which services are allowed to be be used, and basic logging into the enterprise SIEM/SOAR. Finally, FinOps, which is pretty straightforward at this level since everything deployed by you into your account is your responsibility. \n\nThen we start getting into the à la carte stuff. The first thing is usually gold images for popular or enterprise OS’. They will contain all security agents, licensing, logging configurations, monitoring, domain join, etc. needed to work right out of the box. The goal is the application team shouldn’t need to do anything other than building an EC2 from your AMI. The app teams put its application specific needs on to top that. Ideally app teams are redeploying every month or so with the latest secure AMI. It could also include patching capabilities for those teams that are just getting started in cloud.\n\nThe next piece is a pre hardened container based on enterprise requirements. Again, the goal is the same: let app teams focus on the application requirements, not infrastructure.\n\nNext to this might be configurations for RDS (Postgres, MySQL, etc.) This could be delivered a few ways such as parameter configurations for database available in git, all the way to preconfigured instances in AWS service catalog, or anything in between such as parameter sharing via RAM. \n\nThe last and final level I’ve done is providing configured ECS, fargate, or other container platforms. This gets complicated quickly and I am not a container expert so I lean heavily on my engineer experts for input, advice, and ideas. \n\nAll of this is delivered as IaC with pipelines specifically for each need (account creation & configuration, Windows AMI, docker container build, etc.)\n\nThat’s platform engineering to me",

You build the app, you post a guide as to how to use the app, you keep the app running, but ideally you don't lift a finger when another team starts using the app.\n\nFundamentally, an Ops team is a service team: dev team says \"hey, here's my code\" and the Ops team sets up a running instance of it in production.\n\nFundamentally, a DevOps team is, ideally, a platform team: dev team says \"hey, my code's ready to go to production\" and they say \"here's the guide on how to deploy your stuff to prod, holler if you have any questions\".\n\nI have observed some teams attempting to transition from Ops to DevOps and struggling with the fact that if you are building a platform, your job is to COMMUNICATE WITH and SUPPORT the teams using your stuff.  Because nobody can use the platform if they don't know it exists, and nobody will keep using the platform if you break their implementations on top of it ever two months without any warning.",

(warning: long but also a filter) \n\nIs there something so broken you need to change?\nOr are you afraid of your own resume for the next job?\nWhy gitops, if git is a mystery to some. Why k8s when containers are a supernova to them.. Etc.. \n\nNow that i got your attention... \n\n1. Every single person needs to know the tool. No single point of dependency/failure or as we like to call it 'there is always a bus..'.\n\n2. Every single person needs to know the eco system and lifecycle of the tool, follow change logs, blogs, youtube videos, new version releases, even create internal docs, maybe even contributing if its oss. Understand security risks and good practices. \n\n3. Everything is done with devops practices (bonus if you use CALMS framework, use these as okrs and youll see a change) \n\n4. No tool lives in a silo. Your team works with another team that uses other tools, so your choices have to be taken with a bigger perspective, not personal one. Their choices will affect you as much as yours affects them, especially the lower your team in the stack. \n\nSo how do we do it? \n\nTraining and knowledge sharing. Patience and time. \nCurrent employer is heavy windows and azure. \nI would love to teach them golang and make all of our cli tools basically tui. They 'know' powershell. \nSo powershell it is. Do i fear about my golang knowledge? Not that much, i create here and there tools for my own home usage, read, watch , ask. You understand structures of one language, you understand most of them. I try and contribute in projects that intrest me.\n\n I CHOOSE to accept the job, knowing what at stake. But alao because i know how ro make the team work and grow from inside.. Not like a external trainer tellng them 'youre doing it wrong' but giving them examples and tools for them to make the change. Be always available to them. My focus is using the team power and elevate it, +1 at a time. \n\nSo we then focus of them gathering scripts and i share knowledge about modules, rest apis, repositories pipelines, pester for unit test, azure cli and azure powershell. Terraform was not needed, as much as im a promoter of it, not everything has to have terraform. \n\nThey MUST feel that they dont lose control over their domain. They MUST be active participants. I had an elderly guy in a young team that wasnt comfortable with material so i had one on one with him, added him to debug sessions, increase confidence. We dont leave peeps behind. They MUST be the Owners. When they creata scrip that does in 2 min, a task that took a week they get empowered, because THEY creared it..?not me. \nThey have to feel psychological safety to speak and even rant.\n\nI remember a 30 man dev team from india that i supported and had knowledge sharing sessions and they would be very very quiet and rarely engaged, until ive figured they were afraid to speak as their lead/veteran dev was there so didnt want their 'stupid questions' to slow me or others as it might impact their promotions. After rhar, we had separafe sessions that the leads were not allwed in and i had sessions with the leads only. You have to know your audience and adapt accordingly.\nIve always said devops is not just people first, its human psychology first, interactions, communication. \nI remeber promoting an intern with 0 devops experience as she had masters in communication and a sharp learner, when I requested her to prepare a short knowledge sharing session about a database engine we were pondering on using for ourselves, she aced it, as if she had 10 yrs of experience with it. I can train and teach and share every language and everytool tool and every practice. How to communicate, having empathy and some EQ is very hard to teach. \n\nThen we go forward and teams offer their services to other teams. They agree on exchange. If other team knows powershell, great team a publishes a module, other team uses it, after team a created proper docs. Other team doesnt know powershell and want api, team a offers an api based on the powerahell code they have and support. Basically adopting a product mindset. \n\nI had an org with silo teams for almost everything and one day we had a request to create a solution that required service now form, tew entra groups, a storage, a dfs share on the storage and applying ntfs permission on share. Each diff team. Each got training sessions on modules, each created their own. The platform team combined all to solution. One of the teams worked with python so they created a fastapi endpoint and the process called them.\n\nHuge emphasis on rest api as means to collaborate in cases of multiple tools and responsibilities and yes pwsh has a great rest api module called pode that i highly recommend. \n\nAll the teams had a pipeline, all teams had basic unit testing using pester, all teams used pull requests for new features. \nAll teams were the ownwrs of their domain. To a level that the service now form read json files from the team repo when they wanted to change content of list box without having to wait for weeks for servicenow people to change a form. \n\nOne of the teams even came to me one day saying they found a module that could save some of the time, another came to me saying a new version of az cli came with a new feature. Thats an engaged team that feels empowered to create and maintain a service and even be proud of their work.\n\nI cant emphsize enough how knowledge sharing is vital (that is the S in CALMS) and how humbleness is essential. I was lucky to have the training along my career to now share it with others so they become better, because when they do, i become better. Not to mention as someday i will retire and we all want to leave this place slightly better that we got it, no? :) \n\nDoes it fit everyone, nope. There will be failures. Thats why transformation takes time. (min 3yrs, faster with ai). Sit with the team, create a plan, let them lead the discussion. Listen and then listen some more. Ask questions, dont be afraid to show that you dont know everything or has answers to everything but that you are going to put the hours and effort and even fail, the outcome will be one of your career achivements and the impact you will have on their career and eventually yours. \n\nSorry for the length :)",

Terraform thinks in desired state. That gap trips people up more than the syntax.\n\nWhat worked for us: don't try to migrate everything at once. Run both in parallel. Let Terraform handle net-new infra and keep Ansible for config management where it's already working. People get less defensive when you're not ripping out their stuff.\n\nThe cookiecutter template idea is good tbh. We did something similar — a wrapper that asked like 5 questions and spit out a working module. Adoption went from \"nobody touches it\" to \"oh that's actually faster\" in maybe 3 weeks. The trick was making the first experience stupidly easy, not technically impressive.\n\nOne thing I'd skip: don't lead with \"gitops\" or \"state management\" in your pitch. Nobody who's happy with Ansible cares about those words yet. Lead with \"you can spin up a full environment in 2 minutes and tear it down when you're done.\" That's the part that clicks.",

Say you work at a company with a few different development teams and an infrastructure/platform/devops team. Each team has 3, 4 maybe 5 devs. How are you in that scenario having devs working with agents writing code and deploying it into prod successfully in the same codebase? How is that going to work in a monorepo? How would it work with poly-repo and dependencies between?\n\nI’ve worked with AI in the way the article describes on helper scripts, bootstrapping, and solo stuff. It’s great. I’ve also tried to work with it in a corporate environment with others and all that happens is you push a shit ton of code and then have to refactor and get everyone else to rebase and sort out dependencies and promote changes to test environments and the list goes on. It’s anti-agile - where we were able to accomplish delivering small incremental things quickly. Now it’s like building on quicksand, everything is changing all the time. No amount of monitoring is enough.",
