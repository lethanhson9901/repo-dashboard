      "text": "I’ve been lurking here for years, and after reading some recent posts, I need to say something that might make me unpopular with the \"CV-Driven Development\" crowd.\n\n**We are engineering our own burnout.**\n\nI've sat on hiring panels for the last 6 months, and the state of \"Senior\" DevOps is terrifying. I’m seeing a generation of engineers who can write complex Helm charts but can’t explain how DNS propagation works or debugging a TCP handshake.\n\nHere is my analysis of why our industry is currently broken:\n\n**1. The Abstraction Addiction** We are solving problems we don't have. I saw a candidate last week propose a multi-cluster Kubernetes setup with Istio for a simple internal CRUD app. When I asked *why* not just use a boring EC2 instance or ECS task, they looked at me like I suggested using FTP. We are choosing tools not because they solve a business problem, but because we want to put them on our LinkedIn. We are voluntarily taking on the operational overhead of Netflix without having their scale or their headcount.\n\n**2. The Death of Debugging** To the user who posted \"New DevOps please learn networking\": **Thank you.** We are abstracting away the underlying systems so heavily that we are creating engineers who can \"configure\" but cannot \"fix.\" When the abstraction leaks (and it always does, usually at 3 AM), these \"YAML Engineers\" are helpless because they don't understand the Linux primitives underneath.\n\n**3. Hiring is a Carnival Game** We ask for 8 rounds of interviews to test for trivia on 15 different tools, but we don't test for **systems thinking**. Real seniority isn't knowing the flags for every CLI tool; it's knowing when *not* to use a tool. It's about telling management, \"No, we don't need to migrate to that shiny new thing.\"\n\n**4. Complexity = Job Security (False)** We tell ourselves that building complex systems makes us valuable. It doesn't. It makes us pagers. The best infrared engineers I know build systems so boring that they sleep through the night. If you are currently building a resume-padder architecture: **Stop.**  \n\n\n  \nIf you are a Junior: Stop trying to learn the entire CNCF landscape. Learn Linux. Learn Networking. Learn a scripting language deeply. If you are a Senior: Stop checking boxes. Start deleting code.  \n\n\nThe most senior thing you can do is build something so simple it looks like a junior did it, but it never goes down.\n\n/endrant",

The site was dreadfully slow, it went down all the time, was very complex (for example, staff had to manually set cookies in their browsers to get routed to the proper back-end via HAProxy or risk breaking things), and cost around $2,000/month in AWS. The site was actually quite basic with some modest traffic.\n\nI spun up a VPS from a provider that they already had an account for, set up a basic LAMP stack, did some rudimentary hardening, migrated the site to it, set up monitoring, and set up backups. All told, it took less than a day to do this. The site was way faster, was very stable, and was extremely simple for staff to use.\n\nThe owner asked me what I did. I explained that I just moved the site to a VPS and got rid of the complexity.\n\nOwner: \"How much will that cost us?\"\n\nMe: \"I dropped the monthly expenses from $2,000 to $20.\"\n\nOwner: \"Oh. You did some kind of optimization magic? Something special?\"\n\nMe: \"Nope. It's just a basic VPS with a LAMP stack on it.\"\n\nI don't think he ever believed me.",

It's a bit of overtrusting the promises tooling gives and kinda burying their heads in sand for everything else.\n\nWhat I've seen a lot, is from the devs I've done devops for, they will design 10 levels of abstraction for an incoming message for example, it will hit a first api to put in a queue, then it will go into a message bus and then it will be propagated to a second API which just stores it in a DB for use by a web app or sth. And I'm like \"ok what if we just put it in the DB directly at the start?\" \"no that's not gonna be scalable\"... Meanwhile our DB is on a 16 CPU server running at 2% usage for 99% of the day because we need it all everynight when an indexing worker runs and pulls the whole DB 16 times because no one wants to take a look at what queries their MVC framework will run.\n\nYea things are crazy out there.",

Worst case scenario your authentication request takes a little longer to complete but it still works. \n\nWe had a new data center get built, the engineer(s) standing it up configured radius incorrectly (locally) but it passed initial checks (it just failed over to a nearby location) so they didn’t dig any deeper (why would they, radius worked) ran like that for 7 years and was found not because something broke, but because we were replacing it. Now radius is like 9ms faster in that data center. \n\nIt has never broken in a way that monitoring didn’t pick up, or that required after hours intervention. (Aside from ack’ing an alert for a failed node and scribbling a note to fix that on Monday) it’s boring, it works, I barely know anything about it because it never breaks. I’ve read his docs, but I’m a hands on learner and I rarely if ever touch it. \n\nThat’s how I want all services to run.

Because those layers were abstracted in your time, just like networking is now abstracted by cloud providers and Kubernetes. Abstraction did not start yesterday.\n\nI agree that a good engineer needs a solid understanding of their environment. What I disagree with is throwing around random low-level facts like DNS propagation or TCP handshakes as a badge of honor. That is just blowing one’s own trumpet. By that logic, I could argue that everyone should deeply understand NFS small-packet overhead. I dealt with it in the past. Most people did not, and that is fine.\n\nNo single engineer can know everything. Teams work because knowledge is distributed. It is good to have someone strong in networking, someone else focused on Kubernetes and Prometheus, and others closer to application or business logic. Some engineers simply want to do their job well, get paid, and go home. That does not make them bad engineers.\n\nRegarding the constant rants about cloud, Kubernetes, and microservices (“I mOvEd A SErVicE To a TeApOt AnD mAkE iT 9TiMeS FaStEr”) those anecdotes say nothing about the technology itself. They only show that the previous system was poorly analyzed or badly designed for its actual requirements.\n\nThis growing neoluddism in our field is exhausting. The anti-cloud, anti-Kubernetes, anti-CNCF posture, where every modern tool is treated as stupid or pedantic, is itself shallow. Rejecting tools by default is no more mature than adopting them blindly.\n\nThat does not mean everything should run on Kubernetes, or that every system needs a service mesh. It means these tools and architectures exist for specific reasons and solve specific problems. As engineers, our responsibility is to understand what those problems are and when a tool fits — and when it clearly does not.",

They are so accustomed to using one thing or the other and paying out the nose that they forgot you can just do it in a simple manner and get better performance and -\\*gasp\\*- do brick layer backup. No need to redeploy for anything, we can wrench on it while it is running, no problem.\n\nOne day I will amaze them by showing them an entire cloud in one rack, what we used to call a 'mainframe'. One of my go-tos is to ask why their proposed architecture is any better than buying a mainframe. It isn't that I am actually going to ever buy a mainframe, unless I need the fastest processor to disk wiring available on the planet, I am probing whether they understand why they are doing what they are doing. \n\nFor the record, we are refactoring our main application to use things like kafka and even driven architecture, away from database SPROCs and EXE jobs. We have obvious and sound engineering reasons to do this. The physicals of our app (we use actual physical sensors and what not) are appropriate for an event driven architecture, something harder to do when we initially deployed the paradigm we are on in 2003. Hell, this paradigm will last another 22 years if we really want it too, but it is inflexible and lacks a durable control and monitoring layer. So it isn't like I am anti new technology, I am anti new technology from people who need resume fillers who don't know about anything else and assume us old heads are just stodgy old bastards who don't want to learn anything new.

          "text": "Totally agree with you here (and that’s rare for this sub). I interviewed with a company recently and I was pleasantly surprised that a lot of what you described as missing from senior engineering (this was staff level) was asked of me. I was not asked a single technical question about any specific AWS resource; instead, they focused on my problem solving, my ability to architect a solution for a problem, and importantly to your point, asking when I would want to use something more complicated vs less complicated and why. \n\nI didn’t prepare myself well for that since I was so used to people trying to trip me up on pedantic things they knew and memorized vs what I knew and memorized. \n\nOne of the first things I did at my current job (as lead) was to have a scenario-based learning session about DNS and how to troubleshoot. I agree that having people immediately starting in a cloud environment and sometimes their first job being in DevOps (how??) means they missed that physical resource experience many of us got in data centers or on-prem racks. They’re also starting off automating things sometimes believing it’s “magic” how some of us know things. As much as we try to teach that everything we all do started off with some manual deployment into a test environment, testing, and then automating once it’s understood, I think the pressure and expectations some junior engineers feel to be delivering at the same pace as senior engineers means they’re skipping these steps. They then depend on more senior engineers to do the debugging/learning for them via PRs, Slack, etc, much further along in the process. \n\nAnd the proliferation of AI (LLM), along with the lie many believe that this will be a near-future replacement for engineers, is a detriment to this. So many times I’ve seen hand-wavy changes that LLM did it and it worked so it’s the solution, when many times the requirements were not understood or the solution LLM came up with was not similar to what all the other engineers were used to or the patterns used across the team. \n\nMany challenges to overcome. But admitting we have problems and being critical of the current workflows is a great place to start",

We literally built the modern infrastructure incrementally out of necessity. We took the long way, we experimented, we made mistakes, we tried all the options, we have a wealth of knowledge about what works and what doesn't and what is efficient and what is not.\n\nReminds me of developers advocating for converting bash scripts to java a few decades ago - they took functionality that ran on 20mhz cpus with a few dozen lines of code and took almost no RAM and turned it into software that needed a Java VM that needed constant patching, upgrading, ... licensing..., and required 10x the CPU and ram resources (or more) and was a bloody mess to maintain compared to the original bash scripts.  ... and then some team declared victory once all the nasty bash scripts were replaced.\n\nYounger employees grew up in the era of \"just use Visual Studio code with autocomplete (and now AI) - no need to go deeper than you need\", \"just learn cloud provisioning APIs - no need to go deeper than you need\", \"just use terraform for everything - no need to get too deep into any cloud service\", \"just use docker containers - no need to understand what's in them\", \"just use kubernetes - no need to understand hardware\"\n\nThat is what they know.\n\nWhen all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\n\nWhen all you have is kubernetes, everything looks like a problem that kubernetes can solve.\n\nHaving said all of that, there's important context -- when all you have are people who use vs code, only code in typescript, and struggle to keep production services updated and secure -- there's a strategic advantage to building things using high level, simple, scriptable, repeatable, externally maintained pieces.  \n  \nand... it's progress, inevitable, and unavoidable - gone are the days when software is written in assembly for performance and speed because the humans involved in the software equation are the most expensive part - if it's 100x slower and takes 100x more hardware, that's still cheaper than requiring more human work. If it's 10x slower and CPU is cheap, it may not be worth the optimization.\n\nalso, one reaches a point where it's IMPOSSIBLE for any one human to understand modern tech - look at large, mature software products and see if you can count how many active developers actually KNOW the entire codebase - chances are it's few to none. Look at modern hardware design - nobody can simply 'design' a ciruit board and use off the shelf logic chips anymore - they're all multilayer boards with custom chips and everything is miniaturized. Hardware and circuit boards we used to be able to debug and repair are pretty much field replacable units that get junked when something goes wrong now.",

I am about 1 month way from 90 % backend testing , the likes. Similar in the frontend, we are ripping up many things and keep simplifying. Same with our architecture. Kubernetes survived, but the whole cluster thing got simplified to death also. I dont want to see anything near distributed transactions , cap theorem and saga patterns for the whole year. I even got myself out of interviews in my day job. Last one i did, I almost started yelling to my colleague when he started roasting the candidate about hexagonal architecture and choreography saga. FUCK THEM ALL. Business value, simplicity, and sleep at nights. I brought down my delivery cycle for new features to extreme times. Thats my innovation.

      "text": "    Hey ,\n    \n    \n    I built this thing called K8sQuest because I was tired of paying for cloud sandboxes and wanted to practice debugging broken clusters.\n    \n    \n    ## What it is\n    \n    \n    It's basically a game that intentionally breaks things in your local kind cluster and makes you fix them. 50 levels total, going from \"why is this pod crashing\" to \"here's 9 broken things in a production scenario, good luck.\"\n    \n    \n    Runs entirely on Docker Desktop with kind. No cloud costs.\n    \n    \n    ## How it works\n    \n    \n    1. Run `./play.sh` - game starts, breaks something in k8s\n    2. Open another terminal and debug with kubectl\n    3. Fix it however you want\n    4. Run `validate` in the game to check\n    5. Get a debrief explaining what was wrong and why\n    \n    \n    The game Has hints, progress tracking, and step-by-step guides if you get stuck.\n    \n    \n    ## What you'll debug\n    \n    \n    - World 1: CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff, pending pods, labels, ports\n    - World 2: Deployments, HPA, liveness/readiness probes, rollbacks\n    - World 3: Services, DNS, Ingress, NetworkPolicies\n    - World 4: PVs, PVCs, StatefulSets, ConfigMaps, Secrets  \n    - World 5: RBAC, SecurityContext, node scheduling, resource quotas\n    \n    \n    Level 50 is intentionally chaotic - multiple failures at once.\n    \n    \n    ## Install\n    \n    \n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/Manoj-engineer/k8squest.git\n    cd k8squest\n    ./install.sh\n    ./play.sh\n    ```\n    \n    \n    Needs: Docker Desktop, kubectl, kind, python3\n    \n    \n    ## Why I made this\n    \n    \n    Reading docs didn't really stick for me. I learn better when things are broken and I have to figure out why. This simulates the actual debugging you do in prod, but locally and with hints.\n    \n    \n    Also has safety guards so you can't accidentally nuke your whole cluster (learned that the hard way).\n    \n    \n    Feedback welcome. If it helps you learn, cool. If you find bugs or have ideas for more levels, let me know.\n    \n    \n    GitHub: https://github.com/Manoj-engineer/k8squest.git",

Originally, it was supposed to be about breaking down silos and shared responsibility, but in many places, it has just turned into a dumping ground for everything the dev team doesn't want to deal with.\n\nIf a deployment fails, it’s a DevOps problem. If the cloud bill is too high, it’s a DevOps problem. If a database is slow, call DevOps. We’ve gone from \"building platforms\" to just being the people who get paged at 3 AM because a script we didn't write failed in a way we couldn't predict. We are spending so much time putting out fires that we don't have the bandwidth to actually automate the systems that prevent them.\n\nI’ve been trying to document some better boundaries and automation patterns on OrbonCloud lately.\nAre we just stuck as the \"everything\" engineers now?",

The tools changed, some attitudes changed, and there was a net benefit in smoothing out some chaotic processes from experiments into convention, but at its core it was always about solving the problems involved in making your software work with the resources you had available.\n\nWhat you're seeing is the result of that experimentation slowing in regards to software delivery pipeline development, as various patterns have been tried and the most commonly accepted standards have coalesced.\n\nSpecific development roles are undergoing a new round of domain specialization with the ascent of AI tooling and the quirks they introduce. The focus on experimentation is shifting away from pipeline design to AI tooling efficiency and how to make use of it in testing, security, and observability.\n\nHence, if you were hired as a DevOps engineer, you'll now be saddled with not only making sure the development pipelines are working, but that the production systems they feed are operating and that the feedback loop (which we used to try to send to developers) is plugged into some AI-driven analysis toolset and delivering useful feedback.\n\n**tl;dr**: this was always what the job was, people just give it different names based on the technological zeitgeist",

Like Isaiah Berlin's old \"foxes and hedgehogs\" metaphor. When Kim and Humble packaged the DevOps role, they did a lot of work to carve out a lot of what amounted to generalists' responsibilities and line them up as specialties that could be fit together and served more efficiently overall by arranging them as a series of tightly integrated roles.\n\nNow that those arrangements are well-understood, it's become more useful (or rather, businesses are motivated to narrow their personnel) to have a \"specialist\" who can understand the whole system— and once again, generalize over it.\n\nTBF, I'm just restating myself all over again.

Took me a while to wrap my head around it.\n\nThe name basically originates from kubelet (a quadlet is a flattened kubelet) or if you squash a kube you get a quad. Thinking about it from the kubelet direction helped me grasping what red hat is trying to do.",

As a beginner, it feels overwhelming to remember so many commands and configurations. In real jobs, do engineers memorize most commands, or is it normal to rely on documentation, notes, and previously written scripts?\n\nAlso, how different is interview expectation compared to actual on-the-job work?\nI’m asking this genuinely to understand what I should focus on while learning.",

The important thing as that you start to learn what each individual technology does, and why it does what it does. Then how all of the different things work together. Once you know that, the individual commands will start sticking (also with repetition). You will also find yourself aliasing alot of things to save time and probably writing your own bash/zsh functions to wrap some of these.\n\nInterview expectations vs reality varies quite alot. Some places will only ask you some very basic IAC/Infra/Linux/Cloud questions and have much higher expectations when you get there. Other places will line up pretty well. Other places will just be chaos across the board. Alot depends on exactly what team you land on, so a good company can be hell if you're on the wrong team and hellish company can actually be ok if you are on a good team.\n\nThere is a joke that devops engineers are basically yaml engineers. I would say the position can have alot of varying tasks including:\n\n* Managing  and building infrastructure (servers, pipelines, repositories, internal tooling, scripts, etc)\n* Managing cloud platforms (aws/gcp/etc)\n   * Hopefully with IAC such as Terraform\n* Managing kubernetes/Upgrades\n   * Cluster components\n   * Deploying new versions of microservices\n* Firefighting\n   * Fixing all the broken things in any of the above plus more\n   * In a more chaotic place this may take up a substantial part of your day\n   * God help you at 3am when you have to firefight a bad production k8s upgrade\n* Documentation and Architecture Diagrams\n   * In a good place this will be a big part of your job (though easier with llms if you are lazy)\n* Interpersonal stuff\n   * This can be a big part of your job\n   * Chasing down individuals who know *why the hell* some legacy component or pipeline functions like it does\n   * Coordinating upgrades and breaking changes, hopefully without breaking things\n   * Answering questions\n      * I have often found there are 2-3 devs that are especially needy\n   * Finding out what the dev teams need that they don't currently have",

Your role as a DevOps professional is to ignore all of those barriers between the teams and just make sure that the problems get solved - you won't be doing all of the different roles, but you need to work with all of the relevant teams and make sure that everyone does their part in solving the problems - you will often be the one that brings the other teams together and the person who understands enough about each team's work to know how everything hangs together.\n\nSo yeah, YAML, CI/CD, whatever - you'll do a lot of that, but that's just Ops - the real extra value that makes it DevOps is breaking down those barriers.\n\nAnyway, go read The Phoenix Project.",

A very good DevOps person is also a technical architect or generalist in every area not just specific for one area... \n\nIf you want to be paid and be top of the field you become an architect in each area, learn all of the above - as your going to SDWAN for networking or build a whole cloud landingzone as IAC, then you could be doing ansible or PowerShell DSC to boot strap or apply application updates to Linux or windows machines in a hybrid cloud... Your going to deal with automation for VMware then next thing your doing is micro services and decoupling for kubernetes but needing to know how to do CI/CD with GitHub, azure DevOps, Jenkins ect\n\nThe way I look at DevOps now days is completely different scenario from if someone asked me 5-8 years ago... I am a senior technical architect and has taken me 10+ years to get here but very junior guys in the DevOps world are either focused on just one field your doing app Dev work or your learning all services for onpremise and cloud to be able to implement the services and connections for web or applications even security or networking\n\nThe only real answer here is that you can be a DevOps SME in one specific area and make good money but if you want to level up and be that standout you must not limit yourself to one area as IT changes so much best thing to do is start a home lab and use something like the cloud native landscape website and learn as much as possible play with as many different fields and be hands on its where you learn",

Some days you write scripts (bash/python/terraform), other days you’re just unblocking teams. App code happens, but not like full-time dev work.\n\nNobody memorizes all the commands. Seriously. Docs, notes, old scripts, Google, man pages… all normal. Over time you just remember the ones you use daily, the rest you look up.\n\nInterviews tend to be more theory + trivia than the job itself. On the job it’s more “can you debug this and not panic” vs reciting flags. Focus on fundamentals and understanding why things work, not just syntax.\n\n[https://www.certificationbox.com/2024/12/26/exin-devops-foundation-certification-your-success-plan/](https://www.certificationbox.com/2024/12/26/exin-devops-foundation-certification-your-success-plan/)",

Devops at least lets you be creative and write some code, where as SRE is just responding to breached thresholds and ultimately figuring out how shitty code gets to prod. Spoiler: it's always related to uninformed deadlines that get a special bypass of everything you put into place to make sure shitty code doesn't make it out. Business at it's best",

Add realistic incident scenarios - database connection pool exhaustion, memory leaks, cascading failures\n\n2. Include cost optimization challenges - right-sizing instances, identifying unused resources\n\n3. Add monitoring/observability mechanics - setting up alerts, dashboards, log aggregation\n\n4. Consider multiplayer mode where teams compete to maintain uptime while deploying features\n\n\n\nThe infrastructure management aspect is interesting. Would be great to see CI/CD pipeline building and Kubernetes cluster management as mechanics. Good luck with the project!",

      "text": "I am strongly considering becoming a nurse (then eventually taking an APRN path) or AA. Half of my family are healthcare providers and they literally never worry about jobs. My brother is 26 and made $175k as a travel nurse this year. He bought a house as well. He works 3 days a week on night shift and games when he gets home. My mother makes $250k+ as a 20-year nurse (traveling) and she is about to become an NP. I currently make six figures working remotely as a Platform Engineer, but I have mentally checked out at this point. Although I do well for myself, I don’t even feel stable enough to participate in the economy (have kids, buy a home, etc). This goes beyond just financial comparison. I am thinking about the scalability of my future (more-so my stability).\n\nI think the stress of constantly needing to learn 7 different tools that seem to do the same thing is draining. I’m tired of being a glorified YAML janitor for efforts that are only efforts because stakeholders feel like they need complex distributed system (which ends up involving using k8s with engineers who barely know how it works) architectures for shitty Drupal sites. For legacy systems, I setup abstract Ansible or Terraform workflows (because most people on my team are allergic to LLMs that can help them write IaC themselves) for people just to use once or twice a month then discard. I can’t tell if I am a data engineer or “infrastructure” dude because the lines are blurred and the people who traditionally share those roles are checked out as well. I have a security clearance, so I can’t even OE. That’s considered timesheet fraud. I want to work in the private sector, but you guys are getting cooked like fries in grease.\n\nThis may sound insane, but I would rather deal with the stress of my actual job than deal with the stress of wondering if I will have one every year. If my stability was more predictable, I would be more motivated to level up my skills consistently. Since there is actually no sense of time or grounding in this industry, I literally do the bare minimum a project requires because I know some idealistic lead or manager is going to go to a seminar and come back claiming that we need to use OpenShift for an application with 500 users. I used to actually lab, study for certs and post on LinkedIn. I stopped because it felt performative. There is now a pattern of technical theatrics I am starting to notice that is slightly disappointing. After you reach a point of no return in this field, you start to realize that the true learning is in real-work experience which is the only thing I have going for me, but the experience is not sensible. They are resume-driven vanity projects disguised as progress.\n\nI am not going to just quit since I know I am in a good spot for my age and we are in a bad economy, but sometimes the nature of our work drives me nuts. I’m sure healthcare would be hell but at least it’s a predictable hell. Imagine not knowing whether or not you’re going to be chilling in the 3rd circle, 7th circle or 9th circle on any given day. ",

While going to school for that, I was a patient transporter in a level 1 trauma center. They paid me 12 bucks an hour to take trips where you work with nurses to move patients from each floor to a different floor. These patients are in all types of conditions. I’ve moved people from ICU who have coded on their way to X-Ray. I have seen a man who tried to self-delete missing a quarter of his jaw with tears coming down his eyes. \n\nHell, I literally moved deceased patients over to the metal pan then took them to the morgue to be stored. I was 18 at the time and this was slightly traumatic, but it was less traumatic with coffee. I remember looking at the nurses, and techs (especially the techs) thinking, “I can definitely do this” but my first love was unfortunately this industry.",

The smell was awful and I was forcing myself every step of the way to be there. I constrasted that with the students who loved it and just ate it up (the subject, not the bodies :P ).

When I was in school for my engineering degree (electrical/mechanical, but toward CS which wasn't quite an established thing), it was already extremely clear that stuff that was made in the past would always need people to maintain them in the future. In the two and a half decades past that: this is still true today and in fact there's an even bigger pile of software shit that we've all created.\n\nI don't even think it's that far off from people and sickness, people pop up all the time and they get sick and hurt throughout so there's an infinite pile of human bodies to take care of: same as software/services.\n\nOf course if your job is causing you anxiety then staying in that is not great and a switch may well be the right thing for you. I've worked with quite a few RNs and I have a few friends who are internists: I don't know if I could do that type of work. It'd be way too stressful to have actual lives and people's quality of life depend on my actions. And I would worry that if my only reasoning is: I can make 6 figures as a nurse thus I will become one... seems like a great way to come in to yet another job you'll stress out about. Maybe you are passionate about helping people, coming from a family who is like that: it's not unlikely that you are... but you should consider: what is the motivation of my family members to do this work. I'd bet that it's not \"well it makes me earn 6 figures\" certainly not for nurses.",

I kind of took it upon myself to lower our cloud costs, even though no one else really cares that much. I turned it into a bit of a crusade (honestly, also thinking this was a low hanging fruit to show my worth and dedication, and also a learning experience). Even wrote here a few times about previous attempts.  \n  \nAfter doing this for the better part of a year, got us to maybe 10% cost reduction. Rightsizing, killing idle capacity, requests/limits tuning, the usual janitorial work. After that every extra percent is a fight.\n\nOur workloads are quite bursty, HPA driven, mostly stateless. Nothing exotic. Multiple instance types, multiple AZs, TTLs tuned, PDBs not insane, images pre pulled, startup times are reasonable.\n\nWe recently moved from Cluster Autoscaler to Karpenter and I really hoped this would finally let us drop baseline capacity.\n\nStill doesn’t matter. We're not very well-utilized. Cluster utilization is mostly 20–50% CPU and memory Min replicas are pretty high. But no one wants to touch those as they are our safety net.\n\nMost solutions work very well on steady workloads that are polite enough to rise slowly and at constant intervals. That's not really the case for most people I think. \n\nThat's it. I don't really have a question here. If anyone is feeling this, you're welcome to reply.",

I spent A LOT of time fighting upper management on how to actually build a platform, about translating use cases into platform evolution, maturity, etc. One of these fights was about prioritizing the feature of cost attribution, forecasting, etc. Never happened, product manager continuously came with \"what would it cost to do X?\" and they asked to \"quickly build spreadsheets\" to track stuff, which were quickly outdated.\n\nWhile I was out, upper management, 3 levels above me, started micromanaging stuff, demanding saturation of resources at 90% CPU usage (an extremely bad idea for this situation), discarding automated resource capacity allocation I had developed for manual ops because \"it didn't provide enough cost reduction\" instead of letting the team improve the automation taking into account reliability. \n\nOf course this caused several major outages, and to add insult to injury, upper management then went on about how much cost they saved making grandiose announcements about it without acknowledgement to the team that actually performed DAILY capacity adjustments with someone looking over the shoulder, and responding to 3am pages.\n\nEven worse, when i came back i demanded prioritization of using automation, which was tuned further to reduce cost, now safely, because upper management kept insisting. What I didn't know is that the push came from no data insight but \"feelings\". We overshot saving by 20% of our minimum spend on the yearly contract, and it is a lot of money. To make it worse, said upper management then asked another team to increase spend artificially to not get uncomfortable questions from leadership.\n\nI am ranting, so back to the point: be data driven, be aware of business priorities, in a classic growth phase cost is not so important. Setting the road to easily achieve optimizations down the line is important, but you will need to explain it in a business context.",

DDIA gives you the mental models, Terraform Up and Running gives you the practical implementation patterns.

For bad reasons, their MySQL database had grown to 12TB which meant a migration where we’d shift the database wasn’t going to be a possibility, as it would take too much downtime.\n\nWhat we had to do instead was boot the new app in our infra in AMS and connect it temporarily to the MySQL in Ireland but as soon as we did that, the app would fall over as each API request was making ~45 database calls to MySQL which had gone from ~1ms to ~20ms.\n\nThe solution was to create a VPN gateway so that traffic router from Ireland would go through a GCP Ireland PoP and get routed through Google’s internal backbone to egress into Ams which dropped the latency of each database request down to a much more manageable 8ms. Not amazing, but manageable for a short migration window.\n\nDealing with the VPN config and the BGP settings in GCP was a nightmare. You never knew if you were being routed via their internal network or escaping into the WAN and if you got that wrong it would send you down a wild goose chase.\n\nMaybe not the most difficult thing I’ve done, but I spent two days staring at this and it drove me near crazy.",

It started off small, maybe 5 or 6 AWS instances to run some processing and spit out some fancy data. No idea how it worked, I was the backend guy setting it up with Chef and automation. Well, then someone wanted a visualization of the data, so that got added. But then a new guy wanted a different visualization package, but the original one was in too wide a use (even though it wasn't actually in prod yet) to just replace, so now we had two separate big visualization and data processors sitting on top. Then they wanted to do a full mapreduce on it to further enrich the data or something, which required another whole big infrastructure on top of it using MapR. Then they wanted to export all that data to a couple big warehouses, again more than one because the team involved couldn't agree on one. In the end the 5 or 6 instances ballooned to over 100, all barely working properly and barely fitting together using my handspun chef and terraform setups. We'd spent over a million dollars up to that point and absolutely none of it was actually \"prod\", and the monthly costs of all the cloud infra plus license costs for all the bits and bobs was astronomical.\n\nAbout a year in the C-suite finally took notice and started looking into it. Turned out the relatively new senior manager who was heading up the plan was a cofounder and early investor or something in the main big data processor thing that got added in and was a major part of the expense. The whole thing was a giant mess and never worked properly. The manager was let go rather loudly, as well as a few folks he'd brought in, and the engineering department ended up having a big party where we tore down the whole infrastructure bit by bit. Imagine the Office Space fax machine scene except everyone was taking turns clicking Terminate on AWS instances. Even though I was the main engineer on the project handling the backend, basically everyone had been dragged into it at some point and had a vendetta. It probably ultimately cost a couple million that went nowhere, which wasn't immediately fatal but a decent chunk of money for a company our size. They ended up getting acquired a year or so later and I wouldn't be surprised if the fallout from this was part of why it was necessary.\n\nOne part of why it got this bad was my team, the syseng/devops/infrastructure/whatever they were calling it that week, didn't have a direct manager for a good couple years for various reasons. So I was basically at the whim of the other manager(s) and didn't have someone watching my back that I could report to even though I knew it was going south. And the senior manager guy had a lot of sway at the company so nobody really listened to me.",

I’m exploring a way to reduce EKS costs even further without rewriting everything from scratch without EKS.\n\n**Most advice (and what I’ve done before) clusters around:**\n\n- Spot + smart autoscaling (Karpenter, consolidation, mixed instance types)\n- Rightsizing requests/limits, bin packing, node shapes, and deleting idle workloads\n- Graviton/ARM where possible\n- Reduce cross-AZ spend (or even go single AZ if you can)\n- FinOps visibility (Kubecost, etc.) to find the real culprits (eg, unallocated requests)\n- “Kubernetes tax” avoidance: move some workloads to ECS/Fargate when you can\n\nBut even after doing all this, EC2 is just… Expensive.\n\n**So I'm playing around with a hybrid EKS cluster:**\n\n- Keep the managed EKS control plane in AWS\n- Run worker nodes on much cheaper compute outside AWS (e.g. bare metal servers on Hetzner)\n- Burst to EC2 for spikes using labels/taints + Karpenter on the AWS node pools\n\nAWS now offers “EKS Hybrid Nodes” for this, but the pricing is even more expensive than EC2 itself (why?), so I’m experimenting with a hybrid setup without that managed layer.\n\n**Questions for the crowd:**\n\n- Would you ever run production workloads on off-AWS worker nodes while keeping EKS control plane in AWS? Why/why not?\n- What’s the biggest deal-breaker: networking latency, security boundaries, ops overhead, supportability, something else?\n\nIf this resonates, I’m happy to share more details (or a small writeup) once I’ve cleaned it up a bit.",

For those kind of workloads, it makes sense. For a business, I don’t know if it does considering you can spin up spot instances as necessary for fractions of the price. Also, data compliance could be an issue. \n\nI don’t see how it could be worth the squeeze but if the data crunching is enough and you have enough spare machines, and the server costs are a deal breaker, I can see it but most businesses won’t consider it realistically.",

Find a process that works for you and try to stick to it assuming the deadline isn't yesterday.\n\nMaking no decision is often worse than making the wrong one and correcting it later.\n\nI'm also sure your employer understands they assigned 2 green resources to the project.

I was way over my head, I had to go to the CTO and basically demand they hire someone more senior than myself…we did and it didn’t fix the broken processes that led to me being the only SysAdmin for a fairly large company. But it gave me time to look for something else.\n\nEssentially I found out they saw it as a way to save money on hiring an actual Senior engineer at the time or even a proper team. I found this out when I asked for a raise to match my current position and stress level and they basically said no and that I could get to my requested salary with OT and working 6 days a week for the year. 35k (my help desk pay) for a senior says admin billion dollar company across 3 data centers Ummm no.\n\nMoral of the story, know your worth and watch out for “family” company’s trying to scam you and masking it as a “learning opportunity” ",

There are still some stateful configurations that I would not manage in IaC. For instance: Okta group and app assignments should happen based on Group Rules as much as possible, but there will always be plenty of cases where a user has to be manually assigned to a group. Unless there was some edge case caveat that required it, I would not manage bespoke group assignments for users in Terraform.

          "text": "The single biggest reason I ever use ClickOps is because my CSP (AWS) is likely to automatically automate creation of most of the supporting infrastructure through ClickOps but not through IaC. For example, the web EC2 launch flow will walk me through creating everything from security group to VPC to IAM role / policy, key attachments, etc etc. Versus with Terraform, I would have to define every single one of these resources verbosely as separate blocks, often requiring two resources per soas to perform attachments.\n\nSo it is definitely quicker for me to spin up an EC2 instance using ClickOps as compared to using Terraform, which leads to my using ClickOps for incredibly self-contained one-off tests (usually in separate “sandbox” sub account from production infrastructure). As soon as I am ready to productionize something, it moves to IaC and I eat the cost of writing all of the resource definitions / attachments, accept that this makes my work more auditable / reproducible / controlled.\n\nOther reasons people may opt for ClickOps over IaC:\n- easier to get off the ground; if I’m “learning AWS”, i may be following AWS-specific tutorials that tell you to use console and never even mention Terraform.\n- may require less permissions; integrating with an org’s existing IaC often requires greater permissions than using ClickOps — read/write to state, permissions to interact with existing projects, etc.\n- always quicker for one off tasks — indeed, I have used click ops once or twice for production cases in the past ~year as a breakglass mechanism to support emergency temporary workarounds eg temporary policy attachments. Not a massive auditability issue thanks to CloudTrail\n\nTL;DR IaC is almost always better for production-ready, reviewed, reusable infrastructure. ClickOps is quicker to spin up incredibly small self-contained resources with few interdependencies.",

So when someone just needs a bucket, a queue, or a one-off change, the console feels faster—and often *safer*—than touching a brittle pipeline they don’t fully understand.\n\nMost teams I’ve seen don’t reject IaC outright; they stall somewhere along the way on **usability**. Core infrastructure is codified, but day-2 changes, experiments, and exceptions quietly fall back to the UI.\n\nA big part of this is that tools like Terraform, Pulumi, Ansible (hell, even Kubernetes) are often treated *as the platform*, rather than tools for building one. That shifts a lot of operational responsibility and domain knowledge onto developers, even though cloud APIs themselves are a messy mix of ops and app concerns.\n\nUntil infrastructure workflows are genuinely easier than the console for non-experts, ClickOps is going to keep winning in practice.\n\nI wrote more about why IaC adoption seems stuck, would love to hear others thoughts.

If the POC turns into something we might intend to keep around, we're going to want to turn it into IaC anyway, just do it up front. It's not a lot of work, you have auto-complete in most modern editors, and co-pilot if you swing that way.\n\n  \nEdit: The lack of peer-review and reproducibility is enough reason to outright ban ClickOps in my opinion.

This was aimed primarily at AWS, which was monetizing their product, but it ended up alienating many of their own supporters as well.  ES also had a history of being somewhat difficult to manage at scale (balancing shards, JVM issues, nodes joining/leaving) and new development stalled.  While the licensing changes were eventually reversed (and AWS forked the project into OpenSearch), this all led to a lot of other tools gaining traction, especially as new tools were coming up in the container-first world of k8s and structured logging.  I believe it was also the case that very large companies were running into operational constraints with ES, due to its fundamental design as a document database.  While excellent at full-text search, at petabyte scale and beyond many industry leaders started looking to columnar / OLAP solutions such as ClickHouse or metadata-only indexing such as Loki.  ES/OpenSearch is still relevant and widely used, so I don’t think it’s bad to learn at all, but most of the people building their own stack today might choose something else (LGTM stack), and the larger enterprise tends to favor fully managed solutions like AWS OpenSearch or Splunk in my experience.",

Loki is pretty great at 'spray and pray' when it comes to log aggregation and datatyping where Logstash/Elastic you have to be very deliberate and intentional about field mappings.  \n\nThis might be a somewhat spicy opinion but I think that Elastic kicks the crap out of pretty much everyone if you are doing more advanced things other than a pretty way to grep syslog.  If you're using logs for basically just troubleshooting pretty much every option listed in this thread is a better option.  If you're using logs as a source of data, doing ML jobs for deep analysis, or using Elastic as a vector database it is one of the best tools around for it.  The security/SIEM tooling is fantastic.",

When we were evaluating options at BlueTalon, we ended up going with Elastic for our internal security monitoring and it was one of those decisions that just kept paying dividends. The correlation rules engine and the ML-based anomaly detection saved our security team so much time compared to the manual alert tuning we were doing before.\n\nThe Kibana learning curve is real though. I remember our junior engineers would get frustrated trying to build dashboards that would take 5 minutes in Grafana. But once you get past that initial hump, you can do some pretty sophisticated stuff - we had it doing real-time risk scoring on user behavior patterns that would've cost us 10x more with a commercial SIEM. Still use Elastic at Okahu for our security telemetry, though we keep the basic app logs in Loki just because it's simpler for the team.",

First and most important is leadership/managerial. If you have time to slow down a bit, investigate and improve - good. Count this almost solved. If the speed of development will grow - it's almost a lost cause. \n\nSecond is budget. I have multiple experiences when parallelising causes flakiness. Test infra simply doesn't cope and often there's no monitoring to see this. Look for DB connection pool exhaustion, look for DB load, look for compute and memory resources. A few years ago we hit a very painful wall. We had to significantly increase compute for TEST DB server. There's 20 people working there (testers, devs, analysts) and 25 test runners. That's on par with average production user count at the time. This costs money and escalates quickly. We also had to clean up the DB continuously.\n\nThird, platform settings. Once we sort DB issues out, we hit an obscure ingress/nginx/cdn issue which caused some requests to fail. Found similar issue by accident on Nginx github and found which config was stupidly low. We hit this only by running 25 tests in parallel and hit a connection limit. \n\nFourth, smart tests. A lot depends on testability of the system and often you can't change it. Aim at smaller tests, but do connect them in logical dependencies. Often an antipattern... but hey, most likely all system under tests is a book of antipatterns. Aim at test re-runs by the test runner framework. Find flaky places and add retries around them. Replace shitty form submission with REST calls to same API. \n\nFifth and last, prioritise and \"quarantine\" flaky tests. Move them to a parallel pipeline that won't block the release. Take a look at failures as they come. Fix if needed. Obviously this relates to secondary functionality that is not critical and/or not used frequently. \n\ngood luck 👋",

This means you have something non-deterministic in your tests. You need to isolate what the root cause for each failure is and figure out where the non-determinism is coming from. \n\nI spent a bunch of effort improving the reliability of tests for my UI team because it was causing a massive productivity loss and general unhappiness within the team. Issues we'd been living with for a very long time. You'll be amazed what a couple of people taking a week to focus on it can achieve. Our pipeline now almost never fails outside of a genuine issue. Some things were very simple like adding a script which waits for the server to have finished bundling properly before Cypress tests start. Some things were more complex like adding a wrapper which fails any test which attempts to access an external resource so we could identify where mocks had been missed. A final thing was moving all the pipeline jobs to be container based so we had more reliable compute resource and configuration.\n\nSecondly, you have performance. There's no reason tests should be slow. \n\nI don't have much experience with UI testing, but common mistakes I've seen countless times on backend software is using sleep operations to advance time. They're unreliable and slow, and often are both more reliable and faster if you have a mock clock you can advance and semaphores to handle multi-threaded conditions. On the UI side you can also get a handle on things like timers and manually advance them by specific time increments to assert behaviours. \n\nStart with your slowest test and identify where the time is being spent. You'll probably find patterns that apply to many more tests. \n\nParallelism is a good final step, but it's worth ironing out any big test performance issues before just making it parallel. You want the tests to be fast so developers can run them quickly and easily without having to wait for the pipeline to tell them they broke something. \n\nInvestment in test stability and performance easily pays itself off, especially when you have a decent sized team and you're already losing lots of time to it. \n\nFrom a prioritisation point of view, it's one of the non-discretionary jobs in my mind. We don't ask the business for permission to do this kind of work, we just do it. I will pad out how long other features are going to take to deliver, or push back start dates on features, to make the time for these tasks.",

If you only run tests on trunk (such as a nightly test run), you will inevitably end up with broken code being merged into it - which means it can't be used as the base for further development until it has been fixed. Might be fine for a one-person team, but it quickly turns into a serious problem with larger teams.\n\nThe feedback loop doesn't **have** to be 40 minutes for the developers, though. They should also be able to run the same test suite locally, which should hopefully run an awful lot faster. If it already passes locally, then it should be pretty much a guarantee that it also passes in CI.\n\nCombine that with a [merge queue](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-a-merge-queue) and that 40-minute CI runtime becomes essentially irrelevant.\n\nOf course, that only works when your tests are actually deterministic.

You said yourself your devs can't trust the tests so they are 100% useless, even if they took only 3 minutes to finish and you reran them 10 times you wouldn't be able to trust that they're testing the code properly if half of the runs fail and half of them pass.",

          "text": "I've been in similar situations before. When you're seeing failures every run that move around, it's usually not \"selectors are flawed\" so much as the system (tests, env, pipeline) isn't deterministic yet, and the suite has become an untrustworthy gate. \n\nIf it helps, here's some steps that might help get signal and apply fixes:\n\nWhat do the failures look like?\n- are they timeout, stale elements, element not found, assert mismatches, navigation, 5xx/network, browser crashes?\n- do they cluster around particular areas (login, search, checkout etc.) or are they truly random? \n- is there correlation with parallelism level, runner type, time of day or specific envs? \n\nHow deterministic is the state/data?\n- are tests sharing users/data? Or does each test have its own data and cleanup? \n- are you setting a state via API/setup hooks (fast, consistent), or driving everything through the UI (slow, fragile)?\n\nHow stable is the environment/ infrastructure?\n- shared ling lived environment vs isolation per run?\n- real external dependencies involved (auth/email/payments) vs stubs?\n- any signs of runner starvation (CPU/memory) or environment bottlenecks?\n\n\nAnd what you can do with the answers:\n1. Add a tiny bit of observability to the suite\n    - start tagging failures with a simple reason code: timing/wait, data collision, env instability, infra starvation, selectors/DOM, real bug.\n    - track two numbers per test: flake rare and runtime contribution\n    - you'll usually find a small set of tests/ specs causing a disproportionate chunk of pain\n\n2. Fix the gate design (so you stop paying the full cost on every PR):\n    - 650 tests (on every PR)some/ most/ all being ui e2e is effectively saying \"everything is critical\"\n    - should split these into tiers:\n      - PR gate: fast checks and a small UI smoke/ critical path subset\n      - broader e2e: larger critical set and the full regression in a separate lane.\n    - add a quarantine policy: flaky tests don't block merges, but stay visible and owned. Otherwise \"rerun-to-green\" becomes the workflow.\n\n3. Attack the usual flake sources:\n    - data isolation: unique data per test/ run, avoid shared accounts, make setup/teardown idempotent.\n    - deterministic synchronisation: remove sleeps, wait for the app states/events, assert in stable states. \n    - reduce shared environment interference: minimise cross-test coupling, stabalise/stub the most unreliable external does where it's appropriate\n\n4. treat speed separately from reliability:\n    - once the above is under control, you can revisit the speed (sharing, controlled parallelism, better runners).\n    - if you ever consider swapping tooling for speed/ ergonomics, it can help, but it's best treated as an investment decision AFTER you've nailed whether flake is env/data/infra vs test code.\n\nI'm also of the opinion (and I know it's not always shared) that retries aren't the best solution - a single retry can be a temporary mitigation for known transient infra hiccups, but if reruns are the normal path to green, it teaches everyone to ignore red builds. \n\nIf you're able to share one or two representative failure tipes (timeout vs stale element vs assertion vs network), it's usually possible to tell pretty quickly whether you're looking at data/env/infra instability or test design issues\n\n\nAs a side note: screw writing things this long on the mobile app again 😂😭",

Not being able to trust a test is more harmfull than no test at all.    \n- Have test filters. Eg. Tests that are run for every PR and test that are run several times a day. Dotr slow down developers.        \n- Have dedicated hardware / cloud runners. We had 15 VM machines running tests in parallel. Also using browserstack etc to test different browsers.    \n- Have good test reports / reproduceability for developers to fix bugs afterwards. I built own test framework that \"marked\" / coloured clicked / selected elements and removed color on next click. Made it clear whhat was selected and if something wrong was selected.      \n- Bonus to prior. Have code coverage tool if posible. Being able to see what code is hit by what tests also help narrow down bug fixing.        \n- Use best practice / patterns builting E2E tests. This greatly reduce flakiness and make tests easier to fix when UI changes. Eg PageObject design pattern and others.       \n- Dont be afraid to delete tests.      \n- Remeber to built your UI to being easy to test. Eg. Giving your components component Id. Eg: <div data-id=\"dialog-box\" ....> .. </div>. This will give E2E test a great way to reach root of a component and .innerText() or whatever is needed.     \n\nThis is just whats top of my mind.

Contractors, accountants, devs jumping in to help, sometimes even temporary automation. Rotating everything constantly is not realistic, but keeping things as they are feels irresponsible.\nI am looking for recommendations on better ways to handle this. Ideally something where access can be granted without exposing credentials and can be revoked instantly without breaking everything else. How are others solving this after a scare like this?",

          "text": ">Rotating everything constantly is not realistic\n\nWhen you say \"not realistic\", what you actually mean is \"too much effort\".\n\nUltimately this all comes down to hygiene and process:\n\n1. Shared access to anything should be removed wherever possible. Every dev gets their own credentials to everything. Why are you using shared API keys? Everyone gets their own. \n\n2. Where shared access is absolutely unavoidable, then the scope must be limited and access-controlled wherever possible. Password managers, or JIT logins, etc. Having a single password vault which everyone can access is only slightly better than having a shared document with everything written on it.\n\n3. Credentials used by systems must be secured/encrypted. Devs cannot be using the API key that the finance service uses to talk to the mailing service, or logging into the database with the authentication service's password. Every service has its own credentials, stored securely and not visible to anyone who does not have direct access to the machine running the service. \n\n4. Have a rock-solid onboarding and offboarding process, automated and cross-checked as much as possible to ensure that credentials are created and deleted appropriately. If devs get access to systems by asking their teammates to create credentials, then you're in trouble.\n\n5. Rotate credentials. This only difficult when you never designed your systems to accomodate it. But once you do it the first time, you now know how to do it. Doing it automatically then becomes easy.\n\n6. Audit. Create scripts and dashboards to scan logs and databases looking for new logins by old keys, sending emails to remind you (and everyone else) that their keys need to be rotated, automatically disabling old keys, looking for usage of credetnials belonging to former employees, etc, etc. This is the one I used to hate because a regular old script which connects to a DB, searches records, parses all the data, formats it, and sends emails, is easy but boring as hell. It's a day's work that you don't wanna do. LLMs spit it out for me in an hour.",

We have three separate doppler configs for most services: dev, ci, and prod. No one EVER needs the prod keys. The prod config is literally only accessed during a production build via a service token, and every key has a companion in the other configs.\n\nThe dev config is where the magic happens, because we can fork the config. So when we need to give access to a key to someone, what we actually do is fork the dev config, generate new tokens just for their config, and then the doppler runtime wrapper automatically loads their keys at runtime instead of the main dev config. We configured it so they can get a short-lived access token to obtain their keys. They have to refresh the token daily to maintain access, and we can destroy the forked dev config at any time.\n\nOn our side, we are generating keys and forking configs. On their side, they just learn how to authenticate with doppler and then they can use our toolchains without having to trade keys around.",

If our user’s account was blocked, all keys given out to that user were canceled. For very short term contractors, they used their own OAuth source, eg. their work account or personal email account, and we could cancel their keys in the app. Long term contractors got an account in our 365.\n\nKeys given to people were always temporary, and all of them would auto-expire. They were also revocable in our app. So any dev could cancel a key they got handed out but didn’t need anymore.\n\nKeys given to automation were issued as secrets directly to the GitHub account. Most of the time at least. Then, the dev never saw them nor had to copy-paste them anywhere. If a dev needed a key for access from their desktop IDE or scripts, they could get one via the app, but that was on the rarer side.\n\nThe app had templates for commonly needed sets of keys. So if something needed 5 different API keys, they could be issued as a bundle, and canceled/revoked as a bundle.\n\nPutting API keys issued from the app in chats or anything like that was not allowed. For our teams and slack we added automation that detected valid API keys in posts and anonymized them.\n\nWe generally did not allow keys from 3rd parties that couldn’t be revoked at least in a semi-automated way. If someone was giving us a demo key, we could put it in the app together with the email of the issuer. If the app needed to revoke the key, it’d shoot an email to the issuer and open a case so someone had to follow up on it. A vendor or two gave us self-revocable demo/evaluation keys that you could revoke via their api. We would add those api calls to the app so it was automated.\n\nIn general, our mantra was that every key was handed out by the app to a person, and we had a current inventory of any valid (non-revoked) keys issued to any person and/or repository.\n\nThis was on the dev/test side of things. Prod had its own key issuance api. There too we could cancel any and all keys deployed, and had an inventory.\n\nI got the MVP for that app written over a couple of weekends and then others took up maintenance/enhancements. It was a lifesaver several times. And we weren’t a big company either, less than 50 people.",

Some services have this features built-in (think AWS' assume-role) some will never have it (think some random ftp server).\n\nTangentially: one of the things I have on my todo list and will be pushing for is fido/u2f security keys (think yubikey). If I can manage to bridge AWS with Google Workspace for authentication and force more services to login via google (either directly or through keycloak) that should be fixed.\n\nThat being said: api keys should always have an expiration that's machine readable (in the sense that when you load the key, the library should be able to emit a warning about the api key expiring in like ~30 days or whatever). This should either be part of the key (think jwt tokens) or part of the API you're consuming (this of course makes sense if you are the one emitting the api key and receiving requests - in this case you should have an endpoint to check for api key validity).\n\n\nOne more sidenote: IIRC stackoverflow had a policy that if an api key was sent to some endpoint in plaintext (http rather than https) then the key was assumed to be compromised as it had traveled over an insecure channel and immediately invalidated. The user had then to provision a new api key and MAKE SURE to only call api endpoints over https.",

                  "text": "Yeah, fair question\n\nThe website… some of it is definitely “vibecoded” right now. I needed something live, and I’ve used AI to crank out placeholder copy + structure while I’m juggling work/life and building it out. I’m slowly replacing it with more real stuff as I go.\n\nThe podcast… the audio is not AI generated. I write my own notes, record it myself, and edit it. For the weekly news episodes, the inputs are basically what you’d expect… SRE Weekly, TLDR DevOps, AWS blogs, vendor release notes, random stuff I run into at work. It’s a human-curated recap, not a robot reading scraped articles. Interviews are just real 1:1 conversations with people I reach out to (or who reach out to me).\n\nThe bigger risk isn’t “using AI”, it’s pretending you didn’t and putting out generic fluff IMO.\n\nOn the job prospects point… I don’t think having AI-assisted content hurts you unless it makes you look inauthentic or sloppy. If you’re a senior DevOps person with 10+ years, your credibility comes from your real opinions, war stories, and how you think through problems. AI can help with the boring parts (thumbnails, show notes formatting, site scaffolding). It shouldn’t be the “voice”.\n\nAlso, the show has been doing fine. Ship It Weekly hit Apple Podcasts Top 10 in the US “Tech News” list recently, which tells me listeners care more about signal than the tooling used to package it:\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/grouping/tech-news/196859\n\nIf you’re thinking of doing something similar, I’d say go for it, but keep it simple. If you want, tell me what format you’re considering (news, interviews, study sessions, etc.) and I’ll give you some recs. I’d also be open to assistance if you’d want to help with Ship It Weekly.",

      "text": "context: migrating from docker swarm to k8s. small team, needed to move fast. i had some k8s experience but never owned a prod cluster\n\nused cursor to generate configs for our 12 services. honestly saved my ass, would have taken days otherwise. got deployments, services, ingress done in maybe an hour. ran in staging for a few days, did some basic load testing on the api endpoints, looked solid\n\ndeployed tuesday afternoon during low traffic window. everything fine for about 6 hours. then around 9pm our monitoring started showing weird patterns - some requests fast, some timing out, no clear pattern\n\nspent the next few hours debugging the most confusing issue. turns out multiple things were breaking simultaneously:\n\nour main api was crashlooping but only 3 out of 8 pods. took forever to realize the ai set liveness probe initialDelaySeconds to 5s. works fine in staging where we have tiny test data. prod loads way more reference data on startup, usually takes 8-10 seconds but varies by node. so some pods would start fast enough, others kept getting killed mid-initialization. probably network latency or node performance differences, never figured out exactly why\n\nwhile fixing that, noticed our batch processor was getting cpu throttled hard. ai had set pretty conservative limits - 500m cpu for most services. batch job spikes to like 2 cores during processing. didnt catch it in staging because we never run the full batch there, just tested the api layer\n\nthen our cache service started oom killing. 256Mi limit looked reasonable in the configs but under real load it needs closer to 1Gi. staging cache is basically empty so never saw this coming\n\nthe configs themselves were fine, just completely generic. real problem was my staging environment told me nothing useful:\n\n* test dataset is 1% of prod size\n* never run batch jobs in staging\n* no real traffic patterns\n* didnt know startup probes were even a thing\n* zero baseline metrics for what \"normal\" looks like\n\nbasically ai let me move fast but i had no idea what i didnt know. thought i was ready because the yaml looked correct and staging tests passed\n\ntook about 2 weeks to get everything stable:\n\n* added startup probes (game changer for slow-starting services)\n* actually load tested batch scenarios\n* set up prometheus properly, now i have real data\n* resource limits based on actual usage not guesses\n* tried a few different tools for generating configs after this mess. cursor is fast but pretty generic. copilot similar. someone mentioned verdent which seems to pick up more context from existing services, but honestly at this point i just validate everything manually regardless of what generates it\n\ncosts are down about 25% vs swarm which is nice. still probably over-provisioned in places but at least its stable\n\nlesson learned: ai tools are incredible for velocity but they dont teach you what questions to ask. its like having an intern who codes really fast but never tells you when something might be a bad idea",

That said, once you move past basic usage, the combination of IAM complexity, cost attribution, and compliance-related questions adds a non-trivial amount of cognitive overhead. For context, our requirements are fairly standard: VMs, networking, backups, and some basic automation,,, nothing particularly exotic.\n\nBecause we’re EU-focused, I’ve been benchmarking a few non-hyperscaler setups in parallel, mostly as a sanity check to understand tradeoffs rather than as a migration plan. One of the environments I tested was a Swiss-based IaaS (Xelon), primarily to look at API completeness, snapshot semantics, and what day-2 operations actually feel like compared to AWS.\n\nThe experience was mixed in predictable ways: fewer abstractions and less surface area, but also a smaller ecosystem and less polish overall. It did, however, make it easier to reason about certain operational behaviors.\n\nIdk what the “right” long-term answer is, but I’m interested in how others approach this in practice: Do you default to hyperscalers until scale demands otherwise, or do you intentionally optimize for simplicity earlier on?\n",

You can run workloads on different clouds, bare metal, local machines, etc more easily vs needing a particular stack of services and apis only offered on one cloud. ymmv\n\nI've found this particularly useful in this age of gpu scarcity - our main workloads run on AWS, but we can scale out to multiple different clouds for various training GPU needs. I'm currently running workloads on AWS, GCP, Azure, LambdaLabs, and Hetzner with support for a couple more.",

But once it's installed, it also provides the default k8s API, so you basically have two administrative endpoints on different ports, one for Talos (the OS) and one for the K8s API.\n\nWe are in the process of switching from bare metal which we managed with Ansible (\\~90 servers) and with the new k8s cluster, we still use Ansible for boostrapping and Talos configuration management. Since Talos configuration is all yaml, we can utilize Ansible dictionaries. Basically, we wrote a base Talos config and set up overlays for controlplanes, shared worker config, storage-workers, db-workers and compute workers and depending on the node type. The whole cluster configuration is in the repo and the secrets are encrypted via ansible-vault. When bootstrapping/configuring a node, the specific config for that node gets rendered from the templates/overlays and then applied.\n\nI'm sure we could optimize some stuff but for now, we're pretty happy with our setup, we can upgrade by just changing one value and running one playbook and add new nodes by just creating another VM which has booted from a Talos ISO, add it to an Ansible group and the playbook does the rest.",

While DO doesn't have a lot of the more complex services, I was amazed at how much simpler they make everything.  There's a cost estimate built in to the web form for anything you build.  Your estimated monthly cost is at the top of the page.  Standard instance compute was more or less equal in price to EC2, but like a GPU instance is about a fifth the price.  You don't really see anyone posting on Reddit about the time they accidentally ran up $10K in charges on DO and there's a reason for that.\n\nThe next time I get roped in to another startup, I think I'll take on the challenge of building out a less complex infra for as long as I can.  Even the TF for DO is an order of magnitude simpler (granted, I haven't tried doing anything interesting yet like instance roles or conditional logic).  I wish there was more of a serverless approach available, as I've gotten used to the idea of not really worrying about scaling (for some things).  But DO could do at least half of what my $250K/mo org is doing in AWS and it would be significantly cheaper and less complex (if we didn't have to refactor every line of AWS service-specific code in our platforms).",

You’ll also get to the point where you’ll be able to recognise other domains and be familiar with the principles.\n\nWith AI, most businesses are enabling by subscribing to platforms such as Azure Foundry or SAP Business AI or similar. They come with models and update them reasonably regularly. They will show you how to create agents to use cases. Play around with the models enough and you’ll get to HuggingFace and Unsloth etc and weighting models to create your own (they’re not really new, as in you’re not creating them from scratch like the big foundation labs).

The more you rely on a specific domain of knowledge at work, the more you should be diving into it. Being excellent at those things is literally your job. \n\nThen from there when you hear of a tool or technology you should find out what problems it solves, and determine if it actually solves any problems for you. If it does, learn it at a shallow level. If not, ignore it. For example ArgoCD doesn't appear to solve any problems for me, as the problems it solves, I've already solved in other ways using my existing CI systems. I'm not going to learn to use a tool that doesn't benefit me yet even if it is very popular. I understand what it does and why it doesn't benefit me right now, and that is enough.\n\nFor you, you want to learn Golang. So what problems does Golang solve that Python doesn't? I actually have a bias toward Golang, and against Python. But ask yourself what paint points you experience from Python, and how Golang handles those better (if better.) And then when you go to learn Golang, you'll of course want to learn the syntax and general styling guidelines, but beyond that you'll really want to focus on the specific features that improve on the pain points you experienced in Python.\n\nThat's basically how you go about prioritizing topics, IMHO. But the hard part is learning them. For me, books are slow and verbose, and tech articles are filled with annoying self-aggrandizement. The only real way for me to learn something is to do it. Build a project on the thing you're learning. And for the love of god don't just use an AI chatbot to do the project for you. Start by reading the documentation. Get your own work together. If you get stuck for an extended period of time without progress, try the chatbots, but then take its output and figure out how the output works with the documentation. And then fix what the chatbot output because usually it will tell you how to do something horribly incorrectly, but with just enough accuracy to seem like it'll work.",

Constantly learning and finding good happy patterns to keep in my back pocket. \n\nWe all got moved around or laid off and I started putting DevOps on my resume.

Mostly solving developer and system admin problems, but really any friction across the SDLC.\n\nWhat actually helps solving those problems is understanding them.  And there's no better way to understand a problem than by having it yourself...as a developer...as a system administrator.\n\n>What actually helped you get your first role?\n\nThis is why most successful \"DevOps\" folks came from development or system administration, roles that often don't understand the needs of each other.  A \"DevOps\" role can help aid understanding and direct solutions that span the SDLC, helping break problems out of their silos so that more inclusive solutions can be made. -There's also the mostly mythical idea that if you just lock the (mostly introverted) devs and the (very introverted) sysadmins in a box for a while that \"DevOps culture\" will magically happen...all evidence and common sense to the contrary.\n\nFor myself I was a developer and I/we kept having issues which seemed like they should have a software solution.  No one else was interested in solving the problems (they were happy pulling tickets off the backlog), so I jumped into it.  Very quickly I had enough success smoothing out our release processes that within a few months I wasn't working on normal development projects at all, instead I was the full time \"release manager\" for all the company's projects.\n\n>When did you personally feel “ready” for a job versus just learning tools?\n\nAsk yourself questions like, \"*What are the most common pain points that the dev team is facing?*\".  Same question for the system/cloud admin?  Same question for support?  Same question for the business owners?  Same question for legal/compliance?  Same question for FinOps?\n\nIf you can't answer these for many if not most of these groups, you're probably not \"ready\" for \"DevOps\".\n\n**It's not about tools.  Tools come** ***last.***  **People > Process > Tools**\n\nGet experience doing anything else in the SDLC, be that development, admin, testing, sre, etc.  In whatever that role is always be striving to solve problems not just for your role or silo, but consider how your solutions will affect the other roles.  For example if you're a dev implementing a configuration module, how will that affect the admins who actually have to use it for deployments?  How secure would the InfoSec team consider it?  If you're storing state like sessions, what is that going to look like at scale and during scale transitions that the SRE team is going to need to consider?  When you're writing commit messages, are you using a format that will make the project manager's job easier when compiling release notes?",

Improve CI/CD skills. Handle on-call duties confidently. Each step had clear signals that you were \"leveling up.\" But the longer I've been in this industry, the weaker those signals have become.\n\nMost of my growth now comes from ambiguous situations. Design reviews with unclear requirements. Stakeholders changing priorities mid-quarter. Post-mortems where no individual mistakes yet the system still crashed. These moments force you to articulate the reasons behind your choices. \n\nThis is also where AI is starting to appear in my workflow; I use it to help me with reviews.Because more and more situations aren't simply solved by mastering a skill. It ultimately comes down to soft skills. I'm becoming the kind of manager I used to dislike, haha. I interact with more people than I use tools every day. I'm currently preparing for a job change, and I've noticed my preparation process is different this time. While I still use resources like Indeed or IQB interview question banks and  GPT or Beyz coding assistant for mock interviews, the goal this time is to slow down and make my reasoning process clearer. AI can speed up execution, but I feel that senior engineers need slower, clearer thinking for growth. This isn't something that can be easily quantified by how many problems you've solved or how many projects you've led. Even the feedback is much more ambiguous than learning a new tool.\n\nI'm still unsure what the \"correct\" learning path looks like at this stage. It feels like becoming a sponge absorbing and disseminating information. The influencing factors and things to balance have become much more numerous than before. Where are the boundaries of this career development/promotion title? I recently saw an interesting analogy: we are a collection of cells constantly controlling the influx and efflux of new and old matter. So how do we determine \"new\" and \"old\" in our growth?",

Since the proxy is stateless it is easy to scale it and it doesn't eat the precious resources of the primary database. The parsing/logging is happening asynchronously from the proxying\n\nSo far it is working good, I still need to hammer it with more load tests and do some edge case testing (e.g. behavior when the database is extremely slow). I wrote the same thing for MySQL with the idea to open-sourcing it.\n\nI'm not sure if other people will be interested in utilizing such proxy, so here I am asking about your opinion.\n\nEdit: Grammar",

      "text": "Hello, all. [Luxury Yacht](https://github.com/luxury-yacht/app) is a desktop app for managing Kubernetes clusters that I've been working on for the past few months. It's available for macOS, Windows, and Linux. It's built with [Wails v2](https://wails.io/). Huge thanks to Lea Anthony for that awesome project. Can't wait for Wails v3.\n\nThis originally started as a personal project that I didn't intend to release. I know there are a number of other good apps in this space, but none of them work quite the way I want them to, so I decided to build one. Along the way it got good enough that I thought others might enjoy using it.\n\nLuxury Yacht is FOSS, and I have no intention of ever charging money for it. It's been a labor of love, a great learning opportunity, and an attempt to try to give something back to the FOSS community that has given me so much.\n\nIf you want to get a sense of what it can do without downloading and installing it, [read the primer](https://github.com/luxury-yacht/app/blob/main/docs/primer.md). Or, head to the [Releases](https://github.com/luxury-yacht/app/releases) page to download the latest release.\n\nOh, a quick note about the name. I wanted something that was fun and invoked the nautical theme of Kubernetes, but I didn't want yet another \"K\" name. A conversation with a friend led me to the name \"Luxury Yacht\", and I warmed up to it pretty quickly. It's goofy but I like it. Plus, it has a Monty Python connection, which makes me happy.",

I've got a few laptops that I run it on. I've got a pretty new M4 Max MBP, an M1 Pro MBP (running Asahi Linux), and a 5-year-old System 76 Gazelle. It seems to run pretty well on the older stuff. I've used it with some fairly large EKS clusters (1000-ish pods) courtesy of my day job, and it seems to do well on those. But truth is there are a lot of possible configs out there it's never seen.

So far I’ve peeped into Docker and I got comfortable with using Linux, but it’s not so easy for me to do project based learning, since you need some general knowledge of what the problems are in DevOps. I don’t struggle with finding projects on technology I already know because I know what it can do and what it can’t do. But I’m barely touching the tip of the iceberg here! DevOps seems like such a huge rabbit hole, but it seems very interesting and I do want to learn more about it.\n\nAll help is much appreciated!",

It isn't about specific technologies, it's about the underlying reasons those technologies are used; so Docker vs Podman, Xunit vs NUnit, Jenkins vs Team City, AWS vs Azure etc, none of these decisions specifically matter as long as you choose one of the solutions to do the job that they take care of.  Check out Dave Farley's excellent YouTube channel Modern Software Engineering where they dig into all of these decision points and explain why they are important in the DevOps chain.  His guests alone read like the who's who of the last 30 years of software dev authorship and keynote presentations.  Dr Nicole Forsgren is another key speaker in this area, author of the Accelerate and Frictionless books, co-founder of DORA publishing their State of DevOps' reports for the last decade, former VP of Research at Github and current head of Microsoft's Developer Experience Lab.",

But when the customer comes in and needs their front brakes replaced, you’re not sure what to do.\n\nYou can learn about multimeters and oxygen sensors and oil recyclers and check valves, but none of these help you replace brake pads.

It’s the driest book but the most solid and actionable.\n\nSomeday you will see a problem, and you will know what strategy to apply, and you will say “I wish there was a tool that did X” - and it will be only a few google searches away. There might even be a guide that tells you what settings to use. The new guys will wonder how you brought a toolbox so big; and maybe you have some familiar tools you’ve had for a while, but for the most part you don’t even know a tool exists until you have a problem that needs solving.

Having worked at startups in SI Valley as a dev and in ops I would recommend a different approach.  Startups are working on their next round of financing and have to show immediate progress or the doors will close.  So first off realize you are optimizing for speed and change - I’ve seen startups completely change what product they were offering/making overnight.  So find out what devs are feeling pain over, what is stopping them from changing direction, what is wasting their time - really listen and think deeply. And fix that with automation, changes in process, tooling, and sometimes helping out manually if needed.   Sometimes the best thing you can do is the wrong thing long term.  It won’t matter if the doors close. \n\nI expect to be downvoted. But I stand by this. I’ve worked in fortune 20 companies in devops - startups are a whole different animal.",

One of the players is a saboteur whose goal is to take things down. The rest of the team has to keep production alive and figure out who’s causing the incidents.\n\nThe problem: I’m not a real DevOps engineer. I’m a developer who ends up doing DevOps because the companies I work for are too cheap to hire one. So while I know some pain, I’m very aware I probably don’t know half of it.\n\nFor now, each round spawns a fresh Ubuntu container that represents the company’s main machine. Every player gets a Linux user on that machine. One player is the “manager” with sudo access and decides who gets elevated privileges and when. The system starts in a working state: applications are already running under a process manager (currently PM2), nginx or Apache is preconfigured (based on player choice), DNS is set up, and there’s a mocked certbot-like setup handling SSL. \n\nFor now there are three possible initial system states:\n\n• **“Setup by DevOps”** – everything is where it’s supposed to be (assuming I didn’t mess anything up).  \n• **“Setup by children”** – things mostly work, but there are some mistakes.  \n• **“Setup by a frontend dev”** – everything runs as sudo and nothing is where it’s supposed to be.\n\nThe game features a in game terminal, browser and some unimportant other apps. The player can interact wiht the pages via the ingame browser and with the machine via the ingame terminal or any terminal and ssh to the container.\n\nNow i am at the stage where i need to make tasks, like \"the company changed its name, the website should no longer be [www.company.com](http://www.company.com) but www.newcompany.com\" and the playes should buy the domain (mocked providers), setup the nameservers and dns records and then nginx. Or change the port of the xBackendService to whatever.\n\nAnd this is where I’d really appreciate some help: without making it too daunting or frustrating, and while keeping things balanced for both teams, what other DevOps pain points should I add to keep the authenticity, while still making it somewhat fun? (it's a simulation after all and making it really fun would break the immersion i guess)? \n\nPS: i am not trying to advertise this as i am pretty sure it will never go to market. I'm a nerd and  just enjoy building interesting things for myself, and this turned out to be surprisingly fun to work on.",

Recently, I've been building my own SaaS and micro-SaaS projects using Go (backend) and Angular. It's been a great learning experience, but I’ve noticed that my backends occasionally fail—nothing catastrophic, just small hiccups, occasional 500 errors, or brief downtime.\n\nMy current setup is as basic as it gets: a single VPS running nginx as a reverse proxy, with a systemd service running my Go executable. It works fine for now, but I'm expecting user growth and want to be prepared for hundreds of thousands of users.\n\nMy question is: once you’ve outgrown this simple setup, what’s the logical next step to scale without overcomplicating things? I’m not looking to jump straight into Kubernetes or a full-blown microservices architecture just yet, but I do need something more resilient and scalable than a single point of failure.\n\nWhat would you recommend? I’d love to hear about your experiences and any straightforward, incremental improvements you’ve made to scale your Go applications.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Running 2–3 identical Go instances behind nginx or a managed load balancer gets you a surprising amount of resilience for very little complexity.\n\nAfter that, make failures cheap. Good health checks, fast restarts, and moving state out of the instance (DB, Redis, object storage) matter more than orchestration early on.\n\nI’ve seen teams go very far with “boring” infra once those basics are solid. Kubernetes tends to solve people problems as much as technical ones, and it’s fine to wait until you actually feel that pain.",

Git, folder structure, CODEOWNERS, and PR reviews are table stakes. They solve versioning, access control, and collaboration. They do **not** solve the problem I described.\n\nThe issue I’m asking about is **maintainability at scale**:\n\n* Scripts that start as quick fixes and gradually accrete logic\n* Copy-paste reuse *within* the same repo\n* No clear boundary between “one-off script” and “shared automation”\n* Inconsistent parameters, error handling, logging, and behavior\n* Scripts growing into de facto tools without tests, contracts, or ownership clarity\n\nYou can have all of this **inside a single, well-organized Git repo**.\n\nSo when someone says “just don’t duplicate scripts” or “just put them in Git,” that doesn’t address the core problem. Duplication and entropy don’t happen because Git is missing; they happen because there are no enforced engineering constraints.\n\nWhat I was hoping to hear about are *practices that actually stop entropy*, for example:\n\n* When teams decide a script must become a module\n* How shared logic is enforced (private modules, internal feeds, etc.)\n* CI gates (PSScriptAnalyzer, Pester, style rules)\n* Script lifecycle policies (experimental vs supported vs deprecated)\n* Thresholds where PowerShell is no longer the right abstraction\n* How teams prevent “ops glue” from turning into untestable production code\n\nIf your experience is “we solved this by using Git,” then respectfully, that means you likely haven’t experienced the failure mode I’m describing yet.\n\nI’m interested in answers from environments where PowerShell has lived for years, crossed team boundaries, and accumulated real operational risk and what actually worked (or didn’t) to keep it sane.",

Which from my experience are either something that happens frequently and you want many people to be able to do (specific hygiene tasks for a Dev team for example), or something that has such high impact that not being able to do it at any time will cause significant loss (in revenue) (like recovery from some specific form of outage)\n* And secondly, make sure that budget is allocated for people to maintain the SOPs/Runbooks.\n\nFar too often I see well intentioned people make runbooks for stuff that's incredibly obvious and/or best/common practice. Or things that are so nuanced that it makes no sense as a runbook. Kind of the \"let's document everything anyone could ever do\" mindset, which gives you way too much stuff and most of it never gets used, not to mention: is outdated the moment it's written down since it's too detailed and covers far too much. The other thing I see a lot is that Runbook/SOP creation is seen as a side-task for someone. \"Let's have the developers write it and then the ops team maintain it (whenever they have a moment)\" and in then end these things are 1 written poorly and 2 never updated because people are always busy fixing stuff.\n\nUsually it's a combination of all of the above: no one owns the making and maintaining of this stuff and it gets generated as an unimportant aside.\n\nPersonally I am not convinced of the criticality of runbooks/SOPs in all situations. Like I said I think they need to have significant value AND cover things in a way that doesn't make it outdated basically instantly. If those things are true then there is some incentive to dedicate budget to writing and maintaining them, which needs to be something constant as well. Otherwise, honestly, just using Google and ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini/whatever in a pinch will probably get you out of trouble just the same.",

A well staffed platform team would do this by implementing the operator pattern but with fewer resources this can be at least tacked onto an alerting system: alert detecting condition triggers -> task implementing runbook executes. That at least lets you write tests for the runbook logic, although it’s more brittle than the operator pattern.\n\nOn alerts generally: you never want to be in a place where an alert fires and you know exactly what to do. Alerts should detect unusual situations that require human intervention. If alerts are regularly handled by following rote remediation steps, you need to prioritize fixing the root cause. Of course the real world is messy and this isn’t always practical, but that’s the ideal.",

Six months later it's a graveyard.\n\nThe pattern I've seen work better is tie runbooks directly to incidents and be opinionated. If a runbook only exists in the wiki, it rots. If it gets pulled up every time an alert fires and someone has to actually click through the steps, you find out fast when it's stale. The must all be consistent in their shape/sections too. \n\nThe other thing that helped was recording what actually happened during an incident. Not just following the runbook blindly, but what commands ran, what didn't work, what we improvised. Makes the post-incident update way easier because you're not trying to remember what you did while in the fire.\n\nAutomation is the end goal for anything repetitive, but there's always a gap between \"we should automate this\". A lot of companies will not trust their observability to make decisions on production without a human. I agree that is a great place to get to, but there is a ton of 20 year old services, tech debt, that needs lots of hands...and companies that are willing to pay people to do it. \n\n  \nMy two cents :)",

I did intern with my team before, so I knew what to expect going in.\n\nDuring my internship, I felt so incredibly confused the entire time. During the time between my internship and starting full time, I did some personal projects and filled in some gaps with containerization and other things.\n\nNow that I am full time, I feel like I somewhat know what I'm doing, but I think what gets me is that my team is able to come up with new things to automate, find gaps in things that I don't see, and come up with better solutions with new technologies. I work for a good company, and my team is really smart, so I know if they are willing to have me, I must be okay.\n\nI think what gets me sometimes is the vast amount of knowledge about tons of different things being in DevOps, and not having much of a background in anything else. There is so much to learn - and only over the past few months have I REALLY worked with RHEL, containerization, CI/CD, AWS, and of course our systems we have created. This, and sometimes I get so invested in the tasks themselves, that I can look over small details in PRs, or forgetting to keep up with putting in progress/closing out my Jira stories.\n\nMy team is also extremely organized, and although I find myself to be a very organized person, I feel like I make so many small mistakes during my work. I know I'm only a few months in, but things still take me time and even then, there are so many comments on my PRs. I want to be really good at this, and I really do enjoy it.\n\nIf anyone has any tips as far as organization, dealing with imposter syndrome in this field, and/or gaining confidence in my skills and knowledge, I would love to hear it.\n\nThank you!\n\nEdit: My team is also remote, but they are seemingly very nice despite not getting to know them very well yet.

Be sure to use #<issue\\_number> notations in your commits so you can auto-generate a list of fixed issues to go along with your release notes.\n\nWhen you deploy, send events to your observability systems noting the new version.
