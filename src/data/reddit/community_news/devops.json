Our scale is not that big, but the usage patterns (very fast ramp-up in traffic spikes and a nation-wide streaming service) are similar and we have encountered the same problems.  \n  \nWe minimized the use of NAT-gateways by leveraging transit gateways and avoided the ip-exhaustion by using IPv6. DNS performance has been a problem for us, but we finally fixed it for good by implementing node-local DNS-cache, getting rid of all alpine-images and setting ndots to 3.  \n  \nThe scaling up is still difficult to do fast enough, but by minimizing the size of container images, using fast pull-through caches for them, overprovisioning clusters so there's always free capacity and scaling replicas based on request count instead of CPU, we have managed to make it just fast enough to work 90% of time. We still need to manually scale up the minimum replicas before large events, though.",

Those chunks were published via CDNs to limit our own bandwidth needs. The “list of chunks” was kept current through the CDN with a short TTL.\n\nThe only thing a user had to be connected to us directly for was the DRM. But a single request to that system was good enough for 30 minute chunks, so scaling it was super easy.\n\nWhile there is inherently some delay in this architecture, it was only 30-60s (when I worked there 10 years ago; Maybe less now).",

I know this is bad, and I plan to raise it with leadership.\n\nMy immediate challenge isn’t fixing the org structure overnight, but the fact that we don’t have any process to track:\n\n* who owns a resource\n* why it exists\n* how long it should live (especially non-prod)\n\nThis leads to wasted spend, confusion during incidents, and risky cleanup decisions. SCPs aren’t an option since this is the management account, and pushing everything into member accounts right now feels unrealistic.\n\nFor folks who’ve inherited setups like this:\n\n* What practical process did you put in place first?\n* How did you enforce ownership and expiry without SCPs?\n* What minimum requirements should DevOps insist on?\n* Did you stabilise first, or push early for account separation?\n\nLooking for battle-tested advice, not ideal-world answers 🙂\n\n\n\nEdit: Thank you so much everyone who took time and shared their thoughts. I appreciate each and everyone of them! I have a plan ready to be presented with the management. Let's see how it goes, I'll let you all know how it went, wish me luck :)",

I’m at the tail end of one of these (created the new root org 3.5 years ago) and so far have discovered that \n\n* I won’t be able to migrate rds from the legacy account to the new app-production account while migrating to aurora. \n* Migrating dynamo is also possible but annoying— you have to create IAM permission grants and the application has to assume a role in the old or new account depending on whether the application is migrated before or after dynamo (or if dynamo is ending up in a different account than the application), and it’s likely that these applications have never had to assume a role before and are running some ancient version of boto and no one will ever have time to prioritize fixing it. \n* Migrating secretsmanager objects is very touchy and not trivial to script\n* MWAA does not actually want to work in the recommended best practice account structure (with the VPC shared over RAM from the infrastructure account to the app account) and needs an elaborate event bridge/lambda infrastructure to create vpc endpoints in the infra account\n\nI’m sure that if we were using other services we would have made other discoveries, and I’m sure that if we were using worse IAC (we did 95% of this with crossplane, and only used terraform for the VPC core resources and EKS clusters) like, for example, if we had kept 1 line of the awful horrendous CDK stuff that one of my predecessors tried to deploy, we would have learned other things.\n\nThis is an expensive migration. At the end of it, you will still just have the same capability as before. It will be drastically easier to explain things to auditors, it will be easier to grow in a sane way, your AWS spend will probably be higher at the end but with less waste, it will be safer and better in a dozen other ways that are difficult to quantify, but if your org is not otherwise growing/maturing it will be extremely difficult to explain to management why anyone should be working on this instead of deploying new features. And frankly, unless your org needs to transform for other reasons (growing rapidly, suddenly has more audit compliance needs), it is probably correct that feature development should take priority.",

Tagging will also help you track cloud spend. \n\nBased on that I would say start separating accounts. \n\nDisclaimer, again, I haven’t been in this exact situation, some more experienced folks may have different approaches, but this seems like a practical common-sense approach. ",

If you can separate each environment and their resources by tag, you can then come up with a plan to actually move these into their own accounts.\n\nGiven that everything is running at the company, it'll probably be easier to restrict the permissions when the resources are migrated to the new accounts. You would need to have clarified what permissions each group actually need for these new environments and their accounts. \n\nIn terms of what DevOps should insist on, it really depends on how you maintain all this. Who owns which part of the resources? Is the infrastructure with the software running inside or are they considered separate?\n\nOnce you have different environments tagged at the master account, you can start to import them into IaC. Depending on your design for how to maintain these, it could help to start separating them into different projects per environment at least. Will it be devops doing the whole IaC or are other developers or teams expected to maintain these as well? \n\nIf you want to migrate this into a proper setup, you need management buyin, then you need a way to allow people to make the switch in the \"least\" painful way in order to not have as much push back.",

And use something like CSPM to get independent security scores (hey, boss, we scores 20% on AWS' security best practices, is that ok?).\n\nGood luck! it's been a long road here, and every 2 steps forward are challenged, but we are now mindful of value & security, along with lifecycle. Even if we still have a ton of tech debt, we're making things better faster than were making them worse.",

One in particular resonated with me, it was around providing code validation evidence directly in the PR (partly because the company I work for builds a tool which does just that - mirrord) in other words, \"Show me hard evidence that you validated your finding or feature submission and show me how to reproduce it.\"\n\nNot a silver bullet, but actual code validation is something AI can't fake or do without actually understanding the context and environment the application runs in.",

It allows quickly identifying bottlenecks and issues in requests served with microservice architecture. But the tracing doesn't work in practice on highly loaded systems most of the time, because it generates a ton of data (trace spans), which requires a lot of costs for processing, storing and querying. These costs are usually higher than the costs for the monitored microservices. There are workarounds with various types of sampling for the collected traces (i.e. only a small part of traces are stored and are available for querying and analysts). But the sampling can drop traces for requests you may need to investigate in the future.",

Similar architecture design and implementation issues, mostly because of really bad documentation. Getting your logs archived is a whole month-long project because they have shoehorned you to put everything into a log workspace and use the exporting rules, and those blobs do not even support archiving. Duplicating at the source gets you different formats as now you have three implementations (log export rule, data collection rule and platform logs). It's a fucking mess.\n\nPaid monitoring platforms like Datadog etc. keep shining, but have scummy business practices and know what they have, so you are paying a $$$$$ premium for something that platform-native monitoring solutions could do almost for free while not trying to get fucked over by them which they actively try to do to squeeze money out of you.\n\nPagerDuty I have worked with recently and it's just a complete freaking mess. Undocumented everything, magic everywhere, nothing useful on the important part like getting stuff into the platform in a robust and sane way etc. Even then alert management leave a lot to be desired.\n\n---\n\nAll in all, I believe the only viable, scalable and especially operatable implementation is the classic OSS Grafana+Prometheus+Loki stack with some development and design time under it.",

The problem is when something breaks, you’re staring at data without knowing which change actually mattered. That’s where things get messy. The teams handling this better are closing the gap between code changes and runtime signals. They track not just what failed, but what behavior was introduced. That context comes from understanding PR-level intent, dependencies, and flow changes, not from dashboards. We’ve seen this internally while building CodeAnt AI: when reviewers understand impact upfront (what paths change, which services are touched, what assumptions shift), production observability becomes confirmation, not discovery.\n\nSo in 2026, observability isn’t cleaner tools, it’s fewer unknowns. Less guessing which deploy caused it. Less spelunking. More continuity between code, review, and runtime.",

Now they have changed this strategy, but they moved to a slightly more fair pay for what you use strategy again mostly. Paying for ingest makes sense, however our new issues are with queries. We are now charged for these, a single dashboard for query to try and identify a root cause can go through such a large quantity of data and add up extremely quick. We have tried, but we were given zero ways to optimize these queries as we only ran into their platform limitations and they really just want us to pay. Again as an observability company, they seem to have zero interest in obseravability.  \n\\- Their UI brings even modern PCs to their kness, dashboards being the worst. We also struggled to get it to asign users tot he correct accounts if a user had multiple orgs assigned. So they constantly logged in and saw the wrong data, which was easy to change once they realised, but frustrating  \n\\- Their account managers for our region have all left and we were given an overseas team who simply did not care about our business, only signing the next years contract.\n\nThis is a competitive space, NR seems like they have a lot to offer, but they stopped major innovation a while back, many competitors are hungry for that market share now.",

      "text": "Hey everyone — I few days ago I was told my role is being made redundant, and around 50% of the company is being laid off due to budget cuts. I had a feeling it might be coming, but I didn’t realise things were this bad.\n\nSince 2020 I have just been husting to finish uni, working part time, paying off my debts, and then rushing to crack an interview for my first big boy job and then after 4 years of working I get laid off. I know people have had it much worse but I still feel like crap.\n\nSince getting the news, I’ve been pretty overwhelmed. This was my first proper job after Uni.\n\nI went into full apply and started applying like crazy — tailoring resumes, writing cover letters, the whole lot. I’ve put in 30+ applications in the last 3–4 days. Some roles are a perfect match, others are more like 80% or 60%, and I’m trying to be realistic and apply to adjacent roles too.\n\nBut now I’m hitting a wall — I’m exhausted, and then I feel guilty when I’m not applying. On top of that, seeing 100+ applicants on LinkedIn makes it feel like I’m shouting into the void.\n\nFor those of you who’ve been through layoffs/redundancy before:\n\nIs this “high volume + tailored” approach actually the right move?\n\nHow did you pace yourself without burning out?\n\nAny tips for targeting a niche field (even through you have 60-70% of other skills for other roles) when there just aren’t many openings? \n\nMy work domain is: Kubernetes/HPC/Linux/IaC/Automation...etc etc\n\nWould really appreciate any advice or even just hearing how others are coping. And how long do you set the boundary or the time box? As in how long should I put into the search for the right job (nische field) compared to grabbing whatever I get next. And since im in IT/Tech applications dont get assessed until the applications are closed and then it takes 1-3 weeks for the recruiters to actually get to it.\n\nI wish I had a knob I could turn and fast forward time by a few months.\n\nSorry for the rant and TIA.",

I kept interviewing with other prospects and hooked up with a great position elsewhere and had to resign after only 2 weeks at the defense contractor. Best move but I felt awkward for being on job for 2 weeks and bailing . That next job lasted 4 yrs and propelled me  even higher to my next role, which then propelled me to the one after that.

I gave myself an hour each day to go through applications that were tailored and reaching out to my network to see if anyone was hiring. Imo you should set a timeframe daily/weekly/etc for applications so that you don't burn yourself out. I probably applied to over 200 jobs at the minimum before I found my current job",

Most of those will be speculative and/or poor quality.\n\nDon’t be intimidated by job ads. Try to see past the tone and requirements, and really understand what the hiring company wants and needs. And how that fits with what you can offer.\n\nIf you have the core of what they need, then apply and foreground that experience. Hiring companies will ‘make do’ with people who lack some of what a job ad is asking for, if that person can show/indicate high proficiency in the things that matter. In fact, they may turn down people who can check all the boxes, in favour of someone who is showing higher proficiency in critical areas.\n\nGood luck.

Instead, make sure it's clear that you have _production_ K8s experience, and aren't just someone that's watched a bunch of Youtube videos and is claiming they know what they're doing.\n\n> Any tips for targeting a niche field (even through you have 60-70% of other skills for other roles) when there just aren’t many openings?\n\nAlways remember that job descriptions are the written for the \"ideal/perfect/doesn't actually exist\" candidate. They're not expecting you to have all of those skills (and I would say having 60-70% of the skills is what they're actually looking for). It's more of \"these are the tech stacks you can expect to be eventually responsible for in this role.\"\n\nLikewise, make sure you've got your LinkedIn profile set to \"Open to remote work\" in other cities.\n\nAnother option is to reach out to local recruiters. Only do that if you're desperate, because they're basically glorified sales people that spam LinkedIn and then expect to profit off of your labour for the rest of your contract simply because they arranged an interview for you.\n\nFinally, yes to timeboxing your applications! While you've got the downtime, use this freedom to reboot your physical and mental health. Hit the gym, go for walks, hang with friends.... you'll miss that free time when you land another role.\n\nGood luck, you've got this!",

From what I can tell, it always tend to list 100+ applicants as some sort of bare minimum.  I don't pay attention to it at all.  The only thing I care about is \"freshness\" (older than a month, posted this week) and job match.  I don't consider LinkedIn to be too bad since 1) that's where I got my last job that I was laid off from and worked the past 4 years and 2) while I'm getting fast rejections I AM getting responses (and thus, likely legitimate job postings).\n\nIf you only found out a few days ago, then I'm not sure why you'd get discouraged right off the bat.  I've always found jobs around 1 month after I started job hunting in the past, but I consider those good times when the job market was stronger.  I wouldn't find it beyond the ordinary for a job search in today's market to take 3+ months.\n\nSince I did get the opportunity to play a DevOps Engineer on TV, I've integrated AI into various parts of my workflow (using Firecrawl MCP to scrape ATS and job boards, using chrome-devtools MCP to scrape LinkedIn/Indeed/Glassdoor/Builtin, tailoring resumes with python-docx).  Most of my effort is spent filtering out bad matches, and I'm averaging 7+ job applications per week.\n\nIf I'm not applying for jobs or tuning my AI-workflow, then I'm spending my time learning Golang.  If I get done with that, then I'll brush up on Bash/Python.  If I'm done with that, maybe I'll take the CKA.\n\nMy time is either spent:\n\n1. Searching for and applying to jobs.\n\n2.

You’re gonna cut your salary in half like you said.\n\nI’m working on artistic stuff; voice acting. Who knows if it will work out but I am just going to do what I love. I hope you find what that is and do it too.\n\nIf you have any questions lmk. am open to discuss.",

What is the **industry-standard way** to install Argo CD?\n   * Terraform Kubernetes provider?\n   * Ansible?\n   * Or just a simple `kubectl apply` / bash script?\n2.

That gets the Kubernetes cluster up. For the first time install of Argo CD we use a Helm chart, sometimes Terraform's Helm provider but often it is a manual apply because it only happens once at cluster bootstrapping. After that Argo CD manages everything else including itself via its own manifests in a GitOps repo. If we need to upgrade Argo CD or roll out a new version we update the Git repo and let Argo CD reconcile itself. Ansible did not really fit into the pipeline once we committed to everything living in the cluster. It is more for legacy VM config or when we need to do something directly on a node for weird edge cases. As for plugin installs we do the same thing, define it in Git and let Argo CD roll it out alongside everything else. In production I have seen that once Argo CD is there you do not want to mix too many config tools anymore. Makes life easier to keep that boundary clean.",

If not, ArgoCD is just going to add noise.  The nice thing about terraform is the ease in which you can destroy resources. I can use Ansible to provision my cloud resources pretty easily. But then have to write almost as many plays in reverse order to destroy those resources.  But if your team is good at Ansible, then it’s really a non-issue.  I can write a local provisioner in terraform but if my team doesn’t know HCL what’s the value? \n\nWe’ve had different professional services teams try and sell their best idea of provisioning and it all falls on deaf ears if it’s just one more thing the team needs to learn.  At the end of the day, provisioning clusters probably isn’t making the company any money.   Get them built as quick as possible the best way you know how and focus on whatever makes the company money.  Oh, and security…",

      "text": "I’ve been seeing way too many “AI has ruined coding forever” posts on Reddit lately, and I get why people feel that way. A lot of us learned by struggling through docs, half-broken tutorials, and hours of debugging tiny mistakes. When you’ve put in that kind of effort, watching someone get unstuck with a prompt can feel like the whole grind didn’t matter. That reaction makes sense, especially if learning to code was tied to proving you could survive the pain. \n\nBut I don’t think AI ruined coding, it just shifted what matters. Writing syntax was never the real skill, thinking clearly was. AI is useful when you already have some idea of what you’re doing, like debugging faster, understanding unfamiliar code, or prototyping to see if an idea is even worth building. Tools like Cosine for codebase context, Claude for reasoning through logic, and ChatGPT for everyday debugging don’t replace fundamentals, they expose whether you actually have them. Curious how people here are using AI in practice rather than arguing about it in theory.",

Where in many cases they lean too heavily on ai to code things for them to the point where they’re not actively learning/coding as much as they perhaps should in order to advance their career and grow in the profession. \n\n\nNow as far as jobs go in mid to senior levels, I think ai has increased efficiency and in a way helped businesses somewhat eliminate positions for jr/level 1 engineers as level 2s, 3s etc can make great use of ai to quickly scaffold out or outright fix minor issues that perhaps otherwise they’d give to a jr dev - atleast this is what I’ve seen locally with some companies around me.

But this raises the question which tools and techniques help us think clearly, and how we can clearly communicate the result of that thinking.\n\n\nProgramming languages are tools for thinking about designs, often with integrated features like type systems that highlight contradictions.\n\n\nIn contrast, LLMs don't help to think better or faster, but they're used for outsourcing thinking. For someone who's extremely good at reviewing LLM output that might be a net positive, but I've never met such a person.\n\n\nIn practice, I see effects like confirmation bias degrade the quality of LLM-\"assisted\" thought work.

I can spend a couple of days writing Ansible yaml to configure some systems or I can spend a couple hours thinking it through, creating an instructions file and other supporting documentation for AI to do it for me.

Using AI to find solutions takes away the part of the work I actually enjoy, and leaves me with only the parts I hate.

If I need something larger, I’m going to spend all my time reading through whatever the AI output to make sure it’s what I’m looking for, and to confirm that it hasn’t hallucinated a bunch of arguments that don’t actually exist. To me, that is far less interesting than actually putting things together myself. I can see where the efficiency gains come from, but for me, it takes away the only reasons I can tolerate being in this field.

I’ve been in the cloud space for about a year now, and overall I have around 5–6 years of IT experience.\n\nIn the cert side, i have AZ-900, AZ-104, AZ-305, and AZ-400\n\nIn my current role I worked my way up to a medior level, but my real goal is to move into DevOps. I know that means I need solid Docker and Kubernetes knowledge, so I’ve started learning and practicing them in my limited free time. I’ve even built some small projects already.\n\nThe problem is that my current salary is around standard market level, which is great, but when I apply for DevOps roles, I usually run into two outcomes:\n\n1, I don’t even get invited to an interview,\n\n2, I get an interview, but they offer me about half my current salary because they would hire me as a junior DevOps engineer due to my lack of hands-on experience with Docker and Kubernetes.\n\nRight now I simply can’t afford to cut my salary in half. On top of that, my current company doesn’t really use Docker or Kubernetes, so I don’t have the chance to gain real work experience with them.\n\nI know the market is shit for switching jobs right now, but living in a country where salaries are already much lower than in most of Europe makes this even more frustrating. Honestly, it’s hard to see a clear way forward.\n\nWhat would you do in my situation? How would you successfully pivot into DevOps without taking such a big financial step back? Any advice would be really appreciated.",

You should be able to say what you accomplished with the languages, tools, and technologies you've used \n\n2 - IT in an enterprise environment doesn't have a \"new tool every year\", but actually the technologies tend to stick around.

Learn how Devops aims to improve software delivery. Leverage your experience of managing multiple cloud tenancies with guardrails etc into managing multiple teams or programs of devs in Github or Gitlab etc. Or for cutting edge, learn how to support dev teams into agentic AI development, and what kinds of guardrails you can put in place for companies. Learn how to bake security into software development rather than tacking it on later.\n\nYeah, that learning that stuff is going to be hard without some exposure to developers, software development and being able to speak their language.

So my suggestion would be to not fixate so hard on the title, but the pay of it.\n\nYou already have strong experience and nice certifications. Get CKA and CKS maybe and you'll learn what you need about Kubernetes. Knock out Terraform Associate, it's pretty easy cert and with your experience you should get it in no time. \n\n  \nWhat I'm saying is look what's out there, As others have said you are already doing 80% of what a DevOps is and that's just a title with different responsibilites and meaning in each company.

After a lot of hours I've managed to create a directory of 1028 opensource software.\n\nI've seen multiple other sites which have the same premise and all the GitHub Awesome Lists, but they lack in identifying if the repo is active, abandoned or just the general consensus of the OSS they have listed, the upvote system on this directory should really help show which OSS excel. I'm also working a deeper categorization system which shows alerts and highlights about the repos status , eg. whether the project is experimental, buggy/unstable, has a restrictive license or corporate influence.\n\nI've added a submission system so you opensource developers out there can list your projects.",

Consider writing up the reasons why you think Pulumi could be a better choice for the project, make sure they are tied to business outcomes, and ideally set some expectations or measurements.\n\nSome common reasons our customers say they like using Pulumi:\n\n- Faster time to market with Pulumi (that is, they can get infra launched faster) b/c of the use of general purpose languages\n- Displeasure with how HashiCorp, an IBM Company canceled CDKTF with zero advance notice, pricing changes, etc.\n- Cross-language interoperability with Pulumi components (may not be applicable on a smaller-scale project)\n\nResume-driven development burns bridges and is short-sighted. This would also create a bad impression of Pulumi as a tool in your org, and I don't want that as a Pulumi employee.\n\nI would _not_ recommend using Ansible for infrastructure because there are much more capable tools out there, but Ansible is really nice if you need to do configuration management.\n\nYou can join our Community Slack if you need support while learning Pulumi: https://slack.pulumi.com",

It's exciting to see more companies evaluating modern infrastructure options and thinking critically about what works best for their teams.\n\nI agree that the \"right\" answer really depends on your team's background and what stage you're at. The Terraform vs Pulumi debate often comes down to whether you prefer HCL's declarative constraints or the flexibility of real programming languages. Both have their place\n\nYour point about PaaS solutions for early-stage teams makes total sense. We're seeing this a lot at Render too, teams that want to ship features fast without becoming infrastructure experts first. You get managed databases, auto-scaling, and built-in security without writing any IaC at all. Then as you grow and your needs get more specific, you can always add infrastructure-as-code on top or migrate to something more complex.\n\nThe Kubernetes-native tools you mentioned (Crossplane, ACK, etc.) are interesting for teams already committed to K8s, but that's a pretty heavy lift if you're just trying to get an app in front of users\n\nWhat infrastructure approach are you all currently using, and what's been the biggest pain point?",

          "text": "tldr: if it's a startup, just use OpenTofu since future devops people will want it. Neither option is that wrong, though Pulumi might run out of funding faster than OpenTofu perhaps in a decade from now. That's too long to consider though. For what it's worth, both can reap the benefits of Claude Code just fine, so my advice is OpenTofu if you want to scale and definitely use AI (so long as you know what you're doing on paper and not just blindly letting Claude Code make services).\n\nI'm just now learning TF/OpenTofu but I started with Pulumi for a project because I heard loops were a nightmare in TF. I had a good understanding of AWS/GCP (where I used both and also needed to deploy to Oracle), and Claude Code helped me code the majority of the infra in Pulumi. I wouldn't say there were any bugs with Pulumi rather lots of niche, unknown AWS things that I couldn't figure out.\n\nI will say: Claude Code can be your friend for either option but only if you know all the basics of the AWS services and can choose which services to use by yourself without AI. Otherwise, it might hallucinate a little.\n\nI do think Pulumi offers something that made it appealing for a consulting shop making on-prem deployments on behalf of customers which was the Pulumi Automation API.\n\nI'm now learning TF and seeing if Claude Code works for it for a startup that doesn't need to deploy en masse and customized per customer, just normal service deployments. I think 95% of startups don't have a need that makes Pulumi worth it over TF.\n\nIf long-term alive-ness is the concern, and you don't have a need for the Automation API, then I would just use TF/OpenTofu because DevOps folks for hire generally only want to deal with TF since they're used to it. Obviously, your code base will be a mess since you're new, but folks you eventually hire tend to always fix things in subjective ways.\n\nWith all those Pulumi employees out on Reddit, I would assume one reads this, but having Pulumi infer what the problem is using an AI would be helpful. AWS doesn't give proper error messages, so you have to ask around and infer based on past issues why AWS is not working. But for what it's worth, Pulumi itself was never a problem.\n\nI will say the Pulumi slack is decently helpful. The community helped me figure out all those AWS issues and some Pulumi beginner issues. Just takes a few hours fwiw.",

Pipelines may look “green,” but latency, outages, and bottlenecks still happen — and people who only know tools struggle to debug them.\n\nI’m not saying Dev isn’t important. I’ve worked on CI/CD deeply enough to know how complex it is.\n\nBut in most real environments, weak infrastructure eventually limits everything built on top.\n\nDevOps shouldn’t start with “how do we deploy?”\n\nIt should start with “how stable is the system we’re deploying onto?”\n\nCurious how others here see it.\n\n",

A CS degree probably gave you solid fundamentals architecture, networking, OS concepts, etc. Also, plenty of DevOps engineers don’t work in the cloud at all.\n\nYou already have Linux and Bash, which is a strong base. Cloud is mostly just another abstraction layer: permissions become IAM, VMs become Compute Engine/EC2, and so on.\n\nBefore you jump into certifications, I’d honestly build a small homelab. Install Proxmox, then set up a few things, for example:\n\n\t•\ta NAS VM for storage\n\n\t•\tVMs for a Docker host, LDAP, Pi-hole\n\n\t•\ton the Docker host: Jellyfin/Plex, whatever you actually use\n\nOnce you’ve done it manually, you’ll naturally want to automate it. Start with templates, then move to Ansible + Git. Later you can replace more and more with Terraform (or at least use IaC principles), and you’ll learn the concepts way deeper.\n\nWhy? Because you’ll hit the same problems as in the cloud, just on a smaller scale:\n\n\t•\thow to manage access across machines\n\t•\thow to provision machines faster\n\t•\thow to optimize resources\n\t•\thow to standardize setups\n\nAnd yeah, you’ll probably end up writing some custom Python scripts once you start seeing opportunities.\n\nAI will replace “clickers.” I’ve met people who’ve been in cloud roles for years and still can’t do the basics underneath. And some companies will test that (e.g., “set up LDAP” or similar tasks), even if the job is cloud-heavy.\n\nInternal transfer is honestly one of the best paths so go for it like you said. Once your fundamentals and concepts are solid, then start learning Azure.",

          "text": "Transitioning from manual testing into DevOps is very doable, and you’re already ahead in several areas. Manual testers often have a solid grounding in quality thinking, which aligns really well with DevOps because you’re already focused on finding issues early and improving reliability that’s a mindset, not just a job title.\n\nA few practical ways people make this transition smoothly:\n\n1) Leverage what you already know  \nYour Python, Linux, and shell scripting skills are real assets, they’re exactly the kind of automation foundation DevOps looks for. Many testers begin by automating test suites in CI/CD pipelines and that naturally evolves into owning delivery pipelines.\n\n2) Start with automation + CI/CD projects  \nSet up a small project (even on your own) that:\n\n* Builds via GitHub Actions/CI on every commit\n* Runs automated tests\n* Deploys to a staging environment That gives you practical pipeline experience interviewers love to see.\n\n3) Learn cloud and IaC incrementally  \nYou don’t need to know everything at once, focus on one cloud (AWS, Azure, or GCP depending on your company) and get comfortable with basic services + how to automate their provisioning (Terraform or managed stacks).\n\n4) Use your testing background as leverage  \nInstead of starting from scratch, frame your QA experience as quality assurance in delivery , DevOps values people who understand how to prevent regressions and improve pipeline confidence.\n\nOne pattern I see in successful transitions is turning every manual step you currently do into an automated, observable step ,that’s literally what modern DevOps delivery systems are built on. Once you have even a couple of proofs of work (GitHub repo, pipeline examples), internal transfers and interviews become much more straightforward.",

Users getting 5xx errors is always a problem.\n\nWe break it into three tiers. Page someone when users are affected right now. Slack notification when something needs attention today like a cert expiring in 14 days. Just log it when it's interesting but not urgent.\n\nThe other thing that took us years to learn is that if an alert fires and we consistently do nothing about it, we delete the alert. Alert fatigue is real and it makes you ignore the alerts that actually matter.\n\nWrote up the full 10-layer framework we use covering everything from infrastructure to log patterns. Each layer exists because we missed it once and got burned.\n\n[https://tasrieit.com/blog/10-layer-monitoring-framework-production-kubernetes-2026](https://tasrieit.com/blog/10-layer-monitoring-framework-production-kubernetes-2026)\n\nWhat's your approach to deciding what gets a page vs a notification?",

I was recently (last month) offered a staff platform engineer position for 210k base comp. That seemed to be their high end too. You can definitely get there if you factor in 401k match/RSUs/bonus, but I’m not sure given the uncertainty of AI if I’d be willing to be someone making above the high end of the salary for an engineering job right now. The field is also getting more and more competitive at the high end, as there’s less emphasis on places to higher junior engineers anymore. If you really practice on what you wanna say in interviews and speak succinctly and confidently, at the staff level that will sell people. They want people who are self-motivated and can handle difficult projects without having to babysit. You also have to be great at working with other teams and working in areas you or no one else at the company may know and quickly become an expert at it. At this level it’s also how well you can market an idea and get other teams on board.",

      "text": "I worked as a frontend developer until last June. A friend told me about a devops opening in his Fortune 500 department. I wasn't interested at first because I preferred coding over managing Docker or K8s, but the salary hike and the big company experience were too good to pass up. He also persuaded me that they were using relatively new technologies and doing devops do no harm to my career. I almost missed the deadline, but the manager reopened the application just for me, which put a lot of pressure on me not to embarrass my friend during the hiring process.\n\nI heard from my friends that the current tech stack includes Sitecore, Azure, Cloudflare, Kubernetes, Docker, and SQL. They also used Terraform extensively. Since I had zero professional devops experience, I had to cram knowledge in two weeks. I would say for people like me AI would help a lot. I use Claude and Beyz coding assistant to help me understand complex concepts. Even with all that, I still had no confident in the interview. However, the actual interview was unexpected. The manager didn't do any code test and ask technical questions. He focused entirely on personality check, which is a little weird but after working with him for months I think it’s quite his personality. I think interview patterns totally depend on interviewers’ preference because the manager of another group require two code tests. When he asked what I value most, I told him about my learning trajectory: I went from a Chemistry degree to a Master’s in Power Electronics, then a second Master’s in Power Systems, and finally became a coder. I explained that switching fields and picking up new stacks is my core strength. I told him that I’m a quick study, but I’m definitely not into socializing. He gave a slow nod and just said \"Good\". After the interview, I just went back to my daily work. I didn't really expect much since I was honest about having zero experience. But I got the offer two days latter.\n\nNow that I’ve been on the job for about 6 months. I spent the early months learning while working, now I'm a little more comfortable. Unlike Frontend, where work ends when you close your IDE, DevOps is tied to release windows. Most of our releases happen after 7 PM. I do K8s cluster upgrades at midnight, which is a massive shift in work-life balance. For those who transitioned from Frontend to DevOps, I'd love to hear your reasons for making the jump and how you're feeling about the change now. ",
