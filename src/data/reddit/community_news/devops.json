It’s incredibly frustrating because, in the real world, I would just check the `man` page or the docs in five seconds. I’ve architected scalable clusters and debugged complex race conditions at 3 AM, but apparently, none of that matters if I don't have the documentation memorized. It feels like we are being tested on our ability to be a dictionary rather than our ability to be engineers who solve problems.\n\nI wish more interviewers would actually test how I think. Ask me how I’d debug a 500 error on a Friday night or how I’d design a rollback strategy; don't ask me for a flag I’ve aliased in my `.bashrc` for three years.\n\nWhat is the most ridiculous \"trivia\" question you've ever been asked that had absolutely nothing to do with your actual ability to do the job?\n\nFor candidates who want to prepare beyond command-line trivia, this breakdown on real-world [DevOps interview questions](https://www.netcomlearning.com/blog/devops-interview-questions) highlights the skills employers should actually be evaluating.  \n",

Communicating that you understand the fundamental concepts and available tools which can do a job for you is more important than understanding that you can Google stuff and save what you found on stack overflow in an alias.\n\nAddressing OP's stated circumstance, an interviewer asking for specific flags is coming at it the wrong way. They should be asking about process and determining whether you have the core knowledge required instead of specifics and minutiae like flags. But some interviews are going to be shitty. When they are, pivoting directly to process is a better answer than just \"I use aliases\" and waiting for the interviewer to prompt you for more info.",

So they default to memorization.\n\nAlso, if that’s how they interview, that’s probably how they operate. Lots of gatekeeping, not a lot of engineering.\n\nOnly time CLI stuff makes sense is junior-ish and even then it should be fundamentals, not trivia. Like… explain stdin/stdout/stderr, pipes, exit codes, basic text processing, and how you’d find the answer when you don’t know. That’s way more realistic than “what’s the 3rd flag on tar I haven’t used since 2014.”\n\nRidiculous one I got once… “recite the exact rsync flags to do a dry run with delete and preserve perms” …as if `--help` doesn’t exist.",

It was an open office anyway and they had put the engineering/ops team in between sales and marketing so in between the sales bros and the marketing ladies it was a kind of loud environment that I was frankly not suited for anyway. I do better in a quiet environment surrounded by developers or engineers, or working remotely so I wasn't unhappy to move on. There were some kind of strange personalities in that place.

I need to work on my communication skills, especially how to clearly explain the concept and drive the conversation. The god thing is that there were using fireflies service which records entire interview and provide feedback with full conversation, immediately after i got rejection mail.\n\n**Reason for Rejection:**  \nThey want someone who can speak fluent English.\n\n**CI/CD & Version Control**\n\n* Which software do you use as a reverse proxy?\n* How would you rate yourself in GitLab CI/CD out of 10?\n* What are artefacts in GitLab CI/CD?\n* You mentioned GitLab CI/CD and GitHub Actions in your resume:\n* What is the key difference between GitLab CI/CD and GitHub Actions?\n* What is the difference between Git, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI/CD?\n\n**AWS, Hosting & Deployment**\n\n* Have you hosted or deployed any Node.js projects on AWS (EC2 or other AWS services)?\n* Scenario question: Suppose there is one backend Node.js service running in Docker on an EC2 instance.\n* How would you set up an SSL certificate for it?\n* How would you generate the SSL configuration file?\n* Explain the SSL concept and why SSL is required.\n* Have you set up any AWS database services like RDS or Aurora?\n* Migration experience: You mentioned migrating Bitbucket projects to an on-prem GitLab server:\n* What migration strategy did you follow?\n* How did you plan and execute the migration?\n* Have you worked with database migrations using CI/CD pipelines (automated DB migrations)?\n\n**Docker & Containers**\n\n* Write a Dockerfile for a Node.js application using:\n* NPM as the package manager\n* Port 3000\n* What is the difference between ENTRYPOINT and CMD in Docker?\n\n**Frontend, Serverless & CDN**\n\n* Which frontend technologies have you hosted on Firebase?\n* React only?\n* Next.js as well?\n* Have you deployed any applications using AWS Lambda?\n* AWS Lambda limitation question: Lambda has a package size limit. If node\\_modules exceeds the limit, how would you solve it?\n* Difference between EC2 and serverless services like AWS Lambda.\n* What is cold start in AWS Lambda?\n* How does a CDN work?\n* Can only images and videos be cached in a CDN, or can other content be cached too?\n* What are edge servers in a CDN?\n\nEDIT: used chatgpt to format questoins topic wise and to currect english words",

How do you like them apples?” and gave me full FinOps responsibilities.\n\nNow this is a completely new world for me. I used to work on scaling behavior, instance types, cluster efficiency, etc. Now I’m expected to have an opinion on how much we should commit, how to model future usage, how to balance flexibility vs discounts, how to talk to finance...\n\nIt’s a different muscle entirely and doesn't feel like my forte.\n\nSo while I'm reflecting on the mistakes that led me here, I've got a couple of questions for anyone who made the jump from pure DevOps into FinOps territory: \n\nWhere did you start?\n\nAny hard lessons you can help me avoid?\n\nAny blog/podcast/book I should watch/read/listen to?",

A big part of this isn't just \"save money\" - it's effectively communicating how much is being spent on what and presenting the trade-offs for cost savings (cheaper VMs may slow developers down, but that could actually be the right business decision in some scenarios, even though the Devs might hate it).",

Find out from management how important each part of your systems are - from highly critical (can't trade without it) to medium (affects business growth or long term stability if it's down for a while) to low (not much impact if it's broken for a while). Ensure that management do give you that information, do not accept them dodging it. \n\nThen develop some plans and policies. Policies like what you will do for particular levels of business risk (e.g. you'll have 3-way redundant production and 2-way redundant development, or whatever). Those are what you will point to if someone questions your recommendations, because you'll be taking the business management definitions of how important a product  or service is and using your policies to specify how much technical quality to provide.\n\nFinancial people know how to model money and spending. You know how more money buys more flexibility, removes more risk, and increases reliability.  Put those together with what reliability and flexibility the business wants and you get your recommended spending. \n\nBuild automation to check that actual service configurations match the reliability demands - including not enough being spent to match the needs.\n\nAll of that put together will put you in good shape without having to either make business decisions or having people constantly arguing what you say.

You could get included into budget meetings and management meetings for operation cost etc. and can easily get recognised for even higher roles. \n\nTo start i would recommend see everything as a source to optimise cost, firstly by understanding what brings in cost. Datadog to manage and data for your system's APIs and you can provide a cost break-down for each and every API you process via process time x total month process time/total compute cost. provide storage and data cost etc.   \nLook into cost-reliablility ratios such as how important certain things need to be provided a larger instance that will more likely crash like flink connectors that get sudden large amounts of data. what happens if you provide a smaller buffer before autoscaling 60% vs 80%.   \nDiscounts depending on what you use but pretty straight forward cause azure and aws have the Reserved instance calculators you can just use. \n\nBiggest thing i did was just looking at the AWS Bill and going item by item and figuring why it needs to be what it is, and what is causing that cost. E.G. EFS was in the thousands from storing cache from a system that only needed 3 days of cache but was stored indefinitely.   \nSome higher level items could be the allocation of region specific services and the data transfer cost between the servers that could become a issue where you save alot if you break down your data store into region reducing latency and AZ and regional transfer cost.",

          "text": "Always do the math out. You should be spending some time in Excel every day even if it's just to make yourself familiar with the tools. You need to figure out how to predict the changes that different contract terms will make on what you're going to pay for a certain level of use, and you need to game out likely changes in use levels. \n\nA good example of why this is important is that AWS usually offers private pricing on atypical services that not everyone uses, like their speech to text transcription service. Some of them are astoundingly good, to the point where it's worth it to sign up a little higher than your current use because paying the penalty for under-use is *still* cheaper than paying the retail rate for the usage. \n\nThe other thing that usually trips people up is seasonality. most businesses have seasonality in some form, e.g. December is dead or there's a sharp peak at Thanksgiving. Figuring out what your seasonality is and writing contracts so that you're not penalized for your peaks or valleys is important. One of the tricks I'd use with AWS is to change the period for the penalties, e.g. since we had dead spots in July and December I'd ask that our penalties would be calculated for quarterly use or annual use if I could get it instead of monthly use. \n\nThe third is to figure out what the business actually wants. The priority for the CFO is usually not going to be cost *reduction*, it's going to be keeping cloud costs *consistent* and smoothing out any peaks or valleys. But not all finance departments are the same, so you have to ask, and asking this question will often automatically get you a lot of political capital with the finance team. Asking to involve them in PPA negotiations can also help everyone out. \n\nAnd now that I've mentioned it, your most valuable resource in this kind of role isn't technical skill or accuracy. It's political capital. You need to learn how to manage it, which doesn't always mean hoarding it like a dragon.",

          "text": "You'll get a lot of very finops oriented answers, I have a slightly different take from my experience going from purely devops / sre to managing the AWS budget. Hoping my experience might apply here, but it's mostly going to be SaaS focused.  \n\nCost optimizations is like any other optimization problem. Except it's a lot easier to measure, and if you make an impact, and also it's a lot easier for the business to appreciate it.   \n\nNot sure what your leadership expects, sounds like there wan't anyone looking at your cloud bill before. That's like running a service without monitoring, the moment you turn that on you'll find a lot of things to improve.   Hopefully you are not under pressure to reduce your bill significantly immediately.   \n\nYou have one benefit here that most pure finops folk don't have: You know what the systems that are running are, and how they operate. You will look at your bill and see things that make no sense: Focus on those.   \nYour are paying for lots of s3 requests instead of cloudfront? Figure out where that is happening in your app. You'll save money and give your customers a better experience.   \nYour ec2 cost is flatter than you would expect? Go adjust your autoscaling.   \nWait, we are not using service X, why are we paying for it? Go clean that shit up.  \nSpending too much in Dynamo transactions? Go reserve some.   \n\nDoing that is important for a few things:\n1. They are a lot more tangible if you come from devops land\n2. You will quickly learn what costs you have control of, and what is just the cost of running your business (that you'll want to commit to, via reserved instances, savings plans, etc). \n3. Optimizing something and not being able to realize savings because you committed first sucks, or worse: you stop looking for improvements because there is no upside\n4. It will help you familiarize yourself with the tooling. And how pricing works\n\nWhile you do that, celebrate those improvements. Post your cost reports trending down and to the right to your leadership.\n\n\nThe second half of the work, involves spreadsheets... a lot of spreadsheets. But ultimately, in most cases, is a question of risk management:\n1. Am I going to need this data if I move it to glacier?\n2. Is a new instance type going to be released that will make more financial sense than staying on a reservation for the old gen. \n3. Are my compute costs going to remain in this level , go up or go down?\n\nIt's very tempting to overanalize to try to get to the optimal number of how much you should reserve / commit. I've been there done that, saved a bunch of money.  \nBut as I say before: this is a risk management game.   \nYou could do a compute savings plan and commit to what you think is the optimal $ ammount for 3 years for that sweet 50% discount.  \nBut you'll be in a lot better position if you commit 1/3 of that for 3 years the first year, another the next, and again thr following year. (You might want to throw some 1yr commits in there too).  \n\nWhat I'm trying to say here is (if you can) don't be afraid to start small. See what impact you have (I've been hit by unexpected things more than once). Once you feel comfortable, and are more familiar with the risks, making decisions get easier, and the bussiness will trust you to make them. \n\nAnd when you do, let people know how much they are saving. Look back after a year and see what your work saved you. Celebrate that shit.  Because next year's budget already assumes you'll do at least as good, and no one will thank you for that again.",

IF the security team's leadership is likely be cooperative. Your manager probably has some intuitions about whether or not that is the case.  \n\nThe framing I like around this stuff is that there are two categories of security failure.  \n\n1. Security too weak. Attacker gets in.  \n\n2. Security policies contain unnecessary complexity. Work is prevented from being completed, the entire purpose of running a company. (This also leads to people trying to get around the polices, making the org less secure anyway)\n\nBoth types of failure are very severe and great effort should be expended to avoid either.

That isn't security, those are just glorified sysadmins spinning up software, throwing the results at other departments and not generating any benefit/value for the company (either because they are incompetent, or because management decided to get a bunch of junior level knowledge people; you get what you pay for).\n\n> I'm supposed to drop whatever sprint work I'm on, research the CVE, find where we use that package, assess actual risk, test the upgrade, and hope nothing breaks.\n\nI'm mostly with you here, security team should definitely have provided a list of impacted applications/modules/libraries, checked if the CVE is even potentially relevant (e.g. affects LDAP but it is known the application doesn't use LDAP), provided an initial impact or risk assessment (which then transfers to \"what priority does this ticket even have\"), scope, potential mitigations aside from \"update the dependency\". Also may need to translate CVE speak into developer speak. \n\nActual risk is then decided together with the developers since they know the application logic and dependency usage, while we (security) can provide details on the vulnerability.\n\nEach company and applications are different, but for me it is very rare for a CVE to be \"this is urgent enough to need to be taken care of today\" with no alternative temporary mitigations available to reduce the risk.\n\n> Why can't these tools give actual context? Like this package is used in auth flow, vulnerability allows account takeover, here's how to fix it. Instead of just screaming CVE numbers at me.\n\nSounds like the tool they are using is working with a software bill of materials and not the code itself (e.g. DependencyTrack). Or the software technically could do it as part of the Software Composition Analysis, but the feature is locked behind a higher cost tier that what they are paying (e.g. Sobarqube). Again you get what you pay for.\n\nAs a bare minimum I'd suggest your manager pushes for the the security team to include the full CVSS scoring, an impact analysis written by the security team in the context of the business, and for the security team to implement a proper ASPM to generate actional tasks and not just CVE checkboxes.",

That's an important distinct, risk needs to be treated, not fix.\n\nFixing code and determining what's relevant or not for the application isn't security's job, they don't have the skills set. I've seen senior security guys that can't read a git diff. On the web mind you, not on the CLI. So asking devs to go to mitre or just google with the CVE identifier isn't unreasonable, it's a decent identifier that will give you all the info you need to fix (again, assuming it's not outputting all issues without priority).\n\n  \nMain bit: the tool is just one part of the solution.

For a while we were even told we cannot have any vulnerabilities of any severity on anything. Thankfully there was such a massive uproar to the stupidity of that request that they changed it to no critical or highs. Which is still a stupid policy because it's a blanket rule without any context or assessment into actual risk to any of our actual products.\n\n\nI honestly don't know what happened, but it used to be more reasonable where you'd assess risk and then if it was determined there was no real risk. You just had to write a quick little justification. Send it off to the security team and they would approve exemptions. Now. They seem to refuse to approve any exemptions no matter what for any reason. \n\nI brought this up with my manager about how much of a massive waste of time this is and how it's completely insane and crippling us. I was told that they understand and they agree but that it's out of their hands. It's coming from a much higher level. I was literally told that it does not matter what the cost or consequences are.

It includes pretty good reachability analysis and the sast severity errs on the side of not being too sensationalist. Can highly recommend it vs the other tools I've evaluated. Automated tickets are created for anything that's reachable above high severity, and the tooling does a good job with it. I review all tickets before assigning them to a team, and have a Slack bot that informe me or every new vuln.\nThe reachability analysis requires zero setup, but it will miss things and can't evaluate every eco system / package whatever.

Someone can do that when thinking solely about the above, but that usually means missing the big picture of context, which means you get solutions that aren't always matching up with a developer wants or needs.\n\nA junior devops turned into devops in my experience often turns into \"not my problem, here is a log that is 99% filled with nothing related, parse that log and fix it\" type of interaction. A developer turned devops turns into \"I saw this issue, I think it's this from the log, I suspect I can fix it on my end doing x/y, but it would likely be better if y'all did z instead\". That's also someone developers then appreciate and are willing to compromise with much faster, because the developers trust that person to have taken their side into account and how it fits into the big picture.\n\nAnd yes, to fufil that kind of role is hard, that's why good devops people are paid very well. They are both rare, and took a very long time to get to that point in their skills.",

          "text": "I learned it basically as a vocation. I've been a computer nerd since the age of 5. Started a web hosting biz in high school, which exposed me to enterprise grade infrastructure. With the experience I already had, I was hired as the IT director of the independent student newspaper in college for all 4 years (a legit business, with half a million $ revenue each year and 100 business and editorial staff in the office between 9am - 4am, 5 days per week). I had free reign to do whatever improvements I wanted to the infrastructure - workstations and servers/network/storage - that I wanted, as long as the systems were up and healthy. So that was basically my personal lab to experiment with and learn.\n\nI worked as a systems engineer after graduation, gradually working on larger systems in a datacenter. I learned a ton about infrastructure, which I really enjoy because systems engineering is basically about making all the different pieces of infra work together , and build a system that does things.\n\nI taught myself to program as a kid and honed my skills throughout college and after. I got my foot in the door as a devops engineer at my 3rd professional job and started with some crappy AWS systems that me and my teammate slowly built out using best practices and terraform. Thats how I learned about infra automation and deployment pipelines. \n\nIn summary, I learn best by working on projects, which involve making multiple different parts work together. Code is the glue that ties everything together and automates it. I hate classroom learning because it is boring. Project work gives me great satisfaction because I have an end creation that works and does things, that I can feel proud of.\n\nI have taught some of my friends how to transition to devops/SRE work, by assigning them this project:\n\n* Sign up for a free AWS account.\n* Write a simple software service in your language of choice. Maybe a python flask application that serves a simple user signup and login form and an API with /user and /auth endpoints. Then create 2 microservices  to handle user creation (CRUD - create, read, update, delete) and login (validates username and password , responds with either a token or a 403 permission error) . Use mysql as your datastore; create an appropriate database schema.\n* Containerize each of those 3 applications with Docker/containerd by writing a simple dockerfile in the code root of each, and building the images\n* Set up a mysql/mariadb server and ECS cluster or EKS cluster in the AWS console. Use the smallest instance type. You get a very limited free budget each month from AWS and costs can quickly balloon, so terminate them when you arent working on your project and re-provision when you do. Write this in terraform at some point, so that you get terraform experience. AI can be tremendously helpful and will show you how to do it. Dont just rely on the AI to do it for you, pay attention to what infra it wants to create and how the configs relate to one another\n* Write a bash script to copy the docker images you created to the ECS container repo and deploy them into the ECS or EKS cluster\n* Debug things until you are able to load your UI through your browser and the microservices work as intended. You will be able to see the data is getting stored in the database\n\nHave fun! 😅 I love this stuff and it is a great career that pays $$$$. As an SRE I am responsible for ensuring system performance and uptime, which means that being on-call is a fact of life. A software engineer can cost the company money with crappy/buggy/insecure code, but an SRE can cost a company millions of $$ and the company's reputation if they do a poor job. We get paid so much because we have a critical responsibility. Unfortunately it is a thankless job because when everything is working well, nobody cares that we exist. But when things dont work, the hammer comes down and the bosses are like \"why did you let this happen, why didnt you catch this sooner and fix it faster???\"",

The only thing you can do, is do it cheaper but that's highly variable and a lot like man vs machine.  This subreddit would disagree with me but the way tools and problems will be solved is changing drastically across the board.\n\nEssentially, you should understand MLOps, which is supporting models, config, launching, etc. however, you're going to use LLMs to troubleshoot and figure out solutions.  The only way around this is to lab, setup linux machines, have them talk to each other, host distributed systems, run kubernetes clusters, create issues, fix them, rinse repeat.\n\nI never labbed in a distributed env but I used Linux as a daily driver, which is full of enough stuff to learn.  If you want the minimal input with the highest ROI then build out an arch linux daily driver and never look back.  I use Fedora because I just want stuff to work and it's a desktop version of RHEL, so the experience is pretty nice.  Arch forces you understand things better and make tradeoffs especially when installing fresh software.\n\nAll in all, devops is for the people who are too nerdy to stay in software engineering because of the politics but still want to write a lil code, write a lil config, monitor systems, etc.\n\nEdit: if anyone bashes you (no pun intended) then ask for their github.  At the end of the day DevOps engineers write software and should have something to show for that knowledge.  Take care!",

You'll hit DNS issues, permission errors, networking quirks. That's the curriculum.\n\nThe \"breadth vs depth\" problem is real. You don't need to master Kubernetes day one. Start with a VM, a deploy script, and monitoring. Add complexity only when the current setup breaks or limits you.\n\nMost people stall because they try to learn the tooling in isolation. Terraform docs mean nothing until you've manually provisioned something and felt the pain it solves.",

I'll be honest, it's been a staggeringly steep learning curve.\n\nA few things that don't help that:\n\nHelm.  I hate helm.  Helm forces you to invent a DSL for your deployment.  If all you're doing is tying together off-the-shelf components then you can probably declare a few off-the-shelf dependencies and their values and call it job done. If you're deploying in-house software, you need to invent your own way to describe its configuration from scratch.  Hopefully you'll come up with something reasonably sane and easy to understand with as little repetition as possible, decent documentation and that is as close as possible to the underlying thing it configures.  But this interacts very badly with my next point...\n\nDevops often seems to be full of people who've failed at SWE or who are at the very beginning of their careers.  It's seen by a lot of people as somehow easier than actually writing software.  So they make all the same mistakes junior / awful SWEs make but there's no culture of \"don't do that, we know what problems it causes\" to keep them in check.  Don't be this person.  Learn your craft well.  Think about how the people who come after you will maintain what you've built.  How they will read the code you produce (even if that code is \"only\" YAML files) and discover what it means.",

Nore does DevOps require \"agile\" processes.\n\n>A lot of companies have moved away what was known as Anti-pattern Type-B with a DevOps team that sits in the middle of development and operations teams.\n\nAside from a few hottake blogs, no one knows this term much less uses it.  And if anything the industry has only *accelerated* its movement towards it rather than away from it, at least when it comes to larger enterprises.\n\n>That role is acutally going away that's been taken over by SRE/Cloud/Platform Engineering teams on the operations side. The middle man DevOps Engineer is removed because it creates a third silio thats inefficient. No need of a seperate CI/CD pipline specialist that slows things down.\n\nNo it's not.  First off if you actually read the entire blog posts you're regurgitating you'd know in the myth that \"SRE\" and \"Cloud\" Engineering roles/teams are just job responsibilities that everyone on the mythical two pizza box \"DevOps Culture Powered Super Team\" is expected to have.  Because it's easy and cheap to build teams entirely comprised of ultra-high-10x-performing super developers where everyone can do everything.\n\nAnd you'd also understand that \"Platform Engineering\" is literally the polar opposite of moving away from \"Anti-pattern Type-B\" DevOps teams.  That's because Platform Engineering is *literally* \"DevOps As A Service\" where the role/team of DevOps has been so completely siloed off that it has become a first class product in and of itself.  It's the natural end-state of DevOps is a role -> DevOps is a team -> DevOps is a service -> DevOps service is rebranded Platform Engineering so we can all get a salary bump.",

This is dumb advice for those looking to get a role or shift to DevOps.\n* Stop pretending that \"building a homelab\" is going to get you there. Most enterprises *do not run a homelab* (imagine... crazy shit right there) and have a ton of organizational policies that you need to implement and abide by that are different anywhere. Your tinkering at home with none of that context is just as useless as getting your certs in terms of being capable of actually doing the job.\n\nOverall bad advice and just silly rage bait for certifications. You don't present any sort of useful alternative nor do you add any sort of context of who it's for pretending like this is good general advice. I hope no one listens to you and I feel truly bad for any junior folks who might be relying on your poor takes to develop their careers.\n\nYour baseline premise that learning DevOps in a 6 week bootcamp is not possible is fine (and truly not unpopular as many note), but boy the content of your post is just full of being really freaking ignorant.",

I have this policy that auditors check to make sure I am adhering to which includes obtaining a director or VP of engineering approval before deploying to higher environments. Our release cycle is aggressive and I’m deploying to one of our higher envs every week on a schedule, and then there’s the need for a hotfix every once in a while. I’ve been at this job for 3.8 years, and have been working as a release engineer, Devops, SRE, or Release Manager for 26 years - so the process of obtaining approvals and adding screenshots or a copy of the approval email into the ticket is not new to me. \n\nI just don’t get it why this VP acts like it is my own personal policy every time I ask for his approval. He says the most ridiculous things at times:\n\n“Why do we even have that policy?”\n\n“Approval was granted when I asked my boss earlier in the break room - just deploy it already, why are you still waiting”\n\nthe most common response is … nothing for 12 hours til I page him in the middle of the night from the zoom call.\n\nOr today “do you want an email? I can have someone in my team send you an email and tell\n\nYou that I received the approval verbally outside of the office this morning..”\n\nI don’t get it. Every Single Time I send him the link to the internal document that clearly defines the process, and I ask him if the policy has changed. He then acts surprised.. I say it is an ‘act’ because there is no way he is forgetting that we just went over this for the 300th time a few days ago.\n\nIt makes me angrier and angrier that he is constantly trying to bypass the policies.. when I leave this job under my own accord, it will likely be because of this stupid and constant interaction with this guy.",

Get the approval workflow into your CI/CD pipeline directly. GitHub/GitLab merge approvals, or even a simple Slack bot that logs VP sign-off with a timestamp. If the approval is just clicking a button in a tool he already uses, the friction drops to near zero and you get an audit trail automatically.\n\n2. Escalate the pattern to your direct manager or the compliance team — not as a complaint about the VP, but as a process gap. Frame it as \"we have a control that's hard to enforce consistently, here's how we can automate it.\" That way you're solving a problem, not pointing fingers.\n\nAfter 26 years you already know this, but document every instance where he pushes back.

      "text": "Hey r/devops,\n\nRecently I finished a months long rewrite of the Locust K8s operator (Java → Go) and wanted to share with you since it is both relevant to the subreddit (CICD was one of the main reasons for this operator to exist in the first place) and also a huge milestone for the project. The performance gains were better than expected, but the migration path was way harder than I thought!\n\n# The Numbers\n\n**Before (Java/JVM):**\n\n* Memory: 256MB idle\n* Startup: \\~60s (JVM warmup) (optimisation could have been applied) \n* Image: 128MB (compressed)\n\n**After (Go):**\n\n* Memory: 64MB idle (4x reduction)\n* Startup: <1s (60x faster)\n* Image: 30-34MB (compressed)\n\n# Why The Rewrite\n\nHonestly, i could have kept working with Java. Nothing wrong with the language (this is not Java is trash kind of post)  and it is very stable specially for enterprise (the main environment where the operator runs). That being said, it became painful to support in terms of adding features and to keep the project up to date and patched. Migrating between framework and language versions got very demanding very quickly where i would need to spend sometimes up word of a week to get stuff to work again after a framework update.   \n  \nMoreover, adding new features became harder overtime because of some design & architectural directions I put in place early in the project. So a breaking change was needed anyway to allow the operator to keep growing and accommodate the new feature requests its users where kindly sharing with me. Thus, i decided to bite the bullet and rewrite the thing into Go. The operator was originally written in 2021 (open sourced in 2022) and my views on how to do architecture and cloud native designs have grown since then! \n\n# What Actually Mattered\n\nThe startup time was a win. In CI/CD pipelines, waiting a full minute for the operator to initialize before load tests could run was painful. Now it's instant. Of corse this assumes you want to deploy the operator with every pipeline run with a bit of \"cooldown\" in case several tests will run in a row. this enable the use of full elastic node groups in AWS EKS for example.\n\nThe memory reduction also matters in multi-tenant clusters where you're running multiple tests from multiple teams at the same time. That 4x drop adds up when you're paying for every MB.\n\n# What Was Harder Than Expected\n\n**Conversion webhooks for CRD API compatibility.** I needed to maintain v1 API support while adding v2 features. This is to help with the migration and enhance the user experience as much as possible. Bidirectional conversion (v1 ↔ v2) is brutal; you have to ensure no data loss in either direction (for the things that matter). This took longer than the actual operator rewrite.also to deal with the need cert manager was honestly a bit of a headache!\n\nIf you're planning API versioning in operators, seriously budget extra time for this.\n\n# What I Added in v2\n\nSince I was rewriting anyway, I threw in some features that were painful to add in the Java version and was in demand by the operator's users:\n\n* OpenTelemetry support (no more sidecar for metrics)\n* Proper K8s secret/env injection (stop hardcoding credentials)\n* Better resource cleanup when tests finish\n* Pod health monitoring with auto-recovery\n* Leader election for HA deployments\n* Fine-grained control over load generation pods\n\n# Quick Example\n\n    apiVersion: locust.io/v2\n    kind: LocustTest\n    metadata:\n      name: api-load-test\n    spec:\n      image: locustio/locust:2.31.8\n      testFiles:\n        configMapRef: my-test-scripts\n      master:\n        autostart: true\n      worker:\n        replicas: 10\n      env:\n        secretRefs:\n        - name: api-credentials\n      observability:\n        openTelemetry:\n          enabled: true\n          endpoint: \"http://otel-collector:4317\"\n\n# Install\n\n    helm repo add locust-k8s-operator https://abdelrhmanhamouda.github.io/locust-k8s-operator\n    helm install locust-operator locust-k8s-operator/locust-k8s-operator --version 2.1.1\n\n**Links:** [GitHub](https://github.com/AbdelrhmanHamouda/locust-k8s-operator) | [Docs](https://abdelrhmanhamouda.github.io/locust-k8s-operator/)\n\nAnyone else doing Java→Go operator rewrites?

K6 is awesome for many reasons but when it comes to the ability to do distributed performance testing locust is way ahead even today. Another point is that for an enterprise with Java as main language that has to introduce a new language, with locust, devs can use python for both the scripting language AND extending the engine when needed (happened a lot). With k6 you can’t do that, you must use Go to extend the engine and js for scripting. This as one can imagine makes things more complex. In my case those 2 were the deciding factors to go with locust. \n\nHonestly after a lot of serious research that I put in this, k6 is awesome if you are doing a single node test but locust is 1000 the way to go for any sort of serious distributed testing.",

Artifact tooling gets expensive fast once you need SSO + replication + scanning.\n\nWhat’s driven me crazy in Artifactory/Nexus isn’t just pricing — it’s operational weight. JVM tuning, slow UI under load, painful upgrades, and storage bloat from poor retention defaults. Harbor is lighter, but once you go multi-region with replication and RBAC complexity, it gets messy.\n\nBig gap I still see: clean multi-cloud replication with conflict handling and observability built in. Most tools say “replication,” but debugging drift or partial failures is painful. Also, first-class SBOM management and policy enforcement tied to CI would be huge.\n\nIf you’re building this, I’d focus hard on: HA story, backup/restore simplicity, and how it behaves at scale (1000s of repos, heavy CI churn). That’s where most open-source projects fall apart.\n\nHow are you handling metadata storage and horizontal scaling under high push/pull concurrency?",

Postgres never touches the actual artifacts so it doesn't choke at scale. Large downloads redirect to presigned S3 URLs so the backend stays out of the data path entirely. Stateless + Tokio means you can just run more replicas behind a load balancer when concurrency spikes.\n\nReplication is peer mesh rather than hub-and-spoke, with per-repo sync schedules, task-level error tracking, and health-scored routing. Drift observability is honestly still rough, that's the part I'm least happy with and it's high on the roadmap.\n\nSBOM (CycloneDX + SPDX) and CVE tracking are built in. Policy enforcement tied to CI is partially there. Backup is a single tar.gz to S3 or filesystem, nothing fancy.\n\nHA is my honest weak spot right now. The stateless backend + Postgres HA gets you pretty far, and peers give geographic redundancy, but true active-active failover isn't there yet. I'd rather say that than pretend it's solved.\n\nIf you want to poke at it, Docker Compose gets you running in about 2 minutes.",

Private repos require authentication, public ones are open to anyone. Permissions are per-repo with user and group assignments covering read, write, delete, and admin actions. API tokens can be scoped to specific repos. So you could keep internal packages in private repos with team-level group permissions and publish your open source output to public repos all from the same instance.

AI tools are shipping weekly.

If CPU > 90% for 15 minutes, that's different from a 30-second spike\n- Correlate alerts. If 6 alerts fire within 2 minutes, that's probably one incident, not six. Most monitoring tools can group these but nobody sets it up\n\nThe other pattern that kills teams: alerting on the same thing at multiple layers. Your app alerts on slow DB queries, your infra alerts on high DB connections, your DB alerts on lock contention — it's all the same incident generating 3 separate pages.\n\nWe went from ~40 alerts/day to about 5 by ruthlessly deleting anything that wasn't directly tied to user impact or data loss risk.

High CPU? You'll be fine for a while. DB is inaccessible? Alert right away. Low disk space? Boring, let me know if it doesn't clear up in a few hours (and if it does, this is a problem that then needs to go to the devs)\n\nAlso, differentiate the alerts that are \"this is fine to live on a dashboard\" versus \"a meatsack must be actively told!\". Put the dashboard on a screen in view of the team somewhere, that sort of thing. \n\nTL;DR: invest in managing your alerts pipeline",

We did an audit and found like 70% of our alerts had never led to a real action being taken, they were just noise that people acknowledged and moved on from. Killed all of those immediately.\n\nThe other thing that made a huge difference was correlating alerts instead of treating them individually. A disk filling up + high latency + increased error rate on the same service within a 5 min window is one incident, not three separate pages. Most monitoring tools are terrible at this out of the box tho, we ended up building some basic correlation logic ourselves. Theres some newer AI-powered observability tools that claim to do this automatically but honestly the ones ive tried are still pretty hit or miss.\n\nThe hard truth is alert fatigue is usually a symptom of not having clear SLOs defined. Once you know exactly what \"healthy\" looks like for each service, you only alert on deviations from that. Everything else becomes a dashboard metric you check during business hours",

This helps reducing the noise.

Your server issue started as minor performance degradation and escalated, which means the early signals were there but spread across different monitors.

Doesn't replace your alerting, just helps when something does fire and you need to figure out what's actually going on: https://github.com/incidentfox/incidentfox",

          "text": "Apple's DevOps interviews typically run 4-6 rounds and they're going to hit you hard on fundamentals - expect deep dives into infrastructure as code, CI/CD pipelines, containerization, monitoring, and incident response. They care a lot about how you think through problems and your ability to explain complex technical decisions in simple terms. The compensation is competitive with other FAANG companies, so for mid-level you're looking at 180-250K total comp, senior can push 300K+, and staff+ goes well beyond that. Don't overthink the \"Apple culture\" thing - just be genuine, show you can collaborate, and demonstrate that you understand production systems at scale. As for what not to say, avoid badmouthing previous employers and don't pretend to know something you don't - they'll catch you immediately.\n\nYou're going to make it further than you think if you focus on articulating your actual experience clearly rather than memorizing textbook answers. They want to see how you've solved real problems, not how well you can recite best practices. Talk about your failures and what you learned from them - that's actually valuable to interviewers. The technical bar is high but it's not impossible, and the fact that you got the interview means someone already thinks you have what it takes. If you want some help articulating your experience better during the actual interview, I built [AI Assistant](http://interviews.chat) to sell yourself more effectively when you're in the hot seat.",

You know how it goes :0\n\nEnded up cutting like 30% just from the obvious stuff but it was all manual. Just me going through dashboards and monitors trying to figure out what's actually being used vs what's just sitting there costing money\n\nHow do you guys handle this? Does anyone actually do regular cleanups or does the bill just grow until finance starts asking questions? And how do you even figure out what's safe to remove without breaking someone's alert? \n\nCurious to hear anyone's \"why the hell are we paying for this\" moments, especially from bigger teams since I'm at a smaller company and still figuring out what normal looks like\n\nThanks in advance! :)",

Nobody would deploy a service and never review whether it's still needed, but somehow we all just let metrics and log pipelines accumulate forever.\n\nWhat actually worked for us was writing a simple script that queries the DD API for all custom metrics, then cross-references which ones appear in any dashboard or monitor. Anything orphaned goes on a list. We review it monthly and it takes maybe 20 minutes now. The first time we ran it we found over 40% of our custom metrics weren't referenced anywhere.\n\nThe other thing that saved us real money was being aggressive about log exclusion filters at the agent level. Health checks, readiness probes, noisy debug logs from third-party libraries — all of that was being indexed by default. Pushing those filters as close to the source as possible cut our log ingest bill in half without losing anything useful.",

If nobody complains, it's safe to remove.\n\nOne thing that helped us beyond the Datadog-specific cleanup: we started tracking observability cost as a percentage of infrastructure cost. If your monitoring bill is more than \\~5-8% of what you're monitoring, something is off. It's a simple ratio but it gives you a sanity check and a number to track over time.\n\nFor the \"how do you know what's safe to remove\" question — we wrote a simple script that hits the DD API to find metrics not referenced in any dashboard or monitor, and also checks the metrics/search endpoint to see last query time. The combination of \"not in any dashboard AND not queried in 60 days\" is a pretty safe removal candidate.\n\nThe root cause though is what another commenter said — treat your observability pipeline like application code. New metrics should go through a review process just like new infrastructure. If you don't gate it, it'll grow unchecked.",

However, most DevOps jobs ive seen require k8s at scale- focusing on reliability/observability. I have worked with Kubernetes lightly, inspecting pod failures etc, but nothing that would allow me to deploy and maintain a kubernetes cluster.

I’m not some super strong 10x engineer or anything, but I get stuff done. I’ve worked with Python before, built features, written scripts, worked with Azure DevOps (not super in-depth, but enough to be functional).\n\nRecently though, I’ve been asked to work on Jenkins pipelines at my firm. This is my first time properly working on CI/CD at an enterprise level.\n\nThey’ve asked me to create a baked-in container and write a Jenkinsfile. I can read the existing code and mostly understand what’s happening, but when it comes to building something similar myself, I just get confused.\n\nIt’s enterprise-level infra, so there are tons of permission issues, access restrictions, random failures, etc. The original setup was done by someone who has left the company, and honestly no one in my team fully understands how everything is wired together. So I’m basically trying to reverse-engineer the whole thing.\n\nOn top of that, I’m also expected to work on Airflow DAGs to automate certain Python scripts. I’ve worked on Airflow before, but that setup was completely different — the DAG configs were already structured. Here, I have to build DAGs from scratch and everything feels scattered. I’m confused about database access, where connections are defined, how everything is deployed, etc.\n\nSo it’s Jenkins + baked containers + Airflow DAGs + infra + permissions… all at once.\n\nI’m constantly scared of breaking something or messing up pipelines that other teams rely on. I’m not that strong with Linux either, so that adds another layer of stress. I spend a lot of time staring at configs, feeling overwhelmed, and then I get so mentally drained that I don’t make much progress.\n\nThe environment itself isn’t toxic. No one is yelling at me. But internally I feel like I’m underperforming. I keep worrying that I’ll disappoint the people who trusted me when they hired me, and that they’ll think I was the wrong hire.\n\nHas anyone else been thrown into heavy CI/CD + infra work early in their career without proper documentation or mentorship?\n\nHow do you deal with the overwhelm and the fear of breaking things? And how do you stop feeling like you don’t belong?\n\nWould really appreciate any advice. 🙏",

Too many juniors/mids go straight to AI these days and don’t put in the hard miles, but it sounds like you have the right mindset. \n\nThe only thing I would say is be honest and tell your manager that you can’t juggle both things, the DAGs in Airflow AND working out the Jenkins setup is not achievable, unless given time. Even for a senior that would asking a lot. Just be honest, something I learnt through my career is it’s not a sign of weakness to admit you don’t know something. I find juniors and even mid level guys are terrified of this but I promise, no one is going to look down on you for not knowing. That’s our job to work things out, you just get a bit quicker at it once you’ve been in the game a while. Anyway, good luck, like I say, it sounds like you have the right mindset to learn and progress so stick at it.",

I have started pushing back on these “cross team collaborations” saying not my circus, get a PM. You will learn at the senior level that you cannot have responsibility without authority. And when it comes time to deliver and other teams haven’t done their work because you can’t tell them to change their sprint, it looks bad on you. Especially once you get more senior and have been around these other leads for a while, you get to know that some of them have entire departments riding on their shoulders and they can barely get done what’s on their plate already without you coming in to add to it. Be careful with how much you take on. You can be the point technical person without being the project driver. That’s the sweet spot. Influence without title is a dopamine high until you get more projects without more resources. Then it’s all downhill. Also regarding imposter syndrome it never goes anyway. The more I learn the more I question if what im doing is right. I run 24/7 global financial infrastructure by myself with no team, and I still question if I am doing basic things correctly.",

They should generally be better for Terraform/AWS stuff given the longer history. My comment was more with my experience being on the receiving end of folks (mis)using AI to review logs for anomalies but lacking important context. So I spend hours chasing down red herrings because the AI invented issues that didn't exist. To your use-case - absolutely, AI is awesome at producing quick one-liners or scripts to complete common tasks; definitely use it for that type of thing. But also have enough knowledge of what it's providing that you don't capy-pasta \"sudo rm -rf /\\*\" or similar.  \n\\- Imposter syndrome is real.
