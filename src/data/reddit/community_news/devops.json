      "text": "I’ve been lurking here for years, and after reading some recent posts, I need to say something that might make me unpopular with the \"CV-Driven Development\" crowd.\n\n**We are engineering our own burnout.**\n\nI've sat on hiring panels for the last 6 months, and the state of \"Senior\" DevOps is terrifying. I’m seeing a generation of engineers who can write complex Helm charts but can’t explain how DNS propagation works or debugging a TCP handshake.\n\nHere is my analysis of why our industry is currently broken:\n\n**1. The Abstraction Addiction** We are solving problems we don't have. I saw a candidate last week propose a multi-cluster Kubernetes setup with Istio for a simple internal CRUD app. When I asked *why* not just use a boring EC2 instance or ECS task, they looked at me like I suggested using FTP. We are choosing tools not because they solve a business problem, but because we want to put them on our LinkedIn. We are voluntarily taking on the operational overhead of Netflix without having their scale or their headcount.\n\n**2. The Death of Debugging** To the user who posted \"New DevOps please learn networking\": **Thank you.** We are abstracting away the underlying systems so heavily that we are creating engineers who can \"configure\" but cannot \"fix.\" When the abstraction leaks (and it always does, usually at 3 AM), these \"YAML Engineers\" are helpless because they don't understand the Linux primitives underneath.\n\n**3. Hiring is a Carnival Game** We ask for 8 rounds of interviews to test for trivia on 15 different tools, but we don't test for **systems thinking**. Real seniority isn't knowing the flags for every CLI tool; it's knowing when *not* to use a tool. It's about telling management, \"No, we don't need to migrate to that shiny new thing.\"\n\n**4. Complexity = Job Security (False)** We tell ourselves that building complex systems makes us valuable. It doesn't. It makes us pagers. The best infrared engineers I know build systems so boring that they sleep through the night. If you are currently building a resume-padder architecture: **Stop.**  \n\n\n  \nIf you are a Junior: Stop trying to learn the entire CNCF landscape. Learn Linux. Learn Networking. Learn a scripting language deeply. If you are a Senior: Stop checking boxes. Start deleting code.  \n\n\nThe most senior thing you can do is build something so simple it looks like a junior did it, but it never goes down.\n\n/endrant",

The site was dreadfully slow, it went down all the time, was very complex (for example, staff had to manually set cookies in their browsers to get routed to the proper back-end via HAProxy or risk breaking things), and cost around $2,000/month in AWS. The site was actually quite basic with some modest traffic.\n\nI spun up a VPS from a provider that they already had an account for, set up a basic LAMP stack, did some rudimentary hardening, migrated the site to it, set up monitoring, and set up backups. All told, it took less than a day to do this. The site was way faster, was very stable, and was extremely simple for staff to use.\n\nThe owner asked me what I did. I explained that I just moved the site to a VPS and got rid of the complexity.\n\nOwner: \"How much will that cost us?\"\n\nMe: \"I dropped the monthly expenses from $2,000 to $20.\"\n\nOwner: \"Oh. You did some kind of optimization magic? Something special?\"\n\nMe: \"Nope. It's just a basic VPS with a LAMP stack on it.\"\n\nI don't think he ever believed me.",

And I'm like \"ok what if we just put it in the DB directly at the start?\" \"no that's not gonna be scalable\"... Meanwhile our DB is on a 16 CPU server running at 2% usage for 99% of the day because we need it all everynight when an indexing worker runs and pulls the whole DB 16 times because no one wants to take a look at what queries their MVC framework will run.\n\nYea things are crazy out there.",

Because those layers were abstracted in your time, just like networking is now abstracted by cloud providers and Kubernetes. Abstraction did not start yesterday.\n\nI agree that a good engineer needs a solid understanding of their environment. What I disagree with is throwing around random low-level facts like DNS propagation or TCP handshakes as a badge of honor. That is just blowing one’s own trumpet. By that logic, I could argue that everyone should deeply understand NFS small-packet overhead. I dealt with it in the past. Most people did not, and that is fine.\n\nNo single engineer can know everything. Teams work because knowledge is distributed. It is good to have someone strong in networking, someone else focused on Kubernetes and Prometheus, and others closer to application or business logic. Some engineers simply want to do their job well, get paid, and go home. That does not make them bad engineers.\n\nRegarding the constant rants about cloud, Kubernetes, and microservices (“I mOvEd A SErVicE To a TeApOt AnD mAkE iT 9TiMeS FaStEr”) those anecdotes say nothing about the technology itself. They only show that the previous system was poorly analyzed or badly designed for its actual requirements.\n\nThis growing neoluddism in our field is exhausting. The anti-cloud, anti-Kubernetes, anti-CNCF posture, where every modern tool is treated as stupid or pedantic, is itself shallow. Rejecting tools by default is no more mature than adopting them blindly.\n\nThat does not mean everything should run on Kubernetes, or that every system needs a service mesh. It means these tools and architectures exist for specific reasons and solve specific problems. As engineers, our responsibility is to understand what those problems are and when a tool fits — and when it clearly does not.",

They are so accustomed to using one thing or the other and paying out the nose that they forgot you can just do it in a simple manner and get better performance and -\\*gasp\\*- do brick layer backup. No need to redeploy for anything, we can wrench on it while it is running, no problem.\n\nOne day I will amaze them by showing them an entire cloud in one rack, what we used to call a 'mainframe'. One of my go-tos is to ask why their proposed architecture is any better than buying a mainframe. It isn't that I am actually going to ever buy a mainframe, unless I need the fastest processor to disk wiring available on the planet, I am probing whether they understand why they are doing what they are doing. \n\nFor the record, we are refactoring our main application to use things like kafka and even driven architecture, away from database SPROCs and EXE jobs. We have obvious and sound engineering reasons to do this. The physicals of our app (we use actual physical sensors and what not) are appropriate for an event driven architecture, something harder to do when we initially deployed the paradigm we are on in 2003. Hell, this paradigm will last another 22 years if we really want it too, but it is inflexible and lacks a durable control and monitoring layer. So it isn't like I am anti new technology, I am anti new technology from people who need resume fillers who don't know about anything else and assume us old heads are just stodgy old bastards who don't want to learn anything new.

          "text": "Totally agree with you here (and that’s rare for this sub). I interviewed with a company recently and I was pleasantly surprised that a lot of what you described as missing from senior engineering (this was staff level) was asked of me. I was not asked a single technical question about any specific AWS resource; instead, they focused on my problem solving, my ability to architect a solution for a problem, and importantly to your point, asking when I would want to use something more complicated vs less complicated and why. \n\nI didn’t prepare myself well for that since I was so used to people trying to trip me up on pedantic things they knew and memorized vs what I knew and memorized. \n\nOne of the first things I did at my current job (as lead) was to have a scenario-based learning session about DNS and how to troubleshoot. I agree that having people immediately starting in a cloud environment and sometimes their first job being in DevOps (how??) means they missed that physical resource experience many of us got in data centers or on-prem racks. They’re also starting off automating things sometimes believing it’s “magic” how some of us know things. As much as we try to teach that everything we all do started off with some manual deployment into a test environment, testing, and then automating once it’s understood, I think the pressure and expectations some junior engineers feel to be delivering at the same pace as senior engineers means they’re skipping these steps. They then depend on more senior engineers to do the debugging/learning for them via PRs, Slack, etc, much further along in the process. \n\nAnd the proliferation of AI (LLM), along with the lie many believe that this will be a near-future replacement for engineers, is a detriment to this. So many times I’ve seen hand-wavy changes that LLM did it and it worked so it’s the solution, when many times the requirements were not understood or the solution LLM came up with was not similar to what all the other engineers were used to or the patterns used across the team. \n\nMany challenges to overcome. But admitting we have problems and being critical of the current workflows is a great place to start",

We literally built the modern infrastructure incrementally out of necessity. We took the long way, we experimented, we made mistakes, we tried all the options, we have a wealth of knowledge about what works and what doesn't and what is efficient and what is not.\n\nReminds me of developers advocating for converting bash scripts to java a few decades ago - they took functionality that ran on 20mhz cpus with a few dozen lines of code and took almost no RAM and turned it into software that needed a Java VM that needed constant patching, upgrading, ... licensing..., and required 10x the CPU and ram resources (or more) and was a bloody mess to maintain compared to the original bash scripts.  ... and then some team declared victory once all the nasty bash scripts were replaced.\n\nYounger employees grew up in the era of \"just use Visual Studio code with autocomplete (and now AI) - no need to go deeper than you need\", \"just learn cloud provisioning APIs - no need to go deeper than you need\", \"just use terraform for everything - no need to get too deep into any cloud service\", \"just use docker containers - no need to understand what's in them\", \"just use kubernetes - no need to understand hardware\"\n\nThat is what they know.\n\nWhen all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\n\nWhen all you have is kubernetes, everything looks like a problem that kubernetes can solve.\n\nHaving said all of that, there's important context -- when all you have are people who use vs code, only code in typescript, and struggle to keep production services updated and secure -- there's a strategic advantage to building things using high level, simple, scriptable, repeatable, externally maintained pieces.  \n  \nand... it's progress, inevitable, and unavoidable - gone are the days when software is written in assembly for performance and speed because the humans involved in the software equation are the most expensive part - if it's 100x slower and takes 100x more hardware, that's still cheaper than requiring more human work. If it's 10x slower and CPU is cheap, it may not be worth the optimization.\n\nalso, one reaches a point where it's IMPOSSIBLE for any one human to understand modern tech - look at large, mature software products and see if you can count how many active developers actually KNOW the entire codebase - chances are it's few to none. Look at modern hardware design - nobody can simply 'design' a ciruit board and use off the shelf logic chips anymore - they're all multilayer boards with custom chips and everything is miniaturized. Hardware and circuit boards we used to be able to debug and repair are pretty much field replacable units that get junked when something goes wrong now.",

I am about 1 month way from 90 % backend testing , the likes. Similar in the frontend, we are ripping up many things and keep simplifying. Same with our architecture. Kubernetes survived, but the whole cluster thing got simplified to death also. I dont want to see anything near distributed transactions , cap theorem and saga patterns for the whole year. I even got myself out of interviews in my day job. Last one i did, I almost started yelling to my colleague when he started roasting the candidate about hexagonal architecture and choreography saga. FUCK THEM ALL. Business value, simplicity, and sleep at nights. I brought down my delivery cycle for new features to extreme times. Thats my innovation. You can keep your redis and kafka and all this. I will go with postgres and simplicity and the rest only for the day job in large corporations . No more CV padding. No more flexing.

      "text": "    Hey ,\n    \n    \n    I built this thing called K8sQuest because I was tired of paying for cloud sandboxes and wanted to practice debugging broken clusters.\n    \n    \n    ## What it is\n    \n    \n    It's basically a game that intentionally breaks things in your local kind cluster and makes you fix them. 50 levels total, going from \"why is this pod crashing\" to \"here's 9 broken things in a production scenario, good luck.\"\n    \n    \n    Runs entirely on Docker Desktop with kind. No cloud costs.\n    \n    \n    ## How it works\n    \n    \n    1. Run `./play.sh` - game starts, breaks something in k8s\n    2. Open another terminal and debug with kubectl\n    3. Fix it however you want\n    4. Run `validate` in the game to check\n    5. Get a debrief explaining what was wrong and why\n    \n    \n    The game Has hints, progress tracking, and step-by-step guides if you get stuck.\n    \n    \n    ## What you'll debug\n    \n    \n    - World 1: CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff, pending pods, labels, ports\n    - World 2: Deployments, HPA, liveness/readiness probes, rollbacks\n    - World 3: Services, DNS, Ingress, NetworkPolicies\n    - World 4: PVs, PVCs, StatefulSets, ConfigMaps, Secrets  \n    - World 5: RBAC, SecurityContext, node scheduling, resource quotas\n    \n    \n    Level 50 is intentionally chaotic - multiple failures at once.\n    \n    \n    ## Install\n    \n    \n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/Manoj-engineer/k8squest.git\n    cd k8squest\n    ./install.sh\n    ./play.sh\n    ```\n    \n    \n    Needs: Docker Desktop, kubectl, kind, python3\n    \n    \n    ## Why I made this\n    \n    \n    Reading docs didn't really stick for me. I learn better when things are broken and I have to figure out why. This simulates the actual debugging you do in prod, but locally and with hints.\n    \n    \n    Also has safety guards so you can't accidentally nuke your whole cluster (learned that the hard way).\n    \n    \n    Feedback welcome. If it helps you learn, cool. If you find bugs or have ideas for more levels, let me know.\n    \n    \n    GitHub: https://github.com/Manoj-engineer/k8squest.git",

If you don't want to do them, I'd try to concentrate on jobs that are all (or mostly) on-prem or specify system administrator over more deveops-y titles like cloud engineer or platform engineer.\n\nIf that doesn't work, the upside is that doing Leetcode does eventually get easier.  The downside is that it can take awhile -- just keep at it.  It's also not necessary to know every single concept.  I would start by focusing on the easy/medium string/array type problems.  I would think the odds of getting problems using graphs and dynamic programming would be pretty small.\n\nI'd also recommend memorizing traversal patterns like looping backwards from the end, adding/removing letters/elements, and backtracking with recursion.  You can waste a lot of time debugging out of bounds errors, fighting the subtle differences between a string and an array, and having recursive calls crash because you sliced() the string/array incorrectly at one end.

          "text": "You’re not broken, and you’re definitely not alone. What you’re running into is a structural problem with how the industry hires, not a reflection of your ability or relevance. Leetcode is not a proxy for “can you do the job.” It’s a proxy for “can you recognize algorithm patterns under artificial constraints with no real-world context.” Sysadmin work is almost the opposite. It’s about reasoning under uncertainty, understanding long-lived systems, debugging stateful failures, and making tradeoffs when there’s no clean answer. None of that maps cleanly to sliding window tricks or binary search variations. The fact that the problems don’t resemble your day-to-day Python work is actually expected. In real systems, you’re reading existing code, modifying behavior safely, dealing with side effects, handling bad inputs, and thinking about blast radius. In interviews, you’re often asked to invent a solution from scratch in a vacuum. That’s not how production work happens.\n\nGrinding more Leetcode might improve your Leetcode score, but it won’t suddenly make the patterns feel intuitive unless you enjoy that kind of abstraction. And at 40, you shouldn’t feel obligated to reshape your entire career around a hiring filter that wasn’t designed with your experience in mind. A more pragmatic approach is to target roles and companies that value operational depth. Platform, SRE, infra-heavy teams, and smaller companies tend to care far more about system design, debugging stories, and real incident experience. If you do prep coding, focus on reading and modifying existing codebases, not puzzle-solving. Practice explaining how you’d debug a production issue or safely refactor a brittle script.\n\nYou don’t need to become a “toilet farmer.” You need interviews that actually test the skills you’ve spent 15 years building.",

      "text": "Hi folks, I work as a freelance DevOps engineer, and in 2020–2022 I used to get 2-3 recruiter calls a day.. those were crazy times. It started to slowly fade off, and by mid-2023, although I still managed to get offers, it was noticeably harder.\n\nCurrently, the company I’m working at has a large proportion of developers compared to the DevOps team (I’d say \\~15% DevOps, 85% devs). Our management tried multiple shiny tools to improve our processes, but we ended up using AI only for PR reviews and even that is mostly for pre-screening. We still have to manually review things since AI makes mistakes and hallucinates.\n\nFor past few years usual response around here was \"Hey, these guys don’t know how to use AI and .. it’s a skill issue.\" but imo These folks haven’t dealt with complex infrastructure beyond boilerplate to think AI can automate DevOps.\n\nDuring the past three years, I've heard all sorts of things: \"Everything will be automated,\" \"It’s just the first year of AI wait and see in a couple of years there won’t be dev jobs,\" \"Devin will eliminate engineers.. (LOL to this one)\", and so on. All this hype and bubble kept growing, yet where I worked there were no meaningful headcount reductions beyond cutting back on intern and junior roles doing mostly grunt work and boilerplate and even that ended up hurting us.\n\nAnyway, all of this could have remained speculation, if not for the fact that DevOps positions previously considered redundant due to \"more efficient processes\" are now being filled again, and the 5-6 DevOps engineers on our team are so overworked that we urgently need to hire more people.\n\nIn short (TL;DR), I haven’t seen any meaningful AI automation beyond what we already had, nor did it add much real value to our team. At best, it made us slightly more efficient, but at the cost of reduced maintainability and more complexity in the codebase. If you enjoy working in DevOps, there are still plenty of opportunities out there and likely more going forward.",

It would be unrealistic to assume that AI can automate every form of knowledge work except for one specific role.\n\nWe have already seen meaningful success using AI in DevOps-related tasks. At the moment, AI is even more effective in areas like software engineering and application development, but DevOps capabilities are also improving steadily, almost week by week.\n\nWill companies eventually replace all DevOps engineers? Probably not. But is it plausible that 80 to 90 percent of current DevOps work could be automated over time? I think so.\n\nGiven that possibility, the point is not to predict an exact timeline, but to be prepared. \n\nPreparing for a potential breakthrough where AI takes over a large share of DevOps responsibilities is simply a prudent approach, even if that moment arrives later than expected or not at all.",

Originally, it was supposed to be about breaking down silos and shared responsibility, but in many places, it has just turned into a dumping ground for everything the dev team doesn't want to deal with.\n\nIf a deployment fails, it’s a DevOps problem. If the cloud bill is too high, it’s a DevOps problem. If a database is slow, call DevOps. We’ve gone from \"building platforms\" to just being the people who get paged at 3 AM because a script we didn't write failed in a way we couldn't predict. We are spending so much time putting out fires that we don't have the bandwidth to actually automate the systems that prevent them.\n\nI’ve been trying to document some better boundaries and automation patterns on OrbonCloud lately.\nAre we just stuck as the \"everything\" engineers now?",

The focus on experimentation is shifting away from pipeline design to AI tooling efficiency and how to make use of it in testing, security, and observability.\n\nHence, if you were hired as a DevOps engineer, you'll now be saddled with not only making sure the development pipelines are working, but that the production systems they feed are operating and that the feedback loop (which we used to try to send to developers) is plugged into some AI-driven analysis toolset and delivering useful feedback.\n\n**tl;dr**: this was always what the job was, people just give it different names based on the technological zeitgeist",

When Kim and Humble packaged the DevOps role, they did a lot of work to carve out a lot of what amounted to generalists' responsibilities and line them up as specialties that could be fit together and served more efficiently overall by arranging them as a series of tightly integrated roles.\n\nNow that those arrangements are well-understood, it's become more useful (or rather, businesses are motivated to narrow their personnel) to have a \"specialist\" who can understand the whole system— and once again, generalize over it.\n\nTBF, I'm just restating myself all over again.

Back in the day we had some largely useless ops teams filled with it guys of whom many could hardly even script.  They were busy maintaining onprem when cloud took off.  So Devops romped in with the brandwagon bs,  and many of the primitive scm teams who were all just about build and deploy just took on the devops title.  They even kept blabbing on about CI as if it was some new revelation ( it wasn't.  I was doing ci and cd back in the 90s and it was called ci even back then).\n\nHell, even the agile brandwagon was just a collection of 20-30 year old methods which were rebranded.  Only difference was how badly and innappropriately misapplied they were to become.\n\nWhen onprem shutdown,  devops was left.  So some has to do ops,  and devops is the only group there to do it.\n\nBut don't qorry,  the software sales guys got their investment peoperties,  boats and mistresses.",

Took me a while to wrap my head around it.\n\nThe name basically originates from kubelet (a quadlet is a flattened kubelet) or if you squash a kube you get a quad. Thinking about it from the kubelet direction helped me grasping what red hat is trying to do.",

I would love that world.\n\nI became a master of many skills but in a slightly different way...\n\nI've been developing code for 20+ years, including before DevOps really existed. I had to know Linux and how to run my software on servers. It wasn't too difficult for me to pick up Terraform, Kubernetes, etc because I was able to understand why they exist and what problems they solved. So now I'm the guy that does everything. With my current job, which was a new project, I set up the backend architecture, including inter service communication and db migration processes. I work for a financial firm so they have a DevOps team that provides really basic Kubernetes templates that have some standard configs they need present for auditing, control, etc, but I did all the other Kubernetes configuration for my project for each service and job needed. I also set up the frontend, including the vite build process, as well as the client side routing, base level components, and a universal ajax wrapper for auth, request ids, etc.\n\nI learned all of this because I have control issues, so I don't like when someone outside of my direct team has control over a piece of our project. I would rather learn how to do something so I don't have to rely on someone else when the project has issues. I also get fewer questions and frustrations from Traders and MDs if I can tell them the issue and that I'm working on it, vs saying it's an issue with XYZ and I'm waiting on another team.",

Today, you're not doing things properly if you don't practice DevOps anyway, so it makes sense once it's easy enough for everyone.",

Platform-Eng is still there for expert consulting and helping provision less conventional requirements.\n\nI don't know if that's what you mean by devs doing devops.",

But if you can do dev coding and devops you are a perfect software engineer and it took me 2 years to realise this. But it is what it is. So I have started doing coding and Backend.

      "text": "I am strongly considering becoming a nurse (then eventually taking an APRN path) or AA. Half of my family are healthcare providers and they literally never worry about jobs. My brother is 26 and made $175k as a travel nurse this year. He bought a house as well. He works 3 days a week on night shift and games when he gets home. My mother makes $250k+ as a 20-year nurse (traveling) and she is about to become an NP. I currently make six figures working remotely as a Platform Engineer, but I have mentally checked out at this point. Although I do well for myself, I don’t even feel stable enough to participate in the economy (have kids, buy a home, etc). This goes beyond just financial comparison. I am thinking about the scalability of my future (more-so my stability).\n\nI think the stress of constantly needing to learn 7 different tools that seem to do the same thing is draining. I’m tired of being a glorified YAML janitor for efforts that are only efforts because stakeholders feel like they need complex distributed system (which ends up involving using k8s with engineers who barely know how it works) architectures for shitty Drupal sites. For legacy systems, I setup abstract Ansible or Terraform workflows (because most people on my team are allergic to LLMs that can help them write IaC themselves) for people just to use once or twice a month then discard. I can’t tell if I am a data engineer or “infrastructure” dude because the lines are blurred and the people who traditionally share those roles are checked out as well. I have a security clearance, so I can’t even OE. That’s considered timesheet fraud. I want to work in the private sector, but you guys are getting cooked like fries in grease.\n\nThis may sound insane, but I would rather deal with the stress of my actual job than deal with the stress of wondering if I will have one every year. If my stability was more predictable, I would be more motivated to level up my skills consistently. Since there is actually no sense of time or grounding in this industry, I literally do the bare minimum a project requires because I know some idealistic lead or manager is going to go to a seminar and come back claiming that we need to use OpenShift for an application with 500 users. I used to actually lab, study for certs and post on LinkedIn. I stopped because it felt performative. There is now a pattern of technical theatrics I am starting to notice that is slightly disappointing. After you reach a point of no return in this field, you start to realize that the true learning is in real-work experience which is the only thing I have going for me, but the experience is not sensible. They are resume-driven vanity projects disguised as progress.\n\nI am not going to just quit since I know I am in a good spot for my age and we are in a bad economy, but sometimes the nature of our work drives me nuts. I’m sure healthcare would be hell but at least it’s a predictable hell. Imagine not knowing whether or not you’re going to be chilling in the 3rd circle, 7th circle or 9th circle on any given day. ",

The smell was awful and I was forcing myself every step of the way to be there. I constrasted that with the students who loved it and just ate it up (the subject, not the bodies :P ).

When I was in school for my engineering degree (electrical/mechanical, but toward CS which wasn't quite an established thing), it was already extremely clear that stuff that was made in the past would always need people to maintain them in the future. In the two and a half decades past that: this is still true today and in fact there's an even bigger pile of software shit that we've all created.\n\nI don't even think it's that far off from people and sickness, people pop up all the time and they get sick and hurt throughout so there's an infinite pile of human bodies to take care of: same as software/services.\n\nOf course if your job is causing you anxiety then staying in that is not great and a switch may well be the right thing for you. I've worked with quite a few RNs and I have a few friends who are internists: I don't know if I could do that type of work. It'd be way too stressful to have actual lives and people's quality of life depend on my actions. And I would worry that if my only reasoning is: I can make 6 figures as a nurse thus I will become one... seems like a great way to come in to yet another job you'll stress out about. Maybe you are passionate about helping people, coming from a family who is like that: it's not unlikely that you are... but you should consider: what is the motivation of my family members to do this work. I'd bet that it's not \"well it makes me earn 6 figures\" certainly not for nurses.",

Shift work is a reality and consistency in schedules are not common. \n\nIt can be rewarding at times, but it is often mundane and sometimes can be soul wrenching. You need to love the patient care aspect of the job as much as the application of medical science if working in a clinical setting.

The consistency and predictability are definitely higher.\n\nAs others have stated the travelling rates you are citing seem to be in HCOL areas as well. And you can't guarantee they will always have openings for a chosen nursing specialty. In other areas you might see less earnings than you will in your current role.

      "text": "tbh I’m not even sure how to phrase this without sounding paranoid, but here goes.\n\nMy boss recently asked me to help “optimize internal workflows” using AI agents. You know the pitch, less manual ops, fewer handoffs, hug AI, yadda yadda. On paper it all makes sense.\n\nSo now we’ve got agents doing real stuff. Updating records. Triggering actions in SaaS tools. Touching systems that actually matter, not just generating suggestions.\n\nAnd like… technically it’s fine.  \nThe APIs work.  \nAuth is valid.  \nLogs exist somewhere.\n\nBut I keep having this low-level discomfort I can’t explain away.\n\nIf something goes wrong, I can already imagine the conversation:\n\n“Why was the agent able to do that?”  \n“Who approved this?”  \n“Was this intended behavior?”\n\nAnd the honest answer would probably be:  \n“Well… the code allowed it.”\n\nWhich feels like a terrible answer to give, esp. if you’re the one who wired it together.\n\nRight now everyone’s chill because volume is low and you can still grep logs or ask the person who built it (me 🙃). But I can’t shake the feeling that once this scales, we’re gonna be in a spot where something happens and suddenly I’m expected to explain not just what happened, but why it was okay that it happened.\n\nAnd idk, pointing at code or configs feels weak in that situation. Code explains how, not who decided this was acceptable. Those feel like different things, but we keep treating them as the same.\n\nMaybe I’m overthinking it. Maybe this is just how automation always feels at first. But it reminds me of other “works fine until it really doesn’t” infra moments I’ve lived through.\n\nCurious if anyone else has dealt with this.  \nDo you just accept that humans will always step in and clean it up later?  \nOr is there a better way people are handling the “who owns this when it breaks” part?\n\nWould love to hear how others are thinking about this, esp. folks actually running agents in prod.\n\nbtw not talking about AI doom or safety stuff, more like very boring “who’s on the hook” engineering anxiety 😅",

Tie that to RBAC scopes, not vibes.\n\n3) Change management: every new action pattern is a change with a ticket, reviewer, and rollback plan, like Terraform.\n\n4) Observability like you’d do for a junior SRE: audit log per agent, dashboards, alerts when behavior drifts.\n\nWe wired ours through tools like Temporal and Zapier first, then added stuff like Pulse alongside Datadog for monitoring discussions about our stack and even Slack/Linear to see where humans were still getting paged.\n\nYour main point is right: if you can’t answer “who decided this was acceptable,” you shouldn’t let the agent do it yet.",

Human or bot agent, the same deployment gates should be in place to keep a lot of the answers on \"who allowed this to happen\" right? I get that you said they're talking directly to APIs so I'm assuming gitops-style anything isn't happening, but maybe it would be a good idea. You maintain the same controls for deployment and focus hard there and it abstracts away the need to fret over every commit.\n\nIf my boss told me to automate everything with agents, those agents would be required to use our version control API to submit PRs and that's probably where I'd stop them. Have a human reviewer who scans the notes of the LLM agent specialized in code review pre-reviewing the change. I wouldn't abandon my perspectives on how to implement reliability just because the commits are coming from one source versus another.\n\nCreate a Staff+ Eng Agent to load up the whole codebase weekly and make broad suggestions for improvements. I'm just making shit up, sorry. But I really do think the same perspectives on CI/CD just become more important as things ship faster, not something to be avoided.\n\nEdit to add: I don't think the path forward is the best way to apply controls to LLM agents. But it's what I know and can reason about so it's where I start. I am super curious about what the future will look like: maybe all of this I just described can be abstracted and improved a layer further to allow even more speed and autonomy while maintaining appropriate change controls. I am very interested in what others think about it.",

Even wrote here a few times about previous attempts.  \n  \nAfter doing this for the better part of a year, got us to maybe 10% cost reduction. Rightsizing, killing idle capacity, requests/limits tuning, the usual janitorial work. After that every extra percent is a fight.\n\nOur workloads are quite bursty, HPA driven, mostly stateless. Nothing exotic. Multiple instance types, multiple AZs, TTLs tuned, PDBs not insane, images pre pulled, startup times are reasonable.\n\nWe recently moved from Cluster Autoscaler to Karpenter and I really hoped this would finally let us drop baseline capacity.\n\nStill doesn’t matter. We're not very well-utilized. Cluster utilization is mostly 20–50% CPU and memory Min replicas are pretty high. But no one wants to touch those as they are our safety net.\n\nMost solutions work very well on steady workloads that are polite enough to rise slowly and at constant intervals.

Like 2x Aurora replicas, or overprovisioning your DB instance size for max (as opposed to average) capacity, or cross-AZ and egress transfer costs.\n\nPPS: if you haven't already, allow Karpenter to use spot instances, and prioritize them (i.e. `[\"spot\", \"on-demand\"]`).\n\nWe've been running spot in production via Karpenter for about 1.5 years, some of it stateful workloads, and have had zero issues.  Largest prod cluster ~22 nodes, largest nonprod cluster ~30 nodes.  But works fine even in small 4-6 node clusters.",

What I didn't know is that the push came from no data insight but \"feelings\". We overshot saving by 20% of our minimum spend on the yearly contract, and it is a lot of money. To make it worse, said upper management then asked another team to increase spend artificially to not get uncomfortable questions from leadership.\n\nI am ranting, so back to the point: be data driven, be aware of business priorities, in a classic growth phase cost is not so important. Setting the road to easily achieve optimizations down the line is important, but you will need to explain it in a business context.",

Steady-state workloads are easy mode - you're playing on hard difficulty.\n\n  The \"no one wants to touch min replicas\" thing is the real issue, and it's not technical - it's organizational. Those replicas aren't a safety net, they're a trust problem. Teams don't trust the autoscaling to react fast enough, so they keep padding.\n\n  The only thing that's worked for me in similar situations:\n\n  1. **Make the cost of that \"safety\" visible** - \"This min replica buffer costs us $X/month\" hits different than \"we're at 30% utilization.\" I use CosmosCost (https://cosmoscost.com) to break this down in a way that's easy to show non-technical stakeholders - makes the conversation with leadership way easier.\n\n  2. **Run controlled experiments** - Lower min replicas on one non-critical service for a week, show nothing broke, use that as evidence\n\n  3. **Tie it to something leadership cares about** - 10% savings in raw dollars, annualized, in front of a CFO, suddenly gets attention\n\n  The crusade is worth it even if no one notices. You learned Karpenter, you understand your workload patterns, and you have data. That's career capital even if this company doesn't appreciate it.\n\n  Also: bursty workloads with high min replicas = someone got paged once at 3am and over-provisioned forever.

Not amazing, but manageable for a short migration window.\n\nDealing with the VPN config and the BGP settings in GCP was a nightmare. You never knew if you were being routed via their internal network or escaping into the WAN and if you got that wrong it would send you down a wild goose chase.\n\nMaybe not the most difficult thing I’ve done, but I spent two days staring at this and it drove me near crazy.",

Hence the board's trust issues. \n\nThe old school IT director, who would have done it your way, scoffed but my intent was to provide SSO for multiple legacy systems and I thought it was worth the extra effort to IDP auth in-house as a proof of concept. Eight years later with dev priorities focused on new systems and maintenance, there has never been enough time to deploy further, though. But that's on the radar for next year for certain as we need to centralize auth and deploy MFA. That's become an urgent security essential! (Weighing the option of migrating to OIDC, though.

          "text": "As it happens, a comment I made recently works:\n\nI worked for a financial lending company that wanted to lean into \"Big Data\" when it started becoming a buzzword a good decade or so ago. It started off small, maybe 5 or 6 AWS instances to run some processing and spit out some fancy data. No idea how it worked, I was the backend guy setting it up with Chef and automation. Well, then someone wanted a visualization of the data, so that got added. But then a new guy wanted a different visualization package, but the original one was in too wide a use (even though it wasn't actually in prod yet) to just replace, so now we had two separate big visualization and data processors sitting on top. Then they wanted to do a full mapreduce on it to further enrich the data or something, which required another whole big infrastructure on top of it using MapR. Then they wanted to export all that data to a couple big warehouses, again more than one because the team involved couldn't agree on one. In the end the 5 or 6 instances ballooned to over 100, all barely working properly and barely fitting together using my handspun chef and terraform setups. We'd spent over a million dollars up to that point and absolutely none of it was actually \"prod\", and the monthly costs of all the cloud infra plus license costs for all the bits and bobs was astronomical.\n\nAbout a year in the C-suite finally took notice and started looking into it. Turned out the relatively new senior manager who was heading up the plan was a cofounder and early investor or something in the main big data processor thing that got added in and was a major part of the expense. The whole thing was a giant mess and never worked properly. The manager was let go rather loudly, as well as a few folks he'd brought in, and the engineering department ended up having a big party where we tore down the whole infrastructure bit by bit. Imagine the Office Space fax machine scene except everyone was taking turns clicking Terminate on AWS instances. Even though I was the main engineer on the project handling the backend, basically everyone had been dragged into it at some point and had a vendetta. It probably ultimately cost a couple million that went nowhere, which wasn't immediately fatal but a decent chunk of money for a company our size. They ended up getting acquired a year or so later and I wouldn't be surprised if the fallout from this was part of why it was necessary.\n\nOne part of why it got this bad was my team, the syseng/devops/infrastructure/whatever they were calling it that week, didn't have a direct manager for a good couple years for various reasons. So I was basically at the whim of the other manager(s) and didn't have someone watching my back that I could report to even though I knew it was going south. And the senior manager guy had a lot of sway at the company so nobody really listened to me.",

I want to start building my own thing, but I’m honestly stuck at the *idea* stage.\n\nMost startup/product advice seems very app-focused (frontend, mobile apps, UX-heavy SaaS), and that’s not my background at all. I’m trying to understand:\n\n* What kinds of products actually make sense for someone with a DevOps / platform engineering background?\n* Has anyone here built something successful (or even just useful) starting from infra/automation skills?\n* Did you double down on infra tools, or did you force yourself to learn app dev?\n\nI’d love to hear real examples — even failed attempts are helpful.\n\nThanks!",

          "text": "I have a very similar background to yours, maybe with a bit more backend development experience. I've always enjoyed working in the infra space more than product/backend development. But at the same time, doing only operations was too boring for me so I wanted to eventually work on a hardcore infra product as a developer. But I lacked coding experience in Go (which is very common in the infra space) and some advanced skills required for building distributed systems.\n\nSo I joined a team building an internal developer platform on k8s. They paid me while I was honing the skills required for my next gig - win-win. After about a year there I felt confident enough to try something on my own.\n\nAt the same time, I was trying to pay attention to the things or workflows that annoyed me the most. And the largest one was the huge gap in the infra tooling between simple Docker deployments and full-blown k8s.\n\nI built and maintained infra long before containers were invented, then with containers, and of course k8s. It started bothering me that it became the norm in the industry to add so many layers of complexity to do basic things. Moreover, I needed simpler tools for my own projects and infra. It started bothering me so much that I decided to bite the bullet and try to do something about it.\n\nThese experiments and motivation led to the classic \"scratch your own itch\" turning into my 2 projects:\n\n* [https://github.com/psviderski/uncloud](https://github.com/psviderski/uncloud) (4.4K 🌟) - lightweight tool for deploying containerised apps across servers without k8s\n* [https://github.com/psviderski/unregistry](https://github.com/psviderski/unregistry) (4.5K 🌟) - push Docker images directly to remote servers without an external registry\n\nI believe focusing on solving your own problem rather than trying to come up with a perfect shiny idea is the most viable approach. This sounds obvious and this is true. That way you have the required motivation to see it through. It will sound cliche but if you want to build something beyond a hobby project, you need to be prepared that in most cases it's not a sprint, it's a marathon. There will be a lot of ups and downs and you have to be motivated enough to keep pushing it forward.\n\nAnother advantage that is crucial at the beginning when you don't have any users is that you are the user yourself and you know what specific problem needs to be addressed. This helps to make decisions and make progress. But this doesn't eliminate the need of talking to users once you have the first ones. It just accelerates the start and increases the chance of making at least something valuable and not giving up.\n\nThe biggest downside of building infra/dev tools is that developers are a very tough audience. We're not used to paying for tools and expect everything to be open source and free. And very often we have very unreasonable thinking like \"why would I pay $5 a month for a tool that I can build myself\" and eventually spending maybe $1000s of our time building it. Just because we have all the skills to do so, especially with the help of LLMs now.\n\nI haven't figured out a sustainable business model for Uncloud yet, it's hard and this is one of my top priorities at the moment. I can recommend the book The Developer Facing Startup by Adam Frankl on the topic of building a product for developers. A really good read to help better understand whether you want to get involved with this at all. Another gem is the Scaling Devtools Podcast: [https://scalingdevtools.com/](https://scalingdevtools.com/)\n\nLast but not least, LLMs help a lot with roasting your ideas, doing market research, and analysing existing solutions. Just feed in all your thoughts, goals, and doubts and chat about them to structure and refine them as well as finding flaws and better alternatives.\n\nHope this is helpful. Good luck!",

It usually has a pile of work to do and everything after it is “relaxed”. Then go help that team.\n\nThe costco food court is a great thought experiment. There’s order kiosks, various food prep stations, and someone shouting order numbers when all the “components” are assembled. Most of the time when I go the constraint is staff - incomplete orders pile up until someone is free to make a big batch of hot dogs and releases multiple orders at once. Other times the constraint is pizza - you can have someone crank out hotdogs, but you can’t rush the oven. Sometimes the constraint is the ordering kiosks, but that can be a good thing, as it “drip feeds” work into the rest of the system.",

The iOS app is in TestFlight.\n\nThe iOS app is written in Swift with UI kit and CoreData.\n\nThe webapp is Golang (chi, gorm, and sqlite) with Datastar and templ for the front end. Oauth isn't configured yet but you're free to sign up via email and poke around at my broken code.\n\nThere will be an Android version after I release.\n\nThis is basically my job. It generates no profit and I don't plan for it to for another 3 to 6 months (if it ever does). If someone outside my testing group even stumbles upon it they can't even be charged cash money because I haven't hooked up a payment system.\n\n> What kinds of products actually make sense for someone with a DevOps / platform engineering background?\n\nIMO, you don't HAVE to do something that fits your technical background. I am building a trip planning platform for hiking because, well, I love the outdoors and I'm hoping to build enough of a product market wedge around planning and gear management (vs trail curation like Alltrails and Komoot) that I can have a profitable business.\n\nIf it fails then I go back to being an SRE and several months of living expenses get subtracted from my savings.\n\nNot that I'm in the position to give the best advice but pick something you care about. Something that you can be consumed by. Something that you'll inherently dogfood because you're inherently the first user.\n\n> Has anyone here built something successful (or even just useful) starting from infra/automation skills?\n\nWhat defines success? What defines useful? My app currently does offline navigation either through building your own custom route or by uploading a GPX file (free feature). I currently actively use the alpha builds of the mobile app and the website to plan outdoor trips. I hope it's useful to more people when I actually get production builds out the door.\n\n> Did you double down on infra tools, or did you force yourself to learn app dev?\n\nThe thing is I already knew how to do most of this through hobbies and my career. I like programming and building and was constantly doing sideprojects in my free time. I had opportunities to write Go, Python, TypeScript, etc through my career so doing free lance app development isn't a strange shift.

I’m exploring a way to reduce EKS costs even further without rewriting everything from scratch without EKS.\n\n**Most advice (and what I’ve done before) clusters around:**\n\n- Spot + smart autoscaling (Karpenter, consolidation, mixed instance types)\n- Rightsizing requests/limits, bin packing, node shapes, and deleting idle workloads\n- Graviton/ARM where possible\n- Reduce cross-AZ spend (or even go single AZ if you can)\n- FinOps visibility (Kubecost, etc.) to find the real culprits (eg, unallocated requests)\n- “Kubernetes tax” avoidance: move some workloads to ECS/Fargate when you can\n\nBut even after doing all this, EC2 is just… Expensive.\n\n**So I'm playing around with a hybrid EKS cluster:**\n\n- Keep the managed EKS control plane in AWS\n- Run worker nodes on much cheaper compute outside AWS (e.g. bare metal servers on Hetzner)\n- Burst to EC2 for spikes using labels/taints + Karpenter on the AWS node pools\n\nAWS now offers “EKS Hybrid Nodes” for this, but the pricing is even more expensive than EC2 itself (why?), so I’m experimenting with a hybrid setup without that managed layer.\n\n**Questions for the crowd:**\n\n- Would you ever run production workloads on off-AWS worker nodes while keeping EKS control plane in AWS? Why/why not?\n- What’s the biggest deal-breaker: networking latency, security boundaries, ops overhead, supportability, something else?\n\nIf this resonates, I’m happy to share more details (or a small writeup) once I’ve cleaned it up a bit.",

You absolutely cannot run web servers locally as the response times are important. \n\nYou probably cannot run critical late night calculations because if those calculations do not finish, then it impacts daily metrics. \n\nThere is a small pocket of work that can be done over a long amount of time that can actually be done on people’s machines but you’ll need to build the infrastructure for that. When I say infrastructure I don’t mean K8s but the frontend and backend to ensure things are resilient and work properly. This reminds me of the @home protein folding and SETI. For those kind of workloads, it makes sense. For a business, I don’t know if it does considering you can spin up spot instances as necessary for fractions of the price. Also, data compliance could be an issue. \n\nI don’t see how it could be worth the squeeze but if the data crunching is enough and you have enough spare machines, and the server costs are a deal breaker, I can see it but most businesses won’t consider it realistically.",

          "text": "tl;dr: Always remember to go that extra mile to cover your ass.\n\nI was moonlighting automation jobs a long time ago to pay off my student loans. One of my first contracts was automating the creation of ephemeral dev environments. I had something ready to demo pretty quickly, but the company was in another country and there was 8+ hour lag time on communications. The guy that hired me sent me server credentials to demo the automation and said the machine was safe for testing. Ahem, IT WAS NOT SAFE.\n\nI got middle of the night panic emails because the server was supporting their customers. They couldn't call as I didnt think to give them my phone number and they didn't ask. Part of the ephemeral-ness was cleaning up databases. Uh, that includes cleaning up old databases.\n\nFor whatever reason I thought maybe I should backup the database they had before doing my thing. Immediately when I saw their email (I was a night owl and saw it pretty quickly), I restored their DB and emailed them back. They said it's working again (I never found out what \"it\" was), paid out my contract, and I never heard from them again. They ghosted me and didn't want delivery of anything.\n\nEven though they paid me I was still panicking. What if my actions cost them a fuckload of money and they came after me? I had receipts of emails asking \"are you sure XYZ is okay for testing?\" which might help in a lawsuit. Regardless, I immediately entrenched myself in best business practices before taking any other work. Got my first LLC and an umbrella liability insurance policy for contract work. In hindsight, it was nice to learn such a valuable lesson so quickly. That fear of \"what if there's a fuck up\" has helped me throughout my career.\n\nI haven't done any freelance in over a decade now and I'm sure it's a bit tougher to find those straight forward devops jobs. But the hussle is always admirable. Best of luck OP.",

Script your first cron job day 1.\n\n2) Python/Bash - automate tickets first (API calls to Jira/PagerDuty). Saved my sanity.\n\n3) Observability: Prometheus/Grafana/Loki stack. Alerts teach systems thinking\n\n4) IaC - Terraform for infra. Git repo all state. (IMO you should skip k8s til year 2)\n\n5) CI/CD - GitHub Actions/ArgoCD. Deploy your own stuff.\n\nWatch out for the burnout because it can get real. Get proper sleep and live a balanced life (dont smoke/drink, eat right and cut toxic people from your life)",

          "text": "Disclaimer - There's no One-Size-Fits-All SRE solutions, but there are some common patterns. Here is how I'd orient on what _Your Company's_ urgent need _areas_ are, from SRE.\n\nFirst, determine what your priorities are by learning about the engineering team, and where they spend their time. Put work they are doing into one of these buckets, by how much work tasks take and how often they comes up:\n\n|    |     |     |\n| :- | :- | :- |\n|    |  Fast / Low-Toil | Slow / High-Toil |\n| Frequent | P2 | P1 |\n| Rarely     | P4 | P3 |\n\nP1 means top priority, P4 is lowest priority _(and P2/P3 are kinda tied, but I hate ties so address frequent issues first if there are no other considerations)_.\n\nIf your team is tasked like mine, you'll be looking at tasks related to the following, so maybe day 1 ask your boss at a top level how they's _generally_ sort these 4 items into the 4 buckets (of the matrix) above.\n\n- Observability (logs/metrics/tracing) & troubleshooting [eg, Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Open Telemetry tracing]\n- Incident response & postmortems [eg, creating and maintaining alert rules, on-call schedules, notification channels to Slack or ICs' Pager devices]\n- Cluster provisioning & management [Terraform to provision, Kubernetes to orchestrate/manage]\n- Change Management Safety [CI/CD deploy pipelines, rollback plans, disaster recovery plans]\n\nIf any of those topics just Don't Exist at your company, it might do to assume they're Rarely / High-Toil (they aren't happening often enough to be a real issue, yet, but when they come up there's probably not a lot of tooling support backing up the work).\n\nAnd from there, you have a 20k-foot map of what you're dealing with. From there, find some projects for each of the areas, offer your \"SRE Prioritization\" score and put them in front of your boss / some product owner to see where they want to start. As for specific tools and projects, I think other posters have good ideas here already - but I also encourage you to start reviewing the [CNCF landscape and blogs](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/11/05/beginners-guide-cncf-landscape/) (assuming you are, like many of us, a cloud hosted start-up), this can give you nudges towards popular technology (which tends to be popular for SOME reason).\n\nedit: Also, naw, don't drop out - having a diploma is an objective advantage in this field in the long run, whereas leaving school to get a 1-2y head-start in the field means, compared to your classmates you'll have 1-2 years experience - but you won't be competing for jobs against them, they're entry-level. Now you're competing for jobs against people with 1-2 years experience, AND diplomas. The smart move is, honestly, maybe link up with a professor you think may have insights into SRE work and keep them in the loop on your project work - it may have no benefit/impact on the job, BUT it might get them excited and they may be able to connect you with other interesting infrastructure work or business contacts. (imo, a lot of people who discount a diploma don't see that the diploma is less valuable than the access to a big professional network you can potentially gain via your professors)",

IaC with an SDLC is about managing the lifecycle and state of resources, not generally for the purpose of “fire and forget“ operations. There are still some stateful configurations that I would not manage in IaC. For instance: Okta group and app assignments should happen based on Group Rules as much as possible, but there will always be plenty of cases where a user has to be manually assigned to a group. Unless there was some edge case caveat that required it, I would not manage bespoke group assignments for users in Terraform.

          "text": "The single biggest reason I ever use ClickOps is because my CSP (AWS) is likely to automatically automate creation of most of the supporting infrastructure through ClickOps but not through IaC. For example, the web EC2 launch flow will walk me through creating everything from security group to VPC to IAM role / policy, key attachments, etc etc. Versus with Terraform, I would have to define every single one of these resources verbosely as separate blocks, often requiring two resources per soas to perform attachments.\n\nSo it is definitely quicker for me to spin up an EC2 instance using ClickOps as compared to using Terraform, which leads to my using ClickOps for incredibly self-contained one-off tests (usually in separate “sandbox” sub account from production infrastructure). As soon as I am ready to productionize something, it moves to IaC and I eat the cost of writing all of the resource definitions / attachments, accept that this makes my work more auditable / reproducible / controlled.\n\nOther reasons people may opt for ClickOps over IaC:\n- easier to get off the ground; if I’m “learning AWS”, i may be following AWS-specific tutorials that tell you to use console and never even mention Terraform.\n- may require less permissions; integrating with an org’s existing IaC often requires greater permissions than using ClickOps — read/write to state, permissions to interact with existing projects, etc.\n- always quicker for one off tasks — indeed, I have used click ops once or twice for production cases in the past ~year as a breakglass mechanism to support emergency temporary workarounds eg temporary policy attachments. Not a massive auditability issue thanks to CloudTrail\n\nTL;DR IaC is almost always better for production-ready, reviewed, reusable infrastructure. ClickOps is quicker to spin up incredibly small self-contained resources with few interdependencies.",

So when someone just needs a bucket, a queue, or a one-off change, the console feels faster—and often *safer*—than touching a brittle pipeline they don’t fully understand.\n\nMost teams I’ve seen don’t reject IaC outright; they stall somewhere along the way on **usability**. Core infrastructure is codified, but day-2 changes, experiments, and exceptions quietly fall back to the UI.\n\nA big part of this is that tools like Terraform, Pulumi, Ansible (hell, even Kubernetes) are often treated *as the platform*, rather than tools for building one. That shifts a lot of operational responsibility and domain knowledge onto developers, even though cloud APIs themselves are a messy mix of ops and app concerns.\n\nUntil infrastructure workflows are genuinely easier than the console for non-experts, ClickOps is going to keep winning in practice.\n\nI wrote more about why IaC adoption seems stuck, would love to hear others thoughts.

I see commenters saying they like to use it for prototyping, POC, etc. Honestly, I find terraform to be simpler and I don't use AWS web gui for all that much. If the POC turns into something we might intend to keep around, we're going to want to turn it into IaC anyway, just do it up front. It's not a lot of work, you have auto-complete in most modern editors, and co-pilot if you swing that way.\n\n  \nEdit: The lack of peer-review and reproducibility is enough reason to outright ban ClickOps in my opinion. I don't think there is any good reason for anyone who is not a super-admin to have access to ClickOps for cloud services.",

My current certs are heavily AWS and Elastic focused, the new ones I'm looking at are Kubernetes and Hashicorp related primarily with potentially an AWS one as well. \n\nI'd also say (Contrary to the folks telling you not to do certs) if you're employed and your employer is going to pay for you to do certs, just do it. If you're getting the time paid to study and the cost of the study materials and exams covered by your company just do the stuff that's interesting and do it even if it doesn't directly benefit you in the immediate term, then worst case you don't renew them if you move / projects change etc etc. IMHO you'd be silly to not take advantage if a company is giving you time and budget to study. If you're doing it off your own back then find your own rules like I have for what certs you'll consider / look at and which ones you'll write off and be cool with letting certs lapse that have no relevance to your current or future work.",

That makes debugging, learning, and using AI much easier.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1. How do you decide what’s worth learning to really grow professionally?\n2.

As does a security standard such as NIST 800-53. You could spend your life and not get to the bottom of either. You’ll also get to the point where you’ll be able to recognise other domains and be familiar with the principles.\n\nWith AI, most businesses are enabling by subscribing to platforms such as Azure Foundry or SAP Business AI or similar. They come with models and update them reasonably regularly. They will show you how to create agents to use cases. Play around with the models enough and you’ll get to HuggingFace and Unsloth etc and weighting models to create your own (they’re not really new, as in you’re not creating them from scratch like the big foundation labs). Understanding the principles is more important because they evolve so quickly -  these past few weeks the buzz has been about Claude Code, Manus, Gemini 3 etc.\n\nHope that helps.",

The more you rely on a specific domain of knowledge at work, the more you should be diving into it. Being excellent at those things is literally your job. \n\nThen from there when you hear of a tool or technology you should find out what problems it solves, and determine if it actually solves any problems for you. If it does, learn it at a shallow level. If not, ignore it. For example ArgoCD doesn't appear to solve any problems for me, as the problems it solves, I've already solved in other ways using my existing CI systems. I'm not going to learn to use a tool that doesn't benefit me yet even if it is very popular. I understand what it does and why it doesn't benefit me right now, and that is enough.\n\nFor you, you want to learn Golang. So what problems does Golang solve that Python doesn't? I actually have a bias toward Golang, and against Python. But ask yourself what paint points you experience from Python, and how Golang handles those better (if better.) And then when you go to learn Golang, you'll of course want to learn the syntax and general styling guidelines, but beyond that you'll really want to focus on the specific features that improve on the pain points you experienced in Python.\n\nThat's basically how you go about prioritizing topics, IMHO. But the hard part is learning them. For me, books are slow and verbose, and tech articles are filled with annoying self-aggrandizement. The only real way for me to learn something is to do it. Build a project on the thing you're learning. And for the love of god don't just use an AI chatbot to do the project for you. Start by reading the documentation. Get your own work together. If you get stuck for an extended period of time without progress, try the chatbots, but then take its output and figure out how the output works with the documentation. And then fix what the chatbot output because usually it will tell you how to do something horribly incorrectly, but with just enough accuracy to seem like it'll work.",

          "text": "hey. 15 years of automation experience starting from Selenium Core and all the way through to Playwright. Now a DevOps. \n\nAs others said - there's multiple issues. First and most important is leadership/managerial. If you have time to slow down a bit, investigate and improve - good. Count this almost solved. If the speed of development will grow - it's almost a lost cause. \n\nSecond is budget. I have multiple experiences when parallelising causes flakiness. Test infra simply doesn't cope and often there's no monitoring to see this. Look for DB connection pool exhaustion, look for DB load, look for compute and memory resources. A few years ago we hit a very painful wall. We had to significantly increase compute for TEST DB server. There's 20 people working there (testers, devs, analysts) and 25 test runners. That's on par with average production user count at the time. This costs money and escalates quickly. We also had to clean up the DB continuously.\n\nThird, platform settings. Once we sort DB issues out, we hit an obscure ingress/nginx/cdn issue which caused some requests to fail. Found similar issue by accident on Nginx github and found which config was stupidly low. We hit this only by running 25 tests in parallel and hit a connection limit. \n\nFourth, smart tests. A lot depends on testability of the system and often you can't change it. Aim at smaller tests, but do connect them in logical dependencies. Often an antipattern... but hey, most likely all system under tests is a book of antipatterns. Aim at test re-runs by the test runner framework. Find flaky places and add retries around them. Replace shitty form submission with REST calls to same API. \n\nFifth and last, prioritise and \"quarantine\" flaky tests. Move them to a parallel pipeline that won't block the release. Take a look at failures as they come. Fix if needed. Obviously this relates to secondary functionality that is not critical and/or not used frequently. \n\ngood luck 👋",

This means you have something non-deterministic in your tests. You need to isolate what the root cause for each failure is and figure out where the non-determinism is coming from. \n\nI spent a bunch of effort improving the reliability of tests for my UI team because it was causing a massive productivity loss and general unhappiness within the team. Issues we'd been living with for a very long time. You'll be amazed what a couple of people taking a week to focus on it can achieve. Our pipeline now almost never fails outside of a genuine issue. Some things were very simple like adding a script which waits for the server to have finished bundling properly before Cypress tests start. Some things were more complex like adding a wrapper which fails any test which attempts to access an external resource so we could identify where mocks had been missed. A final thing was moving all the pipeline jobs to be container based so we had more reliable compute resource and configuration.\n\nSecondly, you have performance. There's no reason tests should be slow. \n\nI don't have much experience with UI testing, but common mistakes I've seen countless times on backend software is using sleep operations to advance time. They're unreliable and slow, and often are both more reliable and faster if you have a mock clock you can advance and semaphores to handle multi-threaded conditions. On the UI side you can also get a handle on things like timers and manually advance them by specific time increments to assert behaviours. \n\nStart with your slowest test and identify where the time is being spent. You'll probably find patterns that apply to many more tests. \n\nParallelism is a good final step, but it's worth ironing out any big test performance issues before just making it parallel. You want the tests to be fast so developers can run them quickly and easily without having to wait for the pipeline to tell them they broke something. \n\nInvestment in test stability and performance easily pays itself off, especially when you have a decent sized team and you're already losing lots of time to it. \n\nFrom a prioritisation point of view, it's one of the non-discretionary jobs in my mind. We don't ask the business for permission to do this kind of work, we just do it. I will pad out how long other features are going to take to deliver, or push back start dates on features, to make the time for these tasks.",

They should run on specific branches (e.g., the trunk branch) or on specific stages (e.g., deployment)\n\nBecause you want to run tests on what the merge result is *going* to be. If you only run tests on trunk (such as a nightly test run), you will inevitably end up with broken code being merged into it - which means it can't be used as the base for further development until it has been fixed. Might be fine for a one-person team, but it quickly turns into a serious problem with larger teams.\n\nThe feedback loop doesn't **have** to be 40 minutes for the developers, though. They should also be able to run the same test suite locally, which should hopefully run an awful lot faster. If it already passes locally, then it should be pretty much a guarantee that it also passes in CI.\n\nCombine that with a [merge queue](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-a-merge-queue) and that 40-minute CI runtime becomes essentially irrelevant.\n\nOf course, that only works when your tests are actually deterministic.

When you're seeing failures every run that move around, it's usually not \"selectors are flawed\" so much as the system (tests, env, pipeline) isn't deterministic yet, and the suite has become an untrustworthy gate. \n\nIf it helps, here's some steps that might help get signal and apply fixes:\n\nWhat do the failures look like?\n- are they timeout, stale elements, element not found, assert mismatches, navigation, 5xx/network, browser crashes?\n- do they cluster around particular areas (login, search, checkout etc.) or are they truly random? \n- is there correlation with parallelism level, runner type, time of day or specific envs? \n\nHow deterministic is the state/data?\n- are tests sharing users/data? Or does each test have its own data and cleanup? \n- are you setting a state via API/setup hooks (fast, consistent), or driving everything through the UI (slow, fragile)?\n\nHow stable is the environment/ infrastructure?\n- shared ling lived environment vs isolation per run?\n- real external dependencies involved (auth/email/payments) vs stubs?\n- any signs of runner starvation (CPU/memory) or environment bottlenecks?\n\n\nAnd what you can do with the answers:\n1. Add a tiny bit of observability to the suite\n    - start tagging failures with a simple reason code: timing/wait, data collision, env instability, infra starvation, selectors/DOM, real bug.\n    - track two numbers per test: flake rare and runtime contribution\n    - you'll usually find a small set of tests/ specs causing a disproportionate chunk of pain\n\n2. Fix the gate design (so you stop paying the full cost on every PR):\n    - 650 tests (on every PR)some/ most/ all being ui e2e is effectively saying \"everything is critical\"\n    - should split these into tiers:\n      - PR gate: fast checks and a small UI smoke/ critical path subset\n      - broader e2e: larger critical set and the full regression in a separate lane.\n    - add a quarantine policy: flaky tests don't block merges, but stay visible and owned. Otherwise \"rerun-to-green\" becomes the workflow.\n\n3. Attack the usual flake sources:\n    - data isolation: unique data per test/ run, avoid shared accounts, make setup/teardown idempotent.\n    - deterministic synchronisation: remove sleeps, wait for the app states/events, assert in stable states. \n    - reduce shared environment interference: minimise cross-test coupling, stabalise/stub the most unreliable external does where it's appropriate\n\n4. treat speed separately from reliability:\n    - once the above is under control, you can revisit the speed (sharing, controlled parallelism, better runners).\n    - if you ever consider swapping tooling for speed/ ergonomics, it can help, but it's best treated as an investment decision AFTER you've nailed whether flake is env/data/infra vs test code.\n\nI'm also of the opinion (and I know it's not always shared) that retries aren't the best solution - a single retry can be a temporary mitigation for known transient infra hiccups, but if reruns are the normal path to green, it teaches everyone to ignore red builds. \n\nIf you're able to share one or two representative failure tipes (timeout vs stale element vs assertion vs network), it's usually possible to tell pretty quickly whether you're looking at data/env/infra instability or test design issues\n\n\nAs a side note: screw writing things this long on the mobile app again 😂😭",

Also using browserstack etc to test different browsers.    \n- Have good test reports / reproduceability for developers to fix bugs afterwards. I built own test framework that \"marked\" / coloured clicked / selected elements and removed color on next click. Made it clear whhat was selected and if something wrong was selected.      \n- Bonus to prior. Have code coverage tool if posible. Being able to see what code is hit by what tests also help narrow down bug fixing.        \n- Use best practice / patterns builting E2E tests.

          "text": ">Rotating everything constantly is not realistic\n\nWhen you say \"not realistic\", what you actually mean is \"too much effort\".\n\nUltimately this all comes down to hygiene and process:\n\n1. Shared access to anything should be removed wherever possible. Every dev gets their own credentials to everything. Why are you using shared API keys? Everyone gets their own. \n\n2. Where shared access is absolutely unavoidable, then the scope must be limited and access-controlled wherever possible. Password managers, or JIT logins, etc. Having a single password vault which everyone can access is only slightly better than having a shared document with everything written on it.\n\n3. Credentials used by systems must be secured/encrypted. Devs cannot be using the API key that the finance service uses to talk to the mailing service, or logging into the database with the authentication service's password. Every service has its own credentials, stored securely and not visible to anyone who does not have direct access to the machine running the service. \n\n4. Have a rock-solid onboarding and offboarding process, automated and cross-checked as much as possible to ensure that credentials are created and deleted appropriately. If devs get access to systems by asking their teammates to create credentials, then you're in trouble.\n\n5. Rotate credentials. This only difficult when you never designed your systems to accomodate it. But once you do it the first time, you now know how to do it. Doing it automatically then becomes easy.\n\n6. Audit. Create scripts and dashboards to scan logs and databases looking for new logins by old keys, sending emails to remind you (and everyone else) that their keys need to be rotated, automatically disabling old keys, looking for usage of credetnials belonging to former employees, etc, etc. This is the one I used to hate because a regular old script which connects to a DB, searches records, parses all the data, formats it, and sends emails, is easy but boring as hell. It's a day's work that you don't wanna do. LLMs spit it out for me in an hour.",

The prod config is literally only accessed during a production build via a service token, and every key has a companion in the other configs.\n\nThe dev config is where the magic happens, because we can fork the config. So when we need to give access to a key to someone, what we actually do is fork the dev config, generate new tokens just for their config, and then the doppler runtime wrapper automatically loads their keys at runtime instead of the main dev config. We configured it so they can get a short-lived access token to obtain their keys. They have to refresh the token daily to maintain access, and we can destroy the forked dev config at any time.\n\nOn our side, we are generating keys and forking configs.

If our user’s account was blocked, all keys given out to that user were canceled. For very short term contractors, they used their own OAuth source, eg. their work account or personal email account, and we could cancel their keys in the app. Long term contractors got an account in our 365.\n\nKeys given to people were always temporary, and all of them would auto-expire. They were also revocable in our app. So any dev could cancel a key they got handed out but didn’t need anymore.\n\nKeys given to automation were issued as secrets directly to the GitHub account. Most of the time at least. Then, the dev never saw them nor had to copy-paste them anywhere. If a dev needed a key for access from their desktop IDE or scripts, they could get one via the app, but that was on the rarer side.\n\nThe app had templates for commonly needed sets of keys. So if something needed 5 different API keys, they could be issued as a bundle, and canceled/revoked as a bundle.\n\nPutting API keys issued from the app in chats or anything like that was not allowed. For our teams and slack we added automation that detected valid API keys in posts and anonymized them.\n\nWe generally did not allow keys from 3rd parties that couldn’t be revoked at least in a semi-automated way. If someone was giving us a demo key, we could put it in the app together with the email of the issuer. If the app needed to revoke the key, it’d shoot an email to the issuer and open a case so someone had to follow up on it. A vendor or two gave us self-revocable demo/evaluation keys that you could revoke via their api. We would add those api calls to the app so it was automated.\n\nIn general, our mantra was that every key was handed out by the app to a person, and we had a current inventory of any valid (non-revoked) keys issued to any person and/or repository.\n\nThis was on the dev/test side of things. Prod had its own key issuance api. There too we could cancel any and all keys deployed, and had an inventory.\n\nI got the MVP for that app written over a couple of weekends and then others took up maintenance/enhancements. It was a lifesaver several times. And we weren’t a big company either, less than 50 people.",

Some services have this features built-in (think AWS' assume-role) some will never have it (think some random ftp server).\n\nTangentially: one of the things I have on my todo list and will be pushing for is fido/u2f security keys (think yubikey). If I can manage to bridge AWS with Google Workspace for authentication and force more services to login via google (either directly or through keycloak) that should be fixed.\n\nThat being said: api keys should always have an expiration that's machine readable (in the sense that when you load the key, the library should be able to emit a warning about the api key expiring in like ~30 days or whatever). This should either be part of the key (think jwt tokens) or part of the API you're consuming (this of course makes sense if you are the one emitting the api key and receiving requests - in this case you should have an endpoint to check for api key validity).\n\n\nOne more sidenote: IIRC stackoverflow had a policy that if an api key was sent to some endpoint in plaintext (http rather than https) then the key was assumed to be compromised as it had traveled over an insecure channel and immediately invalidated. The user had then to provision a new api key and MAKE SURE to only call api endpoints over https.",

I don't know his arguments for, but I am painfully familiar with the arguments against that model:\n\n- It mis-distributes pain. If an engineering team is creating services that are unstable, insecure, unscalable, unmaintainable, unmonitoriable, they are creating pain for the company. The fastest route to resolve and avoid that pain is to direct it to the people with the ability to fix it.\n\n- It creates broken workflows. An ops team that's experiencing that pain needs to beg for the attention of the relevant dev team to fix it. This will usually get drowned out in the sea of requests from product, until something breaks so badly that the request goes all the way up the chain to a vp or cto and then back down.\n\n- It institutionalizes brokenness. This is how you end up with the service that crashes at 3am every day, with a cron job the ops team put in place to restart it at 2:55am every day because they could never get anyone to actually fix it. A cron job that will then linger on as mystery lore for years, whether or not it's still necessary, even after the person who put it in place is long gone.",

I see a lot of people go cloud first, and then they wonder why costs and dev time increase. Lack of local dev/test envs in cloud-first companies is a smell (and a cost driver)\n\nThe main reason why you need devops is to close the feedback loop faster, observe issues in prod, have the ability to fix them. If it's more people then you have comms overheads, approvals, priority of feature work against maintenance\n\nWhat does advocacy entail? Can you have a mixture of both worlds? Which devops practices are essential? I find if 10 people are given a reasonable environment to work in, there's hardly anything to object to. If there is a well developed testing trategy and a meeting to adjust priorities every few weeks, the devops role is somewhat of a QA and strategic planning, the question is what you should do less of and what you should do more of?",

IMO, the issue with this structure is generally that Ops is treated as the tool of Devs and bossed around.\n\nBut the way this actually can work is if you Ops gets to make decisions that improve their lives and Devs get to make decisions that improve their lives.  For example, Ops should be able to impose outage budgets, and if product Devs ship exceeds that, Devs are restricted in what they can do until the budget is earned back (could be they operate their software themselves, could be they aren't allowed to release anything outside of fixes or something, up to you to negotiate).  Other things are that Ops can impose architectural decisions on Devs.  Like if you want Ops to run it, you gotta use app servers + postgresql + an LB on AWS, and it must fit into a certain template.\n\nAll that is to say, if you are arguing \"traditional\" vs \"modern\" and \"modern\" is better, that is not very compelling, but if you are arguing how something helps the business, that is better.  And sometimes what helps the business is Devs not having to learn how to do Ops.",

My role is mostly operational — setting up and tweaking YAMLs, running cloud operations on Azure, keeping applications stable, handling container and web application deployments, troubleshooting lower env and production issues, fixing pipeline failures and build issues, and working closely with multiple DevOps teams. I also manage monitoring and observability using Datadog and Splunk.\n\nI don’t usually build CI/CD pipelines from scratch or create Kubernetes clusters end to end — my work is more about operations, reliability, and incremental improvements rather than greenfield builds.\n\nI have around 11 years of experience, earn a good salary, and hold certifications including Azure Architect, GCP ACE, Terraform, and AWS Associate. On paper things look fine, but lately I feel stuck career-wise. I don’t feel like I’m moving up anymore, either in responsibility or role scope.\n\nI’d especially love to hear from senior, staff, or principal engineers (or managers who’ve coached people at that level): how did you break out of this kind of plateau, and what changes actually made a difference?\n\nI’m curious — has anyone else been in a similar situation at this stage of their career?\n\nWhat did you do to move forward?\n\nAny advice or perspectives would be really appreciated.",

That said, once you move past basic usage, the combination of IAM complexity, cost attribution, and compliance-related questions adds a non-trivial amount of cognitive overhead. For context, our requirements are fairly standard: VMs, networking, backups, and some basic automation,,, nothing particularly exotic.\n\nBecause we’re EU-focused, I’ve been benchmarking a few non-hyperscaler setups in parallel, mostly as a sanity check to understand tradeoffs rather than as a migration plan. One of the environments I tested was a Swiss-based IaaS (Xelon), primarily to look at API completeness, snapshot semantics, and what day-2 operations actually feel like compared to AWS.\n\nThe experience was mixed in predictable ways: fewer abstractions and less surface area, but also a smaller ecosystem and less polish overall. It did, however, make it easier to reason about certain operational behaviors.\n\nIdk what the “right” long-term answer is, but I’m interested in how others approach this in practice: Do you default to hyperscalers until scale demands otherwise, or do you intentionally optimize for simplicity earlier on?\n",

The special part about it is that the OS is heavily stripped down and fine tuned specifically for k8s use and is only manageable via a custom API, meaning it doesn't even have SSH etc.. But once it's installed, it also provides the default k8s API, so you basically have two administrative endpoints on different ports, one for Talos (the OS) and one for the K8s API.\n\nWe are in the process of switching from bare metal which we managed with Ansible (\\~90 servers) and with the new k8s cluster, we still use Ansible for boostrapping and Talos configuration management. Since Talos configuration is all yaml, we can utilize Ansible dictionaries. Basically, we wrote a base Talos config and set up overlays for controlplanes, shared worker config, storage-workers, db-workers and compute workers and depending on the node type. The whole cluster configuration is in the repo and the secrets are encrypted via ansible-vault. When bootstrapping/configuring a node, the specific config for that node gets rendered from the templates/overlays and then applied.\n\nI'm sure we could optimize some stuff but for now, we're pretty happy with our setup, we can upgrade by just changing one value and running one playbook and add new nodes by just creating another VM which has booted from a Talos ISO, add it to an Ansible group and the playbook does the rest.",

It’s obviously not trying to be everything for everyone, but for straightforward VM-based setups, that clarity is actually a big win.",

While DO doesn't have a lot of the more complex services, I was amazed at how much simpler they make everything.  There's a cost estimate built in to the web form for anything you build.  Your estimated monthly cost is at the top of the page.  Standard instance compute was more or less equal in price to EC2, but like a GPU instance is about a fifth the price.  You don't really see anyone posting on Reddit about the time they accidentally ran up $10K in charges on DO and there's a reason for that.\n\nThe next time I get roped in to another startup, I think I'll take on the challenge of building out a less complex infra for as long as I can.  Even the TF for DO is an order of magnitude simpler (granted, I haven't tried doing anything interesting yet like instance roles or conditional logic).  I wish there was more of a serverless approach available, as I've gotten used to the idea of not really worrying about scaling (for some things).  But DO could do at least half of what my $250K/mo org is doing in AWS and it would be significantly cheaper and less complex (if we didn't have to refactor every line of AWS service-specific code in our platforms).",

One needs to think those through.\n2. Someone else should have reviewed this before it even hit staging. And for them, see 1.\n3. There is a shortcoming in the way load is tested. Without more details it's impossible to be more specific, but I am sure you have already figured it out.\n4. A migration like this should have had a push button rollback. Like Blue/Green, etc.\n   1.  If you were really fancy it would have happened automatically. But from your description it's probably not worth the effort and added complexity for your needs.\n5. It would be nice to have a phased rollout as well, but if you aren't really set up for that it isn't going to fit into such a short timetable. And it may not be worth the effort for your needs.\n6. Migrations are high risk, don't even do them without a damn good demonstrable reason. And never do them to be \"better\". This is mentioned as a principle, which is similar to ,\"never gold plate things\". In this case it sounds like you probably had a direct benefit of reduced cost.",

So far I’ve peeped into Docker and I got comfortable with using Linux, but it’s not so easy for me to do project based learning, since you need some general knowledge of what the problems are in DevOps. I don’t struggle with finding projects on technology I already know because I know what it can do and what it can’t do. But I’m barely touching the tip of the iceberg here! DevOps seems like such a huge rabbit hole, but it seems very interesting and I do want to learn more about it.\n\nAll help is much appreciated!",

But when the customer comes in and needs their front brakes replaced, you’re not sure what to do.\n\nYou can learn about multimeters and oxygen sensors and oil recyclers and check valves, but none of these help you replace brake pads. The senior tech leans on your impact driver skills to take the tire off, then they handle the brake pads. You could have the biggest toolbox in the shop, but that is not what makes a mechanic good.\n\nThe entirety of devops is trying to optimize for a single unsolvable problem. Until you know what the problem is, you will be beaten by the guy with a set of walmart wrenches, a roll of shop rags, and a can of carb cleaner.\n\nI would read “The Unicorn Project” first. I read it third, but I think it’s the easiest read and the most applicable. From there, if you want to get deeper into the theory, read “The Goal”, or if you want to lean more towards application (though still somewhat theory re “types of problems/strategies/tools” moreso than specific tools) read “The DevOps Handbook”. It’s the driest book but the most solid and actionable.\n\nSomeday you will see a problem, and you will know what strategy to apply, and you will say “I wish there was a tool that did X” - and it will be only a few google searches away. There might even be a guide that tells you what settings to use. The new guys will wonder how you brought a toolbox so big; and maybe you have some familiar tools you’ve had for a while, but for the most part you don’t even know a tool exists until you have a problem that needs solving. They’ll ask how you memorized all 1200 docker flags, but you didn’t memorize any, you found what you needed based on what you needed.\n\nI cannot recommend the old school books enough. For less than a McDonalds visit they can be hand delivered to your front door in less than two days.",

It isn't about specific technologies, it's about the underlying reasons those technologies are used; so Docker vs Podman, Xunit vs NUnit, Jenkins vs Team City, AWS vs Azure etc, none of these decisions specifically matter as long as you choose one of the solutions to do the job that they take care of.  Check out Dave Farley's excellent YouTube channel Modern Software Engineering where they dig into all of these decision points and explain why they are important in the DevOps chain.  His guests alone read like the who's who of the last 30 years of software dev authorship and keynote presentations.  Dr Nicole Forsgren is another key speaker in this area, author of the Accelerate and Frictionless books, co-founder of DORA publishing their State of DevOps' reports for the last decade, former VP of Research at Github and current head of Microsoft's Developer Experience Lab.",

The point is that enterprise is super slow when (and bad at) adopting new things and if you leave it to the client, they will end up churning because they won’t do shit and 4 years time they will tell you they don’t want to pay for product they don’t use. You send your FDEs, they build and migrate whatever is needed quickly so that the client is now forced to use the company’s product and cannot easily leave.\n\nEdit: will it stay for a long time? Yes, firstly because this is not something that the AI companies came up with.

      "text": "Wrote a blog about where I feel the [cloud ecosystem is heading in 2026](https://metalbear.com/blog/cloud-trends-2026/). Here's a summary of the blog: \n\n\n1. The AI Vibe Check \n\nThe \"just add AI\" honeymoon phase is ending. At KubeCon London, sessions were packed based on buzzwords alone. By Atlanta, the mood shifted to skepticism. In 2026, organizations will stop chasing the hype wagon and start demanding proof of ROI, better security audits, and a clear plan for Day 2 operations before integrating AI features.\n\n2. Kubernetes Moves to the \"Back Seat\"\n\nKubernetes is no longer the star of the show and is more like the engine under the hood. We’re seeing a massive surge in adoption of projects like Crossplane, kro, and Kratix. Platform teams are moving away from forcing developers to touch K8s primitives, instead favoring abstractions and self-service APIs. The goal for 2026: developer experience (DevEx) that hides the complexity of the cluster.\n\n3. The Death of Local Dev Environments\n\nLocal environments can’t keep up with modern cloud complexity or the speed of AI coding agents. The \"slow feedback loop\" (waiting for CI/Staging) is the new bottleneck. 2026 will be the year of production-like cloud dev environments. \n\n4. The \"Specific\" AI SRE\n\nWe aren't at the \"autopilot cluster\" stage yet. While tools like K8sGPT and kagent are gaining ground, we won't see general-purpose AI managing entire clusters. Instead, 2026 will favor task-specific agents with limited scope and strict permissions. It’s about empowering SREs, not replacing them.\n\n5. Open Source Fatigue\n\nOrganizations are hitting a saturation point with overlapping CNCF projects. In 2026, the \"cool factor\" won't be enough to drive adoption. Teams are becoming hyper-selective, prioritizing long-term maintainability, community health, and clear roadmaps over whatever is currently trending on GitHub.",

So that, coupled with nerves, might make me choke on the spot when asked.   \n\nI'm thinking there's got to be a refresher devops course that touches a little on everything.    \n\nI have an technical interview next week.

I've been in DevOps for \\~11 years, and interviews are a very different skill from doing the actual job.\n\nWhat has worked for me most of the time (not perfectly, but often enough):  \n\\- I keep my resume brutally honest. Only things I've actually worked on end-to-end. No \"touched once\" tech.  \n\\- During HR screening, I ask upfront: what are the must-have skills vs good-to-have. That alone removes a lot of noise.  \n\\- I prepare only for the must-haves based on the JD. Deepen what's already in my muscle memory instead of trying to re-learn everything.  \n\\- I spend some time on the company's product, domain, and scale (website, LinkedIn, engineering blogs if any). It genuinely helps with context-based questions.  \n\\- With the technical panel, I'm explicit about strengths vs areas where I have working knowledge but not daily hands-on. That clarity usually builds trust rather than hurting.  \n\n\nOne hard truth I've learned: you can't \"video-course\" your way into senior interviews. At that level, they're mostly testing judgment, trade-offs, and how you've solved real problems --- not whether you remember syntax.\n\nGiven your background, this doesn't sound like a capability issue at all. It's about aligning your experience to their expectations and framing it well.\n\n\n\nHope this helps - and rooting for you to crack it this time :)   \nGood luck!!!",

You don't need to know everything. What you should be doing is showing how your experience would play a role in making critical, business-driving decisions. With 25 years of experience, that's what people will look to you for. If you are not ready for that I would suggest stripping your CV a bit to fit the role that you want.\n\n> I have an technical interview next week.

At 25 years in, interviews stop testing whether you’re competent and start testing how well you perform under artificial pressure. That’s a different skill than doing the job.\n\nA “touch everything” course usually doesn’t fix this because the issue isn’t missing knowledge, it’s recall under stress. You know this stuff, but interviews force instant answers without the normal workflows you’d use on the job like docs, notes, or quick lookups. No one actually works that way day to day.\n\nWhat tends to work better is focused refresh plus simulation. Pick the core areas you expect to be asked about and do light hands on reps so your muscle memory comes back. Then practice answering questions out loud, even if it feels awkward. Being able to calmly say “here’s how I’d approach this, here’s what I’d verify, here’s what I’d look up next” goes a long way at senior levels.\n\nOne thing that helped me personally was having a quiet safety net during technical interviews so I didn’t feel like my entire career depended on perfect recall in the moment. I’ve used StealthCoder for that, and it reduced the mental load enough to think clearly instead of freezing. It doesn’t replace experience, it just lets you actually show it.\n\nYou’re not failing because you lack skill. You’re failing because interviews are a weird performance exercise. Fixing that is very doable in a week if you focus on recall, structure, and staying calm instead of trying to relearn everything.",

Take notes of any comments from them about your correctness of answers, your confidence, your communication style and effectiveness, your preparedness, etc.  Also generally for a bigger interview if their needs include something I didn’t use before (or recently) I do a quick refresher course on YouTube or something to sharpen that skill so that I interview well.\n\nI’m someone who interviews very well but I’m also quite awkward and anti social and adhd.  But lots of practice makes me quite good at it.  I succeed at a very high percentage of my interviews, enough that I in the past have turned down jobs after some questions I answer surface troubling realities inside the companies tech stack or hierarchy or culture or something.  It’s a good place to be and it just requires practice.  I had a teacher in college which all we did all class was interview each other constantly to practice being a good interviewer and interviewee.\n\nPs: 25 years of experience as devops now since before it had the name of devops.  :)",

Our CICD pipeline is very solid and simple to maintain.  Most of my work centers around DevSecOps instead of just DevOps.  I KNOW that my company is paying me less than what I'm worth, but when the market is \"iffy\", I don't want to rock the boat.  I do well in my role, but even 6 years later I still feel like there's a bit of imposter syndrome going on, despite consistently good recognition and reviews.\n\nSo I helped out on an AI-centric hackathon with work and provided all kinds of tech-related assistance to the different teams, such as provisioning new cloud products, creating DNS records for them, debugging various issues, things like that.\n\nAfterwards, I'm now being told that for FY26, I have a personal goal of related certification to attain, but it's on me to find the relevant certs with which to get.  I know what AI is.  I can bust out a set of prompts that are rather decent.  That's about the extent of it.\n\nSo as a DevOps Engineer, who acts as a consultant for his team on the more technical side of things, I feel it's my responsibility to not only be able to deploy various models, but also interact with various closed models, as well.  And this includes Generative AI for text-based resources and image-based resources as the company I work for is one of the largest graphics-related companies in the world, apparently that's important.\n\nSo where do I start?  I feel I need to know what's involved at a low level, hence the thought about deploying models.  Beyond that, it's pretty new territory to me.",

Then layer on the operational stuff like A/B testing frameworks, drift detection, cost monitoring. The closed model APIs are actually easier since you're just managing rate limits and token usage. But once you get into self-hosted models you need to worry about inference optimization, batching strategies, all that fun stuff. AWS has some ML specialty certs that cover the deployment side pretty well, but they're very AWS-specific obviously.",

      "text": "Context:\n\nThis year, I will cross the five-year experience milestone in the IT industry. The majority of this time has been spent in a DevOps/SRE-type role, where I mainly worked on Azure Pipelines templates and Terraform (I feel quite confident in Terraform now, I've already fixed a couple of tricky deadlock situations) for our AWS infrastructure (nothing crazy, basic services like S3, EC2, Lambda, and API Gateway). I rarely coded smaller parts of .NET applications or helper applications, and I also often automated tasks using PowerShell and Bash.\n\nActual post:\n\nI haven’t received my salary update yet, but I doubt it will be anything more than a 10% raise at best, plus one additional salary as a bonus. The past six months have been really rough due to deadlines, management chaos, and the AWS migration from legacy servers.\n\nI am considering switching jobs this year, as I have been with this company for almost four years. I have a good manager (he gives me exceptional performance notes), and I have a chill remote setup, but at the same time, I can see that, theoretically, I could earn 2–2.5x my current salary at my level of experience (according to the offers I see on job boards - at least theoretically in my area, I am not US based). I know that the market is in very rough state currently, even in my country but somehow there are still job postings\n\nThe point is that I suck at interviewing. I hate doing live coding challenges, my brain always goes blank, and I forget how to even create a basic loop.\n\nI also want to upskill a bit, but I’m not sure what to focus on with all the AI hype these days. I wanted to:\n\n\\- Read Linux Bible: I want to organize my Linux knowledge. I use WSL and Bash, but I mainly work in Windows Server environments, which kind of sucks.\n\n\\- Learn material for AWS certs: In the past, I’ve bought a couple of courses on Udemy but haven’t actually completed them. I think this could help me organize my AWS knowledge better, especially for the Solutions Architect Associate and CloudOps Associate certifications, and maybe later the DevOps Engineer Professional but that depends on how much time I have. (I don’t think I’ll actually take the exams, is it still worth it?)\n\n\\- AI coding/agents as my current company is pushing it really hard\n\n\\- Monitoring: I want to expand my knowledge in this area, but so far I only have experience with CloudWatch, which is a provider-locked solution. I’d like to learn other tools, but I don’t know where to start maybe OpenTelemetry, Grafana, or Prometheus? Could you suggest anything?\n\nFinal questions/thoughts:\n\nWhat are your personal goals for 2026?\n\nHow would you approach it in my current position?\n\nI feel like imposter syndrome is bigger than ever, especially with AI agents and recent revelations about their performance. Hard to chill, to be honest, I've even started considering weekend university courses in psychology because all of this (studies in my country are free or low fee)",

Also interviewing is not fun for both sides, I'm actually more stressed when I'm interviewing someone rather than when I'm being interviewed. \n\nIf you want to get your hands dirty with Linux I will actually recommend RHCE, even without taking the certificate, the material is good.  \n  \nI also want to earn AWS certificate, I'm sadly no longer working with it, but so I'm a little rusty. Not sure if the cert its self is worth it, but the content is not really what I would expect from engineer, IMO it is more of a marketing exam. They push doing things the AWS way, which is often not the most optimal solution when taken into larger context (e.g. using Beanstalk instead of ECS/EKS, all things CloudFormation). But architect associated will definitely not be a time-waster. I'm not sure if recruiters care about it, I know that it gives you an edge in companies pursuing partnership with AWS(mostly outsourcing/MSPs)\n\nFor the monitoring stuff I suggest reading the google SRE book, it covers more important topics than the technology(like what to monitor, how to interpret,...)",

Feel like i did really well technical/infrastructure discussion until we got to the coding assessment. As i said im self taught so im sure it was just spaghetti code (though i hope ive made some improvements in the last 4-5 years). My fiance and I are thinking about moving and I want to be better prepared for interviews.\n\nIve done some research into things like leetcode, bootcamps, mentorships, etc but everything seems to be scams or mixed reviews.",

With your experience, I doubt the problem is problem solving. It’s usually structure, naming, clarity, and how you communicate your approach.\n\nA good starting point is getting comfortable with simple, boring code: small functions, clear names, consistent formatting, and straightforward control flow. “Clean Code” can help, but even more useful is practicing refactoring: take an old script you wrote, read it like a stranger, and improve it step by step.\n\nAlso avoid overengineering. If a script just does a few REST calls (e.g., 2 GETs, 1 POST, 1 DELETE), a handful of well-named functions is often better than a class hierarchy. When the script grows, you start seeing repetition, or you know it will be reused, then it’s a good moment to split it into modules and add a bit more structure.\n\nIf you can, practice doing this in a timed setting (30–60 minutes): solve something small, then spend the last 10 minutes cleaning it up, adding basic error handling, and making it easy to read. That’s often what interviewers are looking for.",

It cannot realistically be broken in such a way that you can't boot into a working system back, unlike many other distros. It has preconfigured config files and server settings and service configs for a huge amount of stuff. Adding new things straight from source is much easier than doing it in other distros. You can ditch all the docker images/containers/files you used to use for different development environments for things, because custom development environments are a breeze and can be shared with a file in git to your team.",

But in reality, it often turns into a slow, document-heavy process that doesn’t line up well with how modern cloud or DevSecOps teams realistically work.\n\nThis was in a recent *United States Cybersecurity Magazine* article (lmk if you want the link):\n\n“The ATO bottleneck isn’t just a tooling or paperwork problem. It comes from trying to apply static authorization models to highly dynamic systems, where risk ownership is fragmented and evidence is collected long after the real security decisions have already been made.”\n\nFeels pretty accurate. It’s not that security controls don’t matter, it’s that the ATO process itself hasn’t really evolved alongside CI/CD, cloud-native systems, or continuous delivery.\n\nCurious what your experience has been and if/how you see ATO potentially evolving (or devolving?) under the current administration.\n\n",

By then, their \"operational prototype\" is \"mission critical\" and can't be easily shut down.",

It encourages programs to get used to minimal oversight while still granting access to the network. \n\nTry explaining the importance of security to a new college grad or a developer sometime. It's like pulling teeth to get them to understand that security breaches are not a question of *if* but *when*. Here are some of the things I get told:\n\n\"It's all a box ticking exercise\"\n\"Nobody actually cares\"\n\"If [security] were more competent, we wouldn't have to do this\"\n\"I'm not paid to care about security\"\n\"Just get it done\"\n\"We can always fix it later.\"\n\nIn part, I blame myself - it's hard for me to articulate the threat - when bad guys come knocking, if we have vulnerabilities, they will find them, and we, not management, will pay the price. It's easy for people to call things a box ticking exercise when they don't understand the reason for that box, and that those boxes, just by implementing them, even if they are not used all the way, make us more secure and give us a better chance of recovery post breach than if we didn't. Documentation of what is and is not is never a bad thing, and the SCA-V is a great exercise in being able to bring a stranger up to speed on the environment in a short time.",

Today I stumbled upon a link (which I lost) for a new s3-backed open source apm tool and got me thinking about this.\n\nSince I'm already on the Grafana stack, I'm considering Tempo, but there are other alternatives like https://signoz.io/ https://openobserve.ai/ and Elastic APM. All three of those are pretty resource-hungry and I'd prefer something lighter with S3 storage.\n\nDo you have any suggestions for other tools to evaluate? On the app side we're mostly hosting php and python apps.\n\nHappy new years and thanks in advance for any tips!",

The resource consumption on signoz and elastic was killing us - we had a small cluster but APM was using more resources than our actual workloads.\n\nHave you looked at Jaeger with S3 backend? It's not as feature rich as tempo but way lighter. We ran it for a while before building our own. The UI is basic but functional. For python apps the opentelemetry auto-instrumentation works pretty well, php is a bit more manual but doable. One thing that helped us was just sampling aggressively - like 1% of traces unless there's an error. Cut our storage needs by 90% and still caught most issues.\n\nThe S3 backed APM you mentioned might be hyperdx? They open sourced recently i think. Haven't tried it myself but heard good things about the resource usage. Another option is just using cloudwatch traces if you're on AWS - not open source but dirt cheap if you sample right and integrates well with other AWS stuff. We actually use a hybrid now at Okahu - cloudwatch for basic traces and our custom solution for the more complex AI observability stuff we need. Sometimes the boring solution is the right one.",

And there's no better way to understand a problem than by having it yourself...as a developer...as a system administrator.\n\n>What actually helped you get your first role?\n\nThis is why most successful \"DevOps\" folks came from development or system administration, roles that often don't understand the needs of each other.  A \"DevOps\" role can help aid understanding and direct solutions that span the SDLC, helping break problems out of their silos so that more inclusive solutions can be made. -There's also the mostly mythical idea that if you just lock the (mostly introverted) devs and the (very introverted) sysadmins in a box for a while that \"DevOps culture\" will magically happen...all evidence and common sense to the contrary.\n\nFor myself I was a developer and I/we kept having issues which seemed like they should have a software solution.  No one else was interested in solving the problems (they were happy pulling tickets off the backlog), so I jumped into it.  Very quickly I had enough success smoothing out our release processes that within a few months I wasn't working on normal development projects at all, instead I was the full time \"release manager\" for all the company's projects.\n\n>When did you personally feel “ready” for a job versus just learning tools?\n\nAsk yourself questions like, \"*What are the most common pain points that the dev team is facing?*\".  Same question for the system/cloud admin?  Same question for support?  Same question for the business owners?  Same question for legal/compliance?  Same question for FinOps?\n\nIf you can't answer these for many if not most of these groups, you're probably not \"ready\" for \"DevOps\".\n\n**It's not about tools.  Tools come** ***last.***  **People > Process > Tools**\n\nGet experience doing anything else in the SDLC, be that development, admin, testing, sre, etc.  In whatever that role is always be striving to solve problems not just for your role or silo, but consider how your solutions will affect the other roles.  For example if you're a dev implementing a configuration module, how will that affect the admins who actually have to use it for deployments?  How secure would the InfoSec team consider it?  If you're storing state like sessions, what is that going to look like at scale and during scale transitions that the SRE team is going to need to consider?  When you're writing commit messages, are you using a format that will make the project manager's job easier when compiling release notes?",

My background:\n\n•  Deployed Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring 50+ nodes (reduced incident response \\~20%)\n\n•  Set up ELK/Fluent Bit + Kibana alerting with webhooks\n\n•  Built K8s clusters (kubeadm), Docker pipelines, Terraform, Jenkins CI/CD\n\n•  Basic network troubleshooting from campus IT helpdesk\n\nNow I’m trying to build a full centralized monitoring/observability system for a pharmaceutical company (traditional pharma enterprise, \\~1,500–2,000 employees, multiple factories, strong distribution network, listed on stock exchange). The scope includes:\n\n1.  Metrics collection (CPU/RAM/disk/network I/O) via Prometheus exporters\n\n2.  Full logs centralization (syslog, Windows Event Log, auth.log, app logs) with Loki/Promtail or similar\n\n3.  Network device monitoring (switches/routers/firewalls: SNMP traps, bandwidth per interface, packet loss, top talkers – Cisco/Palo Alto/etc.)\n\n4.  Database monitoring (MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server: IOPS, query time, blocking/deadlock, replication)\n\n5.  Application monitoring (.NET/Java: response time, heap/GC, threads)\n\n6.  Security/anomaly detection (failed logins, unauthorized access)\n\n7.  Real-time dashboards, alerting (threshold + trend-based, multi-channel: email/Slack/Telegram), RCA with timeline correlation\n\nI’m confident I can handle the metrics part (Prometheus + exporters) and basic logs (Loki/ELK), but the rest (SNMP/NetFlow for network, DB-specific exporters with advanced alerting, security patterns, full integration/correlation) feels overwhelming for me right now.\n\nMy question for the community:\n\n•  On a scale of Junior/Mid/Senior/Staff, what level do you think this task requires to do independently at production quality (scaleable, reliable alerting, cost-optimized, maintainable)?\n\n•  Is it realistic for a strong Junior+/early-Mid (2–3 years exp) to tackle this solo, or is it typically a Senior+ (4–7+ years) job with real production incident experience?\n\n•  What are the biggest pitfalls/trade-offs for beginners attempting this? (e.g., alert fatigue, storage costs for logs, wrong exporters)\n\n•  Recommended starting point/stack for someone like me? (e.g., begin with Prometheus + snmp\\_exporter + postgres\\_exporter + Loki, then expand)\n\nI’d love honest opinions from people who’ve built similar systems (open-source or at work). Thanks in advance – really appreciate the community’s insights",

          "text": "I would think the current scope is too big for one person. Why is there a need to jump straight into a comprehensive end-to-end observability stack? What business objectives does this solve? What are the key metrics or information that upper management wants to know about that made them want \"everything\"? Were there prior failures, errors or latency issues? Without knowing these, it is difficult to identify what kind of rules and alerts you would want to craft.\n\nThat said, if I were to attempt to scope this in a purist fashion, I would try to setup observability for systems that have the most immediate impact to the business.\n\nCreate alerts for systems that would directly impact availability and users. If you have auto-scaling, create alerts when auto-scaling fails. Create alerts when workloads cannot self-recover. Then, tackle other non-breaking problems separately in future such as point 6 on security/anomaly detection. Naively, I would think metrics are more important traces, and traces are more important than logs. Especially for logs where you can read them locally.\n\nGiven your experience, I think starting with collecting key metrics for all nodes/systems would be a quick win. Create alerts if they go down. Move on to application and database monitoring. Metrics, traces and logs will give you the full RCA with timeline correlation (giving you the full \"why\"). I think the biggest pitfall would be underestimating how difficult it is to do a comprehensive RCA with the full timeline correlation. People pay for such a solution.\n\nI continue to think this is still too big of a task for one person to complete. Or you could buy a solution like what another redditor suggested.\n\n[https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems/](https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems/)",

If this was all you ever did you could probably get it working. If you worked for me i'd recommend you trim this down to just prom + grafana for now. That's a TON to learn and gets you alerting and visibility into system performance, app metrics and network gear.  Now go back and learn loki to solve the logging \"blind spot\".\n\n- If you don't know any promQL you are gonna struggle. AI can help with this but falls over at scale in my experience.\n- Doing prom at scale has its own challenges. I've you never had to manage multiple prom instances, you're going to have to make a lot of design decisions. Things like where alerting actually occurs from, centralizing all of the metrics? Relabeling usually comes into play here. \n- The snmp_exporter is *THE WORST* one for you to start with. It is incredibly confusing compared to how most other exporters operate. It requires you to understand a lot about SNMP and MIBs (for your own sanity) and how they get loaded (which is slightly diff depending on distro).\n- Highly recommend you start with node exporter which usually runs on pretty much everything along side other exporters for $app. \n- You can do all the network stuff in prom, likely via SNMP exporter for a lot of it depending what gear you run. You want to avoid SNMP if possible but not everything has an API.  \n- SNMP traps are a no-go in prom. **HOWEVER** in my experience they can usually be re-created in promql and fire an alert instead of requiring the trap to be the \"alert\". Not always feasible but to give an example,  i recreated what used to be an SNMP trap from our UPS systems into a Prom alert to tell us when utility power died and things were running on battery.",

Some no doubt already have their own ways of monitoring and probably already consider this a solved problem with a mature solution. So it needs to be sold to upper management first. Correlation is the killer app in observability so maybe that's what you can sell by having everything in prom. \n\nHowever if you already have this part cleared then my only advice would be atleast try use gnmi for your network devices. Also work very closely with whoever is using the alerts and visualisation from day 0 else noone will use this. Use dashboards as code where you can. btw nothing you've listed is going to work with netflow, you need yet another tool.",

If your tool can map `<AWS_KEY_1>` back to the original value automatically on the return trip, that saves a lot of time/headache.\n\nRegarding the NLP detection, does it handle custom regex patterns for proprietary internal token formats?

I’m looking for **early adopters and contributors** to break it, give feedback, and help shape the architecture.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/zrougamed/orion-belt](https://github.com/zrougamed/orion-belt)\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts on the approach and how you handle privileged access in your environments!\n\n  \nIf this resonates, consider forking the repo, testing it in your setup, and sharing feedback or PRs — your input could directly shape Orion-Belt’s design and feature set!",

      "text": "Hey folks,\nSo I'm in some BS situation right now and honestly don't know if I'm being paranoid or actually getting shafted.\nStarted a contract gig ~4 months back. Client needed their ML stack unfucked - they had data scientists pushing models to prod with literally zero pipeline, no monitoring, nothing. My job was:\nSpin up proper MLOps infra on AWS (SageMaker + custom containers), Get their LLM stuff production-ready (they were running GPT wrappers with no fallbacks lmao), \nBuild out some agentic workflows for their support chatbot, Set up proper observability - Prometheus/Grafana, cost tracking, the works\nLock down their IAM because it was a dumpster fire\nRate was $18k split across 3 milestones - $6k each for planning, implementation, and deployment/handoff.\nHere's where it gets weird:\nFirst $6k hit my account fine. Second milestone, I shipped the entire ML pipeline, containerized everything, got their models deploying automatically. Invoice them, get... $2.5k. Ask WTF, they say \"we're reviewing costs quarterly now\" and me be like Ok!.\nI didn't go aggressive because tbh I had like $9k buffer saved up and my project pipeline was dry. Figured I would finish strong, they would see the value, make it right.\nFast forward - I'm basically done. Their LLM agents are handling 60% of tickets autonomously, inference costs down 40%, everything's monitored. I even wrote runbooks for their junior devs. Invoice the last $6k.\nTwo weeks of ghosting, then they schedule a call. Offer me $3.2k as \"completion bonus\" bringing total to like $11.7k.\nTheir reasoning: \"timeline extended beyond scope and we had infrastructure costs we didn't anticipate.\"\nBro. The timeline extended because THEY kept pivoting on which LLM provider to use (we went OpenAI -> Anthropic -> back to OpenAI). The infra costs went DOWN because of my work. I literally showed them the FinOps dashboards.\nI'm sitting here like...? Do I just take the L and move on? My savings are getting thin and I don't have another gig yet, so part of me is like \"just take the $3k and don't make enemies.\"\nBut another part is pissed because the work is legitimately good and in production making them money.\nWhat would you do & I should do?\nAnyone been in something similar? I had some rascals earlier who didn't paid me , Ignored my reachouts after the contract work was done , They is a special place in hell for these guyzz ..",

And in our line of work planning is 100% of the project.",
