I spent my days configuring OSs with Ansible and deploying them with Terraform using on-prem providers like vSphere and Proxmox. We hosted everything ourselves, and I really loved the feeling of actually *owning* those workloads.\n\nA few months ago, I took a new job at a company that helps migrate workloads to the Big 3 cloud providers... and I kind of hate it.\n\nI’m the type of person who likes to own my things in my personal life, and I’m realizing that applies to my professional life, too. On top of that, my current employer is heavily invested in a the well known Office suite ecosystem, which just doesn't align with my values—especially as an EU citizen paying attention to the current geopolitical climate.\n\nI know the obvious advice is *\"just switch jobs,\"* and I am actively looking. But it's tough when \"the cloud\" is practically a mandatory requirement on every job posting these days. I read this [blog post](https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-we-re-leaving-the-cloud-654b47e0) which is already 3 years old that give me hope for the future of on-prem\n\nI understand the business value of the cloud, but from a technical and ethical standpoint, my heart is still with on-prem.

Cloud isn’t going away but neither is on-prem. It’s just shifting.

You get more bang for your buck, and once you've got everything setup the maintenance is relatively predictable.\n\nBut for workloads which aren't predictable, or for new businesses where their needs aren't well understood yet the cloud can be much better. No more waiting for weeks for that new capacity or spending time finding good VARs. Just spin up what you need in 30 seconds and move on.\n\nFor truly scalable or fluctuating workloads cloud can often be cheaper as well. But these situations are rare, and often people think they have this when they don't. It also requires you to go full \"cloud native\" with things like serverless.\n\nBoth are fine honestly, and I'd hate to work with the wrong one for the situation. There are also plenty of EU based cloud options, they're not as feature full as AWS but sometimes that's a feature itself.",

IaaS is definitely a thing and aligns more with what you seem to be looking for?\n\nI honestly don't understand since you seem to be a software person rather than infra: I really don't get at all what your dig is with Cloud. Like what ethical issue do you have with data centers? If anything (ignoring the AI insanity) larger scale data centers that can be put in more sane places and consolidating servers will generally be better environmentally. Maybe job-wise there is also some consolidation as they will spread more part time employees to maintaining things, but I think that evens out when there are still admins required to run things for the business (SaaS excluded of course, but how much time did you spend \"running\" Exchange/Other mail servers). So yeah I think you just have some internal hiccup about this that you might want to just get over.\n\nI do kind of get it in one way, you've done thing in a particular way and you feel that was successful ... but being unable to transfer that success with something that in most aspects is the same as what you were doing already: is a real problem in the long run. IT landscapes change quickly and constantly, we all need to adjust and grow with it to stay relevant.",

They do different things and it's okay to enjoy one more than the other. A hybrid approach tends to be my favorite unsurprisingly.\n\nThe thing is, this is a regular cycle in systems. We had mainframes and thin clients when hardware was more expensive and interconnects were fast enough, then we got fat clients and thinner servers doing coordination. Then it shifted back and so on and so forth. Cloud is the ultimate fat server, thin client methodology as it finally breaks it down to an api-first philosophy and allows you to start considering how expensive and reasonable is it to host it yourself.\n\nIf it helps, I find heavy IaC development helps me scratch my on-prem itch a bit. It's not the same, but a broad, flexible, well-ordered infra code stack you understand how to wrangle, improve, and update gets into a lot of the same brain nooks and crannies that understanding all the hardware does. If you can, leveraging more cloud-agnostic tools or understanding how to migrate between them not only gives you more control in general but also lets you KNOW how it all works in a similar way to racking your own boxes.\n\nIn my heart, I'll always prefer building my own cloud, letting me own the whole ecosystem, but finding ways to embrace the environment you find yourself in is essential to both survival and happiness. It's okay to have a preference, and hopefully your cloud work will help you focus WHY you prefer on-prem in a way that helps you leverage it. Best of luck",

We're constantly removing dozens of posts a day, but some will slip through. This is where we need your help to report these posts. It's much easier to remove and ban those abusive users in a reported post, because reported posts get flagged for reviews.\n3. I plan on creating a mod application because we need more mods spread across different timezones. r/devops is consistently top 10 tech subs in terms of daily traffic so additional help will be needed.\n4. Whenever you see someone posting a \"discussion\" that is clearly an advertisement, report it and/or ping me/us directly.

At the same time a comment about sub-par functionality from an ACME was getting lots of upvotes. So I believe it's you misunderstanding the way how this works from the perspective of a small vendor.  \n  \nI.e. see just my recent comment - it's not even an active tool I'm working all - it's something that we're currently using internally + few clients and don't mind selling to orgs with similar problem. And it's auto-downvote just when I mention it.\n\nThe interesting part for me is that in parallel everybody is complaining why there is so much monopoly and so little innovation in the DevOps space. I wonder why ;)",

      "text": "I interviewed a person today for a DevOps role. His resume was very thick with technical things. Software he's used, frameworks, programming languages, security and compliance regulations, standards, etc. There was not much about how he worked with those things, what he did with them, which bits he was more familiar with and less familiar with.\n\nI tried to get an idea about what kind of techie he is. Did he learn these things on his own? Or is he driven more by learning things as needed for the job? Has he designed anything on his own? Is he lawful good or chaotic neutral or...? Etc.\n\nThe answers I got made it feel like most of what he's done is work where someone else directed him, he coordinated with other teams, used vendor tools with pre-determined actions, ran scripts, etc. This is okay, since this wasn't for a senior role. But it made me think about how important it is, as a job seeker, to give a potential employer an idea of what kind of work you do. It's not just about checking boxes or flexing on hard skills, but showing that you're a person as well. Especially since these days everyone's on the lookout for AI chatbot answers. In this case, maybe he was just nervous. Maybe he's not good in formal situations. Or maybe he's just \"not a good fit\", as they say.",

But asking \"tell me about a time you chose the wrong approach for something and how you figured that out\" separates people who actually owned systems from people who followed runbooks. Because nobody who genuinely operated infrastructure for a year or more hasn't broken something or picked the wrong tool. If they can't tell you about it, they probably didn't own it.\n\nThe other thing that works well for junior roles specifically: give them a problem they definitely won't know the answer to and watch what they do. Not to trick them, but to see if they ask clarifying questions, talk through their reasoning, or just freeze up. The thinking process matters way more than the answer at that level.",

Output per employee goes up. The board is happy.\n\nThen production reality starts to show up.\n\nKlarna is the clearest example. Their AI assistant handled the workload of hundreds of support agents and they reduced staff aggressively. The financial metrics improved and revenue per employee went very high.\n\nBut the customer experience dropped. Engineers had to step into support. They started bringing humans back.\n\nSo AI did not fail. The strategy failed. They used AI as a replacement instead of as leverage.\n\nYou can see the same pattern in the McDonald’s AI drive thru pilot. The issue was not that the technology exists. The issue was accuracy in a real environment with real customers. The human fallback had been removed too early.\n\nFiverr also moved to an AI first model and cut a large part of the workforce. What followed was not a pure cost saving story. It became a restructuring into new roles built around AI.\n\nNow look at the companies where the numbers are actually strong.\n\nIBM automated large parts of internal operations and then hired more engineers.\n\nSalesforce increased support capacity and moved people to higher value work.\n\nIn those cases AI increased output per person. It did not remove the need for experienced people.\n\nThis is starting to show up in DevOps and platform teams.\n\nThere is a growing belief in some organisations that AI can run infrastructure, manage incidents, write pipelines and remove the need for senior engineers.\n\nIt can help with log analysis. It can help generate Terraform. It can summarise alerts. It can produce a first version of a runbook.\n\nBut in a real incident you still need someone who understands the system, the business impact and the trade offs. You still need coordination across teams. You still need accountability.\n\nThat part has not changed.\n\nThe companies getting real value from AI are using it to remove toil and to make good engineers faster and more effective.\n\nThe companies cutting teams because they think AI replaces experience are saving money for a few quarters and then rebuilding the same capability under pressure.\n\nCurious what others are seeing.\n\nIs AI in your organisation increasing the impact of the platform team or being used as a reason to reduce it?",

GPU's ain't cheap.\n\nSo hate on the PR people saying AI is the reasons for firing, because that's a total farce.

It just doesn't have the knowledge other than some newb posting on Stack Overflow or Medium like 10 years ago.\n\nIt's broken so much stuff and they've been told to only use it for Bash, Python, AWS CLI etc and definitely not for an API for a vendor we use unless they're super huge like Google or similar.  Python is still questionable.  v2 vs v3 and it mixes things up so much unless you give it existing code to review.  \n\nRecently one of my guys completely f**ked a database because they trusted what it said about Percona Tools.  *sigh*",

Are you planning to focus on AWS, Azure, or GCP?\n\nAfter choosing one, I’d prioritize core services like compute, storage, IAM, and networking, then move into Infrastructure as Code with Terraform. Pair that with basic CI/CD and Docker so you understand how apps get deployed in the cloud. You don’t need advanced Kubernetes yet, but understanding containers is important.

I'm deeply involved in corporate security stuff, but usually it was for entertainment companies or online learning platforms. Now my friend invited me to take on a new job in a new niche (iGaming), and I agreed... =(\n\nSo now messing up with gambling product and trying to get serious about igaming fraud prevention but nothing helps. I just don't understand where to look and where to find proper solutions. Like, I've never had anything to do with this before, and the devil made me agree to go work at this place (the funniest thing is that the income isn't much more than at my old job, so yes, I'm a loser, lol).\n\nI’m trying to understand how fraud prevention software in this niche works (is it same or different, if different - whats the difference), but the internet seems completely empty. In any case, I'll most likely leave team in the near future, but kinda obliged to at least set up some kind of real-time fraud monitoring for them, otherwise it would be unprofessional and unfair on my part.\n\nIf you’ve implemented this type of solutions and it actually reduced fraud or something like that, what worked for you?\n\n(pls **no companies names** as I don't want to turn this post into one big ad!!!)",

      "text": "Hi all,\n\nI am working full-remote as DevOps which in our comapny means AllOps\n\nBackground: \nI started as an intern developer in another company 4 years ago. Worked as an intern (part-time) for a year and half on internal projects and wrote automated tests, setting up self-hosted runners for running the tests etc. - my netto was pretty modest as a part-time intern. After I graduated, I got full time offer from them as QA Automation engineer - got payed double, but still modest. I did that for about 6 months, and they offered me DevOps role. I trained for a month, then I was given tasks to manage cluster of Hetzner nodes running Docker Swarm applications, setting up CI/CD and managing small K8s cluster.\n\nAfter 6 months in that role, I was offered a DevOps Engineer role in my current company. I accepted the job mostly because of the experience I would earn, which proved to be the right decision. I was their first DevOps, and had to write Terraform for all of their resources on AWS, provision EKS for multi-environment, zero downtime, multi AZ, set up self-hosted tools, optimize their CI/CDs and all of that nice stuff. I reduced their monthly infrastructure cost for about 25%. Fast forward to today, after year and a half I am doing EVERYTHING - managing databases, handling multiple different EKS, self-hosted monitoring and logging stack, doing their FinOps (constructing reports, deciding on Savings Plans, RI etc.), managing their Google Workspace (setting up users, emails for multiple domains, MX, DKIM, etc.). Everything that is not developing the application and testing it - is somehow my responsibility. In addition to this, I am leading another DevOps Engineer who joined recently and isn't really confident about touching anything production related. \nAlso, I am often expected to be available outside my working hours when something goes down. I jump in because I take ownership in what I build but this isn't part of my contract and I feel like I shouldn't be doing this.\n\nThe salary didn't quite keep up with my workload. I got one raise of 20%. Another one of 10% and that's where I currently am.\nI gained a lot of experience and I feel confident about everything I do, but I feel like I am very underpaid (even for my location) for the amount of work I do.\n\nWhat would you do in my position? Should I start rejecting the work I am not supposed to do? Should I ask for significant salary increase or is the only way to switch the job?",

The company was not making good decisions and they didn't listen. \n\nFor example, we needed AWS WAF for SOC2 that for our containers on Aptible that turned into a hacky reverse proxy connection because that wasn't an Aptible feature at the time, not sure if that's been solved. The EC2's hosting the reverse proxy would randomly timeout when hitting the app hosted on Aptible. We had connection issues with our lambda functions hitting the Aptible DBs that were timing out sporadically. AWS would blame Aptible and vice-versa. It was a mess. The eng team used Retool and they no longer offered an option to host Retool on Aptible which led to another migrating. It was a mess",

We had good practices too but the gap showed up when we had to explain them consistently.\n\nThe biggest friction for us wasn’t technical controls, twas ownership and cadence. Who owns each risk? When is it reviewed? What triggers an update? We were doing them, just not in a way that was easy to trace back six months later.\n\nIf I could go back I’d tighten three things early.\n\nFirst of all. Make risk ownership explicit and documented.\n\nSecond of all. Define review cadence and actually calendar it.\n\nLast but not least. Centralize where those decisions live so they don’t drift across slack and email.  \n  \nWe ended up tracking risk reviews and ownership in Delve so the reasoning behind decisions didn’t get lost between audits.

Flaky tests are a close second. Nothing kills trust in CI faster than “just rerun it.” Once teams normalize that, signal quality drops fast.\n\nAlso agree on YAML fatigue. It’s powerful, but debugging indentation or subtle syntax issues at scale isn’t fun.\n\nCI/CD is supposed to reduce friction.

However, with Jenkins we had established a common pipeline design that could be largely reused across all our repositories. The basic structure of the Jenkinsfile looked very familiar everywhere, had similar stages and logic, and it just invoked a bash script that handled the Docker build internally. The script had very similar structure in all repos and it was also easily runnable locally.\n\nGithub Actions forces you to use their Docker build action. Therefore, we had to re-implement all pipelines from scratch and we lost the ability to directly reproduce the Docker builds locally. Worst of all, the pipelines are now completely different between repositories, making it more difficult to understand for everybody.\n\nWe were also using the Actions Runner Controller for self-hosting the runners on our k8s cluster. That thing was absolutely impossible to debug. The autoscaler was extremely slow to respond to demand. We frequently hit the situation where dozens of jobs were waiting to be picked up, yet the ARC was seemingly doing nothing and the k8s cluster was sitting idle with plenty of available resources to run those jobs.",

(in the repo)  \n\\- Are there any better DevOps skills to learn or is there anything that I'm lacking at the moment?\n\nSince most of the jobs I've seen heavily rely on Azure, that's why it's so heavily favored in the roadmap.\n\nThank you in advance for any input.

So depending on what you're applying to Jr vs non-jr I'm going to view your resume differently. \n\nIf you're applying for a Sr position, I more than likely won't care about your lab. You're a senior. It's like comparing the tree house you built in your backyard to standing up a building on the main street. I want to know what you've actually done in an environment where you don't have the luxury of time that you get with a home lab in a pristine environment where it's only you making changes.  That makes the assumption your lab has things we use. For example bragging about running K8s on your resume. That's great but we use ECS (not EKS or K8s) so pumping that lab up doesn't really tell me much especially when I've never ran k8s myself nor been in a position to run it. \n\nIf you are applying for a Jr position, I want to see a documented history of you doing at least sysadmin level work. Can you build out a server? Can you secure it? Can you configure apache/ngnix/iis? What have you automated in your workplace? What scripting languages do you know and what real world business situation did you fix with your script? Do you know how to interface with an API, take the results, and pass it to another API to glue two things that normally don't speak to each other? etc This stage your assists in helping me keep my questions at the level that makes sense for asking.",

It could be direct (trigger ansible, terraform, etc.) or indirect (create AWX request for higher level of abstraction and/or auditing).\n\nYou didn’t say what actions you need to take but you should be able to automate routine tasks… but be sure to think about how much authority to release. In some cases the fact that the person has access to Jira is enough since you have other controls like letting people only run three instances at a time. In other cases you may need to have the workflow go through a person for approval but you can ensure all of the information they’ll need is available.",

It's an idea on the list I might try.\n\nDevelopers start by consuming the configurable GitHub workflow I created, calling it in their repo. They integrate by adding helm charts to their repo. They make a tiny PR to the platform repo to register their runners and ECR repos (abstracted as a list they add an entry to). So it's self service. Of course I have docs/guides as well. \n\nFrom there they just make PRs in their repo. If build passes, after merge, CI automatically makes another PR to bump the image referenced in the helm chart and they merge to release to EKS. Namespaced, and everything. \n\nI standardized local dev using Tilt and when the team wants I encourage using k8s with docker desktop because then they can just reuse the same helm charts locally as in prod.\n\nI have a team of like 10 devs who rotate between different internal projects all using it. The most complaints I've gotten are people who have crappy dev laptops (*cough*windows*cough*) and have trouble running containers locally.\n\nI suppose I could work towards automating even more of this.
