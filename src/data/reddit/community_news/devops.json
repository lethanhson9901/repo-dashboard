Everything else falls out from the discussions. We don't do stand ups on the platform team. We sync up like twice a week for an hour. Everything else we do as we feel we need. We have a big quarterly retro where we dump what we all thought went well, what sucked, and come up with high level action items. These high level goals will turn into a meeting or two to flesh out details, but otherwise we adjust on the fly during syncs. If someone is feeling some pain from X, they just bring it up during sync and we talk about if it makes sense to adjust how we're doing X, or stop doing X altogether.

I can count on one hand the amount of good managers I had and it's simply a different world.\n\nGood managers will tell you what to work on, require feedback and pass that feedback over to plan, align, sync and everything required with the other teams. Their calendar will be full of meetings and they'll need very short inputs from you. They will trust what you tell them because you are paid to know and to tell when you don't know.\n\nCurrently, I work a job with a bad manager, he doesn't know what I'm working on, I go to meetings without telling him, people ask me to do things directly. Once a month he remembers his role and asks me what's up. The reason I'm still there is even if my manager is bad at managing, he is actually decent at other stuff, he just stumbled into a management role and obviously didn't refuse the money. But he kept doing what he did before and does it well. He trusts I do things right and for a reason, his boss also trusts me and backs me up. I work 9-12, 14-16 4 days a week and people trust I'm not slacking.",

But honestly, anyone who's worked with Terraform for a while knows that's just not true. The state file runs the show.  \n  \nNot long ago, I hit a snag with a team sure they’d locked down their security groups - because that’s what their HCL said. But they had a pile of old resources that never got imported into the state, so Terraform just ignored them. The plan looked fine. Meanwhile, the environment was basically wide open.  \n  \nWe keep telling juniors, “If it’s in Git, it’s real.” That’s not how Terraform works. What we should say is, “If it’s in the state file, it’s managed. If it’s not, good luck.”  \n  \nSo, does anyone else force refresh-only plans in their pipelines to catch this kind of thing? Or do you just accept that ghost resources are part of life with Terraform?",

From what I’ve seen, most teams steer clear of Kubernetes if they can - they usually go for Elastic container services or no‑code deployment options first just to avoid the maintenance faff. The client I moved onto Kubernetes had already been using SageMaker, so Kubernetes made sense as an evolution of what they already had, not as a starting point.\n\nIn the video, I’m not jumping straight into Kubernetes either - I’m suggesting it as a way to orchestrate the deployment. Could you use other tools? Absolutely, as long as they tick the boxes I mentioned in the system design",

No one cares about the true workload of MLOps, and more importantly, the underlying DevOps.

If someone is working in the water industry and doing integration we dont call it waterops.\n\nWhat are you are doing is just SWE work, nothing wrong with it really but it goes past the entire point of MLOps. \n\nMLOps is also a broad field, but for someone like me who has the title, I go all the down to how does our RDMA Networking interface with our MPI Code, what's the best scaling strategies? Whats the best auto-training and auto-feature selection strategies being automated? How does the model be robust enough to last 20 years without any human interference? How are you selecting your hardware based on your ML types? How are you selecting your storage? Is everything I am doing regarding this completely reproducible? Is everything I am doing completely auditable? \n\nLike things like model registry irk me, like someone never consulted what was actually running in production. Model registry and versioning for models would never work for someone like me, who has 15mil models running everyday. What does work is reproducible and storing what actual changes were made to the model.\n\nA lot of things you talked about in the post, could be done by devops person, there is no ML focus to what you have talked about apart from your software being a ML Product.\n\nThis isnt meant to be offensive to you, but a lot of people miss the ML part of MLOps. And IMO unless you know how to do the entire model from scratch ie be a machine learning engineer, you shouldnt pick up the title of MLOps",

      "text": "I wrapped up a tech panel for a Principal Azure Engineer role at an investment bank a couple of hours ago. This followed an interview with the hiring manager last Wednesday. We know each other from the past, i.e., I’ve interviewed for multiple roles at this firm over the last 5-6 years.\n\nThis role landed on my LinkedIn feed randomly. I commented on the post and emailed the hiring manager directly, we had a short back-and-forth, and his recruiter called me almost immediately. The process has been unusually smooth by modern standards.\n\nToday’s panel felt strong. I’m confident I cleared the bar with both the Azure SME and the hiring manager. I saw visible agreement on several answers, got verbal acknowledgment more than once and handled questions from a junior panelist with ease. I was told that I’m “first in line” (not sure if that means FIFO or first on the shortlist), however,  it seemed to be directionally positive.\n\nHere’s the problem: I was laid off a little over six months ago and I am EXHAUSTED. It's like I've been on the hamster wheels of interviews since 8/4/2025. I’ve done the prep, the loops, the panels, the follow-ups. I know I’m good enough to be gainfully employed as a DevOps engineer.\n\nIf this role doesn’t turn into an offer, I’m seriously questioning whether I want to continue in tech at all. I don’t know if I have it in me to keep doing 5–7 round interview gauntlets, only to be rejected for vague reasons like “culture fit” or not smiling enough. I’ve given my adult life to STEM / engineering / corporate IT / tech and I am exhausted from having to engage with recruiters who want someone to take managerial roles for IC level pay.\n\nI’m not bitter about rejection. I’m tired of dysfunction...hiring managers who don’t know the difference between EC2 and AWS Lambda, recruiters who can’t distinguish an AWS account from an Azure subscription and BS interview processes that ding candidates for being \"too intense\".\n\nSo I’m asking honestly: when is it time to walk away?\nFor those who’ve been at a similar crossroads...did you step back temporarily, change strategy or leave tech altogether?\n\n\nTL;DR: Six months, countless interviews, strong signals in today's tech panel. If today's tech panel doesn’t result in an offer, I’m seriously considering being done with the tech interview industrial complex.",

Pay them for their services.\n\nFar too many times I've seen good staff be let go because 'budget' or they don't fit the band, you lose far more searching for replacement, training and finding those skills in multiple other contractors or employees. New staff is good, new skills sets and fresh eyes, but some employees you don't let go over small amounts of money when they bring far more value.",

I would almost go as far to say that [social skills:technical] chops is a 70:30~ ratio when considering a candidate. Obviously the reverse isn't good either(great social skills, lots of fluff on resume, lying about projects or how much they helped in said project, etc) \n\n\nedit: also to clarify, when I say \"social skills\" I don't mean how well you can present or lead a retro. I basically mean do you come off warm/friendly? Folks wouldn't be intimated to ask you a question? You can have back and forth feedback/discussion on ideas, problems & solutions without being flustered etc. I suck at presentations and avoid them when I can lol...\n\nThat's the only thing that comes to mind when someone says they get a lot of interviews, make it to the technical/final round but haven't landed anything.

Projects were on hold, people were afraid, and there was a lot of hesitation. Cancelled my lease, moved in with parents, and spent a lot of time trying to pivot into global markets (a lot of SEO, outreach.. BS, boxed wine) but it wasn't very fruitful.\n\nI ended up getting back into traditional employment, but if I had to do it again I would double down on local gig economies and traditional marketing. It felt like I was giving back to my community, making a difference, and seeing the product from start to finish.

      "text": "So I'm a freelance developer and have been doing this now for 4-5 years, with half of my responsibilites typically in infra work. I've done all sorts of public/private sector stuff for small startups to large multinationals. In infra, I administer and operate anything from the single VPC AWS machine + RDS to on-site HPC clusters. I also operate some Kubernetes clusters for clients, although I'd say my biggest blindspot is yet org scale platform engineering and large public facing services with dynamic scaling, so take the following with a grain of salt.\n\nNow that I'm doing this for a while, I gained some intuition about the things that are more important than others. Earlier, I was super interested in best possible uptimes, stability, scalability. These things obviously require many architectural considerations and resources to guarantee success. \n\nNow that I'm running some stuff for a while, my impression is that many of the services just don't have actual requirements towards uptime, stability and performance that would warrant the engineering effort and cost. \n\nIn my quest to simplify some of the setups I run, I found what probably the old schoolers knew all along. Systemd+Journald is the GOAT (even for containerized workloads). I can go some more into detail on why I think this, but I assume this might not be news to many. Why is it though, that in this subreddit, nobody seems to talk about it? There are only a dozen or so threads mentioning it throughout recent years. Is it just a trend thing, or are there things that make you really dislike it that I might not be aware off?",

And now, suddenly, it's easier to throw everything into Kubernetes. Running things as systemd units loses a lot of its luster when you already have a kubernetes cluster laying around. And then it's easier to monitor those things in kubernetes if you use the Prometheus metrics stack because you automatically get metrics endpoint monitoring via the Prometheus ServiceMonitor CRD. And then it's easier to collect logs out of your applications because you likely already have something like Alloy/Vector/Promtail shipping kubernetes logs to a centralized logging database. And then it's easier to set up networking/DNS records because you likely already have an Ingress Controller to make your workloads reachable to the outside world, External-DNS to create your DNS records, and then instead of setting up certbot as yet another systemd unit to generate your TLS certificates you have something like cert-manager already in the cluster that will do it for you. And then instead of using something like monit to toggle your systemd units when they fail (as yet another systemd unit), you just have kubernetes doing that with its builtin container restarting behavior.\n\nI hear people call it resume driven systems admin, when it's really just kind of not true. It's ignoring how much Kubernetes ecosystem tooling does for you, that you aren't quantifying when you just say \"this could be a systemd unit.\" More like \"this could be a whole collection of systemd units, terraform, Ansible, and templated out service config files.... or just one Dockerfile and Helm values file.\" There just is no such thing as a good faith discussion about Kubernetes that starts off with \"this could just be a systemd unit\" because at that point you've already told a lie.",

I'm not burnt out at the moment, but I wonder as I sit here and let Claude write an entire Python script to make some quick backend changes to a couple dozen Github repos (that management requested this morning but apparently needed two weeks ago), what's next? The story seems to be the same everywhere I go: A) join promising startup, do interesting work for a few years, C-suite cycles out, company either crashes, spins it's wheels for another few years, or we get acquired, or B) come close to jumping off a bridge studying for big tech roles, only to get to the final round to be told, \"hey, we were just kidding about full remote the three times you asked us, we need you in [insert city 1000 miles away here with a 2.5x CoL]\". If the market was better I'd start pivoting towards full on software engineering, but alas, many of our glorious technological leaders decided it was a good idea to cozy up to whatever governmental facade of the time would give them quick quarterly wins and over-gorged shareholders, so here we are.\n\nFor those of you older DevOps folk that successfully escaped and made career transitions without taking huge hits to your comp, what are you doing these days? Are you happy (or at least content)? Do you have regrats? \n\nA quick search seems like a lot of the threads asking these questions as of late are from AI doomers (which you know, understandable, I get it and hate it... but damn does it make reading Terraform docs so much easier) and folks unknowingly knee deep in a burn-out cycle; I want to hear from people that took the plunge and are happy with it, or at the very least, content not being in Cloud Infrastructure.",

Consulting org... Tried this, took 40% cut for 'brand' that didn't help. Unless it's a name like Accenture, you're better solo. Advise.... have to give some. Don't quit your job. Take 1 small project on weekends (10-15h/week). Price it at 1.5x your hourly rate. If you land 2 consistent clients, then make the jump. Biggest surprise for me are not technical skills. It's learning to scope work and say 'no' to bad-fit clients. I probably turned down 30% of inquiries last year.

The isc2 ccsp is worth picking up and pickup some cloud service provider certs from ms/aws - these would all compliment the devsecops space.  At that point i am sure you would find yourself being a real bridge between swe and csec/infosec teams and could probably move into the appsec space.  From there look at going for the cissp which is an absolute monster to slay ( well worth it though).  Then maybe add something ln the risk management space like maybe the crisc or one of the isaca certs.\n\nOnce you do make the move you will still find yourself drawing on your swe/devsecops experiences.\n\nJust remember what most ppl and textbooks miss thr point on.  Csec is about protecting people.  One of the ways we protect them is by protecting their data - but there are many other dimensions which aren't just about protecting data.  You will find people in the OT space who will really get this because,  well lets just say fail fast and fail early and having defective sodtware sure as f*ck doesn't fly when you have say a ventillator doing your breathing for you.\n\nThe cissp exam is a really interesting experience.  Because the subject matter is so broad,  its an adaptive test so if you get a question wrong it will start asking more questions on that area to shake you down.  \n\nHope this helps",

One went into consulting for small companies that can't afford a full DevOps hire, works maybe 25 hours a week and makes roughly the same.

The original architects are gone and now the push is on for major cost reduction. The only realistic path to meaningful savings (30-50%+) is a full re architect: right-sizing, VPC endpoints everywhere, single AZ where it makes sense, proper lifecycle policies, workload isolation, maybe even shifting compute patterns to Graviton/Fargate/Spot/etc.\n\nBut I’m dead set against taking that on myself rn  \n  \nThis is live production…… one mistake and everything will be down for FFS  \n  \nI don’t have the full historical context or design rationale for half the decisions.\n\n* No test/staging parity, no shadow traffic, limited rollback windows.\n* If I start ripping and replacing while running ops, the blast radius is huge and I’ll be the one on the incident bridge when it goes sideways.\n\nI’m basically stuck: there’s strong pressure for big cost wins but no funding for a proper redesign effort, no architects/consultants brought in and no acceptance that “small tactical optimizations won’t move the needle enough”.

Easy enough, in fact, may as well just migrate it back to on-prem.\n\nSmaller orgs, it's not happening that way. The initial capex of building a data center is just too much $$$.

The contradiction dissolves once you realize we're not choosing between \"all cloud\" or \"all on-prem\" anymore—we're building hybrid stacks out of necessity. K8s actually makes that mess manageable, which is probably why adoption keeps climbing even as repatriation does.\n\n  \nThe $600B capex bet is wild though. Hyperscalers are banking on AI inference costs dropping dramatically once they hit scale, but they're currently losing money on every workload. That only works if they either (a) crush operating costs through automation, or (b) charge enough to make margin when their utilization finally maxes out. Neither is guaranteed.\n\n  \nWhat actually kills me is watching teams self-host inference on cheaper hardware and getting better latency + cost than cloud pricing. That trend alone might explain the repatriation spike better than any compliance story.",

Pipe everything (APM spans, audit logs, WAF events, CloudTrail) into the same store and correlate on trace ID + timestamp windows. When a security alert fires, pull the 5-minute window around it and suddenly you see the full picture - what was deploying, what endpoints were hot, whether latency was already degraded.\n\nThe expensive-but-works answer is Datadog Security Monitoring + APM (or Elastic SIEM + APM). They handle correlation natively. Budget version is Grafana + Loki + Falco - works great but you build the glue yourself.\n\nBiggest lesson: do not try to build one unified dashboard.

Not just any layout - this one had a main control unit powered with 2 processors and 4 gigs of memory. Tied to it were two smaller helpers, each carrying 1 processor plus 4 gigs of RAM. Instead of manual updates, Argo CD now handles rolling out apps wherever needed in the system. Monitoring runs through Grafana, which pulls data via Node Exporter, showing everything on a live screen.\n\nA fixed IP now links to the host, set through DHCP so it stays the same even when power cycles happen, making remote logins smooth. Skipping Ubuntu's desktop (GNOME) layer freed up roughly 1.5 gigs of memory, leaving extra room for cluster tasks.\n\nMy question: **Would this be considered resume‑worthy for a DevOps/Cloud/Infra role?**   \nIf yes, how should I frame it — as a homelab project, a personal project, or something else?\n\nAny advice on how recruiters view homelab projects like this would be super helpful!\n\nThanks in advance ",

          "text": "If you take the homelab far enough, the payoff goes way beyond \"cool gear\": it builds real intuition for how cloud services actually work under the hood. A lot of DevOps careers are spent composing managed building blocks, so people can end up trusting the abstractions without ever building (or debugging) high availability from first principles.\n\n\nIn a homelab you inevitably run into the sharp edges that managed services hide: failure domains, quorum behavior, storage latency, networking quirks, upgrades, backups, and recovery. Working through those problems is where the learning happens, and it tends to make you both more effective in the cloud and more appreciative of what you’re paying for.\n\n\nOne nuance, though: \"homelab\" sometimes gets dismissed in interviews as a hobby or “toy project.” It can help to frame it in concrete, production-like terms - what was designed for redundancy, what failure scenarios were tested, how monitoring/alerting was set up, how upgrades and rollbacks were handled, what the backup/DR story looked like - rather than relying on the word \"homelab\" to carry the meaning.\n\n\nAnd if the setup includes something like Ceph/Rook, even at small scale, that can expose you to operational realities many DevOps engineers never touch. A strong DevOps lead will usually recognize that kind of hands-on experience as a signal that you understand systems - not just how to click together cloud resources.",

      "text": "I work at a mid-sized AEC firm (\\~150 employees) doing automation and computational design. I'm not a formally trained software developer - I started in a more traditional domain expertise role and gradually moved into writing C# tools, add-ins, and automation scripts. There's one other person doing similar work, but we're largely self-taught.\n\nOur file infrastructure runs on a Linux Samba server with 100TB+ of data stored serving all 150 + maybe 50 more users. The development workflow that existed when I started was to work directly on the network drives. The other automation developer has always done this with smaller projects for years and it seemed to work fine.\n\n**What Happened**\n\nI started working on a project to consolidate scattered scripts and small plugins into a single, cohesive add-in. This meant creating a larger Visual Studio solution with 30+ projects - basically migrating from \"loose scripts on the network\" to \"proper solution architecture on the network.\"\n\nOver 7-8 days, the file server experienced complete outages lasting 30-40 minutes daily. Users couldn't access files, work stopped, and IT had to investigate. IT traced the problem to my user account holding approximately **120 simultaneous file handles** \\- significantly more than any other user (about 30).\n\nThe IT persons sent an email to my manager and his boss saying that it should be investigated what I'm doing and why I could be locking so many files basically framing it as if I am the main cause of the outages. The other cause they have stated is that the latest version of the main software used in the AEC field (Autodesk Revit) is designed to create many small files locked by each individual user which even though true, to me sounds like a ridiculous statement as a cause for the server to crash.\n\nShould a production file server serving 200 users be brought down by one user's 120 file handles? I've already moved to local development - that's not the question. I want to understand whether I did something genuinely problematic or the server couldn't handle normal development workload. Even if my workflow was suboptimal, should it be possible for one developer opening Visual Studio to bring down the entire file server for half an hour? This feels like a capacity planning issue.\n\nHere's how they announced their discovery of the cause of the crashes to management with the email they sent:\n\n>After analyzing the logs, it was determined that one specific user (UID ...) was causing repeated server crashes.\n\n>Here is what the data shows for today between 16:34 and 17:04:\n\n>Time  \nNumber of Locks  \nAction  \n16:36  \n117  \nTerminated  \n16:38  \n116  \nTerminated  \n16:40  \n119  \nTerminated  \n16:42  \n114  \nTerminated  \n16:44  \n113  \nTerminated  \n16:46  \n112  \nTerminated  \n16:48  \n111  \nTerminated  \n16:50  \n115  \nTerminated  \n16:52  \n110  \nTerminated  \n16:54  \n108  \nTerminated  \n16:56  \n111  \nTerminated  \n16:58  \n137  \nTerminated  \n17:00  \n110  \nTerminated  \n17:02  \n108  \nTerminated  \n17:04 hours  \n108  \nTerminated  \n15 times in 30 minutes the system has terminated this user's session, but every time he reconnects and creates over 100 locks.\n\n>A normal user creates 5-20 locks. This user creates 100-140 locks on the same folder, which:\n\n>Blocks access for the remaining \\~200 users  \nOverwhelms file management system  \nRequires manual restart of Samba to recover  \nPlease identify the activity of this user:\n\n>What software does he use besides standard Revit?  \nDoes he run his own scripts or plugins?  \nDo you work with Dynamo Player or other automation tools?  \nDoes he have many projects open at the same time?  \nWorkaround: If you cannot contact the user immediately, I can temporarily block his access to the server. This will prevent him from working, but will protect other users.  \nPlease confirm whether I should proceed with a temporary block.",

The server was already at its limits and your workflow just happened to be the straw that broke it. The real question IT should be asking is why their file server has no connection limits, no resource quotas per user, and apparently no monitoring that would have caught it before a 30-40 minute outage. A properly configured Samba instance handles thousands of concurrent handles without breaking a sweat. You were right to move to local dev, but don't let them frame this as your fault.

When your prod deploy fails at 2am because some upstream Helm repo is having an outage, you'll wish you had vendored. With ArgoCD specifically, you can use a Helm chart repository as a source but pin to exact versions. The middle ground that works well: keep your Chart.yaml with dependencies pointing to upstream repos, but commit the charts/ directory (the output of helm dependency build). That way you have the full source vendored for reliability, but the Chart.yaml still documents where it came from and what version you're on. Run helm dependency update in CI periodically to check for new versions. For the security angle, Renovate or Dependabot can watch your Chart.yaml and open PRs when new chart versions drop, so you get visibility into updates without manually checking.",

Most of these software caches can do pull-through for new dependencies making it a no-touch operation.\n\n- Artifacts produced during a build should also be stored somewhere.

Vendoring full charts is a maintenance trap — you end up with massive diffs on every upstream update that nobody actually reviews.\n\nThe unavailable-repository fear is real though. Two approaches depending on scale:\n\n**Small team**: Just keep a `Chart.lock` with version + SHA. If the upstream disappears, you have the exact version to hunt down or reconstruct. Most major charts (prometheus, ingress-nginx, grafana) are on multiple mirrors.\n\n**Larger org**: Run a ChartMuseum or Harbor instance as a pull-through cache. Every chart you reference gets cached automatically. Nexus works too if you already have it for other artifact types. This also gives you an audit trail of which chart versions ever entered your cluster.\n\nWith ArgoCD specifically, the source hydrator feature someone mentioned is great for this — it renders to static manifests at sync time, so even if the chart repo is gone, your last-synced state is preserved as plain YAML in git. Best of both worlds: you get the ergonomics of Helm templating with the auditability of committed manifests.",

Help prevent issues that could impact production or software delivery from being  merged\n2. Enforce a consistent style so you don’t waste time arguing about whitespace etc with colleagues\n\n\nI would take a critical look at the failures you experience. Do the checks help achieve either one of those goals? If not, consider adjusting the settings. Some rules I just find to be pedantic and not helpful, so bring this up with your team and tweak it. \n\nSome checks, like autoformatters, I have run automatically as a pre-commit hook. That approach only works if the tool is very fast though (I use ruff which can lint and format my entire python repo in 2 seconds). This has helped me with the annoying feedback loop of committing, waiting 5 minutes, everything is green except the formatter, then needing to wait for everything again. \n\nYou mentioned having Snyk as a CI check, which stood out to me. Does this only check new dependencies you added in that PR, or check for vulnerabilities in existing packages? I could imagine a frustrating situation where some CVE comes out on an existing package, and then you can’t merge an emergency fix for a prod issue because you now need to also update the dependencies.\n\nPersonally I prefer using Snyk asynchronously. I set up a GitHub Actions cron to run “Snyk monitor” on the repo every night at 2am. We get weekly emails from Snyk with updates about any new vulnerabilities.",

I needed a single script that was smart enough to detect the architecture and set paths correctly (`/usr/local` vs `/opt/homebrew`) without breaking things.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* **Auto-Architecture Detection:** Automatically adjusts for Intel (x86) or Apple Silicon (ARM) so you don't have to fiddle with paths.\n* **Idempotent:** You can run it multiple times to update your tools without duplicating configs or breaking existing setups.\n* **Modular Flags:**\n   * `--minimal`: Just the essentials (Git, Zsh, Homebrew).\n   * `--skip-databases`: Prevents installing heavy background services like Postgres/MySQL if you prefer using Docker for that (saves RAM on older machines!).\n   * `--skip-cloud`: Skips AWS/GCP/Azure CLIs if you don't need them.\n* **DevOps Ready:** Includes Terraform, Kubernetes tools (kubectl, k9s), Docker, and Ansible out of the box.\n\n**What it installs (by default):**\n\n* **Core:** Homebrew, Git, Zsh (with Oh My Zsh & plugins).\n* **Languages:** Node.js (via nvm), Python, Go, Rust.\n* **Modern CLI Tools:** `bat`, `ripgrep`, `fzf`, `jq`, `htop`.\n* **Apps:** VS Code, iTerm2, Docker, Postman.\n\n**How to use it:** You can clone the repo and inspect the code (always recommended!), or run the one-liner in the README.\n\nBash\n\n    git clone https://github.com/itxDeeni/mac-dev-setup.git\n    cd mac-dev-setup\n    ./setup.sh\n    \n\nI’m looking for feedback or pull requests if anyone has specific tools they think should be added to the core list.\n\nHope this saves someone a few hours of setup time!\n\nCheers,\n\nitzdeeni",
