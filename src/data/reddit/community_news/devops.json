Exactly the skills that matter when something breaks at 2am.\n\nSome places are doing this. Incident simulation, pairing on a real (sanitized) ticket, reviewing a messy Terraform PR. The signal-to-noise ratio is just so much better than algorithmic puzzles that have zero transfer to the actual job.",

I spent my days configuring OSs with Ansible and deploying them with Terraform using on-prem providers like vSphere and Proxmox. We hosted everything ourselves, and I really loved the feeling of actually *owning* those workloads.\n\nA few months ago, I took a new job at a company that helps migrate workloads to the Big 3 cloud providers... and I kind of hate it.\n\nI’m the type of person who likes to own my things in my personal life, and I’m realizing that applies to my professional life, too. On top of that, my current employer is heavily invested in a the well known Office suite ecosystem, which just doesn't align with my values—especially as an EU citizen paying attention to the current geopolitical climate.\n\nI know the obvious advice is *\"just switch jobs,\"* and I am actively looking. But it's tough when \"the cloud\" is practically a mandatory requirement on every job posting these days. I read this [blog post](https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-we-re-leaving-the-cloud-654b47e0) which is already 3 years old that give me hope for the future of on-prem\n\nI understand the business value of the cloud, but from a technical and ethical standpoint, my heart is still with on-prem.

Cloud isn’t going away but neither is on-prem. It’s just shifting.

You get more bang for your buck, and once you've got everything setup the maintenance is relatively predictable.\n\nBut for workloads which aren't predictable, or for new businesses where their needs aren't well understood yet the cloud can be much better. No more waiting for weeks for that new capacity or spending time finding good VARs. Just spin up what you need in 30 seconds and move on.\n\nFor truly scalable or fluctuating workloads cloud can often be cheaper as well. But these situations are rare, and often people think they have this when they don't. It also requires you to go full \"cloud native\" with things like serverless.\n\nBoth are fine honestly, and I'd hate to work with the wrong one for the situation. There are also plenty of EU based cloud options, they're not as feature full as AWS but sometimes that's a feature itself.",

IaaS is definitely a thing and aligns more with what you seem to be looking for?\n\nI honestly don't understand since you seem to be a software person rather than infra: I really don't get at all what your dig is with Cloud. Like what ethical issue do you have with data centers? If anything (ignoring the AI insanity) larger scale data centers that can be put in more sane places and consolidating servers will generally be better environmentally. Maybe job-wise there is also some consolidation as they will spread more part time employees to maintaining things, but I think that evens out when there are still admins required to run things for the business (SaaS excluded of course, but how much time did you spend \"running\" Exchange/Other mail servers). So yeah I think you just have some internal hiccup about this that you might want to just get over.\n\nI do kind of get it in one way, you've done thing in a particular way and you feel that was successful ... but being unable to transfer that success with something that in most aspects is the same as what you were doing already: is a real problem in the long run.

We had mainframes and thin clients when hardware was more expensive and interconnects were fast enough, then we got fat clients and thinner servers doing coordination. Then it shifted back and so on and so forth. Cloud is the ultimate fat server, thin client methodology as it finally breaks it down to an api-first philosophy and allows you to start considering how expensive and reasonable is it to host it yourself.\n\nIf it helps, I find heavy IaC development helps me scratch my on-prem itch a bit. It's not the same, but a broad, flexible, well-ordered infra code stack you understand how to wrangle, improve, and update gets into a lot of the same brain nooks and crannies that understanding all the hardware does. If you can, leveraging more cloud-agnostic tools or understanding how to migrate between them not only gives you more control in general but also lets you KNOW how it all works in a similar way to racking your own boxes.\n\nIn my heart, I'll always prefer building my own cloud, letting me own the whole ecosystem, but finding ways to embrace the environment you find yourself in is essential to both survival and happiness. It's okay to have a preference, and hopefully your cloud work will help you focus WHY you prefer on-prem in a way that helps you leverage it. Best of luck",

I need to work on my communication skills, especially how to clearly explain the concept and drive the conversation. The god thing is that there were using fireflies service which records entire interview and provide feedback with full conversation, immediately after i got rejection mail.\n\n**Reason for Rejection:**  \nThey want someone who can speak fluent English.\n\n**CI/CD & Version Control**\n\n* Which software do you use as a reverse proxy?\n* How would you rate yourself in GitLab CI/CD out of 10?\n* What are artefacts in GitLab CI/CD?\n* You mentioned GitLab CI/CD and GitHub Actions in your resume:\n* What is the key difference between GitLab CI/CD and GitHub Actions?\n* What is the difference between Git, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI/CD?\n\n**AWS, Hosting & Deployment**\n\n* Have you hosted or deployed any Node.js projects on AWS (EC2 or other AWS services)?\n* Scenario question: Suppose there is one backend Node.js service running in Docker on an EC2 instance.\n* How would you set up an SSL certificate for it?\n* How would you generate the SSL configuration file?\n* Explain the SSL concept and why SSL is required.\n* Have you set up any AWS database services like RDS or Aurora?\n* Migration experience: You mentioned migrating Bitbucket projects to an on-prem GitLab server:\n* What migration strategy did you follow?\n* How did you plan and execute the migration?\n* Have you worked with database migrations using CI/CD pipelines (automated DB migrations)?\n\n**Docker & Containers**\n\n* Write a Dockerfile for a Node.js application using:\n* NPM as the package manager\n* Port 3000\n* What is the difference between ENTRYPOINT and CMD in Docker?\n\n**Frontend, Serverless & CDN**\n\n* Which frontend technologies have you hosted on Firebase?\n* React only?\n* Next.js as well?\n* Have you deployed any applications using AWS Lambda?\n* AWS Lambda limitation question: Lambda has a package size limit. If node\\_modules exceeds the limit, how would you solve it?\n* Difference between EC2 and serverless services like AWS Lambda.\n* What is cold start in AWS Lambda?\n* How does a CDN work?\n* Can only images and videos be cached in a CDN, or can other content be cached too?\n* What are edge servers in a CDN?\n\nEDIT: used chatgpt to format questoins topic wise and to currect english words",

Output per employee goes up. The board is happy.\n\nThen production reality starts to show up.\n\nKlarna is the clearest example. Their AI assistant handled the workload of hundreds of support agents and they reduced staff aggressively. The financial metrics improved and revenue per employee went very high.\n\nBut the customer experience dropped. Engineers had to step into support. They started bringing humans back.\n\nSo AI did not fail. The strategy failed. They used AI as a replacement instead of as leverage.\n\nYou can see the same pattern in the McDonald’s AI drive thru pilot. The issue was not that the technology exists. The issue was accuracy in a real environment with real customers. The human fallback had been removed too early.\n\nFiverr also moved to an AI first model and cut a large part of the workforce. What followed was not a pure cost saving story. It became a restructuring into new roles built around AI.\n\nNow look at the companies where the numbers are actually strong.\n\nIBM automated large parts of internal operations and then hired more engineers.\n\nSalesforce increased support capacity and moved people to higher value work.\n\nIn those cases AI increased output per person. It did not remove the need for experienced people.\n\nThis is starting to show up in DevOps and platform teams.\n\nThere is a growing belief in some organisations that AI can run infrastructure, manage incidents, write pipelines and remove the need for senior engineers.\n\nIt can help with log analysis. It can help generate Terraform. It can summarise alerts. It can produce a first version of a runbook.\n\nBut in a real incident you still need someone who understands the system, the business impact and the trade offs. You still need coordination across teams. You still need accountability.\n\nThat part has not changed.\n\nThe companies getting real value from AI are using it to remove toil and to make good engineers faster and more effective.\n\nThe companies cutting teams because they think AI replaces experience are saving money for a few quarters and then rebuilding the same capability under pressure.\n\nCurious what others are seeing.\n\nIs AI in your organisation increasing the impact of the platform team or being used as a reason to reduce it?",

I have this policy that auditors check to make sure I am adhering to which includes obtaining a director or VP of engineering approval before deploying to higher environments. Our release cycle is aggressive and I’m deploying to one of our higher envs every week on a schedule, and then there’s the need for a hotfix every once in a while. I’ve been at this job for 3.8 years, and have been working as a release engineer, Devops, SRE, or Release Manager for 26 years - so the process of obtaining approvals and adding screenshots or a copy of the approval email into the ticket is not new to me. \n\nI just don’t get it why this VP acts like it is my own personal policy every time I ask for his approval. He says the most ridiculous things at times:\n\n“Why do we even have that policy?”\n\n“Approval was granted when I asked my boss earlier in the break room - just deploy it already, why are you still waiting”\n\nthe most common response is … nothing for 12 hours til I page him in the middle of the night from the zoom call.\n\nOr today “do you want an email? I can have someone in my team send you an email and tell\n\nYou that I received the approval verbally outside of the office this morning..”\n\nI don’t get it. Every Single Time I send him the link to the internal document that clearly defines the process, and I ask him if the policy has changed. He then acts surprised.. I say it is an ‘act’ because there is no way he is forgetting that we just went over this for the 300th time a few days ago.\n\nIt makes me angrier and angrier that he is constantly trying to bypass the policies.. when I leave this job under my own accord, it will likely be because of this stupid and constant interaction with this guy.",

Get the approval workflow into your CI/CD pipeline directly. GitHub/GitLab merge approvals, or even a simple Slack bot that logs VP sign-off with a timestamp. If the approval is just clicking a button in a tool he already uses, the friction drops to near zero and you get an audit trail automatically.\n\n2. Escalate the pattern to your direct manager or the compliance team — not as a complaint about the VP, but as a process gap. Frame it as \"we have a control that's hard to enforce consistently, here's how we can automate it.\" That way you're solving a problem, not pointing fingers.\n\nAfter 26 years you already know this, but document every instance where he pushes back.

It’s a wide spectrum of concepts, technologies and more. It’s a methodology and a philosophy more than anything and any given day depending on the company you could be doing dozens of different things. If that sounds like it’s your ball game then it would before, but not every day is glamorous. Some days you’re doing cutting edge, other days you’re managing a 30 year old server some random exec needs data from for some reason that’s got no documentation or whatever.

I've had to add manual clean up steps to my jobs for things that were automatically removed by GitLab.\n\n* Neither way's necessarily better, inherently, but GitHub's opt-in approach to doing a repo checkout took some getting used to. (GitLab CI is opt-out.)\n\n* The job output display has a size cap; if you generate enough output, it gets cut off. (GitLab has a display limit too, but provides a way to get the whole output. If GitHub has that, I haven't found it.)\n\n* GitHub Actions, by virtue of GitHub not having a hierarchical group system, can't scope variables and secrets to be shared between projects without having to managed them at an Org level.\n\n* GitHub Actions can't dynamically generate pipeline job definitions by fetching external YAML from a URL at runtime.\n\n* No way to make a job step block until you click a button, unless you use Environments (and those are Approvals and spam people with notifications).\n\n* When viewing a failed job, GitHub will helpfully expand the section and scroll down to it. There's some paralax-scroll nested viewport stuff there; the link to go back to the list of runs for a workflow -- usually the link I use the most from there -- gets hidden.\n\n* You have to use a marketplace action to pass artifacts between workflows, and last I'd looked into it, that action didn't obey environment variables for using an HTTP proxy server.\n\n* There's no automatic ephemeral access token to do a checkout from another non-public repo within your org; you have to generate a PAT and store it somewhere.\n\n* GitHub UI isn't as speedy, and GitHub overall has frequent service outages.",

Either in the same repo, or in a central repo.  You put them in the same .github folder and use on: workflow_call.  Then define whatever inputs you need, which are passed from the calling job.",

The basic structure of the Jenkinsfile looked very familiar everywhere, had similar stages and logic, and it just invoked a bash script that handled the Docker build internally. The script had very similar structure in all repos and it was also easily runnable locally.\n\nGithub Actions forces you to use their Docker build action. Therefore, we had to re-implement all pipelines from scratch and we lost the ability to directly reproduce the Docker builds locally. Worst of all, the pipelines are now completely different between repositories, making it more difficult to understand for everybody.\n\nWe were also using the Actions Runner Controller for self-hosting the runners on our k8s cluster. That thing was absolutely impossible to debug. The autoscaler was extremely slow to respond to demand. We frequently hit the situation where dozens of jobs were waiting to be picked up, yet the ARC was seemingly doing nothing and the k8s cluster was sitting idle with plenty of available resources to run those jobs.",

      "text": "Hi all,\n\nI am working full-remote as DevOps which in our comapny means AllOps\n\nBackground: \nI started as an intern developer in another company 4 years ago. Worked as an intern (part-time) for a year and half on internal projects and wrote automated tests, setting up self-hosted runners for running the tests etc. - my netto was pretty modest as a part-time intern. After I graduated, I got full time offer from them as QA Automation engineer - got payed double, but still modest. I did that for about 6 months, and they offered me DevOps role. I trained for a month, then I was given tasks to manage cluster of Hetzner nodes running Docker Swarm applications, setting up CI/CD and managing small K8s cluster.\n\nAfter 6 months in that role, I was offered a DevOps Engineer role in my current company. I accepted the job mostly because of the experience I would earn, which proved to be the right decision. I was their first DevOps, and had to write Terraform for all of their resources on AWS, provision EKS for multi-environment, zero downtime, multi AZ, set up self-hosted tools, optimize their CI/CDs and all of that nice stuff. I reduced their monthly infrastructure cost for about 25%. Fast forward to today, after year and a half I am doing EVERYTHING - managing databases, handling multiple different EKS, self-hosted monitoring and logging stack, doing their FinOps (constructing reports, deciding on Savings Plans, RI etc.), managing their Google Workspace (setting up users, emails for multiple domains, MX, DKIM, etc.). Everything that is not developing the application and testing it - is somehow my responsibility. In addition to this, I am leading another DevOps Engineer who joined recently and isn't really confident about touching anything production related. \nAlso, I am often expected to be available outside my working hours when something goes down. I jump in because I take ownership in what I build but this isn't part of my contract and I feel like I shouldn't be doing this.\n\nThe salary didn't quite keep up with my workload. I got one raise of 20%. Another one of 10% and that's where I currently am.\nI gained a lot of experience and I feel confident about everything I do, but I feel like I am very underpaid (even for my location) for the amount of work I do.\n\nWhat would you do in my position? Should I start rejecting the work I am not supposed to do? Should I ask for significant salary increase or is the only way to switch the job?",

High CPU usage, low disk space warnings, temporary service restarts, minor issues that resolve themselves. Most of them don’t require action, but they still demand attention. You can’t just ignore alerts, because somewhere in that noise is the one that actually matters. Yesterday proved that point, a server issue started as a minor performance degradation and slowly escalated. It technically triggered alerts, but they were buried under dozens of other low-priority notifications. By the time it became obvious there was a real problem, users were already impacted and the client was frustrated.

The symptom is what actually matters. CPU can spike to 90% during a deploy and resolve itself in 2 minutes — that's not worth waking someone up for.\n\nPractically this means:\n\n- Alert on error rates, latency percentiles (p99), and availability — things users actually feel\n- Use \"for\" clauses aggressively (Prometheus) or sustained duration checks. If CPU > 90% for 15 minutes, that's different from a 30-second spike\n- Correlate alerts. If 6 alerts fire within 2 minutes, that's probably one incident, not six. Most monitoring tools can group these but nobody sets it up\n\nThe other pattern that kills teams: alerting on the same thing at multiple layers. Your app alerts on slow DB queries, your infra alerts on high DB connections, your DB alerts on lock contention — it's all the same incident generating 3 separate pages.\n\nWe went from ~40 alerts/day to about 5 by ruthlessly deleting anything that wasn't directly tied to user impact or data loss risk.

We did an audit and found like 70% of our alerts had never led to a real action being taken, they were just noise that people acknowledged and moved on from. Killed all of those immediately.\n\nThe other thing that made a huge difference was correlating alerts instead of treating them individually. A disk filling up + high latency + increased error rate on the same service within a 5 min window is one incident, not three separate pages. Most monitoring tools are terrible at this out of the box tho, we ended up building some basic correlation logic ourselves. Theres some newer AI-powered observability tools that claim to do this automatically but honestly the ones ive tried are still pretty hit or miss.\n\nThe hard truth is alert fatigue is usually a symptom of not having clear SLOs defined. Once you know exactly what \"healthy\" looks like for each service, you only alert on deviations from that. Everything else becomes a dashboard metric you check during business hours",

The entire security assessment was based on outdated behavior. Had to basically start over.\n\nThe real question enterprises need to answer isn't \"should we adopt AI tools\" — it's \"can our governance model handle a tool that fundamentally changes every 6-8 weeks?\" Most enterprise procurement was designed for tools that ship 2-4 updates a year. AI tools are shipping weekly. That's a fundamental mismatch between the tool's release cadence and the org's review cadence.\n\nThe teams I've seen actually get through this treat it more like a browser — evaluate the general category once, set guardrails around data handling and output review, and then let updates flow without re-evaluating the entire stack each time.

I just don't understand where to look and where to find proper solutions.

In any case, I'll most likely leave team in the near future, but kinda obliged to at least set up some kind of real-time fraud monitoring for them, otherwise it would be unprofessional and unfair on my part.\n\nIf you’ve implemented this type of solutions and it actually reduced fraud or something like that, what worked for you?\n\n(pls **no companies names** as I don't want to turn this post into one big ad!!!)",

(in the repo)  \n\\- Are there any better DevOps skills to learn or is there anything that I'm lacking at the moment?\n\nSince most of the jobs I've seen heavily rely on Azure, that's why it's so heavily favored in the roadmap.\n\nThank you in advance for any input.

So depending on what you're applying to Jr vs non-jr I'm going to view your resume differently. \n\nIf you're applying for a Sr position, I more than likely won't care about your lab. You're a senior. It's like comparing the tree house you built in your backyard to standing up a building on the main street. I want to know what you've actually done in an environment where you don't have the luxury of time that you get with a home lab in a pristine environment where it's only you making changes.  That makes the assumption your lab has things we use. For example bragging about running K8s on your resume. That's great but we use ECS (not EKS or K8s) so pumping that lab up doesn't really tell me much especially when I've never ran k8s myself nor been in a position to run it. \n\nIf you are applying for a Jr position, I want to see a documented history of you doing at least sysadmin level work. Can you build out a server? Can you secure it? Can you configure apache/ngnix/iis? What have you automated in your workplace? What scripting languages do you know and what real world business situation did you fix with your script? Do you know how to interface with an API, take the results, and pass it to another API to glue two things that normally don't speak to each other? etc This stage your assists in helping me keep my questions at the level that makes sense for asking.",

It could be direct (trigger ansible, terraform, etc.) or indirect (create AWX request for higher level of abstraction and/or auditing).\n\nYou didn’t say what actions you need to take but you should be able to automate routine tasks… but be sure to think about how much authority to release. In some cases the fact that the person has access to Jira is enough since you have other controls like letting people only run three instances at a time.

It's an idea on the list I might try.\n\nDevelopers start by consuming the configurable GitHub workflow I created, calling it in their repo. They integrate by adding helm charts to their repo. They make a tiny PR to the platform repo to register their runners and ECR repos (abstracted as a list they add an entry to). So it's self service. Of course I have docs/guides as well. \n\nFrom there they just make PRs in their repo. If build passes, after merge, CI automatically makes another PR to bump the image referenced in the helm chart and they merge to release to EKS. Namespaced, and everything. \n\nI standardized local dev using Tilt and when the team wants I encourage using k8s with docker desktop because then they can just reuse the same helm charts locally as in prod.\n\nI have a team of like 10 devs who rotate between different internal projects all using it. The most complaints I've gotten are people who have crappy dev laptops (*cough*windows*cough*) and have trouble running containers locally.\n\nI suppose I could work towards automating even more of this. But no one is asking for it at the moment",
