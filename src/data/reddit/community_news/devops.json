I am not working anymore, I either use AI or when I start to use my brain, everyone around me answers with AI. I am not an angel, I am a junior that can’t learn properly because no one wants to, everyone wants AI and less human error.\n\nThe only thing it failed at was deep architecture like database migration and specific clustering, but everything else it simply just does it and when it doesn’t, we only have to do maybe a single thing to fix it. \n\nI am leaving the DevOps as a field and getting into security (was really interested in it before) but I genuinely feel like I was trolled and did nothing, and maybe even soon security would be replaced with AI.\n\nThis post may be stupid to seniors, but as a junior and people starting, this is reality. We don’t learn, we don’t grow, we are the ones getting replaced and I see no field being currently resistant to that. I will just get into moltbook and doom scroll.\n\nThank you for everyone who helped me pave my devops path, it is really one of the best fields I’ve ever went in and honored to have been here even if just for a short while, hopefully where I live is the problem and not the entire planet.",

                  "text": "That’s … not quite how aviation crew resource management happened, but you’re not far off. If I can clarify? \n\nExcept at a very very few select airports that have Cat. IIIb approaches with no minimums, the pilot always needs to make the decision to land and to take over and fly the last 50+ feet of altitude. This is dependent on having a specific set of ground equipment, and dependent on having the airplane equipped with certain equipment like HUD technology. Not all airliners are equipped for no-minimum-RVR approaches. Takeoffs are dependent on the aircraft equipment, the airport, and the pilots. Some do it by hand some depend entirely on automation. \n\nWhat you’re talking about with captains and first officers is … not quite correct. There still being a difference between captains and first officers is an acknowledgement that in an emergency there can only be one person in charge. Back in the day, this would be a deference that was explicit - the captain was always in charge, and the first officer is an assistant. After a few horrendous air accidents caused by the person “in charge” being incorrect and also unable to be challenged, cockpit culture was changed by training something called “Crew Resource Management” which made it clear that everyone is required to speak up when something is wrong no matter the “rank” and that air crew should divide tasks and then work their assigned tasks. CRM is incredibly effective at preventing accidents and it’s notable where it breaks down like the runway excursion at Roanoke last year. It’s also one of the reasons that single pilot commercial flights are a bad idea. \n\nFirst officers are not “inexperienced” and in modern US airlines will have about 1500 hours in the cockpit with the engines on before they’re allowed to fly passengers, and will have dozens of hours of structured training in simulators and flying the actual airplane type under a check captain before they’re allowed to crew a regular flight. Using my sister as an example, she had 300 hours when she became a flight instructor, 1200 hours before working for a small regional airline, and over 2500 hours with the engines going round before she got a job at a main line. As a first officer, she now has over 3,000 hours in the type of aircraft she flies. Still a first officer. Keeping in mind that a pilot’s work day is typically double the flight time or more, that’s quite a lot of working time. \n\nThe things that create safety in airlines (multiple crew, defined roles, structured training) are the things that tech companies are saying it’s too expensive to do for our jobs.",

I remember seeing a comment once about how it’s not math until it has letters - and I’m sure a lot of people would insist at least half of them need to be Greek letters. 🤓\n\nBut more seriously as a math BS (so still very lightweight) I think the main characteristic of math is that it’s entirely about relationships. Relationships that can be rigorously proven with a small set of acceptable tools.\n\nArithmetic is important, and will always be important in many areas, but there’s a strong argument that people who would be naturally gifted in mathematics are driven away by the mindless drudgery of K-8 arithmetic. People should always be able to add 2 and 3 in their head but many of us think good estimation is more important once you get above 100 or so. E.g, seeing 27 x 414 should tell you the result will be around 30 x 400 or 12000 because you know how to round up or down appropriately. That may be good enough by itself, or at least you’ll know there’s a problem if the calculator gives you a wildly different number. In this case it’s 11,178, so the estimate is off by less than 7%. But if the result was 21,000 you know enough to double check the values you saw and the values typed into the calculator or spreadsheet.",

But cloud and k8s are layers of abstractions built upon the real networks and real hardware. And they bring more layers, take software defined networks, or virtual k8s clu sters, and so on.  \n\nAnd ultimately, when shit hits the fan and you have a real problem with networking in your virtual clusters, guess what -- they don't have the skills to debug it. Some folks are not even able to read through a man page nowadays.\n\nNow add AI on top of that, and you have a perfect recipe for disaster. \nOn the other hand, that's exactly why senior engineers with real skills just grin sarcastically when they hear that AI will take our jobs. \n\nAI is a great tool, but if you don't understand what you are doing it won't help you. People used to copy-paste complex bash one-liners without understanding them, now they produce whole codebases without a slightest hint of understanding how \"their\" code works.

The *old* kind. Servers, procedures, change requests, actual humans touching things. It wasn’t glamorous, but it worked. Then DevOps showed up with YAML, pipelines, and a moral superiority complex.\n\nSuddenly everything we did was “legacy.”  \nToo slow.  \nToo manual.  \nToo human.\n\nThey didn’t fire us right away. That would’ve been rude. Instead, they stopped hiring. Knowledge was “documented.” Processes were “automated.” Our experience was “captured.” Eventually, the only time anyone talked to us was when something broke in production and the pipeline didn’t know why.\n\nThen they fixed that too.\n\nNow the company doesn’t need people like me. Not because the work disappeared — but because DevOps decided it was inefficient for humans to do it. Everything is codified, templated, versioned, and enforced by tools built by people who never had to be on call when the tools fail.\n\nThe DevOps team insists this is progress. Fewer mistakes. Faster deployments. More reliability. And sure — it works. Mostly. Until it doesn’t. And by then, there’s no one left who actually understands the system end-to-end.\n\nI thought this was just my company being reckless. Then I talked to others. Same story everywhere. Different industries, same outcome. DevOps rolls in, replaces the old guard, calls it “modernization,” and moves on.\n\nI’m not an angel. I wasn’t a rockstar. I was just someone who expected experience to matter longer than a tooling trend.\n\nNow I’m not working anymore. Not because I refused to adapt — but because there’s nothing left to adapt *into*. The system doesn’t want people. It wants conformity.\n\nSo I’m leaving the field. Not because I hate it, but because I watched it erase an entire generation of workers and call it optimization. And now it’s shocked that no one’s left when things go sideways.",

But honestly, anyone who's worked with Terraform for a while knows that's just not true. The state file runs the show.  \n  \nNot long ago, I hit a snag with a team sure they’d locked down their security groups - because that’s what their HCL said. But they had a pile of old resources that never got imported into the state, so Terraform just ignored them. The plan looked fine. Meanwhile, the environment was basically wide open.  \n  \nWe keep telling juniors, “If it’s in Git, it’s real.” That’s not how Terraform works. What we should say is, “If it’s in the state file, it’s managed. If it’s not, good luck.”  \n  \nSo, does anyone else force refresh-only plans in their pipelines to catch this kind of thing?

This shift was already initiated last year by moving towards Kubernetes, but we still use a dozen AWS services.

From the architecture angle I've been pushing our common patterns to function more multi-regional as stand-alone rather than traditional patterns that rely on at least an eventual global sync.  Meaning each regional stack is the source of truth for its service coverage such that San Paolo data stays in San Paolo.  If Virgina's regional stack isn't going to use San Paolo's data then why pay the costs to send it.  Separate the \"global\" services like authentication, but keeping them out of the application stacks makes it much easier to do this for the meat of the estate.\n\nMy sell for this to the C level is mostly a data sovereignty compliance story (GDPR, etc) with some cost-savings sugar, but avoiding global syncs means those \"fully private and reliable connections\" across regions don't have to be nearly as reliable and privacy covered by encryption, meaning site to site VPN over public trunks is just fine.  It's certainly more complex to architect properly, but there's a lot of savings to be found pushing the work closer to the users and *not* treating it like one single app and single source of truth.\n\nMany in AWS might notice this pattern looks familiar...and that's because it's how almost everything is built at AWS with only a very few \"global\" exceptions.\n\nThis all results in me effectively sunkworking a secret playbook for the fall of the US empire in plain sight, masked by boring legal compliance and finops cover stories.  We're not there today, oh god no, but this is the horizon line I'm keeping my company's ship headed towards as much as my influence allows.",

The biggest challenge is the operational overhead self-hosted solutions require.  On the application side, it's fairly straightforward to do the migration, as long as you don't use any provider-specific functions and stick with some open standard, e.g. OIDC.\n\nIf anyone has a suggestion here, I'd love to learn more about EU-based auth providers.\n\nLambdas/serverless, while usually considered as a biggest vendor lock, are fairly easy to migrate comparing to identity services.",

They slimmed teams from 7 to 2 and people leaving are not replaced. That, while they expect to keep the same deadlines as before. I told them multiple times before and after the layoffs, stuff isn't going to finish on schedule, and before the layoffs they said they know. Well, f*cking own it now.  For such a company nobody wants to work overtime anyway, and people are outright demotivated. \n\nI've been searching for a role since November, but so far i'm only ghosted by recruiters and didn't even get to have 1 tech interview. I'm a DevOps with 20 years of experience and worked both as freelancer and permanent in the Netherlands.\n\nI think the dream job would be like Bernie Sanders said: if AI makes us so much more efficient, then agree to let people work less, for example 4 days work while keeping the same output. Not firing them and put all the pressure on the remaining people.\n\nAlso it's a myth that AI improves performance, in most cases it actually makes you slower: https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/11/ai_code_tools_slow_down/",

The AI hype that companies are using to cut costs, and the growing number of people training in computer science, definitely have something to do with it. Best of luck with your job search. \n\nHowever, I am fairly skeptical about the study you shared on AI reducing performance instead of improving it. That study is already over 6 months old, so it must have been done on late 2024 / early 2025 models. When you see the significant progress in models and tools over these last 6 months, and competent devs / ops who have completely changed their stance on AI during that period, I also think AI can genuinely accelerate one's productivity right now (at least it makes mine better on repetitive tasks).",

At the same time theres a pretty chunky oversupply of juniors which cant really be put to use as theres not enough capacity among existing seniors to actually train them into mediors/seniors.",

      "text": "So I'm a freelance developer and have been doing this now for 4-5 years, with half of my responsibilites typically in infra work. I've done all sorts of public/private sector stuff for small startups to large multinationals. In infra, I administer and operate anything from the single VPC AWS machine + RDS to on-site HPC clusters. I also operate some Kubernetes clusters for clients, although I'd say my biggest blindspot is yet org scale platform engineering and large public facing services with dynamic scaling, so take the following with a grain of salt.\n\nNow that I'm doing this for a while, I gained some intuition about the things that are more important than others. Earlier, I was super interested in best possible uptimes, stability, scalability. These things obviously require many architectural considerations and resources to guarantee success. \n\nNow that I'm running some stuff for a while, my impression is that many of the services just don't have actual requirements towards uptime, stability and performance that would warrant the engineering effort and cost. \n\nIn my quest to simplify some of the setups I run, I found what probably the old schoolers knew all along. Systemd+Journald is the GOAT (even for containerized workloads). I can go some more into detail on why I think this, but I assume this might not be news to many. Why is it though, that in this subreddit, nobody seems to talk about it? There are only a dozen or so threads mentioning it throughout recent years. Is it just a trend thing, or are there things that make you really dislike it that I might not be aware off?",

And now, suddenly, it's easier to throw everything into Kubernetes. Running things as systemd units loses a lot of its luster when you already have a kubernetes cluster laying around. And then it's easier to monitor those things in kubernetes if you use the Prometheus metrics stack because you automatically get metrics endpoint monitoring via the Prometheus ServiceMonitor CRD. And then it's easier to collect logs out of your applications because you likely already have something like Alloy/Vector/Promtail shipping kubernetes logs to a centralized logging database. And then it's easier to set up networking/DNS records because you likely already have an Ingress Controller to make your workloads reachable to the outside world, External-DNS to create your DNS records, and then instead of setting up certbot as yet another systemd unit to generate your TLS certificates you have something like cert-manager already in the cluster that will do it for you. And then instead of using something like monit to toggle your systemd units when they fail (as yet another systemd unit), you just have kubernetes doing that with its builtin container restarting behavior.\n\nI hear people call it resume driven systems admin, when it's really just kind of not true. It's ignoring how much Kubernetes ecosystem tooling does for you, that you aren't quantifying when you just say \"this could be a systemd unit.\" More like \"this could be a whole collection of systemd units, terraform, Ansible, and templated out service config files.... or just one Dockerfile and Helm values file.\" There just is no such thing as a good faith discussion about Kubernetes that starts off with \"this could just be a systemd unit\" because at that point you've already told a lie.",

The original architects are gone and now the push is on for major cost reduction. The only realistic path to meaningful savings (30-50%+) is a full re architect: right-sizing, VPC endpoints everywhere, single AZ where it makes sense, proper lifecycle policies, workload isolation, maybe even shifting compute patterns to Graviton/Fargate/Spot/etc.\n\nBut I’m dead set against taking that on myself rn  \n  \nThis is live production…… one mistake and everything will be down for FFS  \n  \nI don’t have the full historical context or design rationale for half the decisions.\n\n* No test/staging parity, no shadow traffic, limited rollback windows.\n* If I start ripping and replacing while running ops, the blast radius is huge and I’ll be the one on the incident bridge when it goes sideways.\n\nI’m basically stuck: there’s strong pressure for big cost wins but no funding for a proper redesign effort, no architects/consultants brought in and no acceptance that “small tactical optimizations won’t move the needle enough”.

All too often, when I ask if we can improve something, I get told “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”, even if “it ain’t broke” is actually just “it’s barely functional”.\n\nHere, they’re handing you a chance to improve a deeply broken thing on a silver platter, and you’re rejecting it.

If your outage is scheduled and communicated the impact on your users is minimal and you’ll get a lot less heat than if it goes down by accident. \n\nYou’re also likely making half that. \n\nIf nothing else a situation like this is an easy combo with higher ups to effectively get on yourself, “give me 6 months and I’ll cut the cost in half, I want a a full months worth of savings as a bonus or a title bump/promotion to DevOps Architect or whatever. You can be a superstar if you save the company anywhere near a quarter mil a year. \n\nThis isn’t experienced devs so I won’t harp on you too much but at this point you should have been able to understand the existing architecture to at least have an idea of what can safely be turned off, spun down, or migrated. \n\nAnd you can’t be this worried about taking down prod. From feature flags to full blue/green rollouts, robust testing and monitoring all the info and lessons learned are out there to absorb and implement. \n\nFrankly if you were brand new there’d be little better a situation to step in where you can immediately demonstrate your exact dollar value to the company.",

      "text": "Not sure if it's the best place to share this, but let's give it a try.  \n  \nA few years back, I was looking for a new job and managed to get an interview for a young SaaS startup. I wanted to try out their product before the interview came up, but, obviously, it was pretty much all locked behind paywalls.\n\nI was still quite junior at the time, working at my first job for about 2 years. We had a staging environment, so I wondered: maybe they do as well?\n\nI could have listed their subdomains and looked from there, but I was a noob and got lucky by just trying: [`app-staging.company.com`](http://app-staging.company.com)\n\nAnd I was in! I could create an account, subscribe to paid features using a Stripe test card (yes, I was lucky as well: they were using Stripe, as we did in my first job), and basically use their product for free.\n\nThis felt crazy to me, and I honestly felt like that hackerman meme, even though I didn’t know much about basic security myself. I’ll let you imagine the face of the CEO when he asked me if I knew a bit about their product and I told him I could use it for free.\n\nHe was impressed and honestly a bit shocked that even a junior with basic knowledge could achieve this so easily. I didn’t get the job in the end, as he was looking for an established senior, but that was a fun experience.\n\nIf you want to know a bit more about the story, I talk about it in more detail here:  \n[https://medium.com/@arnaudetienne/is-your-staging-environment-secure-d6985250f145](https://medium.com/@arnaudetienne/is-your-staging-environment-secure-d6985250f145) (no paywall there, only a boring Medium popup I can’t disable)",

At minimum: separate auth (SSO or VPN, or at least IP allowlists), separate Stripe project or sandbox with clear flags, and a big visual banner so screenshots and links don’t leak and confuse everyone.\n\n\n\nI also like treating staging URLs as secrets in themselves: no obvious app-staging.\\* patterns, and auto-expiring preview environments per PR. Tools like Cloudflare Access and Tailscale make it pretty painless, and I’ve used Snyk plus Pulse for Reddit and Datadog to catch when those staging quirks start leaking into user-facing issues or public chatter. The main point: if it’s on the internet, someone’s going to poke it, even if they’re “just a candidate.",

For many, the cloud promised instant and cheap scalability without the huge capex every few years to upgrade/replace equipment, but it didn't pan out that way.\n\nLift-and-shift cloud migrations mirrored their on-prem infrastructure usually in the form of dozens of VMs running workloads. Over time, these systems were migrated to cloud-native technologies like Docker/K8 and the legacy VMs eventually shutdown. Which makes their applications way more portable and easy to move. Easy enough, in fact, may as well just migrate it back to on-prem.\n\nSmaller orgs, it's not happening that way. The initial capex of building a data center is just too much $$$.

The contradiction dissolves once you realize we're not choosing between \"all cloud\" or \"all on-prem\" anymore—we're building hybrid stacks out of necessity. K8s actually makes that mess manageable, which is probably why adoption keeps climbing even as repatriation does.\n\n  \nThe $600B capex bet is wild though. Hyperscalers are banking on AI inference costs dropping dramatically once they hit scale, but they're currently losing money on every workload. That only works if they either (a) crush operating costs through automation, or (b) charge enough to make margin when their utilization finally maxes out. Neither is guaranteed.\n\n  \nWhat actually kills me is watching teams self-host inference on cheaper hardware and getting better latency + cost than cloud pricing. That trend alone might explain the repatriation spike better than any compliance story.",

The story seems to be the same everywhere I go: A) join promising startup, do interesting work for a few years, C-suite cycles out, company either crashes, spins it's wheels for another few years, or we get acquired, or B) come close to jumping off a bridge studying for big tech roles, only to get to the final round to be told, \"hey, we were just kidding about full remote the three times you asked us, we need you in [insert city 1000 miles away here with a 2.5x CoL]\". If the market was better I'd start pivoting towards full on software engineering, but alas, many of our glorious technological leaders decided it was a good idea to cozy up to whatever governmental facade of the time would give them quick quarterly wins and over-gorged shareholders, so here we are.\n\nFor those of you older DevOps folk that successfully escaped and made career transitions without taking huge hits to your comp, what are you doing these days? Are you happy (or at least content)? Do you have regrats? \n\nA quick search seems like a lot of the threads asking these questions as of late are from AI doomers (which you know, understandable, I get it and hate it... but damn does it make reading Terraform docs so much easier) and folks unknowingly knee deep in a burn-out cycle; I want to hear from people that took the plunge and are happy with it, or at the very least, content not being in Cloud Infrastructure.",

I spend all day doing R&D, teaching, and in meetings protecting my guys who do the real work.  I don't do any tickets, just assign them, and assist my team members who need help on them.  It's a totally different job IMHO than Sysadmin or even most DevOps jobs.  I think I'm good at it, but it does require a lot of soft skills most of us didn't work on over the years.\n\nI have to keep up with the latest skills of course, but I'm not doing the busy work anymore. Getting paid to read Hacker News is a pretty good job though.\n\nIn meetings I now am treated as the expert I always believed I was, but now they pay attention.  I get to tell them \"no\" unless they have a business plan that accounts for paying for my team.\n\nI have to deal with vendor BS and they all want constant meetings, so fending them off is a pain though, but a mostly new pain in my career.\n\nI encourage AI usage on my team, but reinforce over and over that it should not be trusted.  It's harvested it's knowledge of DevOps from Medium or LinkedIn posts that are written by junior people wanting to get a job.  It's good at some stuff that's over-documented like AWS APIs, but it's really bad at telling you about how to do stuff at scale because 95% of what it's learned are not from Sr. DevOps people because we don't have time to write blogs about stuff.\n\nI'm not worried about being replaced by AI before I retire.  I don't think you should be.\n\nWhat I am worried about is hiring.  There are an awful lot of underskilled people thinking DevOps is entry level and it shows in all of the resumes I've seen in the last few years.  The youngest guy on my team is 40.  What happens as we all age out and AI is still learning from the 20 year old writing a blog about his home lab who doesn't know anything about Linux and just uses \"Docker compose\" on an untrusted repo to build all their systems then has no clue how to actually support it?  It'll end up being the next Exerian, Target or whatever hack where we get more free identity protection.\n\nEdit:  AI is good at coding, because it's structured and well documented in thousands of books.  It's only good at a few things in DevOps because there is a lot less good documentation except for APIs, CLIs and configuration files.  Actual implementation is a bit more complicated than that.",

You couldn't write slop...you were lucky to have 48K of RAM!  If you wanted to do cool things... assembly.  So as we added abstraction after abstraction I was able to stack the understanding.  That's a really unique experience compared to being tossed into Kubernetes and told to \"learn this.\"\n\nWhere am I going from here?  Gotta have health insurance.  But I'd love to continue to learn more about how to do this on my own.  Anyone need an Observability cost audit?",

Yet I care less by the day. Once I have permanent residency I’ll start being more ballsy with pushback on dumb things, and eventually I’ll be fired and open up a French fry food truck or something with an American flag in a foreign land. Really, it’s not the work, it’s the absolute incompetency of our leadership who run a tech company without knowing the difference between http/https (yes that’s our CTO). I’ll never work for a company that hires in India ever again either. Every US employee hates them for being snakes and scammers, and if the economy wasn’t shit, many of us would have walked out sooner. I’m tired boss. I also have to babysit developers and teach them that LRU eviction in redis does not mean you can write shit code pushing cache without TTL hoping that our infrastructure will handle evictions on your 32gb of garbage cache dating back to 2024",

If you want to tinker with a bigger VM for testing or need a GPU, you can just start a VM in the UI that is sized for your workload.\n\nThe organization can manage templates and security much better since the IT admin stays in control of the infrastructure. Also for security no random ssh keys, or firewall rules you conect using the coder agent.\n\nFinally, some people need a development environment but don't have the \"VPS admin\" knowledge. For example, a data analyst might want a \"Jupyter Notebook\" button one click away without having to tinker with the backend",

You can even design your devcontainers as an extension of the containers you deploy for prod to make them even more \"as close to prod as possible\". \n\nYou can either do devcontainers locally, but if your users are running MacOS, that means you have to make sure your images are allowed/able to build for arm64 and _do not use Rosetta_ to try to emulate amd64. That might mean building arm64 images in your CI to make sure it always works or something, but that is another can of worms. Also, if you have any IO intensive apps (literally anything using Node.js because of `node_modules`), you will have to make sure developers clone repos inside of volumes inside of your Docker Engine VM (VS Code and JetBrains both support it). Otherwise, you will be bind mounting your files from the host into the VM and get really bad IO performance. \n\nFor remote, Codespaces will probably be the best experience if you already use Github. It is all there, but I know GitPod is also devcontainer based. Any of the devcontainer based ones should be great.

Basically, to really stop someone determined, you’ll need SELinux or AppArmor.\n\nAn easier solution would be to have ephemeral VMs (which sounds an awful lot like a container), with $HOME mounted to a network share, or at least a persistent disk. Let people experiment as they see fit in the VM, but make it very clear that every night / weekend (whatever makes sense for your work), everything not in $HOME goes away, so they **must** have dependencies properly saved, etc.\n\nEven then, you *still* run the risk of someone creating a special snowflake with a shell script that they run after every reset, but at that point, it’s more of a personnel issue rather than a technical one.\n\nYou might also consider CI being the ultimate arbiter. If a build doesn’t pass in CI, with an agreed-upon and controlled environment, *it doesn’t pass.* It’s then up to the devs to figure out what drift they’ve introduced.

Instead of manual updates, Argo CD now handles rolling out apps wherever needed in the system. Monitoring runs through Grafana, which pulls data via Node Exporter, showing everything on a live screen.\n\nA fixed IP now links to the host, set through DHCP so it stays the same even when power cycles happen, making remote logins smooth. Skipping Ubuntu's desktop (GNOME) layer freed up roughly 1.5 gigs of memory, leaving extra room for cluster tasks.\n\nMy question: **Would this be considered resume‑worthy for a DevOps/Cloud/Infra role?**   \nIf yes, how should I frame it — as a homelab project, a personal project, or something else?\n\nAny advice on how recruiters view homelab projects like this would be super helpful!\n\nThanks in advance ",

Had a few good candidates through and no one mentioned homelab or similar.  Then one guy came in, really good in all areas, except Kubernetes which was a big part of the role.  All his resume said was \"learning Kubernetes\" so I brought that up and asked how are you learning it and he said \"I have a homelab where I use 3x Raspberry Pi running K3s\".....  Interview took a 15minute detour into him talking passionatly about his homelab setup and us comparing notes.\n\nHe got the job and has been one of best engineers I have ever worked with.....and he still homelabs now.",

When your prod deploy fails at 2am because some upstream Helm repo is having an outage, you'll wish you had vendored. With ArgoCD specifically, you can use a Helm chart repository as a source but pin to exact versions. The middle ground that works well: keep your Chart.yaml with dependencies pointing to upstream repos, but commit the charts/ directory (the output of helm dependency build). That way you have the full source vendored for reliability, but the Chart.yaml still documents where it came from and what version you're on. Run helm dependency update in CI periodically to check for new versions. For the security angle, Renovate or Dependabot can watch your Chart.yaml and open PRs when new chart versions drop, so you get visibility into updates without manually checking.",

      "text": "I work at a mid-sized AEC firm (\\~150 employees) doing automation and computational design. I'm not a formally trained software developer - I started in a more traditional domain expertise role and gradually moved into writing C# tools, add-ins, and automation scripts. There's one other person doing similar work, but we're largely self-taught.\n\nOur file infrastructure runs on a Linux Samba server with 100TB+ of data stored serving all 150 + maybe 50 more users. The development workflow that existed when I started was to work directly on the network drives. The other automation developer has always done this with smaller projects for years and it seemed to work fine.\n\n**What Happened**\n\nI started working on a project to consolidate scattered scripts and small plugins into a single, cohesive add-in. This meant creating a larger Visual Studio solution with 30+ projects - basically migrating from \"loose scripts on the network\" to \"proper solution architecture on the network.\"\n\nOver 7-8 days, the file server experienced complete outages lasting 30-40 minutes daily. Users couldn't access files, work stopped, and IT had to investigate. IT traced the problem to my user account holding approximately **120 simultaneous file handles** \\- significantly more than any other user (about 30).\n\nThe IT persons sent an email to my manager and his boss saying that it should be investigated what I'm doing and why I could be locking so many files basically framing it as if I am the main cause of the outages. The other cause they have stated is that the latest version of the main software used in the AEC field (Autodesk Revit) is designed to create many small files locked by each individual user which even though true, to me sounds like a ridiculous statement as a cause for the server to crash.\n\nShould a production file server serving 200 users be brought down by one user's 120 file handles? I've already moved to local development - that's not the question. I want to understand whether I did something genuinely problematic or the server couldn't handle normal development workload. Even if my workflow was suboptimal, should it be possible for one developer opening Visual Studio to bring down the entire file server for half an hour? This feels like a capacity planning issue.",

The server was already at its limits and your workflow just happened to be the straw that broke it. The real question IT should be asking is why their file server has no connection limits, no resource quotas per user, and apparently no monitoring that would have caught it before a 30-40 minute outage. A properly configured Samba instance handles thousands of concurrent handles without breaking a sweat. You were right to move to local dev, but don't let them frame this as your fault. This is an infrastructure problem.",

Modern engineering reliability practices strongly encourage taking a blameless postmortem approach.  The right question isn’t “who fault was it?”, but rather “what do we need to change in our code, tools, process, etc so this type of thing doesn’t happen again?”. Did the user/staff/whoever make a mistake?  Yeah, probably… because they are human and humans fuck up.

Are the hours making you questioning your life choices etc. I'm looking to hearing genuine personal opinions. \n\nI have a networking background and I currently work as a network engineer. I have several Cisco, AWS and Azure certifications and I have been doing this for a while. I fell in love with networking instantly and I still love it to this day. However it's a lot of the same and I have to travel/be away from my family more than I'd like. I have diagnosed ADHD which I am medicated for and it's been a blessing in my life. However, it's no secret that we get extra bored of repetitive tasks if there's nothing new and exciting. \n\nHere I feel like the DevOps career is something that could be right up my alley, the amount of knowledge you need to have to just get started, the constantly changing environment, the never ending learning and the fact that there always seems to be something to do. Please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nI am now legible for a \"scholarship\" of sorts to get a 2 year DevOps education for free and I wonder if you'd take that chance if it was you? I was super excited until I realised that I have barely done any coding and sure there's courses in coding covered in this education but there are also many other things. But since I have experience in other things covered I could focus more on the coding aspect. Do you think two years will be enough experience to get into a junior DevOps role without being a burden to said company?\n\nThank you for your time.\n\n/M",

With job layoffs and AI automation being hot right now, the stability is an unknown. \n\n\nFrom a technical perspective, things move much quicker now than it used to. For you personally with your background, you could have a big advantage over someone who jumps straight into DevOps with no background. We are expected to deal with anything that comes our way and networking and sysops experience helps with that a lot. \n\nTo be a high earner now, you are expected to know software engineering, and most high earnings companies expect former SE levels. \n\nThere is so much that depends on the company you work for, since DevOps and platform engineering vary as much as the title engineer does. If you work for a company that treats DevOps as an engineering discipline, you will be treated like an equal. For most, you are a support org, so you can be treated similarly to help desk or app support. \n\nThere's so much more I could say, but there's a lot of variables.",

Throughout my career, I tried DevOps with stronger focus on coding and I didn't like it that much, so infrastructure development / automation is what I'd call my favorite area.\n\nSecondly, I think our job secured against AI, because no sane business will let LLM agents operate the prod.\n\nThirdly, I worked in DevOps consultancy for some time and got to work with a huge variety of smaller companies. The symptom of a software development team without dedicated infra guy is always the same: they burn a lot of money by (1) using the cloud inefficiently (2) accumulating massive technical debt in their automation — or not having automation at all.\n\nSo, I think we can be called by different names in the future (Platform / Cloud / Site Reliability / Infrastructure Engineers - no one really likes the term \"DevOps,\" TBH), but our profession is far from being redundant for years to come.\n\nGood luck with whatever path you decide to pursue!",

The danger is as the term drops out of trend the roles dry up.\n\nAnd a new term comes along. \"Platform\" Engineering is often the new term these days! \n\nAs a former Director I explicitly avoided DevOps engineer roles when forming hiring plans. Instead looking for Software Engineers that were able to work across the stack and understood DevOps. We'd focus on skillset in terms of gaps in the team. \n\nPersonally, if working with software, I'd keep levelling up my coding skills and find a place where they practice DevOps as part of software delivery. This is the space I work in. \n\nOr if more on the Ops side, you're likely looking for somewhere that runs k8s (so more likely a larger / enterprise company - startups and even SMEs shouldn't really be touching it). Such roles may still be called \"DevOps\". But also look for Cloud Engineer roles or Platform roles.",

The real change I've seen is combining teams and dropping members, what used to be a team of 8-16 devs is now 1-5. You do more, you work more, you take on more and they'll replace you once your output drops because everyone is desperate for a role, I know, I've had to let a number go and I only hire when there are projects or budgeted money available, which is not getting better.\n\nYou need rates to go down so credit and spending goes up, most companies are tightening their belts, not hiring.",
