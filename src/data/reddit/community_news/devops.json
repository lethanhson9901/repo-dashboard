Originally, it was supposed to be about breaking down silos and shared responsibility, but in many places, it has just turned into a dumping ground for everything the dev team doesn't want to deal with.\n\nIf a deployment fails, it’s a DevOps problem. If the cloud bill is too high, it’s a DevOps problem. If a database is slow, call DevOps. We’ve gone from \"building platforms\" to just being the people who get paged at 3 AM because a script we didn't write failed in a way we couldn't predict. We are spending so much time putting out fires that we don't have the bandwidth to actually automate the systems that prevent them.\n\nI’ve been trying to document some better boundaries and automation patterns on OrbonCloud lately.\nAre we just stuck as the \"everything\" engineers now?",

The tools changed, some attitudes changed, and there was a net benefit in smoothing out some chaotic processes from experiments into convention, but at its core it was always about solving the problems involved in making your software work with the resources you had available.\n\nWhat you're seeing is the result of that experimentation slowing in regards to software delivery pipeline development, as various patterns have been tried and the most commonly accepted standards have coalesced.\n\nSpecific development roles are undergoing a new round of domain specialization with the ascent of AI tooling and the quirks they introduce. The focus on experimentation is shifting away from pipeline design to AI tooling efficiency and how to make use of it in testing, security, and observability.\n\nHence, if you were hired as a DevOps engineer, you'll now be saddled with not only making sure the development pipelines are working, but that the production systems they feed are operating and that the feedback loop (which we used to try to send to developers) is plugged into some AI-driven analysis toolset and delivering useful feedback.\n\n**tl;dr**: this was always what the job was, people just give it different names based on the technological zeitgeist",

Like Isaiah Berlin's old \"foxes and hedgehogs\" metaphor. When Kim and Humble packaged the DevOps role, they did a lot of work to carve out a lot of what amounted to generalists' responsibilities and line them up as specialties that could be fit together and served more efficiently overall by arranging them as a series of tightly integrated roles.\n\nNow that those arrangements are well-understood, it's become more useful (or rather, businesses are motivated to narrow their personnel) to have a \"specialist\" who can understand the whole system— and once again, generalize over it.\n\nTBF, I'm just restating myself all over again.

PagerDuty with a rotation.  And as their leader I make sure all of the on-call people get time off to make up for it. 99% of the time our pages come during the day because of stuff our dev team is doing.  I've not been paged after hours in quite a few months.  That took a long time to accomplish.  No fire fighting.\n\nBut for us DevOps is way different than our Dev team.  They work with project managers, do standups, and focus on new project initiatives.  My team does the CI/CD, the infrastructure in the cloud,  security stuff, builds them out their dev environments, and most importantly the tech debt.  We upgrade them to new versions of OS, programing languages, etc.  It's a treadmill that a pure development team rarely will do.\n\nA tiny team might think DevOps is all dev + all ops.  We're a medium team.  That just doesn't work.\n\nWe've also got enough people to deal with cloud pricing, database issues, etc.  We've got a couple experts at MySQL who aren't quite DBAs like in the past which maybe only have a job at a huge corporation now,  but we're all really smart.\n\nThis sounds like a problem at your company, not with the role.",

It will page the owning team, and on-call can page other teams if necessary. Without knowing who owns what, you cannot even do that.\n\nWhen working with a management team that sets clear team principles, your team must be able to reject tickets that fall outside your team's responsibility. \n\n\\>it has just turned into a dumping ground for everything the dev team doesn't want to deal with.\n\nThis has nothing to do with DevOps or anything else; a lack of OLA and ownership ultimately leads to this.

Took me a while to wrap my head around it.\n\nThe name basically originates from kubelet (a quadlet is a flattened kubelet) or if you squash a kube you get a quad. Thinking about it from the kubelet direction helped me grasping what red hat is trying to do.",

As a beginner, it feels overwhelming to remember so many commands and configurations. In real jobs, do engineers memorize most commands, or is it normal to rely on documentation, notes, and previously written scripts?\n\nAlso, how different is interview expectation compared to actual on-the-job work?\nI’m asking this genuinely to understand what I should focus on while learning.",

Cloud or onpremise, application, database, monolith and decoupling application, migration, security, networking, infrastructure, boot strapping, front end - backend, monitoring, backups, AI - ML, service bus and event driven actions\n\nPretty well it can encompass everything and anything just depends on the field your doing... A very good DevOps person is also a technical architect or generalist in every area not just specific for one area... \n\nIf you want to be paid and be top of the field you become an architect in each area, learn all of the above - as your going to SDWAN for networking or build a whole cloud landingzone as IAC, then you could be doing ansible or PowerShell DSC to boot strap or apply application updates to Linux or windows machines in a hybrid cloud... Your going to deal with automation for VMware then next thing your doing is micro services and decoupling for kubernetes but needing to know how to do CI/CD with GitHub, azure DevOps, Jenkins ect\n\nThe way I look at DevOps now days is completely different scenario from if someone asked me 5-8 years ago... I am a senior technical architect and has taken me 10+ years to get here but very junior guys in the DevOps world are either focused on just one field your doing app Dev work or your learning all services for onpremise and cloud to be able to implement the services and connections for web or applications even security or networking\n\nThe only real answer here is that you can be a DevOps SME in one specific area and make good money but if you want to level up and be that standout you must not limit yourself to one area as IT changes so much best thing to do is start a home lab and use something like the cloud native landscape website and learn as much as possible play with as many different fields and be hands on its where you learn",

Devops at least lets you be creative and write some code, where as SRE is just responding to breached thresholds and ultimately figuring out how shitty code gets to prod.

Add realistic incident scenarios - database connection pool exhaustion, memory leaks, cascading failures\n\n2. Include cost optimization challenges - right-sizing instances, identifying unused resources\n\n3. Add monitoring/observability mechanics - setting up alerts, dashboards, log aggregation\n\n4. Consider multiplayer mode where teams compete to maintain uptime while deploying features\n\n\n\nThe infrastructure management aspect is interesting. Would be great to see CI/CD pipeline building and Kubernetes cluster management as mechanics. Good luck with the project!",

Facebook's architecture would bankrupt a normal company, and their IaC is mostly custom internal tooling, not standard Terraform.\n\nBut the two closest resources to what you want are probably:\n\n1. System Design Interview (Alex Xu) Vol 1 & 2: It’s technically for interviews, but it'ss pretty much a recipe book for 'How do I build YouTube/Uber/Google Drive?' It covers the architecture patterns really well.\n2. Cloud Posse (GitHub): If you want to see actual production-grade IaC code, look at their Terraform modules. They're open source and I think the most comprehensive 'Reference Architecture' you can read for free.",

For bad reasons, their MySQL database had grown to 12TB which meant a migration where we’d shift the database wasn’t going to be a possibility, as it would take too much downtime.\n\nWhat we had to do instead was boot the new app in our infra in AMS and connect it temporarily to the MySQL in Ireland but as soon as we did that, the app would fall over as each API request was making ~45 database calls to MySQL which had gone from ~1ms to ~20ms.\n\nThe solution was to create a VPN gateway so that traffic router from Ireland would go through a GCP Ireland PoP and get routed through Google’s internal backbone to egress into Ams which dropped the latency of each database request down to a much more manageable 8ms. Not amazing, but manageable for a short migration window.\n\nDealing with the VPN config and the BGP settings in GCP was a nightmare. You never knew if you were being routed via their internal network or escaping into the WAN and if you got that wrong it would send you down a wild goose chase.\n\nMaybe not the most difficult thing I’ve done, but I spent two days staring at this and it drove me near crazy.",

It started off small, maybe 5 or 6 AWS instances to run some processing and spit out some fancy data. No idea how it worked, I was the backend guy setting it up with Chef and automation. Well, then someone wanted a visualization of the data, so that got added. But then a new guy wanted a different visualization package, but the original one was in too wide a use (even though it wasn't actually in prod yet) to just replace, so now we had two separate big visualization and data processors sitting on top. Then they wanted to do a full mapreduce on it to further enrich the data or something, which required another whole big infrastructure on top of it using MapR. Then they wanted to export all that data to a couple big warehouses, again more than one because the team involved couldn't agree on one. In the end the 5 or 6 instances ballooned to over 100, all barely working properly and barely fitting together using my handspun chef and terraform setups. We'd spent over a million dollars up to that point and absolutely none of it was actually \"prod\", and the monthly costs of all the cloud infra plus license costs for all the bits and bobs was astronomical.\n\nAbout a year in the C-suite finally took notice and started looking into it. Turned out the relatively new senior manager who was heading up the plan was a cofounder and early investor or something in the main big data processor thing that got added in and was a major part of the expense. The whole thing was a giant mess and never worked properly. The manager was let go rather loudly, as well as a few folks he'd brought in, and the engineering department ended up having a big party where we tore down the whole infrastructure bit by bit. Imagine the Office Space fax machine scene except everyone was taking turns clicking Terminate on AWS instances. Even though I was the main engineer on the project handling the backend, basically everyone had been dragged into it at some point and had a vendetta. It probably ultimately cost a couple million that went nowhere, which wasn't immediately fatal but a decent chunk of money for a company our size. They ended up getting acquired a year or so later and I wouldn't be surprised if the fallout from this was part of why it was necessary.\n\nOne part of why it got this bad was my team, the syseng/devops/infrastructure/whatever they were calling it that week, didn't have a direct manager for a good couple years for various reasons. So I was basically at the whim of the other manager(s) and didn't have someone watching my back that I could report to even though I knew it was going south. And the senior manager guy had a lot of sway at the company so nobody really listened to me.",

There are still some stateful configurations that I would not manage in IaC. For instance: Okta group and app assignments should happen based on Group Rules as much as possible, but there will always be plenty of cases where a user has to be manually assigned to a group. Unless there was some edge case caveat that required it, I would not manage bespoke group assignments for users in Terraform.

          "text": "The single biggest reason I ever use ClickOps is because my CSP (AWS) is likely to automatically automate creation of most of the supporting infrastructure through ClickOps but not through IaC. For example, the web EC2 launch flow will walk me through creating everything from security group to VPC to IAM role / policy, key attachments, etc etc. Versus with Terraform, I would have to define every single one of these resources verbosely as separate blocks, often requiring two resources per soas to perform attachments.\n\nSo it is definitely quicker for me to spin up an EC2 instance using ClickOps as compared to using Terraform, which leads to my using ClickOps for incredibly self-contained one-off tests (usually in separate “sandbox” sub account from production infrastructure). As soon as I am ready to productionize something, it moves to IaC and I eat the cost of writing all of the resource definitions / attachments, accept that this makes my work more auditable / reproducible / controlled.\n\nOther reasons people may opt for ClickOps over IaC:\n- easier to get off the ground; if I’m “learning AWS”, i may be following AWS-specific tutorials that tell you to use console and never even mention Terraform.\n- may require less permissions; integrating with an org’s existing IaC often requires greater permissions than using ClickOps — read/write to state, permissions to interact with existing projects, etc.\n- always quicker for one off tasks — indeed, I have used click ops once or twice for production cases in the past ~year as a breakglass mechanism to support emergency temporary workarounds eg temporary policy attachments. Not a massive auditability issue thanks to CloudTrail\n\nTL;DR IaC is almost always better for production-ready, reviewed, reusable infrastructure. ClickOps is quicker to spin up incredibly small self-contained resources with few interdependencies.",

So when someone just needs a bucket, a queue, or a one-off change, the console feels faster—and often *safer*—than touching a brittle pipeline they don’t fully understand.\n\nMost teams I’ve seen don’t reject IaC outright; they stall somewhere along the way on **usability**. Core infrastructure is codified, but day-2 changes, experiments, and exceptions quietly fall back to the UI.\n\nA big part of this is that tools like Terraform, Pulumi, Ansible (hell, even Kubernetes) are often treated *as the platform*, rather than tools for building one. That shifts a lot of operational responsibility and domain knowledge onto developers, even though cloud APIs themselves are a messy mix of ops and app concerns.\n\nUntil infrastructure workflows are genuinely easier than the console for non-experts, ClickOps is going to keep winning in practice.\n\nI wrote more about why IaC adoption seems stuck, would love to hear others thoughts.

Even for people who have some amount of automation in place already, if you're doing something new that is PoC-level, the time investment to write it in TF upfront is not necessarily appealing either. We know that of course that's mortgaging the time savings at the outset for the tech debt of importing into a module later on. But delivery is what people get judged for by management at the end of the day. Not how well-designed or maintained their infra is.\n\nThat being said, it's easy to enforce this if you really want to. Just remove user permissions to create resources partially/entirely. That way they are forced to use IAC/pipelines/Backstage/whatever to provision things. But be prepared to be screamed at when you tank their velocity.\n\nThe 'devops' ideal should be working together to meet people where they're at, and provide them the automation to self-manage what they need to do with guardrails. Once you've done so, make it impossible not to use the new tooling. Just like devs shouldn't throw all infra/ops stuff 'over the wall', you also shouldn't throw an opinionated way of doing things back over that wall that doesn't meet their needs.

I see commenters saying they like to use it for prototyping, POC, etc. Honestly, I find terraform to be simpler and I don't use AWS web gui for all that much. If the POC turns into something we might intend to keep around, we're going to want to turn it into IaC anyway, just do it up front. It's not a lot of work, you have auto-complete in most modern editors, and co-pilot if you swing that way.\n\n  \nEdit: The lack of peer-review and reproducibility is enough reason to outright ban ClickOps in my opinion. I don't think there is any good reason for anyone who is not a super-admin to have access to ClickOps for cloud services.",

This was aimed primarily at AWS, which was monetizing their product, but it ended up alienating many of their own supporters as well.  ES also had a history of being somewhat difficult to manage at scale (balancing shards, JVM issues, nodes joining/leaving) and new development stalled.  While the licensing changes were eventually reversed (and AWS forked the project into OpenSearch), this all led to a lot of other tools gaining traction, especially as new tools were coming up in the container-first world of k8s and structured logging.  I believe it was also the case that very large companies were running into operational constraints with ES, due to its fundamental design as a document database.  While excellent at full-text search, at petabyte scale and beyond many industry leaders started looking to columnar / OLAP solutions such as ClickHouse or metadata-only indexing such as Loki.  ES/OpenSearch is still relevant and widely used, so I don’t think it’s bad to learn at all, but most of the people building their own stack today might choose something else (LGTM stack), and the larger enterprise tends to favor fully managed solutions like AWS OpenSearch or Splunk in my experience.",

As others have pointed out the LGTM or SigNoz approach is the new hotness that a lot of folks are moving to especially if you're trying to save money over shipping logs to DataDog or NewRelic.  \n\nThe biggest problem (in my opinion) with ELK is that Kibana is kind of terrible and has a fairly steep learning curve and what takes seconds to do in DataDog or Grafana takes much deeper knowledge of what you are trying to accomplish in Kibana.  Loki is pretty great at 'spray and pray' when it comes to log aggregation and datatyping where Logstash/Elastic you have to be very deliberate and intentional about field mappings.  \n\nThis might be a somewhat spicy opinion but I think that Elastic kicks the crap out of pretty much everyone if you are doing more advanced things other than a pretty way to grep syslog.  If you're using logs for basically just troubleshooting pretty much every option listed in this thread is a better option.  If you're using logs as a source of data, doing ML jobs for deep analysis, or using Elastic as a vector database it is one of the best tools around for it.  The security/SIEM tooling is fantastic.",

I remember our junior engineers would get frustrated trying to build dashboards that would take 5 minutes in Grafana. But once you get past that initial hump, you can do some pretty sophisticated stuff - we had it doing real-time risk scoring on user behavior patterns that would've cost us 10x more with a commercial SIEM.

Contractors, accountants, devs jumping in to help, sometimes even temporary automation. Rotating everything constantly is not realistic, but keeping things as they are feels irresponsible.\nI am looking for recommendations on better ways to handle this. Ideally something where access can be granted without exposing credentials and can be revoked instantly without breaking everything else. How are others solving this after a scare like this?",

          "text": ">Rotating everything constantly is not realistic\n\nWhen you say \"not realistic\", what you actually mean is \"too much effort\".\n\nUltimately this all comes down to hygiene and process:\n\n1. Shared access to anything should be removed wherever possible. Every dev gets their own credentials to everything. Why are you using shared API keys? Everyone gets their own. \n\n2. Where shared access is absolutely unavoidable, then the scope must be limited and access-controlled wherever possible. Password managers, or JIT logins, etc. Having a single password vault which everyone can access is only slightly better than having a shared document with everything written on it.\n\n3. Credentials used by systems must be secured/encrypted. Devs cannot be using the API key that the finance service uses to talk to the mailing service, or logging into the database with the authentication service's password. Every service has its own credentials, stored securely and not visible to anyone who does not have direct access to the machine running the service. \n\n4. Have a rock-solid onboarding and offboarding process, automated and cross-checked as much as possible to ensure that credentials are created and deleted appropriately. If devs get access to systems by asking their teammates to create credentials, then you're in trouble.\n\n5. Rotate credentials. This only difficult when you never designed your systems to accomodate it. But once you do it the first time, you now know how to do it. Doing it automatically then becomes easy.\n\n6. Audit. Create scripts and dashboards to scan logs and databases looking for new logins by old keys, sending emails to remind you (and everyone else) that their keys need to be rotated, automatically disabling old keys, looking for usage of credetnials belonging to former employees, etc, etc. This is the one I used to hate because a regular old script which connects to a DB, searches records, parses all the data, formats it, and sends emails, is easy but boring as hell. It's a day's work that you don't wanna do. LLMs spit it out for me in an hour.",

So when we need to give access to a key to someone, what we actually do is fork the dev config, generate new tokens just for their config, and then the doppler runtime wrapper automatically loads their keys at runtime instead of the main dev config. We configured it so they can get a short-lived access token to obtain their keys. They have to refresh the token daily to maintain access, and we can destroy the forked dev config at any time.\n\nOn our side, we are generating keys and forking configs.

If our user’s account was blocked, all keys given out to that user were canceled. For very short term contractors, they used their own OAuth source, eg. their work account or personal email account, and we could cancel their keys in the app. Long term contractors got an account in our 365.\n\nKeys given to people were always temporary, and all of them would auto-expire. They were also revocable in our app. So any dev could cancel a key they got handed out but didn’t need anymore.\n\nKeys given to automation were issued as secrets directly to the GitHub account. Most of the time at least. Then, the dev never saw them nor had to copy-paste them anywhere. If a dev needed a key for access from their desktop IDE or scripts, they could get one via the app, but that was on the rarer side.\n\nThe app had templates for commonly needed sets of keys. So if something needed 5 different API keys, they could be issued as a bundle, and canceled/revoked as a bundle.\n\nPutting API keys issued from the app in chats or anything like that was not allowed. For our teams and slack we added automation that detected valid API keys in posts and anonymized them.\n\nWe generally did not allow keys from 3rd parties that couldn’t be revoked at least in a semi-automated way. If someone was giving us a demo key, we could put it in the app together with the email of the issuer. If the app needed to revoke the key, it’d shoot an email to the issuer and open a case so someone had to follow up on it. A vendor or two gave us self-revocable demo/evaluation keys that you could revoke via their api. We would add those api calls to the app so it was automated.\n\nIn general, our mantra was that every key was handed out by the app to a person, and we had a current inventory of any valid (non-revoked) keys issued to any person and/or repository.\n\nThis was on the dev/test side of things. Prod had its own key issuance api. There too we could cancel any and all keys deployed, and had an inventory.\n\nI got the MVP for that app written over a couple of weekends and then others took up maintenance/enhancements. It was a lifesaver several times. And we weren’t a big company either, less than 50 people.",

          "text": "> Rotating everything constantly is not realistic, but keeping things as they are feels irresponsible.\n\nIt really depends.\n\nWe are giving some external consultants access to parts of our infra.\n\nI did create a dedicated aws sub-account for external users, and users from there can assume a privileged role in the real aws account IF AND ONLY IF they tag their session with their username (and make the assume-role api call via https).\n\nThat way credentials are 1. always automatically obtained and renewed (through assume-role) and 2. always short-lived (if leaked, they will expire within 1h or something like that).\n\n> Ideally something where access can be granted without exposing credentials and can be revoked instantly without breaking everything else\n\nIt really depends on the service. Some services have this features built-in (think AWS' assume-role) some will never have it (think some random ftp server).\n\nTangentially: one of the things I have on my todo list and will be pushing for is fido/u2f security keys (think yubikey). If I can manage to bridge AWS with Google Workspace for authentication and force more services to login via google (either directly or through keycloak) that should be fixed.\n\nThat being said: api keys should always have an expiration that's machine readable (in the sense that when you load the key, the library should be able to emit a warning about the api key expiring in like ~30 days or whatever). This should either be part of the key (think jwt tokens) or part of the API you're consuming (this of course makes sense if you are the one emitting the api key and receiving requests - in this case you should have an endpoint to check for api key validity).\n\n\nOne more sidenote: IIRC stackoverflow had a policy that if an api key was sent to some endpoint in plaintext (http rather than https) then the key was assumed to be compromised as it had traveled over an insecure channel and immediately invalidated. The user had then to provision a new api key and MAKE SURE to only call api endpoints over https.",

I needed something live, and I’ve used AI to crank out placeholder copy + structure while I’m juggling work/life and building it out. I’m slowly replacing it with more real stuff as I go.\n\nThe podcast… the audio is not AI generated. I write my own notes, record it myself, and edit it. For the weekly news episodes, the inputs are basically what you’d expect… SRE Weekly, TLDR DevOps, AWS blogs, vendor release notes, random stuff I run into at work. It’s a human-curated recap, not a robot reading scraped articles. Interviews are just real 1:1 conversations with people I reach out to (or who reach out to me).\n\nThe bigger risk isn’t “using AI”, it’s pretending you didn’t and putting out generic fluff IMO.\n\nOn the job prospects point… I don’t think having AI-assisted content hurts you unless it makes you look inauthentic or sloppy. If you’re a senior DevOps person with 10+ years, your credibility comes from your real opinions, war stories, and how you think through problems. AI can help with the boring parts (thumbnails, show notes formatting, site scaffolding). It shouldn’t be the “voice”.\n\nAlso, the show has been doing fine. Ship It Weekly hit Apple Podcasts Top 10 in the US “Tech News” list recently, which tells me listeners care more about signal than the tooling used to package it:\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/grouping/tech-news/196859\n\nIf you’re thinking of doing something similar, I’d say go for it, but keep it simple. If you want, tell me what format you’re considering (news, interviews, study sessions, etc.) and I’ll give you some recs. I’d also be open to assistance if you’d want to help with Ship It Weekly.",

Yes, the tools are a bit too much and i see it growing more as there is good amout of money to make inthis field and commercial players are eyei g for it, but they should not define a good DevOps engineer as the concept should be well understood and practirlced over time to be better and senior at job not the tool syntax itself. My approach: The tool that the majority of team member knows gets used is the first step, and then as company and team grow, industry standards and popular tools should be preferred as they make hiring easier.",

          "text": "hey. 15 years of automation experience starting from Selenium Core and all the way through to Playwright. Now a DevOps. \n\nAs others said - there's multiple issues. First and most important is leadership/managerial. If you have time to slow down a bit, investigate and improve - good. Count this almost solved. If the speed of development will grow - it's almost a lost cause. \n\nSecond is budget. I have multiple experiences when parallelising causes flakiness. Test infra simply doesn't cope and often there's no monitoring to see this. Look for DB connection pool exhaustion, look for DB load, look for compute and memory resources. A few years ago we hit a very painful wall. We had to significantly increase compute for TEST DB server. There's 20 people working there (testers, devs, analysts) and 25 test runners. That's on par with average production user count at the time. This costs money and escalates quickly. We also had to clean up the DB continuously.\n\nThird, platform settings. Once we sort DB issues out, we hit an obscure ingress/nginx/cdn issue which caused some requests to fail. Found similar issue by accident on Nginx github and found which config was stupidly low. We hit this only by running 25 tests in parallel and hit a connection limit. \n\nFourth, smart tests. A lot depends on testability of the system and often you can't change it. Aim at smaller tests, but do connect them in logical dependencies. Often an antipattern... but hey, most likely all system under tests is a book of antipatterns. Aim at test re-runs by the test runner framework. Find flaky places and add retries around them. Replace shitty form submission with REST calls to same API. \n\nFifth and last, prioritise and \"quarantine\" flaky tests. Move them to a parallel pipeline that won't block the release. Take a look at failures as they come. Fix if needed. Obviously this relates to secondary functionality that is not critical and/or not used frequently. \n\ngood luck 👋",

          "text": "You have two separate problems to solve.\n\nFirstly, flakiness. Tests should never be flaky. You need to diagnose why they are flaky. This means you have something non-deterministic in your tests. You need to isolate what the root cause for each failure is and figure out where the non-determinism is coming from. \n\nI spent a bunch of effort improving the reliability of tests for my UI team because it was causing a massive productivity loss and general unhappiness within the team. Issues we'd been living with for a very long time. You'll be amazed what a couple of people taking a week to focus on it can achieve. Our pipeline now almost never fails outside of a genuine issue. Some things were very simple like adding a script which waits for the server to have finished bundling properly before Cypress tests start. Some things were more complex like adding a wrapper which fails any test which attempts to access an external resource so we could identify where mocks had been missed. A final thing was moving all the pipeline jobs to be container based so we had more reliable compute resource and configuration.\n\nSecondly, you have performance. There's no reason tests should be slow. \n\nI don't have much experience with UI testing, but common mistakes I've seen countless times on backend software is using sleep operations to advance time. They're unreliable and slow, and often are both more reliable and faster if you have a mock clock you can advance and semaphores to handle multi-threaded conditions. On the UI side you can also get a handle on things like timers and manually advance them by specific time increments to assert behaviours. \n\nStart with your slowest test and identify where the time is being spent. You'll probably find patterns that apply to many more tests. \n\nParallelism is a good final step, but it's worth ironing out any big test performance issues before just making it parallel. You want the tests to be fast so developers can run them quickly and easily without having to wait for the pipeline to tell them they broke something. \n\nInvestment in test stability and performance easily pays itself off, especially when you have a decent sized team and you're already losing lots of time to it. \n\nFrom a prioritisation point of view, it's one of the non-discretionary jobs in my mind. We don't ask the business for permission to do this kind of work, we just do it. I will pad out how long other features are going to take to deliver, or push back start dates on features, to make the time for these tasks.",

I dont want to consider breaking process every time I deploy. When I submit a PR its not taking as much mental load to rerun tests.  \n  \nBut it depends a bit about the amount of throughput, number of open PRs and # of engineers on the project. You might run these tests an order of magnitude more times if they are on the PR and not on merge if you have a big backlog of PRs to merge. But maybe you have a backlog of PRs to merge because merging is the bottleneck?\n\nGenerally though, this is why QA has been phased out at a lot of places.

When you're seeing failures every run that move around, it's usually not \"selectors are flawed\" so much as the system (tests, env, pipeline) isn't deterministic yet, and the suite has become an untrustworthy gate. \n\nIf it helps, here's some steps that might help get signal and apply fixes:\n\nWhat do the failures look like?\n- are they timeout, stale elements, element not found, assert mismatches, navigation, 5xx/network, browser crashes?\n- do they cluster around particular areas (login, search, checkout etc.) or are they truly random? \n- is there correlation with parallelism level, runner type, time of day or specific envs? \n\nHow deterministic is the state/data?\n- are tests sharing users/data? Or does each test have its own data and cleanup? \n- are you setting a state via API/setup hooks (fast, consistent), or driving everything through the UI (slow, fragile)?\n\nHow stable is the environment/ infrastructure?\n- shared ling lived environment vs isolation per run?\n- real external dependencies involved (auth/email/payments) vs stubs?\n- any signs of runner starvation (CPU/memory) or environment bottlenecks?\n\n\nAnd what you can do with the answers:\n1. Add a tiny bit of observability to the suite\n    - start tagging failures with a simple reason code: timing/wait, data collision, env instability, infra starvation, selectors/DOM, real bug.\n    - track two numbers per test: flake rare and runtime contribution\n    - you'll usually find a small set of tests/ specs causing a disproportionate chunk of pain\n\n2. Fix the gate design (so you stop paying the full cost on every PR):\n    - 650 tests (on every PR)some/ most/ all being ui e2e is effectively saying \"everything is critical\"\n    - should split these into tiers:\n      - PR gate: fast checks and a small UI smoke/ critical path subset\n      - broader e2e: larger critical set and the full regression in a separate lane.\n    - add a quarantine policy: flaky tests don't block merges, but stay visible and owned. Otherwise \"rerun-to-green\" becomes the workflow.\n\n3. Attack the usual flake sources:\n    - data isolation: unique data per test/ run, avoid shared accounts, make setup/teardown idempotent.\n    - deterministic synchronisation: remove sleeps, wait for the app states/events, assert in stable states. \n    - reduce shared environment interference: minimise cross-test coupling, stabalise/stub the most unreliable external does where it's appropriate\n\n4. treat speed separately from reliability:\n    - once the above is under control, you can revisit the speed (sharing, controlled parallelism, better runners).\n    - if you ever consider swapping tooling for speed/ ergonomics, it can help, but it's best treated as an investment decision AFTER you've nailed whether flake is env/data/infra vs test code.\n\nI'm also of the opinion (and I know it's not always shared) that retries aren't the best solution - a single retry can be a temporary mitigation for known transient infra hiccups, but if reruns are the normal path to green, it teaches everyone to ignore red builds. \n\nIf you're able to share one or two representative failure tipes (timeout vs stale element vs assertion vs network), it's usually possible to tell pretty quickly whether you're looking at data/env/infra instability or test design issues\n\n\nAs a side note: screw writing things this long on the mobile app again 😂😭",

Not being able to trust a test is more harmfull than no test at all.    \n- Have test filters. Eg. Tests that are run for every PR and test that are run several times a day. Dotr slow down developers.        \n- Have dedicated hardware / cloud runners. We had 15 VM machines running tests in parallel. Also using browserstack etc to test different browsers.    \n- Have good test reports / reproduceability for developers to fix bugs afterwards. I built own test framework that \"marked\" / coloured clicked / selected elements and removed color on next click. Made it clear whhat was selected and if something wrong was selected.      \n- Bonus to prior. Have code coverage tool if posible. Being able to see what code is hit by what tests also help narrow down bug fixing.        \n- Use best practice / patterns builting E2E tests. This greatly reduce flakiness and make tests easier to fix when UI changes. Eg PageObject design pattern and others.       \n- Dont be afraid to delete tests.      \n- Remeber to built your UI to being easy to test. Eg. Giving your components component Id. Eg: <div data-id=\"dialog-box\" ....> .. </div>. This will give E2E test a great way to reach root of a component and .innerText() or whatever is needed.     \n\nThis is just whats top of my mind.

Improve CI/CD skills. Handle on-call duties confidently. Each step had clear signals that you were \"leveling up.\" But the longer I've been in this industry, the weaker those signals have become.\n\nMost of my growth now comes from ambiguous situations. Design reviews with unclear requirements. Stakeholders changing priorities mid-quarter. Post-mortems where no individual mistakes yet the system still crashed. These moments force you to articulate the reasons behind your choices. \n\nThis is also where AI is starting to appear in my workflow; I use it to help me with reviews.Because more and more situations aren't simply solved by mastering a skill. It ultimately comes down to soft skills. I'm becoming the kind of manager I used to dislike, haha. I interact with more people than I use tools every day. I'm currently preparing for a job change, and I've noticed my preparation process is different this time. While I still use resources like Indeed or IQB interview question banks and  GPT or Beyz coding assistant for mock interviews, the goal this time is to slow down and make my reasoning process clearer. AI can speed up execution, but I feel that senior engineers need slower, clearer thinking for growth. This isn't something that can be easily quantified by how many problems you've solved or how many projects you've led. Even the feedback is much more ambiguous than learning a new tool.\n\nI'm still unsure what the \"correct\" learning path looks like at this stage. It feels like becoming a sponge absorbing and disseminating information. The influencing factors and things to balance have become much more numerous than before. Where are the boundaries of this career development/promotion title? I recently saw an interesting analogy: we are a collection of cells constantly controlling the influx and efflux of new and old matter. So how do we determine \"new\" and \"old\" in our growth?",

One of those is providing audit logs, but enabling slow query log for every query(i.e. log\\_min\\_duration\\_statement=0) is not recommended for production databases and pgAudit seems to be consuming too much I/O.\n\nI'm writing a simple proxy which will pass all authentication and other setup and then parse every message and log all queries. Since the proxy is stateless it is easy to scale it and it doesn't eat the precious resources of the primary database. The parsing/logging is happening asynchronously from the proxying\n\nSo far it is working good, I still need to hammer it with more load tests and do some edge case testing (e.g. behavior when the database is extremely slow). I wrote the same thing for MySQL with the idea to open-sourcing it.\n\nI'm not sure if other people will be interested in utilizing such proxy, so here I am asking about your opinion.\n\nEdit: Grammar",

      "text": "Hello, all. [Luxury Yacht](https://github.com/luxury-yacht/app) is a desktop app for managing Kubernetes clusters that I've been working on for the past few months. It's available for macOS, Windows, and Linux. It's built with [Wails v2](https://wails.io/). Huge thanks to Lea Anthony for that awesome project. Can't wait for Wails v3.\n\nThis originally started as a personal project that I didn't intend to release. I know there are a number of other good apps in this space, but none of them work quite the way I want them to, so I decided to build one. Along the way it got good enough that I thought others might enjoy using it.\n\nLuxury Yacht is FOSS, and I have no intention of ever charging money for it. It's been a labor of love, a great learning opportunity, and an attempt to try to give something back to the FOSS community that has given me so much.\n\nIf you want to get a sense of what it can do without downloading and installing it, [read the primer](https://github.com/luxury-yacht/app/blob/main/docs/primer.md). Or, head to the [Releases](https://github.com/luxury-yacht/app/releases) page to download the latest release.\n\nOh, a quick note about the name. I wanted something that was fun and invoked the nautical theme of Kubernetes, but I didn't want yet another \"K\" name. A conversation with a friend led me to the name \"Luxury Yacht\", and I warmed up to it pretty quickly. It's goofy but I like it. Plus, it has a Monty Python connection, which makes me happy.",

I've got a few laptops that I run it on. I've got a pretty new M4 Max MBP, an M1 Pro MBP (running Asahi Linux), and a 5-year-old System 76 Gazelle. It seems to run pretty well on the older stuff. I've used it with some fairly large EKS clusters (1000-ish pods) courtesy of my day job, and it seems to do well on those. But truth is there are a lot of possible configs out there it's never seen. I'll be interested to see what kinds of results people get when it gets some wider usage.",

Things you need to recall but don't use every day.\n\n**Vision/roadmap documents** \\- Writing down multi-year plans helps the team align on direction. Everyone reads the same thing instead of having different interpretations from meetings.\n\nBut detailed how-to guides or step-by-step procedures?

Having worked at startups in SI Valley as a dev and in ops I would recommend a different approach.  Startups are working on their next round of financing and have to show immediate progress or the doors will close.  So first off realize you are optimizing for speed and change - I’ve seen startups completely change what product they were offering/making overnight.  So find out what devs are feeling pain over, what is stopping them from changing direction, what is wasting their time - really listen and think deeply. And fix that with automation, changes in process, tooling, and sometimes helping out manually if needed.   Sometimes the best thing you can do is the wrong thing long term.  It won’t matter if the doors close. \n\nI expect to be downvoted. But I stand by this. I’ve worked in fortune 20 companies in devops - startups are a whole different animal.",

One of the players is a saboteur whose goal is to take things down. The rest of the team has to keep production alive and figure out who’s causing the incidents.\n\nThe problem: I’m not a real DevOps engineer. I’m a developer who ends up doing DevOps because the companies I work for are too cheap to hire one. So while I know some pain, I’m very aware I probably don’t know half of it.\n\nFor now, each round spawns a fresh Ubuntu container that represents the company’s main machine. Every player gets a Linux user on that machine. One player is the “manager” with sudo access and decides who gets elevated privileges and when. The system starts in a working state: applications are already running under a process manager (currently PM2), nginx or Apache is preconfigured (based on player choice), DNS is set up, and there’s a mocked certbot-like setup handling SSL. \n\nFor now there are three possible initial system states:\n\n• **“Setup by DevOps”** – everything is where it’s supposed to be (assuming I didn’t mess anything up).  \n• **“Setup by children”** – things mostly work, but there are some mistakes.  \n• **“Setup by a frontend dev”** – everything runs as sudo and nothing is where it’s supposed to be.\n\nThe game features a in game terminal, browser and some unimportant other apps. The player can interact wiht the pages via the ingame browser and with the machine via the ingame terminal or any terminal and ssh to the container.\n\nNow i am at the stage where i need to make tasks, like \"the company changed its name, the website should no longer be [www.company.com](http://www.company.com) but www.newcompany.com\" and the playes should buy the domain (mocked providers), setup the nameservers and dns records and then nginx. Or change the port of the xBackendService to whatever.\n\nAnd this is where I’d really appreciate some help: without making it too daunting or frustrating, and while keeping things balanced for both teams, what other DevOps pain points should I add to keep the authenticity, while still making it somewhat fun? (it's a simulation after all and making it really fun would break the immersion i guess)? \n\nPS: i am not trying to advertise this as i am pretty sure it will never go to market. I'm a nerd and  just enjoy building interesting things for myself, and this turned out to be surprisingly fun to work on.",

Recently, I've been building my own SaaS and micro-SaaS projects using Go (backend) and Angular. It's been a great learning experience, but I’ve noticed that my backends occasionally fail—nothing catastrophic, just small hiccups, occasional 500 errors, or brief downtime.\n\nMy current setup is as basic as it gets: a single VPS running nginx as a reverse proxy, with a systemd service running my Go executable. It works fine for now, but I'm expecting user growth and want to be prepared for hundreds of thousands of users.\n\nMy question is: once you’ve outgrown this simple setup, what’s the logical next step to scale without overcomplicating things? I’m not looking to jump straight into Kubernetes or a full-blown microservices architecture just yet, but I do need something more resilient and scalable than a single point of failure.\n\nWhat would you recommend? I’d love to hear about your experiences and any straightforward, incremental improvements you’ve made to scale your Go applications.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Running 2–3 identical Go instances behind nginx or a managed load balancer gets you a surprising amount of resilience for very little complexity.\n\nAfter that, make failures cheap. Good health checks, fast restarts, and moving state out of the instance (DB, Redis, object storage) matter more than orchestration early on.\n\nI’ve seen teams go very far with “boring” infra once those basics are solid.

Git, folder structure, CODEOWNERS, and PR reviews are table stakes. They solve versioning, access control, and collaboration. They do **not** solve the problem I described.\n\nThe issue I’m asking about is **maintainability at scale**:\n\n* Scripts that start as quick fixes and gradually accrete logic\n* Copy-paste reuse *within* the same repo\n* No clear boundary between “one-off script” and “shared automation”\n* Inconsistent parameters, error handling, logging, and behavior\n* Scripts growing into de facto tools without tests, contracts, or ownership clarity\n\nYou can have all of this **inside a single, well-organized Git repo**.\n\nSo when someone says “just don’t duplicate scripts” or “just put them in Git,” that doesn’t address the core problem. Duplication and entropy don’t happen because Git is missing; they happen because there are no enforced engineering constraints.\n\nWhat I was hoping to hear about are *practices that actually stop entropy*, for example:\n\n* When teams decide a script must become a module\n* How shared logic is enforced (private modules, internal feeds, etc.)\n* CI gates (PSScriptAnalyzer, Pester, style rules)\n* Script lifecycle policies (experimental vs supported vs deprecated)\n* Thresholds where PowerShell is no longer the right abstraction\n* How teams prevent “ops glue” from turning into untestable production code\n\nIf your experience is “we solved this by using Git,” then respectfully, that means you likely haven’t experienced the failure mode I’m describing yet.\n\nI’m interested in answers from environments where PowerShell has lived for years, crossed team boundaries, and accumulated real operational risk and what actually worked (or didn’t) to keep it sane.",

          "text": "Confluence and other wiki-style applications is what I see most nowadays. I've definitely seen SOPs in Word (yes I'm *that* old, in IT terms), but those tend to be way more outdated.\n\nIn the end what you pointed out about rotting over time is true no matter where you do it, though a Word type format is more likely to not get any attention in my experience.\n\nIf you need SOPs/Runbooks you should:\n\n* Make sure you have them for stuff that actually qualifies. Which from my experience are either something that happens frequently and you want many people to be able to do (specific hygiene tasks for a Dev team for example), or something that has such high impact that not being able to do it at any time will cause significant loss (in revenue) (like recovery from some specific form of outage)\n* And secondly, make sure that budget is allocated for people to maintain the SOPs/Runbooks.\n\nFar too often I see well intentioned people make runbooks for stuff that's incredibly obvious and/or best/common practice. Or things that are so nuanced that it makes no sense as a runbook. Kind of the \"let's document everything anyone could ever do\" mindset, which gives you way too much stuff and most of it never gets used, not to mention: is outdated the moment it's written down since it's too detailed and covers far too much. The other thing I see a lot is that Runbook/SOP creation is seen as a side-task for someone. \"Let's have the developers write it and then the ops team maintain it (whenever they have a moment)\" and in then end these things are 1 written poorly and 2 never updated because people are always busy fixing stuff.\n\nUsually it's a combination of all of the above: no one owns the making and maintaining of this stuff and it gets generated as an unimportant aside.\n\nPersonally I am not convinced of the criticality of runbooks/SOPs in all situations. Like I said I think they need to have significant value AND cover things in a way that doesn't make it outdated basically instantly. If those things are true then there is some incentive to dedicate budget to writing and maintaining them, which needs to be something constant as well. Otherwise, honestly, just using Google and ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini/whatever in a pinch will probably get you out of trouble just the same.",

A well staffed platform team would do this by implementing the operator pattern but with fewer resources this can be at least tacked onto an alerting system: alert detecting condition triggers -> task implementing runbook executes. That at least lets you write tests for the runbook logic, although it’s more brittle than the operator pattern.\n\nOn alerts generally: you never want to be in a place where an alert fires and you know exactly what to do. Alerts should detect unusual situations that require human intervention. If alerts are regularly handled by following rote remediation steps, you need to prioritize fixing the root cause. Of course the real world is messy and this isn’t always practical, but that’s the ideal.",

I did intern with my team before, so I knew what to expect going in.\n\nDuring my internship, I felt so incredibly confused the entire time. During the time between my internship and starting full time, I did some personal projects and filled in some gaps with containerization and other things.\n\nNow that I am full time, I feel like I somewhat know what I'm doing, but I think what gets me is that my team is able to come up with new things to automate, find gaps in things that I don't see, and come up with better solutions with new technologies. I work for a good company, and my team is really smart, so I know if they are willing to have me, I must be okay.\n\nI think what gets me sometimes is the vast amount of knowledge about tons of different things being in DevOps, and not having much of a background in anything else. There is so much to learn - and only over the past few months have I REALLY worked with RHEL, containerization, CI/CD, AWS, and of course our systems we have created. This, and sometimes I get so invested in the tasks themselves, that I can look over small details in PRs, or forgetting to keep up with putting in progress/closing out my Jira stories.\n\nMy team is also extremely organized, and although I find myself to be a very organized person, I feel like I make so many small mistakes during my work. I know I'm only a few months in, but things still take me time and even then, there are so many comments on my PRs. I want to be really good at this, and I really do enjoy it.\n\nIf anyone has any tips as far as organization, dealing with imposter syndrome in this field, and/or gaining confidence in my skills and knowledge, I would love to hear it.\n\nThank you!\n\nEdit: My team is also remote, but they are seemingly very nice despite not getting to know them very well yet.

With the amount of information out there it’s honestly overwhelming, and I sometimes wonder if I’m starting too late.\n\nBackground-wise, I studied Computer Science at university and did some freelance web development, though I wouldn’t call myself a strong coder. I can still build things and I’m familiar with Python and JavaScript, along with common frameworks (not heavy on algorithms). I recently passed the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam and I’m now studying for the Solutions Architect Associate. I’ve also learned Docker, GitHub Actions, and have hands-on exposure to cloud and tooling.\n\nI feel like I’m doing bits of everything and not sure if I’m on the right path. Given my background, I’d really appreciate advice on what I should focus on first, what to strengthen, and how to move forward toward a solid DevOps role.",

      "text": "Remember when bots were just annoying? Googlebot, Bingbot, maybe some sketchy SEO crawlers. You'd throw a robots.txt at them and call it a day.\n\nThose days are gone.\n\nNow it's OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, ByteDance, and god knows how many \"AI agents\" that everyone's suddenly obsessed with. They don't care about robots.txt. They don't care about your bandwidth. They don't care that your home $2/month VPS is getting hammered 24/7 by scrapers training models worth billions.\n\nThese companies are scraping content to build AI that will eventually replace the people who created that content. We're literally feeding the machine that's coming for us.\n\nSo I built a SHA256 proof-of-work challenge system for Nginx/Openresty. Nothing like Anubis, yet still effective.\n\n[https://github.com/terem42/pow-ddos-challenge/](https://github.com/terem42/pow-ddos-challenge/)\n\nHere's the idea:\n\nEvery new visitor solves a small computational puzzle before accessing content\n\nReal browsers with real humans? Barely noticeable — takes <1 second\n\nScrapers hitting you at scale? Now they need to burn CPU for every single request\n\nAt difficulty 5, each request costs \\~2 seconds of compute time\n\nWant to scrape 1 million pages? That'll be \\~$2,000 in compute costs. Have fun.\n\nThe beauty is the economics flip. Instead of YOU paying for their requests, THEY pay for their requests. With their own electricity. Their own CPU cycles.\n\nYes, if a scraper solves one challenge and saves the cookie, they get a free pass for the session duration. That's why I recommend shorter sessions (POW\\_EXPIRE=3600) for sensitive APIs.\n\nThe economics still work: they need to solve PoW once per IP per session. A botnet with 10,000 IPs still needs 10,000 PoW solutions. It's not perfect, but it's about making scale expensive, not impossible.\n\nIt won't stop a determined attacker with deep pockets. Nothing will. But it makes mass scraping economically stupid. And that's really all we can ask for.",

You will drain battery life from mobile clients.\n\nYou are testing if the requester is a bot / human - and you are giving the requester a challenge for which a bot is way better than the human? That doesnt make sense to me - rather use a regular captcha (which i know can be also solved but way more costly)\n\nI do have to add that captchas are getting quite hard - i needed like 5 mins on X to create an account with their captchas which are way harder than the old google recaptcha stuff",

          "text": "\\> given the massive amount of drift we have\n\nThis sounds like a bit of a mess in itself, but setting it aside for a moment...\n\nIn theory the answer to your question is yes, but in practice it probably depends on how complex your CDKTF code is and what you're deploying with it. Looking at the archived CDKTF repo, there are quite a few synth-related issues still open, so there's a chance the synth to HCL could go awry: [https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20synth](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20synth)\n\nProbably easy enough to test that with a \\`synth\\` and a \\`terraform plan\\`, though, I'd imagine. Have you tried that yet?\n\n\\> Am I correct in understanding that with cdktf synth —hcl that we can continue to use the existing state files without importing all our resources manually, or is that incorrect?\n\nAgain, in theory yes, because the state files represent what the Terraform CLI did with the synthesized JSON, not the synthesized JSON (or HCL) itself. If the synth produces the right HCL, you should be able to run \\`terraform plan\\` and then \\`apply\\` with it and the state files will remain unchanged. And then once you synth to HCL, assuming the HCL is correct, you should be able to use the \\`terraform\\` CLI with the same state files from that point forward.\n\nThat said, the generated HCL almost surely won't be as good/clear/idiomatic as what a human or LLM would write, and any logic or higher-level constructs you've written in C# will likely be lost in translation. So while the HCL escape hatch is nice to have, you'll almost surely want the help of an LLM to refactor it. Lean on \\`plan\\` as you iterate with Claude (or whatever) and you should be fine, though. Then you can take on the drift issue with \\`refresh\\`. :)\n\nAll this said, I'm curious as to why you aren't looking to something like Pulumi instead, in order to keep using C#. Full disclosure, I work for Pulumi, but I'm not here to push that — I'm more interested in hearing why falling back to HCL seems like a better idea than forging ahead with C# (which Pulumi would enable you to do [in various ways](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/cdktf-is-deprecated-whats-next-for-your-team/)). From your drift comment, sounds like maybe your team didn't fully adopt it?",
