      "text": "I just walked out of an interview where I was grilled on specific flags for `tar` and obscure `kubectl` syntax. It’s incredibly frustrating because, in the real world, I would just check the `man` page or the docs in five seconds. I’ve architected scalable clusters and debugged complex race conditions at 3 AM, but apparently, none of that matters if I don't have the documentation memorized. It feels like we are being tested on our ability to be a dictionary rather than our ability to be engineers who solve problems.\n\nI wish more interviewers would actually test how I think. Ask me how I’d debug a 500 error on a Friday night or how I’d design a rollback strategy; don't ask me for a flag I’ve aliased in my `.bashrc` for three years.\n\nWhat is the most ridiculous \"trivia\" question you've ever been asked that had absolutely nothing to do with your actual ability to do the job?\n\nFor candidates who want to prepare beyond command-line trivia, this breakdown on real-world [DevOps interview questions](https://www.netcomlearning.com/blog/devops-interview-questions) highlights the skills employers should actually be evaluating.  \n",

Communicating that you understand the fundamental concepts and available tools which can do a job for you is more important than understanding that you can Google stuff and save what you found on stack overflow in an alias.\n\nAddressing OP's stated circumstance, an interviewer asking for specific flags is coming at it the wrong way. They should be asking about process and determining whether you have the core knowledge required instead of specifics and minutiae like flags. But some interviews are going to be shitty. When they are, pivoting directly to process is a better answer than just \"I use aliases\" and waiting for the interviewer to prompt you for more info.",

So they default to memorization.\n\nAlso, if that’s how they interview, that’s probably how they operate. Lots of gatekeeping, not a lot of engineering.\n\nOnly time CLI stuff makes sense is junior-ish and even then it should be fundamentals, not trivia. Like… explain stdin/stdout/stderr, pipes, exit codes, basic text processing, and how you’d find the answer when you don’t know. That’s way more realistic than “what’s the 3rd flag on tar I haven’t used since 2014.”\n\nRidiculous one I got once… “recite the exact rsync flags to do a dry run with delete and preserve perms” …as if `--help` doesn’t exist.",

That was a great fundamental interview question by the way.\n\n>Thank you again for your time,\"\n\nand I was surprised to actually get the job. However, even though I had rubbed him the wrong way in the interview somehow, the reason I took the job is that I felt I would work well with the Director. He left shortly after I joined, and I didn't get along AT ALL with his replacement; he let me go shortly after joining. It was an open office anyway and they had put the engineering/ops team in between sales and marketing so in between the sales bros and the marketing ladies it was a kind of loud environment that I was frankly not suited for anyway. I do better in a quiet environment surrounded by developers or engineers, or working remotely so I wasn't unhappy to move on. There were some kind of strange personalities in that place.

      "text": "For years, my career was purely focused on on-prem infrastructure, mainly in Linux-based roles. I spent my days configuring OSs with Ansible and deploying them with Terraform using on-prem providers like vSphere and Proxmox. We hosted everything ourselves, and I really loved the feeling of actually *owning* those workloads.\n\nA few months ago, I took a new job at a company that helps migrate workloads to the Big 3 cloud providers... and I kind of hate it.\n\nI’m the type of person who likes to own my things in my personal life, and I’m realizing that applies to my professional life, too. On top of that, my current employer is heavily invested in a the well known Office suite ecosystem, which just doesn't align with my values—especially as an EU citizen paying attention to the current geopolitical climate.\n\nI know the obvious advice is *\"just switch jobs,\"* and I am actively looking. But it's tough when \"the cloud\" is practically a mandatory requirement on every job posting these days. I read this [blog post](https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-we-re-leaving-the-cloud-654b47e0) which is already 3 years old that give me hope for the future of on-prem\n\nI understand the business value of the cloud, but from a technical and ethical standpoint, my heart is still with on-prem. Has anyone else felt this way?",

In the cloud, it can feel like you’re just stitching together managed services and hoping the billing dashboard doesn’t explode.\n\nThat said, the market reality is what it is. Cloud isn’t going away but neither is on-prem. It’s just shifting. Regulated industries, edge workloads, hybrid setups, sovereignty concerns (especially in the EU), those are very real drivers for keeping things close to home.",

Not because i like wasting money (even if it isnt my own) but because everything you do suddenly has to be budgetted for that year and everything costs money. At least, that is how it goes in my company. If I want to test something and it costs money, i'll get questions about it if that cost goes up to much. And every year we get a reminder that cloud costs are not supposed to go up and we should do everything to lower them.\n\nWe have both cloud and on-prem in the company i work for, and i like on-prem a lot more. With on prem i just use an old server for some tests, which doesnt cost anything. Right now im testing a log solution, just powered on three spare servers, installed it and put in a few TB of logs to see how it handles in real life",

No more waiting for weeks for that new capacity or spending time finding good VARs. Just spin up what you need in 30 seconds and move on.\n\nFor truly scalable or fluctuating workloads cloud can often be cheaper as well. But these situations are rare, and often people think they have this when they don't. It also requires you to go full \"cloud native\" with things like serverless.\n\nBoth are fine honestly, and I'd hate to work with the wrong one for the situation.

I am also tired of everything being a subscription and feeling like I’m constantly renting my own work.

IaaS is definitely a thing and aligns more with what you seem to be looking for?\n\nI honestly don't understand since you seem to be a software person rather than infra: I really don't get at all what your dig is with Cloud. Like what ethical issue do you have with data centers? If anything (ignoring the AI insanity) larger scale data centers that can be put in more sane places and consolidating servers will generally be better environmentally. Maybe job-wise there is also some consolidation as they will spread more part time employees to maintaining things, but I think that evens out when there are still admins required to run things for the business (SaaS excluded of course, but how much time did you spend \"running\" Exchange/Other mail servers). So yeah I think you just have some internal hiccup about this that you might want to just get over.\n\nI do kind of get it in one way, you've done thing in a particular way and you feel that was successful ... but being unable to transfer that success with something that in most aspects is the same as what you were doing already: is a real problem in the long run.

      "text": "I recentlyy attended a Junior DevOps interview for a service-based software company, and wanted to share the actual questions I was asked. Hopefully, it helps others preparing for similar roles. obiviosly did not able to give answers to all the questions, but overall my interview went well. I need to work on my communication skills, especially how to clearly explain the concept and drive the conversation. The god thing is that there were using fireflies service which records entire interview and provide feedback with full conversation, immediately after i got rejection mail.\n\n**Reason for Rejection:**  \nThey want someone who can speak fluent English.\n\n**CI/CD & Version Control**\n\n* Which software do you use as a reverse proxy?\n* How would you rate yourself in GitLab CI/CD out of 10?\n* What are artefacts in GitLab CI/CD?\n* You mentioned GitLab CI/CD and GitHub Actions in your resume:\n* What is the key difference between GitLab CI/CD and GitHub Actions?\n* What is the difference between Git, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI/CD?\n\n**AWS, Hosting & Deployment**\n\n* Have you hosted or deployed any Node.js projects on AWS (EC2 or other AWS services)?\n* Scenario question: Suppose there is one backend Node.js service running in Docker on an EC2 instance.\n* How would you set up an SSL certificate for it?\n* How would you generate the SSL configuration file?\n* Explain the SSL concept and why SSL is required.\n* Have you set up any AWS database services like RDS or Aurora?\n* Migration experience: You mentioned migrating Bitbucket projects to an on-prem GitLab server:\n* What migration strategy did you follow?\n* How did you plan and execute the migration?\n* Have you worked with database migrations using CI/CD pipelines (automated DB migrations)?\n\n**Docker & Containers**\n\n* Write a Dockerfile for a Node.js application using:\n* NPM as the package manager\n* Port 3000\n* What is the difference between ENTRYPOINT and CMD in Docker?\n\n**Frontend, Serverless & CDN**\n\n* Which frontend technologies have you hosted on Firebase?\n* React only?\n* Next.js as well?\n* Have you deployed any applications using AWS Lambda?\n* AWS Lambda limitation question: Lambda has a package size limit. If node\\_modules exceeds the limit, how would you solve it?\n* Difference between EC2 and serverless services like AWS Lambda.\n* What is cold start in AWS Lambda?\n* How does a CDN work?\n* Can only images and videos be cached in a CDN, or can other content be cached too?\n* What are edge servers in a CDN?\n\nEDIT: used chatgpt to format questoins topic wise and to currect english words",

How do you like them apples?” and gave me full FinOps responsibilities.\n\nNow this is a completely new world for me.

A big part of this isn't just \"save money\" - it's effectively communicating how much is being spent on what and presenting the trade-offs for cost savings (cheaper VMs may slow developers down, but that could actually be the right business decision in some scenarios, even though the Devs might hate it).",

Ensure that management do give you that information, do not accept them dodging it. \n\nThen develop some plans and policies. Policies like what you will do for particular levels of business risk (e.g. you'll have 3-way redundant production and 2-way redundant development, or whatever). Those are what you will point to if someone questions your recommendations, because you'll be taking the business management definitions of how important a product  or service is and using your policies to specify how much technical quality to provide.\n\nFinancial people know how to model money and spending. You know how more money buys more flexibility, removes more risk, and increases reliability.  Put those together with what reliability and flexibility the business wants and you get your recommended spending. \n\nBuild automation to check that actual service configurations match the reliability demands - including not enough being spent to match the needs.\n\nAll of that put together will put you in good shape without having to either make business decisions or having people constantly arguing what you say.

You could get included into budget meetings and management meetings for operation cost etc. and can easily get recognised for even higher roles. \n\nTo start i would recommend see everything as a source to optimise cost, firstly by understanding what brings in cost. Datadog to manage and data for your system's APIs and you can provide a cost break-down for each and every API you process via process time x total month process time/total compute cost. provide storage and data cost etc.   \nLook into cost-reliablility ratios such as how important certain things need to be provided a larger instance that will more likely crash like flink connectors that get sudden large amounts of data. what happens if you provide a smaller buffer before autoscaling 60% vs 80%.   \nDiscounts depending on what you use but pretty straight forward cause azure and aws have the Reserved instance calculators you can just use. \n\nBiggest thing i did was just looking at the AWS Bill and going item by item and figuring why it needs to be what it is, and what is causing that cost. E.G. EFS was in the thousands from storing cache from a system that only needed 3 days of cache but was stored indefinitely.   \nSome higher level items could be the allocation of region specific services and the data transfer cost between the servers that could become a issue where you save alot if you break down your data store into region reducing latency and AZ and regional transfer cost.",

          "text": "Always do the math out. You should be spending some time in Excel every day even if it's just to make yourself familiar with the tools. You need to figure out how to predict the changes that different contract terms will make on what you're going to pay for a certain level of use, and you need to game out likely changes in use levels. \n\nA good example of why this is important is that AWS usually offers private pricing on atypical services that not everyone uses, like their speech to text transcription service. Some of them are astoundingly good, to the point where it's worth it to sign up a little higher than your current use because paying the penalty for under-use is *still* cheaper than paying the retail rate for the usage. \n\nThe other thing that usually trips people up is seasonality. most businesses have seasonality in some form, e.g. December is dead or there's a sharp peak at Thanksgiving. Figuring out what your seasonality is and writing contracts so that you're not penalized for your peaks or valleys is important. One of the tricks I'd use with AWS is to change the period for the penalties, e.g. since we had dead spots in July and December I'd ask that our penalties would be calculated for quarterly use or annual use if I could get it instead of monthly use. \n\nThe third is to figure out what the business actually wants. The priority for the CFO is usually not going to be cost *reduction*, it's going to be keeping cloud costs *consistent* and smoothing out any peaks or valleys. But not all finance departments are the same, so you have to ask, and asking this question will often automatically get you a lot of political capital with the finance team. Asking to involve them in PPA negotiations can also help everyone out. \n\nAnd now that I've mentioned it, your most valuable resource in this kind of role isn't technical skill or accuracy. It's political capital. You need to learn how to manage it, which doesn't always mean hoarding it like a dragon.",

          "text": "You'll get a lot of very finops oriented answers, I have a slightly different take from my experience going from purely devops / sre to managing the AWS budget. Hoping my experience might apply here, but it's mostly going to be SaaS focused.  \n\nCost optimizations is like any other optimization problem. Except it's a lot easier to measure, and if you make an impact, and also it's a lot easier for the business to appreciate it.   \n\nNot sure what your leadership expects, sounds like there wan't anyone looking at your cloud bill before. That's like running a service without monitoring, the moment you turn that on you'll find a lot of things to improve.   Hopefully you are not under pressure to reduce your bill significantly immediately.   \n\nYou have one benefit here that most pure finops folk don't have: You know what the systems that are running are, and how they operate. You will look at your bill and see things that make no sense: Focus on those.   \nYour are paying for lots of s3 requests instead of cloudfront? Figure out where that is happening in your app. You'll save money and give your customers a better experience.   \nYour ec2 cost is flatter than you would expect? Go adjust your autoscaling.   \nWait, we are not using service X, why are we paying for it? Go clean that shit up.  \nSpending too much in Dynamo transactions? Go reserve some.   \n\nDoing that is important for a few things:\n1. They are a lot more tangible if you come from devops land\n2. You will quickly learn what costs you have control of, and what is just the cost of running your business (that you'll want to commit to, via reserved instances, savings plans, etc). \n3. Optimizing something and not being able to realize savings because you committed first sucks, or worse: you stop looking for improvements because there is no upside\n4. It will help you familiarize yourself with the tooling. And how pricing works\n\nWhile you do that, celebrate those improvements. Post your cost reports trending down and to the right to your leadership.\n\n\nThe second half of the work, involves spreadsheets... a lot of spreadsheets. But ultimately, in most cases, is a question of risk management:\n1. Am I going to need this data if I move it to glacier?\n2. Is a new instance type going to be released that will make more financial sense than staying on a reservation for the old gen. \n3. Are my compute costs going to remain in this level , go up or go down?\n\nIt's very tempting to overanalize to try to get to the optimal number of how much you should reserve / commit. I've been there done that, saved a bunch of money.  \nBut as I say before: this is a risk management game.   \nYou could do a compute savings plan and commit to what you think is the optimal $ ammount for 3 years for that sweet 50% discount.  \nBut you'll be in a lot better position if you commit 1/3 of that for 3 years the first year, another the next, and again thr following year. (You might want to throw some 1yr commits in there too).  \n\nWhat I'm trying to say here is (if you can) don't be afraid to start small. See what impact you have (I've been hit by unexpected things more than once). Once you feel comfortable, and are more familiar with the risks, making decisions get easier, and the bussiness will trust you to make them. \n\nAnd when you do, let people know how much they are saving. Look back after a year and see what your work saved you. Celebrate that shit.  Because next year's budget already assumes you'll do at least as good, and no one will thank you for that again.",

SIMD pattern matching - Process 32 bytes/instruction instead of 1\n\n2. Double-buffered async I/O - Eliminate I/O wait time\n\n3. Zero heap allocations - All scanning in pre-allocated buffers\n\n4. Pre-compiled query plans - No runtime overhead\n\nResults: 30-60x faster than jq, 20-50x faster than grep\n\nTrade-offs I made:\n\n\\- No JSON AST (can't track nesting)\n\n\\- Literal numeric matching (90 ≠ 90.0)\n\n\\- JSONL-only (no pretty-printed JSON)\n\nFor log analysis, these are acceptable limitations for the massive speedup.\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/aikoschurmann/zog\n\nWould love to get some feedback on this. \n\nI was for example thinking about doing a post processing step where I do a full AST traversal after having done an early fast selection.

I’m not upset about it, since I actually enjoy being a “supposed DevOps,” but I really want to learn and develop useful DevOps skills.\n\nThe only problem is that it’s really hard to become one if you’re not an experienced developer or if you don’t somehow get an opportunity as a junior DevOps.\n\nI’ve had to learn CI/CD, orchestration, containerization, networking, and many other things just by breaking stuff and figuring it out. I’m worried that my path might be leading me in an unprofessional direction.\n\nWhat do you all think? What helped you understand the DevOps role better?",

There's no real way of me to know if this pipeline works unless I just throw some stuff in there, because it's a different version control system with it's own CI\\\\CD pipeline tooling, the app is using a new language, a different cloud platform, a different service, different style of tech overall, so I try to run it, see if it works and if it breaks, I'll just fix it and try again. You can get some information beforehand to try and understand it all but in the end you just gotta throw something at it and hope it works and eventually you learn from those errors and then you won't stumble into them the next time.",

It's much slower than doing it professionally within a company but the foundation can be acquired without much issues.

If all you're doing is tying together off-the-shelf components then you can probably declare a few off-the-shelf dependencies and their values and call it job done. If you're deploying in-house software, you need to invent your own way to describe its configuration from scratch.

But this interacts very badly with my next point...\n\nDevops often seems to be full of people who've failed at SWE or who are at the very beginning of their careers.

Nore does DevOps require \"agile\" processes.\n\n>A lot of companies have moved away what was known as Anti-pattern Type-B with a DevOps team that sits in the middle of development and operations teams.\n\nAside from a few hottake blogs, no one knows this term much less uses it.  And if anything the industry has only *accelerated* its movement towards it rather than away from it, at least when it comes to larger enterprises.\n\n>That role is acutally going away that's been taken over by SRE/Cloud/Platform Engineering teams on the operations side. The middle man DevOps Engineer is removed because it creates a third silio thats inefficient. No need of a seperate CI/CD pipline specialist that slows things down.\n\nNo it's not.  First off if you actually read the entire blog posts you're regurgitating you'd know in the myth that \"SRE\" and \"Cloud\" Engineering roles/teams are just job responsibilities that everyone on the mythical two pizza box \"DevOps Culture Powered Super Team\" is expected to have.  Because it's easy and cheap to build teams entirely comprised of ultra-high-10x-performing super developers where everyone can do everything.\n\nAnd you'd also understand that \"Platform Engineering\" is literally the polar opposite of moving away from \"Anti-pattern Type-B\" DevOps teams.  That's because Platform Engineering is *literally* \"DevOps As A Service\" where the role/team of DevOps has been so completely siloed off that it has become a first class product in and of itself.  It's the natural end-state of DevOps is a role -> DevOps is a team -> DevOps is a service -> DevOps service is rebranded Platform Engineering so we can all get a salary bump.",

      "text": "For the past two years a lot of leadership teams have been chasing the same idea. Reduce headcount, add AI, report higher efficiency.\n\nOn paper it looks brilliant. Cost goes down. Output per employee goes up. The board is happy.\n\nThen production reality starts to show up.\n\nKlarna is the clearest example. Their AI assistant handled the workload of hundreds of support agents and they reduced staff aggressively. The financial metrics improved and revenue per employee went very high.\n\nBut the customer experience dropped. Engineers had to step into support. They started bringing humans back.\n\nSo AI did not fail. The strategy failed. They used AI as a replacement instead of as leverage.\n\nYou can see the same pattern in the McDonald’s AI drive thru pilot. The issue was not that the technology exists. The issue was accuracy in a real environment with real customers. The human fallback had been removed too early.\n\nFiverr also moved to an AI first model and cut a large part of the workforce. What followed was not a pure cost saving story. It became a restructuring into new roles built around AI.\n\nNow look at the companies where the numbers are actually strong.\n\nIBM automated large parts of internal operations and then hired more engineers.\n\nSalesforce increased support capacity and moved people to higher value work.\n\nIn those cases AI increased output per person. It did not remove the need for experienced people.\n\nThis is starting to show up in DevOps and platform teams.\n\nThere is a growing belief in some organisations that AI can run infrastructure, manage incidents, write pipelines and remove the need for senior engineers.\n\nIt can help with log analysis. It can help generate Terraform. It can summarise alerts. It can produce a first version of a runbook.\n\nBut in a real incident you still need someone who understands the system, the business impact and the trade offs. You still need coordination across teams. You still need accountability.\n\nThat part has not changed.\n\nThe companies getting real value from AI are using it to remove toil and to make good engineers faster and more effective.\n\nThe companies cutting teams because they think AI replaces experience are saving money for a few quarters and then rebuilding the same capability under pressure.\n\nCurious what others are seeing.\n\nIs AI in your organisation increasing the impact of the platform team or being used as a reason to reduce it?",

      "text": "Sorry for any typo mistakes, I’ve been up since 3:00am running releases. I have this policy that auditors check to make sure I am adhering to which includes obtaining a director or VP of engineering approval before deploying to higher environments. Our release cycle is aggressive and I’m deploying to one of our higher envs every week on a schedule, and then there’s the need for a hotfix every once in a while. I’ve been at this job for 3.8 years, and have been working as a release engineer, Devops, SRE, or Release Manager for 26 years - so the process of obtaining approvals and adding screenshots or a copy of the approval email into the ticket is not new to me. \n\nI just don’t get it why this VP acts like it is my own personal policy every time I ask for his approval. He says the most ridiculous things at times:\n\n“Why do we even have that policy?”\n\n“Approval was granted when I asked my boss earlier in the break room - just deploy it already, why are you still waiting”\n\nthe most common response is … nothing for 12 hours til I page him in the middle of the night from the zoom call.\n\nOr today “do you want an email? I can have someone in my team send you an email and tell\n\nYou that I received the approval verbally outside of the office this morning..”\n\nI don’t get it. Every Single Time I send him the link to the internal document that clearly defines the process, and I ask him if the policy has changed. He then acts surprised.. I say it is an ‘act’ because there is no way he is forgetting that we just went over this for the 300th time a few days ago.\n\nIt makes me angrier and angrier that he is constantly trying to bypass the policies.. when I leave this job under my own accord, it will likely be because of this stupid and constant interaction with this guy.",

Get the approval workflow into your CI/CD pipeline directly. GitHub/GitLab merge approvals, or even a simple Slack bot that logs VP sign-off with a timestamp. If the approval is just clicking a button in a tool he already uses, the friction drops to near zero and you get an audit trail automatically.\n\n2. Escalate the pattern to your direct manager or the compliance team — not as a complaint about the VP, but as a process gap. Frame it as \"we have a control that's hard to enforce consistently, here's how we can automate it.\" That way you're solving a problem, not pointing fingers.\n\nAfter 26 years you already know this, but document every instance where he pushes back.

DevOps isn't a tool you install; it's a culture and a set of architectural patterns that take years to master.\n\nStop collecting certifications like Pokémon cards. If you have 5 certs but can't debug a broken pipeline or explain why a database migration failed, the paper is worthless. Save your money. Build a homelab, break it, and fix it. That is the only course that matters.",

This is dumb advice for those looking to get a role or shift to DevOps.\n* Stop pretending that \"building a homelab\" is going to get you there. Most enterprises *do not run a homelab* (imagine... crazy shit right there) and have a ton of organizational policies that you need to implement and abide by that are different anywhere. Your tinkering at home with none of that context is just as useless as getting your certs in terms of being capable of actually doing the job.\n\nOverall bad advice and just silly rage bait for certifications. You don't present any sort of useful alternative nor do you add any sort of context of who it's for pretending like this is good general advice. I hope no one listens to you and I feel truly bad for any junior folks who might be relying on your poor takes to develop their careers.\n\nYour baseline premise that learning DevOps in a 6 week bootcamp is not possible is fine (and truly not unpopular as many note), but boy the content of your post is just full of being really freaking ignorant.",

Harbor is lighter, but once you go multi-region with replication and RBAC complexity, it gets messy.\n\nBig gap I still see: clean multi-cloud replication with conflict handling and observability built in. Most tools say “replication,” but debugging drift or partial failures is painful. Also, first-class SBOM management and policy enforcement tied to CI would be huge.\n\nIf you’re building this, I’d focus hard on: HA story, backup/restore simplicity, and how it behaves at scale (1000s of repos, heavy CI churn). That’s where most open-source projects fall apart.\n\nHow are you handling metadata storage and horizontal scaling under high push/pull concurrency?",

Stateless + Tokio means you can just run more replicas behind a load balancer when concurrency spikes.\n\nReplication is peer mesh rather than hub-and-spoke, with per-repo sync schedules, task-level error tracking, and health-scored routing. Drift observability is honestly still rough, that's the part I'm least happy with and it's high on the roadmap.\n\nSBOM (CycloneDX + SPDX) and CVE tracking are built in. Policy enforcement tied to CI is partially there. Backup is a single tar.gz to S3 or filesystem, nothing fancy.\n\nHA is my honest weak spot right now. The stateless backend + Postgres HA gets you pretty far, and peers give geographic redundancy, but true active-active failover isn't there yet.

If CPU > 90% for 15 minutes, that's different from a 30-second spike\n- Correlate alerts. If 6 alerts fire within 2 minutes, that's probably one incident, not six. Most monitoring tools can group these but nobody sets it up\n\nThe other pattern that kills teams: alerting on the same thing at multiple layers. Your app alerts on slow DB queries, your infra alerts on high DB connections, your DB alerts on lock contention — it's all the same incident generating 3 separate pages.\n\nWe went from ~40 alerts/day to about 5 by ruthlessly deleting anything that wasn't directly tied to user impact or data loss risk.

We did an audit and found like 70% of our alerts had never led to a real action being taken, they were just noise that people acknowledged and moved on from. Killed all of those immediately.\n\nThe other thing that made a huge difference was correlating alerts instead of treating them individually. A disk filling up + high latency + increased error rate on the same service within a 5 min window is one incident, not three separate pages. Most monitoring tools are terrible at this out of the box tho, we ended up building some basic correlation logic ourselves. Theres some newer AI-powered observability tools that claim to do this automatically but honestly the ones ive tried are still pretty hit or miss.\n\nThe hard truth is alert fatigue is usually a symptom of not having clear SLOs defined. Once you know exactly what \"healthy\" looks like for each service, you only alert on deviations from that. Everything else becomes a dashboard metric you check during business hours",

It could be direct (trigger ansible, terraform, etc.) or indirect (create AWX request for higher level of abstraction and/or auditing).\n\nYou didn’t say what actions you need to take but you should be able to automate routine tasks… but be sure to think about how much authority to release. In some cases the fact that the person has access to Jira is enough since you have other controls like letting people only run three instances at a time.

It's an idea on the list I might try.\n\nDevelopers start by consuming the configurable GitHub workflow I created, calling it in their repo. They integrate by adding helm charts to their repo. They make a tiny PR to the platform repo to register their runners and ECR repos (abstracted as a list they add an entry to). So it's self service. Of course I have docs/guides as well. \n\nFrom there they just make PRs in their repo. If build passes, after merge, CI automatically makes another PR to bump the image referenced in the helm chart and they merge to release to EKS. Namespaced, and everything. \n\nI standardized local dev using Tilt and when the team wants I encourage using k8s with docker desktop because then they can just reuse the same helm charts locally as in prod.\n\nI have a team of like 10 devs who rotate between different internal projects all using it. The most complaints I've gotten are people who have crappy dev laptops (*cough*windows*cough*) and have trouble running containers locally.\n\nI suppose I could work towards automating even more of this.

Nobody would deploy a service and never review whether it's still needed, but somehow we all just let metrics and log pipelines accumulate forever.\n\nWhat actually worked for us was writing a simple script that queries the DD API for all custom metrics, then cross-references which ones appear in any dashboard or monitor. Anything orphaned goes on a list. We review it monthly and it takes maybe 20 minutes now. The first time we ran it we found over 40% of our custom metrics weren't referenced anywhere.\n\nThe other thing that saved us real money was being aggressive about log exclusion filters at the agent level. Health checks, readiness probes, noisy debug logs from third-party libraries — all of that was being indexed by default. Pushing those filters as close to the source as possible cut our log ingest bill in half without losing anything useful.",

If your monitoring bill is more than \\~5-8% of what you're monitoring, something is off. It's a simple ratio but it gives you a sanity check and a number to track over time.\n\nFor the \"how do you know what's safe to remove\" question — we wrote a simple script that hits the DD API to find metrics not referenced in any dashboard or monitor, and also checks the metrics/search endpoint to see last query time. The combination of \"not in any dashboard AND not queried in 60 days\" is a pretty safe removal candidate.\n\nThe root cause though is what another commenter said — treat your observability pipeline like application code. New metrics should go through a review process just like new infrastructure. If you don't gate it, it'll grow unchecked.",

For incidents, PagerDuty's incident response docs + Etsy's \"Debriefing Facilitation Guide\" will teach you more than another Kubernetes course. Also go read Netflix's Chaos Engineering/SRE-ish posts: not because you need Chaos Monkey, but because it forces you to think in failure modes and recovery time.",

You read that right, Brazil is fucked. The average monthly salary in Brazil is somewhat close to USD 1.1k. The usual salary paid to junior, semi-senior and senior engineers are somewhat around 2-3k, 2.5-4k, 4-5k USD, respectively.\n\nMy latest salary was 2.8k month.\n\nI've been trying to interview but I can't get any offering above 2k, sometimes less. Conversely I've been stating my expected compensation range to be around 3k, because I think... no point in asking for more if no one is offering that anyway, right?\n\nI also need to work (currently unemployed), I have rent to pay and a family to feed and I feel like if I ask for more I just won't get any callbacks. Am I wrong in this assumption?\n\nHow did you guys broke the 3-4 k barrier?",
