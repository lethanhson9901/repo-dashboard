I've asked them if they got this \"solution\" from an LLM and no one ever wants to admit it. I try to be careful and respectful, as I don't like bashing people's code as some junior devs often write sloppy solutions but I enjoy helping them and accepting their PR and showing them how I clean it up better, like a teachable moment. I rarely see this now at all.\n\nI love using AI as a dev myself. It csn save me a lot of time, but people often think they have a solution but it's not. For example, a recent PR I got did not fix a reported bug that popped up when parent software updated (mine is a popular plugin). I was busy for the weekend so didn't get an instant fix out. The solution I was sent was just something that check input type and if not valid, boolean gated the whole function away. It didn't resolve the source of the bug, or ask the question \"Why am I getting null data on this API call I am passing into my function when before I didn't?\" It didn't ask what downstream side effects or problems would it cause not running this function. They just felt it was a solution because they prevented the bug from showing up, when it would be a big problem in many other conditions as this was critical infrastructure. True source of issue was just they moved the API into a different namespace and I got that by reading release note docs thst came out days back, and there is no way any trained LLM would have access to.\n\nWhat happened? I chatted with the dude who submitted PR about it and he finally admitted to me he used Gemini 3 pro and told me that the AI was smarter than me and I shouldn't be so arrogant and that I just didn't want to give him credit for a fix when I rejected the PR.\n\nSo ya, I don't blame the Curl team at all.",

The issues are *so* dead simple that anyone with 0 experience in our tech stack or even programming in general can come in, get them done in under a minute, open a PR and be done with it. \n\nLo and behold, the repo has gotten 100+ new, one-and-done contributors and an according number of stars and forks, to the point where I feel that I'm cheating the system and GitHub's algorithm by doing this; the automatically-created \"good first issues\" are monotone and brain-dead at best, and even though their contents technically reach the end-users, these issues/contributions provide no real meaningful value other than consistently and artificially inflating my repo's star/fork/contributors count. \n\nSo, am I cheating?

I probably had a harder time learning to setup Xcode and compile plus open my first PR and use git 😅 (I think it was the first time I used git rebase when asked during review and having no clue what that was)\n\nI still felt quite proud of that contribution and it was cool adding a feature that I wanted to software I was using. I am just lucky the maintainer / reviewer was kind and responsive, some projects I've since contributed to were unpleasant (_one time I even got banned from an entire github organisation just for trying to improve some docs on security because I somehow triggered a reviewer by explaining why something they were stubborn about as an expert was mistaken and they took that as an insult_).",

Self-hosting is not a reliable long-term backstop because GitLab can stop releasing features in the Open Source version whenever they want. (And also, self-hosting GitLab sucks.)\n\nForgejo and Gitea are not GitHub-style project hosting services, but software for (self-)hosting repositories.\n\nCodeberg is a Forgejo instance that's open to the public. However, Codeberg e.V. has certain goals. Public repos MUST have a FOSS license, and private repos are discouraged. This is a lot less flexible than what GitHub and GitLab give you.\n\nSelf-hosting is *not* the solution to all our problems. Hosting software responsibly requires continuous maintenance and monitoring. For most software, self-hosting also prevents the formation of community, as self-hosted instances are too small to develop network effects. I do not wish to juggle separate accounts for every project I interact with, and I want it to be very easy for users to submit bug reports to the software that I maintain.",

It a complicated mess that ends up being more work to figure out how it works than to use it and profit from it. \n\n3.

Every one of the big players was once \"some skunk-works project\" that people took a gamble on, and plenty of very large and successful organizations routinely try out startups and other \"no-name\" products to help guide their development and control costs.

      "text": "Hi r/opensource,\n\nI recently needed a webcam for my desktop but didn't want to buy new hardware when my phone's camera is already 4K-capable. I looked at the popular solutions (DroidCam, iVCam, Camo), but I was frustrated by the common \"freemium\" patterns: watermarks, low-resolution limits, ads, and closed-source binaries.\n\nSo, I decided to build **VCamdroid**—a completely free, open-source, and privacy-friendly alternative.\n\n**The Project:** It allows you to stream your Android camera to your Windows PC and use it as a native input in apps like OBS, Zoom, and Discord.\n\n**The Tech Stack (The fun part):**\n\n* **Android App (Server):** Uses `Camera2` API and `MediaCodec` to encode a hardware-accelerated H.264 RTSP stream.\n* **Windows Client (Receiver):** Written in **C++** with **wxWidgets**. It uses **FFmpeg** to decode the stream with low latency.\n* **Virtual Driver:** Implements a **DirectShow** filter (based on `Softcam`) to register the video stream as a system-wide virtual device.\n* **Transport:** Supports standard Wi-Fi or **USB tunneling** (via ADB port forwarding) for a lag-free wired connection.\n\n**Why I'm sharing it here:**\n\n1. **No Bloat:** No ads, no tracking, no \"Pro\" subscription.\n2. **Local Only:** The video stream never leaves your local network (or USB cable).\n3. **MIT License:** You can fork it, break it, or build upon it.\n\nI’m currently looking for feedback on the Windows installer and the latency performance on different devices. If you have C++ or Android experience, I’d love to see some PRs (especially for audio support!).\n\n**Repo:** [https://github.com/darusc/VCamdroid](https://github.com/darusc/VCamdroid)",

It works for personal or business accounts, however you'd like to use it. Supports approx. 7k banks in the USA.\n\nI found a lot of different open sourced options out there, but a lot of them were paywalled or blocked features that made the app useless without a lot of manual labor. I made something simple and useful without needing an expensive monthly fee to use. I also plan on open sourcing a few other tools I made for other businesses as well.\n\nWhether you like to collaborate with me or give some feedback, happy to meet you!\n\nEDIT: Clarified that Teller is a financial provider, and to use the app you'd have to consent to their terms of service and data usage policy.",

Quickbooks for example lowest tiered plan is around $35.\n\nSince syncing transactions is free as long as you stay under 100 accounts.

Just rename it in settings\n* **Geofences** \\- auto-pause tracking at home/work (privacy + battery)\n* **No cloud/telemetry/tracking** \\- your data stays on your device or YOUR server\n* **Open source** ([Github](https://github.com/dietrichmax/colota))\n\n**Example use cases:**\n\n* Live map on your personal website\n* Simple `INSERT INTO locations` to PostgreSQL\n* Home Assistant webhook\n* Literally any server that accepts POST requests\n\n**Current integrations that work:**\n\n* Dawarich (works great out of the box)\n* OwnTracks Recorder\n* Home Assistant\n* Custom backends (just needs to accept JSON)\n\n**Features in roadmap:**\n\n* Smart Geofence Management (Visual geofence editor (drag to resize) and Statistics: \"You spent 8 hours at work today\"\n* Location History Trail with Date Filter (See your movement paths over time)\n* Statistics Dashboard (Distance traveled (daily/weekly/monthly; Most visited locations)\n\n**I need 12 beta testers for Google Play requirements** (14 days)\n\nIf you have:\n\n* ✅ Android phone\n* ✅ Your own server (or want to test offline mode)\n* ✅ 5 minutes to install and give feedback\n\nJoin the Google Group [https://groups.google.com/g/colota-beta-testing/](https://groups.google.com/g/colota-beta-testing/) and then you can download the beta version at [https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.Colota](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.Colota)\n\n**FAQ:**\n\n*Q: Does it drain battery?*  \nA: \\~5-10% per hour with optimizations. Silent zones help a lot.\n\n*Q: What's the difference vs OwnTracks?*  \nA: Persistent SQLite (OwnTracks uses memory), better retry logic, built-in export, no server software required.\n\n*Q: Do I NEED a server?*  \nA: Nope. Works 100% offline. Server is optional. You can export data from the app and use it e.g. in QGIS\n\n*Q: What data does it send?*  \nA: Only GPS coords to YOUR endpoint. Zero telemetry.\n\nFree forever. No ads. Open source.",

I used OwnTracks myself for years and decided to create a separate tool for the following reasons:  \n  \nClient-First Philosophy: Unlike Traccar or OwnTracks, which are built to work with a specific ecosystem, Colota is \"backend-agnostic.\" You aren't forced to use a specific server. With our **Custom Field Mapping**, you can rename API fields in seconds to match **Dawarich**, **Home Assistant**, **Node-RED**, or any custom REST API.\n\nLocalized Geofencing (Privacy Focus): In most systems, geofences are handled by the server. In Colota, the logic happens on your device. When you enter a \"Silent Zone,\" the app stops tracking and saving coordinates immediately. Your backend never even knows you arrived. The data simply isn't recorded. Your privacy stays on your phone.\n\nData Ownership & Transparency: You can view, verify, and delete every single coordinate directly in the app. If you don't want to use a server at all, Colota works as a powerful offline logger. You can export your data as local files whenever you want to create custom maps or backups without ever touching a cloud service.\n\nModern UI & Feedback While other clients often feel like \"set and forget\" background tools, Colota gives you a live, interative map with animated markers and clear status indicators, so you always know exactly what is being recorded and why.",

It means you should expect apps like web browsers, FTP clients, and download managers to be faster and more responsive.\n\n> This is because the asynchronous socket support can handle multiple network tasks at once and keep the app running while waiting for data from the internet. \n\nSo this hobbyist / novelty OS is finally able to do what _any_ decent OS can do since ages, basically to allow a program to load a web page without freezing up completely until having loaded the whole thing. \n\nToo bad you can’t test it as booting a nightly ReactOS image is like a Russian rulette, mostly ending with a blue screen, admittedly without even testing it. \n\nThis is not a criticism against ROS developers, they are doing this as a hobby, and it’s an interesting project. Instead I direct this to the author of the article, who tries to frame this as the “windows alternative”.",

They then closed the issue as unplanned. So, I made a fork and implemented it myself.\n\nMy fork is now approaching similar visibility to the original repo and the author has since reopened the original issue, done a complete 180 on their stance and are saying that after seeing my fork, they think that it would be a good idea to implement and they are going to begin working on it.\n\nAm I wrong to be annoyed by this? I've told the author that I think it would be a good idea to keep the original/fork separated due to one using piracy and one not using it, but they remained adamant that they wanted to take my idea and implement it in their repo. To me, this seems like they just want to remove the need/viability of my fork after seeing it growing in popularity.",
