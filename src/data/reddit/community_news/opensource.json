KeePass has a clunky way to share passwords with its AutoOpen feature and having a shared secondary database, but it doesn't translate well across all devices.\n\nI also really like the bitwarden capability of giving emergency access to your database. A trusted person can request access to your personal password database, and if you don't reject it within a certain timeframe, the server will give them access. Bitwarden implemented this in a way that keeps the server admin (ie themselves or whoever hosts the server) from being able to give themselves access, so everything remains encrypted end-to-end and at rest. [https://bitwarden.com/help/emergency-access/#how-it-works](https://bitwarden.com/help/emergency-access/#how-it-works)\n\nI really miss the keyboard switching on android and the 'share url' feature to explicitly initiate a search, as it's more reliable than Android requesting autofill.",

Not because privacy is bad, but because privacy alone doesn’t make a product succeed or fail.\n\nPrivacy is like data security. It’s table stakes. \\*\\*Ideally\\*\\* every app has it. But nobody signs up because you say “this social app has never been hacked.” There has to be some other hook.\n\nI’m saying this because I keep seeing a lot of time and energy go into launches that don’t go anywhere, simply because they’re built on the wrong premise.\n\nNow i know half the people building these are just having fun and dont intend to have people use it. But for those that want to really build something, I think its important to know that the pricacy alone wont get you signups. ​",

                  "text": "New tools are also harder to evaluate these days due to vibe coding (not necessarily an end app itself but potentially any libraries used too).\n\nYou can compare to an existing solution you adopted and that the functionality you want is still covered with the bonus of performance or whatever other metric, but now one needs to be extra cautious about what else is going on, or how certain improvements are achieved.\n\nWhile there was bugs / vulnerabilities in software before the broader adoption of AI, not only does AI tooling itself introduce these risks, it can often be seen changing a development process that favors velocity and delegation (_at worse delegating knowledge and trust without any human verification_) but it also lowers the barrier to entry building out such products with vast inexperience that it enables an entirely different author and with that a mindset/goals.\n\nAll of which compounds to far more risk that as an experienced dev, I worry about that impact and how much trouble that brings. Before it was easier to assess an OSS library, but now certain signals that helped establish trust are getting ruined 😅\n\nMore so perhaps for SaaS springing up with APIs or community sites offering user uploads or storage of secrets / PII data. Stuff that I assume will become more common to lean into AI. Just recently a community service for sharing content was exposed to have an XSS vulnerability through SVG uploads that are displayed as a thumbnail for listing user content. That could run JS and steal authentication cookies due to being served from the same origin. Another was a desktop app that you let read your github data but it requested full write permissions that it shouldn't need.\n\nSome devs struggling to maintain more niche projects like libraries are leaning into AI (even if just for review and suggested changes) which is introducing subtle bugs / regressions as the advice sometimes isn't even questioned / discussed in public just applied and merged. More common when the change falls out of the author / reviewers (human) expertise, that they assume the AI probably knows better vs time to verify and grok bad advice.\n\nAI aside, these can still be relevant concerns. Some stuff can be faster by skipping functionality that can be important but not apparent on the surface. I've seen that on project announcements including new DBs from inexperienced devs that know just enough to make it seem like a plausible alternative until someone chimes in why it's significantly faster and how that can lead to data corruption or other concerns 😅",

              "text": "Community popularity is a bit of a tricky metric these days. Take `mise` for example. Lots of stars and community praise. \n\nThat's fully developed with heavy AI assist / workflows. The code base isn't particularly friendly to human contributors (_lots of repeated logic that should have been DRY and thus prone to diverging over time, especially from AI oriented development processes_).\n\nIts true that it's a great tool for the functionality as not many other options exist that can compete. However there are regressions and progressive NIH approach to remove external ecosystem integration to the authors own variant of a tool, one that manages secrets IIRC (`fnox`), yet confidently claiming it's security / trustworthy as if it should be right up there with projects from developers that specialise in that area of development.\n\nWorse the project uses CalVer when SemVer is far more appropriate for using a tool like that (eg: within CI workflows). This is favored to not worry about breaking changes (_which occurred often enough before I sifted through the project on github_), velocity is favored.\n\nPRs are regularly created with an AI summary and rarely any other context references for why the PR was created or decisions that were made.\n\nNo real review process, CI runs, some test suites fail and it merges. Github issues are disabled in favor of Github discussions, which the developer insisted was more appropriate (probably due to popularity / engagement). I feel that they're only OSS to help with adoption and leverage free compute like CI and AI tools that have free tiers for OSS projects, rather than embracing OSS community and practices.\n\nThats from an experienced / established dev too, not just an inexperienced vibe coder which would be far worse.\n\n---\n\nAnother example is a website that is OSS on github, again experienced dev (but like 40k commits in a year when they switched to using AI for development velocity).\n\nThey served user content from the same origin as authentication cookies, no sanitising of content like SVG for associating an image with a user upload (the site is for sharing community automation extensions and discovery).\n\nThis tool and site were quite popular, but a mistake like this permitted an attacker to use SVG for their extension page (which has that graphic appear in list views elsewhere),  running JS to steal authentication session and if that viewer that was compromised was logged in with any of their own extensions published they'd get modified with the same infection to spread and the attacker had access to a refresh token and provisioning of API tokens from this point. So they could publish these extensions with actual malware given the deployment environments access to additional resources and secrets which a much larger user base would consume (eg: for social media management or deploying servers).\n\nOne of their other projects did get a bug report about their app requesting full write permission token to github when it should only need limited read access scope. No engagement in weeks by the dev that continued to iterate on the project adding more features. Perhaps too much signal noise that they didn't even notice the report, or in their opinion it's not a concern? 🤷‍♂️\n\nPrivacy / security is important but even if that's claimed and is popular it's something we have to be more cautious about at face value. Especially if AI is leading that development, where some believe that just asking their AI tooling to perform reviews that ensure it respects those goals doesn't actually mean it can be trusted to deliver that properly 😅 (_but it will still be claimed to attract a demographic, even if the dev is well intentioned if they're not actively trying but just relying on implementation through delegation, they may feel confident that it is the truth whilst not knowing any better_)",

But the tools i found for my package manager didn't allow for much customization. So I tried some online qr code generator, which offered fancy design options. When I scanned the generated qr code, they led to some random URL that expired after a week unless I paid.  \nSo I took it upon myself to build a simple CLI tool that generates company branded QR codes, which could also be integrated into automation workflows. The next step was to generalize this tool by adding command options so anyone could customize their QR codes easily. That's how **QR Code Pretty** came to life.\n\nFor those wondering why I'm only promoting it only now (after 8 months): I just never got around to packaging it for easy installation...until now.\n\n  \nCheck out some pretty samples in my repo!",

Testing a localhost API shouldn’t need an internet connection.\n\nSo we asked a simple question: What if an API tool respected how developers already work?\n\nThat led to a few core ideas:\n\n  \\- Offline-first, no accounts, no telemetry\n\n  \\- Git as the source of truth\n\n  \\- Specs, tests, and docs living together in Markdown\n\nWe opensourced Voiden because extensibility without openness just shifts the bottleneck.\n\nIf workflows should be transparent, the tool should be too.\n\nTake a look here : https://github.com/VoidenHQ/voiden",

      "text": "It appears that the developer of [Borderless Gaming](https://store.steampowered.com/app/388080/Borderless_Gaming/) used Magpie’s code and is selling it as his own software in violation of the GPLv3, while rejecting all accusations\n\nOn [Magpie’s GitHub page](https://github.com/Blinue/Magpie/issues/1367), a large amount of evidence is accumulating showing that the Borderless Gaming developer used Magpie’s GPLv3 code to create a new “reimagined after 11 years” version that is being sold on Steam. This would not be an issue if the license terms were respected. Instead, the Borderless Gaming developer dismisses all accusations, claims the code is his own, and comes up with excuse after excuse for every new piece of evidence\n\nAt first, he had no choice but to admit that all Borderless Gaming shaders are derivatives of Magpie’s shaders, because they are not just similar, but 100% identical, except that MagpieFX was renamed to BGFX. You can literally use a Magpie shader without any changes and it will work. To avoid the implications of the GPLv3 license, which would force him to open-source all of Borderless Gaming, he claims that he created an “aggregate” under Section 5, and that the shaders shipped with the program are an independent product and have nothing to do with his application, which he claims is 100% his own and does not use Magpie’s code\n\nEven this single episode does not stand up to any criticism, because under the same license an “aggregate” must not form a larger program, and in this case it clearly does. Without the shaders, Borderless Gaming is just a non-functional shell and would not have the long list of features introduced in this “reimagined” update. Moreover, despite admitting that all shaders were taken from Magpie, all references to Magpie were removed. No copyright notice, no license reference, nothing. Instead, MagpieFX was renamed to BGFX to create the impression that this is his own development\n\nAs for the binary part of the program, it likely contains the entirety of Magpie’s code, since all or most of Magpie’s class names were found in it. However, the developer categorically denies this, because admitting it would require releasing the entire product’s source code. This stance is very convenient, given that everything was compiled into a binary format and he appears confident that no one has proof. According to him, the class names are merely a coincidence, since the program performs similar functions and there is only one correct way to implement them\n\nTo support his claims, he published the source code of one class, apparently to demonstrate that it was written in a different language, C# versus C++. However, the Magpie developer recognized it as his own code, stating that the entire class, including its structure, control flow, and variable names, was simply ported to C#, which is unquestionably a derivative work\n\nLater, new evidence emerged, this time showing that some Magpie shaders, which are not effects but internal shaders, were fully embedded into the Borderless Gaming binary as plain text. These shaders matched 100%, including variable names and even some fairly unique numeric constants, and also contained comments that were obviously generated by an LLM. This time, the Borderless Gaming developer claimed that the code was supposedly well documented and that he found it on Stack Overflow. When asked to provide the documentation or links to Stack Overflow, he refused, claiming that life is short. His comments explaining why the shader code matched 100% also appear absurd, as if he does not understand what the code is or what it does\n\nThe Magpie developer, on the other hand, stated that this part of his program is poorly documented and that the code is his personal creation, developed through trial and error. Some comments also reveal interesting facts about the Borderless Gaming developer. For example, that he sells a 7 euro program that simply enables file system compression, presenting it as his own compression method. Or that he claims to be the developer of the Rainway service, which was supposedly sold to Microsoft. However, there is no confirmation of this from the company.\n\nThe Magpie developer was advised to contact Valve with this information, clearly suggesting filing a DMCA notice. What he will do next is currently unknown. In the meantime, I decided to share my findings with a wider audience to bring public attention to the matter. It is also possible that someone may be able to gather additional evidence\n\nTldr: The developer of Borderless Gaming has a history of being dishonest and using LLMs. His latest app update is not a clean-room rewrite. He is reusing GPL code, removing attribution, ignoring licensing, and choosing to gaslight others, instead of answering questions\n\nSource: [https://github.com/Blinue/Magpie/issues/1367](https://github.com/Blinue/Magpie/issues/1367)\n\nSteampage: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/388080/Borderless\\_Gaming/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/388080/Borderless_Gaming/)",

It provides a web UI where you can:\n\n* Upload any image and convert it to drawable paths using edge detection (Canny, contours, adaptive thresholding)\n* Automatically detect the drawing boundaries from a phone screenshot using OpenCV\n* Preview, position, scale, rotate, and erase parts of your image\n* Execute the drawing on your phone via ADB swipe commands\n\nThe tool captures a screenshot via ADB, uses Hough line transforms to detect the dotted-line drawing boundaries (which form an L-shape with two exclusion zones), then converts your image to paths and sends `adb shell input swipe` commands to trace them.\n\n**Target Audience**\n\nThis is a fun side project / toy for Revolut users who want custom card designs without drawing by hand. It's also a decent example of practical OpenCV usage (edge detection, line detection, contour extraction) combined with ADB automation.\n\n**Comparison**\n\nI couldn't find any existing tools that do this. The alternatives are:\n\n* Drawing by hand on your phone (tedious, imprecise)\n* Using Revolut's preset designs (limited options)\n\nRevoDraw automates the tedious part while giving you full control over what gets drawn.\n\n**Tech stack:** Flask, OpenCV, NumPy, ADB\n\n**GitHub:** [https://github.com/K53N0/revodraw](https://github.com/K53N0/revodraw)\n\nThis started as a quick hack to draw something nice on my card without wasting the opportunity on my bad handwriting, then I went way overboard. Happy to answer questions about the OpenCV pipeline or ADB automation!\n\nP.S: I am already planning to expand support to more similar cases and will do so in the near future.",

Currently it supports JPG, PNG, WEBP, AVIF, QOI, JXL compression and gives you fully lossless or customizable lossy options as well.\n\nThere are no ads, cookies or trackers and it supports different resizing modes, color reduction, strip EXIF metadata, customizable parallel processing, side by side image comparison and more.\n\nIt uses WebAssembly, so all things happens in your browser. No images are ever uploaded to a server. It also uses WASM for near native performance compared to standard JS based compression.\n\nOther similar websites like Squoosh doesn’t support batch uploads and most of their forks that do support it still has the same problem with Squoosh where you cant compress because of an “Out of memory” error.\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts on the compression quality, any feature suggestions for it, or the UI.",

Pacta supports baseline mode, so you can prevent new violations without fixing the entire past first.\n\nThis tool is Git + tests + metrics for architecture.\n\n---\n\n## Brief Guide\n\n1. Install and define your architecture model:\n\n```bash\npip install pacta\n```\n\nCreate an `architecture.yml` describing your architecture.\n\n2. Save a snapshot of the current state:\n\n```bash\npacta snapshot save . --model architecture.yml\n```\n\n3. Inspect history:\n\n```bash\npacta history show --last 5\n```\n\nExample:\n\n```\nTIMESTAMP            SNAPSHOT    NODES  EDGES  VIOLATIONS\n2024-01-22 14:30:00  f7a3c2...   48     82     0\n2024-01-15 10:00:00  abc123...   45     78     0\n```\n\nTrack trends (e.g., dependency count / edges):\n\n```bash\npacta history trends . --metric edges\n```\n\nExample:\n\n```\nEdge Count Trend (5 entries)\n============================\n\n 82 │                              ●\n    │               ●--------------\n 79 │    ●----------\n    │\n 76 ├●---\n    └────────────────────────────────\n      Jan 15                   Jan 22\n\nTrend: ↑ Increasing (+6 over period)\nFirst: 76 edges (Jan 15)\nLast:  82 edges (Jan 22)\n\nAverage: 79 edges\nMin: 76, Max: 82\n```\n\n4. Enforce architectural rules (`rules.pacta.yml`):\n\n```bash\n# Option A: Check an existing snapshot\npacta check . --rules rules.pacta.yml\n\n# Option B: Snapshot + check in one step\npacta scan . --model architecture.yml --rules rules.pacta.yml\n```\n\nExample violation output:\n\n```\n✗ 2 violations (2 error) [2 new]\n\n  ✗ ERROR [no_domain_to_infra] @ src/domain/user.py:3:1\n    status: new\n    Domain layer must not import from Infrastructure\n```\n\nIf you want to contribute or try project please refer to these links:\n\n**Code:** https://github.com/pacta-dev/pacta-cli\n\n**Docs:** https://pacta-dev.github.io/pacta-cli/getting-started/\n",
