      "text": "I've been following the AI slop problem closely and it seems like it's getting worse, not better.\n\n**The situation:**\n\n* Daniel Stenberg (curl) said the project is \"effectively being DDoSed\" by AI-generated bug reports. About 20% of submissions in 2025 were AI slop. At one point, volume spiked to 8x the usual rate. He's now considering whether to shut down their bug bounty program entirely.\n* OCaml maintainers rejected a 13,000-line AI-generated PR. Their reasoning: reviewing AI code is *more* taxing than human code, and mass low-effort PRs \"create a real risk of bringing the Pull-Request system to a halt.\"\n* Anthony Fu (Vue ecosystem) and others have posted about being flooded with PRs from people who feed \"help wanted\" issues directly to AI agents, then loop through review comments like drones without understanding the code.\n* GitHub is making this worse by integrating Copilot into issue/PR creation — and you can't block it or even tell which submissions came from Copilot.\n\n**The pattern:**\n\nPeople (often students padding resumes, or bounty hunters) use AI to mass-generate PRs and bug reports. The output looks plausible at first glance but falls apart under review. Maintainers — mostly unpaid volunteers — waste hours triaging garbage.\n\nSome are comparing this to Hacktoberfest 2020 (\"Shitoberfest\"), except now it's year-round and the barrier is even lower.\n\n**What I'm wondering:**\n\nIs anyone building tools to help with this? Not \"AI detection\" (that's a losing game), but something like:\n\n* Automated triage that checks if a PR actually runs, addresses the issue, or references nonexistent functions\n* Cross-project contributor reputation — so maintainers can see \"this person has mass-submitted 47 PRs across 30 repos with a 3% merge rate\" vs \"12 merged PRs, avg 1.5 review cycles\"\n* Better signals than just \"number of contributions\"\n\nThe data for reputation is already in the GitHub API (PR outcomes, review cycles, etc). Seems like someone should be building this.\n\n**For maintainers here:** What would actually help you? What signals do you look at when triaging a PR from an unknown contributor?",

This can be done quite easily using a graph database.\n\nIf a user with some reputation decides to begin to spam, it would attract complaints which would decrease the reputation of the user and the people that gave him reputation... so people wouldn't give it like candy.\n\nThat way, projects managers would better filter the first users they give some reputation to otherwise they would lower their reputation as well.

I was able to scan a mid range Samsung 870 EVO 4TB SSD with 1.2% empty space (98.8% full!) in less than two seconds. Then, in under 10 seconds, it scanned 16.1TB of data from a SMB network share on a ZFS array over a 2.5Gb connection.\n\n\nThis is a tremendous improvement over a few years ago when I last updated the app, and the performance over a network share is simply amazing....\n\n\nI'm not affiliated with the project at all, and I can't say when exactly this performance improvement happened. I haven't heard of, and cant really find any news of this update, so please don't flame me for being old news. Just trying to inform folks! :D\n\n\nAlso, this is a Windows application only.

      "text": "Hi,\n\nAround two months ago, I submitted a Feature Request and a PR to a repository that had a GPL-3.0 license. The PR was rejected because it conflicted with a feature of another project of the author. He explicitly marked the FR as \"not planned\". I’ve told him that I’ll continue with this change in a fork. He wasn’t objecting to that. After that, during a period of roughly two months, I added a couple of unique features and was frequently merging upstream into my fork (merging also became more difficult with time). And because I put quite a lot of effort into the fork, also complying with the GPL-3.0 license, I started to think about making a public release. I’ve reached out to the author to see what he was thinking about it. I’ve tried to be friendly, but the farther the discussion went, the stranger his behavior became. At first, he said that he had stabilized his features, and now we can work together on merging my fork. I asked him to give me a day or two to think about it because I’ve put a lot of effort into the fork, and still prefer to publish. Then he told that he will change his license from GPL-3.0 (which gives permission to publish) to one that requires explicit permission from the author. I agreed and said that I will respect it and won’t merge the upstream repo into mine. And he did update the license, and I’ve merged till the latest GPL-3.0 commit, updated the readme, and renamed my repository.\n\nBut quickly he changed his mind and started objecting to me making the public release, also saying that he will implement all features that I have in his repo, and put all efforts to prevent my fork from going public.\n\nI can relate to his feelings partially, but he chose GPL-3.0 in the first place. Before even submitting the first PR, I’ve carefully considered the license terms, because I knew that if I made a PR and the author decide to reject it, then I can continue working on the fork and even publish it later. And with this assumption in mind, I implemented several features in the fork and fixed a couple of bugs. I wouldn’t make a single modification to the source repo if not GPL-3.0.  \n  \nWhat would you suggest? How is it usually handled? I’m a single developer and don’t want to deal with legal staff (though I always followed the license terms and tried to be respectful to the original repository's efforts, never claiming credit for what was implemented there).",

And I often do modification because the fork correlates with what I often do. Not sure about forever though because it's quite a promise :)\n\n\\> So it sounds like there could be an opportunity to get your work over into their project and have them maintain it.\n\nYes, it's a good point. Though, I don't like how he deal with stuff. There was an interest from other folks as well in contributing, but doesn't seem like he wants any BIG contributions. He uses AI-assisted workflow (as he calls it), and I don't like it's code quality (though, it's not bad, I've seen worth).",

      "text": "Recently, a comment from one of the Obsidian team members in the Discord OMG server confirmed that its plugin publishing rules won't adhere to open-source licensing models. It means even if a plugin is developed using a license that grants publishing rights (like GPL-3.0), Obsidian won't accept any forked versions until some conditions are met. For example, an explicit permission from the author is required if the upstream plugin is in active development (GPL-3.0 grants rights to publish without requiring an explicit permission). The [developer policy](https://docs.obsidian.md/Developer+policies) on their website is not yet updated and still uses open-source licensing terms, and it doesn’t explicitly states whether a fork is allowed to publish or not. Quote: \"Include a LICENSE file and clearly indicate the license of your plugin or theme.\"\n\nNotably, seems like even Apple's App Store allows publishing if the forked app follows the license. Is such a change acceptable from the open source perspective? What are your thoughts?\n\n[Source](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/840286264964022302/1455281698345324687)\n\nDisclaimer: The OP is not affiliated with the Obsidian team in any way.",

It smells of **arbitrary decision** which I am triggered by more than other ppl.\n\nOther questions:\n\n1. Does Obsidian pass any of its revenue to the plugin makers?  Could there be a quiet assurance to those that they will not allow forks.\n\n2. Do Obsidian Inc ever kick plugins from being listed for reasons of viability?  Sure they can kick because they belatedly discover the plugin is stealthy-malware that's otherwise convincing as a plugin - and [forks are statistically more likely to be those than originals](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/auto-draft-275/). \n\nOn that last - in package-land generally (Npm, maven-central, apt, brew, etc etc) - I think the repo maintainers are going to have to pivot to owning the compilation-and-package step even if don't provide test-automation capability.

Simple and easy to integrate, but may produce minor color artifacts.\n- PR [#177](https://github.com/Ryan-Millard/Img2Num/pull/177): Uses CIELAB color space for perceptual accuracy. Produces better visual results but is more complex and potentially slower.\n\nAs a maintainer, I want to ensure we end up with a single, high-quality implementation and make that decision as fairly and kindly as possible. I’ve created a GitHub discussion to encourage the contributors to collaborate and combine the best aspects of both PRs, rather than competing against each other: https://github.com/Ryan-Millard/Img2Num/discussions/184\n\nBefore moving forward, I wanted to ask:\n- How do you usually handle situations where multiple contributors submit different implementations of the same feature? I feel like this will be a very tough and possibly opinionated answer.\n- Do you prefer picking one, combining ideas, or encouraging collaboration like I’m attempting to do?\n- Any tips for keeping the process positive and transparent for all contributors? OSS is for everyone, so what I want isn't the important thing in my eyes - I want to get a final product that will benefit everyone.\n\nThank you for making it this far! I trust this sub - you guys always give great answers.\n\nEdit: We came to a conclusion in the discussion (see the link above) and are now implementing the fix. Thank you all for the wonderful advice!",

If so, could you support both through a switch.\n2. If you only want to support one approach, choose the one that will serve most use cases.\n3. A variation of #2, you support one but also support plugins to allow your users to use their approach that fits their scenario.\n\nPS this is a nice problem to have as it means you have people keen on working on your project.",

I used to rely on *DFInstagram* to block the endless scroll, but it hasn't been maintained for a long time and updating it to newer Instagram versions was a pain.\n\nSo I decided to build my own solution: **FeurStagram** \\- an open-source project that removes Instagram's addictive features while keeping the essentials (for Android).\n\nThe FeurStagram repo is on Github : [https://github.com/jean-voila/FeurStagram](https://github.com/jean-voila/FeurStagram)\n\n# Two ways to use it:\n\n* **Ready-to-install APK :** Just grab the latest patched APK from the GitHub releases and install it. No technical skills needed! DIY Patching Toolkit. You can install the apk file from here : [feurstagram-410-1-0-63-71.apk](https://github.com/jean-voila/FeurStagram/releases/download/v410-1-0-63-71/feurstagram-410-1-0-63-71.apk)\n* You can also patch any Instagram version yourself using the included scripts\n\n# What gets blocked:\n\n* ❌ Feed posts (blocked at network level)\n* ❌ Explore tab (redirects to DMs)\n* ❌ Reels tab (redirects to DMs)\n\n# What still works:\n\n* ✅ Stories\n* ✅ Direct Messages\n* ✅ Profile\n* ✅ Reels shared in DMs (so you can still view what friends send you, but can't scroll)\n* ✅ Search\n* ✅ Notifications Why this approach? Unlike DFInstagram which stopped being updated:\n\n**Pre-built APKs available** \\- just download and install from releases\n\n**DIY option -** if you want a specific Instagram version, you can patch it yourself\n\n**Future-proof -** when Instagram updates, I'll release the new patched version (or you can patch it yourself)\n\n**I**t's open source, you can see exactly what it does. no shady modifications, just blocks unwanted content\n\n# The toolkit uses two patching strategies:\n\n* **Network-level blocking -** intercepts Instagram's API calls and blocks feed content at the source\n* **Tab redirection -** when you tap Explore or Reels, it opens DMs instead The result: Instagram becomes purely a communication tool. You can still message friends, view their stories, check notifications, and use your profile. But no more doomscrolling through the feed, no explore rabbit holes, no endless reels.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts and feedback.\n\n",

Me and my friend made a shitty mini-OS in Python called WayOS.  \nIt's an early version with a simple UI, some basic games (Snake, Calculator, etc.), a mini file manager, and terminal commands like help, joke, insult...  \n\nWe just want to share it and see if anyone wants to tinker with it, contribute, or send tips!  \n\nRepo link: https://github.com/pocofan1264/WayOS-1.0  \n\nNOTE: It's super early and probably has bugs. If you find any issues or have ideas, feel free to open an issue or email us at thewayosteam@gmail.com  \n\nThanks! Hope you enjoy the chaos :D",

I'd like to start by apologising for how some people here have responded to this post (they think this subreddit is dedicated only to them, which makes them angry when they see people with similar problems post about their problems). It isn't very nice, and it makes getting help very challenging. \n\nHere are my recommendations:\n1. Follow this subreddit - a lot of people post their projects here, and you may find one that excites you.\n2. Follow subreddits and other similar social media groups that post about things you're interested in.\n3. Ask this question elsewhere and maybe here again in a month or two if you don't find somewhere that you'd like to contribute.\n4. Consider any packages you currently use and see if there are any issues that seem doable on their repository.\n\nIt isn't easy to find someone else's project to work on because that requires advertising on their part, which can be tough.\n\nIf you're interested, I have an OSS project ([Img2Num](https://github.com/Ryan-Millard/Img2Num/)) that is relatively new (no releases yet) and open to beginners and new contributors who would like to shape the repository. It uses C++ compiled to WebAssembly (so we have no backend) to convert any image into a color-by-number template that allows users to color their image directly in their browser.\n\nDon't lose hope! You will find the perfect project soon. Happy New Year!🥳✨️",

Fully local. Simulated tasks can loop, trigger at startup, or be launched via a desktop shortcut.\n\nMicrosoft Store: [https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xp9cjlhwvxs49p](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xp9cjlhwvxs49p)    \nSource code and issues: [https://github.com/AmirHammouteneEI/ScheduledPasteAndKeys](https://github.com/AmirHammouteneEI/ScheduledPasteAndKeys)   \nPortable (v1.6) : [https://files.amirhammoutene.dev/Tasket++/1.6/Tasket++\\_v1.6.zip](https://files.amirhammoutene.dev/Tasket++/1.6/Tasket++_v1.6.zip)\n\nI’m not asking for a full QA process — a short impression or concise feedback will be greatly appreciated.

So this is all my thoughts, speculation, and understanding.\n\nWithout understanding exactly what OP has made 100%, the idea of temp emails for various things is huge. It is good for services you might not want to keep an account for, or for things tat you KNOW will try and spy on you but you have no choice. \n\nThe reason you wouldn't do what we have in the past with a 'professional' inbox and a 'catch all' inbox comes down to fingerprinting and account access. With enough time I can match your personal box and your spam box together and it would take just a bit of effort. This is called fingerprinting. Also, account access for an account that is left open for a service can create an issue where the attacker can gain access to the actual email, depending on how you do things like passwords and such. Further, most people create their spam email with their main email as a backup. This is just a nice little back door for an attacker because you likely got lazy and forgot about it. (which no shame, I didn't realize it myself at one point)\n\nAs for blocked domains, this is a Bring Your Own Domain bit of kit. So a blocked domain depends on YOU not OPs domains.",

Strange that this discussion would be censored on r/arduino, but oh well. \n\nAlso, I'm sure courts in your country would have something to say about \"adhesion contracts\" - where customers with no bargaining power are made to sign terms because they have no other choice, i.e., a take-it-or-leave-it approach. This phrase is fairly universal, so it can be a good starting point to understand how your country might deal with this situation. \n\nArduino's updated terms are exactly that, and they also go a step further by presuming acceptance on part of the users by their usage of the Platform. While this has become somewhat standard, it can still be used to argue that the terms of a contract are unfair. \n\nCourts will generally have the power to intervene in such contracts, even if the language used may be different. On the other hand, the fair use defence can look vastly different in each country, so that really comes down to whether your country has encapsulated the doctrine in legislation. \n\nDo let me know if you dive deeper into this, it sounds fascinating.

I just wanted to share my first \"officially released\" opensource project.\n\nMy motivation for building this project in the first place was to fix the annoying problem with Electron apps' audio streams within pavucontrol or other audio control apps. All electron apps would always show up as \"Chromium\" with the chromium icon despite all being different apps. Another issue was that WirePlumber also couldn't differentiate the different electron apps, and always resets all electron apps to the same volume setting. If you ever found these issues also annoying, this project might be for you!\n\nIf it isn't already obvious enough, this app is for Linux only (and really, only Linux has any use for this app). It's currently only tested for Arch Linux (and is also on the AUR), so if you are interested, I would really appreciate if you could test out on your machines and distros as well!\n\nPlease check out the repos for more info.\n\nCodeberg: [https://codeberg.org/ponleou/pipetron](https://codeberg.org/ponleou/pipetron)  \nGitHub (mirror): [https://github.com/ponleou/pipetron](https://github.com/ponleou/pipetron)",

GraphQLite is an SQLite extension that brings graph database functionality to SQLite using the Cypher query language.\n\nThe idea came from wanting graph queries without the operational overhead of running Neo4j for smaller projects. Sometimes you just want to model relationships and traverse them without spinning up a separate database server. SQLite already gives you a single-file, zero-config database—GraphQLite adds Cypher's expressive pattern matching on top.\n\nYou can create nodes and relationships, run traversals, and execute graph algorithms like PageRank, community detection, and shortest paths. It handles graphs with hundreds of thousands of nodes comfortably, with sub-millisecond traversal times. There are bindings for Python and Rust, or you can use it directly from SQL.\n\nI hope some of y'all find it useful.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/colliery-io/graphqlite](https://github.com/colliery-io/graphqlite)",

With Booster, we’re trying to improve the experience by using voluntary ads that give rewards to users, allowing them to boost and support their favorite channels and friends directly, and avoid content made with AI and Vertical Short Form videos.\n\nThe theme you see right now in the screen is now available for free to every user who logs in and creates a new account. We would like to know from webdevs, how we can improve it and make it better, and also know if there is any bugs or something you would llike to point out.\n\nRegarding costs, we've solved the high costs of infrastructure thanks to our provider, so it doesn't pose a big expense, thanks to their encoding and CDN.\n\nRegarding revenue, monetization currently would come from a virtual currency called XP, which users can either earn for free by watching voluntary feature videos or purchase. XP is used to boost channels and buy personalization assets. We also plan to implement voluntary, rewarded ads that give users free XP. The goal is to test whether users and creators actually like and adopt this model.\n\nModeration is made through community votes, which are a way of letting the users and the common viewer decide if the report of a specific user was accurate or not.\n\nIn the link, we've included the about page, which includes how Booster works, plus the Discord and the open GitHub.",
