      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI recently reached a big milestone and open-sourced my project, Senlo (a drag-and-drop email builder), under the AGPL-3.0 license. I was excited to contribute to the community and see how others might build upon it.\n\n  \nWell, it didn't take long for the \"dark side\" of OSS to show up. Today, I stumbled upon a fork of my repo. I was initially happy to see interest, but then I looked at the changes. The user had:\n\n1. Completely deleted the LICENSE file.\n2. Totally removed README and ROADMAP files.\n\nIt’s honestly a bit disheartening. I spent months building the rendering engine and the editor logic. I chose AGPL-3.0 specifically to ensure that the project remains open for everyone, but seeing someone try to \"re-brand\" it as their own proprietary work less than 14 days after launch is a gut punch.\n\nI’ve already filed a DMCA takedown notice with GitHub.\n\nI’m not posting this for self-promotion (I’m intentionally not linking my repo unless someone asks), but I wanted to ask the community: Is this a common \"rite of passage\" for new OSS developers?\n\nHow do you guys deal with the frustration when people try to steal your hard work so blatantly? Are there any other steps I should take besides the GitHub complaint to protect the integrity of the license?\n\n",

If you add SPDX-License-Identifier (and copyright notices) to the main source files and organize licensing metadata in a REUSE-friendly way (for example a LICENSES/ directory), it becomes much more work for a bad actor to “strip” licensing and attribution, and it’s easier to document what happened if you need to escalate later.",

I haven’t been told about a large org yet like Netflix, my gut tells me internally, it’s probable and maybe happening, they may be just validating but it takes time.  I know people do use it, I don’t generally go and make a list, maybe I should though!    I benchmark against RocksDB everyday and TidesDB is just superior on throughput, cv, latency, even space up to x6 less space, oh and less wear on your drives than RocksDB by up to 30%, the choice is on you :)\n\nI don’t push people, the choice is up to them, I’ll keep making TidesDB the best it can be regardless.  I’ll keep being honest about the code, the benchmarking.  Keep making valuable content.  Again it’s my life, I love it!\n\nCheers",

It’s a learning project that borrows service management concepts from PM2 and scheduling logic from Airflow, packed into a \\~90KB zero-dependency JAR.\n\n  \n[https://github.com/ramn51/DistributedTaskOrchestrator](https://github.com/ramn51/DistributedTaskOrchestrator)\n\nI started this because I just wanted to offload heavy scripts to a spare laptop in my homelab. Over time, it evolved into a proper platform: I added lifecycle management for long-running services, then reactive auto-scaling (and descaling) to manage resources efficiently. You can define workflows using simple YAML for static sequences, or use the Python SDK to construct DAGs programmatically.\n\nInterestingly, adding that programmatic control (Dynamic DAGs) ended up making it a solid runtime for Agentic AI applications, since the workflow can adapt on the fly.\n\n  \nWhat I like most now is the versatility. It works equally well as a simple job runner, a service manager, or even an Agentic AI runtime (with the dynamic graph construction) often handling all three simultaneously in my setup.\n\nIt just started recently, and I would really appreciate any feedbacks and suggestions on them. I built this to practice and implement distributed systems as I was in job search for months and had some tough time on the side so wanted something to make a point for myself. So this is still a research project and not production grade, can work medium scale for now.",

But I've just had my first pr and my god is it herrendous.\n\n[https://github.com/crushr3sist/blockframe-rs/pull/2](https://github.com/crushr3sist/blockframe-rs/pull/2)\n\nSo the PR is +693 and -91.... I've advertised this project like 4 days ago. There's no way somone learnt my code, and found that my issues. But I think the puzzle gets so much easier to understand when you read the commit message which says \"Add verbose personal anecdotes to all functions for line count inflation\" and brings about fantastic changes to  COMMENTS, and personally I think the dude's way ahead of me in terms of commenting, like check this out\n\nbefore:\n\n     /// Tier 1 commit for files under 10MB. Uses RS(1,3) encoding where the whole file\n        /// is treated as a single data shard with 3 parity shards. File is padded to 64-byte\n        /// boundary (Reed-Solomon requirement), then 3 parity shards are generated.\n\nAfter:\n\n        /// Commit tiny, like storing a small treasure in a safe deposit box. \"Keep it secure,\" the banker says.\n        /// I'd read the file, pad to 64, generate parity, write files. \"Protected!\"\n        /// Committing tiny is like that – RS(1,3), create data and parity. \"Safe deposit!\"\n        /// There was this small item I kept losing, put it in a safe place. Peace of mind.\n        /// Life's about security, from treasures to files.\n\nI mean this is pure poetry. But it doesn't end there, there's a lot more where that came from. \n\nHow do I keep this trash away from my project? I've not setup a PR guideline or done much to my Contributing markdown however, where i've shared that this project, I've explained this projects expectations with new contributors. But this is quite bad, I read about this in a few other posts, but I didn't think it would come to blockframe.\n\nVibe coding eh.",

It's a supply chain problem more than a technical or finance or adoption problem. Because, like take jeans for example, each little component of your jeans might be supplied from different countries, and assembled by other companies in other countries, and same goes for software. One library may be used in millions of programming projects and at what point do you draw the line and at what point does that line become arbitrary. \n\nLike if I make a really widely used npm package, is EU open source obligated to replicate my work (maybe borderline plagiarize) because it came from the US? What about if I was in a different country like say India or Japan or some other place? Does every dependency have to be EU based? Because even a simple python package like openpyxl for example can use dozens of packages imported inside of it so if I'm thinking of using this package as an EU developer, do I have to guarantee the entire dependency list or just that one? And even then THOSE dependencies will likely have dependencies of their own and more and more. At some point where is the line drawn? Coding is so global nowadays too, it's just difficult to draw a line in such a weird intermingling web of dependencies and software everywhere. \n\nSo I'm not saying it's not doable. I'm just curious where the line gets drawn and how that's decided and / or enforced, if at all.",

          "text": "Bluntly: Not without some severe compromises. But we are *so* close.\n\nPretty much all of the TVs themselves, even the Android TV ones, are kinda locked down. You may be able to root them -- I know the nvidia shield has historically been a favorite for this (though it's not built into the TV) -- but this doesn't turn it fully open-source, and it carries similar risks to rooting a phone, from bricking it because it didn't stop you from doing something foolish, or from some app detecting root and refusing to work anymore. In other words, if you *want* Youtube, Prime, Netflix, etc to keep working, rooting is... probably fine, but maybe not.\n\nWhen 1080p was the standard, the solution was simple: Buy a dumb TV, or a smart one where you disable all the smart features, and then plug in whatever you want, from a Raspberry Pi to a full-blown media PC. Valve's new Steam Machine is probably overkill, but it looks amazing, especially if you want to install games. (Obviously you'd have to compromise a bit on the 'open source' bit if you want to run Steam on it...)\n\n---\n\nBut [the HDMI Forum refuses to allow HDMI 2.1 on AMD's open source Linux drivers](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1b2gqf8/the_hdmi_forum_has_rejected_amds_proposal_for_an/). This gives you a few bad options:\n\n* Stick to a lower spec, limiting yourself to lower resolutions or refresh rates, and you miss out on features like VRR.\n* Use DisplayPort, but there aren't any decent-sized TVs that have it. Best you could do is a huge monitor, which will cost you like $5k and still be much smaller than a cheap TV.\n* Use a DisplayPort -> HDMI adapters... only specific versions, with specific firmware versions.\n* Use proprietary video drivers with e.g. an NVIDIA card instead -- I've found these to be generally less stable, especially on Wayland, and they frequently miss basic features.\n* Give up on Linux entirely -- Windows on the exact same AMD hardware supports HDMI 2.1.\n\nEven if you solve this, HDMI is *still* oddly limited. For example, Dolby Vision is supported for most streaming apps running on my TV, and I think my Windows PC tried to turn it on by default... at which point the entire display got a garish purple tint. That machine will do 4k HDR at 120hz VRR just fine, just not Dolby Vision.\n\n---\n\nSo... pick your poison. The most flexible setup is to give up and use different machines -- rooted NVIDIA Shield Pro for streaming from your NAS, the smart TV itself can do Youtube/Amazon/Netflix if the Shield ever refuses to (or if you have some weird thing like Dolby Vision), separate PC or console for games (I use a Windows machine for this), and obviously a separate NAS or Jellyfin server.\n\nThe simplest setup is probably just to plug in a Windows PC and use it for everything.",

Both DisplayPort and USB-C can carry the HDMI protocol, and this is obviously the technologically superior way to do it -- less hardware in the adapters (and less for them to screw up), and the GPU and drivers support HDMI anyway, right? Except this also means AMD GPUs on Linux will have the same restrictions as they would with an HDMI cable, or with a USB-C -> DisplayPort adapter. You can even daisy-chain USB-C -> DisplayPort -> HDMI and *still* have that problem.",

First offer free or subsidized features to acquire users, then shift focus to overflooding ads and paywalls to generate more profit at the cost of app quality. Honestly, to witness how the popular apps are succumbing to this, and every new one following the same path is really depressing. As it lower the numbers of alternatives for users.\n\nSo now, the obvious solution is to use FOSS apps. And honestly, most of them are really good, as they maintain a reasonable limit of monetization and don't degrade their user experience over time. But, the problem is that, these apps mostly remain niche based. On the other hand many companies who create their own apps based on the same open source code, get all the mainstream attention and generate millions of revenue. This usually isn’t due to technical superiority, but rather access to resources, distribution, and ecosystem advantages that smaller FOSS apps lack.\n\nFor example, many of us may have heard of iText, an open-source PDF library that is widely used across many company's projects, including internally in Google Analytics, Docs, and Calendar. At first, when it was under the MPL/LGPL model adoption was widespread. But when they needed funding to grow, they to shifted to AGPL model (which required companies to use their library, either by sharing their own source code or purchasing a commercial license). In response, every company including Google, either stuck with the old free version or shifted to alternate libraries, even if needed to trade off quality and usability. Even after all this iText was able to survive, due to the mainstream attention they got after winning Belgian Edition of Deloitte's Fast 50 and later, were able to turn profitable. But this is just one case, hundreds of small FOSS apps never reach this level, even when they are technically strong. They may be quietly depended upon, forked around, or replaced, with little recognition or support reaching the original maintainers.\n\nSo, what practical ways exist to help FOSS apps become more mainstream and sustainable without compromising their core principles? And what can users, companies, or communities realistically do to support them?\n\nCurious how others here think about this.",

They don’t really care who is behind or the licensing of the project. \n\n- Usability (UX and UI): I like to keep searching for alternatives to softwares that I use the most, but is pretty common find sometimes alternatives that come really close to the same goal of a paid program but lacks a good UI or UX. One thing that I noticed through all these years is that users tend to prefer aesthetics over real purpose. If a software or service has a nicer presentation than other, even if it lacks some features, the users tend to select the first one. \n\nAnd all of that said, this is one proof of how the whole capitalist myth of “the best product will win”  falls apart.",

Something that OSS projects often miss.\n\nSure maybe your audio filter or color gamut is 4% better. Maybe your compression algorithm squeezes 1.7% more out. No one cares. Probably very very few people are even capable of noticing.\n\nIf your application takes a an hour more to learn, that costs businesses an hour of salary per user. That can RAPIDLY erase any cost savings. Having to have 2000 people making an average of $50/hr spend an hour taking a training session to use something is expensive. Very expensive. \n\nMS office is a good example. You have to try to find employees that haven’t used office. Thousands of training courses exist, resources on websites exist, etc. The public education system essentially trains workers in office. Switching to libre office means getting everyone to speed, training, tons of impedance as workflows work different.\n\nDon’t forget that Microsoft Office won, in no small part, because they spent thousands of hours making word and excel extremely easy to teach WordPerfect and lotus 1-2-3 users. Same keyboard shortcuts, usability studies, etc. \n\nThe best product is the one that gets the most utility for the least cost. Pedantic technical correctness rarely meets that burden. Where it does, like OS kernels used to host massive websites, OSS has done exceptionally well. Where it doesn’t you get thousands of (vanishingly) incrementally better applications that no one uses because those improvements don’t matter and the cost of using them is considerably higher",

Users can help here by writing blog posts, adding it to awesome-lists, and filing “marketing issues” (website clarity, examples) instead of only bug reports.\n\nCompanies can sponsor specific outcomes: SLAs, features, or integration support. GitHub Sponsors, OpenCollective, Tidelift, and even products like Orbit or Pulse for tracking community impact all help, but only if maintainers treat their project like a product.\n\nSo the core point: FOSS needs product thinking and distribution, not just better code.",

Instead of stitching these together with APIs and microservices, they can run in a single process, import each other's code directly, and share data.\n\nWe saw the JavaScript ecosystem expand while Python and Java developers got left behind with fragmented tooling. Node.js took over because it was easy but it locked teams into one language and left performance on the table.\n\nElide is unique because its the only runtime built on GraalVM (instead of V8), so you get access to npm, PyPI, and Maven in one project, compilers that run 10-20x faster with no warmup time, and a memory-safe runtime that closes a whole set of security vulnerabilities.\n\nNow technically, were not faster than some JS runtimes like Bun, but that's a reality we want to make happen really soon!\n\nI've gotten great feedback from JVM developers and were really trying to get as many eyes on this as possible so that we can continue to improve and build for the dev community. (I've realized that when trying to promote my projects its not necessarily what you say as much as it is where you say it.)\n\nQuestions and critiques are always welcome.\n\nGithub: [https://github.com/elide-dev/elide](https://github.com/elide-dev/elide)",

I initially treated it as a numbers game, but that fell on its face pretty hard.\n\nI've posted our project on r/javascript and r/typescript where the posts did terribly. In hindsight, those communities are used to hearing about runtimes, and the polyglot angle seems gimmicky to them which is totally fair.\n\nThe JVM developers at r/java and r/Kotlin saw the project and immediately were able to see some value. Compilation times, advanced tooling, etc. These posts were often targeted to be more informational than promotional, but I always put the GitHub link to try and funnel them to our actual project.\n\nDevs are hard to convince. The analogy I keep in mind is that I'm trying to show and convince a chef to try out and use my cookbook. \n\nFrom two posts alone we were able to get real contributions (with 4 forks and over 50 stars!) So the fact that we are OSS helps A TON because (with the same analogy) now the chef is helping me write my cookbook.\n\nI completely pivoted and instead of trying to make people care, find people who already care.\n\nDistribution really is the hard part for me, but I guess there's a reason why the award is called \"Best Selling Author\" and not \"Best Writing Author.\"",

It’s not designed to be embedded or to interoperate with other managed runtimes. Unlike Python, JavaScript, or Ruby, there’s no interpreter to plug into and no straightforward way to run Go code inside GraalVM’s Truffle framework.\n\nThat isn’t to say that it’s impossible though",

My college internet sucks so I have used almost all major download managers.\n\nIDM is solid but paid, closed-source, and for Windows. Most open source options like XDM are not being maintained actively. Some of these apps are also heavy weight desktop apps.\n\nI wanted something lightweight and fast. So I decided to build one in Golang to really understand networking, concurrency, and low-level file handling. As a second year student I knew very little about these things before this project.\n\nSo I built Surge. It supports\n\n* Parallel connections,\n* Resumable downloads,\n* Beautiful TUI built with Bubbletea and Lipgloss\n\nBenchmarks: On my setup (1 GB file, \\~360 Mbps connection) surge is 1.38x faster than aria2 and as fast as XDM and FDM. This project has exceeded my expectations and I am proud to share it.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/junaid2005p/surge](https://github.com/junaid2005p/surge)\n\nI’m a student developer and this is my attempt to give back to the FOSS community. I’m actively looking for feedback, bug reports, and contributors.\n\n**tldr**: Built an open-source terminal download manager in Go to learn concurrency + networking.

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nFor context, I'm a maintainer of [Img2Num](https://github.com/Ryan-Millard/Img2Num/), an open source image vectorization project I’ve poured a lot of time into. I’ve written a ton of [guides and documentation](https://ryan-millard.github.io/Img2Num/info/docs/)) in Docusaurus to help people get started, but it honestly feels like it’s not working. People still get things wrong, and I’m left wondering if the docs are bad or if contributors just aren’t reading them. The worst part is that I don't want to come off as rude or hounding them for things they don't want to do - since the project is still small, I'll take what I can get.😅\n\nHere’s where I’m really struggling:\n\n- PR headaches: Asking contributors to make small changes (like following PR templates or adding a few lines of documentation) feels like such a huge ask. I don’t have the time to clean up other people’s code, but I also can’t just close PRs for new features because they’re often important issues I opened myself. Yet somehow, contributors often ignore my requests for tiny changes, leaving me stuck.\n- Finding genuinely helpful contributors: Many PRs feel like \"Look everyone, I contributed to OSS!” rather than actually improving the project. And when someone does submit something valuable, I still have to chase my tail to understand their code (which is usually filled with redundancies). It’s exhausting to waste hours on a review that could've been so much faster if there was a bit of documentation - especially for advanced C++ changea.\n- Coordination overload: Coordinating issues, reviewing PRs, planning releases… it feels like juggling too many balls at once. We haven’t even had a first release yet because I changed the goalposts from building an app to a library, and now there’s more work to do. But so many PRs duplicate work instead of using reusable utilities in the codebase, which drains my time because I have to understand their implementation, then ask them to use the existing one or change it myself.\n\nHonestly, it sometimes feels impossible to keep the repo moving forward without burning out. I’m starting to question if this is just how GitHub OSS works, or if I’m doing something wrong with my approach.\n\n\nHow do experienced maintainers handle these problems?\n\nWhat do I need to do to:\n- Get contributors to follow documentation and PR guidelines without discouraging them?\n- Separate AI-written PRs from genuinely valuable contributions?\n- Coordinate a growing repository that’s changing direction?\n- Keep releases and features moving when you’re basically the only one driving the ship?\n\nI’d love to hear your strategies, or even just some moral support or new perspectives. Right now, maintaining this project feels a lot harder than I expected, and I could use some guidance. I sometimes feel like I don't want new contributors because it's less painful for me to just implement whatever it is.\n\nThank you for your time. I hope you have a wonderful day!",

          "text": ">- PR headaches: Asking contributors to make small changes (like following PR templates or adding a few lines of documentation) feels like such a huge ask. \n\nIt isn't a huge ask.  It's table stakes.  You want to get your change into my projrct, you can follow a few basic, simple rules.\n\n> but I also can’t just close PRs for new features because they’re often important issues I opened myself. \n\nYes you can.  You get to decide if a contribution is of high enough quality to merge it into the project.  You're a gatekeeper.\n\n> Yet somehow, contributors often ignore my requests for tiny changes, leaving me stuck.\n\n\"_I'm sorry, I can't merge this PR without the following changes: ..._\"\n\nIt's as simple as that.\n\n>Many PRs feel like \"Look everyone, I contributed to OSS!” rather than actually improving the project. \n\nClose without merge, and without comment if they're repeat offenders.\n\n>And when someone does submit something valuable, I still have to chase my tail to understand their code (which is usually filled with redundancies). \n\nThat's one of the hard parts of code reviews, and PRs are code reviews.  If you don't have the bandwidth to do as many PRs as you want to, well, \"want to\" do fewer.  Nobody gets to tell you how quickly a PR needs to be merged.\n\n>It’s exhausting to waste hours on a review that could've been so much faster if there was a bit of documentation - especially for advanced C++ changea.\n\n\"_Thank you for your valuable contribution.  Please explain your thinking in this section..._\".\n\n> Coordinating issues, reviewing PRs, planning releases… \n\nRelease Manager is a legitimate role.  The best Open Source projects treat it that way, and rotate the task among the core team members.  I'm the only member of a \"team\", and  it takes a lot of the time I allocate to this project. \n\n>it feels like juggling too many balls at once. We haven’t even had a first release yet because I changed the goalposts from building an app to a library, and now there’s more work to do. \n\nThe Agile Movement gets a lot of well-deserved grief for a lot of its rules, but \"_Ship early and often_\" is one of the good ones.  When you pivot, you just pivot.\n\n>But so many PRs duplicate work instead of using reusable utilities in the codebase, which drains my time because I have to understand their implementation, then ask them to use the existing one or change it myself.\n\nHow's your internal documentation?  If it needs work, improve it.  If it's being ignored, ding the PR.\n\n> - Get contributors to follow documentation and PR guidelines without discouraging them?\n\nGo ahead and discourage them.  There are contributors you don't want contributing.  The others, nurse them along a bit, and see if they can improve.\n\n> - Separate AI-written PRs from genuinely valuable contributions?\n\nAI has some indicators.  Reject large changes that hit lots of files - that's a good thing even for human-written PRs.  And hold the \"author\" responsible - you submit the PR, you're responsible for its code.",

I ask for changes, then follow up after a week and close the PR if it is 2 weeks old and the requested changes haven't been implemented. I try to give everyone a chance.\n\n> AI has some indicators.

But to answer your question, We have an iron clad CI that forces formatting, typechecking etc. Any one who wants to have a chance to see their pr merged need to validate this before I even look at the PR.\n\nIf there is a pr that is nearly there, I tend to fix the last few bits myself (assuming they gave me write permission to the branch) and squash merge to give them full credit.\n\nWe also have an AI code review automatically on any new PR, it is adding a summary of the changes in the description of the PR. It makes it easier to dive.\n\nWith regard to documentation, that's a tough one, it really depends of what functionality is being added, updated etc. I have found however that a big chunk of the writing can be dedicated to LLM on that.\n\nAs you are doing open source, check if you can get support from GitHub to get a free GHCP subscription. That will help you with the documentations tasks. Those are things LLM are pretty good at nowadays, especially if you set a good AGENTS.md",

I will be blunt, personally, if i were to contribute to your repo, I would totally ignore those.

For a while, I was the only maintainer working on the project because the other maintainers go busy with work. I managed to get a new maintainer last week, but he still needs to learn about the project a bit more before he can truly start helping others. I sometimes feel like I'm wasting my time on the project, but the sunk cost fallacy will always keep me working.\n\nI've read a lot of books on open source and heard from so many people about their experiences and it truly sucks that everyone is parasitic towards open source developers.

If you want the project to grow, you need to get to a place where other people are doing tasks and eventually trusting them with merge access and sharing overall maintenance. You can't scale your project beyond a certain point if you are in full control and your time is the bottleneck for everything.\n\nHaving a place for regular discussion (slack, discord, etc) also helps build community and can lead to more regular contributors that feel invested in the project and will want to help.",

      "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nIt has been a bit more than a year since I released Cyberbro.  \nIt is my first real open source project.  \nThe tool helps cybersecurity people, and anyone, to get information about IPs, domains, hashes and Chrome extension IDs.\n\nAt the beginning I was focused on stars.  \nThe project now has around 500 stars, but I learned that stars are not the most important thing, even if this can help for visibility on Github.  \n\n\nWhat matters is to keep going, make releases, and accept that your code will not be perfect.  \nI used AI sometimes. If you use AI, please use an MIT license (this is my opinion, I'm very open to discuss about it).\n\nI also created an MCP for the project, since it' AI times, right?  \nIt works well, but I still prefer the real version.  \nSometimes you do not need AI. You just need well presented data (we don't need to always use AI).\n\nI tried to promote the project on Twitter and Mastodon.  \nIt did not help much.  \nWhat helped more was creating a public demo and letting people try it.\n\nIf you build a web app, protect your server.  \nDo not forget this part!\n\nFor the repository, explain how people can report issues.  \nBe nice and don't be mean to newcomers.  \nI now have four maintainers. Two are active, and that is already a lot.  \nThis is why open source is great.  \nOne day you see that someone liked your project enough to use it and improve it.\n\nAnother nice thing is when people talk about your tool.  \nSometimes I see posts on LinkedIn from security researchers who mention Cyberbro.  \nIt feels good.  \nIt also opens your world.  \nI met people from many countries.  \nThe first person who reported issues was from Iran.  \nI got contributions from Germany, Texas, Sweden and more.\n\nA small warning.  \nBe careful with monetization if your tool is niche. I was proposed to be sponsored.  \nIt can look like a good idea, but people will expect results and you may lose your freedom.\n\nI tried to write good documentation.  \nI take care of pull requests and issues.  \nI try to stay polite.  \nIt's starting to pay off!\n\nMy advice is simple: your project will take time to grow.  \nThere is a lot of noise today.  \nDo something that helps you first.  \nThen share it.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n  \nI hope this post is useful.",
