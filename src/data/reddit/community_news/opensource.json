Then I we add a few custom labels and or have some alternative interfaces to it that make the work easier. \n\nIf our work was not connected to the infrastructure, I've used Roundup ( [https://www.roundup-tracker.org](https://www.roundup-tracker.org) ) even longer than Jira, and I was very happy with it, despite how extremely old it is and would likely be looking at it as a first pass.\n\nIf you're not doing tickets, but software building, what in your existing forge is not working for you?

      "text": "A few years ago, I had an idea for an open-source project that I'd like to exist, to help people with severe dementia and their caregivers.  I have pretty much none of the skills that would be helpful in making it happen.  I have a few decades of programming experience, but none in software architecture, and at present my health problems limit my ability to learn major new skills.  I'm throwing this idea out here, basically in the hope that it gets the attention of someone who can do something with it.\n\nBackground: my wife has several serious health problems, and has spent a lot of time in hospitals.  Frequently, when I visit her there, I can hear people with dementia yelling from other rooms: they don't understand where they are, they're confused, they want someone to help them *now*.  Apart from their own distress, they're upsetting other patients and visitors, and it takes a toll on the caregivers as well.\n\nIn one hospital stay, my wife was sharing a room with an extremely frail, elderly woman.  She was barely moving, apart from talking incessantly: \"Margaret?  Is my oxygen on?  Are you there?  Is my oxygen okay?  Margaret?\"  Occasionally a nurse would come in and reassure her that her oxygen was fine, and that would settle her... for about five minutes.  And then she would start again, because she couldn't hold the thought.\n\nIt occurred to me that what she really could use was an automated system that could listen for her to say the word \"oxygen\", and tell her in the voice of Margaret (whoever that was!) something like \"Your oxygen is fine.  You're safe, in the hospital.\"\n\nThe logic of such a system wouldn't need to be any more complex than what the old \"Eliza\" program did.  Check for keywords, spit out a recorded response.  It would be complicated by difficulty in training it, given the non-ideal conditions for sound pickup and that many such patients don't enunciate well.  It would be simplified by not necessarily even having to do full speech-to-text; merely being able to recognize sound patterns (e.g. vowel pattern \"aw-ih-eh\" for \"oxygen\") might suffice.  It wouldn't even have to generate its own speech, since it could simply play canned messages recorded by someone.  Margaret, whoever that was...  (I'll admit to having had thoughts of \"Are you there, Margaret?  It's me, God.\")\n\nMy wife is a dementia specialist, and she thinks that something like this would be extremely beneficial towards \"reorienting\" people with severe dementia.  I've asked a few hospital nurses, and they love the idea.  I've discussed the concept with a friend who was a linguistics expert with Dragon Naturally Speaking, and he agrees with my assessments of the problems.\n\nMy impression is that this shouldn't require especially powerful hardware.  I'd like the thing to be freely available, since medical costs are high; it ought to be able to run on something like a relatively-old mobile device.  I don't want it locked down to a particular platform, or owned by some company for profit.\n\nIs there some way that this can happen?",

      "text": "Hi,\n\nAround two months ago, I submitted a Feature Request and a PR to a repository that had a GPL-3.0 license. The PR was rejected because it conflicted with a feature of another project of the author. He explicitly marked the FR as \"not planned\". I’ve told him that I’ll continue with this change in a fork. He wasn’t objecting to that. After that, during a period of roughly two months, I added a couple of unique features and was frequently merging upstream into my fork (merging also became more difficult with time). And because I put quite a lot of effort into the fork, also complying with the GPL-3.0 license, I started to think about making a public release. I’ve reached out to the author to see what he was thinking about it. I’ve tried to be friendly, but the farther the discussion went, the stranger his behavior became. At first, he said that he had stabilized his features, and now we can work together on merging my fork. I asked him to give me a day or two to think about it because I’ve put a lot of effort into the fork, and still prefer to publish. Then he told that he will change his license from GPL-3.0 (which gives permission to publish) to one that requires explicit permission from the author. I agreed and said that I will respect it and won’t merge the upstream repo into mine. And he did update the license, and I’ve merged till the latest GPL-3.0 commit, updated the readme, and renamed my repository.\n\nBut quickly he changed his mind and started objecting to me making the public release, also saying that he will implement all features that I have in his repo, and put all efforts to prevent my fork from going public.\n\nI can relate to his feelings partially, but he chose GPL-3.0 in the first place. Before even submitting the first PR, I’ve carefully considered the license terms, because I knew that if I made a PR and the author decide to reject it, then I can continue working on the fork and even publish it later. And with this assumption in mind, I implemented several features in the fork and fixed a couple of bugs. I wouldn’t make a single modification to the source repo if not GPL-3.0.  \n  \nWhat would you suggest? How is it usually handled? I’m a single developer and don’t want to deal with legal staff (though I always followed the license terms and tried to be respectful to the original repository's efforts, never claiming credit for what was implemented there).",

He uses AI-assisted workflow (as he calls it), and I don't like it's code quality (though, it's not bad, I've seen worth).",

It means even if a plugin is developed using a license that grants publishing rights (like GPL-3.0), Obsidian won't accept any forked versions until some conditions are met. For example, an explicit permission from the author is required if the upstream plugin is in active development (GPL-3.0 grants rights to publish without requiring an explicit permission). The [developer policy](https://docs.obsidian.md/Developer+policies) on their website is not yet updated and still uses open-source licensing terms, and it doesn’t explicitly states whether a fork is allowed to publish or not. Quote: \"Include a LICENSE file and clearly indicate the license of your plugin or theme.\"\n\nNotably, seems like even Apple's App Store allows publishing if the forked app follows the license. Is such a change acceptable from the open source perspective? What are your thoughts?\n\n[Source](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/840286264964022302/1455281698345324687)\n\nDisclaimer: The OP is not affiliated with the Obsidian team in any way.",

Because some owners of the original repos were objecting to publishing even when their licence in the repository allows it. But once again, I'm not affiliated with the Obsidian team.",

Ask them if they have any other reasons for not allowing a fork that a) preserves license, b) gives credit to original team/copyright holders.  Any other reasons than the ones they gave already. It smells of **arbitrary decision** which I am triggered by more than other ppl.\n\nOther questions:\n\n1. Does Obsidian pass any of its revenue to the plugin makers?  Could there be a quiet assurance to those that they will not allow forks.\n\n2. Do Obsidian Inc ever kick plugins from being listed for reasons of viability?  Sure they can kick because they belatedly discover the plugin is stealthy-malware that's otherwise convincing as a plugin - and [forks are statistically more likely to be those than originals](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/auto-draft-275/). \n\nOn that last - in package-land generally (Npm, maven-central, apt, brew, etc etc) - I think the repo maintainers are going to have to pivot to owning the compilation-and-package step even if don't provide test-automation capability.  That would also include plugin-registries like Obsidian's (but also Chrome's extensions and alike).",

You pretend like enthusiastic developers working on their free time is the one and only thing keeping open source software alive, when really what *actually* keeps it alive is a shared common interest in it staying alive. Huge donations from corporations who depend on the project as well as labour from workers in said corporations who maintain it for them, or corporations like canonical and redhat who fund themselves through providing round the clock support to customers, usually businesses. Free software isn't unpaid labour, it's labour everyone benefits from.\n\n2- Be reasonable, \"fair source\" is an absolute joke. Not only is it an extremely vague and exploitable concept (\"minimal restrictions\" can be whatever anyone says it is), it's also just... fundamentally flawed, if a project was publicly available to read or even only available to read after buying a copy, you'd get at most a handful of customers before someone leaks it on piracy websites and everyone else gets it for free. This is the exact reason why corporations don't *create* open source software, they only maintain it: There's no point in monetizing or restricting something you make open under certain circumstances, since that will inevitably lead to leaks that will make it fully open whether you like it or not.",

With many open-source projects, you rely on community goodwill, which can be inconsistent.\n\nSecond, quality and maintenance vary. Some projects are fantastic, but others are abandoned, poorly documented, or lack long-term updates. That creates real risk if you depend on them for critical systems.\n\nThird, developers and companies sometimes need control.

You own your infrastructure.\n\n\nSecurity through Transparency: The idea that 'public code is more vulnerable' is a myth. In Linux, thousands of eyes constantly review the code (Linus's Law). Security patches are usually released in hours, not months like in closed systems.\n\n\nWorld-Class Support: As mentioned in a comment above, for the enterprise environment, there are giants like Red Hat (IBM), SUSE, and Canonical that offer professional support even more robust than Microsoft's. And for the average user, the community provides the most extensive documentation in the world.\n\n\nEfficiency and Customization: Linux allows you to remove everything you don't need.\n\n\nThat's why it dominates 100% of the world's supercomputers and almost the entire server and cloud market.\n\n\nYou don't pay for bloatware or unnecessary telemetry.\n\n\nUltimately, resistance to open source usually stems from fear of change or prior investment in closed ecosystems (vendor lock-in), not from a lack of technical quality.\n\nAnd that's why I'm looking to create a large and united community in the Linux sector, to get together, learn from each other, and raise awareness about Linux and free software.

The only reason we need open source is to protect innovation from IP.\n\nIn the US, we need to convince Congress to pass a Constitutional amendment to repeal the IP clause (article I, section 8, clause 8) and replace it with one that secures, for all artists and inventors, a right to be recognized for their ideas, but excludes ideas from the definition of 'property'.

If you build an entire business around a project you're not funding, you're only killing your golden goose if you don't make that project's development part of your budget.\n\n\"If you're not paying for it, you're not the customer\" should also apply to open source development.\n\nI'm not sure a business like that could scale if they have no one to maintain the free thing they're using because of burnout. Pay that guy for patches or development and you get to ensure that it's still maintained. Hire more devs, grow the infrastructure for it and ensure that the service is robust because the backend is robust.\n\nedit: Actually I'm pretty sure FANG already contributes a lot to open source development, both with their own projects and by funding existing ones. It's an easy way to find new talent, ensure long term service health, and reduce the cost of R&D as integral services can be co-developed by several companies.",

      "text": "It's been two years since Rote was born. I've developed and refactored countless versions, and as of writing this article, there are already 860 commits. It has grown alongside me.\n\n# Background\n\nRegarding the birth of Rote, I won't shy away from saying that the inspiration came from the open-source project [usememos](https://usememos.com/). Earlier, I was a loyal user of usememos and even created an open-source mini-program client for usememos ([memos\\_wmp](https://github.com/Rabithua/memos_wmp)). However, I gradually felt that the project became bloated and complex, diverging more from my note-taking needs.\n\nSo I started developing [Rote](https://github.com/Rabithua/Rote) from scratch. The web version's interface and interaction design drew more inspiration from designs I liked on Twitter and the Tailwindcss website, achieving what I believe is a smooth and elegant responsive design.\n\nAlthough there's an explore page and Reactions, I don't define it as a community. The explore page simply displays some users' public notes, just like I often make public some content I find interesting. Essentially, it's a side effect of the public notes feature.\n\nFor me, public notes are a way for people interested in me to quickly understand what I'm doing or what I'm interested in (you should know that after registering an account, everyone gets a public personal page, similar to my [personal homepage](https://beta.rote.ink/rabithua), like Telegram's Channel. I personally think it can also be used as a blog. Several years ago, I lost the energy to frequently write long-form content, so these note snippets are perfect—no pressure to write).\n\n# Rote's Core Design Philosophy\n\n* **Stay Restrained** \\- Everything for an elegant note-taking experience and restrained interaction\n* **Low Mental Burden** \\- Less pressure and a simpler, more intuitive recording experience, even deployment experience\n* **Open Interface** \\- Open API interfaces, supporting recording or retrieving data in any scenario\n* **Unrestricted** \\- Complete control over your data, free to export data\n\n# Supported Features\n\n* **Self-Hosted** **Server** and **Web** (frontend-backend separation design)\n* Simple deployment experience, quick start via `Docker compose` or `Dokploy` template [Deployment Documentation](https://beta.rote.ink/doc/selfhosted)\n* [iOS Client](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rote/id6755513897) supports any **self-hosted instance** (defaults to my hosted site, can switch to your own instance by clicking the welcome text in the top-left corner of the login page multiple times)\n* Smooth web **responsive design** and immersive **PWA** support\n* **OAuth** support, currently supports `GitHub` and `Apple Login`, `Google` is planned\n* **RSS** support, similar to [RSS subscription](https://api.rote.ink/v2/api/rss/rabithua) you can subscribe to my updates\n* **Reactions** anonymous users or logged-in users can react to their own or others' public notes\n* **S3** storage support, defaults to `Cloudflare R2` storage, configuration can be skipped\n* **Explore Page** to display all users' public note content on the site\n* **Note tags**, **archive status**, **visibility status**, **attachments**\n* Basic components: **heatmap**, **tag cloud**, **random review**, and **search** support\n* **OpenKey** with permission control for partial use of selected capabilities (e.g., adding notes directly via `GET` requests)\n* **Admin Dashboard** including site settings, storage settings, interface settings, user management, security settings, OAuth login\n* Experimental features: **Service Worker** notifications (I want Rote to achieve instant notifications similar to `Bark`), **data export**, `EveryDayOneCat` widget 🐱\n* **Public note direct link sharing** [Example Note](https://beta.rote.ink/rote/ad7c6701-d6de-4de0-9fe6-f89258db9da7), your **public personal homepage** [Rabithua](https://beta.rote.ink/rabithua)\n* **Multi-language support** Chinese / English\n\n# iOS Client Features\n\n* Basic **note features** (**Create, Read, Update, Delete**)\n* **Personal information** and **personal homepage**\n* **Explore page** (can see others' interesting public content and add **Reactions**)\n* **Generate note sharing image** (long press on note)\n* **Customize interface display** (text weight and size, whether to show avatars, color theme preference, whether to enable haptic feedback)\n* **Statistics page** (current note data accumulation is poor, future client will focus on this)\n* Several intuitive **widgets** (**Recent Notes**, **Random Note**, **Heatmap**)\n* **Shortcuts**, manually trigger shortcuts after copying content to quickly record notes (currently unstable, may have issues in different language environments or special content situations)\n* **Search notes** by `tag`/`visibility`/`archived status`/`time`/`keyword`\n* Very smooth **timeline view**\n* **Multi-language support** Simplified Chinese / Traditional Chinese / English / Japanese / Korean\n* **iOS** intuitive **native interaction experience**\n* Cute unknown creature with grass on its head\n* Unknown **Easter eggs**\n\nThe Rote iOS client is currently not open source. I'm ashamed to say that due to financial constraints, I'm considering making the Rote client a paid project to make a living (currently still free to download). If one day I'm no longer worried about making a living, I'll open source it.\n\n**Get Started >>** [**Demo**](https://demo.rote.ink/) ｜ [**Github**](https://github.com/Rabithua/Rote) ｜ [**Website**](https://rote.ink) ｜ [**iOS APP**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rote/id6755513897) ｜ [**Explore**](https://rote.ink/explore) ｜ [**Rabithua**](https://rote.ink/rabithua)",

I used to rely on *DFInstagram* to block the endless scroll, but it hasn't been maintained for a long time and updating it to newer Instagram versions was a pain.\n\nSo I decided to build my own solution: **FeurStagram** \\- an open-source project that removes Instagram's addictive features while keeping the essentials (for Android).\n\nThe FeurStagram repo is on Github : [https://github.com/jean-voila/FeurStagram](https://github.com/jean-voila/FeurStagram)\n\n# Two ways to use it:\n\n* **Ready-to-install APK :** Just grab the latest patched APK from the GitHub releases and install it. No technical skills needed! DIY Patching Toolkit. You can install the apk file from here : [feurstagram-410-1-0-63-71.apk](https://github.com/jean-voila/FeurStagram/releases/download/v410-1-0-63-71/feurstagram-410-1-0-63-71.apk)\n* You can also patch any Instagram version yourself using the included scripts\n\n# What gets blocked:\n\n* ❌ Feed posts (blocked at network level)\n* ❌ Explore tab (redirects to DMs)\n* ❌ Reels tab (redirects to DMs)\n\n# What still works:\n\n* ✅ Stories\n* ✅ Direct Messages\n* ✅ Profile\n* ✅ Reels shared in DMs (so you can still view what friends send you, but can't scroll)\n* ✅ Search\n* ✅ Notifications Why this approach? Unlike DFInstagram which stopped being updated:\n\n**Pre-built APKs available** \\- just download and install from releases\n\n**DIY option -** if you want a specific Instagram version, you can patch it yourself\n\n**Future-proof -** when Instagram updates, I'll release the new patched version (or you can patch it yourself)\n\n**I**t's open source, you can see exactly what it does. no shady modifications, just blocks unwanted content\n\n# The toolkit uses two patching strategies:\n\n* **Network-level blocking -** intercepts Instagram's API calls and blocks feed content at the source\n* **Tab redirection -** when you tap Explore or Reels, it opens DMs instead The result: Instagram becomes purely a communication tool. You can still message friends, view their stories, check notifications, and use your profile. But no more doomscrolling through the feed, no explore rabbit holes, no endless reels.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts and feedback.\n\n",

      "text": "Hi [r/opensource](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/),\n\nI am releasing v0.4.0 of **Mindwtr**, a project aiming to bring modern UX to the open-source productivity space.\n\nMost \"modern\" to-do apps are closed-source SaaS products. The open-source alternatives often lack mobile apps or polished UIs. Mindwtr attempts to bridge that gap.\n\n**The Philosophy:**\n\n* **Your Data:** Stored locally in accessible formats (JSON).\n* **No Vendor Lock-in:** You can uninstall the app and keep your data.\n* **Sync Agnostic:** Designed to work with Syncthing, Nextcloud, or standard file syncing.\n\n**Tech Stack:**\n\n* **Frontend:** React / TypeScript\n* **Desktop Wrapper:** Tauri (Rust) for performance and security.\n* **Mobile:** React Native / Expo.\n\nIt is licensed under MIT/AGPL. I would love contributions, especially from anyone with experience in local-first data synchronization (CRDTs vs. Last-Write-Wins).\n\n**Repository:** [https://github.com/dongdongbh/Mindwtr](https://github.com/dongdongbh/Mindwtr)",

Jellyfin and Plex are OK for music but Jellyfin is finnicky AF and the Plex app for some reason doesn't send a keep-awake signal when listening to music so my TV will shut off. Just frustration after frustration.\n\nI've seen tons of posts on here asking for a FOSS music app like Spotify and have searched for that myself. Lidify is my answer to that. And yes, I regret the name since this turned into much more than a Lidarr frontend. Here's what's available now (with bugs I'm sure):\n\n* **Vibe System:** You ever listen to a song that just hits different in the moment? You don't know exactly what it is, you just know you're absolutely feeling it and then go on a journey trying to find other songs that give you that same feeling but come up empty? The vibe system is my solution to that. It analyzes tracks using data from MusicBrainz and [Last.fm](http://Last.fm) paired with ML analysis through Essentia. It'll be a forever work in progress but it works pretty well already.\n* **Made For You playlists** (era mixes, genre mixes, rediscover tracks you haven't played in a while)\n* **Discover Weekly** that actually downloads recommendations if you have Lidarr and/or Soulseek set up\n* **Spotify/Deezer playlist import** (also dependent on Lidarr + Soulseek)\n* **Podcasts via RSS**\n* **Audiobookshelf integration**\n* **Multi user with 2FA**\n\nPWA works on mobile, native app coming later.\n\nThis is a passion project I built for myself but I'd love input and feature ideas from everyone. GPL-3.0, so fork it, break it, make it your own.\n\n[https://github.com/Chevron7Locked/lidify/](https://github.com/Chevron7Locked/lidify/)\n\n  \nScreenshots in repo:\n\n[https://github.com/Chevron7Locked/lidify/blob/main/assets/screenshots/desktop-home.png](https://github.com/Chevron7Locked/lidify/blob/main/assets/screenshots/desktop-home.png)",

I'd like to start by apologising for how some people here have responded to this post (they think this subreddit is dedicated only to them, which makes them angry when they see people with similar problems post about their problems). It isn't very nice, and it makes getting help very challenging. \n\nHere are my recommendations:\n1. Follow this subreddit - a lot of people post their projects here, and you may find one that excites you.\n2. Follow subreddits and other similar social media groups that post about things you're interested in.\n3. Ask this question elsewhere and maybe here again in a month or two if you don't find somewhere that you'd like to contribute.\n4. Consider any packages you currently use and see if there are any issues that seem doable on their repository.\n\nIt isn't easy to find someone else's project to work on because that requires advertising on their part, which can be tough.\n\nIf you're interested, I have an OSS project ([Img2Num](https://github.com/Ryan-Millard/Img2Num/)) that is relatively new (no releases yet) and open to beginners and new contributors who would like to shape the repository. It uses C++ compiled to WebAssembly (so we have no backend) to convert any image into a color-by-number template that allows users to color their image directly in their browser.\n\nDon't lose hope! You will find the perfect project soon. Happy New Year!🥳✨️",

      "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nWe’re working on **PushFlow**, an open-source, standalone real-time push notification framework built with a microservice architecture.\n\nPushFlow is designed to handle notification requests through a gateway service, route them using a dispatcher, and deliver them in real time through dedicated delivery services (such as WebSockets or SSE). The focus is on keeping responsibilities clear, communication asynchronous, and the system easy to self-host and extend.\n\nThe stack is intentionally straightforward: NestJS with TypeScript, Docker for local and production setups, Redis for event coordination, and MongoDB for persistence. The goal is to provide a clean and understandable foundation for real-time notification delivery, without being tied to a specific application or platform.\n\nWe’re publishing the project in the open from the start and would really appreciate feedback on the architecture, design decisions, and overall direction. If you’re interested in real-time systems, distributed services, or notification infrastructure, we’d love to hear your thoughts.\n\nMore updates and the repository coming soon.\n\nGitHub link: [https://github.com/pyankie/pushflow](https://github.com/pyankie/pushflow)",

There is also [novu](https://novu.co/) which is probably closer to what you're trying to build, which is already open source and built on top of nestjs btw, so maybe a combination of the two platforms is the sweetspot.",

With enough time I can match your personal box and your spam box together and it would take just a bit of effort. This is called fingerprinting. Also, account access for an account that is left open for a service can create an issue where the attacker can gain access to the actual email, depending on how you do things like passwords and such. Further, most people create their spam email with their main email as a backup. This is just a nice little back door for an attacker because you likely got lazy and forgot about it.

ADC uses a documented, straightforward format (8-byte header + compressed file blocks) and aims to stay readable even years down the line.\n\nKey points:\n\n* Open-source > GPLv3\n* Made in Python with zlib\n* Custom, documented archive format\n* Multiple files per archive\n* Focus on clarity over cleverness\n* Linux-first, but cross-platform\n\nThis is very much a hobby project, but it’s actively maintained and still evolving.  \nIf you’re into:\n\nsimple tools\n\nopen formats\n\nlearning through open source\n\nor just reviewing weird archive ideas 😄\n\nfeedback and contributions are very welcome. Even comments or criticism are appreciated.\n\nGithub:  \n[https://github.com/Mealman1551/ArchivedDataCodec]()\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nps.\n\nMy intentions are not to develop an industry standard but just a hobby project",

TAR is one of the most famous archive formats out there, is famously uncompressed (but is also aimed at use with tape media with very slow seek times, as you're maximising for simplicity you can dispense with that requirement).\n\n\nYour fixed-size header implies fixed-size file size/offset fields. I know you only mentioned long-term _readability_ but what about long-term _writability?_ I know 2⁶⁴ bytes'-worth of data is **super-huge mega _ULTRA-big_** and unlikely to be maxed out by contemporary storage demands for a while, but, in the history of computing I think we have a tendency to underestimate the growth rate of capacity demands within our systems (we've already practically run out of IPv4 addresses!). Consider support (in-principle) in your format for unbounded file sizes. You don't necessarily need to support it functionally in your implementation, but a file format designed to last _years_ and with a focus on longevity could benefit from this capability being future-proofed into its metadata structure.",

As for security, Aegis has at-rest encryption as well as encrypted backups, whereas FreeOTP+ doesn't seem to do so (makes some assumptions about device-level security). As far as migration, Aegis supports importing from a wide range of authenticator apps, including FreeOTP and FreeOTP+.\n\nAll that said, Aegis's UI is waaay better, and it has way more features than what I can see in FreeOTP+. You could always try exporting and importing into Aegis, testing that it works, play around and see if you like it, and only then remove FreeOTP+.",

We currently use yunohost for account management. But it's for the future of course, as long as this works, it'd be already great.\n* For storage, we use Nextcloud, so it'd be nice if it could integrate with that somehow, but it's not very important. Sharing storage on the same server is enough.\n\nI'll try to find some time to test this during downtime in a few months (we're unfortunately extremely busy)",
