      "text": "So in case you missed it, Google is requiring every app developer to register with them, pay a fee, hand over government ID, and upload their signing keys just so their app can be installed on your phone. Even apps that have nothing to do with the Play Store. This starts September 2026.\n\nF-Droid apps, random useful tools from GitHub, a student testing their own app on their own damn phone, all of that gets blocked unless the developer goes through Google first. And they keep saying \"sideloading isn't going away\" while their own official page literally says all apps from unverified developers will be blocked on certified devices. That's every phone running Google services so basically every Android phone out there.\n\nAnd the best part is that the Play Store is already full of scam apps and malware that passes right through their \"verification\". But sure, let's punish indie devs and hobbyists instead.\n\nThe keepandroidopen.org project lays out the full picture and has actual steps you can take, filling out Google's own feedback survey, contacting regulators, etc. If you don't trust random links just search \"Keep Android Open\" and you'll find it.\n\nSeriously, if you care about this at all, now is the time to make noise about it before it's too late.\n\n-------\n\n**Update!**\nSome fair corrections from the comments. To be precise, Google has stated in their FAQ that they are building an \"advanced flow\" that will allow experienced users to install unverified apps after going through a series of warnings. So it's not a total block with zero options.\n\nThat said, two things worth noting. First, the FAQ and the official policy page are not the same thing. The policy page still states, without any exceptions or asterisks, that all apps must be from verified developers to be installed on certified devices. The advanced flow is mentioned only in the FAQ section, and described as something they are \"building\" and \"gathering feedback on\". These two pages currently contradict each other, and we don't know which one reflects the final reality.\n\nSecond one is that we have no idea what \"high-friction flow\" actually means in practice. It could be two extra taps. It could be something so buried and discouraging that most people give up. Google themselves describe it as designed to \"resist\" user action. Until someone can actually test it, we're trusting a description.\n\nF-Droid's concern (and the reason I made this post) isn't that their apps will be technically impossible to install. It's that their developers are anonymous volunteers who won't register with Google, their apps will be labeled as \"unverified\", and over time the ecosystem slowly dies from friction and lost trust. F-Droid themselves said this could end their project. These are not my words, this is what the F-Droid team itself thinks.\n\nPressure is what got Google to announce the bypass in the first place. Therefore, we must not stop and make sure that the market is not completely captured by them alone",

              "text": "Here my message to the switzerland relevant entity:\n\n```\nGuten Tag\n\nich möchte Sie auf eine geplante Änderung in Googles Android-Betriebssystem aufmerksam machen, die aus meiner Sicht eine erhebliche Einschränkung des freien Wettbewerbs und eine Missachtung der Wahlfreiheit von Konsumenten darstellt.\nSachverhalt:\nGoogle plant (voraussichtlich ab September 2026), die Installation von Anwendungen, die nicht über den offiziellen Google Play Store bezogen werden (sog. „Sideloading“), massiv zu erschweren. Entwickler sollen dazu verpflichtet werden, sich mit amtlichen Dokumenten bei Google zu registrieren und Gebühren zu entrichten, damit ihre Apps auf zertifizierten Android-Geräten überhaupt lauffähig sind – selbst wenn diese Apps nicht im Play Store angeboten werden.\n\nWettbewerbsrelevante Problematik:\nMarkteintrittsbarrieren für unabhängige Akteure: Durch die Registrierungspflicht und die damit verbundenen Hürden werden insbesondere Open-Source-Projekte (wie F-Droid), Hobby-Entwickler und kleinere Unternehmen benachteiligt. Diese Akteure bieten oft innovative Nischenprodukte an, die im direkten Wettbewerb zu Googles eigenen Diensten stehen könnten.\n\nErzwungene Zentralisierung: \nIndem Google sich als „Gatekeeper“ für alle auf der Hardware installierbaren Programme positioniert, hebelt das Unternehmen die Offenheit des Android-Systems aus. Dies führt zu einer Monopolstellung bei der Software-Verteilung.\n\nAbschreckung durch „High-Friction-Flows“: \nZwar stellt Google einen „erweiterten Pfad“ für erfahrene Nutzer in Aussicht, beschreibt diesen jedoch selbst als einen Prozess, der „Nutzeraktionen widerstehen“ soll. Solche künstlichen Hürden (Dark Patterns) dienen dazu, Nutzer in Googles eigenem Ökosystem zu halten und Drittanbieter-Marktplätze sowie direkte Downloads wirtschaftlich unattraktiv zu machen.\n\nGefährdung der Privatsphäre und Anonymität: \nDie Pflicht zur Preisgabe von Regierungs-IDs gegenüber einem privaten US-Unternehmen für die blosse Bereitstellung von Software ist unverhältnismässig und schliesst anonyme, gemeinnützige Entwicklungsgemeinschaften faktisch aus.\n\nIn einer digitalisierten Schweiz ist es essenziell, dass Endgeräte neutral bleiben und der Zugang zum Markt für Software-Entwickler nicht von den Bedingungen eines einzelnen Plattformbetreibers abhängt.\n\nIch bitte Sie daher, diese Entwicklungen im Rahmen Ihrer Marktbeobachtung zu prüfen und zu untersuchen, ob hier ein Missbrauch einer marktbeherrschenden Stellung gemäss Kartellgesetz vorliegt.\n\nFür Rückfragen stehe ich Ihnen gerne zur Verfügung.\nFreundliche Grüsse\n```",

There are improvements they could make here:  Graphene removes unused permissions from apps, so the browser looses the install apps permissions.\n\nIf they add a seperate tighter permission level, the there are other permission that really should be locked down equally tightly, like the system settings and preferences ones, all files access, and even wifi control, since it leaks location data.",

Those aren't the same people pushing EIDs. The regulatory landscape isn't one monolith, there's people inside those systems who actually want to limit corporate power and they need ammunition to do it. Our complaints are that ammunition.\n\n> ditch Google and find alternatives\n\nyeah, but what alternatives? You said it yourself. GrapheneOS is limiting, Linux phones aren't daily driver ready, and if we all just quietly migrate to workarounds while the mainstream platform locks down, that's 3 billion people who lose the option entirely. The people who can't or won't run a custom ROM, our parents, our friends, normal people. They just get locked in.\n\nI'm not saying filling out a form is gonna save the world.

If your phone doesn't have Google Mobile Services (like GrapheneOS, LineageOS without gapps, etc), these restrictions shouldn't apply to you directly since they target \"certified Android devices\" meaning devices with GMS.\n\nAs for F-Droid, if the devs who publish apps there refuse to register with Google, their apps get blocked on every phone running Google services. F-Droid itself still works fine on degoogled phones, but their audience shrinks massively overnight since like 95%+ of Android devices are certified. So F-Droid doesn't die technically, but it loses most of its users which means less motivation for devs to publish there, less donations, less maintenance. Slow and sad death basically.\n\nSo the short answer is that your degoogled device stays free, but the ecosystem around it gets starved",

No implementation, no details, no screenshots, no timeline for when this flow will be ready.\n\nNow go to Google's actual policy page developer.android.com/developer-verification, which is separate from a blog post. It still says right now, today\n\n> Starting in September 2026, Android will require all apps to be registered by verified developers in order to be installed on certified Android devices.\n\nNo mention of the advanced flow. No asterisk. No \"except for experienced users\". Just a flat statement that unverified apps will be blocked.\n\nAnd if you're trusting Google's blog post promises, I'd really encourage you to look at their history first. In 2015 Google Photos launched with a promise of free unlimited high-quality storage. People moved their entire photo libraries there based on that. Five years later, Google quietly announced they're ending it. Millions of users were already locked in by then.\n\nSame thing with Stadia, Google promised it would \"kill consoles\", hired big studio executives, sold hardware, wrote tons of blog posts about their vision. Then in 2022 they just shut down the entire thing. Pixel 1-5 owners were promised unlimited Google Photos storage as a literal selling point of the hardware. People bought those phones because of that promise. Pixel 6 comes out and it's just gone, no more unlimited storage, they didn't say anything before doing that.\n\nThey had founding motto \"Don't be evil\". They quietly removed it from their code of conduct in 2018. That's how much a Google promise is worth.\n\nOr look at Manifest V3 in Chrome, they told everyone extensions would keep working fine, then pushed changes that crippled ad blocker functionality. They \"compromised\" just enough to calm people down while still getting what they wanted. Sound familiar?\n\nA blog post saying \"we're building something\" and an official policy page saying \"everything gets blocked\" are two different things. Until the policy page changes or they actually show the implementation, a vague promise in a PR blog post is not walking it back. It's damage control.\n\nAnd by the way, why does that blog post even exist? Because people made noise. Which is exactly what this post is asking people to do",

They found my GitHub, tracked my Reddit posts, and hit me with a legal notice for \"unfair competition\" and trademark infringement.\n\n**Long version:** I maintain a few small open-source projects. About two weeks ago, I released a free, self-hostable tool that lets drone pilots collect, map, and analyze their flight logs locally. I didn't think much of it, just a passion project with a few hundred users.\n\nI can’t name the company (let's call them \"Company A\") because their legal team is actively monitoring my Reddit account and cited my past posts in their notice. Company A is the giant in this space. Their business model goes like this:\n\n* You can upload unlimited flight logs for free.\n* BUT you can only view the last 100 flights.\n* If you want to see your older data, you have to pay a monthly subscription *and* a $15 \"retrieval fee.\"\n* Even then, you can't bulk download your own logs. You have to click them one by one. They effectively hold your own data hostage to lock you into their ecosystem. I am not sure if they are even GDPR complaint even in the EU\n\nTo help people transition to my open-source tool, I wrote a simple web-based script that allowed users to log into their own Company A accounts and automate the bulk download of their own files. Company A did not like this. They served me with a highly aggressive, 4-page legal demand (CEASE and DESIST notice). They forced me to:\n\n1. Nuke the automated download tool entirely from GitHub.\n2. Remove any mention of their company name from my main open-source project and website (since it’s trademarked). I originally had my tagline as \"The Free open-source \\[Company A\\] Alternative,\" which they claimed was illegally driving their traffic to my site.\n3. Remove a feature comparison chart I made. (I admittedly messed up here, I only compared my free tool to their paid tier and omitted their limited free tier, which they claimed was misleading and defamatory).\n\nI'm just a solo dev, so I complied with the core of their demands to stay out of trouble. I scrubbed their name, took down the downloader, and sanitized my website. My main open-source logbook lives independent of them.\n\nI admit I was naive about the legal aspects of comparison marketing and using trademarked names. But the irony is that they probably spent thousands of dollars on lawyer fees to draft a threat against my small project that makes close to zero money (I got a few small donations from happy users).\n\nHas anyone else here ever dealt with corporate lawyers coming after your self-hosted/FOSS projects? It’s a crazy initiation :)",

As noted the company name was more publicly visible and associated to the project (you can see it via git history on the README).\n\nI'm not a lawyer, but I would say that probably has some legal basis. Notably the downloader functionality (IIRC this was a separate repo conveniently/wisely, but OP took that down from public access), which now from what I recall someone else saying is effectively distributed as a proprietary binary now? At least I'm pretty sure there is some legal issues in some countries regarding unsolicited data scraping of a business 🤔\n\nMaybe the free aspect and being OSS helps avoid some concerns there but it's a bit clear why legal action was being raised, it was kind of targeted theft of the companies customers.\n\nThe author offers a fully free project atm, but who's to say they or someone else doesn't then try to offer some paywall features / functionality down the line if there's enough user adoption to support it. Some OSS project's do try to monetize and this one already has a section for donations, such that said customers can provide financial support that they were giving the prior company to this project to get feature work prioritised.\n\nSeems like a grey area 😅 I'm not trying to defend the company that is upset btw, if they were charging fees like that I think that's dumb and I'm all for OSS, but I think I'd be unhappy if someone made a free version of my product and marketed it that way with my own product name to get traffic and steal customers by additionally scraping my own service 🤔",

Any responsible lawyer would tell them there is no legal leg to stand on in an actual suit, and they would get destroyed in court in preliminary hearings if you had even a mediocre lawyer.

Get legal advice and make sure you aren’t doing anything actually illegal, but it’s not unfair practices to make an alternative to an existing product, nor is it illegal to give it away for free, unless you stole it from them (the code, not the idea), you have the right to create and market a product that competes with their unpatented crap.",

          "text": "So, of course I am no lawyer. \n\n**1. The comparisons and the company name on the website**\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominative\\_use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominative_use)\n\nThis directly makes you able to make the comparisons to their product using their logo/name. You can only use their logo if it is the only way to convey who they are. So like Walmart you can't exactly use their logo on your website. If this is who I think it is, then you can use their name without issues. As a note, while you certainly should be honest about your comparisons. You don't have to comply to their will. If you don't want to post the Free Tier comparison you don't have to. But it wouldn't be a bad idea to do it either. Personally I would stiff it to them and not post the Free Tier. \n\nAlso note that this lets you still use the tag line \"The Free open-source \\[Company A\\] Alternative,\" so long as you don't use their logo or font.\n\nMe, I put all the details back and replace logos with names. Email the lawyer back and cite this. They SHOULD back off. \n\n**------------------------------**\n\n**2. The automated download tool**\n\nThis is something that so many companies hate when you do. But it doesn't violate laws directly. It may violate their ToS, but no laws. They did this to strong arm you. I do not actually see anything in their ToS that shows you violated anything. Their Robots.txt does say they don't allow them though. All this to say though, it depends on how you are downloading these things. If you are using links to download but you have to scrape the page to do so then it sits in a grey area. That grey area is able to be litigated. \n\nI can't say how the website is setup but I can say that if they provide links to them and you are simply using those links without scraping then your tool is fine. This would be like clicking the download button on a bunch of pages at one time. While not using some bot to parse all of the data at one time. \n\nI can understand if you don't continue this specific tool, but if you do it in a way that isn't scraping their login-based pages, then you should be fine.\n\n**------------------------------**\n\nOf course, they can always still try to sue you for literally anything. Personally the #1 part shouldn't be a problem. You have legal recourse and if they try to strong arm you then you can easily get a lawyer and then get fees back from them. The #2 is where you have to determine some legality. Never assume their lawyer is going to tell you the truth and never assume they are going to get to a point where they are going to accept your website existing. They will lie and beat you down until you feel the project can no longer continue. They are rats at best and at worst criminals. \n\nAlso, I would HIGHLY suggest getting a lawyer too. They will be able to fight harder than you can as they have a better understanding. ",

I think most of us that were in the software development world before open source really took off in the late 90s and early 00s, would agree that software development and using computers was possible but more expensive and harder to access. The promise of open source software was to bring down barriers of cost and access to most and for those able to grok the source it allowed them to see and manipulate what it was doing. The thing is though that open sourcing software would not only bring down barriers for those that had limited computer access, it also gave capital free access to labor. Open source software developers and maintainers became capital’s useful  idiots, allowing them to build and scale businesses that would not have been viable on top of commercial software.\n\nA couple of stages I can recognize having worked through.\n\n1) Selling commercial off the shelf software becomes difficult due to a constant stream of open source competitors making it difficult for businesses to survive in spaces they previously thrived. Not because their technology wasn’t superior or behind but because free was good enough.\n\n2) New ventures move to the open source freemium pricing as it is the only way to get adoption.\n\n3) Time sharing gets an API and a pay as you go check out cart, it’s now called Cloud Computing. It then grows to deploy and manage services on top of compute establishing vendor lock in. If your open source freemium product takes off it is adopted and extinguished by hyper scalers. \n\n3) The ultimate betrayal. Researchers learn their models are not held back by algorithms but by the size of the data set they are trained on. LLMs are trained on the free labor of open source software developers and the communities open support forums. They have captured that free knowledge as vectors in immense matrices, mix it up and parrot it back as their own. The collective knowledge that was shared so freely is parroted back to every LLM prompt and now worth no more than the tokens a hyper scaler will charge to retrieve it.\n\nOr maybe the ultimate betrayal is this rant about LLMs being crawled by a bot, turned into embedding and used to create a rant for some future clanker who can’t write on their own.\n\nWhere to next?\n\nThank you for coming to my TedTalk.",

That's why I used the Community flair.\n\nA bit of background: A few weeks ago I built a screen recorder that solved a problem for me that no other free screen recorder on the market solved. I never had the intention to make any money out of it and just [published it under MIT License on GitHub](https://github.com/jsattler/BetterCapture). I also [shared the repository in the macapps subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1qza8af/macos_i_built_a_free_open_source_macos_screen/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) hoping some people will find it useful too.\n\nOver the past couple of days, I received lots of positive feedback, mainly through Reddit and GitHub. People I never met or talked to are getting involved in the project and sharing their ideas. A few people even donated money and a Startup asked to sponsor the project. As of writing this, the project has received more than 700 stars on GitHub. It's not as crazy as other projects, but what I learned over the past couple of days is that **building something and sharing it with people who get value out of it, is a really, really good feeling and is encouraging me to keep working on the project in my spare time**. It's very satisfying and fulfilling to see people use what you've built. But that's only one aspect.\n\nI see a lot of people in our industry struggling to keep up with what's happening around AI. People are afraid about not finding or losing jobs. Here is the thing and I hope it's not a surprise by now: **coding alone will not land you a job anymore** (and probably never has). What's much more important now than ever is **credibility and trust that you are able to build and ship something that's useful.** And what's better to demonstrate this skill by building something open source that people actually use. If I ever look for a new job, this project will have more value than putting a 10$ monthly subscription on it.\n\nThat's all I wanted to share and I hope it encourages some people here to get involved in other open source projects or to build something without trying to squeeze every $$$ out of it. Have a nice Sunday!\n\nPS: I also want to acknowledge that I'm in a privileged position and currently do not depend on making money from this project. I get that a lot of people are in a different situation and need to make money to pay their rent.",

      "text": "# KidsTube Filter - Open Source YouTube Content Filtering for Kids 🎬\n\nI built a full-stack parental control application that lets parents create a safe, controlled YouTube experience for their children. It's now **open source** (MIT License) and looking for contributors!\n\n---\n\n## 🔗 Links\n\n**GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/limelightseychelles-git/kidstube-filter  \n**Live Demo**: https://kidstube.bytessolutions.net  \n**Documentation**: [README](https://github.com/limelightseychelles-git/kidstube-filter/blob/main/README.md) • [Setup Guide](https://github.com/limelightseychelles-git/kidstube-filter/blob/main/SETUP.md) • [API Docs](https://github.com/limelightseychelles-git/kidstube-filter/blob/main/API.md)\n\n---\n\n## ✨ What It Does\n\n**For Parents:**\n- ✅ **Channel Whitelisting**: Search and approve specific YouTube channels\n- ✅ **Keyword Blocking**: Filter content by keywords (violence, scary, etc.)\n- ✅ **Video Request Workflow**: Kids request → Parents approve/reject\n- ✅ **Watch History**: Track viewing with time statistics\n- ✅ **PIN Protection**: Secure dashboard with bcrypt-hashed PINs\n- ✅ **Multi-API Key Support**: Automatic rotation for quota management\n\n**For Kids:**\n- 🎬 Clean, simple search interface\n- 🔍 Browse only approved channels\n- 📝 Request videos for parent approval\n- ✅ See request status (pending/approved/rejected)\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Tech Stack\n\n**Frontend:**\n- React 18 (functional components + hooks)\n- Material-UI v5 for UI components\n- React Router v6 for navigation\n- Axios with JWT interceptors\n\n**Backend:**\n- Node.js + Express REST API\n- PostgreSQL for persistence\n- Redis for caching (12hr TTL on API responses)\n- bcrypt for PIN hashing (10 salt rounds)\n- JWT for session management\n\n**Infrastructure:**\n- Nginx reverse proxy\n- PM2 process manager\n- Let's Encrypt SSL\n- Can run on $6/month VPS\n\n**External APIs:**\n- YouTube Data API v3\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Why I Built This\n\nAs an IT auditor and father, I needed granular control over YouTube content for my kids. Existing solutions were either:\n- Too restrictive (YouTube Kids blocks educational content)\n- Too open (regular YouTube has inappropriate suggestions)\n- Not customizable enough\n\nSo I built this from scratch, focusing on:\n1. **Flexibility** - Parents choose exactly which channels are allowed\n2. **Privacy** - Self-hosted, no data collection\n3. **Performance** - Redis caching minimizes API quota usage\n4. **Security** - PIN-based auth, JWT sessions, bcrypt hashing\n\n---\n\n## 🔥 Interesting Technical Challenges\n\n**1. API Quota Management**\n- YouTube gives 10,000 units/day (free tier)\n- Each search costs ~100 units = ~100 searches/day\n- **Solution**: Redis caching with 12hr TTL cut usage by 90%\n\n**2. Dual Interface Architecture**\n- Kids view: No authentication required\n- Parent dashboard: PIN-protected\n- **Solution**: React Context + Protected Routes + JWT\n\n**3.

      "text": "Hello r/opensource,\n\nNote: I know this is some massively long text, but I really wanted to explain the story behind this tool. Feel free to skip to the TL;DR section if you don't want to read.\n\n**The Story:**\n\nOne day, inside me arose an ambition to create the fastest file transfer CLI tool possible in existence. So I looked at existing popular solutions - croc, scp, rsync, and magic wormhole, I discovered one thing they all have in common: they all use TCP. But then recently I've had great interest in QUIC and UDP protocol in general, so I knew I had to make use of this if I had any chance to beat these tools. And I have actually noticed that many of these p2p cli tools lack first-class support for multi-file and folder transfers compared to rsync. But then rsync lacks support for NAT traversal and does not support any random two peers. This was what my tool intended to solve. I had these six ideas in mind:\n\n1). It must use the QUIC protocol, to benefit from the higher success of udp hole punching, and make use of advanced congestion control algorithm like BBR.\n\n2). It must have first-class support for mult-file transfers. Transferring multi files should be as fast, if not faster, than a single file of same size.\n\n3). It must support multiple receivers.\n\n4).It must support random two arbitrary peers, and be cross platform. Should be dead simple to use.\n\n5).It must have automatic resume support.\n\n6). And above all, SPEED over anything else. This should be the core selling point of my tool.\n\nSo I had started building tool during winter vacation last year, and was able to come up with a first working version in Go language - about which I had posted on several other subreddits before. But then unfortunately, it turned out that due to me using AI agent heavily to code it for rapid prototyping, I received lots of negative feedback (some actually genuinely disrespectful) which was honestly quite sad given how much passion I had for the tool, and the fact that tool was only in its early stage. (But thanks for those who has given me constructive criticism and feedback!)\n\nBut instead of staying sad, I embraced these negative comments to remind me that I can be a better coder than an AI agent. In fact, I realized there was room for improvement - while it showed strong performane, it was NOT able to beat scp and rsync in terms of throughput. I had to devise another approach. I thought I could do better than AI agents.\n\nSo in the past month I decided to manually rewrite the whole repo from scratch in Java, the language I'm most familar with, without using AI agents. However, after I built a basic prototype and ran some tests, the result was disappointing; simply speaking, Java's quic libraries and ecosystem was simply not mature enough to rival my previous Go implementation.\n\nTherefore, I decided to move on to C++. Heck, if any language had chance to beat Go, I thought it would be C++. After several painful weeks working day and night coding and debugging in C++, I finally managed to come up with a working implementation. But here are some interesting observations I learned throughout the process:\n\n1). Apparently, I thought using multiple threads with multiple QUIC connections and streams was the correct way to achieve maximum throughput. I thought more parallel connections = better. And this was true for my Go implementation. But turns out in C++ the libraries and language are so efficient that I was able to saturate the network with only single thread and connection. This helped me greatly simplifiy the app logic.\n\n2). QUIC scales heavily with CPU power and core count of the host machine. While QUIC performed worse in low-end devices, for a reasonable CPU released in last 10 years and with at least 2 cores, QUIC outperformed TCP.\n\n3). BBR congestion algorithm made huge difference in terms of throughput in my implementation, almost showing \\~x4 throughput compared to CUBIC. Also, the UDP buffer size of the OS matters a lot. Transfers become nearly \\~x1.3 faster given plenty of UDP buffer size of at least 8 MiB.\n\nAnd finally, the moment of truth came.. to benchmark my tool against existing ones:\n\n* Vultur dedicated CPU 2vCPU(AMD EPYC Genoa) 4GB RAM, NVMe SSD, Ubuntu 22.04\n* Tested over public internet, where sender is located in Chicago and receiver is located in New Jersey.\n* Method: median of 3 runs, and all times are end-to-end wall clock times including setup / closing phase, not just the pure transfer time.\n* Accounts for only the \"receiving phase\"\n\n|Tool|Transport|Random Remote Peers|Multi-Receiver|10 GiB File|1000×10 MiB|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**thruflux(direct)**|QUIC|✅|✅|**1m34s**|**1m31s**|\n|rsync|TCP (SSH)|❌|❌|1m43s|1m39s|\n|scp|TCP (SSH)|❌|❌|1m41s|2m20s|\n|croc|TCP relay|✅|❌|2m42s|9m22s|\n|wormhole|TCP relay|✅|❌|2m45s|❌ stalled \\~8.8 GiB around 3m|\n\n..and it seemed very promising! Even with 6 seconds of initial p2p handshake phase (which scp and rsync doesn't have) my tool was able to beat scp and rsync in terms of wall clock time. Other than scp/rsync, compared to existing p2p tools, my tool appeared to be clearly faster - in fact, for 1000 files transfer, it had shown dominant performance that cannot be ruled out as statstical anomaly. Plus, croc spends time hashing files while wormhole spends lot of time compressing everything for multi-file sends. Since my tool just skips all that extra work, the difference in actual wall clock time was even bigger. But what I really wanted to highlight was how its performance on transferring 1000 or a single file of same size did not change at all. I was proud to have achieved first-class support for multi-file transfers.\n\nSo.. it seemed so good to be true. What were the catches?\n\n1). CPU dependent : My tool required higher CPU power compared to other tools. On devices with low end cpu and only 1 core, it performed marginally worse than rsync and scp.\n\n2). TURN relay fallback: While I included default turn relays in case direct connectivity cannot be established, my self-hosted turn server is not that powerful (also in a pretty bad location) and it therefore showed worse results compared to other tools. So it will be much slower for networks with symmetric NATs.\n\n3). UDP quirks: I found out that some restrictive networks (like my school vps) completely blocks outbound UDP sometimes so not even TURN would work in this case. Basically QUIC is infeasible in this situation.\n\n4). Longer connection phase: Since I'm using a full ICE exchange protocol, initial connection phase is slower than other tools for sure. But I think this is something I can improve upon if I use trickle ICE instead of gather-all like right now.\n\n5). Lack of verification: For speed, my tool trusts the QUIC protocol's network level integrity (which is stronger than TCP by nature). However, there can be rare edge cases such as disk corruption that may corrupt the file. But this is arguably quite rare that I decided to skip for now.\n\n6). Bloated security join code: Unlike croc/wormhole, I do not use PAKE but I rely on WSS TLS encryption and QUIC's innate AED encryption in transit. Therefore, join code must have as high entropy as possible to compensate for the security. I understand some may not love the current join code system, but hopefully it wouldn't matter too much because we all copy paste anyways.\n\nBut regardless, I think there is still some real potential for this tool, especially for multi-file transfer scenarioes. After all, it's still early stage.\n\nAnd this was the story behind this tool. If you managed to read until this part, I really appreciate your time. I hope it was interesting.\n\n**Conclusion (TL;DR)**\n\nI built a new mass transfer CLI named Thruflux in C++, and it has reached an alpha stage (all core functionalities are implemented and basic tests are done, but no guarantee of absolute stability and bug-freeness). Expect occasional bugs due to quirks of networking and cross platform distribution in general, it's still very early stage! But if you ever try it, I really appreciate it and of course, any constructive feedback are welcome :) And of course, if you encounter any bugs please do open an issue in github. Without feedbacks, Thruflux will never be able to move out from its alpha stage.\n\nBy the way, I wiped out all the commit history after having rewritten in C++ because my original commit history is quite unprofessional and contaminated. I'll try my best to write better commit messages this time!\n\n**Install**\n\n**Linux Kernel 3.10+ / glibc 2.17+ (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, etc.)**\n\n    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samsungplay/Thruflux/refs/heads/main/install_linux.sh | bash\n\n**Mac 11.0+ (Intel & Apple Silicon)**\n\n    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samsungplay/Thruflux/refs/heads/main/install_macos.sh | bash\n\n**Windows 10+ (10+ Recommended, technically still could work on Windows 7/8)**\n\n    iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samsungplay/Thruflux/refs/heads/main/install_windows.ps1 | iex\n\n**Use**\n\n    # host files\n    thru host ./photos ./videos\n    \n    # share the join code with multiple peers\n    thru join ABCDEFGH --out ./downloads\n\nRepo:\n\n[https://github.com/samsungplay/Thruflux](https://github.com/samsungplay/Thruflux)",

So personally I don't think it would make sense to sync folders for a simple direct transfer. While I did not do proper benchmarking, syncthing has bunch of other techniques under its sleeves to guarantee safety, so I assume it has more overheads and will be slower. But of course, it will be safer and more continuous because it keeps watching your files for diff. I might try benchmarking with it though. Thanks for the comment",

Unlike traditional SM libraries, Banish evaluates rules within a state until no rule trigger (a fixed-point model) before transitioning. This allows complex rule-based behavior to be expressed declaratively without writing explicit enums or control loops. Additionally it compiles down to plain Rust, allowing seamless integration.\n\n```rust\nuse banish::banish;\n\nfn main() {\n    let buffer = [\"No\".to_string(), \"hey\".to_string()];\n    let target = \"hey\".to_string();\n    let idx = find_index(&buffer, &target);\n    print!(\"{:?}\", idx)\n}\n\nfn find_index(buffer: &[String], target: &str) -> Option<usize> {\n    let mut idx = 0;\n    banish! {\n        @search\n            // This must be first to prevent out-of-bounds panic below.\n            not_found ? idx >= buffer.len() {\n                return None;\n            }\n\n            found ? buffer[idx] != target {\n                idx += 1;\n            } !? { return Some(idx); }\n            // Rule triggered so we re-evalutate rules in search.\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIt being featured as Crate of the Week in the Rust newsletter has been encouraging, and I would love to hear your feedback.\n\nRelease page: https://github.com/LoganFlaherty/banish/releases/tag/v1.1.4\n\nThe project is licensed under MIT or Apache-2.0 and open to contributions.",
