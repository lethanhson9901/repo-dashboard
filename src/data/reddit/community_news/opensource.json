      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI recently reached a big milestone and open-sourced my project, Senlo (a drag-and-drop email builder), under the AGPL-3.0 license. I was excited to contribute to the community and see how others might build upon it.\n\n  \nWell, it didn't take long for the \"dark side\" of OSS to show up. Today, I stumbled upon a fork of my repo. I was initially happy to see interest, but then I looked at the changes. The user had:\n\n1. Completely deleted the LICENSE file.\n2. Totally removed README and ROADMAP files.\n\nIt’s honestly a bit disheartening. I spent months building the rendering engine and the editor logic. I chose AGPL-3.0 specifically to ensure that the project remains open for everyone, but seeing someone try to \"re-brand\" it as their own proprietary work less than 14 days after launch is a gut punch.\n\nI’ve already filed a DMCA takedown notice with GitHub.\n\nI’m not posting this for self-promotion (I’m intentionally not linking my repo unless someone asks), but I wanted to ask the community: Is this a common \"rite of passage\" for new OSS developers?\n\nHow do you guys deal with the frustration when people try to steal your hard work so blatantly? Are there any other steps I should take besides the GitHub complaint to protect the integrity of the license?\n\n",

Forcing removals automatically would be hard because it could flag legitimate cases too, but a non-blocking warning could still have deterrent value.\n\nFor prevention, adopting SPDX headers and aligning with the REUSE format can help. If you add SPDX-License-Identifier (and copyright notices) to the main source files and organize licensing metadata in a REUSE-friendly way (for example a LICENSES/ directory), it becomes much more work for a bad actor to “strip” licensing and attribution, and it’s easier to document what happened if you need to escalate later.",

It's a supply chain problem more than a technical or finance or adoption problem. Because, like take jeans for example, each little component of your jeans might be supplied from different countries, and assembled by other companies in other countries, and same goes for software. One library may be used in millions of programming projects and at what point do you draw the line and at what point does that line become arbitrary. \n\nLike if I make a really widely used npm package, is EU open source obligated to replicate my work (maybe borderline plagiarize) because it came from the US? What about if I was in a different country like say India or Japan or some other place? Does every dependency have to be EU based? Because even a simple python package like openpyxl for example can use dozens of packages imported inside of it so if I'm thinking of using this package as an EU developer, do I have to guarantee the entire dependency list or just that one? And even then THOSE dependencies will likely have dependencies of their own and more and more. At some point where is the line drawn? Coding is so global nowadays too, it's just difficult to draw a line in such a weird intermingling web of dependencies and software everywhere. \n\nSo I'm not saying it's not doable. I'm just curious where the line gets drawn and how that's decided and / or enforced, if at all.",

First offer free or subsidized features to acquire users, then shift focus to overflooding ads and paywalls to generate more profit at the cost of app quality. Honestly, to witness how the popular apps are succumbing to this, and every new one following the same path is really depressing. As it lower the numbers of alternatives for users.\n\nSo now, the obvious solution is to use FOSS apps. And honestly, most of them are really good, as they maintain a reasonable limit of monetization and don't degrade their user experience over time. But, the problem is that, these apps mostly remain niche based. On the other hand many companies who create their own apps based on the same open source code, get all the mainstream attention and generate millions of revenue. This usually isn’t due to technical superiority, but rather access to resources, distribution, and ecosystem advantages that smaller FOSS apps lack.\n\nFor example, many of us may have heard of iText, an open-source PDF library that is widely used across many company's projects, including internally in Google Analytics, Docs, and Calendar. At first, when it was under the MPL/LGPL model adoption was widespread. But when they needed funding to grow, they to shifted to AGPL model (which required companies to use their library, either by sharing their own source code or purchasing a commercial license). In response, every company including Google, either stuck with the old free version or shifted to alternate libraries, even if needed to trade off quality and usability. Even after all this iText was able to survive, due to the mainstream attention they got after winning Belgian Edition of Deloitte's Fast 50 and later, were able to turn profitable. But this is just one case, hundreds of small FOSS apps never reach this level, even when they are technically strong. They may be quietly depended upon, forked around, or replaced, with little recognition or support reaching the original maintainers.\n\nSo, what practical ways exist to help FOSS apps become more mainstream and sustainable without compromising their core principles? And what can users, companies, or communities realistically do to support them?\n\nCurious how others here think about this.",

One thing that I noticed through all these years is that users tend to prefer aesthetics over real purpose.

Something that OSS projects often miss.\n\nSure maybe your audio filter or color gamut is 4% better. Maybe your compression algorithm squeezes 1.7% more out. No one cares. Probably very very few people are even capable of noticing.\n\nIf your application takes a an hour more to learn, that costs businesses an hour of salary per user. That can RAPIDLY erase any cost savings. Having to have 2000 people making an average of $50/hr spend an hour taking a training session to use something is expensive. Very expensive. \n\nMS office is a good example. You have to try to find employees that haven’t used office. Thousands of training courses exist, resources on websites exist, etc. The public education system essentially trains workers in office. Switching to libre office means getting everyone to speed, training, tons of impedance as workflows work different.\n\nDon’t forget that Microsoft Office won, in no small part, because they spent thousands of hours making word and excel extremely easy to teach WordPerfect and lotus 1-2-3 users. Same keyboard shortcuts, usability studies, etc. \n\nThe best product is the one that gets the most utility for the least cost. Pedantic technical correctness rarely meets that burden. Where it does, like OS kernels used to host massive websites, OSS has done exceptionally well. Where it doesn’t you get thousands of (vanishingly) incrementally better applications that no one uses because those improvements don’t matter and the cost of using them is considerably higher",

In other words, if you *want* Youtube, Prime, Netflix, etc to keep working, rooting is... probably fine, but maybe not.\n\nWhen 1080p was the standard, the solution was simple: Buy a dumb TV, or a smart one where you disable all the smart features, and then plug in whatever you want, from a Raspberry Pi to a full-blown media PC. Valve's new Steam Machine is probably overkill, but it looks amazing, especially if you want to install games. (Obviously you'd have to compromise a bit on the 'open source' bit if you want to run Steam on it...)\n\n---\n\nBut [the HDMI Forum refuses to allow HDMI 2.1 on AMD's open source Linux drivers](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1b2gqf8/the_hdmi_forum_has_rejected_amds_proposal_for_an/). This gives you a few bad options:\n\n* Stick to a lower spec, limiting yourself to lower resolutions or refresh rates, and you miss out on features like VRR.\n* Use DisplayPort, but there aren't any decent-sized TVs that have it. Best you could do is a huge monitor, which will cost you like $5k and still be much smaller than a cheap TV.\n* Use a DisplayPort -> HDMI adapters... only specific versions, with specific firmware versions.\n* Use proprietary video drivers with e.g. an NVIDIA card instead -- I've found these to be generally less stable, especially on Wayland, and they frequently miss basic features.\n* Give up on Linux entirely -- Windows on the exact same AMD hardware supports HDMI 2.1.\n\nEven if you solve this, HDMI is *still* oddly limited. For example, Dolby Vision is supported for most streaming apps running on my TV, and I think my Windows PC tried to turn it on by default... at which point the entire display got a garish purple tint. That machine will do 4k HDR at 120hz VRR just fine, just not Dolby Vision.\n\n---\n\nSo... pick your poison. The most flexible setup is to give up and use different machines -- rooted NVIDIA Shield Pro for streaming from your NAS, the smart TV itself can do Youtube/Amazon/Netflix if the Shield ever refuses to (or if you have some weird thing like Dolby Vision), separate PC or console for games (I use a Windows machine for this), and obviously a separate NAS or Jellyfin server.\n\nThe simplest setup is probably just to plug in a Windows PC and use it for everything.",

The cables are expensive enough, but there are no restrictions stopping the exact same AMD GPUs, with the exact same open source Linux drivers, from delivering even more than HDMI 2.1 does.\n\nProblem is finding a TV that actually has a DisplayPort input.\n\nOr finding a DisplayPort -> HDMI adapter that actually works for this purpose. Both DisplayPort and USB-C can carry the HDMI protocol, and this is obviously the technologically superior way to do it -- less hardware in the adapters (and less for them to screw up), and the GPU and drivers support HDMI anyway, right? Except this also means AMD GPUs on Linux will have the same restrictions as they would with an HDMI cable, or with a USB-C -> DisplayPort adapter. You can even daisy-chain USB-C -> DisplayPort -> HDMI and *still* have that problem.",

It's a \"similar post\" scanner across X, for short.\n\nPhoenix Scorer is the same idea, but tuned for making predictions. For example, it will try to predict the odds that you will like or retweet a particular post.\n\nThen they explain what they do with this data once it is all scanned and scored.\n\nI've not tried running it yet, but from my understanding all of the code you need to run both Phoenix models is in that repository.\n\nIt doesn't touch the actual Grok at all.",

Then I left a positive message thanking the developer and the message was lost among other discussions people had within 15 minutes. No response because of that.

Instead of stitching these together with APIs and microservices, they can run in a single process, import each other's code directly, and share data.\n\nWe saw the JavaScript ecosystem expand while Python and Java developers got left behind with fragmented tooling. Node.js took over because it was easy but it locked teams into one language and left performance on the table.\n\nElide is unique because its the only runtime built on GraalVM (instead of V8), so you get access to npm, PyPI, and Maven in one project, compilers that run 10-20x faster with no warmup time, and a memory-safe runtime that closes a whole set of security vulnerabilities.\n\nNow technically, were not faster than some JS runtimes like Bun, but that's a reality we want to make happen really soon!\n\nI've gotten great feedback from JVM developers and were really trying to get as many eyes on this as possible so that we can continue to improve and build for the dev community.

I initially treated it as a numbers game, but that fell on its face pretty hard.\n\nI've posted our project on r/javascript and r/typescript where the posts did terribly. In hindsight, those communities are used to hearing about runtimes, and the polyglot angle seems gimmicky to them which is totally fair.\n\nThe JVM developers at r/java and r/Kotlin saw the project and immediately were able to see some value. Compilation times, advanced tooling, etc. These posts were often targeted to be more informational than promotional, but I always put the GitHub link to try and funnel them to our actual project.\n\nDevs are hard to convince. The analogy I keep in mind is that I'm trying to show and convince a chef to try out and use my cookbook. \n\nFrom two posts alone we were able to get real contributions (with 4 forks and over 50 stars!) So the fact that we are OSS helps A TON because (with the same analogy) now the chef is helping me write my cookbook.\n\nI completely pivoted and instead of trying to make people care, find people who already care.\n\nDistribution really is the hard part for me, but I guess there's a reason why the award is called \"Best Selling Author\" and not \"Best Writing Author.\"",

It’s not designed to be embedded or to interoperate with other managed runtimes. Unlike Python, JavaScript, or Ruby, there’s no interpreter to plug into and no straightforward way to run Go code inside GraalVM’s Truffle framework.\n\nThat isn’t to say that it’s impossible though",

My college internet sucks so I have used almost all major download managers.\n\nIDM is solid but paid, closed-source, and for Windows. Most open source options like XDM are not being maintained actively. Some of these apps are also heavy weight desktop apps.\n\nI wanted something lightweight and fast. So I decided to build one in Golang to really understand networking, concurrency, and low-level file handling. As a second year student I knew very little about these things before this project.\n\nSo I built Surge. It supports\n\n* Parallel connections,\n* Resumable downloads,\n* Beautiful TUI built with Bubbletea and Lipgloss\n\nBenchmarks: On my setup (1 GB file, \\~360 Mbps connection) surge is 1.38x faster than aria2 and as fast as XDM and FDM. This project has exceeded my expectations and I am proud to share it.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/junaid2005p/surge](https://github.com/junaid2005p/surge)\n\nI’m a student developer and this is my attempt to give back to the FOSS community. I’m actively looking for feedback, bug reports, and contributors.\n\n**tldr**: Built an open-source terminal download manager in Go to learn concurrency + networking. It ended up \\~1.4x faster than aria2 in my tests.",
