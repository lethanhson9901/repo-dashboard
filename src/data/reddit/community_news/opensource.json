Still I wanna keep this post mostly technical in manner. \n\n  \nThis is a much broader topic though, open source allows us free and open (and more secure) alternatives compared to closed source alternatives locked to a specific ecosystem which might have conflicts of interest, so in the name of digital sovereignty I want to contribute more to open source to help my fellow members of society. \n\n  \nI'm not trying to fuel a resistance. I'm just looking for ways I can more meaningfully contribute to the world via open source developer contributions directly involved in the movements against locked down technologies tied to potentially tyrannical regimes.

It could be your own government, or it could be a foreign government where your data centers etc. are located.\n\nIf you want to build software that's resilient to shit governments, it needs to be local-first, encrypted transnational and _free_ (as in GPL/software freedoms) by default.

Self-hosting is not a reliable long-term backstop because GitLab can stop releasing features in the Open Source version whenever they want. (And also, self-hosting GitLab sucks.)\n\nForgejo and Gitea are not GitHub-style project hosting services, but software for (self-)hosting repositories.\n\nCodeberg is a Forgejo instance that's open to the public. However, Codeberg e.V. has certain goals. Public repos MUST have a FOSS license, and private repos are discouraged. This is a lot less flexible than what GitHub and GitLab give you.\n\nSelf-hosting is *not* the solution to all our problems. Hosting software responsibly requires continuous maintenance and monitoring. For most software, self-hosting also prevents the formation of community, as self-hosted instances are too small to develop network effects.

Before it was easier to assess an OSS library, but now certain signals that helped establish trust are getting ruined 😅\n\nMore so perhaps for SaaS springing up with APIs or community sites offering user uploads or storage of secrets / PII data. Stuff that I assume will become more common to lean into AI. Just recently a community service for sharing content was exposed to have an XSS vulnerability through SVG uploads that are displayed as a thumbnail for listing user content. That could run JS and steal authentication cookies due to being served from the same origin. Another was a desktop app that you let read your github data but it requested full write permissions that it shouldn't need.\n\nSome devs struggling to maintain more niche projects like libraries are leaning into AI (even if just for review and suggested changes) which is introducing subtle bugs / regressions as the advice sometimes isn't even questioned / discussed in public just applied and merged. More common when the change falls out of the author / reviewers (human) expertise, that they assume the AI probably knows better vs time to verify and grok bad advice.\n\nAI aside, these can still be relevant concerns. Some stuff can be faster by skipping functionality that can be important but not apparent on the surface. I've seen that on project announcements including new DBs from inexperienced devs that know just enough to make it seem like a plausible alternative until someone chimes in why it's significantly faster and how that can lead to data corruption or other concerns 😅",

              "text": "Community popularity is a bit of a tricky metric these days. Take `mise` for example. Lots of stars and community praise. \n\nThat's fully developed with heavy AI assist / workflows. The code base isn't particularly friendly to human contributors (_lots of repeated logic that should have been DRY and thus prone to diverging over time, especially from AI oriented development processes_).\n\nIts true that it's a great tool for the functionality as not many other options exist that can compete. However there are regressions and progressive NIH approach to remove external ecosystem integration to the authors own variant of a tool, one that manages secrets IIRC (`fnox`), yet confidently claiming it's security / trustworthy as if it should be right up there with projects from developers that specialise in that area of development.\n\nWorse the project uses CalVer when SemVer is far more appropriate for using a tool like that (eg: within CI workflows). This is favored to not worry about breaking changes (_which occurred often enough before I sifted through the project on github_), velocity is favored.\n\nPRs are regularly created with an AI summary and rarely any other context references for why the PR was created or decisions that were made.\n\nNo real review process, CI runs, some test suites fail and it merges. Github issues are disabled in favor of Github discussions, which the developer insisted was more appropriate (probably due to popularity / engagement). I feel that they're only OSS to help with adoption and leverage free compute like CI and AI tools that have free tiers for OSS projects, rather than embracing OSS community and practices.\n\nThats from an experienced / established dev too, not just an inexperienced vibe coder which would be far worse.\n\n---\n\nAnother example is a website that is OSS on github, again experienced dev (but like 40k commits in a year when they switched to using AI for development velocity).\n\nThey served user content from the same origin as authentication cookies, no sanitising of content like SVG for associating an image with a user upload (the site is for sharing community automation extensions and discovery).\n\nThis tool and site were quite popular, but a mistake like this permitted an attacker to use SVG for their extension page (which has that graphic appear in list views elsewhere),  running JS to steal authentication session and if that viewer that was compromised was logged in with any of their own extensions published they'd get modified with the same infection to spread and the attacker had access to a refresh token and provisioning of API tokens from this point. So they could publish these extensions with actual malware given the deployment environments access to additional resources and secrets which a much larger user base would consume (eg: for social media management or deploying servers).\n\nOne of their other projects did get a bug report about their app requesting full write permission token to github when it should only need limited read access scope. No engagement in weeks by the dev that continued to iterate on the project adding more features. Perhaps too much signal noise that they didn't even notice the report, or in their opinion it's not a concern? 🤷‍♂️\n\nPrivacy / security is important but even if that's claimed and is popular it's something we have to be more cautious about at face value. Especially if AI is leading that development, where some believe that just asking their AI tooling to perform reviews that ensure it respects those goals doesn't actually mean it can be trusted to deliver that properly 😅 (_but it will still be claimed to attract a demographic, even if the dev is well intentioned if they're not actively trying but just relying on implementation through delegation, they may feel confident that it is the truth whilst not knowing any better_)",

      "text": "[This project](https://github.com/mrinfinidy/qrcode-pretty) started as a tool I built for work.\n\nI needed to create company branded QR codes to encode URLs. But the tools i found for my package manager didn't allow for much customization. So I tried some online qr code generator, which offered fancy design options. When I scanned the generated qr code, they led to some random URL that expired after a week unless I paid.  \nSo I took it upon myself to build a simple CLI tool that generates company branded QR codes, which could also be integrated into automation workflows. The next step was to generalize this tool by adding command options so anyone could customize their QR codes easily. That's how **QR Code Pretty** came to life.\n\nFor those wondering why I'm only promoting it only now (after 8 months): I just never got around to packaging it for easy installation...until now.\n\n  \nCheck out some pretty samples in my repo!",

      "text": "It appears that the developer of [Borderless Gaming](https://store.steampowered.com/app/388080/Borderless_Gaming/) used Magpie’s code and is selling it as his own software in violation of the GPLv3, while rejecting all accusations\n\nOn [Magpie’s GitHub page](https://github.com/Blinue/Magpie/issues/1367), a large amount of evidence is accumulating showing that the Borderless Gaming developer used Magpie’s GPLv3 code to create a new “reimagined after 11 years” version that is being sold on Steam. This would not be an issue if the license terms were respected. Instead, the Borderless Gaming developer dismisses all accusations, claims the code is his own, and comes up with excuse after excuse for every new piece of evidence\n\nAt first, he had no choice but to admit that all Borderless Gaming shaders are derivatives of Magpie’s shaders, because they are not just similar, but 100% identical, except that MagpieFX was renamed to BGFX. You can literally use a Magpie shader without any changes and it will work. To avoid the implications of the GPLv3 license, which would force him to open-source all of Borderless Gaming, he claims that he created an “aggregate” under Section 5, and that the shaders shipped with the program are an independent product and have nothing to do with his application, which he claims is 100% his own and does not use Magpie’s code\n\nEven this single episode does not stand up to any criticism, because under the same license an “aggregate” must not form a larger program, and in this case it clearly does. Without the shaders, Borderless Gaming is just a non-functional shell and would not have the long list of features introduced in this “reimagined” update. Moreover, despite admitting that all shaders were taken from Magpie, all references to Magpie were removed. No copyright notice, no license reference, nothing. Instead, MagpieFX was renamed to BGFX to create the impression that this is his own development\n\nAs for the binary part of the program, it likely contains the entirety of Magpie’s code, since all or most of Magpie’s class names were found in it. However, the developer categorically denies this, because admitting it would require releasing the entire product’s source code. This stance is very convenient, given that everything was compiled into a binary format and he appears confident that no one has proof. According to him, the class names are merely a coincidence, since the program performs similar functions and there is only one correct way to implement them\n\nTo support his claims, he published the source code of one class, apparently to demonstrate that it was written in a different language, C# versus C++. However, the Magpie developer recognized it as his own code, stating that the entire class, including its structure, control flow, and variable names, was simply ported to C#, which is unquestionably a derivative work\n\nLater, new evidence emerged, this time showing that some Magpie shaders, which are not effects but internal shaders, were fully embedded into the Borderless Gaming binary as plain text. These shaders matched 100%, including variable names and even some fairly unique numeric constants, and also contained comments that were obviously generated by an LLM. This time, the Borderless Gaming developer claimed that the code was supposedly well documented and that he found it on Stack Overflow. When asked to provide the documentation or links to Stack Overflow, he refused, claiming that life is short. His comments explaining why the shader code matched 100% also appear absurd, as if he does not understand what the code is or what it does\n\nThe Magpie developer, on the other hand, stated that this part of his program is poorly documented and that the code is his personal creation, developed through trial and error. Some comments also reveal interesting facts about the Borderless Gaming developer. For example, that he sells a 7 euro program that simply enables file system compression, presenting it as his own compression method. Or that he claims to be the developer of the Rainway service, which was supposedly sold to Microsoft. However, there is no confirmation of this from the company.\n\nThe Magpie developer was advised to contact Valve with this information, clearly suggesting filing a DMCA notice. What he will do next is currently unknown. In the meantime, I decided to share my findings with a wider audience to bring public attention to the matter. It is also possible that someone may be able to gather additional evidence\n\nTldr: The developer of Borderless Gaming has a history of being dishonest and using LLMs. His latest app update is not a clean-room rewrite. He is reusing GPL code, removing attribution, ignoring licensing, and choosing to gaslight others, instead of answering questions\n\nSource: [https://github.com/Blinue/Magpie/issues/1367](https://github.com/Blinue/Magpie/issues/1367)\n\nSteampage: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/388080/Borderless\\_Gaming/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/388080/Borderless_Gaming/)",

I don't know yet). ideally using the cli, but a gui is fine too. Here's the catch, I need to be certain that I'm not adding in compression or otherwise messing with the data in any way other than rotating it, since this is for digital preservation purposes. What nix compatible tools are there for this purpose, and what can I do to verify image integrity is ensured.

      "text": "I’m looking for advice from people who’ve started or maintained open‑source projects in niche or non‑software‑centric domains.\n\nMy background is in live entertainment production (theatre, concerts, touring). I’ve spent years watching teams manage people, schedules, inventory, and sensitive data through a mix of Word, Excel, email, and shared drives. Most of this work is deterministic and repeatable, but it’s still done manually or with fragile, one‑off automations.\n\nOver the past year, I’ve been exploring an open‑source, offline‑first collaboration tool aimed at production workflows. I’ve focused mostly on problem definition and architecture, with some small proofs of concept, but nothing close to something I’d ask others to use yet.\n\nMy questions are about **process and feasibility**:\n\n* How do maintainers bootstrap contributors when the domain is niche?\n* What level of implementation or polish is usually expected before asking for help, and is it common for contributors to engage at the architecture/design stage?\n* Is it realistic to expect organic contributors for a project like this, or do projects in this space typically start with paid development and open up later?\n\nI’m comfortable continuing to work on this as a long‑term learning and design exercise, but I want to be realistic about expectations and respectful of open‑source norms.\n\nIf it helps, here’s a repo I built with an early architecture draft:  \n[https://github.com/wlococode/openprod](https://github.com/wlococode/openprod)\n\nI'm happy to share additional details and POC code if useful.

The kicker is when they mention that they **need** the feature for work, but also couldn't possibly pay for it or buy me a pizza gift card. \n\nAnd if you have a more positive user experience than that (not all projects I've been involved in have been awful), consider that a happy bonus.",

(Going through the same thing right now)\n\nI’ve found that the best responses have come from communities that are hyper-targeted. From my case, building an OSS runtime, we technically target a lot of different languages, but always get the most valuable feedback and users from the Kotlin community.\n\nWhat’s surprising is that often people find our project through some old HN or Reddit thread, join our community and begin helping out. We recently had one person build Arch Linux Packages to help us out with support on that front. So a big part is building the infrastructure (like a discord) so that people can funnel into a place where you can actively communicate and yes like you mentioned having your GitHub setup so that it is easy to find smt to work on and get reference docs.\n\nThe last way that’s worked really well (but the slowest) has been word of mouth. It has been amazing for specifically forks. If it’s within your means to go to a place where you know your ICP congregates, you can always convince a few people to take a crack at your project.",

Especially if you want to attract new people who might know about you or your projects. \n\nThe best success I’ve had finding new contributors was posting in active yet specific communities. A lot of the projects I make are related to bioinformatics, so posting in places like r/bioinformatics or scientific computing in rust has netted me a few contributors. And for my Rust related projects, getting published in this week in rust has been amazing since they specifically have a section about Rust projects requesting help with specific issues. \n\nIf you want to avoid hate, all you really need to do is take the time to read the community guidelines and see 1. If they allow self promotion at all and 2. How they want you to format your posts. \n\nUltimately, no one will care about your projects as much as you, but if you have a good code base/project, you should be able to get a fair number of contributions; it’s just a matter of marketing yourself\n\nGood first issues hasn’t really been a game changer for me (though others might have different experiences). When asking for help, in the places where allowed, I share specific issues that I’m looking for help with. In some of the community that allow self promo, posting an explanation of your project and linking to it is sometimes enough to get people to contribute (as long as you have open issues). Generally you want to make contributing to your project as easy as possible. One of my more recent contributors suggested adding justfiles so that it’s easier to test and lint the different modules of the project which has been a game changer for me. With the issues I list, I usually try to be as specific as possible about the help that I need and where in the project the solution should go (whether in an existing file or a new file/folder). \n\nGood luck!",

I literally protect those issues from drive‑bys and keep them reserved for newcomers so they have a clean first win.\n\n\n\nHigh friction setup kills my interest fast. I want: one‑command dev env, a sample dataset, and a 5‑minute path to running tests. If that’s hard, at least ship a devcontainer or docker‑compose.\n\n\n\nI’ve used GitHub Discussions and a tiny Discord to keep contributors engaged, Reddit keyword alerts with Feedly/TweetDeck‑style tools to find threads about seeding/testing, and more recently stuff like Mention + SparkToro + Pulse to spot very specific conversations where my project is an actually useful answer, not just a link drop.\n\n\n\nMain point: present it as a shared mission with a smooth first win, not a product launch.",

So I decided to build one myself.\n\n**What DayFlow focuses on:**\n\n* Clean, modern calendar UI inspired by macOS Calendar\n* Built with React, designed for modern web apps\n* Easy to integrate with **shadcn-ui** and other Tailwind UI libraries\n* Modular architecture (views, events, panels are customizable)\n\nThe project is fully open source, and I’d really appreciate:\n\n* Feedback on the API & architecture\n* Feature suggestions\n* Bug reports\n* Or **PRs** if you’re interested in contributing\n\nGitHub:  [ https://github.com/dayflow-js/calendar ](https://github.com/dayflow-js/calendar)\n\nDemo:  [ https://dayflow-js.github.io/calendar/ ](https://dayflow-js.github.io/calendar/)\n\nThanks for reading, and I’d love to hear your thoughts 🙏",
