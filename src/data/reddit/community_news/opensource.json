To make any change, you need to replace the entire message.\n\n>And also how does adding a message for all recipients work - is it duplicated for each user automatically or do I have to copy and paste the message for each recipient?\n\nYou simply write the message once and select the recipients using checkboxes. The system handles the duplication automatically. You can see this demonstrated in the video on the homepage.\n\n>Also - this has been discussed already in this post - but I absolutely agree, that I would probably forget to check in actively with the email. \n\nYou don’t need to remember to check in proactively. You only need to take action when you receive the check-in email (for example, once per month). Supporting additional notification channels would definitely be a useful future improvement.",

Weekly check-ins work until you're on vacation with spotty internet, or sick for 10 days, and suddenly your encrypted secrets get sent to all your contacts. The systems that work long-term tend to have: (1) escalating check-in prompts (email reminder at 5 days, SMS at 6 days, phone call at 7 days before triggering), (2) configurable grace periods (disable for known travel), (3) multi-factor confirmation before release (requiring both time threshold AND explicit trigger from a trusted contact). The self-hosted approach solves the trust problem but creates the availability problem—if your server goes down, are you locked out or does it auto-trigger? Would be good to document the failure modes and recovery paths.",

Proof-of-life reliability is the hardest part.\n\nThe system is intentionally simple and email-only for now, but it’s not a single missed check-in -> instant release. You can configure the check-in interval, how many reminders are sent, and the delay between them.   \n  \nA trusted contact can be notified before final delivery and can pause the process, in case of forced inactivity (coma, arrest, etc)  \n  \nEach recipient can also have its own delivery delay — a useful setup is adding a secondary personal email with no delay and longer delays for everyone else, so there’s still time to stop an accidental trigger. There’s also a recovery code generated at first login that lets you block delivery even if you lose access to your email.\n\nOn the self-hosted side, if the server goes down and later comes back online, it simply resumes the reminder sequence instead of triggering delivery. For example, with eight weekly reminders, if it goes offline after the third and returns months later, it sends the fourth reminder, not the final release.",

Common misconception. \"Free as in freedom, not as in beer\", or in other words - *libre*, not necessarily *gratis*. This means you can take say the Linux Kernel for free (*gratis*) and are free *(libre)* to sell it so someone else under the same license, so then they can sell it and so on. Anyone in that chain can also redistribute it for free (*gratis*).  \n  \nBlizzard might not be enforcing the TOS *yet* \\- maybe they don't know it's being broken, maybe they don't care, but they still *could* do it at any time. Dangerous place to be in - look up \"cyberpunk VR mod\".\n\nConfig files/presets/a script to do these changes (often called *assets*) to a GPL-thing might not be GPL itself and it doesn't have to, unless a specific set of circumstances occur. \"GPL virality\" is the term to look up here.\n\nLicense cannot be changed backwards, you were already granted the license. In legal terms this is often referred to as *no taksies backsies*.

      "text": "Hi all, I built a CLI tool that allows you to seamlessly install software from GitHub release assets, similar to how your system's package manager installs software.\n\nIt works by exploiting common patterns among GitHub releases across different open-source software such as naming conventions and file layouts to fetch proper release assets for your system and then downloading the proper asset onto your machine via the GitHub API. Parm will then extract the files, find the proper binaries, and then add them to your PATH. Parm can also check for updates and uninstall software, and otherwise manages the entire lifecycle of all software installed by Parm.\n\nParm is not meant to replace your system's package manager. It is instead meant as an alternative method to install prebuilt software off of GitHub in a more centralized and simpler way.\n\nIt's currently in a pre-release stage, but I'm working on a v0.2.0 milestone, though there's still some work to do. If this sounds interesting to you, check it out! It's completely free and open-source and is currently released for Linux/macOS (Windows coming soon). I would appreciate any feedback.\n\nLink: [https://github.com/yhoundz/parm](https://github.com/yhoundz/parm)",

I've hardly seen a more polished version 0.0.1 of any app :)\n\nText chat with reactions and files, voice chats, screen sharing (no audio), roles and rights, but otherwise very basic. Might be just perfect through for small groups of friends.",

Maybe DMs, some more customization, native apps. That's within reach. \n\nBut tbh the discord downfall has shown me that what really holds FOSS back is the extreme fracturing with a 10 large projects, 10s of larger community efforts and 100s of one-person side hustles that all try to copy discord, but most are at best 40% there in quality or features. Diversity is cool and projects like Sharkord are really impressive for a one-man-show. But overall, open source is held back because 1000s of people will build 100s of decent tools, but not enough teams come together to build ONE truly great alternative.\n\nSomehow reminds me of the early Rebels in Andor. A dozen factions too splintered and small to put up a good fight.",

Zulip works well for communities that prefer threaded conversations over real-time chat. The tradeoff: Matrix has the best protocol and federation story but Element's UI feels heavier than Discord. Revolt has a snappier UI but less deployment flexibility. If you're moving an existing Discord community, the hardest part isn't the software—it's convincing everyone to install another app. Export your Discord message history first, and consider running a Matrix bridge so people can participate from Discord while you transition. Makes migration gradual instead of forcing a hard cutover.",

There is a downside of your ip being exposed however using a proxy or bouncer or whatever will get around that. There’s tons of existing servers with cool and weird channels to explore. I use irssi but other common clients are hex chat or libera chat. There are also online irc clients that can hide your ip. \n\nI like IRC because you control all of the important aspects, I can spoof my ip, don’t have to authenticate with any bs, can change who I am at any time, unless the server has it you don’t have to password or username. It’s just good old Internet fun! Plus lots of super smart people hang out on there because it has a niche-ness to it nowadays. Check out the IRC subreddit\n\nIRC IS TEXT ONLY! No vc and no images",

Start with the Part Design workbench tutorial - it teaches the constraint-based sketching model\n2. Use the spreadsheet workbench to parameterize designs (massive for variant generation)\n3.

Additionally, there are a number of other features in the app, like templates, importing and exporting presents, an info center featuring public domain documents, and more! The goal of the project is to put users in the driver’s seat (quickly self-host via docker), and easily allow them to create binaural beats via an intuitive web interface. No ads, no locked features, no mystery audio.\n\n  \nGitHub repo (code, install instructions):  \n[https://github.com/jlar0che/BrainWave](https://github.com/jlar0che/BrainWave)\n\nProject write-up with context and motivation:  \n[https://www.digitalcuriosity.center/project/brainwave-binaural-beats-audio-generator](https://www.digitalcuriosity.center/project/brainwave-binaural-beats-audio-generator)\n\nProject Demo:  \n[https://brainwave.digitalcuriosity.center](https://brainwave.digitalcuriosity.center)  \n \n\nFeedback, issues, or contributions are welcome (especially around audio accuracy, UI improvements, or use cases I haven’t thought of)!",

That set me off down a rabbit hole where I discovered that it works by interrupting your synapses’ waves and thus offers clues to how consciousness works. That made me want to try binaural beats again, so your project’s timing is perfect. One feature I’d like is to be able to modulate both oscillators with LFOs to give evolving soundscapes.  mynoise.net kinda lets you do this but without the granular control yours could. So I’ve only listen to this on my phone’s speakers but am about to try it properly with some ear buds. Thanks!",

I found some kind of batch file code thing to fix this but I don't know how to use it. I'm not really big into technology so I'm obviously very incompetent at these kinds of things, so no need to point that out. I'm just trying to stop using anything run by p\\*dofile billionaires (all of them). Right now I'm ripping my CD with Windows Media Player but I don't want to be reliant on that since I'm looking to switch to Linux very soon and completely abandon everything run by Microsoft, among all other huge companies. \n\nAnybody know any good open source program that let's you rip an entire CD just as easily as Windows Media Player does? Why is this not a feature in VLC? I find it a bit strange. Or maybe if someone could explain how to use the batch file thingy.\n\nPlease don't be brutal on me if I come off as an idiot, I'm trying my best here.\n\nThanks.",

      "text": "Hi r/OpenSource!\n\nI’ve been working on a project called Vectoria, and I finally released it as my first major open-source contribution (MIT License).\n\n**The Problem:** I wanted a way to perform RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) and semantic clustering on my private data (notes, research, customer feedback) without uploading anything to a cloud server, paying for API credits and just having something easy to use.\n\n**The Solution:** I built a system that runs the entire AI pipeline in the browser.\n\n**The Tech Stack (The fun part):** Getting this to run client-side was a fun challenge. Here is how it works under the hood:\n\n- Embeddings: Uses Transformers.js to vectorize text directly in the browser.\n\n- Clustering: Runs HDBSCAN via Pyodide (running Python sci-kit learn inside the browser).\n\n- Visualization: Uses UMAP-WASM for high-performance 2D plotting.\n\n- Inference: Uses WebLLM (WebGPU) to run models like Gemma 2 and Llama 3 locally for the RAG chat.\n\nWhy I'm posting: Since this is my first big open-source release, I’m looking for feedback on the architecture and implementation. If you are interested in WebGPU, browser-based ML, or just want a local tool for document analysis, \n\nI’d love for you to check it out and/or collaborate. You can also fork it if you wish:)\n\n\nRepo: https://github.com/arminpasalic/vectoria\nDemo/app: https://vectoria.app/\n\n\nIt’s completely free and requires zero setup other than a modern browser. Let me know what you think!",
