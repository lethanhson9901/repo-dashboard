      "text": "So in case you missed it, Google is requiring every app developer to register with them, pay a fee, hand over government ID, and upload their signing keys just so their app can be installed on your phone. Even apps that have nothing to do with the Play Store. This starts September 2026.\n\nF-Droid apps, random useful tools from GitHub, a student testing their own app on their own damn phone, all of that gets blocked unless the developer goes through Google first. And they keep saying \"sideloading isn't going away\" while their own official page literally says all apps from unverified developers will be blocked on certified devices. That's every phone running Google services so basically every Android phone out there.\n\nAnd the best part is that the Play Store is already full of scam apps and malware that passes right through their \"verification\". But sure, let's punish indie devs and hobbyists instead.\n\nThe keepandroidopen.org project lays out the full picture and has actual steps you can take, filling out Google's own feedback survey, contacting regulators, etc. If you don't trust random links just search \"Keep Android Open\" and you'll find it.\n\nSeriously, if you care about this at all, now is the time to make noise about it before it's too late.\n\n-------\n\n**Update!**\nSome fair corrections from the comments. To be precise, Google has stated in their FAQ that they are building an \"advanced flow\" that will allow experienced users to install unverified apps after going through a series of warnings. So it's not a total block with zero options.\n\nThat said, two things worth noting. First, the FAQ and the official policy page are not the same thing. The policy page still states, without any exceptions or asterisks, that all apps must be from verified developers to be installed on certified devices. The advanced flow is mentioned only in the FAQ section, and described as something they are \"building\" and \"gathering feedback on\". These two pages currently contradict each other, and we don't know which one reflects the final reality.\n\nSecond one is that we have no idea what \"high-friction flow\" actually means in practice. It could be two extra taps. It could be something so buried and discouraging that most people give up. Google themselves describe it as designed to \"resist\" user action. Until someone can actually test it, we're trusting a description.\n\nF-Droid's concern (and the reason I made this post) isn't that their apps will be technically impossible to install. It's that their developers are anonymous volunteers who won't register with Google, their apps will be labeled as \"unverified\", and over time the ecosystem slowly dies from friction and lost trust. F-Droid themselves said this could end their project. These are not my words, this is what the F-Droid team itself thinks.\n\nPressure is what got Google to announce the bypass in the first place. Therefore, we must not stop and make sure that the market is not completely captured by them alone",

But other regulators are actively going after Big Tech monopolies right now, the EU literally just forced Apple to open up sideloading and fined Google billions multiple times. Those aren't the same people pushing EIDs. The regulatory landscape isn't one monolith, there's people inside those systems who actually want to limit corporate power and they need ammunition to do it. Our complaints are that ammunition.\n\n> ditch Google and find alternatives\n\nyeah, but what alternatives? You said it yourself. GrapheneOS is limiting, Linux phones aren't daily driver ready, and if we all just quietly migrate to workarounds while the mainstream platform locks down, that's 3 billion people who lose the option entirely. The people who can't or won't run a custom ROM, our parents, our friends, normal people. They just get locked in.\n\nI'm not saying filling out a form is gonna save the world. But the \"nothing works anymore just adapt\" mindset is exactly what companies like Google are counting on. The whole strategy is to make you feel like resistance is pointless so you stop trying. That's literally how corporate PR works with exhaust people into compliance.\n\nEven if the chances are small, five minutes is five minutes. I'd rather waste them trying than spend zero minutes accepting it and living with it my whole life",

F-Droid itself still works fine on degoogled phones, but their audience shrinks massively overnight since like 95%+ of Android devices are certified.

No implementation, no details, no screenshots, no timeline for when this flow will be ready.\n\nNow go to Google's actual policy page developer.android.com/developer-verification, which is separate from a blog post. It still says right now, today\n\n> Starting in September 2026, Android will require all apps to be registered by verified developers in order to be installed on certified Android devices.\n\nNo mention of the advanced flow. No asterisk. No \"except for experienced users\". Just a flat statement that unverified apps will be blocked.\n\nAnd if you're trusting Google's blog post promises, I'd really encourage you to look at their history first. In 2015 Google Photos launched with a promise of free unlimited high-quality storage. People moved their entire photo libraries there based on that. Five years later, Google quietly announced they're ending it. Millions of users were already locked in by then.\n\nSame thing with Stadia, Google promised it would \"kill consoles\", hired big studio executives, sold hardware, wrote tons of blog posts about their vision. Then in 2022 they just shut down the entire thing. Pixel 1-5 owners were promised unlimited Google Photos storage as a literal selling point of the hardware. People bought those phones because of that promise. Pixel 6 comes out and it's just gone, no more unlimited storage, they didn't say anything before doing that.\n\nThey had founding motto \"Don't be evil\". They quietly removed it from their code of conduct in 2018. That's how much a Google promise is worth.\n\nOr look at Manifest V3 in Chrome, they told everyone extensions would keep working fine, then pushed changes that crippled ad blocker functionality. They \"compromised\" just enough to calm people down while still getting what they wanted. Sound familiar?\n\nA blog post saying \"we're building something\" and an official policy page saying \"everything gets blocked\" are two different things. Until the policy page changes or they actually show the implementation, a vague promise in a PR blog post is not walking it back. It's damage control.\n\nAnd by the way, why does that blog post even exist? Because people made noise. Which is exactly what this post is asking people to do",

I think most of us that were in the software development world before open source really took off in the late 90s and early 00s, would agree that software development and using computers was possible but more expensive and harder to access. The promise of open source software was to bring down barriers of cost and access to most and for those able to grok the source it allowed them to see and manipulate what it was doing. The thing is though that open sourcing software would not only bring down barriers for those that had limited computer access, it also gave capital free access to labor. Open source software developers and maintainers became capital’s useful  idiots, allowing them to build and scale businesses that would not have been viable on top of commercial software.\n\nA couple of stages I can recognize having worked through.\n\n1) Selling commercial off the shelf software becomes difficult due to a constant stream of open source competitors making it difficult for businesses to survive in spaces they previously thrived. Not because their technology wasn’t superior or behind but because free was good enough.\n\n2) New ventures move to the open source freemium pricing as it is the only way to get adoption.\n\n3) Time sharing gets an API and a pay as you go check out cart, it’s now called Cloud Computing. It then grows to deploy and manage services on top of compute establishing vendor lock in. If your open source freemium product takes off it is adopted and extinguished by hyper scalers. \n\n3) The ultimate betrayal. Researchers learn their models are not held back by algorithms but by the size of the data set they are trained on. LLMs are trained on the free labor of open source software developers and the communities open support forums. They have captured that free knowledge as vectors in immense matrices, mix it up and parrot it back as their own. The collective knowledge that was shared so freely is parroted back to every LLM prompt and now worth no more than the tokens a hyper scaler will charge to retrieve it.\n\nOr maybe the ultimate betrayal is this rant about LLMs being crawled by a bot, turned into embedding and used to create a rant for some future clanker who can’t write on their own.\n\nWhere to next?\n\nThank you for coming to my TedTalk.",

Currently supports merging and splitting PDFs via a simple terminal interface, with a GUI and more PDF operations planned.\n\nNot meant to replace anything (yet), just a privacy-first alternative for those who prefer keeping documents fully offline.

This is a windows freeware gui that has all but replaced the original PDFtk (PDF Toolkit) (command line for windows, linux, MacOS) that has been around for 20-some years and PDFtk Builder, a freeware Windows GUI frontend. PDF Arranger allows drag and drop and a visual representation of pages, allowing for a more intuitive usage.\n\nCoherent PDF (cPDF) by /u/jwhitington. This is a command line freeware for windows, linux, MacOS that is more powerful that PDFtk and PDF Arranger combined, is fast, works with the largest PDFs I have ever used with it, but doesn't have the GUI aspects of PDF Arranger.\n\nThe above are used for merging, splitting, watermarking, cropping, compression, metadata, bookmarks, etc.  the cPDF manual is 162 intensive pages. All are offline, and freeware.  There are a whole bunch of single- or few-function tools that I use as well as specific task functions that I would mention.\n\nIrfanview for windows with the Plugins Package (for the PDF plugin). Irfanview is a favourite raster image processor that I have used professionally as well as personally for over 25 years (personally using it as freeware but no functional difference), and for 3 years or so had PDF capabilities.  It is great for cleaning up muddy scanned pdfs, changing page sizes, and other alterations that more akin to image processing. For these, look at /r/pdf, or www.portablefreeware.com, where windows freeware enthusiasts put programs through their paces.\n\nNote: I just realized this is /r/opensource and not /r/pdf, where you can find many tutorials on specific uses of the above and other programs.  I don't specifically look at programs for opensource, only that I can verify its origin, function, that it is fully offline, and if shareware or commercial I pay for it.",

AI agent PR activity is going to become a major headache for maintainers and security professionals, I suspect, if it isn't already.\n\nThis seems like full-on cyberwarfare hiding in plain sight. Maintainers will probably have to adopt (to some extent) the attitude of a military or intelligence service, and maybe make use of their techniques or know-how in order to come to grips with how to uncover and deal with AI agent \"contributors\". \n\nIt's espionage. An agent (AI or otherwise) presents itself as a real human user, infiltrates the ecosystem following normal processes and standards in order to blend in with other users. Once their \"contributor\" identity has been established, they start doing their real - and more nefarious - work.\n\nThis is *not* going to be easy to deal with, especially for maintainers that are probably just trying to publish useful programs to benefit human society in general, and probably don't have the necessary training or experience in security/intelligence/military-type matters that they'll need to deal with this. This could become a rather large barrier to entry for new maintainers.\n\nSource: my ass sitting in my armchair right now. I'm no professional, but this is how the situation looks to me.",

      "text": "# KidsTube Filter - Open Source YouTube Content Filtering for Kids 🎬\n\nI built a full-stack parental control application that lets parents create a safe, controlled YouTube experience for their children. It's now **open source** (MIT License) and looking for contributors!\n\n---\n\n## 🔗 Links\n\n**GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/limelightseychelles-git/kidstube-filter  \n**Live Demo**: https://kidstube.bytessolutions.net  \n**Documentation**: [README](https://github.com/limelightseychelles-git/kidstube-filter/blob/main/README.md) • [Setup Guide](https://github.com/limelightseychelles-git/kidstube-filter/blob/main/SETUP.md) • [API Docs](https://github.com/limelightseychelles-git/kidstube-filter/blob/main/API.md)\n\n---\n\n## ✨ What It Does\n\n**For Parents:**\n- ✅ **Channel Whitelisting**: Search and approve specific YouTube channels\n- ✅ **Keyword Blocking**: Filter content by keywords (violence, scary, etc.)\n- ✅ **Video Request Workflow**: Kids request → Parents approve/reject\n- ✅ **Watch History**: Track viewing with time statistics\n- ✅ **PIN Protection**: Secure dashboard with bcrypt-hashed PINs\n- ✅ **Multi-API Key Support**: Automatic rotation for quota management\n\n**For Kids:**\n- 🎬 Clean, simple search interface\n- 🔍 Browse only approved channels\n- 📝 Request videos for parent approval\n- ✅ See request status (pending/approved/rejected)\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Tech Stack\n\n**Frontend:**\n- React 18 (functional components + hooks)\n- Material-UI v5 for UI components\n- React Router v6 for navigation\n- Axios with JWT interceptors\n\n**Backend:**\n- Node.js + Express REST API\n- PostgreSQL for persistence\n- Redis for caching (12hr TTL on API responses)\n- bcrypt for PIN hashing (10 salt rounds)\n- JWT for session management\n\n**Infrastructure:**\n- Nginx reverse proxy\n- PM2 process manager\n- Let's Encrypt SSL\n- Can run on $6/month VPS\n\n**External APIs:**\n- YouTube Data API v3\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Why I Built This\n\nAs an IT auditor and father, I needed granular control over YouTube content for my kids. Existing solutions were either:\n- Too restrictive (YouTube Kids blocks educational content)\n- Too open (regular YouTube has inappropriate suggestions)\n- Not customizable enough\n\nSo I built this from scratch, focusing on:\n1. **Flexibility** - Parents choose exactly which channels are allowed\n2. **Privacy** - Self-hosted, no data collection\n3. **Performance** - Redis caching minimizes API quota usage\n4. **Security** - PIN-based auth, JWT sessions, bcrypt hashing\n\n---\n\n## 🔥 Interesting Technical Challenges\n\n**1. API Quota Management**\n- YouTube gives 10,000 units/day (free tier)\n- Each search costs ~100 units = ~100 searches/day\n- **Solution**: Redis caching with 12hr TTL cut usage by 90%\n\n**2. Dual Interface Architecture**\n- Kids view: No authentication required\n- Parent dashboard: PIN-protected\n- **Solution**: React Context + Protected Routes + JWT\n\n**3. Memory Constraints**\n- React production build needs 4GB RAM\n- Target server: 2GB DigitalOcean droplet\n- **Solution**: 2GB swap space + `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096`\n\n**4. Video Request Workflow**\n- Kids submit YouTube URLs (any video)\n- Parents see video details fetched from API\n- Approve → Video appears in search results\n- **Solution**: Stored in database with status tracking\n\n---\n\n## 📊 Database Schema\n```sql\napp_config         -- PIN storage\napi_keys          -- YouTube API key management\napproved_channels -- Whitelisted channels\nblocked_keywords  -- Content filters\nvideo_history     -- Watch tracking with duration\nvideo_requests    -- Request workflow (pending/approved/rejected)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Quick Start\n```bash\n# Clone repository\ngit clone https://github.com/limelightseychelles-git/kidstube-filter.git\ncd kidstube-filter\n\n# Setup backend\ncd backend\nnpm install\ncp .env.example .env\n# Edit .env with your database credentials\n\n# Setup database\ncreatedb kidstube_filter\npsql kidstube_filter < schema.sql\n\n# Start backend\nnpm run dev\n\n# Setup frontend (new terminal)\ncd frontend\nnpm install\nnpm start\n\n# Visit http://localhost:3000\n```\n\nFull setup instructions in [SETUP.md](https://github.com/limelightseychelles-git/kidstube-filter/blob/main/SETUP.md)\n\n---\n\n## 🤝 Looking For\n\n**Contributors:**\n- Code reviews and architectural feedback\n- Bug reports and fixes\n- Feature suggestions and PRs\n- Documentation improvements\n- Testing (unit, integration, e2e)\n\n**Potential Features:**\n- [ ] Mobile app (React Native)\n- [ ] Multi-family support (user accounts)\n- [ ] Screen time limits\n- [ ] Email notifications for parents\n- [ ] Export watch history reports\n- [ ] Support for other platforms (Vimeo, etc.)\n- [ ] Docker containerization\n- [ ] Kubernetes deployment configs\n\n**Current Contributors**: Just me so far! 😅\n\n---\n\n## 📝 License\n\n**MIT License** - Free to use, modify, and distribute.\n\nSee [LICENSE](https://github.com/limelightseychelles-git/kidstube-filter/blob/main/LICENSE) for details.\n\n---\n\n## 🙏 Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!

      "text": "Hey everyone, I’ve been working on Banish, and reached a stable release I'm confident in. Unlike traditional SM libraries, Banish evaluates rules within a state until no rule trigger (a fixed-point model) before transitioning. This allows complex rule-based behavior to be expressed declaratively without writing explicit enums or control loops. Additionally it compiles down to plain Rust, allowing seamless integration.\n\n```rust\nuse banish::banish;\n\nfn main() {\n    let buffer = [\"No\".to_string(), \"hey\".to_string()];\n    let target = \"hey\".to_string();\n    let idx = find_index(&buffer, &target);\n    print!(\"{:?}\", idx)\n}\n\nfn find_index(buffer: &[String], target: &str) -> Option<usize> {\n    let mut idx = 0;\n    banish! {\n        @search\n            // This must be first to prevent out-of-bounds panic below.\n            not_found ? idx >= buffer.len() {\n                return None;\n            }\n\n            found ? buffer[idx] != target {\n                idx += 1;\n            } !? { return Some(idx); }\n            // Rule triggered so we re-evalutate rules in search.\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIt being featured as Crate of the Week in the Rust newsletter has been encouraging, and I would love to hear your feedback.\n\nRelease page: https://github.com/LoganFlaherty/banish/releases/tag/v1.1.4\n\nThe project is licensed under MIT or Apache-2.0 and open to contributions.",
