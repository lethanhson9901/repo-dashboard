KeePass has a clunky way to share passwords with its AutoOpen feature and having a shared secondary database, but it doesn't translate well across all devices.\n\nI also really like the bitwarden capability of giving emergency access to your database. A trusted person can request access to your personal password database, and if you don't reject it within a certain timeframe, the server will give them access. Bitwarden implemented this in a way that keeps the server admin (ie themselves or whoever hosts the server) from being able to give themselves access, so everything remains encrypted end-to-end and at rest. [https://bitwarden.com/help/emergency-access/#how-it-works](https://bitwarden.com/help/emergency-access/#how-it-works)\n\nI really miss the keyboard switching on android and the 'share url' feature to explicitly initiate a search, as it's more reliable than Android requesting autofill.",

Before it was easier to assess an OSS library, but now certain signals that helped establish trust are getting ruined 😅\n\nMore so perhaps for SaaS springing up with APIs or community sites offering user uploads or storage of secrets / PII data. Stuff that I assume will become more common to lean into AI. Just recently a community service for sharing content was exposed to have an XSS vulnerability through SVG uploads that are displayed as a thumbnail for listing user content. That could run JS and steal authentication cookies due to being served from the same origin. Another was a desktop app that you let read your github data but it requested full write permissions that it shouldn't need.\n\nSome devs struggling to maintain more niche projects like libraries are leaning into AI (even if just for review and suggested changes) which is introducing subtle bugs / regressions as the advice sometimes isn't even questioned / discussed in public just applied and merged. More common when the change falls out of the author / reviewers (human) expertise, that they assume the AI probably knows better vs time to verify and grok bad advice.\n\nAI aside, these can still be relevant concerns. Some stuff can be faster by skipping functionality that can be important but not apparent on the surface. I've seen that on project announcements including new DBs from inexperienced devs that know just enough to make it seem like a plausible alternative until someone chimes in why it's significantly faster and how that can lead to data corruption or other concerns 😅",

              "text": "Community popularity is a bit of a tricky metric these days. Take `mise` for example. Lots of stars and community praise. \n\nThat's fully developed with heavy AI assist / workflows. The code base isn't particularly friendly to human contributors (_lots of repeated logic that should have been DRY and thus prone to diverging over time, especially from AI oriented development processes_).\n\nIts true that it's a great tool for the functionality as not many other options exist that can compete. However there are regressions and progressive NIH approach to remove external ecosystem integration to the authors own variant of a tool, one that manages secrets IIRC (`fnox`), yet confidently claiming it's security / trustworthy as if it should be right up there with projects from developers that specialise in that area of development.\n\nWorse the project uses CalVer when SemVer is far more appropriate for using a tool like that (eg: within CI workflows). This is favored to not worry about breaking changes (_which occurred often enough before I sifted through the project on github_), velocity is favored.\n\nPRs are regularly created with an AI summary and rarely any other context references for why the PR was created or decisions that were made.\n\nNo real review process, CI runs, some test suites fail and it merges. Github issues are disabled in favor of Github discussions, which the developer insisted was more appropriate (probably due to popularity / engagement). I feel that they're only OSS to help with adoption and leverage free compute like CI and AI tools that have free tiers for OSS projects, rather than embracing OSS community and practices.\n\nThats from an experienced / established dev too, not just an inexperienced vibe coder which would be far worse.\n\n---\n\nAnother example is a website that is OSS on github, again experienced dev (but like 40k commits in a year when they switched to using AI for development velocity).\n\nThey served user content from the same origin as authentication cookies, no sanitising of content like SVG for associating an image with a user upload (the site is for sharing community automation extensions and discovery).\n\nThis tool and site were quite popular, but a mistake like this permitted an attacker to use SVG for their extension page (which has that graphic appear in list views elsewhere),  running JS to steal authentication session and if that viewer that was compromised was logged in with any of their own extensions published they'd get modified with the same infection to spread and the attacker had access to a refresh token and provisioning of API tokens from this point. So they could publish these extensions with actual malware given the deployment environments access to additional resources and secrets which a much larger user base would consume (eg: for social media management or deploying servers).\n\nOne of their other projects did get a bug report about their app requesting full write permission token to github when it should only need limited read access scope. No engagement in weeks by the dev that continued to iterate on the project adding more features. Perhaps too much signal noise that they didn't even notice the report, or in their opinion it's not a concern? 🤷‍♂️\n\nPrivacy / security is important but even if that's claimed and is popular it's something we have to be more cautious about at face value. Especially if AI is leading that development, where some believe that just asking their AI tooling to perform reviews that ensure it respects those goals doesn't actually mean it can be trusted to deliver that properly 😅 (_but it will still be claimed to attract a demographic, even if the dev is well intentioned if they're not actively trying but just relying on implementation through delegation, they may feel confident that it is the truth whilst not knowing any better_)",

But the tools i found for my package manager didn't allow for much customization. So I tried some online qr code generator, which offered fancy design options. When I scanned the generated qr code, they led to some random URL that expired after a week unless I paid.  \nSo I took it upon myself to build a simple CLI tool that generates company branded QR codes, which could also be integrated into automation workflows. The next step was to generalize this tool by adding command options so anyone could customize their QR codes easily. That's how **QR Code Pretty** came to life.\n\nFor those wondering why I'm only promoting it only now (after 8 months): I just never got around to packaging it for easy installation...until now.\n\n  \nCheck out some pretty samples in my repo!",

      "text": "**What My Project Does**\n\nRevoDraw is a Python tool that lets you draw custom images on Revolut's card customization screen (the freeform drawing mode). It provides a web UI where you can:\n\n* Upload any image and convert it to drawable paths using edge detection (Canny, contours, adaptive thresholding)\n* Automatically detect the drawing boundaries from a phone screenshot using OpenCV\n* Preview, position, scale, rotate, and erase parts of your image\n* Execute the drawing on your phone via ADB swipe commands\n\nThe tool captures a screenshot via ADB, uses Hough line transforms to detect the dotted-line drawing boundaries (which form an L-shape with two exclusion zones), then converts your image to paths and sends `adb shell input swipe` commands to trace them.\n\n**Target Audience**\n\nThis is a fun side project / toy for Revolut users who want custom card designs without drawing by hand. It's also a decent example of practical OpenCV usage (edge detection, line detection, contour extraction) combined with ADB automation.\n\n**Comparison**\n\nI couldn't find any existing tools that do this. The alternatives are:\n\n* Drawing by hand on your phone (tedious, imprecise)\n* Using Revolut's preset designs (limited options)\n\nRevoDraw automates the tedious part while giving you full control over what gets drawn.\n\n**Tech stack:** Flask, OpenCV, NumPy, ADB\n\n**GitHub:** [https://github.com/K53N0/revodraw](https://github.com/K53N0/revodraw)\n\nThis started as a quick hack to draw something nice on my card without wasting the opportunity on my bad handwriting, then I went way overboard. Happy to answer questions about the OpenCV pipeline or ADB automation!\n\nP.S: I am already planning to expand support to more similar cases and will do so in the near future.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\n\n\nI never thought I’d be writing a post like this.\n\n\n\nI have spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy and use a power wheelchair. Typing and traditional coding are extremely difficult for me, and I don’t get out much physically, which is a big part of why I gravitated toward computers and technology in the first place. For most of my life, that meant “software developer” felt like a door that was permanently closed.\n\n\n\nI’ve always wanted to help people—especially people with disabilities who have to navigate software and the web in very different ways than able-bodied users. That motivation is a huge part of why this project exists. I didn’t just want to make something faster for myself; I wanted to build something that respects different bodies, different inputs, and different ways of interacting with computers.\n\n\n\nI’m also a video creator—and I was getting crushed by render times. A 6-minute GoPro clip taking 8+ hours in Shutter Encoder (sometimes much longer) was just not sustainable. So instead of waiting for existing tools to improve, I decided to try building something myself.\n\n\n\nI used AI tools to help write the code, but I designed the system, defined the features, debugged the pipeline, tested performance, and drove the entire architecture.\n\n\n\nIntroducing FastEncode Pro\n\n\n\nAn open-source, GPU-accelerated video editor and encoder built with accessibility and performance as first-class goals.\n\n\n\nWhat it does today:\n\n\n\nNVIDIA NVENC GPU-accelerated rendering (properly fed, sustained encode)\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GPU decoding (NVDEC) is already implemented\n\n\n\nTimeline-based video editing (multiple clips, full timeline duration)\n\n\n\nNoise reduction (especially tuned for noisy GoPro footage)\n\n\n\nDeflicker for indoor/LED lighting\n\n\n\nDeterministic CBR encoding (bitrate is actually respected)\n\n\n\nProject save & load\n\n\n\nDark UI (because my eyes deserve mercy)\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility features (in active development):\n\n\n\nDwell clicking (currently broken at startup)\n\n\n\nEye gaze support (code exists but is not yet fully wired in)\n\n\n\nAAC device and switch-based interaction (foundation is in place)\n\n\n\nVisual focus highlighting\n\n\n\nAccessibility settings panel for configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\\> Important note:\n\nRight now, the branch that includes dwell clicking / eye gaze does not open the program at startup. This does not affect the rendering engine or encode pipeline—the bug is isolated to application initialization. I’m actively fixing this and will not tag a stable release until startup is solid again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance:\n\n\n\nA 6-minute clip that took 8+ hours in Shutter Encoder now renders in \\~15–20 minutes, even with heavy filters enabled\n\n\n\nA 10-minute 5K render completes in \\~25–30 minutes on my system\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s coming next:\n\n\n\nFixing accessibility startup logic (dwell / gaze init order)\n\n\n\nFinalizing accessibility filter → render handoff\n\n\n\nMKV video input fixes\n\n\n\nTimeline auto-follow improvements\n\n\n\nUI/UX modernization (it works great, but yeah… it looks a bit 1990s right now)\n\n\n\nWindows support and packaging\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project is free and open source: 👉 [https://github.com/cpgplays/FastEncodePro](https://github.com/cpgplays/FastEncodePro)\n\n\n\nThis is my first real software project. I didn’t “just prompt an AI and walk away”—This took everything I had: constantly debugging, complete program breakages, and deep emotional breakdowns. and learning how video pipelines actually work. \n\nI’m sharing it because:\n\n\n\nI want faster, more honest video tools\n\n\n\nI want accessibility baked in, not bolted on\n\n\n\nI want to help both able-bodied creators and creators with disabilities\n\n\n\nAnd I want other people to be able to build on this\n\n\n\n\n\nFeedback, issues, and contributions are genuinely welcome.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading—and thanks to the open-source community for being the kind of place where someone like me can finally release Something that is actually built for everyone.  ",

Git is in a category of software literally called “Version Control System” (VCS), and GitHub is a web-based UI and repository for it with project management, CI/CD, and social features baked in.\n\nA “commit” is is essentially a version - you’re making a new commit every time you add a file with the way you’re doing it — but you’re also making a commit each time you edit one, too. That’s the important point - each commit is a snapshot in time of what your code looked like at that point.\n\nTagging and branching are the typical ways to keep track of release versions. Projects with linear releases (like a website, for example) where the latest version is the only one intended to be used can do just fine using tagging only. However, for software projects released to the public, a combined approach has advantages: a common workflow is to create a new branch for every major version (1.x, 2.x, etc.) and then use tagging on those branches to designate minor or patch versions (v1.1.0, v1.1.1, etc.) This allows you to make a new major-version release (say, v2.0) while also being able to easily make changes to the 1.x branch to continue to release bug fixes and such as new minor or patch versions.",

Currently it supports JPG, PNG, WEBP, AVIF, QOI, JXL compression and gives you fully lossless or customizable lossy options as well.\n\nThere are no ads, cookies or trackers and it supports different resizing modes, color reduction, strip EXIF metadata, customizable parallel processing, side by side image comparison and more.\n\nIt uses WebAssembly, so all things happens in your browser. No images are ever uploaded to a server. It also uses WASM for near native performance compared to standard JS based compression.\n\nOther similar websites like Squoosh doesn’t support batch uploads and most of their forks that do support it still has the same problem with Squoosh where you cant compress because of an “Out of memory” error.\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts on the compression quality, any feature suggestions for it, or the UI.",

Pacta supports baseline mode, so you can prevent new violations without fixing the entire past first.\n\nThis tool is Git + tests + metrics for architecture.\n\n---\n\n## Brief Guide\n\n1. Install and define your architecture model:\n\n```bash\npip install pacta\n```\n\nCreate an `architecture.yml` describing your architecture.\n\n2. Save a snapshot of the current state:\n\n```bash\npacta snapshot save . --model architecture.yml\n```\n\n3. Inspect history:\n\n```bash\npacta history show --last 5\n```\n\nExample:\n\n```\nTIMESTAMP            SNAPSHOT    NODES  EDGES  VIOLATIONS\n2024-01-22 14:30:00  f7a3c2...   48     82     0\n2024-01-15 10:00:00  abc123...   45     78     0\n```\n\nTrack trends (e.g., dependency count / edges):\n\n```bash\npacta history trends . --metric edges\n```\n\nExample:\n\n```\nEdge Count Trend (5 entries)\n============================\n\n 82 │                              ●\n    │               ●--------------\n 79 │    ●----------\n    │\n 76 ├●---\n    └────────────────────────────────\n      Jan 15                   Jan 22\n\nTrend: ↑ Increasing (+6 over period)\nFirst: 76 edges (Jan 15)\nLast:  82 edges (Jan 22)\n\nAverage: 79 edges\nMin: 76, Max: 82\n```\n\n4. Enforce architectural rules (`rules.pacta.yml`):\n\n```bash\n# Option A: Check an existing snapshot\npacta check . --rules rules.pacta.yml\n\n# Option B: Snapshot + check in one step\npacta scan . --model architecture.yml --rules rules.pacta.yml\n```\n\nExample violation output:\n\n```\n✗ 2 violations (2 error) [2 new]\n\n  ✗ ERROR [no_domain_to_infra] @ src/domain/user.py:3:1\n    status: new\n    Domain layer must not import from Infrastructure\n```\n\nIf you want to contribute or try project please refer to these links:\n\n**Code:** https://github.com/pacta-dev/pacta-cli\n\n**Docs:** https://pacta-dev.github.io/pacta-cli/getting-started/\n",

But I decided to share this with the community here.\n\n**Preface:**  \nI often have to diff sensitive docs, .env files, json/xml/text etc and I'm always a bit weary of those websites out there that do line-by-line diffing. I want something that is easily visible and I wanted something that is completely self contained and doesn't use external APIs etc\n\n**Techstack:**  \nI built this using Go 1.25.1, Gin-gonic, zerolog, html/template and bootstrap\n\nBootstrap 5 CSS/JS is compiled with it so that its completely self-contained, and not reaching out to CDNs for offline deployments.\n\n*I've also just added Sonic Cache, another (FOSS) package I wrote for a FIFO cache system to support 'magic links' which can be triggered from a githook. The Git hook work is still experimental but so far from what I've tested, works well*\n\nI've also got some *very basic* content awareness, it uses JS to switch between JSON, XML and text when you paste in content in text field A.\n\n**Build & Run?**  \nI've got it setup using Go-releaser and Docker so it builds when I tag out new versions so that you can run it compiled (but I need to get the executables signed), on a home lab/docker stack/server with a container, or you can build it from scratch on your own machine.\n\n**Roadmap:**\n\n* Node sorting for XML and JSON, this should aid with those cases where JSON/XML nodes are autogenerated and content is then shuffled\n* Random white-space lines being populated in comparisons on XML\n* Further git-hook testing\n* Encoding UIs\n   * Base64 encode/decoding\n   * Sha-256 encode/comparison\n* Java / Spring MVC version (WIP https://github.com/jroden2/holmes-java)\n\n**Repo**\nhttps://github.com/jroden2/holmes-go\n\n**Screenshots**\n\nhttps://github.com/jroden2/holmes-go/blob/main/Screenshot%202026-01-26%20at%2010.37.54.png\n\nhttps://github.com/jroden2/holmes-go/blob/main/Screenshot%202026-01-26%20at%2010.38.24.png\n\nhttps://github.com/jroden2/holmes-go/blob/main/Screenshot%202026-01-26%20at%2010.38.35.png",

Are you using this Java port in another Java application, or something like that? For end-user, the Go package is enough, I think.",
