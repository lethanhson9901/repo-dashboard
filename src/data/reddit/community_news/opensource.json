The problem isn't AI-assisted PRs specifically — it's low-effort drive-by contributions from people who don't understand the codebase. AI just made it cheaper to produce them at scale.\n\n  \nThe most practical suggestions from that thread:\n\n  \n\\- \\*\\*Require a linked issue before opening a PR\\*\\* — this is the single highest-signal filter. It forces contributors to communicate intent before writing code, and maintainers can close issues they don't want worked on. Most slop PRs are unsolicited \"improvements\" nobody asked for.\n\n\\- \\*\\*Restrict PRs from first-time contributors until CI passes\\*\\* — don't even notify maintainers until the PR at least builds and passes lint. This alone would kill most of the spray-and-pray submissions.\n\n\\- \\*\\*PR deletion from UI\\*\\* — the fact that maintainers still can't delete PRs (only close them) is genuinely baffling. Closed slop PRs still pollute search results and project history.\n\n  \nThe AI detection angle is a dead end though. You can't reliably distinguish AI-assisted code from human code, and you shouldn't need to — the quality bar should be the same regardless of how the code was produced. A well-crafted AI-assisted PR that follows contribution guidelines, links to an issue, and includes tests is fine. A sloppy human PR that ignores [CONTRIBUTING.md](http://CONTRIBUTING.md) is equally bad.\n\n  \nWhat maintainers actually need is better gatekeeping tools, not AI detectors.",

Other than that, it's just an arms race of heuristics.\n\nI mean... think like an attacker. How would you defeat these if you wanted to just automatically spam PRs everywhere?\n\n> Require a linked issue before opening a PR\n\nCool, I'll have the chatbot open a linked issue first. Exact same slop problem in two places at once.\n\n> Restrict PRs from first-time contributors until CI passes\n\nThis could raise quality, but ultimately I'd just tell the chatbot to keep trying until the tests pass.

Parm will then extract the files, find the proper binaries, and then add them to your PATH. Parm can also check for updates and uninstall software, and otherwise manages the entire lifecycle of all software installed by Parm.\n\nParm is not meant to replace your system's package manager. It is instead meant as an alternative method to install prebuilt software off of GitHub in a more centralized and simpler way.\n\nIt's currently in a pre-release stage, but I'm working on a v0.2.0 milestone, though there's still some work to do. If this sounds interesting to you, check it out! It's completely free and open-source and is currently released for Linux/macOS (Windows coming soon). I would appreciate any feedback.\n\nLink: [https://github.com/yhoundz/parm](https://github.com/yhoundz/parm)",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\n\n\nI never thought I’d be writing a post like this.\n\n\n\nI have spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy and use a power wheelchair. Typing and traditional coding are extremely difficult for me, and I don’t get out much physically, which is a big part of why I gravitated toward computers and technology in the first place. For most of my life, that meant “software developer” felt like a door that was permanently closed.\n\n\n\nI’ve always wanted to help people—especially people with disabilities who have to navigate software and the web in very different ways than able-bodied users. That motivation is a huge part of why this project exists. I didn’t just want to make something faster for myself; I wanted to build something that respects different bodies, different inputs, and different ways of interacting with computers.\n\n\n\nI’m also a video creator—and I was getting crushed by render times. A 6-minute GoPro clip taking 8+ hours in Shutter Encoder (sometimes much longer) was just not sustainable. So instead of waiting for existing tools to improve, I decided to try building something myself.\n\n\n\nI used AI tools to help write the code, but I designed the system, defined the features, debugged the pipeline, tested performance, and drove the entire architecture.\n\n\n\nIntroducing FastEncode Pro\n\n\n\nAn open-source, GPU-accelerated video editor and encoder built with accessibility and performance as first-class goals.\n\n\n\nWhat it does today:\n\n\n\nNVIDIA NVENC GPU-accelerated rendering (properly fed, sustained encode)\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GPU decoding (NVDEC) is already implemented\n\n\n\nTimeline-based video editing (multiple clips, full timeline duration)\n\n\n\nNoise reduction (especially tuned for noisy GoPro footage)\n\n\n\nDeflicker for indoor/LED lighting\n\n\n\nDeterministic CBR encoding (bitrate is actually respected)\n\n\n\nProject save & load\n\n\n\nDark UI (because my eyes deserve mercy)\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility features (in active development):\n\n\n\nDwell clicking (currently broken at startup)\n\n\n\nEye gaze support (code exists but is not yet fully wired in)\n\n\n\nAAC device and switch-based interaction (foundation is in place)\n\n\n\nVisual focus highlighting\n\n\n\nAccessibility settings panel for configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\\> Important note:\n\nRight now, the branch that includes dwell clicking / eye gaze does not open the program at startup. This does not affect the rendering engine or encode pipeline—the bug is isolated to application initialization. I’m actively fixing this and will not tag a stable release until startup is solid again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance:\n\n\n\nA 6-minute clip that took 8+ hours in Shutter Encoder now renders in \\~15–20 minutes, even with heavy filters enabled\n\n\n\nA 10-minute 5K render completes in \\~25–30 minutes on my system\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s coming next:\n\n\n\nFixing accessibility startup logic (dwell / gaze init order)\n\n\n\nFinalizing accessibility filter → render handoff\n\n\n\nMKV video input fixes\n\n\n\nTimeline auto-follow improvements\n\n\n\nUI/UX modernization (it works great, but yeah… it looks a bit 1990s right now)\n\n\n\nWindows support and packaging\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project is free and open source: 👉 [https://github.com/cpgplays/FastEncodePro](https://github.com/cpgplays/FastEncodePro)\n\n\n\nThis is my first real software project. I didn’t “just prompt an AI and walk away”—This took everything I had: constantly debugging, complete program breakages, and deep emotional breakdowns. and learning how video pipelines actually work. \n\nI’m sharing it because:\n\n\n\nI want faster, more honest video tools\n\n\n\nI want accessibility baked in, not bolted on\n\n\n\nI want to help both able-bodied creators and creators with disabilities\n\n\n\nAnd I want other people to be able to build on this\n\n\n\n\n\nFeedback, issues, and contributions are genuinely welcome.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading—and thanks to the open-source community for being the kind of place where someone like me can finally release Something that is actually built for everyone.  ",

Git is in a category of software literally called “Version Control System” (VCS), and GitHub is a web-based UI and repository for it with project management, CI/CD, and social features baked in.\n\nA “commit” is is essentially a version - you’re making a new commit every time you add a file with the way you’re doing it — but you’re also making a commit each time you edit one, too. That’s the important point - each commit is a snapshot in time of what your code looked like at that point.\n\nTagging and branching are the typical ways to keep track of release versions. Projects with linear releases (like a website, for example) where the latest version is the only one intended to be used can do just fine using tagging only. However, for software projects released to the public, a combined approach has advantages: a common workflow is to create a new branch for every major version (1.x, 2.x, etc.) and then use tagging on those branches to designate minor or patch versions (v1.1.0, v1.1.1, etc.) This allows you to make a new major-version release (say, v2.0) while also being able to easily make changes to the 1.x branch to continue to release bug fixes and such as new minor or patch versions.",

      "text": "**What My Project Does**\n\nRevoDraw is a Python tool that lets you draw custom images on Revolut's card customization screen (the freeform drawing mode). It provides a web UI where you can:\n\n* Upload any image and convert it to drawable paths using edge detection (Canny, contours, adaptive thresholding)\n* Automatically detect the drawing boundaries from a phone screenshot using OpenCV\n* Preview, position, scale, rotate, and erase parts of your image\n* Execute the drawing on your phone via ADB swipe commands\n\nThe tool captures a screenshot via ADB, uses Hough line transforms to detect the dotted-line drawing boundaries (which form an L-shape with two exclusion zones), then converts your image to paths and sends `adb shell input swipe` commands to trace them.\n\n**Target Audience**\n\nThis is a fun side project / toy for Revolut users who want custom card designs without drawing by hand. It's also a decent example of practical OpenCV usage (edge detection, line detection, contour extraction) combined with ADB automation.\n\n**Comparison**\n\nI couldn't find any existing tools that do this. The alternatives are:\n\n* Drawing by hand on your phone (tedious, imprecise)\n* Using Revolut's preset designs (limited options)\n\nRevoDraw automates the tedious part while giving you full control over what gets drawn.\n\n**Tech stack:** Flask, OpenCV, NumPy, ADB\n\n**GitHub:** [https://github.com/K53N0/revodraw](https://github.com/K53N0/revodraw)\n\nThis started as a quick hack to draw something nice on my card without wasting the opportunity on my bad handwriting, then I went way overboard. Happy to answer questions about the OpenCV pipeline or ADB automation!\n\nP.S: I am already planning to expand support to more similar cases and will do so in the near future.",

That made me want to try binaural beats again, so your project’s timing is perfect. One feature I’d like is to be able to modulate both oscillators with LFOs to give evolving soundscapes.  mynoise.net kinda lets you do this but without the granular control yours could.

MPL2 draws the line at the file level — you can combine MPL2 files with proprietary files in the same project, but modifications to MPL2 files stay open. In practice MPL2 is more permissive than LGPL for most use cases because the file boundary is easier to work around than the linking boundary. If you want something stronger than MPL2 but less viral than full GPL, LGPL is probably what you're looking for. What's the project and what are you trying to protect?",
