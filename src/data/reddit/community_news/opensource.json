Once Red Hat pulled the plug and moved its developers to other projects, development basically ceased.\n\nFor companies to realize value from open sourcing their products, they need dedicated contributors from outside the company.  Thus, if they close source it, they lose some of their key developers.  This creates an incentive to keep it open source.  But if the company is doing all of the development, then they don’t need the software to remain open source.\n\nBut this really only works when the product adds a lot of value on top of the software.  Kubernetes is massively complex.  Few people use the plain upstream version.  They turn to vendorized versions because the vendors make it easier to install, update, and manage and then add more tooling on top (like OpenShift does).",

          "text": "Running AGPL and enforcing that it actually means something is an absolutely fine 100% ethical stance for an open-source company to make, IMHO.\n\nFirst, **license enforcement is fine**. If you don't enforce your license, what even is the point of talking about the silly things anyways? They become meaningless paragraphs. Linux' GPL has often been the only thing to ever make companies play ball in the open ecosystem, and that has been through enforcement or threats of such. Not everyone starts off as a happy, compliant & collaborative partner in the FOSS spirit, some people/companies have to learn the hard way.\n\nSecond, **AGPL is fine**. Especially for a open-source company. It requires that people that only \"take\" to at least contribute back if they want to make their own improvements. Rather than just take-take-take with abandon, like an MIT or BSD encourages. The only way an OSS company can survive with an MIT project is if they *know* they can rely on support contracts, and not every OSS project is a good fit for that model. AGPL at least enforces that you be a cooperative player even in the server space. If you use an AGPL project as-is, then license compliance is a cinch anyway; just declare that you use it as-is and point back to the OG repo or a tarball of it that you last used in your build.\n\nHowever, I'd regard any company trying to close-up their project afterwards with the same disdain as anyone else. Eh, well, your profitable-FOSS experiment failed after all the investment rounds, nice rug pull. Go join the pile of disreputable companies doing the same.\n\nI mainly hate to see a perfectly reasonable license such as AGPL get caught in the crossfire. If any company-backed FOSS project is going to survive, I'd say using something like AGPL for that is one of best chances you can give it. It only asks that everyone using the project code keeps all their own code versions of it open as well. Seems pretty FOSS spirit to me.\n\nThe only thing I think people need to start learning is not to expect miraculous-foss-software-maintained-by-VC-funded-companies to be free lunches for any more than a few years. I expect there will be far far more failed experiments that end in collapse or rug-pulls than success stories.",

It's also totally valid for their former customers to decide that the product isn't worth what they're asking and rebuild it.\n\nWhat's definitely not valid is for big companies to use software in a way that contravenes that software's license.

S3 compatibility was non-negotiable, and MinIO was *everywhere* in our evaluation. Every Reddit thread, every Stack Overflow answer, every \"self-hosted object storage\" search pointed to MinIO.\n\nThe trust was real. Apache 2.0, billion Docker pulls, CNCF association. It looked like the kind of dependency you could build on for years.\n\nThen came the AGPL change, the admin console gutting, the Docker image removal. We dodged a bullet by going with a different approach, but watching this unfold is sobering.\n\nWhat bothers me most isn't the monetization — companies need revenue. It's the *execution*. Locking GitHub discussions mid-crisis. Removing binaries during a CVE disclosure. Turning a billion-pull community into a $96K/year toll booth without a migration path for the people who evangelized you into existence.\n\nThe article's comparison table is brutal but fair: MinIO is the only company that climbed all six levels of the escalation ladder. MongoDB, Elastic, HashiCorp, Redis — they all made controversial moves, but they stopped somewhere. MinIO kept going.\n\nFor anyone evaluating dependencies now: the lesson isn't \"avoid open-source.\" It's \"watch the cap table.\" When SoftBank Vision Fund shows up with a $103M check at a billion-dollar valuation, the incentive structure fundamentally changes. Patient capital (foundations, bootstrapping) aligns with community health. Growth capital demands returns on timelines that community goodwill can't deliver.\n\nSeaweedFS and Garage are looking solid as alternatives, but neither has MinIO's decade of battle-testing. We're all rebuilding trust from scratch because one company decided the community was the product to extract, not the asset to steward.\n\nOpen core isn't inherently evil. But MinIO's playbook — build trust with permissive licensing, raise massive VC, then systematically dismantle the free tier while locking tickets and removing distribution — is a masterclass in how to burn a billion Docker pulls worth of goodwill in 18 months.",

The fundamental tension they faced — balancing community goodwill against revenue pressure — is something every open-source-turned-commercial project grapples with.\n\nWhat's striking isn't that they made the pivot, but *how* they did it. Systematically dismantling features over 18 months while the community watched creates exactly the kind of trust erosion you can't recover from. Compare this to how Redis handled their licensing change: controversial, yes, but transparent and decisive.\n\nThe lesson I've taken from watching these plays out: if you're going to change the rules, do it once, clearly communicate why, and give people a real migration path. Death by a thousand cuts (like MinIO's approach) just breeds resentment without the upside of a clean business model transition.\n\nCurious what alternatives people moved to?

That thought alone was enough to make me uncomfortable about uploading private files to closed-source web services.\n\nSo as a small personal project, I built [pdfer](https://github.com/syedinsaf/pdfer), a minimal fully open-source local PDF utility written in Rust. Currently supports merging and splitting PDFs via a simple terminal interface, with a GUI and more PDF operations planned.\n\nNot meant to replace anything (yet), just a privacy-first alternative for those who prefer keeping documents fully offline.

Here are a few of my favourites that I have used extensively, and which are totally online.  \n\nPDF Arranger.  This is a windows freeware gui that has all but replaced the original PDFtk (PDF Toolkit) (command line for windows, linux, MacOS) that has been around for 20-some years and PDFtk Builder, a freeware Windows GUI frontend. PDF Arranger allows drag and drop and a visual representation of pages, allowing for a more intuitive usage.\n\nCoherent PDF (cPDF) by /u/jwhitington. This is a command line freeware for windows, linux, MacOS that is more powerful that PDFtk and PDF Arranger combined, is fast, works with the largest PDFs I have ever used with it, but doesn't have the GUI aspects of PDF Arranger.\n\nThe above are used for merging, splitting, watermarking, cropping, compression, metadata, bookmarks, etc.  the cPDF manual is 162 intensive pages. All are offline, and freeware.  There are a whole bunch of single- or few-function tools that I use as well as specific task functions that I would mention.\n\nIrfanview for windows with the Plugins Package (for the PDF plugin). Irfanview is a favourite raster image processor that I have used professionally as well as personally for over 25 years (personally using it as freeware but no functional difference), and for 3 years or so had PDF capabilities.  It is great for cleaning up muddy scanned pdfs, changing page sizes, and other alterations that more akin to image processing. For these, look at /r/pdf, or www.portablefreeware.com, where windows freeware enthusiasts put programs through their paces.\n\nNote: I just realized this is /r/opensource and not /r/pdf, where you can find many tutorials on specific uses of the above and other programs.  I don't specifically look at programs for opensource, only that I can verify its origin, function, that it is fully offline, and if shareware or commercial I pay for it.",

Zulip works well for communities that prefer threaded conversations over real-time chat. The tradeoff: Matrix has the best protocol and federation story but Element's UI feels heavier than Discord. Revolt has a snappier UI but less deployment flexibility. If you're moving an existing Discord community, the hardest part isn't the software—it's convincing everyone to install another app. Export your Discord message history first, and consider running a Matrix bridge so people can participate from Discord while you transition. Makes migration gradual instead of forcing a hard cutover.",

Diversity is cool and projects like Sharkord are really impressive for a one-man-show. But overall, open source is held back because 1000s of people will build 100s of decent tools, but not enough teams come together to build ONE truly great alternative.\n\nSomehow reminds me of the early Rebels in Andor.

There is a downside of your ip being exposed however using a proxy or bouncer or whatever will get around that. There’s tons of existing servers with cool and weird channels to explore. I use irssi but other common clients are hex chat or libera chat. There are also online irc clients that can hide your ip. \n\nI like IRC because you control all of the important aspects, I can spoof my ip, don’t have to authenticate with any bs, can change who I am at any time, unless the server has it you don’t have to password or username. It’s just good old Internet fun! Plus lots of super smart people hang out on there because it has a niche-ness to it nowadays. Check out the IRC subreddit\n\nIRC IS TEXT ONLY! No vc and no images",

AI agent PR activity is going to become a major headache for maintainers and security professionals, I suspect, if it isn't already.\n\nThis seems like full-on cyberwarfare hiding in plain sight. Maintainers will probably have to adopt (to some extent) the attitude of a military or intelligence service, and maybe make use of their techniques or know-how in order to come to grips with how to uncover and deal with AI agent \"contributors\". \n\nIt's espionage. An agent (AI or otherwise) presents itself as a real human user, infiltrates the ecosystem following normal processes and standards in order to blend in with other users. Once their \"contributor\" identity has been established, they start doing their real - and more nefarious - work.\n\nThis is *not* going to be easy to deal with, especially for maintainers that are probably just trying to publish useful programs to benefit human society in general, and probably don't have the necessary training or experience in security/intelligence/military-type matters that they'll need to deal with this. This could become a rather large barrier to entry for new maintainers.\n\nSource: my ass sitting in my armchair right now. I'm no professional, but this is how the situation looks to me.",

Would be great to see a standard app being tested across different frameworks.",

Their rationale is that most developers know Typescript/React, so why write TUI using low level language. But then you get slow ass React-In-Terminal solution.\n\nThere are many proper TUI frameworks in languages such as Go, Rust, et cetera.\n\nSo I decided to give it a shot and make TUI framework with Typescript, but one that is actually fast. \n\nThere is lots of functionality so I will be testing it a lot more in coming weeks and improving / bug fixing it  ",

It’s built with performance, reliability, and horizontal scalability in mind, making it a strong fit for backend systems that depend on on-chain data.\n\n**Why it matters**\n\nMany existing block scanners are heavy, highly opinionated, or not designed for real-world backend architectures. This service focuses on:\n\n• Real-time block ingestion via WebSocket subscriptions  \n• Partition-aware Kafka publishing with effectively-once delivery semantics  \n• Reorg awareness, emitting tombstone and update events on chain reorganizations  \n• Durable coordination using Redis markers  \n• Observability with structured logs, metrics, and traces\n\n**Who might find it useful**\n\n• Go developers building Web3 backends  \n• Teams designing custom Ethereum data pipelines  \n• Anyone integrating blockchain data into event-driven systems\n\nIf you check it out and find it useful, I’d truly appreciate a **star** on the repo.  \nHappy to answer questions or discuss the design and architecture!",
