I've asked them if they got this \"solution\" from an LLM and no one ever wants to admit it. I try to be careful and respectful, as I don't like bashing people's code as some junior devs often write sloppy solutions but I enjoy helping them and accepting their PR and showing them how I clean it up better, like a teachable moment. I rarely see this now at all.\n\nI love using AI as a dev myself. It csn save me a lot of time, but people often think they have a solution but it's not. For example, a recent PR I got did not fix a reported bug that popped up when parent software updated (mine is a popular plugin). I was busy for the weekend so didn't get an instant fix out. The solution I was sent was just something that check input type and if not valid, boolean gated the whole function away. It didn't resolve the source of the bug, or ask the question \"Why am I getting null data on this API call I am passing into my function when before I didn't?\" It didn't ask what downstream side effects or problems would it cause not running this function. They just felt it was a solution because they prevented the bug from showing up, when it would be a big problem in many other conditions as this was critical infrastructure. True source of issue was just they moved the API into a different namespace and I got that by reading release note docs thst came out days back, and there is no way any trained LLM would have access to.\n\nWhat happened? I chatted with the dude who submitted PR about it and he finally admitted to me he used Gemini 3 pro and told me that the AI was smarter than me and I shouldn't be so arrogant and that I just didn't want to give him credit for a fix when I rejected the PR.\n\nSo ya, I don't blame the Curl team at all.",

The fact that they are aggressively trying to grab phones it would need to resist tampering if the phone was confiscated while unlocked, maybe a password to stop recording or a way to fake deleting if under duress.

(And also, self-hosting GitLab sucks.)\n\nForgejo and Gitea are not GitHub-style project hosting services, but software for (self-)hosting repositories.\n\nCodeberg is a Forgejo instance that's open to the public. However, Codeberg e.V. has certain goals. Public repos MUST have a FOSS license, and private repos are discouraged. This is a lot less flexible than what GitHub and GitLab give you.\n\nSelf-hosting is *not* the solution to all our problems. Hosting software responsibly requires continuous maintenance and monitoring. For most software, self-hosting also prevents the formation of community, as self-hosted instances are too small to develop network effects.

      "text": "Hi r/opensource,\n\nI recently needed a webcam for my desktop but didn't want to buy new hardware when my phone's camera is already 4K-capable. I looked at the popular solutions (DroidCam, iVCam, Camo), but I was frustrated by the common \"freemium\" patterns: watermarks, low-resolution limits, ads, and closed-source binaries.\n\nSo, I decided to build **VCamdroid**—a completely free, open-source, and privacy-friendly alternative.\n\n**The Project:** It allows you to stream your Android camera to your Windows PC and use it as a native input in apps like OBS, Zoom, and Discord.\n\n**The Tech Stack (The fun part):**\n\n* **Android App (Server):** Uses `Camera2` API and `MediaCodec` to encode a hardware-accelerated H.264 RTSP stream.\n* **Windows Client (Receiver):** Written in **C++** with **wxWidgets**. It uses **FFmpeg** to decode the stream with low latency.\n* **Virtual Driver:** Implements a **DirectShow** filter (based on `Softcam`) to register the video stream as a system-wide virtual device.\n* **Transport:** Supports standard Wi-Fi or **USB tunneling** (via ADB port forwarding) for a lag-free wired connection.\n\n**Why I'm sharing it here:**\n\n1. **No Bloat:** No ads, no tracking, no \"Pro\" subscription.\n2. **Local Only:** The video stream never leaves your local network (or USB cable).\n3. **MIT License:** You can fork it, break it, or build upon it.\n\nI’m currently looking for feedback on the Windows installer and the latency performance on different devices. If you have C++ or Android experience, I’d love to see some PRs (especially for audio support!).\n\n**Repo:** [https://github.com/darusc/VCamdroid](https://github.com/darusc/VCamdroid)",

Quickbooks for example lowest tiered plan is around $35.\n\nSince syncing transactions is free as long as you stay under 100 accounts.

      "text": "It appears that the developer of [Borderless Gaming](https://store.steampowered.com/app/388080/Borderless_Gaming/) used Magpie’s code and is selling it as his own software in violation of the GPLv3, while rejecting all accusations\n\nOn [Magpie’s GitHub page](https://github.com/Blinue/Magpie/issues/1367), a large amount of evidence is accumulating showing that the Borderless Gaming developer used Magpie’s GPLv3 code to create a new “reimagined after 11 years” version that is being sold on Steam. This would not be an issue if the license terms were respected. Instead, the Borderless Gaming developer dismisses all accusations, claims the code is his own, and comes up with excuse after excuse for every new piece of evidence\n\nAt first, he had no choice but to admit that all Borderless Gaming shaders are derivatives of Magpie’s shaders, because they are not just similar, but 100% identical, except that MagpieFX was renamed to BGFX. You can literally use a Magpie shader without any changes and it will work. To avoid the implications of the GPLv3 license, which would force him to open-source all of Borderless Gaming, he claims that he created an “aggregate” under Section 5, and that the shaders shipped with the program are an independent product and have nothing to do with his application, which he claims is 100% his own and does not use Magpie’s code\n\nEven this single episode does not stand up to any criticism, because under the same license an “aggregate” must not form a larger program, and in this case it clearly does. Without the shaders, Borderless Gaming is just a non-functional shell and would not have the long list of features introduced in this “reimagined” update. Moreover, despite admitting that all shaders were taken from Magpie, all references to Magpie were removed. No copyright notice, no license reference, nothing. Instead, MagpieFX was renamed to BGFX to create the impression that this is his own development\n\nAs for the binary part of the program, it likely contains the entirety of Magpie’s code, since all or most of Magpie’s class names were found in it. However, the developer categorically denies this, because admitting it would require releasing the entire product’s source code. This stance is very convenient, given that everything was compiled into a binary format and he appears confident that no one has proof. According to him, the class names are merely a coincidence, since the program performs similar functions and there is only one correct way to implement them\n\nTo support his claims, he published the source code of one class, apparently to demonstrate that it was written in a different language, C# versus C++. However, the Magpie developer recognized it as his own code, stating that the entire class, including its structure, control flow, and variable names, was simply ported to C#, which is unquestionably a derivative work\n\nLater, new evidence emerged, this time showing that some Magpie shaders, which are not effects but internal shaders, were fully embedded into the Borderless Gaming binary as plain text. These shaders matched 100%, including variable names and even some fairly unique numeric constants, and also contained comments that were obviously generated by an LLM. This time, the Borderless Gaming developer claimed that the code was supposedly well documented and that he found it on Stack Overflow. When asked to provide the documentation or links to Stack Overflow, he refused, claiming that life is short. His comments explaining why the shader code matched 100% also appear absurd, as if he does not understand what the code is or what it does\n\nThe Magpie developer, on the other hand, stated that this part of his program is poorly documented and that the code is his personal creation, developed through trial and error. Some comments also reveal interesting facts about the Borderless Gaming developer. For example, that he sells a 7 euro program that simply enables file system compression, presenting it as his own compression method. Or that he claims to be the developer of the Rainway service, which was supposedly sold to Microsoft. However, there is no confirmation of this from the company.\n\nThe Magpie developer was advised to contact Valve with this information, clearly suggesting filing a DMCA notice. What he will do next is currently unknown. In the meantime, I decided to share my findings with a wider audience to bring public attention to the matter. It is also possible that someone may be able to gather additional evidence\n\nTldr: The developer of Borderless Gaming has a history of being dishonest and using LLMs. His latest app update is not a clean-room rewrite. He is reusing GPL code, removing attribution, ignoring licensing, and choosing to gaslight others, instead of answering questions\n\nSource: [https://github.com/Blinue/Magpie/issues/1367](https://github.com/Blinue/Magpie/issues/1367)\n\nSteampage: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/388080/Borderless\\_Gaming/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/388080/Borderless_Gaming/)",

Testing a localhost API shouldn’t need an internet connection.\n\nSo we asked a simple question: What if an API tool respected how developers already work?\n\nThat led to a few core ideas:\n\n  \\- Offline-first, no accounts, no telemetry\n\n  \\- Git as the source of truth\n\n  \\- Specs, tests, and docs living together in Markdown\n\nWe opensourced Voiden because extensibility without openness just shifts the bottleneck.\n\nIf workflows should be transparent, the tool should be too.\n\nTake a look here : https://github.com/VoidenHQ/voiden",

Where as Postman (and yours) has a User interface for playing back sets of interactions with a remote (real) service, Servirtium does not. Servirtium can (under test-automation control) a] record real web-APIs into source control, b] play those back for faster build/test loops, c] have an early warning system that an \"upstream\" team may have changed the web-API.\n\nYour docs would be even better if an example of a markdown recording were available for the casual evaluator (like me) to see :)  Keep up the good work",

I’ve spent years watching teams manage people, schedules, inventory, and sensitive data through a mix of Word, Excel, email, and shared drives. Most of this work is deterministic and repeatable, but it’s still done manually or with fragile, one‑off automations.\n\nOver the past year, I’ve been exploring an open‑source, offline‑first collaboration tool aimed at production workflows. I’ve focused mostly on problem definition and architecture, with some small proofs of concept, but nothing close to something I’d ask others to use yet.\n\nMy questions are about **process and feasibility**:\n\n* How do maintainers bootstrap contributors when the domain is niche?\n* What level of implementation or polish is usually expected before asking for help, and is it common for contributors to engage at the architecture/design stage?\n* Is it realistic to expect organic contributors for a project like this, or do projects in this space typically start with paid development and open up later?\n\nI’m comfortable continuing to work on this as a long‑term learning and design exercise, but I want to be realistic about expectations and respectful of open‑source norms.\n\nIf it helps, here’s a repo I built with an early architecture draft:  \n[https://github.com/wlococode/openprod](https://github.com/wlococode/openprod)\n\nI'm happy to share additional details and POC code if useful.

The kicker is when they mention that they **need** the feature for work, but also couldn't possibly pay for it or buy me a pizza gift card. \n\nAnd if you have a more positive user experience than that (not all projects I've been involved in have been awful), consider that a happy bonus.",

Don't expect this at all.\n\n> What level of implementation or polish is usually expected before asking for help, and is it common for contributors to engage at the architecture/design stage?\n\nYou can ask for help from anyone, and usually there will be someone willing to give an answer in an appropriate place. Usually what people expect is that you have genuinely tried to invest \"equal\" time into solving the question and composing a good question, that they would invest in answering it in a thoughtful way. Other than that, you can be as stupid as you like, because everyone starts from zero.\n\n> Is it realistic to expect organic contributors for a project like this, or do projects in this space typically start with paid development and open up later?\n\nlol what, no, projects like this would normally start with a completely unpaid developer working in their hobby time.\n\nIf the domain is niche and underserved enough, often you could go straight to a paid/commercial model, if you were that kind of person.\n\nNote that you are going to get far less help if it looks like AI is doing everything for you. Because then people will just expect that the AI can continue helping you, if that's what you're using, rather than investing their own time. People in general don't want to be an extra lacky for AI driven development.",

Here's how much I contributed: [https://github.com/dart-lang/tools/commits?author=chenzhiguang](https://github.com/dart-lang/tools/commits?author=chenzhiguang)), \n\nThere were three main reasons: first, my product relies on this library and this library is from official, second, I saw it as a chance to build my reputation, third, it was a good opportunity to solidify my coding practices and receive feedback I might not get elsewhere.\n\nPerhaps I'm considering personal gain too much, but I think you have to give them clear reason, especially if you're relying on them.",
