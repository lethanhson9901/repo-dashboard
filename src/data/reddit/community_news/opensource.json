      "text": "I've been following the AI slop problem closely and it seems like it's getting worse, not better.\n\n**The situation:**\n\n* Daniel Stenberg (curl) said the project is \"effectively being DDoSed\" by AI-generated bug reports. About 20% of submissions in 2025 were AI slop. At one point, volume spiked to 8x the usual rate. He's now considering whether to shut down their bug bounty program entirely.\n* OCaml maintainers rejected a 13,000-line AI-generated PR. Their reasoning: reviewing AI code is *more* taxing than human code, and mass low-effort PRs \"create a real risk of bringing the Pull-Request system to a halt.\"\n* Anthony Fu (Vue ecosystem) and others have posted about being flooded with PRs from people who feed \"help wanted\" issues directly to AI agents, then loop through review comments like drones without understanding the code.\n* GitHub is making this worse by integrating Copilot into issue/PR creation — and you can't block it or even tell which submissions came from Copilot.\n\n**The pattern:**\n\nPeople (often students padding resumes, or bounty hunters) use AI to mass-generate PRs and bug reports. The output looks plausible at first glance but falls apart under review. Maintainers — mostly unpaid volunteers — waste hours triaging garbage.\n\nSome are comparing this to Hacktoberfest 2020 (\"Shitoberfest\"), except now it's year-round and the barrier is even lower.\n\n**What I'm wondering:**\n\nIs anyone building tools to help with this? Not \"AI detection\" (that's a losing game), but something like:\n\n* Automated triage that checks if a PR actually runs, addresses the issue, or references nonexistent functions\n* Cross-project contributor reputation — so maintainers can see \"this person has mass-submitted 47 PRs across 30 repos with a 3% merge rate\" vs \"12 merged PRs, avg 1.5 review cycles\"\n* Better signals than just \"number of contributions\"\n\nThe data for reputation is already in the GitHub API (PR outcomes, review cycles, etc). Seems like someone should be building this.\n\n**For maintainers here:** What would actually help you? What signals do you look at when triaging a PR from an unknown contributor?",

Until SourceForge realised that they can start (ab)use their near monopoly status as a centralised software forge for making more money. Enshitification ensued and new forges cropped up everywhere. \n\nGitHub managed to hold out fairly long without a significant enshitification. Until  Microsoft acquisition that is. For a while after that, the MS ownership was mostly a net positive, as it allowed GitHub to pour money into features that were in sore need of more cash injection.\n\nBut now we all see how all that investment begs for a return… we now see more and more “features” that are basically “trialware” in disguise. On the face of it, it’s fine. They need to earn somehow the money that they spend on keeping the service running. But then there are moves that are outright predatory. Like using repos hosted in their forge to train LLMs, asking to pay for running your own actions runners, etc. \n\nGitLab has a seemingly good name because it’s an alternative to GitHub, but they too have become “The Alternative GitHub”.\n\nWhile you can self-host GitLab, quite a few features are for paying customers only. They are much more transparent about their open source vs commercial features, but that Open Core model has its own issues.\n\nAnd the most important issue is that with GitLab you are again are dependent on a single software/service provider. And that means as soon as investors feel they need a newer and more luxurious yacht, they will find a way to tighten screws on the “freeloaders”.\n\nWith federated platforms like Tangled, the trick is that at least in theory, you could host your own Knot (node/service in Tangled parlance). Yes, at the moment, there is just one implementation of a Knot. But because the protocol is open, there could be more. In fact, all or some of the open source forges could add support for Tangled protocol to their code base and we could easily have a network of self hosted repositories, where it would be so much more difficult for any single player to poison the well.",

I think you could achieve similar by either moving to Mercurial or just ditching the Github-like UI that encourages people to look at coding like social media numbers for engagement.  Judicious friction here goes a long way, because vibe coders don't really care about the projects they make PRs for, they just want to implement low hanging fruit.",

My experience is not quite the same as yours. I was lucky enough to go back to university at a later stage of my life. I already had 15 years of working experience behind me and I knew exactly what kind of job I didn't want anymore when I decided to study CS. Admittedly, I already was a nerd but I've never done anything close to coding.\n\nWhen I started uni, my goal was clear : I was there to learn a job and not get a diploma. My reasoning being if I know what I'm doing, the diploma will be easy. And it was. For me. Not for my fellow colleagues 10 or 15 years younger, who wanted to get a diploma but also ladies and beers. \n\nI already had that and more. I enjoyed my youth, then worked shitty jobs then got lucky to be able to go back to studying. They, on the other hand, had to do it all at the same time. And this is difficult. \n\nMy point is: usually, uni is not *that* hard. It is not easy but it is (at least at the bsc level) not (yet) rocket science. What is hard is being able to transition from school to university (this is very hard), get a diploma **and** enjoy your life as a young handsome dude.tte.",

The 10% who do, maybe worth taking a second look in case you were wrong. Revert to first option if still feeling like your brain got lidocaine.\n\nFor a less confrontational version, at the first whiff of it, stop reading and respond to the PR with, “interesting, can you explain x? Not quite getting what those lines are supposed to do” or something else that shifts the burden of making sense of it to the “author” and shove it to the bottom of the stack. Again, 90% won’t respond and you can close it for inactivity.\n\nEventually you build a muscle memory for recognizing the slop, and that makes it easier both to recognize and dismiss it.

Ultimately, the software's architecture and overarching logic remain defined by humans. I consider the latter approach tolerable as code completion rather than pure AI generation.

I'm very upfront about what my priorities are and what I'm planning on working on; my issue backlog is quite large. I regularly mix user requests and feedback with the stuff that I want to work on, and the project is much better for it.\n\nOn the other, some people can certainly be trying. I've  (thankfully) never had somebody pitch a fit because I wouldn't work on their pet feature immediately. The most common and frustrating interaction I get is when I get bug reports without enough information and the reporter doesn't work with me to diagnose what's going on. At that point, you just have to put up your hands and do something else.\n\nSo yeah. If you are able to interpret requests as excitement rather than as demands, that can make a big difference.",

But the one and only complaint about it over the last several years is that it was slow compared to other proprietary software, and it was very slow...\n\n\nWell, that's definitely not the case anymore. I was able to scan a mid range Samsung 870 EVO 4TB SSD with 1.2% empty space (98.8% full!) in less than two seconds. Then, in under 10 seconds, it scanned 16.1TB of data from a SMB network share on a ZFS array over a 2.5Gb connection.\n\n\nThis is a tremendous improvement over a few years ago when I last updated the app, and the performance over a network share is simply amazing....\n\n\nI'm not affiliated with the project at all, and I can't say when exactly this performance improvement happened. I haven't heard of, and cant really find any news of this update, so please don't flame me for being old news. Just trying to inform folks! :D\n\n\nAlso, this is a Windows application only. On my linux machines specifically use NCDU.\n\n\nhttps://windirstat.net/\n\nhttps://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu",

      "text": "Hi,\n\nAround two months ago, I submitted a Feature Request and a PR to a repository that had a GPL-3.0 license. The PR was rejected because it conflicted with a feature of another project of the author. He explicitly marked the FR as \"not planned\". I’ve told him that I’ll continue with this change in a fork. He wasn’t objecting to that. After that, during a period of roughly two months, I added a couple of unique features and was frequently merging upstream into my fork (merging also became more difficult with time). And because I put quite a lot of effort into the fork, also complying with the GPL-3.0 license, I started to think about making a public release. I’ve reached out to the author to see what he was thinking about it. I’ve tried to be friendly, but the farther the discussion went, the stranger his behavior became. At first, he said that he had stabilized his features, and now we can work together on merging my fork. I asked him to give me a day or two to think about it because I’ve put a lot of effort into the fork, and still prefer to publish. Then he told that he will change his license from GPL-3.0 (which gives permission to publish) to one that requires explicit permission from the author. I agreed and said that I will respect it and won’t merge the upstream repo into mine. And he did update the license, and I’ve merged till the latest GPL-3.0 commit, updated the readme, and renamed my repository.\n\nBut quickly he changed his mind and started objecting to me making the public release, also saying that he will implement all features that I have in his repo, and put all efforts to prevent my fork from going public.\n\nI can relate to his feelings partially, but he chose GPL-3.0 in the first place. Before even submitting the first PR, I’ve carefully considered the license terms, because I knew that if I made a PR and the author decide to reject it, then I can continue working on the fork and even publish it later. And with this assumption in mind, I implemented several features in the fork and fixed a couple of bugs. I wouldn’t make a single modification to the source repo if not GPL-3.0.  \n  \nWhat would you suggest? How is it usually handled? I’m a single developer and don’t want to deal with legal staff (though I always followed the license terms and tried to be respectful to the original repository's efforts, never claiming credit for what was implemented there).",

Though, I don't like how he deal with stuff. There was an interest from other folks as well in contributing, but doesn't seem like he wants any BIG contributions.

      "text": "Recently, a comment from one of the Obsidian team members in the Discord OMG server confirmed that its plugin publishing rules won't adhere to open-source licensing models. It means even if a plugin is developed using a license that grants publishing rights (like GPL-3.0), Obsidian won't accept any forked versions until some conditions are met. For example, an explicit permission from the author is required if the upstream plugin is in active development (GPL-3.0 grants rights to publish without requiring an explicit permission). The [developer policy](https://docs.obsidian.md/Developer+policies) on their website is not yet updated and still uses open-source licensing terms, and it doesn’t explicitly states whether a fork is allowed to publish or not. Quote: \"Include a LICENSE file and clearly indicate the license of your plugin or theme.\"\n\nNotably, seems like even Apple's App Store allows publishing if the forked app follows the license. Is such a change acceptable from the open source perspective? What are your thoughts?\n\n[Source](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/840286264964022302/1455281698345324687)\n\nDisclaimer: The OP is not affiliated with the Obsidian team in any way.",

It smells of **arbitrary decision** which I am triggered by more than other ppl.\n\nOther questions:\n\n1. Does Obsidian pass any of its revenue to the plugin makers?  Could there be a quiet assurance to those that they will not allow forks.\n\n2. Do Obsidian Inc ever kick plugins from being listed for reasons of viability?  Sure they can kick because they belatedly discover the plugin is stealthy-malware that's otherwise convincing as a plugin - and [forks are statistically more likely to be those than originals](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/auto-draft-275/). \n\nOn that last - in package-land generally (Npm, maven-central, apt, brew, etc etc) - I think the repo maintainers are going to have to pivot to owning the compilation-and-package step even if don't provide test-automation capability.  That would also include plugin-registries like Obsidian's (but also Chrome's extensions and alike).",

Simple and easy to integrate, but may produce minor color artifacts.\n- PR [#177](https://github.com/Ryan-Millard/Img2Num/pull/177): Uses CIELAB color space for perceptual accuracy. Produces better visual results but is more complex and potentially slower.\n\nAs a maintainer, I want to ensure we end up with a single, high-quality implementation and make that decision as fairly and kindly as possible. I’ve created a GitHub discussion to encourage the contributors to collaborate and combine the best aspects of both PRs, rather than competing against each other: https://github.com/Ryan-Millard/Img2Num/discussions/184\n\nBefore moving forward, I wanted to ask:\n- How do you usually handle situations where multiple contributors submit different implementations of the same feature? I feel like this will be a very tough and possibly opinionated answer.\n- Do you prefer picking one, combining ideas, or encouraging collaboration like I’m attempting to do?\n- Any tips for keeping the process positive and transparent for all contributors? OSS is for everyone, so what I want isn't the important thing in my eyes - I want to get a final product that will benefit everyone.\n\nThank you for making it this far! I trust this sub - you guys always give great answers.\n\nEdit: We came to a conclusion in the discussion (see the link above) and are now implementing the fix. Thank you all for the wonderful advice!",

      "text": "Like many of you, I've struggled with Instagram's addictive feed. I used to rely on *DFInstagram* to block the endless scroll, but it hasn't been maintained for a long time and updating it to newer Instagram versions was a pain.\n\nSo I decided to build my own solution: **FeurStagram** \\- an open-source project that removes Instagram's addictive features while keeping the essentials (for Android).\n\nThe FeurStagram repo is on Github : [https://github.com/jean-voila/FeurStagram](https://github.com/jean-voila/FeurStagram)\n\n# Two ways to use it:\n\n* **Ready-to-install APK :** Just grab the latest patched APK from the GitHub releases and install it. No technical skills needed! DIY Patching Toolkit. You can install the apk file from here : [feurstagram-410-1-0-63-71.apk](https://github.com/jean-voila/FeurStagram/releases/download/v410-1-0-63-71/feurstagram-410-1-0-63-71.apk)\n* You can also patch any Instagram version yourself using the included scripts\n\n# What gets blocked:\n\n* ❌ Feed posts (blocked at network level)\n* ❌ Explore tab (redirects to DMs)\n* ❌ Reels tab (redirects to DMs)\n\n# What still works:\n\n* ✅ Stories\n* ✅ Direct Messages\n* ✅ Profile\n* ✅ Reels shared in DMs (so you can still view what friends send you, but can't scroll)\n* ✅ Search\n* ✅ Notifications Why this approach? Unlike DFInstagram which stopped being updated:\n\n**Pre-built APKs available** \\- just download and install from releases\n\n**DIY option -** if you want a specific Instagram version, you can patch it yourself\n\n**Future-proof -** when Instagram updates, I'll release the new patched version (or you can patch it yourself)\n\n**I**t's open source, you can see exactly what it does. no shady modifications, just blocks unwanted content\n\n# The toolkit uses two patching strategies:\n\n* **Network-level blocking -** intercepts Instagram's API calls and blocks feed content at the source\n* **Tab redirection -** when you tap Explore or Reels, it opens DMs instead The result: Instagram becomes purely a communication tool. You can still message friends, view their stories, check notifications, and use your profile. But no more doomscrolling through the feed, no explore rabbit holes, no endless reels.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts and feedback.\n\n",

No accounts, no database, and no persistent logs. Once the room is empty, it's gone.\n\n**The Tech Stack:**\n\n* **Backend:** Rust (Axum + Tokio) for the signaling server. It’s super lightweight—handling thousands of concurrent rooms with minimal resource usage.\n* **Frontend:** Svelte 5 + Tailwind for the UI.\n* **WebRTC:** Pure P2P mesh for audio (data doesn't touch my server, only signaling does).\n\n**Why I built this:** I wanted a truly private and friction-free way to hop on a voice call without signing up for Discord or generating a Zoom meeting link. I also wanted to learn Rust and deep dive into WebRTC.\n\n**For Developers:** I’ve published the core logic as SDKs if you want to add voice chat to your own apps:\n\n    @treyorr/voca-client (Core SDK)\n    \n    @treyorr/voca-react\n    \n    @treyorr/voca-svelte\n\n**Self-Hosting:** Ideally, you can just use [voca.vc](https://voca.vc/) for free, but it's also designed to be self-hosted easily. The docker image is small and needs no external dependencies like Redis or Postgres. [Self-hosting docs here](https://voca.vc/docs/self-hosting).\n\n**Feedback:** This is my first \"real\" open-source release, so I’d love you to roast my code or give feedback on the architecture!\n\n* **Repo:** [github.com/treyorr/voca](https://github.com/treyorr/voca)\n* **Demo:** [voca.vc](https://voca.vc/)\n* **Docs:** [voca.vc/docs](https://voca.vc/docs)\n\nThanks!",

Things like documentation fixes, small UI tweaks, or test coverage are usually very welcome and help you learn the contribution flow fast. For MERN and React Native, B2C style apps with visible UX tend to be easier to reason about than deep infra. I would also skim the issue tracker first and see how maintainers respond, that matters more than star count. If maintainers are closing issues and giving feedback, it is usually a good sign the project is worth your time.",

I'd like to start by apologising for how some people here have responded to this post (they think this subreddit is dedicated only to them, which makes them angry when they see people with similar problems post about their problems). It isn't very nice, and it makes getting help very challenging. \n\nHere are my recommendations:\n1. Follow this subreddit - a lot of people post their projects here, and you may find one that excites you.\n2. Follow subreddits and other similar social media groups that post about things you're interested in.\n3. Ask this question elsewhere and maybe here again in a month or two if you don't find somewhere that you'd like to contribute.\n4. Consider any packages you currently use and see if there are any issues that seem doable on their repository.\n\nIt isn't easy to find someone else's project to work on because that requires advertising on their part, which can be tough.\n\nIf you're interested, I have an OSS project ([Img2Num](https://github.com/Ryan-Millard/Img2Num/)) that is relatively new (no releases yet) and open to beginners and new contributors who would like to shape the repository. It uses C++ compiled to WebAssembly (so we have no backend) to convert any image into a color-by-number template that allows users to color their image directly in their browser.\n\nDon't lose hope! You will find the perfect project soon. Happy New Year!🥳✨️",

That's an exhausting framing, especially if you build products for other people as a job, too.\n\nMy advice is to take the \"gift culture\" framing of OSS; don't start open-source projects to _get_ anything, start them to solve a problem _you have_, and gift that solution to the community. If you notice someone having a problem your project solves, mention that they're welcome to use and build on your solution.\n\nIf a handful of people are helped, even if they just learn something from reading your code, you've done a great thing. If _no one_ is helped, you still built a tool that's valuable for you. \n\nWhen _lots_ of people find something useful, you'll find very quickly that running a popular project is a very stressful and busy job for which you very rarely get paid. Unless that sounds fun to you, don't worry so much about getting attention ;-)",

But with a random post or by chatting in my community, I've found out that there's a fanbase for that... Then I evolve it into a bit polished product and try to satisfy my own needs of the app which was the initial idea while adding feature requests and solving bugs in the mean-time. I'll give some examples,\n\n* My current trending project is \"Essentials\" which is actually me being bored and turning all my Tasker (A powerful android automation tool) projects into a single Android app just because I learned native app development and also I always like to have my own things... And pretty much every project I do, I push to github, and if there's at least one guy who says like to use it , I publish releases as well... And the community grew one by one for few weeks and just on time on 1st of January, my app got featured by a YT channel out of the blue and now I am at almost 500 stars in 1 month.\n* Another trending app \"AirSync\" ... basically I made it because KDE connect sucks on Apple Silicon and I have no plans of switching away from Android or macOS. Wanted to have cool features with the mac like how iPhones do and dove deep into this topic and made myself an app 2 months early to starting my swift module at university to start learning early. And since I learned Android native development as well, wanted to do everything 100% native, no cross platform BS. This was my 1st swift app I wrote to learn... And posted in a subreddit to showcase liquid glass and boom it blew up...\n* All my zen browser modifications.... I like customizing anything.... Since Zen Browser is basically firefox which allows us to modify the UI as we like, I discovered how easy and gorgeous the transparency on web looks like and sure did many other people... My personal themes became another growing open source project...\n\nThere's quite more... I do have a little community but pretty much everyone there are completely random and from all around the world who joined to follow one project of mine and now they help me with app ideas, implementations, what they like, and all that. This keeps me inspired to continue to do more because beside 1 project, all others are completely free and all are open source...",

              "text": "No disrespect to OP, but IMO, an app like invoicing makes no sense as desktop app. Small businesses expands, you might eventually need to share invoice data with customers or accountants, send email, handle electronic payment processing, etc. Desktop applications also makes it more difficult to do backup, etc because you basically have to leave it all to the user to do it themselves. And you might need to access the data from multiple devices or on the field from your mobile. The limitations of desktop-only applications seems like it'll fit only a very, very tiny niche.\n\n\nIMO, if I were to design this app, I'd have structured it as an open source, self-hosted solution. Users should be able to signup to an AWS account, and then go to the Marketplace and subscribe to a cloud formation template that'll deploy a small self hosted instance of the application. If you want to avoid requiring authentication, it'd make sense to create a thin mobile app so they don't need to keep authenticating with every transaction.\n\n\nOr they can run a localised instance in a Dockerised instance on their local machine. Make it more like a desktop app, but with a pathway to cloud deployment when they grow. ",

Arguing there is no patent license makes as much sense than arguing there is no copyright license.\n\n> discouraging patent trolling\n\nThis is true, to some extent, due to the copyright retaliation clause (but only if the author of the program has some patents on it and the potential troll wishes to use that program).\n\n> while \"inbound=outbound\" is a common expectation, Apache makes this explicit\n\nNeedless. Popular platforms like GitHub have the inbound=outboud policy in their terms of service.

Ackee only tracks total time spent overall.

I'm a dotnet and VueJS/NuxtJS dev, so I build all landing pages/blog sites/marketing sites/doc sites in the Vue ecosystem, either using VitePress (VueJS static site generator, 10/10) which is mainly for technical docs or Nuxt.\n\nThis weekend, I just released a small CLI tool for helping make videos with Da Vinci Resolve, it's called resolver. Repo is open source on GitHub, and I wanted a nice docsite for it instead of just a README.md. The Nuxt ecosystem has a nice SSG for technical docs called [Docus](https://docus.dev), very easy to use. I just made a \\`/docs/\\` in my root dir and source it all from a monorepo. I'm a solopreneur and regularly host crap in Azure, so I just made a free tier Azure static web app and host the docsite up in Azure. Deploy from my \\`production\\` branch using a GitHub Actions CICD script. Feel free to look at my repo and see how I connected it all.\n\nFor my docsite, I already own [https://solopreneur.sh](https://solopreneur.sh) to market myself and my startups, so I just added the docs for this on a subdomain for it. I made a CNAME record with Namecheap and saved it to the Azure static web app, pretty standard stuff.\n\nYou've got several options for doc hosting like Azure, Vercel, Cloudfare, Netlify, and so on. Just choose something that's free and make sure you don't wake up to some $20K bill. In which case, scratch Netlify off the list.\n\n* GitHub repo: [https://github.com/DMiradakis/resolver](https://github.com/DMiradakis/resolver)\n* Docsite: [https://resolver.solopreneur.sh/](https://resolver.solopreneur.sh/)",

I’m curious how you personally discover open-source projects that are actually useful or interesting.\n\nI’m not from a technical background, but lately I’ve been exploring a lot of open source especially tools that help non-experts improve productivity or are simply fun to play with. I also share discoveries with a small group of friends in a similar situation.\n\nWould love to learn your discovery workflow:\n\n* Are you mostly task-driven? How do you search?\n* Any newsletters / weekly digests / top-repo lists / related repos / communities you follow consistently?\n* Any creators / maintainers / accounts that regularly share great open-source projects?\n* What is your personal stack? \n\nAlso feel free to share your own project if it’s interesting enough and non-expert friendly lol.\n\nThanks in advance!

We have tickets opened for Microsoft that haven't been closed for years. Windows experience basically sucks now. Every new update is aimed to fix some issues from previous versions, while introducing new ones. Adobe is charging you now cancellation fees too? You no longer \"own\" games you bought with your money? Buying is not owning?\n\nThe same can be said about open-source too although I have seen open-source is quite quick in fixing issues. If they don't, you can just fork it, fix it on your own and continue using it. You can even pay/donate developers a coffee amount, ask them to fix it on priority and they'll fix it for you in less amount of time.\n\nI get it that there are other factors at play here like in my domain, open-source alternatives are mostly cli based which users find difficult to use rather than gui based programs that proprietary ones offer. If open-source offers something good, it mostly has unpleasant UI or worse onboarding experience. It often focuses on niche things only rather than full package that closed ones offer. If we set apart this issues for a while, is blame-game the only thing that makes proprietary always win over open-source?\n",

It's usually preferable to just switch to something that's maintained.\n\n\nPoor quality of support or lack of support contract can be tolerable in some cases. If the software is popular and well maintained, you can have reasonable confidence that major issues will be addressed even if the developer doesn't really listen directly to you or no contract is available.

I can just say, \"Well, it's Microsoft, so it's the biggest name in the business.\"  \nBut if I choose a really good solution for their exact use case, Nextcloud, Seafile, Syncthing, or even closed Tresorit, even if it is better than OneDrive in every way, any problem is now my fault for NOT recommending Microsoft.\n\nThe entire corporate world is based on an endless, twisted tapestries of lies, deceit and shady deals. Almost nothing is ever based on what is actually a good product.",

Fully local. Simulated tasks can loop, trigger at startup, or be launched via a desktop shortcut.\n\nMicrosoft Store: [https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xp9cjlhwvxs49p](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xp9cjlhwvxs49p)    \nSource code and issues: [https://github.com/AmirHammouteneEI/ScheduledPasteAndKeys](https://github.com/AmirHammouteneEI/ScheduledPasteAndKeys)   \nPortable (v1.6) : [https://files.amirhammoutene.dev/Tasket++/1.6/Tasket++\\_v1.6.zip](https://files.amirhammoutene.dev/Tasket++/1.6/Tasket++_v1.6.zip)\n\nI’m not asking for a full QA process — a short impression or concise feedback will be greatly appreciated.

It is good for services you might not want to keep an account for, or for things tat you KNOW will try and spy on you but you have no choice. \n\nThe reason you wouldn't do what we have in the past with a 'professional' inbox and a 'catch all' inbox comes down to fingerprinting and account access. With enough time I can match your personal box and your spam box together and it would take just a bit of effort. This is called fingerprinting. Also, account access for an account that is left open for a service can create an issue where the attacker can gain access to the actual email, depending on how you do things like passwords and such. Further, most people create their spam email with their main email as a backup. This is just a nice little back door for an attacker because you likely got lazy and forgot about it. (which no shame, I didn't realize it myself at one point)\n\nAs for blocked domains, this is a Bring Your Own Domain bit of kit. So a blocked domain depends on YOU not OPs domains.",

Strange that this discussion would be censored on r/arduino, but oh well. \n\nAlso, I'm sure courts in your country would have something to say about \"adhesion contracts\" - where customers with no bargaining power are made to sign terms because they have no other choice, i.e., a take-it-or-leave-it approach. This phrase is fairly universal, so it can be a good starting point to understand how your country might deal with this situation. \n\nArduino's updated terms are exactly that, and they also go a step further by presuming acceptance on part of the users by their usage of the Platform. While this has become somewhat standard, it can still be used to argue that the terms of a contract are unfair. \n\nCourts will generally have the power to intervene in such contracts, even if the language used may be different. On the other hand, the fair use defence can look vastly different in each country, so that really comes down to whether your country has encapsulated the doctrine in legislation. \n\nDo let me know if you dive deeper into this, it sounds fascinating.

I just wanted to share my first \"officially released\" opensource project.\n\nMy motivation for building this project in the first place was to fix the annoying problem with Electron apps' audio streams within pavucontrol or other audio control apps. All electron apps would always show up as \"Chromium\" with the chromium icon despite all being different apps. Another issue was that WirePlumber also couldn't differentiate the different electron apps, and always resets all electron apps to the same volume setting. If you ever found these issues also annoying, this project might be for you!\n\nIf it isn't already obvious enough, this app is for Linux only (and really, only Linux has any use for this app). It's currently only tested for Arch Linux (and is also on the AUR), so if you are interested, I would really appreciate if you could test out on your machines and distros as well!\n\nPlease check out the repos for more info.\n\nCodeberg: [https://codeberg.org/ponleou/pipetron](https://codeberg.org/ponleou/pipetron)  \nGitHub (mirror): [https://github.com/ponleou/pipetron](https://github.com/ponleou/pipetron)",

GraphQLite is an SQLite extension that brings graph database functionality to SQLite using the Cypher query language.\n\nThe idea came from wanting graph queries without the operational overhead of running Neo4j for smaller projects. Sometimes you just want to model relationships and traverse them without spinning up a separate database server. SQLite already gives you a single-file, zero-config database—GraphQLite adds Cypher's expressive pattern matching on top.\n\nYou can create nodes and relationships, run traversals, and execute graph algorithms like PageRank, community detection, and shortest paths. It handles graphs with hundreds of thousands of nodes comfortably, with sub-millisecond traversal times. There are bindings for Python and Rust, or you can use it directly from SQL.\n\nI hope some of y'all find it useful.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/colliery-io/graphqlite](https://github.com/colliery-io/graphqlite)",
