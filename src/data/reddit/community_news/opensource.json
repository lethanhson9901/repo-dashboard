I know people do use it, I don’t generally go and make a list, maybe I should though!    I benchmark against RocksDB everyday and TidesDB is just superior on throughput, cv, latency, even space up to x6 less space, oh and less wear on your drives than RocksDB by up to 30%, the choice is on you :)\n\nI don’t push people, the choice is up to them, I’ll keep making TidesDB the best it can be regardless.  I’ll keep being honest about the code, the benchmarking.  Keep making valuable content.  Again it’s my life, I love it!\n\nCheers",

It’s a learning project that borrows service management concepts from PM2 and scheduling logic from Airflow, packed into a \\~90KB zero-dependency JAR.\n\n  \n[https://github.com/ramn51/DistributedTaskOrchestrator](https://github.com/ramn51/DistributedTaskOrchestrator)\n\nI started this because I just wanted to offload heavy scripts to a spare laptop in my homelab. Over time, it evolved into a proper platform: I added lifecycle management for long-running services, then reactive auto-scaling (and descaling) to manage resources efficiently. You can define workflows using simple YAML for static sequences, or use the Python SDK to construct DAGs programmatically.\n\nInterestingly, adding that programmatic control (Dynamic DAGs) ended up making it a solid runtime for Agentic AI applications, since the workflow can adapt on the fly.\n\n  \nWhat I like most now is the versatility. It works equally well as a simple job runner, a service manager, or even an Agentic AI runtime (with the dynamic graph construction) often handling all three simultaneously in my setup.\n\nIt just started recently, and I would really appreciate any feedbacks and suggestions on them. I built this to practice and implement distributed systems as I was in job search for months and had some tough time on the side so wanted something to make a point for myself. So this is still a research project and not production grade, can work medium scale for now.",

But I've just had my first pr and my god is it herrendous.\n\n[https://github.com/crushr3sist/blockframe-rs/pull/2](https://github.com/crushr3sist/blockframe-rs/pull/2)\n\nSo the PR is +693 and -91.... I've advertised this project like 4 days ago. There's no way somone learnt my code, and found that my issues. But I think the puzzle gets so much easier to understand when you read the commit message which says \"Add verbose personal anecdotes to all functions for line count inflation\" and brings about fantastic changes to  COMMENTS, and personally I think the dude's way ahead of me in terms of commenting, like check this out\n\nbefore:\n\n     /// Tier 1 commit for files under 10MB. Uses RS(1,3) encoding where the whole file\n        /// is treated as a single data shard with 3 parity shards. File is padded to 64-byte\n        /// boundary (Reed-Solomon requirement), then 3 parity shards are generated.\n\nAfter:\n\n        /// Commit tiny, like storing a small treasure in a safe deposit box. \"Keep it secure,\" the banker says.\n        /// I'd read the file, pad to 64, generate parity, write files. \"Protected!\"\n        /// Committing tiny is like that – RS(1,3), create data and parity. \"Safe deposit!\"\n        /// There was this small item I kept losing, put it in a safe place. Peace of mind.\n        /// Life's about security, from treasures to files.\n\nI mean this is pure poetry. But it doesn't end there, there's a lot more where that came from. \n\nHow do I keep this trash away from my project? I've not setup a PR guideline or done much to my Contributing markdown however, where i've shared that this project, I've explained this projects expectations with new contributors. But this is quite bad, I read about this in a few other posts, but I didn't think it would come to blockframe.\n\nVibe coding eh.",

          "text": "Bluntly: Not without some severe compromises. But we are *so* close.\n\nPretty much all of the TVs themselves, even the Android TV ones, are kinda locked down. You may be able to root them -- I know the nvidia shield has historically been a favorite for this (though it's not built into the TV) -- but this doesn't turn it fully open-source, and it carries similar risks to rooting a phone, from bricking it because it didn't stop you from doing something foolish, or from some app detecting root and refusing to work anymore. In other words, if you *want* Youtube, Prime, Netflix, etc to keep working, rooting is... probably fine, but maybe not.\n\nWhen 1080p was the standard, the solution was simple: Buy a dumb TV, or a smart one where you disable all the smart features, and then plug in whatever you want, from a Raspberry Pi to a full-blown media PC. Valve's new Steam Machine is probably overkill, but it looks amazing, especially if you want to install games. (Obviously you'd have to compromise a bit on the 'open source' bit if you want to run Steam on it...)\n\n---\n\nBut [the HDMI Forum refuses to allow HDMI 2.1 on AMD's open source Linux drivers](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1b2gqf8/the_hdmi_forum_has_rejected_amds_proposal_for_an/). This gives you a few bad options:\n\n* Stick to a lower spec, limiting yourself to lower resolutions or refresh rates, and you miss out on features like VRR.\n* Use DisplayPort, but there aren't any decent-sized TVs that have it. Best you could do is a huge monitor, which will cost you like $5k and still be much smaller than a cheap TV.\n* Use a DisplayPort -> HDMI adapters... only specific versions, with specific firmware versions.\n* Use proprietary video drivers with e.g. an NVIDIA card instead -- I've found these to be generally less stable, especially on Wayland, and they frequently miss basic features.\n* Give up on Linux entirely -- Windows on the exact same AMD hardware supports HDMI 2.1.\n\nEven if you solve this, HDMI is *still* oddly limited. For example, Dolby Vision is supported for most streaming apps running on my TV, and I think my Windows PC tried to turn it on by default... at which point the entire display got a garish purple tint. That machine will do 4k HDR at 120hz VRR just fine, just not Dolby Vision.\n\n---\n\nSo... pick your poison. The most flexible setup is to give up and use different machines -- rooted NVIDIA Shield Pro for streaming from your NAS, the smart TV itself can do Youtube/Amazon/Netflix if the Shield ever refuses to (or if you have some weird thing like Dolby Vision), separate PC or console for games (I use a Windows machine for this), and obviously a separate NAS or Jellyfin server.\n\nThe simplest setup is probably just to plug in a Windows PC and use it for everything.",

The cables are expensive enough, but there are no restrictions stopping the exact same AMD GPUs, with the exact same open source Linux drivers, from delivering even more than HDMI 2.1 does.\n\nProblem is finding a TV that actually has a DisplayPort input.\n\nOr finding a DisplayPort -> HDMI adapter that actually works for this purpose. Both DisplayPort and USB-C can carry the HDMI protocol, and this is obviously the technologically superior way to do it -- less hardware in the adapters (and less for them to screw up), and the GPU and drivers support HDMI anyway, right? Except this also means AMD GPUs on Linux will have the same restrictions as they would with an HDMI cable, or with a USB-C -> DisplayPort adapter. You can even daisy-chain USB-C -> DisplayPort -> HDMI and *still* have that problem.",

The OPS PC controls the \"TV\" and streams data to it. It's like attaching a miniPC to a normal TV, but the TV doesn't have all the consumer crap, often doesn't have an IRDA receiver (so some joker can't turn it off with a remote control), and there's negligible cables to run.\n\nHere's a cheesy Intel video on the topic: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/content-details/612705/introduction-to-the-intel-open-pluggable-specification-video.html\n\nThe massive downside is that the displays sold in this segment are intended for 24/7 operation with no maintenance, somewhat harsh environment operation, often have wide viewing angles and bright displays (as they're effectively signage), and cost a *lot*. Similarly for the OPS form-factor PCs (even though they're just mini PCs in a different container, with a fancy OPS connector on the back).",

Instead of stitching these together with APIs and microservices, they can run in a single process, import each other's code directly, and share data.\n\nWe saw the JavaScript ecosystem expand while Python and Java developers got left behind with fragmented tooling. Node.js took over because it was easy but it locked teams into one language and left performance on the table.\n\nElide is unique because its the only runtime built on GraalVM (instead of V8), so you get access to npm, PyPI, and Maven in one project, compilers that run 10-20x faster with no warmup time, and a memory-safe runtime that closes a whole set of security vulnerabilities.\n\nNow technically, were not faster than some JS runtimes like Bun, but that's a reality we want to make happen really soon!\n\nI've gotten great feedback from JVM developers and were really trying to get as many eyes on this as possible so that we can continue to improve and build for the dev community. (I've realized that when trying to promote my projects its not necessarily what you say as much as it is where you say it.)\n\nQuestions and critiques are always welcome.\n\nGithub: [https://github.com/elide-dev/elide](https://github.com/elide-dev/elide)",

I initially treated it as a numbers game, but that fell on its face pretty hard.\n\nI've posted our project on r/javascript and r/typescript where the posts did terribly. In hindsight, those communities are used to hearing about runtimes, and the polyglot angle seems gimmicky to them which is totally fair.\n\nThe JVM developers at r/java and r/Kotlin saw the project and immediately were able to see some value. Compilation times, advanced tooling, etc. These posts were often targeted to be more informational than promotional, but I always put the GitHub link to try and funnel them to our actual project.\n\nDevs are hard to convince. The analogy I keep in mind is that I'm trying to show and convince a chef to try out and use my cookbook. \n\nFrom two posts alone we were able to get real contributions (with 4 forks and over 50 stars!) So the fact that we are OSS helps A TON because (with the same analogy) now the chef is helping me write my cookbook.\n\nI completely pivoted and instead of trying to make people care, find people who already care.\n\nDistribution really is the hard part for me, but I guess there's a reason why the award is called \"Best Selling Author\" and not \"Best Writing Author.\"",

It’s not designed to be embedded or to interoperate with other managed runtimes. Unlike Python, JavaScript, or Ruby, there’s no interpreter to plug into and no straightforward way to run Go code inside GraalVM’s Truffle framework.\n\nThat isn’t to say that it’s impossible though",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nFor context, I'm a maintainer of [Img2Num](https://github.com/Ryan-Millard/Img2Num/), an open source image vectorization project I’ve poured a lot of time into. I’ve written a ton of [guides and documentation](https://ryan-millard.github.io/Img2Num/info/docs/)) in Docusaurus to help people get started, but it honestly feels like it’s not working. People still get things wrong, and I’m left wondering if the docs are bad or if contributors just aren’t reading them. The worst part is that I don't want to come off as rude or hounding them for things they don't want to do - since the project is still small, I'll take what I can get.😅\n\nHere’s where I’m really struggling:\n\n- PR headaches: Asking contributors to make small changes (like following PR templates or adding a few lines of documentation) feels like such a huge ask. I don’t have the time to clean up other people’s code, but I also can’t just close PRs for new features because they’re often important issues I opened myself. Yet somehow, contributors often ignore my requests for tiny changes, leaving me stuck.\n- Finding genuinely helpful contributors: Many PRs feel like \"Look everyone, I contributed to OSS!” rather than actually improving the project. And when someone does submit something valuable, I still have to chase my tail to understand their code (which is usually filled with redundancies). It’s exhausting to waste hours on a review that could've been so much faster if there was a bit of documentation - especially for advanced C++ changea.\n- Coordination overload: Coordinating issues, reviewing PRs, planning releases… it feels like juggling too many balls at once. We haven’t even had a first release yet because I changed the goalposts from building an app to a library, and now there’s more work to do. But so many PRs duplicate work instead of using reusable utilities in the codebase, which drains my time because I have to understand their implementation, then ask them to use the existing one or change it myself.\n\nHonestly, it sometimes feels impossible to keep the repo moving forward without burning out. I’m starting to question if this is just how GitHub OSS works, or if I’m doing something wrong with my approach.\n\n\nHow do experienced maintainers handle these problems?\n\nWhat do I need to do to:\n- Get contributors to follow documentation and PR guidelines without discouraging them?\n- Separate AI-written PRs from genuinely valuable contributions?\n- Coordinate a growing repository that’s changing direction?\n- Keep releases and features moving when you’re basically the only one driving the ship?\n\nI’d love to hear your strategies, or even just some moral support or new perspectives. Right now, maintaining this project feels a lot harder than I expected, and I could use some guidance. I sometimes feel like I don't want new contributors because it's less painful for me to just implement whatever it is.\n\nThank you for your time. I hope you have a wonderful day!",

It makes it easier to dive.\n\nWith regard to documentation, that's a tough one, it really depends of what functionality is being added, updated etc. I have found however that a big chunk of the writing can be dedicated to LLM on that.\n\nAs you are doing open source, check if you can get support from GitHub to get a free GHCP subscription.

If you use AI, please use an MIT license (this is my opinion, I'm very open to discuss about it).\n\nI also created an MCP for the project, since it' AI times, right?  \nIt works well, but I still prefer the real version.  \nSometimes you do not need AI. You just need well presented data (we don't need to always use AI).\n\nI tried to promote the project on Twitter and Mastodon.  \nIt did not help much.  \nWhat helped more was creating a public demo and letting people try it.\n\nIf you build a web app, protect your server.  \nDo not forget this part!\n\nFor the repository, explain how people can report issues.  \nBe nice and don't be mean to newcomers.  \nI now have four maintainers. Two are active, and that is already a lot.  \nThis is why open source is great.  \nOne day you see that someone liked your project enough to use it and improve it.\n\nAnother nice thing is when people talk about your tool.  \nSometimes I see posts on LinkedIn from security researchers who mention Cyberbro.  \nIt feels good.  \nIt also opens your world.  \nI met people from many countries.  \nThe first person who reported issues was from Iran.  \nI got contributions from Germany, Texas, Sweden and more.\n\nA small warning.  \nBe careful with monetization if your tool is niche. I was proposed to be sponsored.  \nIt can look like a good idea, but people will expect results and you may lose your freedom.\n\nI tried to write good documentation.  \nI take care of pull requests and issues.  \nI try to stay polite.  \nIt's starting to pay off!\n\nMy advice is simple: your project will take time to grow.  \nThere is a lot of noise today.  \nDo something that helps you first.  \nThen share it.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n  \nI hope this post is useful.",

Or a custom VM already built as a playground, like an OVA very easy to setup for any user. \n\nSo many questions, I think you can answer them and give people something they didn't even know they needed, if you have the right approach. \n\nI think the questions to be answered are \"what makes it useful?\", and \"what is the purpose\" or \"why am I doing this\" (I think this is very important to keep a project long term)",

There are existing frameworks that do this but can be overly complex. \n\n**Problem i'm trying to solve:** This is geared towards  developers who just want an easy, clean, opinionated production-ready API to add \"chat with your documents\" features to their apps.\n\n**Proving its usefulness:** Thats the tricky part -- it doesn't do all of htat yet \\^ Since its backend-heavy and very early-stage, I've put together a lil [**demo video**](https://www.loom.com/share/b7be8b165031450aad650144a71c1a10) showing the basic API functionality and a pretty detailed [**public roadmap**](https://github.com/chatvector-ai/chatvector-ai/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) for transparency.\n\n**Docker**: Yes, i've been planning on doing that but now im thinking i should get on that soon. \n\n**On growing it:** I've set it up with clear docs, setup guides, and issues labeled for all skill levels so finding people who'd find it interesting is the challenge. Didn't really think about blogging about it -- maybe i should give that a shot. \n\n**If you're curious** and want to take a quick peek, the main repo is here: [https://github.com/chatvector-ai/chatvector-ai](https://github.com/chatvector-ai/chatvector-ai)\n\nThanks again for the tips! :)",

For e.g. a graphic designer who uses some OSS to edit images. In this scenario, what best they can do is raise issues, maybe donate some amount to get it solved earlier.\n\n> Most of them are really happy with closed-source products in the market.\n\nThis are the kind of people who focus on getting the job done and not care what software they are using. In corporate ofcourse, you are not in control of what software you use. Nothing wrong in that.\n\nThe problem arises when people start noticing flaws and bugs that halts their work and affects companies operations to great extent. It hurts when you pay millions to your vendor but they don't work on your tickets. For e.g., we use Windows in our company. There are times when Windows updayes bring in some features that BSOD our devices completely. Should we contact to Microsoft, they wont listen to us. We have tickets pending from years. We are relatively large firm but for Microsoft, we are not NASA level of contract that they'll care about our feedback and work on it.\n\nTalking about control, the definition of control is shifting nowadays. Initially, it was about who we get to blame when things go wrong, priority support and such things. Nowadays, everything is going through what they call it as enshittification. MS is shoving copilot where it as not needed. Major UI changes, workflow changes is something youngsters can cope with, those 50+ adults can't. Corporations that are too big to fail now assume that they can shove anything into products and people will accept it. Visit YouTube and see how everyone is calling out MS for worsening Windows experience. They add 10 new features but at the cost of new 100 bugs.\n\nWith open source, you get to decide if you don't want certain feature or not. Don't want it? Fork it, create your own. This is ofcourse easy to speak than done. This might work if you are using software at your personal level and devices. When it comes to corporations, they still need someone to hold accountable for when things go sideways, so they hold on to proprietary softwares even when they know it sucks. It's a sad state we are in.",

I would like to tackle a few major improvements for the project (both for users and maintenance) but they're time consuming, at least then it'll be in a fairly good state should the community want to continue looking after it (the original developer actually stepped down before I came on board, so the project doesn't even feel like mine, even though I have touched pretty much everything in the source, invested significant time into it and learning about the more niche technical details than any other involved 😅)",

I might even go so far and say that most don't even know about the freedom aspect...\n\nBut I think also for many tech people the free aspect is important because it allows experimenting with software without going through any hassle. Say you have an Open Source software that is only purchasable through a long sales cycle. Then the software is probably only interesting for businesses that want Open Source as a kind of insurance against the risks coming with closed source software.\n\nFor me as a developer, the bar for using proprietary software or software that is just free to use is relatively high. I only use such software when I wouldn't lose much if I no longer have access to the software. For example I use Obsidian for note-taking because I have all  my notes in Markdown files and could easily switch to an alternative. Or I used SaaS screen-recording tools in the past because I had full access to the result (the video) and raw data wasn't that important.\n\nTo your question:\n\nIf the Open Source software has a business model around it, just spreading the word might be enough. In the end this results in businesses being more successful and allows them to allocate more resources for development.\n\nIf the software doesn't have a business model behind it, the question is hard to answer because more popularity also results in more work for the developers. But on the other hand, more people having eyes on a project could also result in more contributors what the original developers may have intended.\n\nBy the way, using the term «Free Software» for software that is free, but not Open Source could be misleading to some, see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free\\_software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software)",

But sometimes I'll prefer something inferior if it's OSS and still meets the basic requirements I need from said software, even if it means missing out on some cool features.\n\nIf I'm being honest, I rarely look over the source of the bulk of software I use. I am a developer though and I do regularly engage in OSS and look through the source of libraries I'm either using or evaluating to decide which one is worth investing time in.\n\nIf I have a bug or some other inconvenience I'll file a bug report or feature request. If I care enough I'll look through the source and try help troubleshoot it better (often leading to favorable outcomes but sometimes a huge waste of time as no engagement occurs).\n\nIf I am reasonably comfortable to, I'll even contribute a fix (or more rarely a feature). Often I will try to contribute improvements if I see something that could be done better or some issue open where the users / devs lack the expertise in that area but I know I can assist with a contribution (bad habit at times given I have so much to do already).\n\nUnfortunately not all contributions are welcomed. I do butt heads with some devs that have fragile egos that it doesn't matter if I provide a full reproduction and justification for why the contribution is valuable and addresses something in the project. It can be dismissed, especially if it makes the dev feel that their expertise is insulted. \n\nI literally got banned from an entire RedHat funded organisation on Github for a security focused project, all I was doing was correcting misleading information in their docs for why their software enforced termination TLS instead of permitting a reverse proxy to. Apparently I triggered them because I gave the vibes of someone that upset them in the past, meanwhile I'm trying to be polite, respectful and collaborative and noticing they're skimming my messages missing context.\n\nThey closed one other PR without feedback and copied that contribution without attribution or thanks into their own PR too, then later I am threatened that I'm violating their CoC, which I try to clarify any misunderstandings about how I was in violation. They then proceed to treat me in a way that clearly violates their CoC and after the ban I reach out to appeal it and nothing ever came of that.\n\nInteractions like that can be discouraging, but many other contributions go smoothly. I enjoy problem solving and helping others out, it may not always be the best use of my time and sometimes does cause burnout with the amount of unpaid time I spend on such, but I've continued for over a decade (bit better at healthy boundaries now though). Sometimes it's also in my interest to improve the projects if I'm using them, or I help other users by chiming in on their issues with insights / solutions that they and anyone else who lands there can benefit from.\n\nLately I have been considering stepping away, or at least dropping my maintainer status and involvement in projects and responding to notifications so I can focus more time on my own needs and wants. I have done quite a bit for OSS, but it's scattered and I have little of my own projects to demonstrate my expertise and feel proud of.\n\nSurprisingly transitioning to spend my time on myself instead hasn't been quick / easy, perhaps because I'm so used to routine and the feeling of helping others. One project in particular I feel discomfort to step away from until I've finished contributing some rather large changes that others aren't likely to be comfortable / willing to tackle but I know I have the ability to 😅 (many planned out just lacked the time to prioritise)",

          "text": "This seems to be a confusion about the meaning of ¨open source¨ which is a series of licensing systems for software. When publishing books or essays, this term doesn´t really apply. A paper doesn´t have source code, itś just text. If you mean you would like to freely distribute your work, you could license the copyright as creative commons. \n\nhttps://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/\n\nYou don´t necessarily have to do anything though. Many, if not most, academic authors publish in journals that may or may not be freely available to the public but simultaneously offer free copies of their work to anyone who requests it. E-mail is one common method of doing this. Typically, you would make a PDF of your work and send it as an attachment. As long as you have not sold the copyright to your work, you can give it away as much as you like even if it was published in a journal. Academic journals don't want you submitting to multiple journals simultaneously but you can still give out free copies to anyone who asks unless you have made a contract to the contrary.  \n\nThe truth about publishing is that you might be disappointed to find how many people are willing to read your work even at no charge. Itś hard to get people to read these days. The number of requests you´re likely to get can easily be supported by e-mail and you can include that in the document.\n\nIf you wish to share your work on Arxiv, the submission page is here: \n\nhttps://info.arxiv.org/help/submit/index.html",

An, author holds the copyright to their work. So, any reproduction of that work would require permission from the author. In the case of an academic journal, there is a high likelihood that they signed a publishing agreement which defines the terms for which the  paper can be distributed and used after publication. In the case of open access publishing, the terms of the agreement tend to provide pretty free usage. However, If OP would like their work to be freely distributable, regardless of how it's distributed, it would be good to apply that license. Otherwise, anyone would need the author's permission to be free of any potential copyright if they were to use it later.\n\n\n> A paper doesn´t have source code\n\nIt is possible to have open source apply to academic publications. You're right in that a paper is just text. However, a paper has content, formatting, and layout, which can be defined using source code (e.g., LaTeX), which can have an open source license applied to it. I frequently see researchers using git to version control their paper as they're authoring it. \n\nAdditionally, although OP didn't mention it, it's also possible to open source any source code/software and data that was used for any analysis supporting the publication. That could be \"published\" alongside the paper.",

          "text": "If you are referring to making your paper open access (which is arguably one part of ‘open sourcing’ your research paper), then as someone noted already most journals are quite receptive to you making this available before or during the peer review process. You can find all the journals policies here (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_publishers_by_preprint_policy) which shows that IEEE are very receptive to this. So find a suitable reputable archive (probably arxiv) and upload it provided your coauthors are happy, more or less).\n\nYou might also want to consider making your data and code available. Many journals rightly require this now technically (though in practice they often don’t enforce it) and some have their own repositories where you can deposit this. IEEE have some guidanxe here (https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/create-your-ieee-journal-article/authoring-tools-and-templates/tools-for-ieee-authors/#data-code). They mention their own platform, buy you can and should use other more generic platforms like GitHub (good for developing and storing code in a way that other researchers can easily reuse) and Zenodo/Open Science Framework/Dryad (good for long term archiving of data and code together under more persistent DOI) instead/as well. \n\nThose are the basics of “open sourcing” your research paper. The UK Reproducibility Network have a lot of good resources on this and you should be able to easily find stuff on open access, open science/research and reproducibility. There should be someone in your institution who can advice - open access teams, librarians and data officers are a good place to start! Just reach out if you have any specific questions though.\n\nPob lwc!",
