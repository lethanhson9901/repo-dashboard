      "text": "In most codebases I’ve worked on, the same pattern keeps repeating: someone adds a temporary workaround to ship something (“just for this release”, “we’ll clean it up later”), and then it quietly becomes permanent. After a few months, nobody remembers why it exists, but it’s now part of production.\n\nI built a small CLI called **DebtBomb** to experiment with a different approach: instead of vague TODOs, temporary code gets an explicit expiry date in a comment. When that date passes, the tool reports it — and optionally fails CI — until the code is either removed or the expiry is updated.\n\nExample:\n\n    // debtbomb: expires 2026-02-10 — remove after experiment A\n    \n\nThe tool just scans comments, so it’s language-agnostic. It runs as a single binary and can be dropped into any CI. There’s also an npm wrapper so it’s easy to try in JavaScript projects.\n\nIt’s something I built because I kept seeing “temporary” code live forever, and I wanted a lightweight way to make that visible and intentional.\n\nIf this sounds useful or if you have thoughts on how this could work better, the repo is here:  \n[https://github.com/jobin-404/debtbomb](https://github.com/jobin-404/debtbomb)\n\nHappy to hear ideas, criticism, or alternative approaches.",

Is it really forkable if the files to do that with are effectively behind a paywall? \n\nSomething that should be so easy like moving the holes in a flat object slightly takes so bafflingly long, and most of that time is spent turning a mesh file back into something that has holes at all.

Then at some later point the main developer/project owner went MIA resulting in the project getting forked (see Mbin). Mbin is still under active development but I and many others just lost interest, probably due to the lack of critical user mass.

Fossify Calendar *insists that you use US date formats* whatever your language or location.\n\nThere is also no good open source, modern email client. Thunderbird can't do threads properly and expects you to navigate your emails like it's 1999.\n\nTasks is actually a bit better; [Tasks.org](http://Tasks.org) and Planify are great, but let down in terms of FOSS by (usually) relying on Nextcloud and WebDAV.

Over time, it evolved into a proper platform: I added lifecycle management for long-running services, then reactive auto-scaling (and descaling) to manage resources efficiently. You can define workflows using simple YAML for static sequences, or use the Python SDK to construct DAGs programmatically.\n\nInterestingly, adding that programmatic control (Dynamic DAGs) ended up making it a solid runtime for Agentic AI applications, since the workflow can adapt on the fly.\n\n  \nWhat I like most now is the versatility. It works equally well as a simple job runner, a service manager, or even an Agentic AI runtime (with the dynamic graph construction) often handling all three simultaneously in my setup.\n\nIt just started recently, and I would really appreciate any feedbacks and suggestions on them. I built this to practice and implement distributed systems as I was in job search for months and had some tough time on the side so wanted something to make a point for myself. So this is still a research project and not production grade, can work medium scale for now.",

Aside from that I use the copilot agent mostly to aid with refactoring and unit tests.\n\nThe goal is to write a tiny C kernel able to spawn a shell in an emulated terminal.\n\nAlso I already have the basic building blocks to simulate the CPU at the hardware level, so that you could tell the runtime if you want to run in pure software emulation mode (i.e. as fast as possible), see the CPU pipeline doing its thing (the register bank communicating with the ALU, writing to memory through the ram bus, etc etc), or eventually see individual transistors going up and down (slow as fuck but coooool).\n\nAbout the name, \"cucaracha\" is cockroach in Spanish. I named it that way because here in Spain some of us call discrete ICs \"cucarachas\" for the way they look.",

But I've just had my first pr and my god is it herrendous.\n\n[https://github.com/crushr3sist/blockframe-rs/pull/2](https://github.com/crushr3sist/blockframe-rs/pull/2)\n\nSo the PR is +693 and -91.... I've advertised this project like 4 days ago. There's no way somone learnt my code, and found that my issues. But I think the puzzle gets so much easier to understand when you read the commit message which says \"Add verbose personal anecdotes to all functions for line count inflation\" and brings about fantastic changes to  COMMENTS, and personally I think the dude's way ahead of me in terms of commenting, like check this out\n\nbefore:\n\n     /// Tier 1 commit for files under 10MB. Uses RS(1,3) encoding where the whole file\n        /// is treated as a single data shard with 3 parity shards. File is padded to 64-byte\n        /// boundary (Reed-Solomon requirement), then 3 parity shards are generated.\n\nAfter:\n\n        /// Commit tiny, like storing a small treasure in a safe deposit box. \"Keep it secure,\" the banker says.\n        /// I'd read the file, pad to 64, generate parity, write files. \"Protected!\"\n        /// Committing tiny is like that – RS(1,3), create data and parity. \"Safe deposit!\"\n        /// There was this small item I kept losing, put it in a safe place. Peace of mind.\n        /// Life's about security, from treasures to files.\n\nI mean this is pure poetry. But it doesn't end there, there's a lot more where that came from. \n\nHow do I keep this trash away from my project? I've not setup a PR guideline or done much to my Contributing markdown however, where i've shared that this project, I've explained this projects expectations with new contributors. But this is quite bad, I read about this in a few other posts, but I didn't think it would come to blockframe.\n\nVibe coding eh.",

          "text": "Bluntly: Not without some severe compromises. But we are *so* close.\n\nPretty much all of the TVs themselves, even the Android TV ones, are kinda locked down. You may be able to root them -- I know the nvidia shield has historically been a favorite for this (though it's not built into the TV) -- but this doesn't turn it fully open-source, and it carries similar risks to rooting a phone, from bricking it because it didn't stop you from doing something foolish, or from some app detecting root and refusing to work anymore. In other words, if you *want* Youtube, Prime, Netflix, etc to keep working, rooting is... probably fine, but maybe not.\n\nWhen 1080p was the standard, the solution was simple: Buy a dumb TV, or a smart one where you disable all the smart features, and then plug in whatever you want, from a Raspberry Pi to a full-blown media PC. Valve's new Steam Machine is probably overkill, but it looks amazing, especially if you want to install games. (Obviously you'd have to compromise a bit on the 'open source' bit if you want to run Steam on it...)\n\n---\n\nBut [the HDMI Forum refuses to allow HDMI 2.1 on AMD's open source Linux drivers](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1b2gqf8/the_hdmi_forum_has_rejected_amds_proposal_for_an/). This gives you a few bad options:\n\n* Stick to a lower spec, limiting yourself to lower resolutions or refresh rates, and you miss out on features like VRR.\n* Use DisplayPort, but there aren't any decent-sized TVs that have it. Best you could do is a huge monitor, which will cost you like $5k and still be much smaller than a cheap TV.\n* Use a DisplayPort -> HDMI adapters... only specific versions, with specific firmware versions.\n* Use proprietary video drivers with e.g. an NVIDIA card instead -- I've found these to be generally less stable, especially on Wayland, and they frequently miss basic features.\n* Give up on Linux entirely -- Windows on the exact same AMD hardware supports HDMI 2.1.\n\nEven if you solve this, HDMI is *still* oddly limited. For example, Dolby Vision is supported for most streaming apps running on my TV, and I think my Windows PC tried to turn it on by default... at which point the entire display got a garish purple tint. That machine will do 4k HDR at 120hz VRR just fine, just not Dolby Vision.\n\n---\n\nSo... pick your poison. The most flexible setup is to give up and use different machines -- rooted NVIDIA Shield Pro for streaming from your NAS, the smart TV itself can do Youtube/Amazon/Netflix if the Shield ever refuses to (or if you have some weird thing like Dolby Vision), separate PC or console for games (I use a Windows machine for this), and obviously a separate NAS or Jellyfin server.\n\nThe simplest setup is probably just to plug in a Windows PC and use it for everything.",

The cables are expensive enough, but there are no restrictions stopping the exact same AMD GPUs, with the exact same open source Linux drivers, from delivering even more than HDMI 2.1 does.\n\nProblem is finding a TV that actually has a DisplayPort input.\n\nOr finding a DisplayPort -> HDMI adapter that actually works for this purpose. Both DisplayPort and USB-C can carry the HDMI protocol, and this is obviously the technologically superior way to do it -- less hardware in the adapters (and less for them to screw up), and the GPU and drivers support HDMI anyway, right? Except this also means AMD GPUs on Linux will have the same restrictions as they would with an HDMI cable, or with a USB-C -> DisplayPort adapter. You can even daisy-chain USB-C -> DisplayPort -> HDMI and *still* have that problem.",

The OPS PC controls the \"TV\" and streams data to it. It's like attaching a miniPC to a normal TV, but the TV doesn't have all the consumer crap, often doesn't have an IRDA receiver (so some joker can't turn it off with a remote control), and there's negligible cables to run.\n\nHere's a cheesy Intel video on the topic: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/content-details/612705/introduction-to-the-intel-open-pluggable-specification-video.html\n\nThe massive downside is that the displays sold in this segment are intended for 24/7 operation with no maintenance, somewhat harsh environment operation, often have wide viewing angles and bright displays (as they're effectively signage), and cost a *lot*. Similarly for the OPS form-factor PCs (even though they're just mini PCs in a different container, with a fancy OPS connector on the back).",

To your favourite PC install something like a Hauppauge TV tuner card and its associated software, use your regular TV as a monitor and your are done. If you have a laptop use a USB TV tuner card. Plug it into the internet for streaming services, gaming etc.\n\nYour are not restricted to using only Happauge's software there alternatives like NextPVR. \n\nThe only thing you have be careful about is buying TV tuner card of the correct type NTSC or DVB.",

I see lots and lots of complaints but I sometimes prefer FreeCAD over solidworks particularly when it comes to simulation stuff and I have access to both which tells me the software isn’t the problem.\n\nEdit: I do however understand the desire for the software to just work and be familiar, however the problem space is pretty far into the complex side so getting something better is quite unlikely and will just have to let the people that know what they’re doing, do it.",

Tooling like blender has come a long way but possibly still isn't at parity to the experience that app offered (all it focused on was UV mapping). I remember it's original name was something like Unfold3D but it was rebranded years ago.\n\nLikewise was a baking app for textures. You can do similar with blender, which I haven't looked into the past couple years, but last I looked it wasn't as good of a flow for the work I was doing. I think we used an app called CrazyBake or something like that? I wanted to build an OSS version myself similar to it but there wasn't easily accessible info on how to project/transfer textures / normals / etc. If I were to tackle such today I'd probably look at what blender is doing and port that.\n\nAnother one in this space that was pretty cool I unfortunately can't recall the name of either. I think it was under Intel, Adobe, or Autodesk (probably these guys). It was a small app focused on various operations for mesh modifications and had some features I quite liked but some features were done a bit poorly UX wise that I'd want. At the time I also used some OSS software (including blender) that couldn't do whatever features it had as well, but it's feature set would fit in blender quite well.\n\nThere was also some pretty great stuff with 3Dcoat but I believe blender has been catching up there, so I can't comment much. I used 3D coat for mesh repair and retopology of photogrammetry / lidar constructed meshes.\n\nThen once that was done simplifying the mesh to something blender could handle, blender would decimate the mesh and be used to slice up a large static scene environment into chunks that would get the dense point cloud data for baking textures (after unwraps to udim tiles was handled by the software that excelled at that).\n\nAll OSS would be cool but at the time (and possibly today still) OSS could not compete in all areas effectively, otherwise I'd have adopted it.",

Instead of stitching these together with APIs and microservices, they can run in a single process, import each other's code directly, and share data.\n\nWe saw the JavaScript ecosystem expand while Python and Java developers got left behind with fragmented tooling. Node.js took over because it was easy but it locked teams into one language and left performance on the table.\n\nElide is unique because its the only runtime built on GraalVM (instead of V8), so you get access to npm, PyPI, and Maven in one project, compilers that run 10-20x faster with no warmup time, and a memory-safe runtime that closes a whole set of security vulnerabilities.\n\nNow technically, were not faster than some JS runtimes like Bun, but that's a reality we want to make happen really soon!\n\nI've gotten great feedback from JVM developers and were really trying to get as many eyes on this as possible so that we can continue to improve and build for the dev community. (I've realized that when trying to promote my projects its not necessarily what you say as much as it is where you say it.)\n\nQuestions and critiques are always welcome.\n\nGithub: [https://github.com/elide-dev/elide](https://github.com/elide-dev/elide)",

I initially treated it as a numbers game, but that fell on its face pretty hard.\n\nI've posted our project on r/javascript and r/typescript where the posts did terribly. In hindsight, those communities are used to hearing about runtimes, and the polyglot angle seems gimmicky to them which is totally fair.\n\nThe JVM developers at r/java and r/Kotlin saw the project and immediately were able to see some value. Compilation times, advanced tooling, etc. These posts were often targeted to be more informational than promotional, but I always put the GitHub link to try and funnel them to our actual project.\n\nDevs are hard to convince. The analogy I keep in mind is that I'm trying to show and convince a chef to try out and use my cookbook. \n\nFrom two posts alone we were able to get real contributions (with 4 forks and over 50 stars!) So the fact that we are OSS helps A TON because (with the same analogy) now the chef is helping me write my cookbook.\n\nI completely pivoted and instead of trying to make people care, find people who already care.\n\nDistribution really is the hard part for me, but I guess there's a reason why the award is called \"Best Selling Author\" and not \"Best Writing Author.\"",

It’s not designed to be embedded or to interoperate with other managed runtimes. Unlike Python, JavaScript, or Ruby, there’s no interpreter to plug into and no straightforward way to run Go code inside GraalVM’s Truffle framework.\n\nThat isn’t to say that it’s impossible though",

My college internet sucks so I have used almost all major download managers.\n\nIDM is solid but paid, closed-source, and for Windows. Most open source options like XDM are not being maintained actively. Some of these apps are also heavy weight desktop apps.\n\nI wanted something lightweight and fast. So I decided to build one in Golang to really understand networking, concurrency, and low-level file handling. As a second year student I knew very little about these things before this project.\n\nSo I built Surge. It supports\n\n* Parallel connections,\n* Resumable downloads,\n* Beautiful TUI built with Bubbletea and Lipgloss\n\nBenchmarks: On my setup (1 GB file, \\~360 Mbps connection) surge is 1.38x faster than aria2 and as fast as XDM and FDM. This project has exceeded my expectations and I am proud to share it.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/junaid2005p/surge](https://github.com/junaid2005p/surge)\n\nI’m a student developer and this is my attempt to give back to the FOSS community. I’m actively looking for feedback, bug reports, and contributors.\n\n**tldr**: Built an open-source terminal download manager in Go to learn concurrency + networking. It ended up \\~1.4x faster than aria2 in my tests.",

Few people showed interest but no one contacted me with a concrete plan, task, work group... \n\nSo designers who are contributing to os, can you say a bit about it? How did you start? How does it work day to day? I'm asking volunteer contributors and designeres who are employed in os companies. I'm also interested in developers experiences working with designers, or hiw dones it work if theres no designers on a project. ",

          "text": "OS typically means Operating System, while FOSS is usually used to refer to Free & Open Source Software.\n\nFrom a UX professional perspective, the average FOSS project is not well positioned to leverage design resources in the way most for-profit projects are.\n\nCommercial software has come to recognize that design is often crucial before the development stages and sees over arching UX as a essential to producing competitive software that is also profitable. Even in this world developers are not keen to accomodate design even if they have overwhelming evidence their solutions do not resonate with users.\n\nIn this FOSS world, this is inverted. Since FOSS survives on volunteer developers and makes no real effort to profit beyond what pays developer, they lead the features and product as a unified user experience is all but ignored - Primarily for lack of awareness.\n\nThat being said, FOSS projects will likely only use a developer type bug ticketing system - so you'll often need to submit tickets on features already built and implemented - which as all UXers know is not likely to yeild a space for designers to do much but triage the worst of the UX.\n\nGood luck, it;s a world that need better UX design.",

          "text": "Not letting people off the hook for ghosting you, but when the core team of developers are primarily focusing on day to day issues, on-boarding potential contributors, even highly skilled ones, can inadvertently take a back seat. And design tends to happen at the start or when there's an overhaul. What work is available may be piecemeal.\n\nPerhaps lean towards accessibility. This is something a lot of open-source developers care about but are not always sufficiently knowledgeable or skilled enough to address fully.\n\nIf you have the time and energy, rather than being stuck until one day you might be properly inducted by one particular project, just start downloading / installing / self-hosting those projects that interest you, then carry out user experience and accessibility QA and submit those issues on GitHub. Tagging these as UX audit or accessibility improvement will likely get attention that leads to more substantial involvement.",

If you're interested in building FOSS tools for scientists, you'd be quite welcome! \n\nIt would probably be more efficient to implement your designs directly in the front end (React) or simply provide feedback (e.g., [this PR](https://github.com/calkit/calkit/pull/652#issuecomment-3704026308)) versus handing off mockups or whatever. Doing usability testing with users would also helpful.\n\nI've never worked with a designer on an open source project though. I assume most devs just do the design work themselves, which may be why the UX can sometimes be lacking compared to closed commercial software.",

I'm trying to figure out how a design roll generally works inside the opensource world. \nRegarding your suggestions that a design should be directly implemented in front end versus making mockups sounds unrealistic. Designers usually don't code, at least not on a level to have a final product. In my life I met only one person who can do a good design and good front end development, it's way rarer than finding a full stack developer for example.",

One way I could imagine it working would be to search GitHub for issues with labels like \"ux\" and \"design\" and comment on them, saying you can help. Then you upload mockups and other artifacts to the issue itself for feedback. Someone else then codes them up.\n\nIf you haven't already, it might be worth seeing how well AI tools can turn your designs into front end code that devs can work with.",
