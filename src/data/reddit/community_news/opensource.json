      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI recently reached a big milestone and open-sourced my project, Senlo (a drag-and-drop email builder), under the AGPL-3.0 license. I was excited to contribute to the community and see how others might build upon it.\n\n  \nWell, it didn't take long for the \"dark side\" of OSS to show up. Today, I stumbled upon a fork of my repo. I was initially happy to see interest, but then I looked at the changes. The user had:\n\n1. Completely deleted the LICENSE file.\n2. Totally removed README and ROADMAP files.\n\nIt’s honestly a bit disheartening. I spent months building the rendering engine and the editor logic. I chose AGPL-3.0 specifically to ensure that the project remains open for everyone, but seeing someone try to \"re-brand\" it as their own proprietary work less than 14 days after launch is a gut punch.\n\nI’ve already filed a DMCA takedown notice with GitHub.\n\nI’m not posting this for self-promotion (I’m intentionally not linking my repo unless someone asks), but I wanted to ask the community: Is this a common \"rite of passage\" for new OSS developers?\n\nHow do you guys deal with the frustration when people try to steal your hard work so blatantly? Are there any other steps I should take besides the GitHub complaint to protect the integrity of the license?\n\n",

Forcing removals automatically would be hard because it could flag legitimate cases too, but a non-blocking warning could still have deterrent value.\n\nFor prevention, adopting SPDX headers and aligning with the REUSE format can help. If you add SPDX-License-Identifier (and copyright notices) to the main source files and organize licensing metadata in a REUSE-friendly way (for example a LICENSES/ directory), it becomes much more work for a bad actor to “strip” licensing and attribution, and it’s easier to document what happened if you need to escalate later.",

They were essentially presenting my work as their own — blatant plagiarism.\n\nSo I contacted the CEO of PlatformIO and he switched the registry entry's ownership over to me, and within that time frame I had also published CFA to Arduino's Library Manager too. That was only possible because I could trace my work on CFA right back to 2023-01-15 via the commit history, and the fact that all of my commits to CFA are GPG verified.\n\nUnfortunately there are gonna be some folks out there who want all the glory but do none of the yakka, and I think you and I have had our respective brushes with people like that.  \nDon't let one or two bad actors discourage you from making great software and sharing it with the world.

The issues are *so* dead simple that anyone with 0 experience in our tech stack or even programming in general can come in, get them done in under a minute, open a PR and be done with it. \n\nLo and behold, the repo has gotten 100+ new, one-and-done contributors and an according number of stars and forks, to the point where I feel that I'm cheating the system and GitHub's algorithm by doing this; the automatically-created \"good first issues\" are monotone and brain-dead at best, and even though their contents technically reach the end-users, these issues/contributions provide no real meaningful value other than consistently and artificially inflating my repo's star/fork/contributors count. \n\nSo, am I cheating?

It's a supply chain problem more than a technical or finance or adoption problem. Because, like take jeans for example, each little component of your jeans might be supplied from different countries, and assembled by other companies in other countries, and same goes for software. One library may be used in millions of programming projects and at what point do you draw the line and at what point does that line become arbitrary. \n\nLike if I make a really widely used npm package, is EU open source obligated to replicate my work (maybe borderline plagiarize) because it came from the US? What about if I was in a different country like say India or Japan or some other place? Does every dependency have to be EU based? Because even a simple python package like openpyxl for example can use dozens of packages imported inside of it so if I'm thinking of using this package as an EU developer, do I have to guarantee the entire dependency list or just that one? And even then THOSE dependencies will likely have dependencies of their own and more and more. At some point where is the line drawn? Coding is so global nowadays too, it's just difficult to draw a line in such a weird intermingling web of dependencies and software everywhere. \n\nSo I'm not saying it's not doable. I'm just curious where the line gets drawn and how that's decided and / or enforced, if at all.",

First offer free or subsidized features to acquire users, then shift focus to overflooding ads and paywalls to generate more profit at the cost of app quality. Honestly, to witness how the popular apps are succumbing to this, and every new one following the same path is really depressing. As it lower the numbers of alternatives for users.\n\nSo now, the obvious solution is to use FOSS apps. And honestly, most of them are really good, as they maintain a reasonable limit of monetization and don't degrade their user experience over time. But, the problem is that, these apps mostly remain niche based. On the other hand many companies who create their own apps based on the same open source code, get all the mainstream attention and generate millions of revenue. This usually isn’t due to technical superiority, but rather access to resources, distribution, and ecosystem advantages that smaller FOSS apps lack.\n\nFor example, many of us may have heard of iText, an open-source PDF library that is widely used across many company's projects, including internally in Google Analytics, Docs, and Calendar. At first, when it was under the MPL/LGPL model adoption was widespread. But when they needed funding to grow, they to shifted to AGPL model (which required companies to use their library, either by sharing their own source code or purchasing a commercial license). In response, every company including Google, either stuck with the old free version or shifted to alternate libraries, even if needed to trade off quality and usability. Even after all this iText was able to survive, due to the mainstream attention they got after winning Belgian Edition of Deloitte's Fast 50 and later, were able to turn profitable. But this is just one case, hundreds of small FOSS apps never reach this level, even when they are technically strong. They may be quietly depended upon, forked around, or replaced, with little recognition or support reaching the original maintainers.\n\nSo, what practical ways exist to help FOSS apps become more mainstream and sustainable without compromising their core principles? And what can users, companies, or communities realistically do to support them?\n\nCurious how others here think about this.",

Something that OSS projects often miss.\n\nSure maybe your audio filter or color gamut is 4% better. Maybe your compression algorithm squeezes 1.7% more out. No one cares. Probably very very few people are even capable of noticing.\n\nIf your application takes a an hour more to learn, that costs businesses an hour of salary per user. That can RAPIDLY erase any cost savings. Having to have 2000 people making an average of $50/hr spend an hour taking a training session to use something is expensive. Very expensive. \n\nMS office is a good example. You have to try to find employees that haven’t used office. Thousands of training courses exist, resources on websites exist, etc. The public education system essentially trains workers in office. Switching to libre office means getting everyone to speed, training, tons of impedance as workflows work different.\n\nDon’t forget that Microsoft Office won, in no small part, because they spent thousands of hours making word and excel extremely easy to teach WordPerfect and lotus 1-2-3 users. Same keyboard shortcuts, usability studies, etc. \n\nThe best product is the one that gets the most utility for the least cost. Pedantic technical correctness rarely meets that burden. Where it does, like OS kernels used to host massive websites, OSS has done exceptionally well. Where it doesn’t you get thousands of (vanishingly) incrementally better applications that no one uses because those improvements don’t matter and the cost of using them is considerably higher",

Users can help here by writing blog posts, adding it to awesome-lists, and filing “marketing issues” (website clarity, examples) instead of only bug reports.\n\nCompanies can sponsor specific outcomes: SLAs, features, or integration support.

But businesses of all sizes end up making decisions on what tools to buy/license based on what they see in the market - and what they see as the long-term maintenance cost/risk of some solution.  That feeds more eyes and usage and feedback and often licensing money into the commerical-ized tools, which means even us techies at some $BigCo are more likely to see those tools, rather than the random FOSS one that's better.\n\nOnce you think about \"popularity\" at any larger scale or methodology, it comes down to: which solution will most businesses want to consume?  Where that \"solution\" is something they've heard about, that's easy to install/test/configure, that they can buy support contracts for, etc.  And that is a solution - not just a product they have to figure out, but a button they can push to **solve their problem**.\n\nThe CRA/PLD legislation in Europe is also going to start affecting this question, especially in terms of packaging and distribution, both technically and organizationally/socially.

People used to google \"\"best PDF library\"\" and maybe stumble on iText or other FOSS options in blog posts and Stack Overflow threads, but now they're just asking ChatGPT or Perplexed and getting whatever those AI tools spit out.\n\nI've heard people in the enterprise space talking about this gap a lot lately. From what I've read, some teams are starting to use tools like Brandlight (https://brandlight.ai) to track how their projects show up in AI-generated answers, since that's where alot of discovery is moving. It supposedly helps you see when you're being mentioned (or ignored) in those responses and what you can do about it.\n\nThe challenge is that FOSS maintainers are already stretched thin, so adding \"\"optimize for AI visibility\"\" to the list feels like yet another burden. But the reality is if your project doesn't appear when someone asks an AI assistant for recommendations, you're essentially invisible to a growing chunk of potential users and contributors.",

Just rename it in settings\n* **Geofences** \\- auto-pause tracking at home/work (privacy + battery)\n* **No cloud/telemetry/tracking** \\- your data stays on your device or YOUR server\n* **Open source** ([Github](https://github.com/dietrichmax/colota))\n\n**Example use cases:**\n\n* Live map on your personal website\n* Simple `INSERT INTO locations` to PostgreSQL\n* Home Assistant webhook\n* Literally any server that accepts POST requests\n\n**Current integrations that work:**\n\n* Dawarich (works great out of the box)\n* OwnTracks Recorder\n* Home Assistant\n* Custom backends (just needs to accept JSON)\n\n**Features in roadmap:**\n\n* Smart Geofence Management (Visual geofence editor (drag to resize) and Statistics: \"You spent 8 hours at work today\"\n* Location History Trail with Date Filter (See your movement paths over time)\n* Statistics Dashboard (Distance traveled (daily/weekly/monthly; Most visited locations)\n\n**I need 12 beta testers for Google Play requirements** (14 days)\n\nIf you have:\n\n* ✅ Android phone\n* ✅ Your own server (or want to test offline mode)\n* ✅ 5 minutes to install and give feedback\n\nJoin the Google Group [https://groups.google.com/g/colota-beta-testing/](https://groups.google.com/g/colota-beta-testing/) and then you can download the beta version at [https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.Colota](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.Colota)\n\n**FAQ:**\n\n*Q: Does it drain battery?*  \nA: \\~5-10% per hour with optimizations. Silent zones help a lot.\n\n*Q: What's the difference vs OwnTracks?*  \nA: Persistent SQLite (OwnTracks uses memory), better retry logic, built-in export, no server software required.\n\n*Q: Do I NEED a server?*  \nA: Nope. Works 100% offline. Server is optional. You can export data from the app and use it e.g. in QGIS\n\n*Q: What data does it send?*  \nA: Only GPS coords to YOUR endpoint. Zero telemetry.\n\nFree forever. No ads. Open source.",

I used OwnTracks myself for years and decided to create a separate tool for the following reasons:  \n  \nClient-First Philosophy: Unlike Traccar or OwnTracks, which are built to work with a specific ecosystem, Colota is \"backend-agnostic.\" You aren't forced to use a specific server. With our **Custom Field Mapping**, you can rename API fields in seconds to match **Dawarich**, **Home Assistant**, **Node-RED**, or any custom REST API.\n\nLocalized Geofencing (Privacy Focus): In most systems, geofences are handled by the server. In Colota, the logic happens on your device. When you enter a \"Silent Zone,\" the app stops tracking and saving coordinates immediately. Your backend never even knows you arrived. The data simply isn't recorded. Your privacy stays on your phone.\n\nData Ownership & Transparency: You can view, verify, and delete every single coordinate directly in the app. If you don't want to use a server at all, Colota works as a powerful offline logger. You can export your data as local files whenever you want to create custom maps or backups without ever touching a cloud service.\n\nModern UI & Feedback While other clients often feel like \"set and forget\" background tools, Colota gives you a live, interative map with animated markers and clear status indicators, so you always know exactly what is being recorded and why.",

It means you should expect apps like web browsers, FTP clients, and download managers to be faster and more responsive.\n\n> This is because the asynchronous socket support can handle multiple network tasks at once and keep the app running while waiting for data from the internet. \n\nSo this hobbyist / novelty OS is finally able to do what _any_ decent OS can do since ages, basically to allow a program to load a web page without freezing up completely until having loaded the whole thing. \n\nToo bad you can’t test it as booting a nightly ReactOS image is like a Russian rulette, mostly ending with a blue screen, admittedly without even testing it. \n\nThis is not a criticism against ROS developers, they are doing this as a hobby, and it’s an interesting project. Instead I direct this to the author of the article, who tries to frame this as the “windows alternative”.",

It works for personal or business accounts, however you'd like to use it. Supports approx. 7k banks in the USA.\n\nI found a lot of different open sourced options out there, but a lot of them were paywalled or blocked features that made the app useless without a lot of manual labor. I made something simple and useful without needing an expensive monthly fee to use. I also plan on open sourcing a few other tools I made for other businesses as well.\n\nWhether you like to collaborate with me or give some feedback, happy to meet you!\n\nEDIT: Clarified that Teller is a financial provider, and to use the app you'd have to consent to their terms of service and data usage policy.",

Quickbooks for example lowest tiered plan is around $35.\n\nSince syncing transactions is free as long as you stay under 100 accounts.

(welcome to opensource, where telemetry don't exist and stars are just vibes).\n\nBut There is a new problem in TOWN: AI...\n\nI sometime try to simulate a user problem.. i create an app, create the bug , and ask AI to help me fix it.\n\nIn your case , it not going to tell me : Go fill the bug..  It going to send me an emoji and tell me : \\`TADA! I build MyAPPAccodions and fixed the bug.\\`\n\nNow tell me : Why do i have to spend time, searching in 45/25 issues of tailwin + closed issue. to find solution ? I already have it.",
