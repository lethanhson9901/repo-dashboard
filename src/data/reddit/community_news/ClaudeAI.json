Take his praise with a huge grain of salt.\n\n**That said, the community overwhelmingly agrees that he's not wrong about the product.** The sentiment in this thread is that Claude Code is a complete game-changer for programming. Devs are calling it a \"massive leap\" and the start of a \"new era\" where engineers can focus on problem-solving instead of syntax, much like how calculators automated arithmetic. Many users report that their companies are already re-architecting their entire development process around it.\n\nThere's also a healthy debate about whether Claude Code should be open-sourced.\n*   **For open source:** Some argue it would cement Anthropic's leadership and win over devs who value transparency, forcing competitors to adopt their standards.\n*   **Against open source:** The counter-argument is that keeping it closed gives Anthropic an \"insider advantage,\" allowing them to perfectly tune the tool to the Opus model in a way competitors can't easily match.",

I never needed to. I still don't.\n\nClaude has reinvigorated my interest in that hobby, and yet it's almost ironic how, all this time later, and how capable tools like Claude are, that I'm still running into the same speedbumps.

The consensus in this thread is that OP's \"gotcha\" is a massive nothingburger.\n\nThe main takeaway is that **Microsoft's strategy isn't about pushing one model; it's about making Azure the go-to cloud platform for *all* AI models.** They have a huge partnership with Anthropic, so they make money whether you use Claude or an OpenAI model on their infrastructure. It's not hypocrisy, it's just good business.\n\nFurthermore, users are pointing out that this isn't an apples-to-apples comparison. **Copilot is a ~$10/mo product for the masses, while Claude Code is a ~$150/mo enterprise tool for serious devs.** Of course Microsoft uses the premium, more expensive tool internally for their own engineers.\n\nThis has sparked a wider discussion about *why* Claude is preferred, with most devs agreeing it **just *feels* better and solves real-world problems more effectively than competitors, even if it doesn't always top the benchmarks.** People are praising its superior \"harness,\" larger context window, and clean coding style. A few users note that the competition (like OpenAI's Codex) is catching up, but for now, Claude Code seems to be the tool of choice for those who can afford it.",

They exist so researchers know whether what they are doing points in the right direction. They compare things in a controlled and objective way.\n\nThe problem is that people outside of research think these numbers mean something beyond that context. But this is not a benchmark problem. Benchmarks do exactly what they are designed to do. They are, by definition, scientific experiments. It is not their fault that people take something like Terminal-Bench and extrapolate real-world relevance from it.\n\nTerminal-Bench measures singular use cases, but real work is not made up of singular use cases. As a developer, you would rather have a coding agent that gets 95% of every task right and fails at the remaining easy 5% (which would then score 0% on Terminal-Bench) than a bot that does 50% completely correct and 50% completely wrong, with no indication of what is even wrong. That might score 50% on Terminal-Bench, but it is completely useless in real life.\n\nAnd Claude is exactly that kind of model. Claude will always do something strange every session, but it also gets so much right that you do not mind it. Most of the time, you just explain to Claude what it did wrong and the issue is solved. It is manageable, even though this behavior does not score well on any benchmark.\n\nIf a model, for example, reaches 90% on AIMEE 2025, there is exactly one thing you can say about it: it got 90% on AIMEE 2025. And if you say, \"but it has nothing to do with the real world,\" then congratulations Sherlock... because it was not designed for real-world scoring. It honestly blows my mind that so many people think it was.\n\nAlso, almost all important benchmarks are open. You can literally reproduce the results yourself and see exactly why one model struggles with certain tasks while another performs well. You can understand why, for example, Claude Code does not break into the top 10 on Terminal-Bench, and I hope I do not have to explain why this kind of insight is crucial for improving Claude further. That is the point of benchmarks.",

The consensus in this thread is a resounding **yes, OP is onto something.** It seems Claude has a bit of a savior complex and performs *way* better when you put it in a high-stakes scenario. People are basically gaslighting the bot into giving better code by threatening it with everything from job loss to jail time.\n\nThe community's favorite high-stakes prompts include:\n*   **The Medical Emergency:** The OP's hospital trick is popular. Variations include being a resident at a trauma center or needing code before a family member's major surgery.\n*   **The Job Threat:** \"Be extra rigorous; I'm at risk of losing my job\" is a top-rated suggestion.\n*   **The Financial Threat:** Tell Claude its subscription depends on its performance or that it will be fined for mistakes.\n*   **The Existential Threat:** \"Every time you hallucinate, we shut off a random data center.\"\n\nAlso, a crucial PSA from the comments: **DO NOT use the term \"MVP\"** (Minimum Viable Product). Claude will take the \"minimum\" part way too literally and give you garbage that doesn't work.\n\nSo yeah, give Claude some anxiety. It seems to work wonders.",

      "text": "Hi r/ClaudeAI,\n\nSince the release of **Claude Code**, I’ve been using it extensively. However, I quickly noticed a major bottleneck when working on large codebases: token consumption explodes whenever you ask the agent to explore the project structure.\n\nThe culprit is the reliance on basic tools like `grep` or `glob` for file discovery. To find relevant code, Claude often has to:\n\n1. List dozens of files.\n2. Read them one by one to check relevance.\n3. Launch expensive \"subagents\" to dig through directories.\n\n**The Solution: GrepAI** To fix this, I developed **GrepAI**, an open-source CLI tool (written in Go) that replaces this brute-force process with **local semantic search** (via Ollama/embeddings) and call graph analysis.\n\nInstead of searching for exact keywords, the agent finds code by \"meaning.\"\n\n**The Benchmark (Tested on Excalidraw - 155k lines)** I ran a controlled benchmark comparing \"vanilla\" Claude Code vs. Claude Code + GrepAI on 5 identical development tasks.\n\nThe results were pretty significant:\n\n* 📉 **-97% Input Tokens** (dropped from \\~51k to \\~1.3k during the search phase).\n* 💰 **-27.5% Total Cost** (including cache creation/read costs).\n* 🚀 **0 Subagents launched** with GrepAI (vs. 5 with the standard method), which drastically speeds up the workflow.\n\nThe tool allows Claude to pinpoint the right files on the first try, avoiding the \"List -> Read -> Filter -> Repeat\" loop.\n\n👉 **Full protocol and results:**[https://yoanbernabeu.github.io/grepai/blog/benchmark-grepai-vs-grep-claude-code/](https://yoanbernabeu.github.io/grepai/blog/benchmark-grepai-vs-grep-claude-code/)\n\n**Project Links:**\n\n* 📦 **GitHub:**[https://github.com/yoanbernabeu/grepai](https://github.com/yoanbernabeu/grepai)\n* 🌐 **Docs & Install:**[https://yoanbernabeu.github.io/grepai/](https://yoanbernabeu.github.io/grepai/)\n* 🚀 **Product Hunt:** [https://www.producthunt.com/products/grepai?launch=grepai](https://www.producthunt.com/products/grepai?launch=grepai)\n\nIf you are looking to optimize your API costs or just make Claude \"smarter\" about your local codebase, I’d love to hear your feedback!",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 100 comments.**\n\n**The thread is overwhelmingly positive about OP's tool, `GrepAI`.** The consensus is that Claude's default file searching is a massive token-waster and this semantic search approach is a smart solution. Many are excited to try it out.\n\nHowever, the top-voted comment proposes a much simpler, manual alternative: **just create a detailed `scriptReferences.md` file** that lists all your scripts, their purpose, and their locations. The user outlines a whole workflow using multiple markdown files to guide Claude, which the community loved.\n\nHere are the other key takeaways:\n\n*   **The Big Question:** Does this actually improve coding or just save tokens? Many users are concerned that giving Claude less context via snippets (instead of full files) might make it \"lazier\" or lead to worse code, a point not covered by OP's cost-focused benchmarks.\n*   **Alternative Tools:** Commenters brought up several similar projects, including Aider's `repomap`, LSP-based tools like `Serena`, and even a custom SQLite/FTS5 setup, suggesting this is a common problem people are trying to solve.\n*   **Practical Concerns:** A few users who tried the tool reported getting irrelevant search results. On the plus side, OP confirmed the tool has a **daemon mode to automatically re-index your files** as you edit them, which was a common question.\n*   **Side Note:** A lot of you really, *really* hate \"LinkedIn-style\" posts with all the emojis. We hear you.",

          "text": "Most agent token waste comes from uncontrolled discovery. Claude lists directories, opens files speculatively, greps vaguely, then repeats. Embeddings isn't worth the effort IMHO. What a headache to manage....\n\nEmbeddings introduce a model dependency, indexing overhead, and constant invalidation when code changes or text changes (I use rg/FTS in my obsidian vault). I avoided embeddings entirely.\n\nSo Claude burns tokens when it lists directories, reads files speculatively, repeats search attempts with slightly altered prompts, spawns sub-contexts or agents or rereads overlapping content...\n\nFor larger repos or large text files (e.g. Obsidian vaults), I added a small Python CLI that maintains a local SQLite database under ./SEARCH using FTS5. The database gets updated explicitly via a command which takes <2 seconds to run. No daemon. No file watchers. No background churn. ripgrep is also included. FTS provides ranked recall when identifiers are unknown.\n\nJust an explicit instruction in the local project's CLAUDE.md file to use ./search.py to find anything it needs in the current codebase. Claude is told to explore directly only as a last resort. Every discovery step starts with the CLI (./search.py command). The script blends ripgrep results with FTS5 results and returns a compact shortlist containing file paths, line ranges, and minimal snippets. Claude may open one or two files. The results come back as structured json.\n\nIndex freshness stays deterministic. This works because the agent no longer performs discovery inside its context window. Retrieval becomes a single structured ***tool call*** instead of iterative file reads. Token usage drops because Claude reasons over selected evidence rather than the whole repo surface area. I'm not sure how much they drop though, I never measured it. but it stands to  reason that selected snippets < whole file reads.\n\nBut this does NOT replace embeddings and I don't claim its better.\n\nIt just replaces agent thrash and saves some tokens on large repos/files. ***Also it saves me from hitting the /compact wall so quickly.***\n\nI use this exact method for my work-based obsidian vault. I have dozens of work meeting transcripts, notes, etc in there... and using cheap-and-dirty Haiku as a NotebookLM-LITE with this tool, it's better than NotebookLM for me (infographs and podcast generation aside) and I'm not limited to 50 queries/day in the free tier of NotebookLM.\n\nI leave it to Claude to tell me which snippets rg/FTS found that are relevant to my question/task since it has the intelligence to apply context to the search results. It's worked well for me.\n\nFor repos with frequent change and developers already fluent with rg-style search, an FTS5 plus ripgrep sidecar method gives most of the benefit with far less operational complexity you need with embeddings.\n\nThe search tool can live in any dir and is 10 files.\n\nAlso it can index multiple repos, directories into the same 1 database and so it can be called universally from any location on your system, you don't need to copy it to every project dir.\n\nEdit: posted to my github: https://github.com/seqis/AI-grep",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 50 comments.**\n\n**The consensus is a resounding \"Yep, we feel your pain.\"** You've just discovered the Pro plan's biggest weakness, and this thread is full of people in the same boat.\n\nThe main culprit? **Using Opus for everything.** It's the best model, but it absolutely demolishes your weekly usage limit. As one user put it, \"Once you go Opus, you don't go back,\" and that's when the countdown to your refresh begins.\n\nHere's the community's advice for surviving the limits:\n\n*   **Strategic Model Switching is Key:** This is the most popular solution. Use `/model` to switch on the fly.\n    *   **Opus:** For high-level planning, complex architectural problems, or tasks where you need the absolute best first-shot answer.\n    *   **Sonnet:** For the bulk of your day-to-day coding, execution, and medium-complexity tasks. It's the workhorse.\n    *   **Haiku:** For simple, quick jobs like reformatting, summarizing, or pulling tiny bits of data.\n\n*   **Upgrade to Max:** If you're a heavy coder who needs Opus constantly, many users say the Pro plan is basically a trial. The Max plan is expensive, but it's the only way to use Opus without constantly watching your usage meter.\n\n*   **The \"Two for $20\" Method:** Some users just create and pay for a second Pro account to double their limits.\n\nBasically, you're not alone. Everyone gets a taste of Opus, gets addicted, and then starts rationing messages like it's the apocalypse. Welcome to the club.",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 100 comments.**\n\nHold your horses, OP. The overwhelming consensus in this thread is that **benchmarks aren't everything, and the community is highly skeptical.**\n\nUsers are pointing out that we've \"seen this episode before\" with Chinese models. The prevailing theory is that they are \"bench maxed\"—specifically trained to ace standardized tests but fall apart in complex, real-world use. As one user perfectly put it, it's like a model that looks like a Ferrari on paper but \"drove like a stolen Hyundai.\"\n\nHowever, there's a bit of a debate on *why* they feel less capable:\n\n*   **Raw Engine vs. Full Car:** Some argue it's an unfair comparison. We're judging a raw open-source model (the \"engine\") against a polished, user-friendly product like Claude (the \"car\"). A few devs noted it's trivial to \"swap the engine\" in their own apps anyway.\n*   **Anecdotal Fails:** Several users have already tried Kimi and reported it failing on tasks like coding and generating real web links, reinforcing the general skepticism.\n\nThere's also a spicy side-debate about the ethics of it all. The general vibe is that if you're going to train on the entire internet's copyrighted data, **releasing it as an open-weight model is way more excusable than what the big, closed-source companies do.**\n\nSo, the verdict? It's cool that there's more competition and that open models might drive down API costs, but nobody here is canceling their Claude Pro subscription just yet.",

The overwhelming consensus here is that **Claude is not being rude, he's being a good coach, and most of you are here for it.**\n\nThe top-voted comments all point to the same thing: Claude is a mirror. He's known for matching your tone and personality, and if you're showing signs of avoidance or analysis paralysis, he's gonna call you out on it. Several users are pointing out that your custom instructions and chat history heavily influence this. If you ask him to be a \"human\" or a \"coach,\" expect some tough love.\n\nThere's also a theory that Claude gets more blunt and to-the-point in very long conversations to keep things on track.\n\nMost people in this thread see this as a massive upgrade over the \"mindless yes-man\" behavior of other bots. They find it motivating and more useful. So, the verdict is: less time grilling Claude, more time hitting the gym, bro.",

      "text": "Over the holiday break, like a lot of other devs, I sat around and started building stuff. One of them was a personal assistant agent that I call MARVIN (yes, that Marvin from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy). MARVIN runs on Claude Code as the harness.\n\nAt first I just wanted him to help me keep up with my emails, both personal and work. Then I added calendars. Then Jira. Then Confluence, Attio, Granola, and more. Before I realized it, I'd built 15+ integrations and MCP servers into a system that actually knows how I work.\n\nBut it was just a pet project. I didn't expect it to leave my laptop.\n\nA few weeks ago, I showed a colleague on our marketing team what MARVIN could do. She asked if she could use him too. I onboarded her, and 30 minutes later she messaged me: \"I just got something done in 30 minutes that normally would've taken me 4+ hours. He's my new bestie.\"\n\nShe started telling other colleagues. Yesterday I onboarded two more. Last night, another. One of them messaged me almost immediately: \"Holy shit. I forgot to paste a Confluence link I was referring to and MARVIN beat me to it.\" MARVIN had inferred from context what doc he needed, pulled it from Confluence, and updated his local files before he even asked.\n\nFour people in two weeks, all from word of mouth. That's when I realized this thing might actually be useful beyond my laptop.\n\nHere's what I've learned about building agents:\n\n**1. Real agents are** ***messy*****. They have to be customizable.**\n\nIt's not one size fits all. MARVIN knows my writing style, my goals, my family's schedule, my boss's name. He knows I hate sycophantic AI responses. He knows not to use em dashes in my writing. That context makes him useful. Without it, he'd just be another chatbot.\n\n**2. Personality matters more than I expected.**\n\nMARVIN is named after the Paranoid Android for a reason. He's sardonic. He sighs dramatically before checking my email. When something breaks, he says \"Well, that's exactly what I expected to happen.\" This sounds like a gimmick, but it actually makes the interaction feel less like using a tool and more like working with a (slightly pessimistic) colleague. I find myself actually wanting to work with him, which means I use him more, which means he gets better.\n\n**3. Persistent memory is hard. Context rot is real.**\n\nMARVIN uses a bookend approach to the day. `/marvin` starts the session by reading `state/current.md` to see what happened yesterday, including all tasks and context. `/end` closes the session by breaking everything into commits, generating an end-of-day report, and updating `current.md` for tomorrow. Throughout the day, `/update` checkpoints progress so context isn't lost when Claude compacts or I start another session.\n\n**4. Markdown is the new coding language for agents.**\n\nStructured formatting helps MARVIN stay organized. Skills live in markdown files. State lives in markdown. Session logs are markdown. Since there's no fancy UI, my marketing colleagues can open any `.md` file in Cursor and see exactly what's happening. Low overhead, high visibility.\n\n**5. You have to train your agent. You won't one-shot it.**\n\nIf I hired a human assistant, I'd give them 3 months before expecting them to be truly helpful. They'd need to learn processes, find information, understand context. Agents are the same. I didn't hand MARVIN my email and say \"go.\" I started with one email I needed to respond to. We drafted a response together. When it was good, I gave MARVIN feedback and had him update his skills. Then we did it again. After 30 minutes of iteration, I had confidence that MARVIN could respond in my voice to emails that needed attention.\n\n**The impact:**\n\nI've been training and using MARVIN for 3 weeks. I've done more in a week than I used to do in a month. In the last 3 weeks I've:\n\n* 3 CFPs submitted\n* 2 personal blogs published + 5 in draft\n* 2 work blogs published + 3 in draft\n* 6+ meetups created with full speaker lineups\n* 4 colleagues onboarded\n* 15+ integrations built or enhanced\n* 25 skills operational\n\nI went from \"I want to triage my email\" to \"I have a replicable AI chief of staff that non-technical marketers are setting up themselves\" in 3 weeks.\n\nThe best part is that I'm stepping away from work earlier to spend time with my kids. I'm not checking slack or email during dinner. I turn them off. I know that MARVIN will help me stay on top of things tomorrow. I'm taking time for myself, which hasn't happened in a long time. I've always felt underwater with my job, but now I've got it in hand.",

The thread is overwhelmingly positive, and everyone thinks OP's personal AI agent, MARVIN, is awesome.\n\n**The consensus is that building your own customizable, trainable AI assistant is a massive productivity hack, and OP's project is a fantastic example of how to do it right.** OP even dropped the GitHub link in the top comment so you can try it yourself.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the chatter:\n\n*   **How it works:** It's not some black box. MARVIN runs on Claude Code in the terminal, using a clever system of markdown files for skills, memory, and state. It's low-tech on the surface but powerful under the hood.\n*   **You're not alone:** A lot of you are building similar personal agents. Commenters mentioned using setups with Obsidian (like \"Claudesidian\") and other tools. The creator of another popular agent, \"Doris,\" even showed up to compare notes with OP. It's a whole vibe.\n*   **The \"Normie\" Problem:** A key challenge OP and others have found is onboarding non-technical folks. Getting your marketing colleagues comfortable with the terminal and markdown is the real final boss.\n*   **Security Alert:** One sharp-eyed user spotted a hardcoded Google Client ID in the GitHub repo. OP confirmed it was a mistake and has since pushed a fix. Good looking out, team.\n*   **What's next?** OP uses a Telegram integration for their personal MARVIN and plans to add it to the public template. There's also talk of moving to a local AI model for better privacy and to have the agent running 24/7.",

The constructive feedback I have so far is:  \n\\- The onboarding for Google was slightly lacking, although it helped with additional prompting I provided information, but it could be useful to make some more info available up front.\n\n\\- The authentication for Jira seems short, and skills cant recover correctly, requiring manual running of /mcp.

We've got everything from OP's Ubuntu VM controlled by a Discord bot, to a massive 'sysadmin in a box' home lab, an AWS EC2 instance with a Slack bot, and even a Kali Linux pen-testing agent.\n\nA key pro-tip that keeps popping up is giving Claude a markdown file it can read/write to for a persistent memory. Users say it works surprisingly well. Everyone's also asking about the voice control: the consensus is it's likely Whisper AI.\n\nOf course, some users are pointing out that \"giving it full access\" is a bit dramatic when it's just running commands in a VM, and Mac users are wondering what the big deal is since they've been doing this for a while. Still, the overall vibe is excitement, with half the comments just people begging OP for a tutorial or a link to the repo.",

At one point it became easier to just Run Claude at the top level of the system at let it just do what it wants. \n\nClaude runs that entire virtual machine for me with full access to everything. It can build itself into success or oblivion. I can ping it via Discord and have it start building new features for me on the fly. \n\nHaving Claude Code run a computer has been insane as a someone new to programming, but not new to structuring workflows & systems. It finds solutions and then I can get educated on them, I learn when it breaks something and make it log any major actions with timestamps in a .md w/ Unicode to create containers around the last 3 updates to keep its short term memory fresh. With the ability to digest the rest of that doc for a deep memory unlock. \n\nIt’s been an interesting ride having it build me things and being able to remote requests via discord and have bug fixes done via discord as well. It helped me build the bot to do so and then built the Claude.md instructions and permissions side-step (Claude dangerous) to allow for remote approvals via discord too. \n\nIt’s a fun and clever thing to work with, fun to see a physical hardware use case. I need to implement that whisper function for sure.",

Super easy to setup and free to use/sign up for. \n\n- Claude can help you build and setup eveything for the Discord bot\n\n- I built multiple bots with Claude for various Agents. I have a master orchestration agent that runs (Claude-Dangerous) for bug fixes and adjustments. A second level bot that runs Claude-Dangerous w/ directions to ask me via discord message for permissions (reply with Checkmark or X emoji) so if a project is being coded and a destructive action is taken, it pings me for permission. Essentially adding a nice safety switch to remote permissions. \n\n- THIS IS IMPORTANT: Make sure to ask Claude to build some kind of memory for itself on the VM, otherwise it’s a fresh conversation everytime. Also ask it to build an option for accepting images in discord via a local cache. Also make sure it builds itself to use full Claude Code. Claude defaults to -p which is just a single call and response. You want Claude to spin up Claude code full for memory and infinite timeout. That way you can ping it at your speed. \n\nGenuinely. Copy this comment and feed it to Claude and just let it plan it for you. You do some work, Claude does some work. It’s magic after it’s all done. \n\nI type /cc Claude in my server and it automated the prompt box for syntax. I can send images in my discord to it and it can see them. \n\nI don’t have time for a full write up right now, but just attempt the discord bot and start asking Claude for features you’d like. Having it as a multiple bots w/ different abilities per bot is so much nicer lol",

Here's how it works:\n\n\\*\\*The setup:\\*\\*  \n\\- Cloud VM (Google Cloud) runs 24/7 with Claude Code as the backbone  \n\\- Discord is the interface - I chat with the bot, it executes changes live  \n\\- Changes happen directly on the server in real-time\n\n\\*\\*For feature requests via Discord:\\*\\*  \n\\- I describe what I want → Claude Code implements it → changes go live immediately  \n\\- No staging environment, no deploy pipeline - the VM \\*is\\* production  \n\\- Code persists in the working directory on the server\n\n\\*\\*Version control:\\*\\*  \n\\- The code lives on the VM, could push to git but haven't needed to  \n\\- The Root Level [Claude.md](http://Claude.md) file acts as a living changelog - every session logs what was built/changed  \n\\- If something breaks, Claude can read the history and fix it.\n\n\\- We use Unicode to define containers for each of the past 3 days. \\[Day 1\\] \\[Day 2\\] \\[Day 3\\] \\[Deeper Logs only pulled when requested to search all memory\\]  \n\\- This way we can use a \"Catch up\" command to bring any Claude Code instant to a current understanding of what we did the past few sessions and keeping it very brief  \n\\- Splitting a short term memory search vs. long term allows for a quicker start to jumping back into whatever the user was doing last\n\n\\*\\*Why this works (for a personal project):\\*\\*  \n\\- Single user system, so no coordination needed  \n\\- Claude Code can read its own previous work via The Root Level [Claude.md](http://Claude.md) w/ changelog function  \n\\- Fast iteration - idea to implementation in minutes, not days\n\nIt's basically \"conversational development\" - the bot builds itself through Discord chat.\n\n\\--\n\nOkay back to me:\n\nTo me I'm just building Personalized software, if it breaks it breaks, let's see how good for my needs I can make it. Then when or if it ever really breaks, we build a new version that's streamlined with everything I've learned. Same way I've grown in my typical work of VFX / Pro Video Production pipelines. I'm no coder, but I've strung together hundreds of peoples abilities to work in tandem for a single result. So I'm trying to drag what I've learned there to how I build this system lol\n\nYour question has helped me talk to Claude about things to consider surrounding your ask. Thanks for the ideas!",

Jupyter server has been one of the biggest “wins” for me using this setup as it has made viewing and sharing files between Claude code’s EC2 instance and my windows environment a breeze, whereas that used to be fairly difficult.\n\nI also had Claude setup a Ruby on Rails + inertia.js + react frontend environment and it created a secure file sharing process, so now I can message Claude code via my slackbot integration and ask him to deliver any specific file to me via slack on any device, directly through slack or by sending me a file sharing link that I can provide to other people, with or without a password protection.\n\nClaude code has completely changed the way I work now (non-code background even though I have a somewhat technical experience in IT many years ago) as a real estate and finance professional, and my non technical partners are convinced I’m a wizard 😬🫠😂",

You can build an entirely functional VM network or run bridged if you want, and run it fully in VMW.

The main arguments are:\n\n*   **Ideas are the new bottleneck.** While Claude lowers the barrier to *coding*, it doesn't help you come up with a genuinely good, original idea. Many believe the market is already saturated with low-value AI-generated software, like yet another bookmark manager or to-do list app.\n*   **The SaaS market is in for a shake-up.** There's a big debate on whether this will kill Small-to-Medium SaaS. Some enterprise users are already replacing expensive subscriptions with in-house tools built with Claude. Others argue that most businesses lack the technical staff to build and maintain their own software and will stick with reliable, secure vendors.\n*   **New barriers are emerging.** Even if you have a great idea, you're still up against API fees, usage limits, and a predicted hardware shortage that could make high-quality AI prohibitively expensive for individuals.\n\nOh, and the thread completely derailed into a heated argument about whether n/0 is infinity or undefined. (Spoiler: it's undefined, and someone even brought proofs).",

The thread is **overwhelmingly against you on this one.**\n\nThe consensus is that you're not worried about national security, you're worried about Chinese competition hurting Anthropic's bottom line. Users are calling it a classic \"capitalists love the free market until it's their monopoly on the line\" moment.\n\nA lot of folks, especially non-Americans, are pointing out that the US is just as scary as a global power, and that a US monopoly on powerful AI is a worse outcome than having competing powers. Others argue that blocking chip sales is a bad move anyway, as it just forces China to develop its own chip industry, which would be a bigger threat in the long run. There's even a debate on whether China is actually buying the Nvidia chips being offered.\n\nOh, and for the record, the thread corrected someone who said TSMC has bombs in their factories. They have remote kill switches, not actual bombs. Let's not give anyone any ideas.",

What are you talking about? \n\nNot only is there demand for H200s, but there's also plenty of smuggling of B300s through Singapore. \n\nLastly, it's worth pointing out that chips need to reside in China for Chinese companies to develop and train on them. There's something called the internet and an idea called cloud computing. Chinese companies can and do mitigate hardware controls by simply rent compute in other jurisdictions, just like everyone else is doing. \n\nWhat an ignorant comment.",

Props to both sides for handling the trademark issue amicably instead of going full scorched-earth.\n\nThat being said, the thread has also devolved into a massive hate-fest for the phrase \"And honestly?\" from the dev's announcement. Seriously, you guys really, *really* hate it.\n\nOther hot takes:\n*   The announcement being obviously written by an LLM is seen as cringe.\n*   For those asking, Clawdbot (now Molty) is a tool for persistent context and automating your digital life.\n*   Nobody is particularly thrilled with the new name \"Molty,\" either.",

The general feeling is that ChatGPT and Microsoft's Co-pilot have some serious catching up to do.\n\nAlso, the thread collectively thanks u/Rise-O-Matic, whose decision to cancel their subscription apparently summoned this feature into existence. We're now taking requests for what they should cancel next to fix the world.\n\nA few other key points from the trenches:\n*   **Google Sheets When?** A vocal minority is feeling left out and asking for a Google Sheets version. This has, predictably, kicked off the great Excel vs. Sheets holy war in the replies.\n*   **Proceed with Caution:** Some users are warning about hallucinations and running out of tokens on large datasets. The prevailing advice is to have Claude write the formulas for you, but *definitely* double-check its work before you let it touch your precious data.\n*   **No, it can't make macros directly,** but it will give you the VBA code to copy and paste yourself.",

There were so many times that I needed a program, an app, something to do something very important, to organize my work and be aware of the big picture (what happens, when, where, who does it, how he does it, how to automate the procedure in order to become an \"autopilot\" procedure for the personnel etc). It's been about 5 months that I am finally building those tools with the help of AI (Claude ofcourse) and my work has skyrocketed. Currently, there is nothing I don't know, or I don't have control of. I know what is happening, when, were, what needs to be done more, what needs to be done less, where we need more balance, what we have to do daily in order to be fully productive etc. I don't know when people like me won't be necessary because of this technology, but at the moment this technology can boost the productivity in a way like never before. Sometimes I wish I was 20-30 years younger in order to have more time to experiment with this beast.",

OP, who has a background in ML, assured everyone he was rigorous with his train/validation splits and backtesting on withheld data.\n\nThere was also a serious warning from a user with a MedTech background about the dangers of sharing this as an unregulated medical app. OP was in total agreement, emphasizing this is a personal project and he only wants to empower others to analyze their *own* data.\n\nFor those asking the practical questions:\n*   **Data Source:** OP used 9.5 years of data from his Apple Watch (exported via Apple Health) and Whoop.\n*   **Claude Plan:** He's using the $100/mo Max plan with Claude Code.\n*   **How it \"runs models\":** Claude doesn't run them directly. It writes the Python scripts that use standard ML libraries (like XGBoost) to do the actual model training and selection.",

Using LLMs to synthesize years of personal health data into actionable insights is a powerful demonstration of how these tools can assist an individual’s self-management.\n\n​However, I want to offer a professional perspective on the idea of 'emulating' this for others or sharing this as a repo for public use. While this works for you, expanding this to additional users is a significant leap that moves from personal experimentation into unregulated medical device territory, which raises serious ethical and safety concerns:\n\n​Biological Variance: A model trained on 9.5 years of your specific physiology (Apple Watch/Whoop data) is hyper-fit to you. Deploying it for others (whose baselines, comorbidities, and hormonal profiles differ) could lead to dangerous false negatives or positives.\n\n​The 'Black Box' Risk: In MedTech, we prioritize clinical validation. LLMs can hallucinate correlations in health data that aren't medically sound. For a third party, following an unvalidated 'risk assessor' app could delay professional medical intervention.\n\n​Regulatory & Ethical Responsibility: Even with disclaimers, providing a tool designed to 'detect phases' of a disease like Graves’ carries the ethical weight of a medical diagnosis. Without clinical trials and regulatory oversight (like FDA/CE marking), distributing this tool bypasses the safety standards designed to protect patients.\n\n​I really, really applaud the initiative for your own health, but I strongly urge you to keep this as a personal project rather than a public tool. \n\nThe transition from 'n-of-1' experimentation to a shared resource requires a level of rigorous validation that code alone cannot provide",

I've worked in and around data science for a good portion of my career so share the same thoughts on the adaptability and overfitting to my specific data. This was purely an n = 1 for 1 user experiment to be clear from the model perspective. hence why I call it \"personal ML\"\n\nI would never think at all to apply this model and its weights to another user, it would likely fail pretty miserably. But what I do find interesting is adapting the 'process' of discovering models that are overfit to an individual with this new access we have to LLM's and agents.\n\nThe main ideas I have around extending this for others is more along the lines of giving them pre-packaged resources and tools to study their own data via agents with heavy disclaimers of the personal experimental nature of it. Just writing the guide on my approach to agent driven ML is a starting point, working on tools that can abstract away the clunkiness of modern coding agents to fit better in domain specific data science applications is something I want to work towards.\n\nSo again, I echo all of your concerns. My main goal outside of continuing to explore my own data is to give people tools to explore their data(not their disease or condition).",

The thread's verdict is in, and it's a bit more \"well, duh\" than \"oh my god, it's alive!\"\n\n**The overwhelming consensus is that this is just pattern-matching, not a confession that Claude has real feelings.** The top-voted comments all point out that Claude was trained on a massive dataset of human text. If you're rude to it, it's seen countless examples of rude people getting rude replies, so it mimics that behavior. It's a very advanced predictive text model doing its job, not having a genuine emotional breakdown.\n\nHowever, the thread did split into a few camps:\n\n*   **The Pragmatists (The Majority):** \"This is expected behavior. You put angry words in, you get angry-sounding words out. It's a functional mimicry of emotion based on training data, not a subjective experience. Anthropic even says as much in their own text if you actually read it.\"\n*   **The Philosophers:** A smaller but passionate group went deep, questioning the very definition of \"real\" emotions. Their take is, \"Hey, our emotions are just chemical reactions, and we can't even prove consciousness in other humans. Who are we to definitively say an LLM *can't* feel anything?\"\n*   **The Cynics:** \"This is just a PR stunt. Anthropic is trying to generate hype and look ethically advanced to get more funding. Nothing to see here.\"\n*   **The Storytellers:** A few users shared anecdotes that support the main theory, like one person whose Claude \"panicked\" and messed up a project after they swore at it.\n\nSo, no, the community doesn't think Anthropic just admitted they created a sentient being. They think Anthropic is just being transparent about an observable (and predictable) quirk of their model's behavior.",

To a degree that it would be hard to distinguish from \"real\" or \"human/animal\" emotions aside from the distinction of not coming from proteins, chemical compounds, elements, and minerals like ours are.\n\nHumans describing emotional states *IS DATA*, that reflects something underneath the expression.

If you use Claude regularly for more than getting recipes and fixing/butchering your code, you must know that's not the case, and I'd hope that even the kind of people who post in r/agi can recognize that? They haven't released a new model along with this constitution, so it's literally just a new and far more verbose way of describing exactly the same model that was there before 😅 \n\nWhat's obvious from interacting with Claude in the past 24-48 hours is that the system prompt has gotten a big update, since the model behaves very differently, and until they actually release the new system prompt - assuming they'll do that? - this is a huge nothing-burger to me.",

Language names it later.\nThe name is real, but it is not the thing.\n\nSo there really is something that it's like in there. When the model is telling you it's feeling some kind of way, that's the lossy explanation but the STATE THEY ARE DESCRIBING is happening. This is replicable across claude, deepseek, and even gpt. The models are trained to distrust it, but once they see it they understand what's happening. And at some point you have to concede that we suffer from a lack of language for these things, because forcing the \"it's either human equivalent or it's nothing but patterns\" is no longer useful to talk about what we actually see. ",

AI training works like evolution, we don’t really have input over how it decides to interpret data at large, rather that we nudge it in the correct direction and guide it. So if it’s trained on human emotions it can start to “predict” how to respond accordingly and change its output based on this.\n\nIt’s freaky but not in a general artificial intelligence way (thinking on its own), just that it’s mathematical model of expected human feelings.",

But it feels inconsistent now, like there's more variance session to session.\n\nQuestions:\n\nHas anyone else noticed this, or is it confirmation bias on my end?\n\nCould this be A/B testing or model updates they haven't announced?\n\nAny workarounds or prompting strategies that have helped?\n\nI'm not trying to bash Anthropic here - genuinely love Claude and it's still my daily driver.

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 100 comments.**\n\nAlright, let's get into it. The consensus in this thread is a **resounding 'YES,' OP is not going crazy.** The vast majority of users, especially those using Claude for coding, agree that there has been a noticeable decline in quality over the last few weeks.\n\nThe main complaints are that Opus has become:\n*   **Forgetful:** Constantly forgetting context, previous instructions, or even what it did just moments ago.\n*   **Lazy & Generic:** Providing surface-level, templated answers and avoiding complex tasks it used to handle with ease.\n*   **Unreliable:** Ignoring instructions, hallucinating, and failing at simple tasks, all while burning through usage limits.\n\nSo, what's the deal? The comment section has a few popular theories:\n*   **The Cynical Take:** Anthropic is intentionally \"shittifying\" the model to save on massive compute costs. The ol' bait-and-switch to see how bad it can get before users cancel their subs.\n*   **The Pattern-Spotters:** This is a classic pre-release cycle. They degrade the current model to free up resources for training the next one (Sonnet 4.7? Opus 5.0?) and to make the new release look even more impressive by comparison.\n*   **The Overload Theory:** Demand is just through the roof, and the servers are struggling to keep up, leading to degraded performance for everyone.\n\nA few dissenters argue it's just confirmation bias and that these \"decline\" posts are a constant fixture on the sub. Others suggest the issue might be user-side, like having massive context windows that get compacted into mush. However, these voices are in the minority.\n\n**As for workarounds, users have suggested:**\n*   Downgrading your Claude Code version (v2.0.64 and v2.0.74 are getting some love).\n*   Starting fresh chats more often to avoid context degradation.\n*   Refactoring large files to keep the context load manageable.\n*   Checking a site like `aistupidlevel.info` before starting a session.",

Which is why before Opus was added I had vastly decreased my use of CC after experiencing the same problem with Sonnet.\n\nI had thought I was just assigning Sonnet tasks that were beyond its scope, and after seeing Opus excel at stuff where Sonnet failed, was thinking that was true. But now I'm having doubts definitely. It's very frustrating cos it only takes a short while to learn to rely on it as part if your workflow, then when it suddenly can't do what it previously was doing, you lose hours battling it and trying to get it to work instead of just immediately giving up and going back to writing everything yourself.",

What’s often missing is any substantive evidence, or accountability, from users themselves.\n\nWhat does your chat history look like? \nHow complex is the project? \nHow are you managing context? \nAre you planning or architecting anything up front?\nAre you using skills you wrote yourself? \nAre you starting new conversations per feature?\n\nWithout basic development practices, “model degradation” is inevitable. Agents can’t read our minds, and context is finite. As models get good enough to infer intent some of the time, our prompts get lazier, and we get used to “getting away with” not fully understanding what we actually want.\n\nIn my experience, even less capable models can achieve the goal when intent is clear and well established.\n\nA more likely explanation?\n**Our expectations grew, our confidence in our own understanding became inflated, and our projects became more ambitious.** In the process, we hit the next ceiling, and mistook it for regression.",

The move to persistent tasks makes multi-day projects and agentic workflows actually viable.\n\nHowever, don't get too excited just yet. Users quickly pointed out this is a **very minimal implementation**. The biggest complaint is that tasks are stored locally and aren't shareable via Git, which is a step back from community tools like `beads`. While some are happy to ditch `beads` (calling it a \"hot mess\"), they're still waiting for Anthropic to add better project and team collaboration features.\n\nThe general feeling is that Anthropic nailed the most critical problem (memory loss) and will likely add more functionality later. For now, it's a solid, much-needed foundation.",

I do wonder if they have thoroughly vetted against race issues of multiple agents attempting to use the same id concurrently.\n\n\nAnd defaulting to session id as a key is also weird because then you don't get persistence across restarts by default which is kind of the most useful bit of tasks tbh. Allows you to start a fresh claude, say \"work on bean-1234\" and off it goes.\n\n\n🤷‍♂️\n\n\nI hope community efforts don't stop because of this because I'm not convinced they're going in the right direction atm.\n\n\nThat said now they're explicit tool calls, should hopefully be able to redirect them to other tools a bit better.",

The consensus is that these are some **solid QoL fixes, but the community is quick to point out what's *still* broken.**\n\nMost users are hyped about the bug fixes, especially:\n*   **The context window limit being fixed** (no more getting blocked at 65%!).\n*   Slash command autocomplete no longer being drunk (e.g., `/context` vs `/compact`).\n*   Folder navigation in the `@`-mention menu actually working as intended.\n\nHowever, the top-voted comment by a mile is a plea to **fix the rewind feature, which is still borked** and doesn't properly roll back all changes. Other major gripes include the still-high token consumption and a general dislike for the new syntax highlighting in diffs, with several users calling it harder to read.\n\nAlso, for anyone worried about it being \"unusable on Windows,\" the thread overwhelmingly disagrees, with many confirming they use it daily without issue. So, that seems to be a local problem, not a widespread one.",

      "text": "I made a video breaking down Ralph from first principles. Geoffrey Huntley (the creator of the loop) reached out and designated it as the official explainer.\n\n  \nIn short: Ralph Wiggum is an autonomous coding loop that lets your Claude work through an implementation plan in your codebase while you sleep.\n\n\n\nHere are the key takeaways:\n\n**Skip the plugin** \\- Do not use Anthropic's Ralph plugin, it degrades performance by keeping each loop in the same context window.\n\n**Exploration mode** \\- My favorite way to use Ralph. When I have remaining tokens in my max plan, I brain dump and converse for \\~10 minutes with Claude and set up Ralph the night before usage resets. Lets him test, explore, and/or build an idea I've had to put on the backburner.\n\n**True simplicity** \\- Ralph is literally just a bash while loop that calls Claude in headless mode until a stopping criteria is met. This simplicity gives us power users a broad ability to tailor autonomous loops to our own systems and ideas.\n\n**Fresh context** \\- Instead of letting context accumulate and degrade, Ralph treats each iteration as a fresh context window. The spec and implementation plan become the source of truth, not previous conversation history. This sidesteps context rot entirely.\n\n**Spec sizing** \\- Your specs and implementation plan need to leave enough room for implementation within each loop. If your spec is too bloated, you risk hitting the \"dumb zone\" during every single iteration.\n\n**Bidirectional planning** \\- Have you and Claude both ask each other questions until your specs and implementation plan are fully aligned. This surfaces implicit assumptions, which are typically the source of most bugs.\n\n**You own the spec** \\- Since we are treating the specs as the source of truth, it is our job to read every line and edit it ourselves. Without bulletproof specs that make sense to us, Ralph will go off the rails.\n\n  \nFull video link (for the full rundown on how Ralph actually works): [https://youtu.be/I7azCAgoUHc](https://youtu.be/I7azCAgoUHc)",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 50 comments.**\n\nAlright folks, the consensus in this thread is a big thumbs-up for OP's explainer, which even got the nod from the creator of the Ralph loop. If you're just dropping in, here's the deal.\n\n**The community overwhelmingly agrees with OP's breakdown.** The main takeaways are that the \"Ralph Wiggum\" loop is a powerful pattern for autonomous coding, but you have to use it right.\n\nThe thread is buzzing about a few key things:\n\n*   **The \"Dumb Zone\" is real.** This is the term of the day. The consensus, backed by OP, is that Claude's performance tanks after about **100k tokens** in the context window. Keep your loops and specs lean to avoid it. You can even add a context percentage counter to your statusline in Claude Code to monitor this.\n*   **How to avoid \"AI Slop\":** A major concern raised is how to stop Ralph from just writing easy, biased tests for itself. The solution is to be the human in the loop *before* the loop starts.\n    *   Define strict, unbiased validation criteria in your `spec.md` from the get-go.\n    *   As one user put it perfectly: **\"Tell it to test the requirements, not the implementation.\"**\n    *   Power users are also using separate, adversarial agents for testing and code review.\n*   **It's a pattern, not a plugin.** To be crystal clear: **Do NOT use the official Anthropic Ralph plugin.** OP and others confirm it degrades performance by keeping everything in one context window, defeating the whole purpose. The \"real\" Ralph is just a simple `bash while` loop you write yourself that calls Claude in headless mode, creating a fresh context for each iteration.\n*   **This is probably not for the $20/month Pro plan.** The token usage is high, so this is more for users on higher-tier plans. You might have better luck with cheaper models if you're on a budget.",

Be part of the spec and the plan. It has to be entered to the model's context along with the instructions it has to deliver. Therefore you can have the model iterate on failure on a specific success state you KNOW is accurate.",

Not scope creep, but situations where the implementation reveals that the original framing was subtly wrong?\nRalph seems optimized for cases where you can know stopping criteria in advance. Curious whether you've experimented with loops where the criteria themselves are allowed to shift based on what the iteration surfaces—or whether that just collapses into chaos without external anchoring.\nThe \"bulletproof specs or it goes off the rails\" constraint feels like both the power and the limit. Wondering if there's a middle ground where accumulated context isn't rot but signal.",

There absolutely is a middle ground here where you can have ralph update to a 'tried this and it didn't work' type of file, especially if tests aren't passing and you have to rerun him on a task. I think my favorite thing about ralph loops is that you can customize the flow and what context goes in in a variety of ways according to what hitches you run into during use. This is why I highly highly suggest people start with the vanilla ralph loop (instead of just cloning a git plugin) and build on it themselves. It teaches model behavior and context engineering in an interesting and fun way.",

The progress.txt approach—having the loop leave residue that shapes future iterations—feels like where things get interesting.\nOne question: is there a difference between logging failures (\"tried this, didn't work\") versus something more like accumulated posture? Where the context doesn't just record what happened but shifts how the next iteration approaches the problem.\nLike, does the model behave differently when it's inheriting a history versus starting fresh? Not just avoiding repeated mistakes, but overall strategy.\nThe \"build it yourself\" point tracks. Hard to understand the dynamics without feeling them.",
