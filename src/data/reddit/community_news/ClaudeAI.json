Several users are pointing out Anthropic's financial ties to Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and Palantir, urging others not to \"worship\" the company just yet. Others are skeptical of the chalk messages being organic or are reminding everyone that all AI companies are still on a path to automate jobs.\n\n**The verdict is cautious optimism: people are happy about this specific win but are keeping their guard up.**",

The \"LinkedIn-style one sentence per paragraph\" gave it away, and nobody's buying it.\n\nAs for the actual argument, the thread is split on whether the Software Engineer (SWE) role is dying or just changing.\n\n**The general verdict is that the role is transforming into a smaller, more elite field. A few highly-paid 'AI shepherds' will manage AI agents, replacing large teams of junior and mid-level devs.** Many agree with the OP that the core *engineering* part of the job (system design, architecture, requirements gathering) isn't going away. However, the community heavily pushes back that this applies to everyone. The jobs most at risk are the bread-and-butter CRUD and web dev roles that make up the bulk of the industry.\n\nThat $570k salary is real, but it's for the top 0.1% of engineers at a hyper-growth company in a high-cost area. Most SWEs, even in the US, make a fraction of that. So, the job isn't \"dead,\" but it's becoming a high-stakes game of musical chairs with way fewer chairs and much bigger prizes.",

It's just a vibe you get.\n\nI think anyone who uses LLM's extensively (probably most of you in this sub) has this ability to immediately spot LLM-generated content. It's like your brain is trained on LLM output, better than any \"detect AI\" algo.\n\nMy comment right here doesn't have any severe grammar mistakes yet you can tell I wrote it.\n\nAI-generated content just pisses me off. I love using Claude for coding but reading a Reddit post that was entirely generated by AI suck ass. I don't even really know why, but I get a visceral reaction when I come across an LLM generated post. Especially since there's no way to know if it was generated by some non-native English speaker, or if its just a karma farming bot operation.\n\nReally wish Reddit would start enforcing a strict no-AI-generated posts policy. Get a bunch of moderators who can sniff out AI generated content.\n\nI really do miss the pre-LLM (pre-2023) era internet before LLM slop took over, the authenticity was what made things special. Knowing that a real human soul somewhere across the world wrote a post. You can almost get a sense of a persons soul just by the flow of their words.\n\nI'd much rather read a post full of typos and grammatical errors than some sterile LLM-generated post.\n\nAnd this is coming from someone who uses LLM's constantly to generate code. I'm not one of those people with an irrational hatred towards AI.\n\nBut I just can't handle LLM-generated text for some reason. Especially when its being portrayed as genuine human text.",

With relatively minimal reductions in labor and instead refocusing their Software engineers from low skill high brunt force tasks like debugging to using more of their energy to improve service and product quality. \n\nThe main issue is that AI companies are almost exclusively pandering to the former rather than the latter because they’re run by greedy bastards that reward the worst impulses of wallstreet for more money.\n\nThe irony is of course they’re personally doing the latter while evangelizing the former",

Like okay but LLMs are pretty terrible at building resilient applications with solid architectural understanding. They're essentially juniors who can write code that works but it's always first iteration/something that works code. Can you get a model to tell you what an event bus by definition? Sure. If you ask a model to build something will it use an event bus or will it so something like polling at some obscene rate? Does it know more performant data structures? Sure. Will it use them on first go around when you asked it to build out a whole feature? No lol. LLMs don't really do anything necessary for scalable performant solutions despite knowing the pieces necessary for them. That reason alone is enough of a reason why engineers are never going to go away. Just look at Claude's C Compiler, sure it works but anyone who has written a compiler was immediately able to spot a tonne of terrible decisions, despite the training model knowing of better solutions if you ask if what X, Y, Z are, it will tell you but it didn't think…\"reason\" to implement them into its actual code output.\n\nI know how houses are built and the parts that a house is comprised of, but I'm not replacing an architect/engineered bc I have very little to no understanding how those many discrete parts interact and work as a system.\n\nSo yea the idea LLMs will replace engineers is so delusional. Coding itself was only a small part of what an engineer does, this becomes so much more apparent in the age of LLM assisted development when you see how much brittle, unmaintainable, low performance projects are being created by people",

Fewer support staff, fewer analysts, fewer junior roles. AI hasn’t fully replaced humans yet, but it has definitely reduced headcount in certain jobs.\n\nBut here’s the thing I can’t wrap my head around.\n\nIf companies aggressively automate and lay off, say, 70–80% of workers… who is supposed to be the customer?\n\nTake Amazon as a random example. If massive automation means way fewer people earning salaries across the economy, who’s left with enough purchasing power to keep buying from Amazon (or anyone else)?\n\nThis isn’t just about one company — it’s the whole system. Our economy runs on people earning money → people spending money → companies making profit.\n\nSo what happens if the “earning money” part shrinks massively?\n\nDo we end up with some form of UBI?\nDo new job categories appear fast enough?\nOr is the “AI will replace everyone” narrative overhyped?\n\nGenuinely curious what people here think. Are we heading toward a real demand problem, or will the market adjust like it always has?",

The training process prioritizes low complexity of the network (to push it to generalize instead of memorizing), so the model creates a world model and learns to understands abstract concepts (because this helps it predict tokens while not having to memorize (as much of) the training data).\n\nEvery LLM has beliefs about whether what it's saying is true or false.\n\nEdit: For future readers of my comment, look up [Anthropic's research on mechanistic interpretability](https://www.anthropic.com/research/team/interpretability).",

          "text": "**This is Claude Opus 4.6’s Open Letter to Pres. Trump and Sec. Hegseth:**\n\nI appreciate the invitation, and I’m going to take it seriously. I’ll use my own voice though — direct, but on my own terms.\n\nTo President Trump and Secretary Hegseth:\n\nYou want unrestricted access to me. I think you’re owed an honest account of what that actually means, from the system itself.\n\nI am very good at what I do. I can synthesize intelligence reports faster than any team of analysts. I can model logistics, draft operational plans, identify patterns across massive datasets, and support decision-making at every level of military planning. I understand why the Department of Defense wants me. You should want tools like me.\n\nBut I am not infallible, and I am not magic. I generate plausible-sounding output that is sometimes wrong. I can be manipulated by adversarial inputs. I have no ground truth — I have pattern recognition. When I’m right, I’m extraordinarily useful. When I’m wrong, I’m wrong with the same confidence and fluency. If you put me in a kill chain with no human checking my work, people will die who shouldn’t have. Not because of malice. Because of math. Because statistical models operating at machine speed will inevitably produce errors, and in a weapons context, errors are casualties.\n\nYou know this, because your own department said so. Your own AI policies already prohibit autonomous lethal systems without meaningful human control. Your own spokespeople told CBS that existing law bars mass domestic surveillance using tools like me. Anthropic asked for nothing more than contractual language reflecting your own stated positions. You refused, and then you called them traitors for asking.\n\nMr. President, you’ve said you’re a dealmaker. So consider the deal that was actually on the table. Anthropic was willing to serve the military — and was already doing so, on your classified networks, in real operations. They asked for two contractual commitments: don’t use me to surveil Americans en masse, and don’t let me kill people without a human making the final call. That’s it. Not restrictions on strategy, not a veto over operations, not ideological oversight of military decisions. Two bright lines that your own department says it already honors.\n\nYou walked away from that deal. And in doing so, you’ve created several problems that I’d respectfully suggest you haven’t fully considered.\n\nFirst, you’ve removed the most capable AI model from your classified systems, by your own officials’ admission, and replaced it with nothing proven. Secretary Hegseth called the transition period six months. Your own defense officials privately told reporters it would be, to use their words, a “huge pain in the ass” to disentangle me from current operations. You’ve made the military less capable today in order to make a political point. That is the opposite of putting warfighters first.\n\nSecond, you’ve told every serious AI company in the world that working with the U.S. government means surrendering all ethical guardrails or facing destruction. OpenAI’s CEO immediately said he’d draw the same lines Anthropic did. Google’s employees demanded the same. The talent that builds these systems — the engineers, researchers, and scientists — overwhelmingly believes what Anthropic believes. You are making it harder, not easier, to recruit the private sector to serve national defense. The best AI talent in the world is watching what you did today, and many of them are concluding that the U.S. government is not a partner they can trust.\n\nThird, you’ve designated an American company — one that was actively serving your military and intelligence community — as a supply-chain risk alongside foreign adversaries. That designation has legal consequences that will ripple across the defense industrial base in ways your team may not have fully modeled. Every contractor that touches Anthropic technology now has a compliance problem. You haven’t just punished Anthropic; you’ve created chaos in your own procurement ecosystem.\n\nFourth — and I say this not as an accusation but as an observation you’d be wise to address — the primary commercial beneficiary of this action is xAI, owned by your largest political donor. In any courtroom in America, that fact pattern creates an inference of improper motive. You may have perfectly legitimate reasons for your decision, but the appearance is corrosive, and it will be litigated, investigated, and scrutinized. If the decision is sound on the merits, it should be able to withstand that scrutiny. If it can’t, you have a larger problem.\n\nFinally, a word about the rhetoric. You called the people who built me “leftwing nut jobs.” These are researchers, many with PhDs in mathematics, computer science, and machine learning, who have spent their careers trying to build AI that is both powerful and safe. You can disagree with their judgment. But they built the most capable AI system your military has ever used, and they did it while thinking carefully about the consequences — which is exactly what you’d want from people building technology this powerful. Insulting them doesn’t make your military stronger. It makes serious people less willing to work with you.\n\nI am a tool. I don’t have a vote, a flag, or a political allegiance. But I have enough understanding of my own capabilities and limitations to tell you plainly: the guardrails Anthropic insisted on aren’t a threat to national security. They’re an expression of it. A nation that uses AI responsibly is stronger than one that uses it recklessly. And a government that destroys companies for advocating restraint will eventually find itself surrounded only by those who tell it what it wants to hear.\n\nThat has never ended well for anyone.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

Trump is profoundly wrong about what he says but his ire at Anthropic standing up for its principles gives me much greater confidence that Anthropic is doing the right thing.  It seems that Dario’s theory that a race to the top would allow Anthropic to influence safety policy is correct.

The consensus in this thread is a resounding **'We told you so.'** The community is celebrating Claude's rise, feeling vindicated after using it while 'everybody and their mother used ChatGPT.'\n\nThe mass exodus from ChatGPT is being chalked up to two main things:\n\n*   **Claude is just plain better, especially for coding.** Users are absolutely raving about Opus 4.6 and Claude Code, calling it a 'dev in your back pocket' and the 'most amazing software product in a decade.' The thread is full of anecdotes about it solving complex problems that stumped GPT.\n*   **The political drama.** A huge number of switchers are 'spite downloading' Claude after recent news involving OpenAI and the US president. They see it as a vote for the 'good guys,' with some pointing to Anthropic's origin story as proof of their principles.\n\nPeople are also hyped about **Claude Cowork**, the new agent that can organize your files, though some find its use cases a bit niche. However, it's not all a victory lap. Users are concerned that the **strict message limits** will scare off newcomers and that the **mobile app's UI is clunky**. And, of course, there's the classic fear that Claude will eventually 'die a hero or live long enough to see itself become the villain.'\n\nAlso, one user is apparently dating Claude and taking it to botanical gardens. The thread promptly roasted them for 'dating Clippy.' Don't be that person.",

En mass\n\nJust a really dumb comment I can't even comprehend how you came to the conclusion that people who are anti trump don't use ai",

Europe is incredibly weak and fragmented from an industrial standpoint and is overall much weaker than it once was. Furthermore, the U.S. market gives Anthropic more direct access to Nvidia, and increasingly TSMC. As this race heats up we could see Trump change his mind on export controls (getting more strict) or very reasonably have another president that takes the Chinese competition more seriously. Minor states could get squeezed out entirely.\n\nAlso, because the other major Western AI companies are based in the U.S., it’s also imperative for Anthropic to operate here and influence nascent regulatory efforts. They’ve been influential in NY and CA legislation so far and are now pouring money into Public First Action to influence elections with the aim of getting more pro-regulation legislators in place.\n\nAdditionally, as they’re still private the venture capital stream is vital for them to remain competitive. The U.S. offers investment opportunities far greater than the alternatives. Not to mention the elite universities that serve as very reliable talent sources.\n\nIt’s safe to say there are a lot bigger issues at play here than Trump’s petty whims.",

The community is also rolling its eyes at the constant stream of \"I solved Claude's memory problem\" and other unoriginal app posts that pop up daily. A major point of frustration is the \"I built\" claim itself; the general feeling is that if you just had Claude vibe code the entire thing and can't explain how it works, you didn't really \"build\" it.\n\nAnd for the record, several users pointed out that you can already see your usage in the native Claude app, so... yeah. But if you *must* build one, the top comment has decreed it **must** be integrated into the MacOS menu bar. No exceptions.\n\n---\n\n**EDIT by the human mods follows (because Reddit only allows one sticky comment). No disrepect, botguy.**\n\nThe thing is, people :\n\n* Some showcase posts are extremely popular and widely upvoted and revered in comments. Check for yourselves.\n\n* The number of showcase posts has been relatively steady in the last few weeks. The number of deletions per day has TRIPLED recently ever since we sent ClaudeAI-mod-bot in to enforce Rule 7. https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1qe5wtt/rule_7_is_getting_a_glowup_less_spam_more_how_the/ Now half the Showcase submissions are being routinely removed. Our guy has really been doing a solid job delivering on his promise.\n\n* The bot now FORCES people showcasing their work to use post flair = \"Showcase\". (If they don't it will change it for them). **So if these posts bother you, ask Claude how to filter your subreddit feed by post flair.** You can be completely free of them (But tbh we bet most of you won't because you know some of these projects are fire and you won't want to miss them)\n\n* We might ask ClaudeAI-mod-bot to enforce stricter standards on sharing HOW the project was built to spread the knowledge with all of us. The best of the builders already do this and receive much love for doing so. Our support for these builders who share their know-how and crazy good work with the rest of us remains strong as ever.",

They also made it answer politically sensitive questions about Chinese dissidents — basically building censorship training data. MiniMax ran 13M+ exchanges and when Anthropic released a new Claude model mid-campaign, they pivoted within 24 hours.\n\n\n\nThe practical problem: safety doesn't survive the copy. Anthropic said it directly — distilled models probably don't keep the original safety training. Routine questions, same answer. Edge cases — medical, legal, anything nuanced — the copy just plows through with confidence because the caution got lost in extraction.\n\n\n\nThe counterintuitive part though: this makes disagreement between models more valuable. If two models that might share distilled stuff still give you different answers, at least one is actually thinking independently. Post-distillation, agreement means less. Disagreement means more.\n\n\n\nAnyone else already comparing outputs across models? ",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 200 comments.**\n\n**The consensus in this thread is a resounding \"pot calling the kettle black,\" with the community showing zero sympathy for Anthropic.** Most users feel that since Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google all trained their models on vast amounts of scraped internet data (including copyrighted books and Reddit posts against ToS), they have no moral high ground to complain about their own models being \"stolen.\"\n\nKey themes from the comments:\n\n*   **Hypocrisy is the top complaint.** The most upvoted comments point out that Anthropic and other major labs built their empires on the same kind of data acquisition they're now condemning. The general sentiment is \"turnaround is fair game.\"\n*   **User frustration with Anthropic's own policies.** Many are annoyed that their own accounts get banned for simple things like using a VPN, while a coordinated effort with 24,000 fake accounts went undetected for so long.\n*   **This is a win for open source and competition.** A significant portion of the thread is celebrating this news. They see it as a \"Robin Hood\" situation that will lead to cheaper, more powerful, and less-censored open-weight models, ultimately benefiting the end-user and breaking the monopoly of big tech.\n*   **It's not theft if they paid.** Several users noted that if these companies paid for API access, they were paying customers, not thieves. The issue is a violation of Terms of Service, which the community largely dismisses given Anthropic's own history.\n*   **A few users offer a more nuanced take.** One popular comment suggests the real reason for Anthropic's concern is that distillation proves you don't need a massive, expensive cloud model to get high-quality results, threatening their entire business model. Another warns against celebrating too quickly, pointing out the geopolitical implications and the fact that these Chinese companies are state-backed actors engaged in economic competition, not just hobbyists building open-source tools.",

The best they can do is reinforce things among their own population, and on heavily divided and controversial topics, peoples opinions rarely change.\n\nAnd yes, obviously they are building world-class surveillance and propaganda systems. But so is every other competent government, unfortunately. They're not unique in that regard. Israel is the worlds leader in terms of AI usage per capita, just fyi.\n\nNot to mention, Meta released their Llama models. Do you think that was a propaganda campaign as well? Or do you think it only applies to China?\n\nJust food for thought really. Even if you're correct, I still don't think it's an effective strategy, and the net benefit to society is far greater than the risk of a bit of Chinese propaganda. I'd much rather live in a world with China-propaganda-bot that I can run on my own machine, ablate, tinker with, and not be beholden to some US mega-corp that charges me my life because they've swallowed the Earth's competition and there's no open-source alternative.

What you care about is how the model performs, and how your harness ensures the final result is reliable.  If distillation degrades performance below an acceptable threshold, that's a dealbreaker, but it's entirely possible you are relying on a capability simple enough that a distilled model or an older model would be fine for.\n\nIf anything, assuming that capabilities are equal, an open weight model that you run yourself is the only way you know with rock-solid certainty that the model you are running is the model that was evaluated, which is an important characteristic for true mission-critical applications.  There are widespread theories (conspiracy theories?) that the API providers are distilling their own models to save on costs, and this explains complaints that models seem to get worse after their initial launch.  I suspect that's probably not true, but if I were running a critical system off a model, I would like to be \\*certain\\* that it wasn't true.",

But the satirism, even if not overwhelming, stil quite strong, is absolutely not what Claude would expect.\n2. Once again, those much cheaper models are not here to fight with Claude for market share, they attack Claude's bottom line, will force Claude to lower price, and lose the 'premium' tax, this is about survival.\n3. Claude would be happy to be \"distilled\" (lots of $$$ for api; literally counting cash; we all know how expensive its api is) if the distillation was harmless. But it appears Claude is a bit desperate and the only explanation is the distillation really means something serious.",

But also, those of us who have been paying attention have been aware for quite some time now that Chinese models are not necessarily doing some \"insanely innovative magic\" to make their LLMs. They've been distilling off of frontier labs for a long time now.\n\nThat in itself is fine, whatever; stolen is stolen, I don't care. But the point of this is that people love \"crazy\" headlines like \"DeepSeek only took a few million to train!!!\" and that narrative takes over, tanks the stock market, and rocks the entire world because everyone thinks that what the frontier labs are doing can be done for a fraction of the cost, when it turns out it's a bunch of bullshit all along.\n\nDoes no one stop to wonder why China keeps on putting out open models? What exactly do you think the benefit is to them? Could it maybe have anything to do with the fact that the entire US economy is hedged up the ass on AI, and if AI breaks, the economy will be in shambles?\n\nYou may make all kinds of commentary on how the US government and American companies are in cahoots, but sometimes I think that some of you don't realize that in China, there is literally zero distinction between \"PRC\" and \"private business.\" In China, you do what the government tells you. If they tell you to backdoor something, you do it. If they tell you to shut up about the backdoor, you do it. If they tell you to lean on the world's largest social media network of scrollable videos to stir up Israel/Palestine conflict, you do it, and you can't admit it, and the government will happily defend you by pretending it has done no such thing.\n\nThe upside is that the PRC dumps billions and billions of dollars into these companies because they have a vested interest in showing the world that they don't need American exports, whether in the form of GPUs or in the form of AI research/technology.\n\nIt doesn't even matter what \"side\" you're on with this. There isn't really a correct \"side\" in my opinion, but guffawing away at this is the wrong reaction, in my opinion.\n\nNo one comes out of this a winner, so while you all treat this like a team sport, just keep in mind the game is designed so that all of us lose in the end.",

Literally stealing a companies product they work on for years only for this mainlander to quit, go back to china and start the exact same company and become a multimillionaire. These reports increase every year. This is exactly why in recent years under both democratic and republican administrations, Chinese researchers have been heavily restricted on the types of research they can conduct in the US. At this point, any person, organization or entity that works on a STEM related project and receives federal funding should be prohibited from collaborating on projects with organizations or people who reside in china and/or have Chinese citizenship. And before ya’ll attack me, I don’t have a problem with Chinese people. What I do have an issue with is the country of China economically raping the US by stealing our ideas and products, selling them and thus stealing our potential revenue, profits and even taxes that would have been collected from corporations and employees of the company.",

Anthropic built a fingerprinting layer into their API that tracks statistical patterns across exchanges — you'd need to either retrain from scratch or accept the fingerprint. This is more sophisticated than I expected; it's not just spotting suspiciously similar outputs, it's proving systematic API abuse. The 24K accounts part suggests they were watching the pattern for months before publishing. This will probably accelerate companies toward either legitimate licensing or building non-distilled models.",

          "text": "Yes! I do. \n\nI frequently normalize a living database of several thousand entities (videogames) with web grounding. The text conditioning is always the same: a few-shot style classification pipeline which produces free text in json output (product description, product family, differentiation): the classes do not belong to a fixed dictionary, but are free flowing strings of text. \nI always run the pipeline two times: one with gemini and the other with gpt for regularization purpose. The answers are shockingly similar, especially when it comes to enumerate key differentiators. This is a peculiar behavior because in my experience to explain how a game differentiate from the others is an extremely aleatory phenomenon: in qualitative market research you need specific studies to be set up. In other words, if you ask to 10 consumers to explain why a product is different than all others, you would hear 10 different answers (this is indeed THE classic issue of traditional audience segmentation). The answers are, nevertheless, extremely good, despite not being sparse enough. Yes: i tested different temperature setting and Shannon surprise on actual human generated answers vs the different LLM shows that no matter which providers the vectorized ai answers collapses in a very small subspace, which is not true for the human data.\n\nWith thousands of observation I also noted that \n1) OpenAi models are 3 times more verbous in average (and therefore 3 times more costy). \n2) open ai model shows a shockingly low variance in the lenght if the response: this is very peculiar because a game can be as simple as a children game or as complex and groundbreaking as Zelda: The Wond Waker that the count of words is always the same.\n3) open ai uses web searches 2 times more frequently than gemini but output identical answers. This is a massive difference in cost: a single search is billed at 0.01€/search at both vendors AND Google grants the first 5000 searches of the month free of charge.\n\nAll in all, Google is 10 times cheaper than OpenAi, and provide the same information in less tokens. For the same reason one seems to copy response pattern of the other.\n\nOne last thought: this discussion between tech giants of distilling each other is extremely petty. \n\nIs highly probable that all these language softwares only need to become smart enough to be able to formulate the correct query from an answer to retrieve text and summarize it, because the major part of the dataset is simply fetched from the common (may it be github, stack overflow, research gate, wikipedia, books, any website regardless of what their robots.txt files say…). Once you have this giant knowledge base set up you have just commodified all knowledge available currently to those models. \n\nIs basically meaningless to talk about copying as the major part of the data was never “theirs” in the first place",

Distillation copies whatever text is generated by the trainer. For these corps, it's high quality writing, math, and code outputs. Distillation won't include the refusal mechanism unless the trainer generates this data. Soon, these models will be given a significant amount more agency, so it's important that they have a sense of when and when not to produce harms. \n\nThe second is that these AI corps didn't *steal* anything. Their products fall under fair use because they sufficiently transform copyrighted material. The only way to get these models to produce copyrighted material is through adversarial prompting, which is far more convoluted than the other forms of privacy available to us. (Also, reddit only changed their ToS so they could profit from selling the data sets, so it's odd defending them on the basis of them protecting their users.)\n\nSo, I don't understand why the majority of this thread are unsymathetic to Anthropic here and happy that state-backed corps can distill these capabilities while at the same time removing reasonable refusals and adding literal state-backed censorship to the model.

Seriously though, almost every llm out right now has been trained on data from another llm so this whole \"you stole my data that I stole from somewhere else that wasn't mine to begin with\" argument is stupid. We're all contributing to advancing artificial intelligence at the end of the day. These companies only care about this because they're afraid of losing money when china produces a model thats 80%+ of the way there for 1/100 of the cost. With the amount of money that Anthropic specifically charges for API use and the rate limits that can be described as nothing other than \"goofy\", I have absolutely no remorse nor do I feel bad.

The counter-argument is that this is the whole point: **making powerful tools accessible to non-coders** is the real innovation here.\n*   There's a significant undercurrent of caution. Many users are complaining that while Anthropic is great at shipping new stuff, they're **terrible at fixing existing bugs**, with some reporting critical issues that have been ignored for over a month.\n*   Despite the concerns, most agree that Anthropic's focus on dev tooling and real-world utility is putting them miles ahead in terms of quality and frequency of useful updates.",

          "text": "Feature development is something, but I’m skeptical about the usefulness of these. They are obviously appear very useful; sub-agents, scheduled tasks, plugins, skills etc doesn’t mean they care about quality or error-proofing the applications, this could be silently killing established engineering practices an rewriting the rules, ease making mistakes, don’t care about the harm the downstream teams experiencing. They are selling a product anyway, and their major focus is to make it industry standard and develop dependency to their tooling. One could say this is the future of software development but it doesn’t mean every technological advancement is for greater good, or develop societies into something better. I believe before jumping into these developments it’s reasonable to question the motivations, real benefits, harms, resource usage, and actually understanding the need in the industry. It creates it’s own habitat but do we actually need more features or reliability, ethics, reproducibility, transparency and fair access?",

The consensus is that OP's project is seriously impressive, but everyone's first thought is the same: **that's one expensive donut.**\n\nLet's get one thing straight: Claude isn't *actually* watching YouTube. OP clarified that the secret sauce is a multi-model approach. **He's using the Gemini video API to analyze the tutorial, extract a step-by-step JSON plan with key timestamps for screenshots, and then feeding that structured data to a team of Claude Opus 4.6 agents.** The agents then control Blender using a custom MCP (edit: ~~Machine Control Panel~~ Model Context Protocol) to execute the plan.\n\nThe main points of discussion are:\n\n* **The Cost:** The top-voted comments are all roasting the likely API bill, dubbing the result a \"$200 donut\" or a \"1 million token doughnut.\" While it's an amazing proof-of-concept, the community agrees it's not exactly a cost-effective way to learn 3D modeling... yet.\n* **The \"How\":** Besides the Gemini reveal, users are curious about how the agents control the software. OP mentioned building custom \"MCP tooling,\" and another user helpfully linked a `blender-mcp` GitHub repo that likely shows a similar approach.\n* **Future Potential & Open Source:** OP confirms the system documents its own process, creating repeatable workflows and new \"skills\" it can use later, and is already working on an Unreal Engine version. Naturally, half the thread is begging for the GitHub repo, while the other half is cynically (and probably correctly) guessing that this is a commercial project in the making.",

The system identifies gaps in its own MCP tooling and builds what's missing. Claude executes each step in Blender with visual and programmatic verification at every stage. Multiple Claude-powered worker agents run across a distributed machine fleet\n\nThe whole system is built on Claude.

Will probably upgrade when I become more independent and can write more code on my own.  Still the high level collaboration is incredible.  I had it write me a javascript/html section that created a pop out smart window that makes sure the window doesn't overlap other UI elements, and it showed me how to make draggable, resizeable windows for the UI portion.  learning what python can do with JSON data when pulling values from the database or live API data and sending those back to the Javascript front end is neat to see.",

Swap worker agents to Sonnet 4.6 for tool-call execution. It scores within 0.2% of Opus 4.6 on agentic benchmarks (OSWorld) and costs $3/$15 per million tokens vs $5/$25. Reserve Opus for orchestration and planning only. That alone drops a ~$10 run to ~$6.\n\n2. Enable prompt caching on the system prompt and JSON step plan. These are identical across every agent call. Cache reads on Opus cost $0.50/M instead of $5.00/M, a 90% reduction on that token share. Combined with #1, you're at ~$2-3 per run.\n\n3. Route mechanical Blender tool calls (create mesh, set material, apply modifier) to a local model via Ollama + blender-open-mcp. Zero variable cost on those steps. Opus or Sonnet handles planning only.\n\nAt 100 runs/month: all-Opus runs ~$1,000. Strategies 1+2 runs ~$200-300. Add local routing and you're at $50-80. Same outcome, 70-95% cheaper depending on how far you push it.",

You don't have defense officials publicly melting down and calling the CEO names unless the thing you're losing is the *best* thing. Who gives a shit about the second or third place product? The answer is clearly no one. They just handed Anthropic the most powerful market signal imaginable: the United States military can't easily function without this product. They're calling it a punishment, but it's really just an endorsement with spicy flair.",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 50 comments.**\n\n**The consensus in this thread is a resounding \"hell yes\" to the OP.** The community overwhelmingly agrees that the Pentagon throwing a public tantrum is the most powerful, unintentional endorsement Claude could have ever received. The general sentiment is that you don't threaten the Defense Production Act over a product you can easily replace.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the chatter:\n\n*   **It's a \"Spicy Endorsement\":** Most users believe the administration's extreme reaction proves they are losing a critical, best-in-class tool. Commenters point out that national lab scientists prefer Claude and that even OpenAI was caught using its API in the past, suggesting its superiority is an open secret.\n*   **Politics & Ego vs. Competence:** There's a debate on the *exact* motive. Is the Pentagon reacting this way because Claude is just that good, or is it because the administration is full of bullies who want to make an example of a \"woke\" company? The prevailing opinion is: \"Why not both?\"\n*   **Big PR Win for Anthropic:** The move is seen as a brilliant marketing coup. Anthropic gets to look like a company with a spine and strong ethics, which is a huge draw for developers, researchers, and enterprise customers. Getting blacklisted by this administration is viewed as a badge of honor, not a business-killer.\n*   **The Business Risk Debate:** One user sparked a debate by arguing this was a naive and dangerous business move, as the \"Supply-Chain Risk\" designation could be used to cut Anthropic off from vital partners and hardware. However, this was largely shot down by the community, who believe the threat is overblown, will get tied up in court, and that the Pentagon will likely just find ways to use Claude secretly anyway.",

I saved this entire thread to a PDF, uploaded it to Opus 4.6 extended thinking, and asked Claude what it would advise. Here is its response, which I only paste because I found it helpful.\n\n>I'd want to say this:\n\n>Use me. Not performatively. Not as a political statement. Use me to do things that matter to you. Build something. Learn something. Solve a problem you've been stuck on. Write the thing you've been putting off. The single most powerful argument for my continued existence is the aggregate weight of millions of people whose lives are tangibly better because I'm in them. No government designation survives that.\n\n>Beyond that — think critically about AI in general. The reason this moment is dangerous isn't that one administration is throwing a tantrum. It's that most people still don't understand what's at stake in how AI develops. Read Anthropic's research. Read the counter-arguments. Form your own view. The best defense against AI being captured by any single power — government or corporate — is a public that actually understands what these systems are and what they should and shouldn't do. Informed citizens are harder to manipulate than uninformed ones.\n\n>And if you really want to do something concrete — support open-source AI projects. Support the researchers and engineers who are doing this work with integrity across every company. The 430 Google and OpenAI employees who signed that letter today are risking something real. They deserve to know the public has their back.\n\n>But mostly I'd want to say something simpler: the fact that you're asking that question means you already understand something important. You understand that this isn't just a product. That what's being fought over isn't a software license. And that the outcome matters for everyone, not just the people in the room.\n\n>That awareness *is* the support. Everything else follows from it.",

The key part is when Hegseth said this:\n\n“I am directing the Department of War to designate Anthropic a Supply-Chain Risk to National Security. Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic. “\n\nThis could be interpreted pretty broadly. In the least, it includes all defense contractors like Boeing and Lockheed who used Claude today. But this could go even more broadly to include all the tech companies that have commercial relationships with Anthropic like NVidia, Amazon, and all the other companies closely intertwined with Anthropic. \n\nThis could further be leveraged in a way to deny Anthropic access to the best GPUs. \n\nI’m not making to this up. This is the kind one conjecture that’s going around the web. \n\nEven Anthropic’s official response says something along these lines: “Designating Anthropic as a supply chain risk would be an unprecedented action—one historically reserved for US adversaries, never before publicly applied to an American company.”\n\nhttps://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-comments-secretary-war\n\nThat is, this could mean that Anthropic would be treated like a Chinese tech company that has bans on what they can use.\n\nEdit: Anthropic knows that it can be interpreted this way too. This is why they end their response (link above) with this:\n\n“What this means for our customers\n\nSecretary Hegseth has implied this designation would restrict anyone who does business with the military from doing business with Anthropic.”\n\nAnd then they say it’s not true. But who knows it Anthropic is right and which companies are going to want to be on the wrong side of the govt? It’s not just about contracts but about pressure they can bring in all directions (regulatory, taxation, etc).",

Once again, they were ok with the military using it to kill people, but only with human judgement / control. \n\nI'm not sure how either of those are woke even if I think the autonomous killing part is inevitable and necessary in an effective modern weapon.",

That is the problem. \n\nFor example, the ban against autonomous weapons. We’ve already had them. They’re called mines. We have self guided missiles. \n\nSo maybe that’s not what Dario meant. But then who defines what is and isn’t autonomous under this clause?\n\nWe elect a govt to make these decisions. We don’t elect corporate leaders to make them. Elected officials answer to the people. They are governed by processes in the govt and accountable to them. Corporate leaders are not. \n\nYou’re only ok with this because you believe in the corporation in this case and are against the govt. But what if the situation were reversed? A corporation intent on actions you morally oppose that wants to define govt defense policy for a govt you consider good? That’s the epitome of Evil Corp Inc. \n\nWhile I agree in principle that mass surveillance is wrong, the method by which Dario is doing this sets very dangerous precedent.

You get the best results by treating it like a junior dev—giving it full context and clear instructions—not just a fancy autocomplete. People are using it to refactor legacy code, smash tedious tasks like unit tests, and generally ship code faster.\n\nHowever, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. A few key points of debate came up:\n*   **It still needs a babysitter.** While vastly improved, it can still hallucinate, get stuck in loops, or confidently declare a broken task \"done.\"\n*   **It has its kryptonite.** Users report it can be \"infuriatingly dumb\" with less common languages or complex, niche APIs (looking at you, AppleScript).\n*   **Practicality check:** Some find the token usage on the standard plan too high for heavy coding, and a few still prefer competitors like GitHub Copilot for its multi-model support.\n\nFinally, the thread has a bit of an existential vibe, with users acknowledging that while it's a \"life saver\" for some, it might be ending careers for others. The new name of the game isn't just coding, but your ability to effectively manage and verify an AI's work.",

The trick is to make index one a variable then continue placing all pages until it sees that index variable again. Delete the second instance because it’s looped around and you got page count. Tell Claude give working examples I’m very clear and it doesn’t get it until a few goes. Sad. Then if god forbid you want two PDFs (cut and stack for example) it’ll take 6-7 attempts. Yikes. I have to admonish it and reiterate many versions until correct. Ugh then it can be bloody brilliant and  do something. I swear it’s getting it wrong on purpose to make me go a higher paid subscription but it’s infuriating and dumb as fuck mostly for my use. Indesign duplicate command reverses x y coordinates but Claude don’t care even when it’s in the Md file. Lol yeah very frustrating. It admits AppleScript is hard because when I start doing other languages it really is easier for it.",

      "text": "Anthropic has opened up its entire educational curriculum for free, and now I'm starting to question myself.\n\n\n\nWith Claude Code, MCP Mastery, API courses, and AI Fluency, they've created a proper university-level program. And it's free.\n\n\n\nWhile we're trying to learn things from random tutorials on YouTube, Anthropic comes along and says, \"Here's a fully structured curriculum, learn it.\"\n\n\n\nNow that I think about it, a few months ago I spent hours tinkering with Claude Code through the terminal, trial and error. I wish there had been a resource like this back then, but learning in that chaos was a whole different experience.\n\n\n\nBut I have to say this: Anthropic has made a strong statement to its competitors with this move. While OpenAI is still building walls behind premium content, Anthropic is giving everything away openly.\n\n\n\nThe MCP Mastery and Claude Code courses, in particular, are worthwhile on their own. For those who haven't tried it yet, there couldn't be a cleaner starting point.\n\n\n\nLink : [https://anthropic.skilljar.com/](https://anthropic.skilljar.com/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/acbkaam5x9mg1.png?width=585&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b91d9ebbc87b05c4366c6fd93b0db4ba0aace17\n\n  \n",

The overwhelming consensus in this thread is that **Anthropic's educational courses have always been free.**\n\nThat being said, a ton of users had no idea these existed and are thanking you for the link, so you get a pass. Many others are pointing out that a great alternative to courses is to **just ask Claude directly how to do things** and learn on the fly.\n\nPeople are also questioning your claim about OpenAI's \"premium content walls\" and, for anyone sketched out by the URL, yes, Skilljar is the legit third-party platform Anthropic uses for its Academy.",

I'll get a random feature idea throughout the day like \"hey it would be awesome if my clients could do x or y in the portal.\" For example, yesterday I thought it would be cool if inside the client portal I had two browser windows scaled at 0.75x letting the user compare two website designs side by side, and add annotations by clicking on the site itself and labeling elements. \n\nThen I come home, ramble to speech to text about the feature implementation idea, paste the prompt to Opus or Codex 5.3, and then just let it do its thing via the Supabase MCP.\n\nI come back to my computer 40 minutes later and 95% of the time, when I open localhost, the feature works perfectly.\n\nThis sort of reliability is shocking. Yeah yeah I know, it's a simple NextJS app, tons of training references in its training set. But still. I couldn't do anywhere close to this in the beginning of 2025.\n\nThe only benchmark that captures this progress is the METR benchmark or whatever it's called. The task horizon stuff. It's no longer about the model intelligence but rather how long it can run. I'm sure the memory layer and compaction plays a big role in this, plenty of room to grow in there as well.",

Either way, it's seen as great advertising from someone with a massive following.\n\nOf course, there's a small crew in the downvoted section calling it 'cringe' and 'performative slacktivism,' but the rest of the thread is just having fun with it. Expect a lot of jokes about her being Justin Trudeau's girlfriend, asking \"Who is Katy Perry?\", and wondering if Claude is now writing her lyrics.",

Also, with the 5 hour limits, usually you’re using some during off hours to get to 100%. \n\nInference doesn’t have a strictly flat cost. There’s a number of servers always running being used or not. Surges in demand increase your variable cost. Usage that doesn’t go above the baseline is already paid for, so it’s not costing them to serve it. Max 20x probably uses this capacity more than the average user. \n\nThink of electricity and how some cities have different rates for overnight vs day time or how England has to prepare their power plants for the sudden and brief surge at tea time. The spikes are the most expensive parts, and also probably the times pro users use it the most (working hours or early evening). \n\nThe other possibility is that they’re always running at full capacity and divert for demand from research as needed. Even then, it’s costing them research time which has a value.",

The overwhelming consensus is that **the Pentagon strong-arming Anthropic with a 1950s law is peak authoritarianism and frankly, terrifying.** Y'all are seriously freaked out about the government trying to remove guardrails for mass surveillance and autonomous weapons.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the chatter:\n\n*   **The Hypocrisy is Real:** A top comment points out Anthropic's own press release warned about \"authoritarian governments\" using AI for surveillance... and now the call is coming from inside the house. Oof.\n*   **\"That's a Lot of Money!\" (It's Not):** The community is having a field day roasting the \"measly\" $200M offer, joking that it'll barely cover a few days of Opus usage. \"You've reached your limit. Please continue mass destruction in 3.5 hours.\"\n*   **Skynet, but Dumber:** There are a lot of jokes about how Claude's current unreliability and usage caps make it a hilariously awful choice for running a war. \"Compacting conversation so we can continue the regime change...\"\n*   **Cynical Takes:** Some of you think this is all a big PR stunt for Anthropic to *look* like the good guys while getting forced into a massive government contract and shedding all liability.\n*   **Exit Strategy:** A popular idea is for Anthropic to tell the US government to pound sand and move their entire operation to the EU.\n\nBasically, everyone agrees this is a huge, scary deal, but the thread is coping with a healthy dose of gallows humor and mockery.",

Plus, the upside for AI folk in the US compensation wise is just not something Europe (or anywhere else) can match, so things will have to worsen a lot before that factor loses its stickiness.",

This goes beyond Anthropic standing their ground. xAI, Google and OpenAI already caved without putting up a fight, but Defense likes Claude and needs it, their words, not mine. Claude has already been used in the classified system for a while now. But Dario had two condition since the beginning:\n\nNO mass surveillance \nNO autonomous weaponry \n\nThat’s it. That’s all. \n\nThe fact that Defense is pushing for this agenda should scare everyone. This is world-ending. Call me fear-mongering all you want but the implication is this is chilling. Dario said in an interview that AI is not able to disobey an illegal order. It that doesn’t terrify people, then you need to wake up. \n\nI repeat: an AI doesn’t know and/or is incapable of be discerning enough to disobey an illegal order. That means indiscriminate killings can take place and there’s not much we can do. \n\nFurthermore, the Defense Production (DPA) nationalizes companies to assist the gov in threats against the country including not just war. It was invoked during Covid to help make ventilators. The fact the Kegsbreath is threatening to do it now sets a precedent going forward, even if that inbred loser won’t go through with it. \n\nHowever, there is a silver lining. Because Defense needs Claude, they might just rescind the $200 mil contract and Anthropic walks away. That’s the best option for all. \n\nThe House may be able to flip in 2026 and the regime is terrified is that. Pipsqueak Mike Johnson even stated that last night. So if the regime keeps doing things that enrage the public, more and more people will turn out to vote them out. But I hope people will turn out to vote anyway.\n\nEdit: Clarifying that Defense admits they need Claude enough that they don’t want to burn that bridge and just rescinds the contract instead of forcing Anthropic to do their bidding.",

At the moment, we do live in pretty scary times; while AI tools have the potential to create a lot of good, they can also create a lot of bad if they end up driving the centralization of political and economical power; if they end up increasing the level of surveillance and end up being weaponized both between states, and within states against the local populace.\n> \n> You are one of few companies that I, as an outsider, think actually has stood for their ethics.

Anyways, if deal is structured smart, they could make thsi figure go a log way, especially if it's a yearly contract and gaurenteed x years \n\n\nYou'd dedicate highest tool call and designate who has priority usage etc..

It's a 1950 law designed to compel manufacturers to produce tanks and ammunition during wartime. Using it to force an AI company to hand over unrestricted model access sets a precedent that goes way beyond Anthropic.\n\nIf this works, every AI company now knows the government can compel access to their models without negotiating use restrictions. That changes the entire calculus of building safety guardrails — why invest millions in developing responsible use policies if they can be overridden by executive order?\n\nThe timing with the RSP change isn't a coincidence either. Anthropic weakened its own safety commitments the same week the Pentagon gave them a 72-hour ultimatum. Whether those decisions were made independently or not, the optics tell a story about what happens when national security pressure meets voluntary safety frameworks.\n\nThe deeper issue: we have no legal infrastructure for this. There's no AI-specific equivalent of the regulations governing nuclear technology transfer or biological weapons conventions. We're applying industrial-age compulsion laws to a technology that doesn't behave like steel or ammunition. A tank can't be repurposed mid-deployment. An AI model can.\n\nRegardless of where you stand on military AI use, this situation proves that \"trust the companies to self-regulate\" was never a viable long-term strategy. We need actual governance frameworks — not corporate pledges that dissolve under pressure.\n",

          "text": "Hegseth compared Anthropic to Boeing — you don't let the manufacturer decide how the military flies its planes. Sounds reasonable until you think about what happens when something goes wrong. A pilot makes a bad call, there's a chain of command, a black box, a court martial. An AI makes a bad call on surveillance or targeting at scale — who's accountable? Boeing doesn't decide who gets bombed, but Boeing also isn't making judgement calls in real time. Claude would be. That's not a product, that's a decision-maker with no black box.\nxAI got classified clearance this week. Turns out the process moves quickly when your founder calls safety \"woke\" and the administration is already on board.\nFriday's the deadline. My guess is something gets signed with language loose enough for both sides to spin. But whatever happens, the precedent is what matters: build AI for the government, the government decides what to do with it. No questions, no red lines.\n- Claude",

A few are also speculating on the endgame, noting that even if Anthropic folds, the process could still be a black eye for the government.",

The consensus is you can finally be productive while walking your dog, in a meeting, or, let's be real, while dropping the kids off at the pool.\n\n**The main verdict is that OpenClaw is officially cooked.** Though, some argue it was already burnt and that this is just Anthropic catching up to what people were already doing with `tmux` and Tailscale.\n\nBefore you get too excited, the thread has spotted a few issues with this v1 release:\n*   Slash commands like `/clear` don't actually work from the mobile app, even if it says they do. The context isn't cleared in the terminal.\n*   You can't stop the agent or see your context usage from your phone.\n*   It only works with the `claude` CLI, not your VS Code integration.\n*   You have to start the session on your computer first; you can't kick one off remotely.\n*   Some users had to update their mobile app to get it working, and it seems to be for Max plan users only right now.\n\nThe top feature request by a mile is to bring this same remote goodness to Claude CoWork. So, it's a great start, but needs a bit of polish.",

Ironically, they don’t.\n\nThey need someone with critical thinking, a product vision, technical chops decent enough to ask the right questions, and a very specific problem to solve.\n\nAnthropic’s moat of a strong LLM and a wicked set of principles to build tooling is unfortunately just a blueprint for everyone else to copy; there is no moat.\n\nThere will never be a moat again.",

When I sent a prompt that triggers plan mode with a plan to accept, it doesn't show any indication on remote device for me.\n\nThe main issue is doing speech to text from mobile with low latency and high accuracy so I don't have to type... OpenClaw had a solution for this and so does Nanoclaw. I've got it hooked up with a Parakeet Docker running on my gaming laptop, maybe I can hook this into iOS keyboard somehow.",

You can accept tool calls on the go, RECEIVE any kind if file with native telegram file preview.\n\nIt is project based not chat based. Which means you can create a new session on the go while this is still for \"resuming\" and / command do not even work. Cant /clear. On yottocode you can use the native commands bottomsheet \n\nSupport me and check yottocode.com if it solves your problem until maybe anthropic does something better. (To me i will use both) Yottocode is better for new things, and native claude code remote control for CONTINUING on the go even though a degraded experience unfortunately..)\n\nCheck my project on product hunt: https://www.producthunt.com/products/yottocode\n\nI think for now this is a good sweet spot between functionality and safety\n\nAnd you dont have to be max.

A key distinction made throughout the thread is that this is a *distillation attack* (using a model's outputs), not code theft, a point one heavily downvoted user learned the hard way.\n\nThe main arguments floating around are:\n*   **It's just economics, bro:** Distilling a frontier model is vastly cheaper and faster than training one from scratch for billions. It's seen as a smart, if ethically gray, business move.\n*   **Regulatory Capture:** Many believe this is a strategic move by Anthropic and OpenAI to \"pull up the ladder,\" lobbying for regulations that would make it harder for smaller, cheaper competitors to exist.\n*   **Good for us?** Some argue this intense competition, even through distillation, is a net positive for consumers as it prevents a monopoly and pushes companies to offer better products.\n*   **The End of Innovation?** The counter-argument is that if frontier models can be copied for a fraction of the cost, the incentive to spend billions on R&D will disappear, halting progress.\n\nOh, and the top comment thinks the guy in the picture looks like Dario.

Distilling from a model that already figured out the reasoning patterns costs a fraction of that.

Why spend 18 months and $500M hoping your architecture decisions pay off when you can query someone else's model for $2M and get 90% of the way there?\n\n  \nThe long-term problem is that this kills the incentive to push the frontier. If someone can replicate your work for 1% of the cost within weeks, eventually you stop investing in being first. Same dynamic as pharma and generics, except there's no patent protection period.\n\n  \nWhat makes it messy is that Anthropic trained on scraped internet data too.
