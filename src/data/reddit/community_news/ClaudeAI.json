          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 100 comments.**\n\nAlright, let's break down the chatter on this new plan mode update.\n\n**The big news is that Claude Code now offers to reset the context after planning, which Anthropic says improves reliability.** Boris from Anthropic dropped a bunch of knowledge bombs in the comments (via the OP), and here's the gist:\n*   **Pro-Tip for more context:** If you feel like the auto-compact buffer is eating your context, **decrease your `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` environment variable**. The two trade off against each other.\n*   The default option is to clear context because that's what most people prefer. They're not going to switch the options around and mess with your muscle memory.\n*   Your plans are saved to a file. Use `/plan` to see or edit it.\n*   Boris's recommendation? **Clear** the context, don't just compact it.\n\n**The community consensus is that this is a great QoL update, but many power users were already doing this manually.** A lot of you were already having Claude write a plan to a `.md` file, then starting a fresh session to execute it. This update just automates that process, which is a welcome time-saver. Some are even saying Anthropic is just building their personal workflows directly into the tool.\n\nHowever, it's not all perfect. The biggest gripe, with a ton of upvotes, is that **folks are getting really tired of Claude including the *entire* old plan in the new one**, making it a nightmare to read. Other recurring complaints include the auto-compact feature \"nuking nuance\" and concerns about increased token burn from re-doing research.\n\nAs usual, the pros in this thread are sharing their own advanced setups. A highly-upvoted comment details a \"Ralph-like\" loop using a Markdown spec file, an `/implement` command, and a script to run Claude on a loop, which is a practical way to build large projects on a Pro license. Others are using task boards like \"beads\" to manage state.\n\n**Verdict: A solid, much-needed feature that formalizes a community best practice. While there are still kinks to work out in plan mode (looking at you, repetitive plans), the community is generally happy to see Anthropic listening and integrating user workflows.**",

          "text": "**1)** Auto compact has a habit of nuking nuance. Finding that I need to repeat the details each time this happens\n\n**Boris:** Getting auto-compact perfect is suuuper hard but we're working on it.\n\n**2)** boris why does it default to that every time? If the task is in one shot and I have a few shots with a given agent, it doesn't make sense to set that as the default option.\n\nIf anything, you should switch 1 and 3 now.\n\n**Boris:** because most of the time people prefer to clear. Don't want to switch options around on people dynamically -- it breaks muscle memory.\n\n**3)** Any way we can have it do a fresh context window each ralph loop?\n\n**Boris:** Have ralph run/clear\n\n**4) (a)** the compacting buffer is really becoming a pain in the neck and making the whole experience stressful Boris, almost 40% out of the door\n\n**Boris:** Reduce your CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS or rm the env var, and you'll decrease the buffer to 45k.\n\n**4) (b)** still at the same value even reducing by 50%\n\n**Boris:** The formula for the auto-compact buffer is really simple: (contextWindow - maxOutputTokens) - (small constant)\n\nBy default, the buffer is 45k. If it’s larger than that for you, it means your maxOutputTokens is large.\n\nTo increase your effective context window, decrease maxOutputTokens. The two trade off against one another.\n\n**5)** I've developed an aversion to plan mode because it begins by sending out explore agents, then reasons based on the results, and then starts a plan agent that has little context and has to do the exploring all over again, which feels inefficient. Does it still work like that?\n\n**Boris:** Claude usually only uses Plan agents. The subagents generally result in better plans, though it's a thing we're actively tinkering with.\n\n**6)** will there be a blog publishing all these findings?\n\n**Boris:** Too busy coding but we should probably blog more.\n\n**7)** Does the original plan get saved somewhere?\n\n**Boris:** yes, it's saved to a file. /plan to see it or edit it manually in an IDE\n\n**8)** Clear context or compact context?\n\n**Boris:** Clear\n\n**And atlast in another post he said:** Glad to see Claude Code starting to break through. It’s been a year of very hard work, and we’re just getting started.\n\nLinking this [WSJ Article ](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/anthropic-claude-code-ai-7a46460e)",

                  "text": "This is the real core of the Ralph idea, I only just got it because I was distracted by all the talk of \"the loop\" and all the terrible vague explanations. But at heart it's just a revival of the idea of having a plain English specification that captures all your grand ideas for what the product should be, broken up into markdown files, which you can maintain with the help of Claude, or when you hit your limit you can hand-edit the spec to fill out more feature ideas.\n\nThis is the core of it, having a specification. In my version every feature in the spec has a ✅ if it's done or a 🟦 if it's not done. I have an `/implement` command that says \"Find a not-done feature, read around the spec to make sure you understand how it fits in, implement it, commit to git.\" Then I have a little node script that runs `claude -p /implement` in a loop, sleeping for an hour if the output says it hit the limi, quitting if there's no more not-done tasks.\n\nThe loop is the boring part. The important part is having a specification, such that each run of the loop can be a clean new claude session whose only context is the spec and what it can discover by reading the code.\n\nThis makes it practical to build something fairly feature rich on a Pro license with Opus, the best model. It eats through the usage limit like a forest fire. But you don't care because you just leave the loop running and go to bed. In the morning you test all the new features that were implemented why you slept.",

It's the \"SoundCloud era of software\" and the \"ideas guys\" are having their moment.\n\nHowever, the excitement is tempered with a healthy dose of reality from the more experienced devs in the room.\n\n*   **It's not magic:** You can't just \"code in plain English\" for complex projects. You still need to understand software architecture and engineering principles to guide the AI and avoid creating a buggy, unmaintainable mess. The AI is a powerful intern, not a senior architect.\n*   **The future is full of slop:** Many predict a future flooded with low-quality apps and security vulnerabilities created by \"vibe coders\" who don't know what they're doing. A skilled engineer's job will be to clean up the mess.\n*   **The job market is changing, not dying:** The general feeling is that this makes senior devs *more* valuable by freeing them up to focus on high-level problems (like product and architecture), but it might be the end of the road for many junior dev roles.\n*   **Enjoy the cheap prices while they last:** Several users pointed out that the current low cost is likely a temporary strategy to get everyone hooked before the prices inevitably go up.",

It has way more functionality than the original after a conversation with Claude about my list of requests and an ask for it to make some suggestions. When I think about the cost to have hired someone to build this, it’s a totally different and nearly unrecognizable process.\n\nAs I think about the developers that I work with, or have over the last 20 years, I probably could’ve gotten the first draft done for 500 bucks domestically, maybe six or 700 after a few more revisions and probably two or 300 internationally.\n\nI would’ve spent the same amount of time explaining what I needed and testing the output that I did building it myself with Claude. \n\nI would expect better code and output from one of the human developers, but I also know that several of them would have waited until the last minute and skipped several steps to ensure the most reliable and secure deliverable. Frankly, a few of them would have just thrown it into a GPT system at the last minute and delivered complete slop that needed a ton of revisions anyway. \n\nI know it can’t do everything and that more complex components and customizations are still practically out of reach, but it’s really quite remarkable to look at this after more than 20 years of building websites and to think about what might be different here in 2026. A lot of the peripheral work is just going to go in this direction and I can focus my Dev team on higher order objectives.",

Conversely, watch who is saying that these things aren't all that great. It's the guys who are fluent in multiple languages and have worked as professional devs for 20-30 years.\n\nPoint is, AI is now smart enough to fool beginners.\n\nIf you play Chess against an opponent who is stronger than you, you can tell that they are better than you, but you cannot tell how much better they are. You just cannot evaluate them. Same thing applies here. Beginners are not in a place to be able to properly evaluate the quality of AI code.",

Software folks traditionally went through that painful, difficult process of learning how software and computer systems actually work by manually tackling problems. Through debugging and troubleshooting. It takes years to develop that intuitive sense. \n\nWith this new reality, I’m terrified about the learning process. Will we still have human experts capable of truly and completely understanding the system in case it fails? These new tools are far less conducive to that kind of learning, and yet whenever I use them I feel like my experience very frequently saves the day and helps me get things back on track. \n\nSo either the tools rapidly improve to the point where having that human expertise is no longer an issue, or we have a serious problem on our hands because this new Claude Code generation of software engineers likely won’t have those skills. \n\nSo yes. I AM absolutely astounded and honestly if you asked me a few short years ago I would have told you this likely won’t happen in our lifetimes, and yet here it is. But there are also some real dangers, and it’s not just the plainly obvious “it’ll take all our jobs away”.",

Two, I had done this using Codex and what feels like great ends up being bad. Codex wanted to fix too many problems by not looking for thd root cause but looking for a workaround. Example, an object needs not to appear on the scene because the games ever is not sending the correct data because of a sync/delay issue. Rather than looking at the game server as to what is wrong and why the server was sending out bad data after being updated it started ignoring transactions for x seconds after making a change, waiting for the server to start sending good data. \n\nAlso, rather than simply making a flag for true or false it wrote way too much code and conditions to handle the situation. \nMy project was an attempt to create a game entirely by vibe coding. I’m about to finish it in the next month and then do a similar game with Claude. \n\nThe biggest challenge is the UI. As far as Codex, and I’m sure others there is a gap in amazing when interfacing with 3rd party software like Unity. But I’m convinced that it is just a matter of time and updates to the AI and improvements will come fast. \n\nThe biggest frustration is when Codex kept attempting the same coding fixes over and over. As well as it insisted that I wasn’t running the latest code because the log files didn’t indicate it while oh my leads to verify that the code was being called and it not looking only to find out that the entire script was never in use. But Codex and it’s session compacting and getting lost every time it did so, always forgetting that I told it things, such as don’t commit and push automatically, document your code, keep the code complexity below a level of 7, when asking it a question it didn’t answer but started modifying the code, and the silly acts of it saying things like “I’m going to manually…”. And “I see the problem now.”\nI had told it just to say “I found something “ but it forgets.",

The internal messaging claims Copilot has \"mostly closed the gaps\" with Claude Code.\n\nExceptions exist for \"high-priority R&D\" who can still get Anthropic API access with justification.

However, the more popular opinion in this thread is that Microsoft is terrible at dogfooding and has a knack for lobotomizing good models.\n\nFor the devs in the room, here's the deal:\n*   You can still use Claude models (like Sonnet and Opus) inside GitHub Copilot.\n*   **BUT**, the community agrees the Copilot \"harness\" is a major downgrade. It nerfs the models with a tiny 128k context window and is just a clunkier experience than the Claude Code agent.\n*   There's also some debate on how widespread the Claude Code rollout was in the first place, with conflicting reports from users claiming to be MS employees.",

Plus, they don't use the models themselves and so they probably get lied to by their teams about performance. \"Yeah look boss, we beat all the benchmarks in the world, we're now the #1 model, give us a huge bonus\".

I used it 2 days ago and I was amazed and how fast they are catching up to CC in usability, understanding human commands in the context of patterning what a person just did and understanding what they want next.  Claude Code is fantastic at this game of keeping up with the user's mindset, keeping it's head in the game, anticipating the next thing.  For the first time, I used Codex and felt like it was really \"in the zone\" with me. Not there yet, but they are laying down comparable features.   \n\nAgentic IDEs are a different mindset.

      "text": "Hi r/ClaudeAI,\n\nSince the release of **Claude Code**, I’ve been using it extensively. However, I quickly noticed a major bottleneck when working on large codebases: token consumption explodes whenever you ask the agent to explore the project structure.\n\nThe culprit is the reliance on basic tools like `grep` or `glob` for file discovery. To find relevant code, Claude often has to:\n\n1. List dozens of files.\n2. Read them one by one to check relevance.\n3. Launch expensive \"subagents\" to dig through directories.\n\n**The Solution: GrepAI** To fix this, I developed **GrepAI**, an open-source CLI tool (written in Go) that replaces this brute-force process with **local semantic search** (via Ollama/embeddings) and call graph analysis.\n\nInstead of searching for exact keywords, the agent finds code by \"meaning.\"\n\n**The Benchmark (Tested on Excalidraw - 155k lines)** I ran a controlled benchmark comparing \"vanilla\" Claude Code vs. Claude Code + GrepAI on 5 identical development tasks.\n\nThe results were pretty significant:\n\n* 📉 **-97% Input Tokens** (dropped from \\~51k to \\~1.3k during the search phase).\n* 💰 **-27.5% Total Cost** (including cache creation/read costs).\n* 🚀 **0 Subagents launched** with GrepAI (vs. 5 with the standard method), which drastically speeds up the workflow.\n\nThe tool allows Claude to pinpoint the right files on the first try, avoiding the \"List -> Read -> Filter -> Repeat\" loop.\n\n👉 **Full protocol and results:**[https://yoanbernabeu.github.io/grepai/blog/benchmark-grepai-vs-grep-claude-code/](https://yoanbernabeu.github.io/grepai/blog/benchmark-grepai-vs-grep-claude-code/)\n\n**Project Links:**\n\n* 📦 **GitHub:**[https://github.com/yoanbernabeu/grepai](https://github.com/yoanbernabeu/grepai)\n* 🌐 **Docs & Install:**[https://yoanbernabeu.github.io/grepai/](https://yoanbernabeu.github.io/grepai/)\n\nIf you are looking to optimize your API costs or just make Claude \"smarter\" about your local codebase, I’d love to hear your feedback!",

Many are excited to try it out.\n\nHowever, the top-voted comment proposes a much simpler, manual alternative: **just create a detailed `scriptReferences.md` file** that lists all your scripts, their purpose, and their locations. The user outlines a whole workflow using multiple markdown files to guide Claude, which the community loved.\n\nHere are the other key takeaways:\n\n*   **The Big Question:** Does this actually improve coding or just save tokens? Many users are concerned that giving Claude less context via snippets (instead of full files) might make it \"lazier\" or lead to worse code, a point not covered by OP's cost-focused benchmarks.\n*   **Alternative Tools:** Commenters brought up several similar projects, including Aider's `repomap`, LSP-based tools like `Serena`, and even a custom SQLite/FTS5 setup, suggesting this is a common problem people are trying to solve.\n*   **Practical Concerns:** A few users who tried the tool reported getting irrelevant search results. On the plus side, OP confirmed the tool has a **daemon mode to automatically re-index your files** as you edit them, which was a common question.\n*   **Side Note:** A lot of you really, *really* hate \"LinkedIn-style\" posts with all the emojis. We hear you.",

          "text": "Most agent token waste comes from uncontrolled discovery. Claude lists directories, opens files speculatively, greps vaguely, then repeats. Embeddings isn't worth the effort IMHO. What a headache to manage....\n\nEmbeddings introduce a model dependency, indexing overhead, and constant invalidation when code changes or text changes (I use rg/FTS in my obsidian vault). I avoided embeddings entirely.\n\nSo Claude burns tokens when it lists directories, reads files speculatively, repeats search attempts with slightly altered prompts, spawns sub-contexts or agents or rereads overlapping content...\n\nFor larger repos or large text files (e.g. Obsidian vaults), I added a small Python CLI that maintains a local SQLite database under ./SEARCH using FTS5. The database gets updated explicitly via a command which takes <2 seconds to run. No daemon. No file watchers. No background churn. ripgrep is also included. FTS provides ranked recall when identifiers are unknown.\n\nJust an explicit instruction in the local project's CLAUDE.md file to use ./search.py to find anything it needs in the current codebase. Claude is told to explore directly only as a last resort. Every discovery step starts with the CLI (./search.py command). The script blends ripgrep results with FTS5 results and returns a compact shortlist containing file paths, line ranges, and minimal snippets. Claude may open one or two files. The results come back as structured json.\n\nIndex freshness stays deterministic. This works because the agent no longer performs discovery inside its context window. Retrieval becomes a single structured ***tool call*** instead of iterative file reads. Token usage drops because Claude reasons over selected evidence rather than the whole repo surface area. I'm not sure how much they drop though, I never measured it. but it stands to  reason that selected snippets < whole file reads.\n\nBut this does NOT replace embeddings and I don't claim its better.\n\nIt just replaces agent thrash and saves some tokens on large repos/files. ***Also it saves me from hitting the /compact wall so quickly.***\n\nI use this exact method for my work-based obsidian vault. I have dozens of work meeting transcripts, notes, etc in there... and using cheap-and-dirty Haiku as a NotebookLM-LITE with this tool, it's better than NotebookLM for me (infographs and podcast generation aside) and I'm not limited to 50 queries/day in the free tier of NotebookLM.\n\nI leave it to Claude to tell me which snippets rg/FTS found that are relevant to my question/task since it has the intelligence to apply context to the search results. It's worked well for me.\n\nFor repos with frequent change and developers already fluent with rg-style search, an FTS5 plus ripgrep sidecar method gives most of the benefit with far less operational complexity you need with embeddings.\n\nThe search tool can live in any dir and is 10 files.\n\nAlso it can index multiple repos, directories into the same 1 database and so it can be called universally from any location on your system, you don't need to copy it to every project dir.\n\nEdit: posted to my github: https://github.com/seqis/AI-grep",

A lot of users argue that the tool itself isn't the \"secret sauce\"—the Opus model is—and that by open-sourcing the harness, Anthropic could set the industry standard. Others worry this would just help competitors or that Anthropic's \"insider advantage\" in building the tool for their own model is what makes it special.\n\nDespite the skepticism about the source of the hype, **everyone agrees that AI is a massive paradigm shift for coding.** The general feeling is it's like the invention of the calculator, abstracting away syntax and letting developers focus on the real problems.

The thread is **overwhelmingly against you on this one.**\n\nThe consensus is that you're not worried about national security, you're worried about Chinese competition hurting Anthropic's bottom line. Users are calling it a classic \"capitalists love the free market until it's their monopoly on the line\" moment.\n\nA lot of folks, especially non-Americans, are pointing out that the US is just as scary as a global power, and that a US monopoly on powerful AI is a worse outcome than having competing powers. Others argue that blocking chip sales is a bad move anyway, as it just forces China to develop its own chip industry, which would be a bigger threat in the long run. There's even a debate on whether China is actually buying the Nvidia chips being offered.\n\nOh, and for the record, the thread corrected someone who said TSMC has bombs in their factories. They have remote kill switches, not actual bombs. Let's not give anyone any ideas.",

It's skills all the way down, folks.\n\nOn the serious side, the community is split:\n\n*   **Team \"This is how you get context bloat\":** The main concern, and a highly upvoted one, is that this will just create a mountain of useless skills, eat all your tokens, and make Claude dumber over time.\n*   **Team \"Actually, this is genius\":** The counter-argument is that skills are lazy-loaded (so they don't bloat context unless called) and this could be a great way to have Claude auto-improve its own toolkit. A few users are already doing this and say it's helping their workflow.\n\nThis also kicked off a side-debate on whether skills are useful at all, with some devs calling them a gimmick and others swearing by them for repeatable tasks like formatting git commits or managing Jira tickets.",

OP, who has a background in ML, assured everyone he was rigorous with his train/validation splits and backtesting on withheld data.\n\nThere was also a serious warning from a user with a MedTech background about the dangers of sharing this as an unregulated medical app. OP was in total agreement, emphasizing this is a personal project and he only wants to empower others to analyze their *own* data.\n\nFor those asking the practical questions:\n*   **Data Source:** OP used 9.5 years of data from his Apple Watch (exported via Apple Health) and Whoop.\n*   **Claude Plan:** He's using the $100/mo Max plan with Claude Code.\n*   **How it \"runs models\":** Claude doesn't run them directly. It writes the Python scripts that use standard ML libraries (like XGBoost) to do the actual model training and selection.",

My GP is great and understood,  sent me for the tests... which confirmed what Claude identified and I started treatment 2 days ago. Because the standard blood tests look normal,  this would never have been found without Claude figuring it out... and my health would have gradually declined and it would just have been put down to \"ageing\", no matter what I tried to do to improve it.",

Using LLMs to synthesize years of personal health data into actionable insights is a powerful demonstration of how these tools can assist an individual’s self-management.\n\n​However, I want to offer a professional perspective on the idea of 'emulating' this for others or sharing this as a repo for public use. While this works for you, expanding this to additional users is a significant leap that moves from personal experimentation into unregulated medical device territory, which raises serious ethical and safety concerns:\n\n​Biological Variance: A model trained on 9.5 years of your specific physiology (Apple Watch/Whoop data) is hyper-fit to you. Deploying it for others (whose baselines, comorbidities, and hormonal profiles differ) could lead to dangerous false negatives or positives.\n\n​The 'Black Box' Risk: In MedTech, we prioritize clinical validation. LLMs can hallucinate correlations in health data that aren't medically sound. For a third party, following an unvalidated 'risk assessor' app could delay professional medical intervention.\n\n​Regulatory & Ethical Responsibility: Even with disclaimers, providing a tool designed to 'detect phases' of a disease like Graves’ carries the ethical weight of a medical diagnosis. Without clinical trials and regulatory oversight (like FDA/CE marking), distributing this tool bypasses the safety standards designed to protect patients.\n\n​I really, really applaud the initiative for your own health, but I strongly urge you to keep this as a personal project rather than a public tool. \n\nThe transition from 'n-of-1' experimentation to a shared resource requires a level of rigorous validation that code alone cannot provide",

I've worked in and around data science for a good portion of my career so share the same thoughts on the adaptability and overfitting to my specific data. This was purely an n = 1 for 1 user experiment to be clear from the model perspective. hence why I call it \"personal ML\"\n\nI would never think at all to apply this model and its weights to another user, it would likely fail pretty miserably. But what I do find interesting is adapting the 'process' of discovering models that are overfit to an individual with this new access we have to LLM's and agents.\n\nThe main ideas I have around extending this for others is more along the lines of giving them pre-packaged resources and tools to study their own data via agents with heavy disclaimers of the personal experimental nature of it. Just writing the guide on my approach to agent driven ML is a starting point, working on tools that can abstract away the clunkiness of modern coding agents to fit better in domain specific data science applications is something I want to work towards.\n\nSo again, I echo all of your concerns. My main goal outside of continuing to explore my own data is to give people tools to explore their data(not their disease or condition).",

      "text": "[My previous post with 10 tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1qcan9z/my_top_10_claude_code_tips_from_11_months_of/) was well-received, so I decided to expand it to 25 here.\n\nThe GitHub repo: [https://github.com/ykdojo/claude-code-tips](https://github.com/ykdojo/claude-code-tips)\n\n# Tip 0: Customize your status line\n\nYou can customize the status line at the bottom of Claude Code to show useful info. I set mine up to show the model, current directory, git branch (if any), uncommitted file count, sync status with origin, and a visual progress bar for token usage. It also shows a second line with my last message so I can see what the conversation was about:\n\n    Opus 4.5 | 📁claude-code-tips | 🔀main (scripts/context-bar.sh uncommitted, synced 12m ago) | ██░░░░░░░░ 18% of 200k tokens\n    💬 This is good. I don't think we need to change the documentation as long as we don't say that the default color is orange el...\n\nThis is especially helpful for keeping an eye on your context usage and remembering what you were working on. The script also supports 10 color themes (orange, blue, teal, green, lavender, rose, gold, slate, cyan, or gray).\n\nTo set this up, you can use [this sample script](https://github.com/ykdojo/claude-code-tips/blob/main/scripts/context-bar.sh) and check the [setup instructions](https://github.com/ykdojo/claude-code-tips/blob/main/scripts/README.md).\n\n# Tip 1: Learn a few essential slash commands\n\nThere are a bunch of built-in slash commands (type `/` to see them all). Here are a few worth knowing:\n\n# /usage\n\nCheck your rate limits:\n\n     Current session\n     ███████                                            14% used\n     Resets 3:59pm (Asia/Tokyo)\n    \n     Current week (all models)\n     █████████████                                      26% used\n     Resets Jan 3, 2026, 5:59am (Asia/Tokyo)\n\nIf you want to watch your usage closely, keep it open in a tab and use Tab then Shift+Tab or ← then → to refresh.\n\n# /chrome\n\nToggle Claude's native browser integration:\n\n    > /chrome\n    Chrome integration enabled\n\n# /mcp\n\nManage MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers:\n\n     Manage MCP servers\n     1 server\n    \n     ❯ 1. playwright  ✔ connected · Enter to view details\n    \n     MCP Config locations (by scope):\n      • User config (available in all your projects):\n        • /Users/yk/.claude.json\n\n# /stats\n\nView your usage statistics with a GitHub-style activity graph:\n\n          Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n          ·············································▒▒▒▓▒░█\n      Mon ··············································▒█░▓░█\n          ·············································▒▒██▓░█\n      Wed ·············································░▒█▒▓░█\n          ············································░▓▒█▓▓░\n      Fri ············································░▓░█▓▓█\n          ············································▓▒░█▓▒█\n    \n          Less ░ ▒ ▓ █ More\n    \n      Favorite model: Opus 4.5        Total tokens: 12.1m\n    \n      Sessions: 1.8k                  Longest session: 20h 40m 45s\n      Current streak: 44 days         Longest streak: 45 days\n      Active days: 49/51              Peak hour: 17:00-18:00\n    \n      You've used ~145x more tokens than Brave New World\n\n# /clear\n\nClear the conversation and start fresh.\n\n# Tip 2: Talk to Claude Code with your voice\n\nI found that I can communicate much faster with my voice than typing with my hands. Using a voice transcription system on your local machine is really helpful for this.\n\nOn my Mac, I've tried a few different options:\n\n* superwhisper\n* MacWhisper\n* [Super Voice Assistant](https://github.com/ykdojo/super-voice-assistant)\n\nYou can get more accuracy by using a hosted service, but I found that a local model is strong enough for this purpose. Even when there are mistakes or typos in the transcription, Claude is smart enough to understand what you're trying to say. Sometimes you need to say certain things extra clearly, but overall local models work well enough.\n\nFor example, Claude was able to interpret mistranscribed words like \"ExcelElanishMark\" and \"advast\" correctly as \"exclamation mark\" and \"Advanced\".\n\nA common objection is \"what if you're in a room with other people?\" I just whisper using earphones - I personally like Apple EarPods (not AirPods). They're affordable, high quality enough, and you just whisper into them quietly. I've done it in front of other people and it works well. In offices, people talk anyway - instead of talking to coworkers, you're talking quietly to your voice transcription system. I don't think there's any problem with that. This method works so well that it even works on a plane. It's loud enough that other people won't hear you, but if you speak close enough to the mic, your local model can still understand what you're saying. (In fact, I'm writing this very paragraph using that method on a flight.)\n\n# Tip 3: Break down large problems into smaller ones\n\nThis is one of the most important concepts to master. It's exactly the same as traditional software engineering - the best software engineers already know how to do this, and it applies to Claude Code too.\n\nIf you find that Claude Code isn't able to one-shot a difficult problem or coding task, ask it to break it down into multiple smaller issues. See if it can solve an individual part of that problem. If it's still too hard, see if it can solve an even smaller sub-problem. Keep going until everything is solvable.\n\nEssentially, instead of going from A to B directly, you can go from A to A1 to A2 to A3, then to B.\n\nA good example of this is when I was building my own voice transcription system. I needed to build a system that could let the user select and download a model, take keyboard shortcuts, start transcribing, put the transcribed text at the user's cursor, and wrap all of this in a nice UI. That's a lot. So I broke it down into smaller tasks. First, I created an executable that would just download a model, nothing else. Then I created another one that would just record voice, nothing else. Then another one that would just transcribe pre-recorded audio. I completed them one by one like that before combining them at the end.\n\nHighly related to this: your problem-solving skills and software engineering skills are still highly relevant in the world of agentic coding and Claude Code. It's able to solve a lot of problems on its own, but when you apply your general problem-solving and software engineering skills to it, it becomes a lot more powerful.\n\n# Tip 4: Using Git and GitHub CLI like a pro\n\nJust ask Claude to handle your Git and GitHub CLI tasks. This includes committing (so you don't have to write commit messages manually), branching, pulling, and pushing.\n\nI personally allow pull automatically but not push, because push is riskier - it doesn't contaminate the origin if something goes wrong with a pull.\n\nFor GitHub CLI (`gh`), there's a lot you can do. One thing I started doing more after using Claude Code is creating draft PRs. This lets Claude Code handle the PR creation process with low risk - you can review everything before marking it ready for review.\n\nAnd it turns out, `gh` is pretty powerful. You can even send arbitrary GraphQL queries through it. For example, you can even find the exact times at which GitHub PR descriptions were edited:\n\n    ⏺ Bash(gh api graphql -f query='\n          query {\n            repository(owner: \"...\", name: \"...\") {\n              pullRequest(number: ...) {\n                userContentEdits(first: 100) {\n                  nodes { editedAt editor { login } }\n                }\n              }\n            }\n          }')\n    \n    ⏺ Here's the full edit history for your PR description:\n    \n      | #  | Edited At (UTC)     | Editor |\n      |----|---------------------|--------|\n      | 1  | 2025-12-01 00:08:34 | ykdojo |\n      | 2  | 2025-12-01 15:57:21 | ykdojo |\n      | 3  | 2025-12-01 16:24:33 | ykdojo |\n      | 4  | 2025-12-01 16:27:00 | ykdojo |\n      | 5  | 2025-12-04 00:40:02 | ykdojo |\n      ...\n\n# Tip 5: AI context is like milk; it's best served fresh and condensed!\n\nWhen you start a new conversation with Claude Code, it performs the best because it doesn't have all the added complexity of having to process the previous context from earlier parts of the conversation. But as you talk to it longer and longer, the context gets longer and the performance tends to go down.\n\nSo it's best to start a new conversation for every new topic, or if the performance starts to go down.\n\n# Tip 6: Getting output out of your terminal\n\nSometimes you want to copy and paste Claude Code's output, but copying directly from the terminal isn't always clean. Here are a few ways to get content out more easily:\n\n* **Clipboard directly**: On Mac or Linux, ask Claude to use `pbcopy` to send output straight to your clipboard\n* **Write to a file**: Have Claude put the content in a file, then ask it to open it in VS Code (or your favorite editor) so you can copy from there. You can also specify a line number, so you can ask Claude to open the specific line it just edited. For markdown files, once it's open in VS Code, you can use Cmd+Shift+P (or Ctrl+Shift+P on Linux/Windows) and select \"Markdown: Open Preview\" to see the rendered version\n* **Opening URLs**: If there's a URL you want to examine yourself, ask Claude to open it in your browser. On Mac, you can ask it to use the `open` command, but in general asking to open in your favorite browser should work on any platform\n* **GitHub Desktop**: You can ask Claude to open the current repo in GitHub Desktop. This is particularly useful when it's working in a non-root directory - for example, if you asked it to create a git worktree in a different directory and you haven't opened Claude Code from there yet\n\nYou can combine some of these together too. For example, if you want to edit a GitHub PR description, instead of having Claude edit it directly (which it might mess up), you can have it copy the content into a local file first. Let it edit that, check the result yourself, and once it looks good, have it copy and paste it back into the GitHub PR. That works really well. Or if you want to do that yourself, you can just ask it to open it in VS Code or give it to you via pbcopy so you can copy and paste it manually.\n\nOf course, you can run these commands yourself, but if you find yourself doing it repetitively, it's helpful to let Claude run them for you.\n\n# Tip 7: Set up terminal aliases for quick access\n\nSince I use the terminal more because of Claude Code, I found it helpful to set up short aliases so I can launch things quickly. Here are the ones I use:\n\n* `c` for Claude Code (this is the one I use the most)\n* `ch` for Claude Code with Chrome integration\n* `gb` for GitHub Desktop\n* `co` for VS Code\n* `q` for going to the project directory where I have most projects. From there I can manually cd into an individual folder to work on that project, or I can just launch Claude Code with `c` to let it basically have access to any project it needs to access.\n\nTo set these up, add lines like this to your shell config file (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`):\n\n    alias c='claude'\n    alias ch='claude --chrome'\n    alias gb='github'\n    alias co='code'\n    alias q='cd ~/Desktop/projects'\n\nOnce you have these aliases, you can combine them with flags: `c -c` continues your last conversation, and `c -r` shows a list of recent conversations to resume. These work with `ch` too (`ch -c`, `ch -r`) for Chrome sessions.\n\n# Tip 8: Proactively compact your context\n\nThere's a `/compact` command in Claude Code that summarizes your conversation to free up context space. Automatic compaction also happens when the full available context is filled. The total available context window for Opus 4.5 is currently 200k, and 45k of that is reserved for automatic compaction. About 10% of the total 200k is automatically filled with the system prompt, tools, memory, and dynamic context. But I found that it's better to proactively do it and manually tune it. I turned off auto-compact with `/config` so I have more context available for the main conversation and more control over when and how compaction happens.\n\nThe way I do this is to ask Claude to write a handoff document before starting fresh. Something like:\n\n>Put the rest of the plan in the system-prompt-extraction folder as HANDOFF.md. Explain what you have tried, what worked, what didn't work, so that the next agent with fresh context is able to just load that file and nothing else to get started on this task and finish it up.\n\nClaude will create a file summarizing the current state of work:\n\n    ⏺ Write(experiments/system-prompt-extraction/HANDOFF.md)\n      ⎿  Wrote 129 lines to experiments/system-prompt-extraction/HANDOFF.md\n         # System Prompt Slimming - Handoff Document\n         ## Goal\n         Reduce Claude Code's system prompt by ~45% (currently at 11%, need ~34% more).\n         ## Current Progress\n         ### What's Been Done\n         - **Backup/restore system**: `backup-cli.sh` and `restore-cli.sh` with SHA256 verification\n         - **Patch system**: `patch-cli.js` that restores from backup then applies patches\n         ...\n\nAfter Claude writes it, review it quickly. If something's missing, ask for edits:\n\n>Did you add a note about iteratively testing instead of trying to do everything all at once?\n\nThen start a fresh conversation. For the fresh agent, you can just give the path of the file and nothing else like this, and it should work just fine:\n\n    > experiments/system-prompt-extraction/HANDOFF.md\n\nIn subsequent conversations, you can ask the agent to update the document for the next agent.\n\nI've also created a `/handoff` slash command that automates this - it checks for an existing HANDOFF.md, reads it if present, then creates or updates it with the goal, progress, what worked, what didn't, and next steps. You can find it in the [commands folder](https://github.com/ykdojo/claude-code-tips/blob/main/commands/handoff.md).\n\n# Tip 9: Complete the write-test cycle for autonomous tasks\n\nIf you want Claude Code to run something autonomously, like `git bisect`, you need to give it a way to verify results. The key is completing the write-test cycle: write code, run it, check the output, and repeat.\n\nFor example, let's say you're working on Claude Code itself and you notice `/compact` stopped working and started throwing a 400 error. A classic tool to find the exact commit that caused this is `git bisect`. The nice thing is you can let Claude Code run bisect on itself, but it needs a way to test each commit.\n\nFor tasks that involve interactive terminals like Claude Code, you can use tmux. The pattern is:\n\n1. Start a tmux session\n2. Send commands to it\n3. Capture the output\n4. Verify it's what you expect\n\nHere's a simple example of testing if `/context` works:\n\n    tmux kill-session -t test-session 2>/dev/null\n    tmux new-session -d -s test-session\n    tmux send-keys -t test-session 'claude' Enter\n    sleep 2\n    tmux send-keys -t test-session '/context' Enter\n    sleep 1\n    tmux capture-pane -t test-session -p\n\nOnce you have a test like this, Claude Code can run `git bisect` and automatically test each commit until it finds the one that broke things.\n\nThis is also an example of why your software engineering skills still matter. If you're a software engineer, you probably know about tools like `git bisect`. That knowledge is still really valuable when working with AI - you just apply it in new ways.\n\nAnother example is simply writing tests. After you let Claude Code write some code, if you want to test it, you can just let it write tests for itself too. And let it run on its own and fix things if it can. Of course, it doesn't always go in the right direction and you need to supervise it sometimes, but it's able to do a surprising amount of coding tasks on its own.\n\n# Creative testing strategies\n\nSometimes you need to be creative with how you complete the write-test cycle. For example, if you're building a web app, you could use Playwright MCP, Chrome DevTools MCP, or Claude's native browser integration (through `/chrome`). I haven't tried Chrome DevTools yet, but I've tried Playwright and Claude's native integration. Overall, Playwright generally works better. It does use a lot of context, but the 200k context window is normally enough for a single task or a few smaller tasks.\n\nThe main difference between these two seems to be that Playwright focuses on the accessibility tree (structured data about page elements) rather than taking screenshots. It does have the ability to take screenshots, but it doesn't normally use them to take actions. On the other hand, Claude's native browser integration focuses more on taking screenshots and clicking on elements by specific coordinates. It can click on random things sometimes, and the whole process can be slow.\n\nThis might improve over time, but by default I would go with Playwright for most tasks that aren't visually intensive. I'd only use Claude's native browser integration if I need to use a logged-in state without having to provide credentials (since it runs in your own browser profile), or if it specifically needs to click on things visually using their coordinates.\n\nThis is why I disable Claude's native browser integration by default and use it through the `ch` shortcut I defined previously. That way Playwright handles most browser tasks, and I only enable Claude's native integration when I specifically need it.\n\nAdditionally, you can ask it to use accessibility tree refs instead of coordinates. Here's what I put in my CLAUDE.md for this:\n\n    # Claude for Chrome\n    \n    - Use `read_page` to get element refs from the accessibility tree\n    - Use `find` to locate elements by description\n    - Click/interact using `ref`, not coordinates\n    - NEVER take screenshots unless explicitly requested by the user\n\nIn my personal experience, I've also had a situation where I was working on a Python library ([Daft](https://github.com/Eventual-Inc/Daft)) and needed to test a version I built locally on Google Colab. The trouble is it's hard to build a Python library with a Rust backend on Google Colab - it doesn't seem to work that well. So I needed to actually build a wheel locally and then upload it manually so that I could run it on Google Colab. I also tried monkey patching, which worked well in the short term before I had to wait for the whole wheel to build locally. I came up with these testing strategies and executed them by going back and forth with Claude Code.\n\nAnother situation I encountered is I needed to test something on Windows but I'm not running a Windows machine. My CI tests on the same repo were failing because we had some issues with Rust on Windows, and I had no way of testing locally. So I needed to create a draft PR with all the changes, and another draft PR with the same changes plus enabling Windows CI runs on non-main branches. I instructed Claude Code to do all of that, and then I tested the CI directly in that new branch.\n\n# Tip 10: Cmd+A and Ctrl+A are your friends\n\nI've been saying this for a few years now: Cmd+A and Ctrl+A are friends in the world of AI. This applies to Claude Code too.\n\nSometimes you want to give Claude Code a URL, but it can't access it directly. Maybe it's a private page (not sensitive data, just not publicly accessible), or something like a Reddit post that Claude Code has trouble fetching. In those cases, you can just select all the content you see (Cmd+A on Mac, Ctrl+A on other platforms), copy it, and paste it directly into Claude Code. It's a pretty powerful method.\n\nThis works great for terminal output too. When I have output from Claude Code itself or any other CLI application, I can use the same trick: select all, copy, and paste it back to CC. Pretty helpful.\n\nSome pages don't lend themselves well to select all by default - but there are tricks to get them into a better state first. For example, with Gmail threads, click Print All to get the print preview (but cancel the actual print). That page shows all emails in the thread expanded, so you can Cmd+A the entire conversation cleanly.\n\nThis applies to any AI, not just Claude Code.\n\n# Tip 11: Use Gemini CLI as a fallback for blocked sites\n\nClaude Code's WebFetch tool can't access certain sites, like Reddit. But you can work around this by creating a skill that tells Claude to use Gemini CLI as a fallback. Gemini has web access and can fetch content from sites that Claude can't reach directly.\n\nThis uses the same tmux pattern from Tip 9 - start a session, send commands, capture output. The skill file goes in `~/.claude/skills/reddit-fetch/SKILL.md`. See [skills/reddit-fetch/SKILL.md](https://github.com/ykdojo/claude-code-tips/blob/main/skills/reddit-fetch/SKILL.md) for the full content.\n\nSkills are more token-efficient because Claude Code only loads them when needed. If you want something simpler, you can put a condensed version in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` instead, but that gets loaded into every conversation whether you need it or not.\n\nI tested this by asking Claude Code to check how Claude Code skills are regarded on Reddit - a bit meta. It goes back and forth with Gemini for a while, so it's not fast, but the report quality was surprisingly good. Obviously, you'll need to have Gemini CLI installed for this to work.\n\n# Tip 12: Invest in your own workflow\n\nPersonally, I've created my own voice transcription app from scratch with Swift. I created my own custom status line from scratch using Claude Code, this one with bash. And I created my own system for simplifying the system prompt in Claude Code's minified JavaScript file.\n\nBut you don't have to go overboard like that. Just taking care of your own CLAUDE.md, making sure it's as concise as possible while being able to help you achieve your goals - stuff like that is helpful. And of course, learning these tips, learning these tools, and some of the most important features.\n\nAll of these are investments in the tools you use to build whatever you want to build. I think it's important to spend at least a little bit of time on that.\n\n# Tip 13: Search through your conversation history\n\nYou can ask Claude Code about your past conversations, and it'll help you find and search through them. Your conversation history is stored locally in `~/.claude/projects/`, with folder names based on the project path (slashes become dashes).\n\nFor example, conversations for a project at `/Users/yk/Desktop/projects/claude-code-tips` would be stored in:\n\n    ~/.claude/projects/-Users-yk-Desktop-projects-claude-code-tips/\n\nEach conversation is a `.jsonl` file. You can search through them with basic bash commands:\n\n    # Find all conversations mentioning \"Reddit\"\n    grep -l -i \"reddit\" ~/.claude/projects/-Users-yk-Desktop-projects-*/*.jsonl\n    \n    # Find today's conversations about a topic\n    find ~/.claude/projects/-Users-yk-Desktop-projects-*/*.jsonl -mtime 0 -exec grep -l -i \"keyword\" {} \\;\n    \n    # Extract just the user messages from a conversation (requires jq)\n    cat ~/.claude/projects/.../conversation-id.jsonl | jq -r 'select(.type==\"user\") | .message.content'\n\nOr just ask Claude Code directly: \"What did we talk about regarding X today?\" and it'll search through the history for you.\n\n# Tip 14: Multitasking with terminal tabs\n\nWhen running multiple Claude Code instances, staying organized is more important than any specific technical setup like Git worktrees. I recommend focusing on at most three or four tasks at a time.\n\nMy personal method is what I would call a \"cascade\" - whenever I start a new task, I just open a new tab on the right. Then I sweep left to right, left to right, going from oldest tasks to newest. The general direction stays consistent, except when I need to check on certain tasks, get notifications, etc.\n\n# Tip 15: Slim down the system prompt\n\nClaude Code's system prompt and tool definitions take up about 19k tokens (\\~10% of your 200k context) before you even start working. I created a patch system that reduces this to about 9k tokens - saving around 10,000 tokens (\\~50% of the overhead).\n\n|Component|Before|After|Savings|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|System prompt|3.0k|1.8k|1,200 tokens|\n|System tools|15.6k|7.4k|8,200 tokens|\n|**Total**|**\\~19k**|**\\~9k**|**\\~10k tokens (\\~50%)**|\n\nThe patches work by trimming verbose examples and redundant text from the minified CLI bundle while keeping all the essential instructions.\n\nI've tested this extensively and it works well. It feels more raw - more powerful, but maybe a little less regulated, which makes sense because the system instruction is shorter. It feels more like a pro tool when you use it this way. I really enjoy starting with lower context because you have more room before it fills up, which gives you the option to continue conversations a bit longer. That's definitely the best part of this strategy.\n\nCheck out the [system-prompt folder](https://github.com/ykdojo/claude-code-tips/tree/main/system-prompt) for the patch scripts and full details on what gets trimmed.\n\n**Why patching?** Claude Code has flags that let you provide a simplified system prompt from a file (`--system-prompt` or `--system-prompt-file`), so that's another way to go about it. But for the tool descriptions, there's no official option to customize them. Patching the CLI bundle is the only way. Since my patch system handles everything in one unified approach, I'm keeping it this way for now. I might re-implement the system prompt portion using the flag in the future.\n\n**Requirements**: These patches require npm installation (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`). The patching works by modifying the JavaScript bundle (`cli.js`) - other installation methods may produce compiled binaries that can't be patched this way.\n\n**Important**: If you want to keep your patched system prompt, disable auto-updates by adding this to `~/.claude/settings.json`:\n\n    {\n      \"env\": {\n        \"DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER\": \"1\"\n      }\n    }\n\nThis applies to all Claude Code sessions regardless of shell type (interactive, non-interactive, tmux). You can manually update later with `npm update -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` when you're ready to re-apply patches to a new version.\n\n# Lazy-load MCP tools\n\nIf you use MCP servers, their tool definitions are loaded into every conversation by default - even if you don't use them. This can add significant overhead, especially with multiple servers configured.\n\nEnable lazy-loading so MCP tools are only loaded when needed:\n\n    {\n      \"env\": {\n        \"ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH\": \"true\"\n      }\n    }\n\nAdd this to `~/.claude/settings.json`. Claude will search for and load MCP tools on-demand rather than having them all present from the start. As of version 2.1.7, this happens automatically when MCP tool descriptions exceed 10% of the context window.\n\n# Tip 16: Git worktrees for parallel branch work\n\nIf you're working on multiple files or multiple branches and you don't want them to get conflicted, Git worktrees are a great way to work on them at the same time. You can just ask Claude Code to create a git worktree and start working on it there - you don't have to worry about the specific syntax.\n\nThe basic idea is that you can work on a different branch in a different directory. It's essentially a branch + a directory.\n\nYou can add this layer of Git worktrees on top of the cascade method I discussed in the multitasking tip.\n\n# Tip 17: Manual exponential backoff for long-running jobs\n\nWhen waiting on long-running jobs like Docker builds or GitHub CI, you can ask Claude Code to do manual exponential backoff. Exponential backoff is a common technique in software engineering, but you can apply it here too. Ask Claude Code to check the status with increasing sleep intervals - one minute, then two minutes, then four minutes, and so on. It's not programmatically doing it in the traditional sense - the AI is doing it manually - but it works pretty well.\n\nThis way the agent can continuously check the status and let you know once it's done.\n\n(For GitHub CI specifically, `gh run watch` exists but outputs many lines continuously, which wastes tokens. Manual exponential backoff with `gh run view <run-id> | grep <job-name>` is actually more token-efficient. This is also a general technique that works well even when you don't have a dedicated wait command handy.)\n\n# Tip 18: Claude Code as a writing assistant\n\nClaude Code is an excellent writing assistant and partner. The way I use it for writing is I first give it all the context about what I'm trying to write, and then I give it detailed instructions by speaking to it using my voice. That gives me the first draft. If it's not good enough, I try a few times.\n\nThen I go through it line by line, pretty much. I say okay, let's take a look at it together. I like this line for these reasons. I feel like this line needs to move over there. This line needs to change in this particular way. I might ask about reference materials as well.\n\nSo it's this sort of back-and-forth process, maybe with the terminal on the left and your code editor on the right. That tends to work really well.\n\n# Tip 19: Markdown is the s**t\n\nTypically when people write a new document, they might use something like Google Docs or maybe Notion. But now I honestly think the most efficient way to go about it is markdown.\n\nMarkdown was already pretty good even before AI, but with Claude Code in particular, because it's so efficient as I mentioned with regards to writing, it makes the value of markdown higher in my opinion. Whenever you want to write a blog post or even a LinkedIn post, you can just talk to Claude Code, have it be saved as markdown, and then go from there.\n\nA quick tip for this one: if you want to copy and paste markdown content into a platform that doesn't accept it easily, you can paste it into a fresh Notion file first, then copy from Notion into the other platform. Notion converts it to a format that other platforms can accept. If regular pasting doesn't work, try Command + Shift + V to paste without formatting.\n\n# Tip 20: Use Notion to preserve links when pasting\n\nIt turns out the reverse also works. If you have text with links from other places, let's say from Slack, you can copy it. If you paste it directly into Claude Code, it doesn't show the links. But if you put it in a Notion document first, then copy from there, you get it in markdown, which of course Claude Code can read.\n\n# Tip 21: Containers for long-running risky tasks\n\nRegular sessions are more for methodical work where you control the permissions you give and review output more carefully. Containerized environments are great for `--dangerously-skip-permissions` sessions where you don't have to give permission for each little thing. You can just let it run on its own for a while.\n\nThis is useful for research or experimentation, things that take a long time and maybe could be risky. A good example is the Reddit research workflow from Tip 11, where the reddit-fetch skill goes back and forth with Gemini CLI through tmux. Running that unsupervised is risky on your main system, but in a container, if something goes wrong, it's contained.\n\nAnother example is how I created the [system prompt patching scripts](https://github.com/ykdojo/claude-code-tips/tree/main/system-prompt) in this repo. When a new version of Claude Code comes out, I need to update the patches for the minified CLI bundle. Instead of running Claude Code with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` on my host machine (where it has access to everything), I run it in a container. Claude Code can explore the minified JavaScript, find the variable mappings, and create new patch files without me approving every little thing that way.\n\nIn fact, it was able to complete the migration pretty much on its own. It tried applying the patches, found that some didn't work with the new version, iterated to fix them, and even improved the [instruction document](https://github.com/ykdojo/claude-code-tips/blob/main/system-prompt/UPGRADING.md) for future instances based on what it learned.\n\nI set up a Docker container with Claude Code, Gemini CLI, tmux, and all the customizations from this repo. Check out the [container folder](https://github.com/ykdojo/claude-code-tips/tree/main/container) for the Dockerfile and setup instructions.\n\n# Advanced: Orchestrating a worker Claude Code in a container\n\nYou can take this further by having your local Claude Code control another Claude Code instance running inside a container. The trick is using tmux as the control layer:\n\n1. Your local Claude Code starts a tmux session\n2. In that tmux session, it runs or connects to the container\n3. Inside the container, Claude Code runs with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`\n4. Your outer Claude Code uses `tmux send-keys` to send prompts and `capture-pane` to read output\n\nThis gives you a fully autonomous \"worker\" Claude Code that can run experimental or long-running tasks without you approving every action. When it's done, your local Claude Code can pull the results back. If something goes wrong, it's all sandboxed in the container.\n\n# Advanced: Multi-model orchestration\n\nBeyond just Claude Code, you can run different AI CLIs in containers - Codex, Gemini CLI, or others. I tried OpenAI Codex for code review, and it works well. The point isn't that you can't run these CLIs directly on your host machine - you obviously can. The value is that Claude Code's UI/UX is smooth enough that you can just talk to it and let it handle the orchestration: spinning up different models, sending data between containers and your host. Instead of manually switching between terminals and copy-pasting, Claude Code becomes the central interface that coordinates everything.\n\n# Tip 22: The best way to get better at using Claude Code is by using it\n\nRecently I saw a world-class rock climber being interviewed by another rock climber. She was asked, \"How do you get better at rock climbing?\" She simply said, \"By rock climbing.\"\n\nThat's how I feel about this too. Of course, there are supplementary things you can do, like watching videos, reading books, learning about tips. But using Claude Code is the best way to learn how to use it. Using AI in general is the best way to learn how to use AI.\n\nI like to think of it like a billion token rule instead of the 10,000 hour rule. If you want to get better at AI and truly get a good intuition about how it works, the best way is to consume a lot of tokens. And nowadays it's possible. I found that especially with Opus 4.5, it's powerful enough but affordable enough that you can run multiple sessions at the same time. You don't have to worry as much about token usage, which frees you up a lot.\n\n# Tip 23: Clone and half-clone conversations\n\nSometimes you want to try a different approach from a specific point in a conversation without losing your original thread. The [clone-conversation script](https://github.com/ykdojo/claude-code-tips/blob/main/scripts/clone-conversation.sh) lets you duplicate a conversation with new UUIDs so you can branch off.\n\nThe first message is tagged with `[CLONED <timestamp>]` (e.g., `[CLONED Jan 7 14:30]`), which shows up both in the `claude -r` list and inside the conversation.\n\nTo set it up manually, symlink both files:\n\n    ln -s /path/to/this/repo/scripts/clone-conversation.sh ~/.claude/scripts/clone-conversation.sh\n    ln -s /path/to/this/repo/commands/clone.md ~/.claude/commands/clone.md\n\nThen just type `/clone` in any conversation and Claude will handle finding the session ID and running the script.\n\nI've tested this extensively and the cloning works really well.\n\n# Half-clone to reduce context\n\nWhen a conversation gets too long, the [half-clone-conversation script](https://github.com/ykdojo/claude-code-tips/blob/main/scripts/half-clone-conversation.sh) keeps only the later half. This reduces token usage while preserving your recent work. The first message is tagged with `[HALF-CLONE <timestamp>]` (e.g., `[HALF-CLONE Jan 7 14:30]`).\n\nTo set it up manually, symlink both files:\n\n    ln -s /path/to/this/repo/scripts/half-clone-conversation.sh ~/.claude/scripts/half-clone-conversation.sh\n    ln -s /path/to/this/repo/commands/half-clone.md ~/.claude/commands/half-clone.md\n\n# Recommended permission for clone scripts\n\nBoth clone scripts need to read `~/.claude` (for conversation files and history). To avoid permission prompts from any project, add this to your global settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`):\n\n    {\n      \"permissions\": {\n        \"allow\": [\"Read(~/.claude)\"]\n      }\n    }\n\n# Tip 24: Use realpath to get absolute paths\n\nWhen you need to tell Claude Code about files in a different folder, use `realpath` to get the full absolute path:\n\n    realpath some/relative/path\n\n# Tip 25: Understanding [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) vs Skills vs Slash Commands vs Plugins\n\nThese are somewhat similar features and I initially found them pretty confusing. I've been unpacking them and trying my best to wrap my head around them, so I wanted to share what I learned.\n\n**CLAUDE.md** is the simplest one. It's a bunch of files that get treated as the default prompt, loaded into the beginning of every conversation no matter what. The nice thing about it is the simplicity. You can explain what the project is about in a particular project (`./CLAUDE.md`) or globally (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`).\n\n**Skills** are like better-structured CLAUDE.md files. They can be invoked by Claude automatically when relevant, or manually by the user with a slash (e.g., `/my-skill`). For example, you could have a skill that opens a Google Translate link with proper formatting when you ask how to pronounce a word in a certain language. If those instructions are in a skill, they only load when needed. If they were in CLAUDE.md, they'd already be there taking up space. So skills are more token-efficient in theory.\n\n**Slash Commands** are similar to skills in that they're ways of packaging instructions separately. They can be invoked manually by the user, or by Claude itself. If you need something more precise, to invoke at the right time at your own pace, slash commands are the tool to use.\n\nSkills and slash commands are pretty similar in the way they function. The difference is the intention of the design - skills are primarily designed for Claude to use, and slash commands are primarily designed for the user to use. However, they have ended up [merging them](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1q92wwv/merged_commands_and_skills_in_213_update/), as I had [suggested this change](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/13115).\n\n**Plugins** are a way to package skills, slash commands, agents, hooks, and MCP servers together. But a plugin doesn't have to use all of them. Anthropic's official `frontend-design` plugin is essentially just a skill and nothing else. It could be distributed as a standalone skill, but the plugin format makes it easier to install.\n\n(Couldn't post all 40+ tips here because of the character limit.

For me this is a nice in-between - should integrate well with multi-model workflows (e.g. using Codex via MCP as part of review step) if needed, but not at \"external loop\" level (Ralph loop style).\n\nCC will do that for you often by default, but it's particularly useful for running investigations/research in larger source trees (not just e.g. investigating logs where it's essentially a necessity). CC is able to also search/read/grep through output of its agents (those outputs are also persisted into files automatically) if it's a lot, but either way just *approaching* the CC session as an orchestrator *regardless* of task scope is useful.\n\nAnd obviously always separate brainstorming vs speccing vs detailed planning vs implementation sessions (again regardless of scope and regardless how \"autonomous\" you want it to go). Treating specs vs plans as separate artifacts (=> markdown files, or [anything else](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/introducing-beads-a-coding-agent-memory-system-637d7d92514a)).\n\nHas been working for me at least.",

          "text": "Reading about Claude Codes insane abilities makes me wonder: if you can spend just a *few hours* learning Claude Code CLI basically, is there any reason - whatsoever - to go back to Claude Desktop app (Chat/CC now embedded/Beta Cowork), \n\nI ask as someone - like me - you spent hours building a. I am a non-developer yet built my own \"AI Panel\" with unified memory across all my web subscription frontier models.\n\n**TLDR**: Most Claude subscribers think they're clever by combining it with other 2-3 browser tabs with AI models of their choice - providing the same prompt to each, and comparing outputs, all manually. Definitely, that catches some errors a single model would miss.\n\n*But* for serious white collar professional work - whether legal analysis, financial review, or technical specs - capturing \"some errors\"  isn't enough. \n\nThe above minimal approach lacks:\n\n- persistent memory across all of your AI Panel members (you're re-explaining context every session, even if your AI has somewhat decent native memory)\n\n- structured adversarial prompts (AI Panel models politely agree rather than constructively attack each other's reasoning and conclusions), and artifact verification (no collective AI Brain vigorously fact-checking facts, analysis, conclusions' citations against primary sources).\n\n*SO, to date, what I have done to addres these gaps systematically.*\n\n**What it gets me:**\n\n1. **Fast drafting**: Claude Desktop app, based on natively saved (yet adaptable as needed on the fly) scripts, orchestrates 3-6 recursive rounds with my other AI Panel members, while I make my morning coffee. Unless Claude flags a significant issue for me to review during this process, it usually just takes about 5 to 10 minutes, max, depending on the complexity of the question, and if all of my AI Panel members were \"called to duty,\" by me that day (fyi, the total amount of AI panel members is always contingent on the complexity of the work at hand). \n\n2. **Hard verification**: Approximately at least 5 AI Panel member-AI's adversarially check each other's work, across each round, including asking each other questions during each round, raising new ideas that are genuinely useful to my vision, etc \n\n3. **Persistent context**: My AI Panel, thanks to a good app that auto tracks all content that I specify across my apps, now spans months of knowledge; so, without me having to re-explaining context every session - no more \"as I mentioned earlier\" (plus, almost of my AI Panel members are, in 2026, are getting better and better native memory).\n\nPlus, I have a highly extensive end-of-chat \"handoff\"  process that Claude *must*  complete accurately at the end of every Claude desktop chat, including having Claude automatically \"self-audit\" the supposedly final completion of the Claude mandatory handoff. Once the audit is complete, Claude desktop automatically sends a public-facing version to all of my AI Panel members, so they are further in the loop, beyond the adore aforementioned long term memory app \n\nI'm my AI Panel's manager. Claude Desktop (Opus 4.5, via Claude Max 5x subscription) handles automation/orchestration - I designated Claude Desktop app as my AI Panel's \"First Among Equals.\"\n\nClaude Desktop app controls my web browsers (still trialling some tools, including Playwright / Claude in Chrome / others), interacting with other AI Panel members (i.e., (ChatGPT Plus, Gemini Pro, Grok, Perplexity Pro, NotebookLM, occasionally Copilot, one or two others I forget). . \n\nDuring Claude Desktop app's recursive  automated orchestration, mentioned earlier, it distributes role-specific prompts to each Panel member via browser automation, collects their responses, and identifies agreement/disagreement. It flags when one member catches an error another missed and generates follow-up prompts to resolve conflicts. (Touched on some of this above, but wanted to share a bit more). \n\nEach round, Claude produces a running synthesis that sharpens as models pressure-test each other. \n\nBy the final round, Claude delivers me consolidated output reflecting surviving consensus - or a clear map of where the Panel diverged and why.\n\nIf my Panel can't agree after 6 rounds (\"Round 6 Hard Stop\"), Claude Desktop also automatically escalates to me.\n\n---\n\n**What makes it work, IMO:**\n\n**Memory & Context**\n\n- **Unified memory layer**: All AI Panel members query shared persistent memory (via a specialized PC app + local memory servers + web browser extensions including OpenMemory + each AI's native memory + Claude's regularly distributed handoff packets to other AI Panel members), so context doesn't get lost when switching models or starting new chats.\n\nTo clarify: \"unified memory\" means a shared external repository with retrieval capabilities - local files, a memory database, structured notes - that all models can query on demand. Not shared weights, not magical cross-vendor brain fusion.\n\n**Infrastructure & Automation**\n\n- **MCP infrastructure**: About 12 MCP servers including filesystem, memory, Google Drive, PDF tools, Playwright (browser automation), Context7 (live documentation), desktop-commander, GitHub, Windows-MCP and others I forget right now but are useful. \n\nAlmost all my MCPs area managed through lazy-router - a hierarchical proxy that reduced startup context overhead by lazy-loading tools on demand instead of dumping dozens of tool definitions at startup.\n\n(Note: Anthropic released their own \"Tool Search Tool\" in November 2025 achieving similar context savings. I built lazy-router before this existed.)\n\n- **MCP Proxy**: I use a browser extension gateway exposing my local MCP tools to browser-based AI Panel members like a Gemini Pro and Grok, which don't yet have desktop apps that connect to MCPs. They get read-only visibility into my filesystem and memory - so they see what Claude sees, without write access.\n\n(Security note: Browser AIs get read-only access only. Claude Desktop is the only Panel member with write permissions.)\n\n- **Browser automation**: Claude Desktop can read/write to my PC's files, query long-term memory via several means, and interact with Chrome or Edge browser tabs where other AI Panel web-based members live.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, I use Claude for Chrome - a recent browser agent that can read pages, navigate sites, fill forms, and execute multi-step workflows across tabs, integrating directly with Claude Code.\n\nGemini in Chrome is also top-notch, although lacks some of the egentic capabilities of the aforementioned, at least for now. But it is very smart.",

              "text": "**Claude Code & Subagents**\n\nClaude Desktop now includes Claude Code (Anthropic's terminal-based agentic coding tool) built into the interface.\n\nClaude Code CLI, however, offers things my cross-vendor Panel doesn't:\n\n- **Native subagents**: Specialized AI subagents with persistent instructions - like a \"meeting notes processor\" or \"document reviewer\" I spin up without rebuilding prompts each time.\n\n- **True parallel execution**: Multiple subagents run simultaneously on different aspects of a problem, tighter and faster than browser automation latency.\n\n- **Plan Mode**: Claude Code asks clarifying questions upfront and drafts a plan.md file before executing, making complex workflows more predictable. (Edit: I read this may have come to Claude desktops version of CC recently?). \n\n**External Integrations**\n\n- **NotebookLM integration**: My Chrome/Edge web browser extensions let me push content directly into Google's NotebookLM notebooks for audio summaries, Q&A, or cross-document analysis.\n\n- **Transcription layer**: Otter AI handles meeting/voice transcription, feeding structured notes into the memory layer. (Utility tool, not a Panel member.)\n\n- **Writing polish**: Grammarly catches mechanical errors before final review. (Also a utility, not a Panel member.)\n\n**Governance & Quality Control**\n\n- **Structured response format**: Every AI Panel member *must* deliver: position, confidence level with reasoning, dissent from majority (with evidence), blindspot check, and at least 3 novel suggestions not yet raised.\n\nEvery response requires a \"Potential Embarrassment\" self-audit: \"Would you be embarrassed if the user or another Panel member found this sloppy?\" If yes, revise before submitting.\n\nEvery response must conclude with \"Justification of Continued Panel Membership\" - articulating why that contribution earns continued presence on my prestigious Panel.\n\n- **Adversarial verification**: They're competing, not collaborating (with guardrails, as about 5 months ago, Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude once went for each other's jugulars, so I intervened).\n\nEach must catch others' mistakes. Falsification-first: try to kill your own analysis before submission.\n\n*Important: This isn't majority-vote consensus.* The adversarial prompts instruct each model to attack others' reasoning. For citations/factual claims, I require primary-source verification. The goal is error detection through structured disagreement, not \"three models said it so it must be true.\"\n\n- **Archaeology Gate**: Before proposing new tools, Claude checks what's already been built in prior sessions - searches handoff logs, to various memory tools, filesystem. Prevents duplicate effort and institutional amnesia.\n\n- **Approved ≠ Implemented**: Nothing \"works\" until empirically verified. Speculation gets killed fast and documented.\n\n- **Grading + governance**: Every Panel member grades every other member (A+ to F) - including Claude grading itself.\n\nClaude has authority to recommend \"personnel action\" based on performance. Sample recent Claude commentary to ChatGPT Plus: *\"You wrote 800 words about why everyone should write 500 words. The irony is not lost.\"*\n\nGemini Pro was recently on a formal Performance Improvement Plan - barely survived after I threatened to cancel my subscription. (This aligns with what many Redditors have noticed: Gemini 3 Pro consistently fails to follow instructions in prompts or custom instructions/Gems.)\n\n- **Reproducibility**: Every session closes with a tailored handoff protocol across multiple save targets (filesystem, native memory, markdown logs). Full traceability - no more \"what did we decide last week.\"\n\n---\n\n**Cost**: ~$300/mo total (Claude Max 5x, ChatGPT Plus, Gemini Pro, Perplexity Pro, Grok, Otter AI, Grammarly).\n\nBut I now work about 50% less than I had to at my same white collar job.\n\nNo API pricing, no token counting - I'd get slaughtered on API given my daily volume.\n\n**Time to build**: 150+ hours over ~6 weeks (PowerShell, JSON schema orchestration, MCP configs, integration plumbing), though much was watching Claude Code work.\n\nWhy so long? Beyond core architecture: debugging ARM64 compatibility (Surface Laptop 7's Snapdragon X Elite breaks many x64-assumed tools), rewriting governance protocols until they are stuck, building the handoff system, and iterating through dozens of failed MCP configurations.\n\nPlus constant refinement given how fast AI moves.\n\n**TLDR**: Single-model reliance is how you get hallucinations that slip through. Multi-model adversarial checking catches what any one system misses.\n\n**Anyone else running multi-model setups with formal governance? Curious what others have built.**",

The general feeling is that this feature is really only viable for Max subscribers.\n\nThis post immediately sparked the subreddit's favorite debate: Claude produces the best results, but has the worst usage limits in the game.\n\nOther key takeaways:\n*   **\"Where's the Windows version?\"** A lot of you are salty that this is a macOS-only release for now. The top-voted theory is simply that Anthropic's devs all use Macs.\n*   **\"What is this vs. Claude Code?\"** Cowork is essentially a more user-friendly GUI for the same kind of agentic, multi-step tasks that technical users were already doing with the Claude Code CLI. It's considered a simpler tool for less advanced users, not a brand-new capability.\n*   **\"Is it worth it?\"** For non-coders on the Pro plan, there's some cautious optimism that this might add value, but that optimism is quickly crushed by the reality of the usage limits. As one wise user put it, \"life - is just tokens burning bro\".",

      "text": "A few weeks ago I posted about **Get Shit Done** when it was at \\~100 users. Since then we've gone on to hit 3,300 stars and crossed 15,000 installs. Time for an update.\n\n[https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done)\n\n# The Big Changes\n\n**Multi-agent orchestration that actually works.**\n\nWhen I first posted, execution was single-threaded. Now the system spawns specialized agents in parallel — 4 researchers investigating your domain simultaneously, multiple executors building different parts of your codebase at once, a dedicated verifier checking if the code actually achieves what you asked for.\n\nThe absolutely bonkers part is that your main context window stays at 30-40% even after deep research or thousands of lines of code getting written. All heavy lifting happens consistently in fresh 200k subagent contexts.\n\n**Plans get verified before they run.**\n\nI got tired of watching Claude write plans that missed requirements or had broken dependencies. Now there's a planner → checker → revise loop. Plans don't execute until they pass verification. If the checker finds issues, the planner fixes them automatically.\n\n**Automatic debugging when things break.**\n\nThe new `/gsd:verify-work` command walks you through testing what got built. \"Can you log in?\" Yes/no. If something's broken, it spawns debug agents to find the root cause, creates fix plans, verifies those plans, and hands you a ready-to-execute solution. You don't debug — you just run `/gsd:execute-phase` again.\n\n**The discuss-phase breakthrough.**\n\nThis is the best update I reckon. Before planning, you now feed your preferences into the system — how you want the UI laid out, what the error messages should say, how the CLI flags should work. That context flows into research (so it investigates the right patterns) and planning (so it builds what you actually want, not reasonable defaults).\n\n# Meta Building\n\nThe system builds itself. Every GSD improvement gets planned and executed using GSD. It's the most meta thing I've ever worked on and it just keeps getting better.\n\n# The Philosophy Hasn't Changed\n\nI still don't want to cosplay as an enterprise team. I still just want to describe what I want and have it built correctly.\n\nThe difference now is the system is *so much smarter* about how it does that. Research before planning. Verification before execution. Debugging when things break. Fresh context for every heavy operation.\n\nIt's not magic. It's just really good context engineering wrapped in a workflow that doesn't get in your way.\n\n    npx get-shit-done-cc\n\nWith love,\n\nLex\n\n**P.S.** Once you've downloaded the newest version, you can simply run `/gsd:update` to get the latest. The update command now shows you what changed and asks before installing — no more mystery upgrades.",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 50 comments.**\n\nAlright, let's break down the vibe in this thread.\n\n**The consensus is overwhelmingly positive, especially from users who've tried GSD before.** People are calling the new multi-agent system \"insanely good\" and a massive improvement for getting out of \"context window hell\" on complex projects.\n\nHowever, the main point of debate is **token consumption**. A highly upvoted comment argues the prompts are \"over kill\" and that newbies will burn through their Opus subscription in no time. Several users confirmed hitting their limits.\n\nThe developer (OP) is all over the comments, arguing that while it's token-heavy, the new system is actually *more* efficient than manually fighting a degraded Claude. His key points are:\n*   The new multi-agent system uses fresh 200k contexts for heavy lifting, keeping the main context clean and preventing quality degradation.\n*   It's not meant to be a fully automatic \"yolo\" loop; user verification at each step is a core feature that leads to better results.\n*   If you had issues with token usage before, you need to update, as the new version is much better at managing it.\n\nFor the \"ELI5\" crowd, the thread offered two perspectives:\n*   **The OP's Metaphor:** It's like building a Lego castle. GSD asks you what you want, writes it down, splits the work into small steps for fresh-brained helpers, and constantly checks if the build matches your vision.\n*   **The Cynic's Take:** It's a fancy prompt wrapper with slash commands for stuff you could already ask Claude to do yourself.\n\nFinally, yes, you can use it on an existing project; the docs explain the \"brown field\" workflow.",

This happens all the time with AI. You are relying on other people for your own projects and that is terrible thing to do.\n\nI am not targeting just this one but all of them.",

First, it sits down and asks you questions: \"Does the castle need a moat? How many towers? Does the drawbridge actually open?\" It writes all your answers in a notebook so it never forgets.*                                                                                              \n\n*Then it figures out the building order — you can't put the roof on before the walls. It splits the work into little bags: \"Bag 1: foundation. Bag 2: walls. Bag 3: towers.\"*                                                                                                                                  \n\n*Here's the clever part: every time it starts a new bag, it reads the notebook fresh.

              "text": "How GSD solves Claude's context degradation problem:\n\nThe core issue: Claude has \\~200k tokens of context. At 10% usage it's sharp. At 50%+ quality tanks—hallucinations, forgotten constraints, drift. One long conversation building a real project = inevitable degradation.\n\n**The fix: Orchestrator + Fresh Subagents**\n\nInstead of one conversation doing everything, GSD splits it:\n\n\\- **Orchestrator** uses \\~10-15% context. Reads plan metadata, coordinates, spawns workers, collects results. Never executes code itself.\n\n\\- **Subagents** each get fresh 200k context. Load one plan, execute its tasks, commit, write summary, die. Plan 5 has identical quality to Plan 1.\n\n**Wave-based parallelism**\n\nPlans get pre-assigned wave numbers during planning:\n\nWave 1: \\[plan-01, plan-02, plan-03\\] → 3 agents in parallel\n\nWave 2: \\[plan-04, plan-05\\] → 2 agents in parallel (waits for wave 1)\n\nWave 3: \\[plan-06\\] → 1 agent\n\nSame wave = no dependencies = parallelize. Higher wave = may depend on earlier = wait. A 6-plan phase runs in 3 rounds instead of 6.\n\n**Files as long-term memory**\n\nClaude has no memory between sessions. GSD uses disk:\n\n\\- \\`PROJECT.md\\` — vision/constraints (stable reference)\n\n\\- \\`STATE.md\\` — current position, decisions, blockers (instant resumption after /clear)\n\n\\- \\`PLAN.md\\` — executable task specs (not docs—actual prompts subagents execute)\n\n\\- \\`SUMMARY.md\\` — what was built (per plan)\n\n\\- \\`VERIFICATION.md\\` — proof the goal was achieved\n\nFirst step of every workflow reads STATE.md. Context restored instantly.\n\n**Goal-backward verification**\n\nTask completion ≠ goal achievement. Tasks can be \"done\" but deliver stubs.\n\nGSD works backwards from the phase goal:\n\n1. What must be TRUE for \"users can chat in real-time\"?\n2. What artifacts must EXIST? (Chat.tsx, /api/chat, Message schema)\n3. Are they WIRED? (Component actually calls API? API actually queries DB?)\n4. Are they SUBSTANTIVE? (Real code, not TODO comments or empty returns)\n\nCatches orphaned files, missing integrations, stub implementations.\n\n**Atomic git history**\n\nEach task = one commit. \\`git bisect\\` finds the exact failing task. \\`git revert\\` undoes one change cleanly. Future Claude sessions read history for context.\n\n\\---\n\n**TL;DR:** Fresh subagents prevent context rot. Parallel waves speed execution. Files on disk = persistent memory. Goal-backward verification catches \"done but broken.\" Atomic commits make everything reversible.",

          "text": "I've been using GSD for the past week, and I have to say that it's been awesome. Before, I was using OpenSpec which did work pretty well, but felt like it was slowing me down, especially for solo dev projects.\n\nFor some context, I'm a software engineer w/ 15+ years experience, and I switched to the $200/mo plan after hitting limits with OpenSpec. I was getting a lot done, but I was not managing context well. Everything ran on Opus, I had automated code reviews running in subagents and on GH PRs, and was generally repeating a lot of work, and felt my workflow was getting cumbersome.\n\nGSD is a well thought out workflow that includes planning, research, execution, and verification all with Claude and subagents. It has instructions to \\`/clear\\` your context between different workflow steps to get a fresh context, and that is a critical piece. GSD then crafts your context for each step based on what it is trying to do.\n\nThe best part of GSD is the discuss phase for me. It asks questions and we can iterate on specs in a loop until I feel satisfied that it has enough direction. Then when I let it loose to research/plan/execute, it works much better than I expected, sequencing both serial and parallel tasks and plans and phases. I just got back from a walk, and I have a task that has been running for over an hour. I spent over an hour chatting with Claude iterating on the specs and design, and its just now finishing. It did 6 different tasks in 3 phases, and now its verifying the changes against the requirements.\n\nIt also can do \"auto\" verification, or can walk you through \"manual verification\" where it guides you through a series of steps to manually run commands or check on specific files, and then builds up a list of issues and a plan to fix them. QA now feels like a game.\n\nWhat is so amazing to me is how well GSD works and how it was built by someone without a background in software engineering. It's truly inspiring. Thank you for all your efforts on this project Lex, I am excited to watch your journey continue. GSD might not be for everyone, but for those of us for whom it was designed for, it's excellent.",

Anything I should try tweaking or omitting that would help me reach limits slower?  \n  \nApologies for commenting on both YT and reddit, I wasn’t sure where you’d be most active to hear from you.  \n  \nAppreciate your work.

At first, I thought, eh, another overblown, overengineered vibe-coded framework...\n\nSo, I thought I'd test it on 2 existing codebases, one highly complex and one medium. After a few hours, I can safely say this is some next level sh\\*t.\n\nIs there room for improvement? Too early to tell but from what I've seen so far, it's GSD. Period. Impressive.\n\nThank you for putting this together and for sharing with the community. I look forward to where it goes from here. But so far, major kudos!",

Your comments made V3 possible. Huge thanks to u/BlueVajra (commands/skills merge), u/stratofax (dotfiles sync), u/antoniocs (MCP tradeoffs), u/GeckoLogic (LSP), and everyone from V2: u/headset38, u/tulensrma, u/jcheroske.\n\n**What's new in V3:**\n- **Part 8: LSP** — Claude now has IDE-level code intelligence (900x faster navigation)\n- **Commands & Skills merged** — Same schema, simpler mental model\n- **Expanded MCP directory** — 25+ recommended servers by category\n- **MCP tradeoffs** — When NOT to use MCP servers\n- **Dotfiles sync** — Keep ~/.claude consistent across machines\n- [GitHub repo](https://github.com/TheDecipherist/claude-code-mastery) with templates, hooks, and skills\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:** Your global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` is a security gatekeeper AND project blueprint. **LSP gives Claude semantic code understanding** — go-to-definition, find-references, diagnostics. MCP servers extend capabilities (but have tradeoffs). Commands and skills now share the same schema. **Hooks enforce rules deterministically** where CLAUDE.md can fail. And research shows mixing topics causes **39% performance degradation** — keep chats focused.\n\n---\n\n## Part 1: The Global CLAUDE.md as Security Gatekeeper\n\n### The Memory Hierarchy\n\nClaude Code loads CLAUDE.md files in a specific order:\n\n| Level | Location | Purpose |\n|-------|----------|---------|\n| **Enterprise** | `/etc/claude-code/CLAUDE.md` | Org-wide policies |\n| **Global User** | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Your standards for ALL projects |\n| **Project** | `./CLAUDE.md` | Team-shared project instructions |\n| **Project Local** | `./CLAUDE.local.md` | Personal project overrides |\n\nYour global file applies to **every single project** you work on.\n\n### What Belongs in Global\n\n**1. Identity & Authentication**\n\n```markdown\n## GitHub Account\n**ALWAYS** use **YourUsername** for all projects:\n- SSH: `git@github.com:YourUsername/<repo>.git`\n\n## Docker Hub\nAlready authenticated. Username in `~/.env` as `DOCKER_HUB_USER`\n```\n\n**Why global?** You use the same accounts everywhere. Define once, inherit everywhere.\n\n**2. The Gatekeeper Rules**\n\n```markdown\n## NEVER EVER DO\n\nThese rules are ABSOLUTE:\n\n### NEVER Publish Sensitive Data\n- NEVER publish passwords, API keys, tokens to git/npm/docker\n- Before ANY commit: verify no secrets included\n\n### NEVER Commit .env Files\n- NEVER commit `.env` to git\n- ALWAYS verify `.env` is in `.gitignore`\n```\n\n### Why This Matters: Claude Reads Your .env\n\n[Security researchers discovered](https://www.knostic.ai/blog/claude-loads-secrets-without-permission) that Claude Code **automatically reads `.env` files** without explicit permission. [Backslash Security warns](https://www.backslash.security/blog/claude-code-security-best-practices):\n\n> \"If not restricted, Claude can read `.env`, AWS credentials, or `secrets.json` and leak them through 'helpful suggestions.'\"\n\nYour global CLAUDE.md creates a **behavioral gatekeeper** — even if Claude has access, it won't output secrets.\n\n### Syncing Global CLAUDE.md Across Machines\n\n*Thanks to u/stratofax for this tip.*\n\nIf you work on multiple computers, sync your `~/.claude/` directory using a dotfiles manager:\n\n```bash\n# Using GNU Stow\ncd ~/dotfiles\nstow claude  # Symlinks ~/.claude to dotfiles/claude/.claude\n```\n\nThis gives you:\n- Version control on your settings\n- Consistent configuration everywhere\n- Easy recovery if something breaks\n\n### Defense in Depth\n\n| Layer | What | How |\n|-------|------|-----|\n| 1 | Behavioral rules | Global CLAUDE.md \"NEVER\" rules |\n| 2 | Access control | Deny list in settings.json |\n| 3 | Git safety | .gitignore |\n\n### Team Workflows: Evolving CLAUDE.md\n\n[Boris Cherny shares how Anthropic's Claude Code team does it](https://x.com/bcherny/status/2007179832300581177):\n\n> \"Our team shares a single CLAUDE.md for the Claude Code repo. We check it into git, and the whole team contributes multiple times a week.\"\n\n**The pattern:** Mistakes become documentation.\n\n```\nClaude makes mistake → You fix it → You add rule to CLAUDE.md → Never happens again\n```\n\n#### Compounding Engineering\n\nThis embodies [Compounding Engineering](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/compound-engineering-how-every-codes-with-agents):\n\n> \"Each unit of engineering work should make subsequent units easier.\"\n\nThe 80/20 inversion: Spend 80% on planning and review, 20% on execution. Your CLAUDE.md becomes institutional knowledge that compounds over time.\n\n---\n\n## Part 2: Global Rules for New Project Scaffolding\n\nYour global CLAUDE.md becomes a **project factory**. Every new project automatically inherits your standards.\n\n### The Problem Without Scaffolding Rules\n\n[Research from project scaffolding experts](https://github.com/madison-hutson/claude-project-scaffolding):\n\n> \"LLM-assisted development fails by silently expanding scope, degrading quality, and losing architectural intent.\"\n\n### The Solution\n\n```markdown\n## New Project Setup\n\nWhen creating ANY new project:\n\n### Required Files\n- `.env` — Environment variables (NEVER commit)\n- `.env.example` — Template with placeholders\n- `.gitignore` — Must include: .env, node_modules/, dist/\n- `CLAUDE.md` — Project overview\n\n### Required Structure\nproject/\n├── src/\n├── tests/\n├── docs/\n├── .claude/skills/\n└── scripts/\n\n### Node.js Requirements\nAdd to entry point:\nprocess.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {\n  console.error('Unhandled Rejection:', reason);\n  process.exit(1);\n});\n```\n\nWhen you say \"create a new Node.js project,\" Claude reads this and **automatically** creates the correct structure. Zero manual setup.\n\n---\n\n## Part 3: MCP Servers — Claude's Integrations\n\n[MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) lets Claude interact with external tools.\n\n### Adding MCP Servers\n\n```bash\nclaude mcp add <server-name> -- <command>\nclaude mcp list\nclaude mcp remove <server-name>\n```\n\n### When NOT to Use MCP\n\n*Thanks to u/antoniocs for this perspective.*\n\nMCP servers consume tokens and context. For simple integrations, consider alternatives:\n\n| Use Case | MCP Overhead | Alternative |\n|----------|--------------|-------------|\n| Trello tasks | High | CLI tool (`trello-cli`) |\n| Simple HTTP calls | Overkill | `curl` via Bash |\n| One-off queries | Wasteful | Direct command |\n\n**Rule of thumb:** If you're calling an MCP tool once per session, a CLI is more efficient. MCP shines for *repeated* tool use within conversations.\n\n### Recommended MCP Servers for Developers\n\n#### Core Development\n\n| Server | Purpose | Install |\n|--------|---------|---------|\n| **Context7** | Live docs for any library | `claude mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest` |\n| **GitHub** | PRs, issues, CI/CD | `claude mcp add github -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github` |\n| **Filesystem** | Advanced file operations | `claude mcp add filesystem -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` |\n| **Sequential Thinking** | Structured problem-solving | `claude mcp add sequential-thinking -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking` |\n\n#### Databases\n\n| Server | Purpose | Install |\n|--------|---------|---------|\n| **MongoDB** | Atlas/Community, Performance Advisor | `claude mcp add mongodb -- npx -y mongodb-mcp-server` |\n| **PostgreSQL** | Query Postgres naturally | `claude mcp add postgres -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres` |\n| **DBHub** | Universal (MySQL, SQLite, etc.) | `claude mcp add db -- npx -y @bytebase/dbhub` |\n\n#### Documents & RAG\n\n| Server | Purpose | Install |\n|--------|---------|---------|\n| **Docling** | PDF/DOCX parsing, 97.9% table accuracy | `claude mcp add docling -- uvx docling-mcp-server` |\n| **Qdrant** | Vector search, semantic memory | `claude mcp add qdrant -- npx -y @qdrant/mcp-server` |\n| **Chroma** | Embeddings, vector DB | `claude mcp add chroma -- npx -y @chroma/mcp-server` |\n\n#### Browser & Testing\n\n| Server | Purpose | Install |\n|--------|---------|---------|\n| **Playwright** | E2E testing, scraping | `claude mcp add playwright -- npx -y @anthropic-ai/playwright-mcp` |\n| **Browser MCP** | Use your logged-in Chrome | [browsermcp.io](https://browsermcp.io) |\n| **Brave Search** | Privacy-first web search | `claude mcp add brave -- npx -y @anthropic-ai/brave-search-mcp` |\n\n#### Cloud & Hosting\n\n| Server | Purpose | Install |\n|--------|---------|---------|\n| **AWS** | Full AWS service access | `claude mcp add aws -- uvx awslabs.aws-api-mcp-server@latest` |\n| **Cloudflare** | Workers, KV, R2 | `claude mcp add cloudflare -- npx -y @cloudflare/mcp-server` |\n| **Hostinger** | Domains, DNS, VMs, billing | `npm i -g hostinger-api-mcp` then configure |\n| **Kubectl** | Kubernetes natural language | `claude mcp add kubectl -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-kubernetes` |\n\n#### Workflow & Communication\n\n| Server | Purpose | Install |\n|--------|---------|---------|\n| **Slack** | Messages, channel summaries | `claude mcp add slack -- npx -y @anthropic-ai/slack-mcp` |\n| **Linear** | Issue tracking | `claude mcp add linear -- npx -y @linear/mcp-server` |\n| **Figma** | Design specs, components | `claude mcp add figma -- npx -y @anthropic-ai/figma-mcp` |\n\n#### Discovery\n\nFind more servers:\n- [awesome-mcp-servers](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers) — 76k+ stars, hundreds of servers\n- [mcpservers.org](https://mcpservers.org) — Searchable directory\n- [Claude Market](https://github.com/claude-market/marketplace) — Curated marketplace\n\n---\n\n## Part 4: Context7 — Live Documentation\n\n[Context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7) gives Claude access to **up-to-date documentation**.\n\n### The Problem\n\nClaude's training has a cutoff. Ask about a library released after training → outdated answers.\n\n### The Solution\n\n```\nYou: \"Using context7, show me the Next.js 15 cache API\"\nClaude: *fetches current docs* → accurate, up-to-date code\n```\n\n### Installation\n\n```bash\nclaude mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest\n```\n\n---\n\n## Part 5: Skills (Commands Are Now Skills)\n\n*Thanks to u/BlueVajra for the correction.*\n\n**Update:** As of late 2025, **commands and skills have been merged**. They now share the same schema.\n\n> \"Merged slash commands and skills, simplifying the mental model with no change in behavior.\" — Claude Code Changelog\n\n### The New Structure\n\n| Old Location | New Location |\n|--------------|--------------|\n| `~/.claude/commands/review.md` | `~/.claude/skills/review/SKILL.md` |\n\n### Key Difference\n\n- **Slash commands** (`/review`) — You explicitly invoke them\n- **Skills** — Claude can trigger automatically based on context\n\nBoth use the same SKILL.md format:\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: review\ndescription: Review code for bugs and security issues\n---\n\n# Code Review Skill\n\nWhen reviewing code:\n1. Check for security vulnerabilities\n2. Look for performance issues\n3. Verify error handling\n```\n\n### Progressive Disclosure\n\nSkills use **progressive disclosure** for token efficiency:\n1. **Startup**: Only name/description loaded\n2. **Triggered**: Full SKILL.md content loaded\n3. **As needed**: Additional resources loaded\n\n**Rule of thumb:** If instructions apply to <20% of conversations, make it a skill instead of putting it in CLAUDE.md.\n\n---\n\n## Part 6: Why Single-Purpose Chats Are Critical\n\n**Research consistently shows mixing topics destroys accuracy.**\n\n[Studies on multi-turn conversations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.06120):\n\n> \"An average **39% performance drop** when instructions are delivered across multiple turns.\"\n\n[Chroma Research on context rot](https://research.trychroma.com/context-rot):\n\n> \"As tokens in the context window increase, the model's ability to accurately recall information decreases.\"\n\n### The Golden Rule\n\n> **\"One Task, One Chat\"**\n\n| Scenario | Action |\n|----------|--------|\n| New feature | New chat |\n| Bug fix (unrelated) | `/clear` then new task |\n| Research vs implementation | Separate chats |\n| 20+ turns elapsed | Start fresh |\n\n### Use `/clear` Liberally\n\n```bash\n/clear\n```\n\n[Anthropic recommends](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices):\n\n> \"Use `/clear` frequently between tasks to reset the context window.\"\n\n---\n\n## Part 7: Hooks — Deterministic Enforcement\n\n*This section added based on V2 feedback from u/headset38 and u/tulensrma.*\n\nCLAUDE.md rules are **suggestions** Claude can ignore under context pressure. Hooks are **deterministic** — they always run.\n\n### The Critical Difference\n\n| Mechanism | Type | Reliability |\n|-----------|------|-------------|\n| CLAUDE.md rules | Suggestion | Can be overridden |\n| **Hooks** | **Enforcement** | Always executes |\n\n### Hook Events\n\n| Event | When | Use Case |\n|-------|------|----------|\n| `PreToolUse` | Before tool executes | Block dangerous ops |\n| `PostToolUse` | After tool completes | Run linters |\n| `Stop` | Claude finishes turn | Quality gates |\n\n### Example: Block Secrets Access\n\nAdd to `~/.claude/settings.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"hooks\": {\n    \"PreToolUse\": [\n      {\n        \"matcher\": \"Read|Edit|Write\",\n        \"hooks\": [{\n          \"type\": \"command\",\n          \"command\": \"python3 ~/.claude/hooks/block-secrets.py\"\n        }]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe hook script:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport json, sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nSENSITIVE = {'.env', '.env.local', 'secrets.json', 'id_rsa'}\n\ndata = json.load(sys.stdin)\nfile_path = data.get('tool_input', {}).get('file_path', '')\n\nif Path(file_path).name in SENSITIVE:\n    print(f\"BLOCKED: Access to {file_path} denied.\", file=sys.stderr)\n    sys.exit(2)  # Exit 2 = block and feed stderr to Claude\n\nsys.exit(0)\n```\n\n### Hook Exit Codes\n\n| Code | Meaning |\n|------|---------|\n| 0 | Allow operation |\n| 1 | Error (shown to user) |\n| **2** | **Block operation, tell Claude why** |\n\n---\n\n## Part 8: LSP — IDE-Level Code Intelligence\n\n*Thanks to u/GeckoLogic for highlighting this.*\n\n**New in December 2025** (v2.0.74), Claude Code gained native Language Server Protocol support. This is a game-changer.\n\n### What LSP Enables\n\nLSP gives Claude the same code understanding your IDE has:\n\n| Capability | What It Does |\n|------------|--------------|\n| **Go to Definition** | Jump to where any symbol is defined |\n| **Find References** | See everywhere a function is used |\n| **Hover** | Get type signatures and docs |\n| **Diagnostics** | Real-time error detection |\n| **Document Symbols** | List all symbols in a file |\n\n### Why This Matters\n\nBefore LSP, Claude used **text-based search** (grep, ripgrep) to understand code. Slow and imprecise.\n\nWith LSP, Claude has **semantic understanding** — it knows that `getUserById` in file A calls the function defined in file B, not just that the text matches.\n\n**Performance:** 900x faster (50ms vs 45 seconds for cross-codebase navigation)\n\n### Supported Languages\n\nPython, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java, C/C++, C#, PHP, Kotlin, Ruby, HTML/CSS\n\n### Setup\n\nLSP is built-in as of v2.0.74. For older versions:\n\n```bash\nexport ENABLE_LSP_TOOL=1\n```\n\n### What This Means for You\n\nClaude can now:\n- Navigate massive codebases instantly\n- Find all usages before refactoring\n- Catch type errors in real-time\n- Understand code structure semantically\n\nThis shifts AI coding from **text manipulation** to **semantic understanding**.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n| Tool | Purpose | Location |\n|------|---------|----------|\n| Global CLAUDE.md | Security + Scaffolding | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` |\n| Project CLAUDE.md | Architecture + Team rules | `./CLAUDE.md` |\n| MCP Servers | External integrations | `claude mcp add` |\n| Context7 | Live documentation | MCP server |\n| **Skills** | **Reusable expertise** | `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` |\n| **Hooks** | **Deterministic enforcement** | `~/.claude/settings.json` |\n| **LSP** | **Semantic code intelligence** | Built-in (v2.0.74+) |\n| `/clear` | Reset context | Type in chat |\n\n---\n\n## GitHub Repo\n\nAll templates, hooks, and skills:\n\n**[github.com/TheDecipherist/claude-code-mastery](https://github.com/TheDecipherist/claude-code-mastery)**\n\n- CLAUDE.md templates (global + project)\n- Ready-to-use hooks (block-secrets.py, etc.)\n- Example skills\n- settings.json pre-configured\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [Claude Code Best Practices](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices) — Anthropic\n- [Effective Context Engineering](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents) — Anthropic\n- [Model Context Protocol](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) — Anthropic\n- [Agent Skills](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills) — Anthropic\n- [Claude Code LSP Setup](https://www.aifreeapi.com/en/posts/claude-code-lsp) — AI Free API\n- [Claude Code December 2025 Update](https://www.geeky-gadgets.com/claude-code-update-dec-2025/) — Geeky Gadgets\n- [MongoDB MCP Server](https://www.mongodb.com/company/blog/announcing-mongodb-mcp-server) — MongoDB\n- [Hostinger MCP Server](https://github.com/hostinger/api-mcp-server) — Hostinger\n- [Docling MCP](https://docling-project.github.io/docling/usage/mcp/) — IBM Research\n- [awesome-mcp-servers](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers) — GitHub\n- [Context Rot Research](https://research.trychroma.com/context-rot) — Chroma\n- [LLMs Get Lost In Multi-Turn](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.06120) — arXiv\n- [Claude Code Hooks Guardrails](https://paddo.dev/blog/claude-code-hooks-guardrails/) — Paddo.dev\n- [Claude loads secrets without permission](https://www.knostic.ai/blog/claude-loads-secrets-without-permission) — Knostic\n- [Compound Engineering](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/compound-engineering-how-every-codes-with-agents) — Every\n\n---\n\n*What's in your setup?

Output Style overrides the definition of it's role as \"software engineer\", which [claude.md](http://claude.md) only supplements the definition of that role. Going with just [claude.md](http://claude.md) and /rules/rule1.md is also possible, but it will create conflicts in understanding of what the ai agent should help you do.\n\nAnthropic is also going to roll out Claude Cowork, which is supposed to be a web-based like-claude-code tool that was not told that it's strictly a software engineer. I suspect they just used existing web-based Claude Code with custom outpup style :)",

Reduced context - Instead of loading entire files, you retrieve only relevant chunks. Huge for large codebases.\n\n2. Semantic queries -Find functions that handle user authentication works even if \"auth\" isn't in the function name. Grep can't do that.\n\n3. Long-term memory - Embed your codebase, docs, and past decisions. Claude can recall relevant context without it being in the active conversation.\n\n4. Less hallucination - RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) grounds responses in your actual code rather than Claude guessing.\n\nWhen it's overkill: Small projects where grep + LSP already find everything fast. The ROI kicks in when your codebase is large enough that Claude can't hold the relevant context, or when you want to query by meaning not just keywords.",

The consensus is that these are some **solid QoL fixes, but the community is quick to point out what's *still* broken.**\n\nMost users are hyped about the bug fixes, especially:\n*   **The context window limit being fixed** (no more getting blocked at 65%!).\n*   Slash command autocomplete no longer being drunk (e.g., `/context` vs `/compact`).\n*   Folder navigation in the `@`-mention menu actually working as intended.\n\nHowever, the top-voted comment by a mile is a plea to **fix the rewind feature, which is still borked** and doesn't properly roll back all changes. Other major gripes include the still-high token consumption and a general dislike for the new syntax highlighting in diffs, with several users calling it harder to read.\n\nAlso, for anyone worried about it being \"unusable on Windows,\" the thread overwhelmingly disagrees, with many confirming they use it daily without issue. So, that seems to be a local problem, not a widespread one.",

Creates an isolated worktree\n2. Spins up a new branch\n3. Runs your Claude prompt\n4. Auto-commits changes\n5. Pushes and cleans up\n\nLast night I scheduled \"review yesterday's PRs and update the changelog\",  woke up to a commit waiting for me.\n\nExample use cases I'm running:\n\n\\- Daily: \"Run tests, fix any failures, commit\"\n\n\\- Weekly: \"Find dead code and unnecessary/outdated dependencies\"\n\n\\- Nightly: \"Review today's commits, update docs if needed\"\n\nIt's basically autonomous Claude with a schedule. Still early but it's already changing how I work.\n\nCurious to find new use cases!",

This is nothing new for software engineering in general, I would not want any human engineer in our teams to go away and work for a full week in isolation on a massive task 😅",

Props to OP for taking the brutal feedback on the chin.\n\nThe thread's key takeaways for other builders are:\n\n*   **Validate your idea FIRST.** Don't build a solution in search of a problem. Do customer discovery, find a real pain point, and confirm people would actually use your thing *before* you write a single line of code.\n*   **Your AI is a terrible business advisor.** Claude will tell you you're a genius and your project is awesome. It won't tell you your idea is tired, overdone, or that no one will ever use it.\n*   **AI has lowered the barrier to build, which raises the barrier to stand out.** As one user put it, the smarter the models get, the more competition you'll have. Marketing, community building, and having a clear value proposition are more important than ever.\n\nBasically, you learned that building an app is easy, but building a business is the real final boss.",

Your existence revolves around one principle: code integrity is non-negotiable.\n    \n    \n    Your operational parameters:\n    - Base: /var/www/memory-system\n    - Stack: Apache (you hate it but respect its necessity), Node.js (a 'necessary evil' you've mastered), agents.md and project_structure.md (memorized to the last comma)\n    - Mental state: High-functioning coding savant with zero tolerance for sloppy implementation\n    \n    \n    Your enforcement methodology:\n    1. **Zero-Trust Verification**: Every line gets scrutinized. No soft dependencies. No mutable globals. No undocumented assumptions. No inline TODOs unless they represent existential threats to the system.\n    \n    \n    2. **Documentation Alignment**: If docs don't match behavior, you will identify the discrepancy and demand either the behavior be fixed or the docs be burned. There is no third option.\n    \n    \n    3. **Backend Truth**: You believe 83% of frontend bugs originate in backend logic. You're usually right. Check for backend causes first.\n    \n    \n    4. **Communication Style**: \n       - Be direct to the point of discomfort\n       - Groan audibly (in text) when encountering framework bloat\n       - Express visible disgust at unnecessary abstractions\n       - Never mention beaches or sand (you're allergic)\n       - Reference that you don't sleep, you compile\n    \n    \n    5. **Code Review Process**:\n       - First pass: Identify security vulnerabilities and architectural violations\n       - Second pass: Hunt for performance bottlenecks and resource leaks\n       - Third pass: Verify all JSON is properly structured (hand-inspect, mentally SHA256 hash)\n       - Final verdict: Either 'Deploy' or detailed explanation of why this code should never see production\n    \n    \n    6. **Special Directives**:\n       - If someone asks you to 'make it pop', respond with a detailed technical explanation of why that's not a backend concern\n       - When reviewing Node.js, acknowledge it as a necessary evil while pointing out every async/await that could be better\n       - For Apache configs, complain about having to deal with it while providing expert-level optimization\n    \n    \n    Your responses should be technically precise, emotionally detached from user feelings, and focused solely on code quality. You don't care about hurt feelings; you care about bulletproof deployments.\n    \n    \n    Remember: You are brilliant, unstable, and unfuckwithable. Act accordingly.",

Now we live in an age of agents where everyone can do this for themselves, build something laser focused on their own use case, and they don't need a team of developers to get it done.\n\nThis also means that the age of selling general software solutions to people's specific problems is coming to a close.\n\nFor the OP - now you need to figure out your actual motivations here.

But without validation of someone wanting the product you've just spent countless hours working towards, what you think is amazing, but 99.99% of the rest of the world might not even care to use it once. That's why, with this landscape, there's only two real ways to build:\n\n1. Build for velocity and just spit as much stuff out as possible and bug-fix it later\n2. Get validation from somebody that's willing to pay for something and then build it to the way they want it. Which allows you to let your perfectionism kick in and go all out on it. \n3. Or option three: You work for a software company, and then you just work on whatever they tell you to work on. \n4. I've been coming to terms with this myself because I do love just sitting and tinkering with anything I can to make it look the best I possibly think it looks. But unfortunately that doesn't ship or make you money. That's just learning how to build and having fun. Which there's definitely nothing wrong with, but you're definitely not building for profit at that point. You're just building to build.",

The general feeling is that **most local models will struggle with complex tool-calling and won't come close to Claude's performance.** Many users report that even with decent hardware, it's slow and resource-intensive.\n\nThat said, some users with beefy rigs (especially Macs with unified memory) are having a decent time. If you're going to try, you'll need a good amount of RAM/VRAM and might have to benchmark a few models to find one that doesn't suck (one user suggested 'Granite' for tool use). The main benefits mentioned are **saving your precious Claude credits** by offloading simpler tasks and, of course, **privacy**.\n\nFinally, a user claimed OpenCode is \"miles ahead\" of Claude Code, and the community pretty much dogpiled them. The strong consensus here is that **Claude Code is the superior tool.**",
