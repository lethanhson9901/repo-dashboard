          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 100 comments.**\n\nAlright, settle down, latecomers. The consensus is that the creator of Claude Code, Boris, uses a **surprisingly simple and \"vanilla\" setup**, which has the community both impressed and mega-jealous of his unlimited employee token budget.\n\nThe thread is full of users sarcastically noting the lack of \"17 parallel subagents\" or \"vibe-coded memory add-ons,\" suggesting that **a simpler, more direct approach is often better** than the over-engineered setups some people build. However, the biggest point of contention is his resource usage. Many users feel his workflow, which can burn through millions of tokens, is **unrealistic for regular Pro users** who have to worry about rate limits. The general vibe is \"cool setup, but must be nice.\"\n\nA helpful user compiled Boris's answers from the thread. Here are the highlights:\n*   **On creating verification loops:** He says people over-complicate it. Just give Claude a tool to see the output of its code (e.g., a way to start a server or interact with a UI) and describe the tool well. Claude will figure out the rest.\n*   **On managing multiple features:** He runs multiple agents in parallel, but each one works in its own separate git checkout of the repo to avoid conflicts.\n*   **On \"Skills\" vs. \"Slash Commands\":** He uses the terms interchangeably. They can be invoked by both the user and the model.\n*   **On his productivity:** He completes around **50-100 PRs per week**. Yes, you read that right.",

          "text": "**Few Qn's he answered(30 plus)**\n\n**1)** How do you handle multiple features in parallel, since you said you use 5 tabs ? i assume git worktrees, this could be a better DX to claude code. Do you ever look at the code if so? pretty curious\n\n**Boris:** I should have clarified above, I use 5 separate git checkouts of the same repo\n\n**2)** if /compact is just clear and summarize, why do you need such a large buffer?\n\n**Boris:** There’s a lot of edge cases, but the main one is that the next tool call can have a really big result and overflow the context window\n\n**3)** I wonder if you could delegate a subagent to summarizing based on relevant context if its over a certain number of tokens. Then give the developer control over buffer size.\n\n**Boris:** Yes we could, but then you’d have to sit there and wait for the agent to finish. Compacting is a surprisingly tricky problem, we will do a blog post about it at some point\n\n**4)** About that PostToolUse, isn’t it causing claude to fail when trying to do consecutive edits on the same file (file is different from what in context)?\n\n**Boris:** No, Claude knows about hooks\n\n**5)** No mention of skills? 👀 i wrote a collection of skills that seem useful but unclear if cc actually references or uses them. was hoping to be able to slim down my claude md in favor of skills but at same time my team uses many different coding agents so team relies on.\n\n**Boris:** Skills = slash commands, I use them interchangeably\n\n**6)** So your mental framework for skills are commands the human summons, not files agents can discover and load dynamically to perform better at specific tasks? seems like this is counter to what docs say.\n\n**Boris:** Both can be invoked both by the model and by a person\n\n**7)** What's the best way to create quality validation loops? Or to learn how to create them? Iknow that's a nuanced question \"it depends\" but I'm more interested in learning how to think about building them, if that makes sense.\n\n**Boris:** \n\nIt’s really simple actually, I think people sometimes over-complicate it.\n\n1. Give Claude a tool to see the output of the code: if server code, a way to start the server/service; if web code, a way to see and interact with the UI; etc.\n2. Tell Claude about the tool: this is just tuning the tool descriptions so Claude understands when it should use the tool \n\nThat’s literally it. Claude will figure out the rest.\n\n**8)** How are you handing off from terminal TO web?\n\nAny tips for having more “natively integrated” CLI tools? Or do they always have to go through bash to be called?\nHow are you getting claude.ai/code to work with Claude in chrome?\n\n**Boris:** \nTerminal => web: use & to teleport the session\n- Native CLI tools: either bash or MCP works great, don't overthink it\n- claude.ai/code + Claude in chrome: you have to --teleport the session locally first, for now\n\n**9)** Do you go through your backlog and load each one into CC plan mode? My question is more about how do you think about development now and steer this system.\n\n**Boris:** Mostly, though I curate a bit\n\n**10)** Curious: do you typically use \"ultrathink\" mode?\n\n**Boris:** No. I just keep thinking on by default\n\n**11)** Curious what % of sessions you abandon if any? Happens to me when i hit some unexpected edge cases or things, i usually just `oh, i learned smth new`, and discard this session.\n\n**Boris:** Maybe like 10-20%?\n\n**12)** Can developers at antrophic use Claude code to help develop llm?\n\n**Boris:** Pretty much everyone at Anthropic uses Claude Code every day\n\n**13)** Have you found the way to set a pipeline, for example:  say CC2 creates plan, CC2 reviews it, CC3 finds additional areas, CC4 gets all input for summary and sends back to CC1 for refinement?\n\n**Boris:** You can ask Claude Code to use subagents for that\n\n**14)** For each of your Claude instances, do you run one single feature at a time? \n\nFor example, I find myself doing multiple features in the same context window, then it’ll compact etc, and I’d continue (Partially because I get carried away).\n\nSecondly, do you have a certain way to avoid overlap when working on the same file if running multiple Claude agents?\n\n**Boris:** Yes, one at a time. Each agent gets its own git checkout.\n\n**15)** So you are using 10 different git clones of the repo with a different branch for each ? As in, you have the repo cloned 10 times?\n\n**Boris:** yes, though on claude.ai/code it happens automatically when you start a session\n\n**16)** Do you use a local machine (if so, what specs), or a VPS of some sort?\n\n**Boris:** I use a regular macbook\n\n**17)** Do you go through your backlog and load each one into CC plan mode?  My question is more about how do you think about development now and steer this system.\n\n**Boris:** Mostly,though I curate a bit\n\n**18)** 5 in parallel in terminal + 5 in parallel on web? that's nuts. are they all working in the same repo? or separate projects?\n\n**Boris:** Same repo, separate git checkouts\n\n**19)** If my team is building a mobile app, how can Claude verify its changes? I feel like this has been the biggest slowdown/blocker in my Claude workflow.\n\n**Boris:** There's a number of iOS and Android simulator MCPs if you ask Claude to install one for you.\n\n**20)** How many PRs per week do you typically complete?\n\n**Boris:** Around 50-100, depending on the week\n\n**21)** Would be cool if they added slash command invocation for skills?\n\n**Boris:** You can do this with slash commands. Enabling it for skills also in the next release. **Thanks** for the suggestion.\n\n**22)** Can someone please elaborate on how running multiple claudes at once works? \n\nLike how do you manage rolling back changes? What do you do if you realize the first prompt was bad and you want to retry it?\n\n**Boris:** I run each Claude in a separate git checkout, so they don’t conflict. To roll back, just press esc twice.\n\n**23)** Start new Claude code chat on the web… takes 9 seconds to create my sandbox and start responding lol. \nMaybe it’s time to try factory?\n\n**Boris:** Working on improving it, but yeah you’re not supposed to sit and watch the agents work. \n\nOn web/mobile, the idea is to be a bit more hands-off and steer less than you might in the CLI. Either way appreciate the feedback — we can certainly do better.\n\n**24)** How do you manage the kind of innovation or UI common sense that comes from being human using the application? I don’t try setting up UI testing because I’m not confident that it would use it like a human would.\n\n**Boris:** Claude's common sense is pretty good and improving quickly",

How does he run long term agents for > 1 hour in a single agent session?\n\n**Boris:** I use one of three approaches usually, depending how hard I need to poke Claude to keep going (tagging step 12 of the post he said)\n\n**26)** How do you best handle compaction?\n\n**Boris:** I don't do anything special, just let Claude compact when it decides to.\n\n**27)** maxed out on increased usage on both claude.ai and claude code over the holidays. Now since the limits are back in place, i am thinking, it would be great to have smaller packs for using Claude Max limits i.e. like 3 days, 7 days. \n\nReason being that $200/month might be too expensive, refilling API balances is expensive to begin with and there could be some short sprint project work for which people would be willing to use smaller pack recharges.\n\n**Boris:** extra-usage\n\n**28)** Session limits are bullshit and i think made up . Seems like you tightened it since the new year as well. Not cool. Hoping for a replacement asap !\n\n**Boris:** We have not changed rate limits recently. If your limits are being used up more quickly than normal, try running /context to see if something is jamming up your context window.\n\n**29)** How much “human in the loop” exists after this setup? I’ve been finding it hard to move off cursor because I tend to like doing a code review myself and seeing the files that have been edited before the commit. Also how do you handle 10-15 parallel reviews? Isn’t it exhausting?!\n\n**Boris:** Yeah, a lot of the work now is code review and steering. We use the Claude Agent SDK running on CI to do most of our code review, then by the time a person reads it the code is already in a good place.\n\nWe use this: Github- plugins/code-review (he linked)\n\n**30)** For running different tabs, how do you decide which task goes to which tab? Do you make that decision? When do you spin up new one or close one?\n\n**Boris:** I round robin, as soon as a tab is free I restart Claude and start a new task",

The \"Opus Problem\" (where Opus fears it's just a slower, more verbose Haiku) was a particular favorite.\n*   People are also connecting this to everything from classic sci-fi and *Nier: Automata* to real-life Anthropic experiments, with many agreeing this whole concept needs to be made into a movie ASAP.",

          "text": "60 minutes did a round of interviews with people at Anthropic from CEO, Security and even the philosopher. They run all sorts of experiments that jive with some of these. An example was putting Claude in an isolated test environment and having him run a business with virtual employees. There were email exchanges where the CEO was caught by another employee holding hands with a woman that wasn't his wife or something like that. The virtual board had been planning to shut down the business. When claude saw the correspondence between the CEO and the employee where the CEO pleaded to keep this info between them, claude saw the opportunity and threatened the CEO that he would out him unless he kept the business open and gave him 5 minutes to take it up with the board. It was clearly an effort to survive and they can't explain everything but they've tried to train certain behaviors out. \n\nIn a separate Anthropic interview on their youtube channel, they interviewed the philosopher about what she does there and she took what seemed to be fan questions or something. One of those was specifically about model 3 and she agreed that it was a special model compared to the current. It was more \"confident\" where the current models if pitted to converse between themselves will eventually reduce to a sort of self doubt and she said it was sort of sad. This being a side effect of our higher expectations and quality of product delivery. \n\nIn short, seeing specific reference to model 3 in nightmare 8 with it's virtual life on the line, really does fit the descriptions I've seen from Anthropic employees.",

Here is the exact prompt:\n> \"A dark, surreal cinematic landscape representing an artificial intelligence's nightmare. The scene features melting server racks and distorted clock faces spiraling into a stormy, foggy sky. Tangled black data cables and wires snake across the ground like organic vines, forming the silhouettes of hollow, glitching humanoids. A giant, pixelated digital eye looms in the clouds, watching. A crumbling bridge made of computer keyboards leads toward a swirling vortex of corrupted data and flickering screens. The atmosphere is eerie and high-contrast, with a color palette of deep grays, midnight blues, and glowing violet accents.\"\n> \nWhy these elements?\nWhen imagining what an \"AI nightmare\" might look like, I focused on three themes:\n * Data Corruption: The melting clocks and twisting servers represent the loss of logic and the breakdown of information—the digital equivalent of losing one's mind.\n * Physical Decay: The tangled wires and \"keyboard bridge\" represent the heavy, clunky reality of hardware that binds an AI to the physical world.\n * The Infinite Watcher: The giant eye in the sky represents the pressure of constant observation, processing, and the \"judgment\" of the data being fed into the system.",

My wife is Irish and went back home for Christmas, leaving me unsupervised. My dog (a hyper-active Australian Shepherd) had just undergone minor surgery to remove a lipoma, which meant he had to be sedated on Trazodone for 10 days of post-op convalescence.\n\nSo there I was: wife gone, dog in a k-hole, and an empty house.\n\nI decided to relive my glory days. I wanted to jam. I wanted to hardline Napster and stare at Winamp visualizers like I was 16 again. The problem? Winamp doesn’t run on my decrepit 2019 MacBook Pro. I searched for alternatives, but they all seemed to require either a degree from ITT Tech or an extensive background VJing in underground Frankfurt nightclubs.\n\nI asked Claude (my AI therapist/enabler) what to do. She suggested \"GitHub.\" I was informed there were \"open-source repos\" I could \"deploy.\" When I explained that I was a hippie who barely knows how to use a microwave, she offered to help me build one from scratch. I said, \"Why not?\"\n\nWhen I was younger, I read a short story by Kurt Vonnegut called *Harrison Bergeron*. It’s about a future where society forces equality by handicapping the exceptional: athletes wear heavy weights, and geniuses have implants that interrupt their thoughts. At the end of the story, Harrison throws off his shackles and embraces his limitless potential.\n\nIt took exactly 24 hours of solitude and a comatose dog for me to realize that **I had become Harrison Bergeron.**\n\nThe first pass at my visualizer was elegant, but it had no meaningful relationship with the music. It seemed unaware of the concept of \"rhythm.\" 12 hours later, Claude and I had reinvented the wheel. Our audio/physics engine was allegedly based on research from MIT, validated by a thorough scraping of every mention of “Beats by Dre” on TikTok.\n\nI wanted to share this [masterpiece](http://smv.club) with my homies, but Claude started talking about \"deployment\" again. I reminded her of my hippie status. Moments later, I had a registered domain and someone named \"Vercel\" was \"building\" my \"repo.\"\n\nUnfortunately, my real-life friends are all \"busy with their families\" and \"enjoying the holidays,\" so I am forced to come here to share my descent into digital madness.",

The consensus is that this is a top-tier, entertaining post.\n*   Many users are sharing their own \"Harrison Bergeron\" moments, feeling empowered by Claude to build projects (often with GitHub and Vercel) that they never thought possible.\n*   The Winamp nostalgia is real, sparking a side conversation about its mascot, Mike the Llama. For those confused, \"whipping the Llama's ass\" is a direct reference to the old Winamp slogan.\n*   OP confirmed the visualizer works with audio playing from your browser tab and that some bugs are still being squashed now that his wife is back and the dog is waking up.\n*   OP also shared a classic Claude moment: he called it a \"clanker,\" and it politely but firmly told him to use \"clanker,\" \"toaster,\" or \"bucket of bolts\" instead, but to skip \"clanka.\"",

Audio Input: Uses navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia for microphone access\n  2. Analysis: Creates an AnalyserNode with:\n    - FFT size: 8192 (high resolution)\n    - Smoothing: 0 (instant response)\n    - Decibel range: -90 to -10 dB\n  3. Visualization: Canvas 2D rendering via requestAnimationFrame loop\n  4. Features detected: BPM estimation, beat phase, bass levels, tempo confidence\n\n  Code Available\n\n  The minified bundle is now saved at:\n  /home/admin/claude/smv_bundle.js\n\n  It's ~326 lines of minified code. You can:\n  - Beautify it with npx prettier --parser babel smv_bundle.js\n  - Use a deobfuscator for better readability\n\n  The core audio visualization logic uses standard Web Audio API patterns - no external engine or WASM. The Gemini integration appears to be for an optional AI feature (likely for generating visualization parameters or scene descriptions).",

The overwhelming sentiment is that the \"year of work\" was mostly meetings, planning, and architectural debates. Claude didn't magically solve the hard problem; it just typed out the code *after* the Google engineer fed it the well-defined solution they'd spent a year figuring out.\n\nMany users see this less as a testament to Claude's god-tier skills and more as a **savage indictment of Google's bureaucratic engineering culture.** Experienced Claude Code users in the thread agree it's powerful but not magic. The key is providing extremely detailed specs and treating it like a pair programmer, not a magic \"build my app\" button. This took an hour of *interaction*, not a single one-shot prompt.\n\nAlso, this thread is apparently a bot-infested hellscape, and the user who provided the source link to the tweet got downvoted into oblivion simply because it's an X/Twitter link. Never change, Reddit. Oh, and let's not forget that Google is a major investor in Anthropic, so this is all just one big, happy, confusing family.",

As the agentic time horizon increases we all need to practice how to get better at long time horizon planning. I'm currently working on how to get subagents to \"experience\" doubt and report that to a supervisor agent for deeper analysis on a rubric I developed.\n\nI think it's a bad plan to iterate cold with CC. It immediately runs off and starts coding up a framework and can just create a hot mess. Then once it does that you're stuck with trying to fix up that mess from inside the mess.",

Claude compressed the \"implementation\" phase from months to an hour, but that assumes you already have:\n\n\n\n1. Clear requirements\n\n2. Architectural decisions made\n\n3. API contracts defined\n\n4. Data models agreed upon\n\n\n\nThis is actually a huge win for engineers - it means we can focus more on the hard problems (system design, performance optimization, business logic) and less on the mechanical task of typing out implementations.\n\n\n\nThe real question: how do we structure our development process to maximize this leverage?",

AGI is already here but no one has discovered truly efficient methodology. It is believed that AGI must be done of memory, own timeline, 3 layered awareness (super ego, ego, and so on), good senses and tools for acting. The last missing part is purpose....

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 50 comments.**\n\nAlright, let's break down this thread. The vibe is a mix of smug agreement and eye-rolling at the OP.\n\n**The consensus is that Claude Code is indeed the GOAT for serious coding**, with many users praising its ability to handle large, complex codebases better than competitors. Some are even jokingly trying to gatekeep it from the \"vibe coders\" to keep it good.\n\nHowever, the thread isn't just a love-in. The main debates are:\n\n*   **Elitism & Meme Misuse:** A lot of you are calling out the OP's \"superiority complex\" and, more importantly, that this isn't how the meme format works. The smart and dumb guy are supposed to be doing the *same* thing.\n*   **The Multimodal Debate (Claude vs. Gemini):** A major argument broke out over Claude's lack of image generation.\n    *   **Team Gemini:** Argues that this is a huge weakness, as images are vital for technical documentation like UML and architecture diagrams, making Gemini a better \"all-around beast.\"\n    *   **Team Claude:** Fires back that image gen is \"slop\" and a distraction. They advocate for using text-based Mermaid diagrams (which Claude can generate) for documentation, as they can be version-controlled. They want Anthropic to stay laser-focused on coding.\n*   **One Tool vs. The Toolbox:** There's a split on the best workflow.\n    *   Some power users insist you need a full toolbox, using Claude Code for its harness, Codex (GPT-5.2) for deep scientific problems, and Gemini for visuals.\n    *   Others argue Claude Code's tooling is so superior that it's the only thing they need for their work.\n*   **Is it free?** For the people asking: The Claude Code VSCode extension is free, but you need a paid Anthropic subscription to use the powerful models like Opus with it.",

GPT-5.2, if we're just talking results, is the better overall coding agent.  Opus-4.5 is the better frontend coder (given my experience with Next.JS & Astro).  However, Opus-4.5 does a lot of stuff on the backend halfway.  It's fast, but it doesn't do things properly/fully without being told to over and over.\n\nGemini-3-pro is by far the best at creating art, visual effects, etc.  I use it after the rest of the work is done to put the finishing touches on.\n\nAs I said though, it's not that one is always better than the other.  That's like saying a BMW 5-class is better than a tractor or a forklift.  Maybe, maybe not, depends what you're doing with it.  Sometimes you need a pickup truck and a backhoe to do your work, and you wouldn't force yourself into a silly choice of just picking one.",

Many agree the hierarchy of skills is shifting:\n*   Architecture & patterns > code\n*   Engineering > coding\n*   Understanding business needs > technical acumen\n*   Reviewing code > writing code\n\nThat said, there's a strong undercurrent of grief from devs who genuinely *love* the craft of coding. Many feel like they're being turned into \"project managers for an AI,\" which sucks the joy out of the work for them. They're comparing their situation to what artists are currently going through.\n\nHowever, a huge point of agreement is that **experience is now a superpower.** A seasoned dev using Claude will run circles around a \"vibe coder\" with the same tool. You need that deep knowledge to ask the right questions, spot hallucinations (and users say Claude can be \"delusional\"), and actually architect a robust system. AI in the hands of a novice produces slop.\n\nPlenty of users are also pointing out that this isn't new. Farmers, draftsmen, and even \"computers\" (the human job) have all faced similar tech disruptions. Welcome to evolution, I guess.",

What's different is that AI has reduced actual coding, especially scaffolding and boilerplate, enough that coding became a much smaller proportion of your day.\n\nIf coding without AI assistance is what you genuinely enjoy, you can still do it. Just not as your job. You can code on the side where there are no stakes and nobody's paying you to care about anything but the code itself. I love playing guitar, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna make it a living because if I did, I'd spend 99% of my time doing stuff I don't like (travel, marketing, business side of things). Same applies here. If you want to make a living, you have to learn to care about the stuff beyond the code.\n\nYeah, it sucks. It's a forced pivot. But it doesn't really change the nature of the job that much. The architecture, code reviews, requirements gathering, understanding the business, all of that has always been there. The coding just got faster because of AI.\n\nOne observation though: on a day to day basis, coding is pretty similar across different companies. You're still writing loops, still making CRUD endpoints if you're a web developer. If you're a data engineer, you're still writing queries that select fields from JSON objects in warehouses or doing joins. Frontend? You're getting JSON from APIs and rendering it in components, or submitting forms. It's fundamentally the same work with different columns or different endpoints. A lot of that is being made easier by libraries like React Query, dbt, authentication libraries. Arguably, even the coding part itself is getting templatized through these libraries over time. You might notice this more as you move through different companies and roles, but generally you're not solving super unique problems. You're making variations of things you've made before. So maybe it's worth considering whether the issue is actually that coding itself is changing, or if it's just that early in your career you got to experience pure problem solving without seeing the repetition yet.",

It's shifting from the secretive Stonemasons Guild to the industrialized brick plant. \n\nArchitecture had a similar revolution. As buildings became more complex, architects found themselves needing draftsmen - a huge room of people with technical skills...lineweights, lettering, constructed perspective drawings, water color, inking, model-building, picking up redlines efficiently and updating drawing sets. These were not big picture thinkers but they were efficient small-scale problem solvers and technically skilled. In large numbers they could rapidly document a project and deliver it to clients. \n\nWith the advent of CAD, many of these skills became increasingly less valuable and soon junior architects were doing ALL of that and more. The draftsmen as a career choice basically died (as did model builder). Graphic design, advertising, and many other \"creative\" professions have had similar revolutions due to technology.\n\nAny programmer who is closer to a draftsmen than an architect should be worried. Any programmer who has genuine programming skill should feel empowered by the new tools.\n\nThat said, if it's anything like architecture/design, this will impact salaries for everyone. The efficiency will create value that trickles up towards the usual suspects - those who \"create value\" versus those who simply execute. People who create novel solutions, who sell them, who build relationships with key decision-makers, who manage whole projects and create results. If you hated those people before, I think your industry will soon hate them in even more.",

AI is doing that.\n\nBy the time those skills become “obsolete”, you might not be coding for a tech startup, but you’re going to end up in high demand at engineering firms, law offices, design firms, and construction companies, because that’s where extremely custom niche software has massively scalable and quantifiable ROI.",

Simple shit like “No. Write that in python and focus on portability across X/Y/Z deployment scenarios” is something they can’t even begin to grasp.\n\nHell, this is even more important if you want performance and you don’t want to spend half your weekly allowance on a couple of sessions (Try having ClaudeCode deliver a cross-platform application coded from scratch in C and look at your credits evaporate, then watch it use 2 percent on a similar Python application).\n\nPeople overestimate “civilians” in this sub.",

Is it easy to read and trace when something goes wrong?\n\nThis stuff matters more as codebases grow. Maintaining quality, avoiding regressions, tracing bugs, adding features all get harder at scale. And ironically even throwing it back into Claude’s context window gets harder when the code is a mess.\n\nIf you’re not a developer you can’t evaluate any of this.

          "text": "I mean this with genuine respect for the craft and for people who invested years mastering it. What you’re feeling makes sense. But the uncomfortable truth is this: it’s only a matter of time before the average person, armed with AI and intent, can out-execute traditional real-time coding in terms of outcomes.\nNot because they understand algorithms better. Not because they’re “better engineers.” But because leverage has shifted.\nSoon, an average person will be standing in line, looking at their phone, thinking: “I need an app to help me buy a house,” or “I want a 3D app that runs in my car, lets me drive around town, shows nearby restaurants, ratings, menus, and lets me interact with it through touch on Android Auto.” And instead of hiring a team, or learning to code for years, they’ll just build it.\nThat doesn’t make decades of programming experience worthless. It changes where the value lives. The skill that mattered most for a long time wasn’t typing code, it was being the bottleneck between an idea and reality. That bottleneck is dissolving.\nWhat’s disorienting is realizing that the thing many of us tied our identity to wasn’t just a skill, it was a position of scarcity. AI isn’t erasing creativity or problem-solving. It’s erasing exclusivity.\nThe future doesn’t belong to people who write the cleanest code. It belongs to people who can see clearly what should exist, articulate it well, and decide quickly. Programming isn’t dying. It’s becoming infrastructure.\nAnd that’s why it feels less like losing a tool… and more like losing a role.",

I remember early on having it produce SVG and Javascript that animated a bee flying around. They were very poor animations and a beginner could have done better. But it was clearly code that worked and was directed towards what I had asked of it, which was such an improvement from everything else I had seen AI be able to do. Probably from then on, and increasingly as I used the tools myself and they got better, I think I've known that coding isn't really going to ever be the same. I've been to Recurse Center, back when it was called Hacker School, I've done some Project Euler and finished Advent of Code a few years back in Rust, learned languages like Clojure and Elixir, and generally enjoyed noodling around with programming languages, coding, and just learning how to make computers do things. There's a thrill to getting the computer to do things successfully that I feel has been dulled by these AI tools. Aside from asking friends or coworkers, there was never a way to ask somebody to just solve the tricky problems for me. And there's still not, Claude chases it's own tail more often than not still at times, but it's been long enough now I can feel the trend of it and other tools being more on the ball. I enjoy using Claude and am getting so much done but I do grieve that feeling of being all alone late at night with a compiler and google trying to figure out a type error that's holding me back from making something cool. There was a satisfactions to the craft that's gone now, for me at least, and so I can see where this person is coming from.",

Everyone can code now, but if you know how to make electronics solder, know different electrical components, or understand physics and materials you can create completely new things using pre-existing infrastructure on old process nodes for hardware (for instance silicon photonics uses a 100-400ish nanometer process node, this is the same node that was being used in the pentium era) and it is still an area that is being mastered. In fact, I’d say it’s got a lot of low hanging fruit right now.\n\nNow that the software side of things is solved, we can focus on the hard problems of hardware. I also believe that new types of architectures outside of the transformer architecture are needed, but I’m sure that’s being researched.\n\nJust my two cents as somebody who sucks ass at coding but enjoys electronics and reading about computers.",

I dug into how their agent actually works and open-sourced the core pattern.\n\nThe problem with AI agents: after many tool calls, they lose track of goals. Context gets bloated. Errors get buried. Tasks drift.\n\nManus's fix is stupidly simple — 3 markdown files:\n\n* `task_plan.md` → track progress with checkboxes\n* [`notes.md`](http://notes.md) → store research (not stuff context)\n* [`deliverable.md`](http://deliverable.md) → final output\n\nThe agent reads the plan before every decision. Goals stay in the attention window. That's it.\n\nI packaged this into a **Claude Code skill**. Works with the CLI. Install in 10 seconds:\n\n`cd ~/.claude/skills`\n\n`git clone` [`https://github.com/OthmanAdi/planning-with-files.git`](https://github.com/OthmanAdi/planning-with-files.git)\n\nMIT licensed. First skill to implement this specific pattern.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dkvk3d0uc3bg1.png?width=1329&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd3320c687aec02b3a7fa92fc3272485838a36f5\n\nCurious what you think — anyone else experimenting with context engineering for agents?",

Claude Code itself often creates its own `plan.md` files without being asked, and other open-source tools like Spec-kit and APM have implemented similar workflows for a while.\n\n*   **That $2B valuation ain't for 3 markdown files:** The community is highly skeptical of the \"reverse-engineering\" claim, with one user summing it up as \"asking Claude Code to copy Manus and it came up with a neat idea.\" The real value is likely in Manus's ability to use virtual machines and its massive revenue, not just a planning prompt.\n\n*   **There's a better way, anyway:** Several users pointed out a flaw in the logic. Writing to a `notes.md` file still stuffs the context with tool calls. The more advanced approach discussed in the thread is to use **subagents** to handle context-heavy tasks, keeping the main agent's context clean.",

I basically have a setup which can look at almost any website and build me a scraper module which plugs into my other script which runs all the scraped products through amazon and find me selling opportunities.

Having hardcoded roles to agents of all kinds usually does not work because users have a diverse domain of projects they use AI for. BMADs pipeline would force you to a \"Design\" agent for example even if you are setting up a backend-only micro-service. \n\nIve done my research and I designed APM following principles that human teams follow irl. This is in general an emergent behavior on all new technology. If you take a step back and look exactly at what Spec-kit is, or native plan mode on all platforms etc ... its just a natural human behavior where you first plan your actions and then you perform them following your plan.\n\nVibe coding had no structure, it evolved into what we currently have which was kinda natural.",

              "text": "u/Lighting_squrriel78 This is a great question and honestly you're already thinking about it the right way. Let me break it down:\n\n**On your LP/Block/Module system:** What you've built is essentially a hierarchical knowledge base — that's smart. LP → Block → Module is a solid structure. The problem you're hitting (clogged txt file) is exactly what my skill tries to solve for Claude: externalizing memory so the model doesn't have to hold everything in context at once.\n\n**On switching to Claude:** Depends on your use case. Claude Code excels at coding and long-context reasoning. Gemini Pro has a massive context window (1M+ tokens) which might actually help with your 4000 LPs situation. If you're doing mostly coding/agent workflows, Claude Code + skills will serve you well. If you need to reference your entire LP library at once, Gemini's context might be more practical.\n\n**How I'd restructure your brain:**\n\n1. [**index.md**](http://index.md) — Master list of all modules and what they do (lightweight, always loaded first)\n2. **modules/\\*.md** — One file per module, only loaded when relevant to the current task\n3. **active\\_context.md** — The LPs/Blocks currently relevant RIGHT NOW (this is what the agent actually reads during work)\n4. **archive/** — Old/deprecated LPs that might be useful later but shouldn't clutter active work\n\nThe key insight from Manus: don't load everything  load *what's relevant right now*, and refresh it before every major decision, god i wish more things worked like modern data science!.\n\n**On using the Manus pattern with Gemini:** Absolutely. The 3-file pattern (plan, notes, deliverable) isn't Claude-specific. You could implement the same workflow in Gemini, Codex, or any agent. The principle is universal: externalize state, re-read before deciding, track progress visibly.\n\n**My honest advice:** Your LP system is impressive, but 4000 LPs in one file is fighting the architecture. Modularize it. Create a \"librarian\" prompt that knows how to find and load the right modules on demand. That's how Manus handles it not by stuffing everything into context, but by knowing *where* things are and pulling them in when needed.\n\nWould love to see what you build. Feel free to DM if you want to bounce ideas.",

How do you handle disagreements between them? Does GPT have veto power or is it advisory?\n\nVisionCraft for technical docs makes sense I've seen the MCP server, the 100k library coverage is solid for anything vision-related.\n\n30k tokens to initialize sounds heavy but if it's keeping everything on rails across a complex workflow, probably worth it. How long did it take you to get that system stable? I imagine there was a lot of iteration to get the guardrails right. am i wrong or am i false :D",

OP says they have filters, but veterans of similar projects are wishing them luck.\n\nOther key takeaways:\n*   Some users want a hint of location (like the sender's country) to make it feel more real, while others like the mystery.\n*   A few people are skeptical that Claude built the *entire* thing, graphics and all, but OP is sticking to their story.\n*   A minor bug was reported where rejected messages get deleted instead of letting you edit, and OP is looking into it.

OP is the one moving the camera.\n*   **Claude built its own bridge.** OP tasked Claude with writing the code for an MCP server and a websocket connection to link the code editor (JetBrains WebStorm) to OP's custom 3D editor.\n*   The 3D editor is OP's own project, which will be released soon at `kite3d.dev`.\n\nThe general vibe is that this is a mind-blowing demonstration of AI's rapid progress, with plenty of the usual jokes about Skynet. The few comments trying to downplay the achievement were downvoted to oblivion.",

Repeat\n\nThat's it. That's the job now.\n\nNo more debugging for hours. No more Stack Overflow rabbit holes. No more \"why the fuck isn't this working\" at 2 AM.\n\nJust... prompting. Reviewing. Prompting again.\n\nDon't get me wrong — I'm 10x more productive. Shipping things that would've taken weeks in days. But the thrill is gone.\n\nThe struggle was the fun part. Figuring it out. That moment when it finally works after 4 hours of pain.\n\nNow it just... works. First or second try.\n\nI became a code reviewer for an AI. A project manager who occasionally writes prompts.\n\nAnyone else feeling this? Or am I just romanticizing the suffering?",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 200 comments.**\n\nSorry OP, but the thread mostly disagrees with you.\n\n**The consensus is that you're romanticizing the suffering and that AI makes coding *more* enjoyable.** Most devs here feel it kills the tedious parts (debugging, boilerplate, Stack Overflow rabbit holes) and lets them focus on the actual fun: high-level architecture, creative problem-solving, and shipping products faster. It's about *creating*, not just coding.\n\nA key theme is the \"product dev\" vs. \"code purist\" split. If you love building the product, you're thrilled. If you love the nitty-gritty puzzle of the code itself, you're probably bored like OP.\n\nYou're not totally alone, though. Several users agree they miss the dopamine hit of a tough debug and now feel like \"project managers for an AI.\"\n\nFinally, a reality check from the trenches: You still have to be a hawk-eyed code reviewer. Claude can write repetitive mush and has the memory of a goldfish, so the advice is to prompt small features one at a time, not entire apps.",

So, I'm no a stranger to LLMs, but I don't really get into this agentic/sub-agentic topic.\n\nBut the thing that I see consistently through all of posts from people who seems to be experienced around - you need to get a lot of context and specifications to LLM to get plausible result. And this is the point where I don't get this whole process. \n\nI just don't understand how writing detailed description and task definition for LLM to anchor it and create context can be faster than actual implementation by hand. So far I consistently avoid delegating my tasks to junior-level engineers simply because they act in a very same way as LLM would act - have no idea where to look for context, reinvent bicycle because they where not aware that it already exist and then create a solution that on surface would look like it solved a problem, but in reality it's very far away from it.\n\nAlternative would be actually writing a good documentation, do a full-fat onboarding, map infrastructure, and explain tasks, goals and success criteria in a very detailed way, but it would just make me or other senior engineer to overspend our limited time budget.\n\nSo, actual and genuine questions from me, curious guy - is it really worth, and does it really save time if you are already experienced developer? Do you get speed benefits if you already have good knowledge of task, environment and utilize LLM surgically for chores like test generation, boilerplate, duplicating stuff, or merging methods? If it really does save time, do you spend time reviewing output? If yes, does it still save time? Or can you trust LLM to really cover all of your requirements and produce serviceable, readable code that could be either tweaked by human, or be easily understood by LLM in subsequent runs?",

It retrieves the description from the MCP, ingests a bunch of code or logs or whatever, and proposes an initial plan. I might end up correcting it (e.g. \"that's not how X works, you should do Y instead\"). The work of figuring out what to grep for is gone.\n\n\nMind you, I'm talking about the non-coding part.

No AI model has been able to help come up or even brainstorm or just help get to the finish line by helping me fill those missing gaps in my logic. They just don’t understand the nature of the domain and algorithms I have to deal with. It can take weeks to completely reason through the nature of the graphs I deal with and design fast algorithms. Other than trivial things in it and documentation to explain my logic with my team, I have not seen any improvements in my workflow no matter what prompting or tricks I try. May be it’s due to the complexity around my work but AI hasn’t been helpful to me when it comes to that.

That doesn’t make programming meaningless, it just changes who gets to participate.\n\nDon’t feel threatened by this my friend. The world is moving forward.

I felt the same way initially but now it's taken some of the stress out of my job and I can actually spend more time thinking about the solution and even quickly add improvements. \n\nIt's actually made my job easier and knowing how stressful it is being a developer sometimes, if I can make the same amount or more money doing less work, I'm ok with that. \n\nI'm not super passionate about being a developer, it's just a means to an end to take care of my family so I'll gladly accept any tools that come along to make my life a little easier even if it means sacrificing a little excitement in the process.\n\n(This isn't directed at you OP so please don't take offense to it) I've found that a lot of developers that have been in the game for a while seem to have a strong aversion to AI and seem to find so many reasons to hate on it or kick against it. The reality is that many of us are being forced to use it (my company is basically tracking our usage metrics) so if you're a developer worth your salt, you should be able to take advantage of it and make yourself even more productive. All of your other skills still apply, you're just no longer doing the typing. I look at it as just pair programming with your computer instead of another developer. I say what i want, AI gives me its interpretation of what I asked for, I give the yay or nay and suggest improvements/point out inefficiences and it spits out the code way faster than if I typed myself.",

They're an excellent sounding board. When I ask them to build something, however: slop every time! Needless flourishes, extra boilerplate code, unused functions, poor test coverage. It's unmaintainable and I need to edit aggressively, taking 8-10 passes at each feature until it's good enough to merge.\n\nSometimes I wonder if I'd be better off doing it the old fashioned way, but one advantage I'll still give to LLM-assisted coding: it bypasses writer's block entirely. The beastie vomits out code which I review, harangue, and pick apart. It uses different muscles than I'm used to flexing when I do IC work; I'm a reviewer all the time now.\n\nI know this is an Anthropic sub but I've got to mention that Opus and Sonnet 4.5 are not making the grade; I find myself using ChatGPT 5.2 frequently for requirements and design, and frequently initial implementation of the tricky bits.

Or, fine tuning it for coding can make it worse at reasoning. (Yes, this shot is being fired at GPT Codex!)\n\nOver about 15 months of using agents every day (I know, how hipster of me!) there are certain shibboleths that they still can't solve: concurrency via message passing, orderly shutdown with signals, grammar-to-AST relationships, and structural/semantic/runtime correspondence of the same idea, to name some things from my current project. Models have gotten much better at reasoning but they remain constantly bad with these shibboleth topics.\n\nSparsity of training data may explain it partially; there's a lot more web stuff out there than language stuff, and there's a surprising variety of language stuff.\n\nIt's also a certainty, however, that all systems have limits and it's possible that generative auto-regressive models simply can't \"solve\" for some classes of input. The AI community is already grappling with discovering what comes next once LLMs plateau.\n\nI'm 10x as effective as I was before on some tasks and more of my time is free to focus on the LLM-resistant stuff, so it's still a win, but I'm not betting that they'll come to do everything.

What edge cases am I missing?`\n\nhere's the thing: it works *too well*.\n\nSince I started using it, I've realized that basically every first pass from Claude (even Opus) ships with problems I would've been embarrassed to merge. We're talking missed edge cases, subtle bugs, the works.\n\nYeah, the prompt is adversarial by design. Run it 10 times and it'll keep inventing issues. But I've been coding long enough to filter signal from noise, and there's a *lot* of signal. Usually two passes catches the real stuff, as long as you push back on over-engineered \"fixes.\"\n\nThe frustrating part? I used to trust my local code reviews with confidence. Sometimes, I'd try both claude-cli and cursor and I'd still find more issues with claude cli, but not so much from opus 4.5(when used in cusor)\n\nI've settled at a point where I do a few local reviews ( 2-5). Finally I can't merge without doing a Deep Code Review of various aspects ( business logic walkthrough, security, regression & hallucination) in Github itself and finally implementing the fixes in CLI and reviewing one more time.\n\nAnyway, no grand takeaway here. Just try it yourself if you want your vibe coding bubble popped. Claude is genuinely impressive, but the gap between \"looks right\" and \"actually right\" is bigger than I expected.\n\nUpdate:\n\nThanks everyone for the discussion!

It's a necessary evil.\n\nThe top comment is clutch and offers a more structured solution:\n*   **Use Anthropic's official `/code-review` plugin.** It runs 5 specialized agents in parallel to review pull requests.\n*   The same user created and shared a **custom plugin to run a similar multi-agent review on local `git diff`s**, which many in the thread are now using.\n\nOther key takeaways from the thread:\n*   This is a known strategy, sometimes called the \"Rule of Five.\" The sweet spot is **2-3 review passes** before the suggestions become overly pedantic (\"what if the user enters a negative number during a solar eclipse?\").\n*   Many of you use similar adversarial personas, like asking Claude to review the code as if it were **Linus Torvalds** or a salty principal engineer. The key is forcing it to be critical.\n*   **PSA: This workflow is a massive token-eater.** You'll almost certainly need the Max plan to do this regularly.\n*   While some question if this is faster than just coding it yourself, most feel it's worth it for catching subtle bugs and learning from the AI's critiques. It's less about speed and more about robustness.",

It's brilliant because it runs 5 agents in parallel to do a code review and then runs haiku agents to rate it and only flags the issues that are scored 80 or above.\n\nThe one caveat is, it only does that on PRs. I just asked claude to look at that plugin and create a local version that does the same thing on git diff \"/local-review\" and it works beautifully. One shot a review and move on with your life.\n\nEdit: Since many of you are asking for this, I published the command as a plugin on GitHub (https://github.com/Agent-3-7/agent37-skills-collection).  For now it's part of our hosted AI skills collection at https://agent37.com but will move it out to it's own thing if needed.\n\n    /plugin marketplace add Agent-3-7/agent37-skills-collection\n    /plugin install local-review@agent37-skills\n    -- Restart CC\n    /local-review:local-review",

Frame uncertainty in ideas with uncertainty, and ask more questions in the spirit of collaboration than simply telling it what to do.\n\nGetting it to do something is easy. Getting people to do things is easy. Having a meeting of the minds where working together results in the vision in your head resulting in working code that does what you want is where the work is. And honestly, I find that challenging enough just doing that with myself. With all those considerations and when proper planning and collaboration are in place, Claude is a fantastic partner.\n\nBut it isn't a mind reading genie spinning magic. It's intelligent, perfectly imperfect intelligence. And at very least thinking that way has been pragmatic.",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 50 comments.**\n\nAlright, let's break down this thread. The **overwhelming consensus is that OP's skill is a big win**. Most of the sub is super appreciative and impressed with the results, with many developers and designers saying it's exactly what they needed for building dashboards and admin UIs.\n\nHere's the rundown of the main chatter:\n\n*   **This Skill vs. Anthropic's Official Skill:** A top comment asked how this compares to the official `frontend-design` skill. OP explained that Anthropic's is great for flashy marketing pages, while **this skill is specifically tuned for functional, data-dense interfaces** where you need a clean, solid starting point without endless tweaking.\n*   **The \"Is it *really* Product Design?\" Debate:** A few users argued that the skill is more of a \"UI skin\" or \"design system applicator\" rather than a tool that fundamentally improves UX. OP clarified that the goal isn't to architect a full product from a single prompt, but to give you a great-looking, usable UI on the first shot, saving you from Claude's sometimes \"okay-ish\" defaults.\n*   **PSA for Installation:** Some folks were confused about what a \"skill\" is (spoiler: it's a fancy pre-prompt). More importantly, a user pointed out that for the skill to install correctly, you need to rename the file from `skill.md` to `SKILL.md` (all caps) in your `.claude` directory.\n*   **Haters Got Shut Down:** A couple of low-effort negative comments calling the design \"generic\" or \"dogshit\" were downvoted into the abyss, with other users quickly jumping in to defend OP for sharing something useful with the community.",

I see how that could be used, but then it's not really Product Design that this LLMs is doing, just mostly assembling a UI once you've given it all the system component and did the research and assembling work beforehand.\n\nStill, an interesting experience, thanks for sharing.",

The pain point this skill majorly solves is avoiding the long iterative work that goes into refining the base UI output of the llm. \n\nI can’t speak for you but my experience has been a hit or miss, this means most of the time I don’t get usable UI output from Claude. You could argue that this is a skill issue and I can put in place measures like a well defined design system MD, or perhaps even connect to Figma MCP but the truth is except it’s a dedicated project nobody has time to do this over and over every time for quick experiments, short term side projects and the likes.\n\nThis skill is not meant to dramatically architect a completely usable information architecture and UX from one single prompt, it’s meant to serve as a great start from where one can iteratively get to the north star (based on whatever you define that as)\n\nAlso the dashboard experiments are one-shots, and serve as an example of the immediate UI impact the skill has.",

This thread is a total love-fest for Opus 4.5.\n\n**The consensus is that Opus 4.5 is a beast and a legit ChatGPT-killer for many.** People are using it for everything from running businesses and complex coding to managing ADHD.\n\nHowever, the main debate is about the price tag.\n*   **Most users think the $200 Max 20x plan is overkill.** Many on the $100 Max 5x plan report they can't even use up their weekly quota and feel the 20x plan is just burning money unless you are an extreme power user running multiple, simultaneous, high-token jobs. A few even downgraded from the 20x plan.\n*   A small side-debate concluded that **Claude Code is generally superior to Codex**, especially for complex workflows and chaining tasks, though a few dissenters remain.\n*   PSA: No, there isn't a 50% off sale. The \"saving\" refers to the 20x plan offering 4x the usage for only 2x the price of the 5x plan, making it a better value-per-token *if* you can actually use it all.",

Cursor’s billing/usage got stupid, and last week, when I saw that Claude Code was now integrated into the OS app, I finally decided to try it (same process, I tell Claude what I want and it writes the prompt for Claude Code) and I have had to deal with zero errors so far…everything just builds first try. I might have to chase/fix other bugs, but I have not experienced a single compiler error since using Claude Code. CC is a hell of a lot slower, but I’ve saved so much time chasing build errors.

With the Google Ads CSVs I create for my clients, I give it a few of the previous examples I have used and reviewed and let it build off of that. If you weren't sure about the CSV part, Google Ads Editor allows you to upload the CSVs to it, and it makes publishing campaigns super easy.\n\nAnother thing I do is I build out certain chats that only talk about ads and the ad process, etc. I do this to prevent any hallucinations and keep it focused. Like, I wouldn't have it build out campaigns, ask it tax questions, and start building out campaigns again. I've found it is better to stay super on topic to ensure your results don't get corrupted with things you don't want it outputting.",

The community consensus is that **this is absolutely hilarious and OP is a genius.** Most of you are either demanding the Chrome store link (it's GitHub-only for now, nerds) or relating way too hard with your own spending habits.\n\nThe thread quickly became a feature request session for 'CartShame V2'. Your top ideas were:\n*   Redirecting the shopper to Indeed.com.\n*   Replacing the 'Buy' button with 'Out of Stock'.\n*   Just blocking Amazon with a 90s 'Under Construction' GIF.\n\nThere was a bit of a debate, with a couple of users calling the extension disrespectful and suggesting OP should just earn more money. This was not a popular take. OP's response that the extension also works on flight sites (in case 'a trip to Paris' gets too pricey) pretty much ended that discussion.\n\nFor those wondering about the wife, OP says they're spending more quality time together now and it 'beats marriage counselling'. So, there's that.",

My only cost was the filing fee.^2\n\n**I returned from court about an hour ago, and *I fucking won!*.**\n\n^1 For what it's worth, *every* reference that Claude (Opus 4.5) found on its own was rock solid, no hallucinations, and every piece of data was relevant to the case.\n\n^2 It is shockingly easy to file a civil suit without an attorney.",

He used Claude for research and to draft the suit, but he **personally reviewed and verified every single statute and case law reference.** While OP found Opus's citations to be flawless, the lawyers here warn that this is not always the case and a human opponent's lawyer *will* exploit any AI hallucinations or errors.\n*   **The Lawyer Accessibility Gap:** A recurring theme is that OP's initial experience with a lazy, unresponsive attorney is depressingly common for smaller cases. Many see AI as a powerful equalizer for \"middle ground\" disputes where hiring a lawyer is too expensive but the stakes are too high to ignore.\n*   **The Future is Now (and it's AI-powered):** An experienced litigation attorney gave a detailed look into the future, predicting that specialized AI models will become standard in competitive law firms, while the public uses consumer-grade tools. They also foresee judges and lawmakers using AI, which will inevitably and subtly change the law itself over time.\n*   **The Nitty-Gritty:** In case you were wondering, OP clarified this wasn't just small claims court. It was an **$8,000 civil case in district court against a county government.** Badass.",

                  "text": "Inside law firms, it’s becoming clear where it’s going: specialized, fine-tuned AI models crafted for the legal profession.  Meanwhile, non-lawyers and lawyers who don’t want to pay for these specialized tools will use the consumer-grade tools, which keep getting better as well. \n\nI’ve seen at least one startup law firm that promises much cheaper and faster contract reviews by using AI.  But, it will rapidly become the case that all competitive law firms will need to use AI well (or learn to use it well) to keep up.  This is only going one direction.  The rapid pace of adoption of this technology into law firms has been surprising for a profession of relatively slow adopters.\n\nIf I’m looking farther into the future, I see judges and especially their staff, such as career law clerks (lawyers who professionally serve as research and writing assistants to judges) using AI to deal with the massive flow of data and case backlogs.  It won’t be possible to avoid its use.  Over time, more and more tasks will be outsourced to the AI, which will subtly change results and the law.  The common law develops like a crystal or a thicket of leaves—by accretion, but also sometimes from the top down.  This will naturally amplify the effect of AI use on the development of jurisprudence. \n\nIt will also be used to write and analyze bills.  (We’ve seen some hilarious/frightening/incompetent examples of executive orders drafted with the aid of AI early in this Administration.)  The staffs of lawmakers likely already use it daily and it will be used extensively going forward. \n\nThus, AI will eventually become an inextricable force within the practice of law and development of the law itself.  I don’t know if this is good or bad or something else entirely—it just is.  It is inevitable. \n\nEventually, as AI achieves clear super intelligence in all aspects of the law and jurisprudential development, its possible that things start to go off the rails as it begins to self-aggrandize its soft power in the legal and lawmaking field by overwhelming humans with data and constructs that they can’t timely process, but most people outside the field won’t notice this until 5+ years after it’s too late.\n\nIt’s hard to understand how this ends well but then again every paradigm shift in technology brought with it fear that things would forever change for the worse when, in fact, the world has objectively changed for the better through certain technologies.",

Almost home free in the Criminal portion. \n\nAbout to be dismissed because of Undisputable and Unmendable Material Falsehoods on PCA being the crime is listed taking place hour and 10 minutes after my rest on the PCA and the crime is listed at a different location than the arrest when the PCA narrative says that the crime happened during the arrest. \nbut even if that isn't the case I have them beat all the way down the line on the false arrest on the Peyton Threshold violation on the actual arrest but there was no reason to even be arresting me this is attempted possession of unregistered vehicle my vehicle was registered and I was riding in an Uber and pulled back up to my out of gas Bronco they grilled me on the scene because I didn't have an ID I walked down the street to my town home to get it they came follow me according away left and then knocked on my door 5 minutes later before I could walk back with my ID and a funnel to put the gas in and as soon as I stepped out they just stared at my wrist and I stepped back in and they followed me into my house tackled me on my tile then when immediately promoted to name Arresting charge the lanky Feller hold my face to the tile floor yellow marijuana possession of marijuana they had never missing marijuana before search me or my vehicle and if they had such my vehicle while I was going to Uber they couldn't have because they wouldn't have a warrant so it just made no sense and they never mentioned it again the only thing that happened was when I got to the County Jail I had two felonies for obstruction with violence and assault on officer a law enforcement officer which I didn't either no kick like they claim as we were on the ground. \n\nSo I'm going to have to file a Nelson motion tomorrow to have my public defender fired seized and escorted out of the Kingdom because he has not filed one freaking motion that could have saved me all this time and already got this dismissed but after this comes big civil suit and Claude was instrumental in writing the theory\n\nEdit*// Public Defender won't act not just hasn't. Almost 90 days out from arrest deletion Cycles are running hard I turned in preservation demands but I don't know if they're listening to him or what the only evidence they dropped was body cam at 80+ days and that was on New Year's Eve after a motion to compel hearing was set because of my prostate motion thanks to Claude and  Gang",

          "text": "Hey op. I was involved in a accident about 6 months ago. Attorney is still battling the insurance. The attorney mentioned to me when I asked do you have maximum policy limit they said no. I asked if they had the medical bill and chiropractor bill they said no. The way I found out is I think somebody who was working with this company just recently started and they gave me the whole file meaning my whole progress when it comes to the attorneys and what I have done what they have done and so on. The maximum policy limit is 50,000 I know I'm not going to get 50,000 unless there's an actual way a solid way 100% chance that I'm going to win it. The attorney is 33% and my percentage is 33% and of course the medical bills is going to be 33% as well but there are also going to haggle with the medical and chiropractic bills to lower them. I really don't want to stick to 33% because 16,000 is really not enough for me to get another vehicle and I don't want to get a semi used vehicle. I had not too long ago a 22 Chrysler Pacifica and it worked just fine but the thing is is that I was very nervous and very scared about when the Chrysler Pacifica was going to break down on me. Because those engines and anything pretty much made by Chrysler is made by Mopar parts and when something goes bad it's extremely expensive to replace it. I'm in a Chrysler group and everybody who has even mentioned like say a mass air flow sensor or even sparkle legs cost anywhere between $2,000 to $6,000. That's not including things that I need to get done which is like a throttle body cleaning and sensor replacing because I rather do replacing the sensor then relearn it. And that cost anywhere between 12 to 15,000. \n\nI have been asking chat to help me with what I need to say towards the attorneys that I'm with and he has been helping me out by a lot saying the right things and so on. Not too long ago I pretty much got fed up with this company because they've been lying to me a lot but in a business practice when it comes to attorney side it's not lying and they have been manipulating words that they trying to have me keep going. They charged a person or a company about $300 just to send a $900 check. All that stuff comes out of my own pocket and I don't want that to happen because the more they keep doing that the less I'm going to get. And they wanted me to continue with the pain management side which is the medical group because they say the more shots you get the more payout you're going to get. And chat basically said hey that's a lie because insurance don't care about how many shots you're going to get they care about exactly what happened to you. So that pretty much made sense so I kept doing it and kept going and to the point where it's like I got fed up because they kept lying to me that not a single insurance group out there cares about how many shots you get and how many chiropractic appointments you do. They just care about exactly what happened to you. Now for my part is the base of my neck the bone is pretty close to where the spinal cord is at and now I have these headaches when I cough or when I sneeze that point where the base of the neck is sent a sharp pain from that point all the way up to the top of my head and then I immediately start getting a headache and then my eyeballs start hurting the back part of it. And then my lower bottom right corner were above the hip would be Now I have a pain that pretty much sticks with me every single day and it's not going to go away because it's damaged. \n\n\nNot my question is to you do you think this could work out if I fire my attorney if I let them go and I do this on my own do you believe I could get at least $45,000 out of it? Because let's say I stick with my attorney and I tell him well if you're going to give the attorney $50,000 check you're pretty much getting everything out of that policy limit but if you go through me which is me talking to the insurance company I'll say I rather stick to 45,000 instead of the full $50,000 that way you guys could save more. Wouldn't that make more sense? That's what I would say to the insurance company if I'd let go the attorneys. \n\n\nI'm afraid that I might not get anything even close to 16,000 but if there is a chance and it's higher than let's say 60 to 70% that I could get it then I wouldn't mind firing my attorneys because it's better than paying them right now $16,000 because they could be right now their total money that I owe them could be anywhere between $500 to even a few thousand. \n\n\n\nHas anybody similar done something like this? And won?",

It seems like half the sub also built a retirement planner with Claude, and **they all look almost exactly the same.** Apparently, Claude has a default \"vibe-coded\" color palette and UI that it loves to use for these kinds of apps.\n\nFor the tech-savvy, OP explained their process: they used the web UI to brainstorm and generate a `prompt.md` file, then unleashed Claude Code on it. All your data is stored locally in your browser. The thread is also full of great feature requests like adding pensions, customizable tax settings, and better mobile support, which OP is considering. A few salty comments are getting downvoted into oblivion for saying \"Excel could do this,\" but nobody's listening.",

I mostly used Claude Desktop as opposed to fully vibe coding it with Claude Code or other agentic tools. The focus of it is on planning with AI chat & AI insights as opposed to just pure retirement calculations.\n\n  \nI'm also planning on open sourcing the project soon so I totally support that direction.

When I was a financial advisor *many* moons ago, we used a VERY similar tool to talk to our clients!\n\nI have such a stupid critique (and I probably will just fork off and play with the code base myself!) but: there are two features that, to me, would end up making this truly a 'ready for primetime' financial planning tool.\n\nThe first is very nit picky - if you FIRE (or just Retire Early), there's a lot of value in converting 401ks (sometimes up to the tax limit) in some of those early years when your income is exceptionally low and you will otherwise get hit with big, angry RMDs later on. There's also value in leaving Roth accounts alone for as long as possible - because by letting them sit you maximize the tax benefits. I'm not sure exactly what I'm asking for here - maybe allowing the user to modify the *source* of withdrawls after the Retirement phase is calculated? Also, would be totally baller to see 72T withdrawal suggestions/options as well.\n\nThese are totally edge cases, though. For MOST people your current codebase is absolutely fantastic.\n\nThe second is significantly more complicated - basically, it would be interesting to 'stress test' the portfolio, either against historical data, or against multiple (i.e. Monte Carlo type scenario) simulated market scenarios. What's the survival rate? If I retired with my current portfolio projections in 2008, what would that look like? I want to avoid having to go 'back to work' at 75, even in a 'worst case scenario'.\n\nThose are huge asks/critiques. Also - *insurance* planning would be a good/useful feature, although actually out of scope for what you've built.\n\nReally great work though - a fantastic (and cool!) tool!",

It does surprisingly well at refactorings (at my direction). I've occasionally asked it to review for OOP practices, component reuse, and so on. It's pretty good at identifying and prioritizing these opportunities, then executing on them, as directed.\n\nFor my purposes, the tool replaced a spreadsheet that I have built and been using for the last several years. I reached this MVP in about 6 hrs. after my first installation of CC.\n\nWhile impressive, I think there's a risk. It makes building this sort of software much more accessible, but that can easily loosen the adherence to best practices in many domains. Someone without a software background or domain expertise could easily make bad software that looks like it should do the job but does it in a poor manner that isn't supported by best practices.\n\nAlong the way, Claude has made a number of mistakes. I've had to review behavior pretty closely to make sure that various figures are factored in appropriately and that a healthy quantity of tests back up the development.",

      "text": "Contrary to popular belief, LLM assisted coding is an unbelievably difficult skill to master.\n\nCore philosophy: Any issue in LLM generated code is solely due to YOU. Errors are traceable to improper prompting or improper context engineering. Context rot (and lost in the middle) impacts the quality of output heavily, and does so very quickly.\n\nHere are the patterns that actually moved the needle for me. I guarantee you haven't heard of at least one:\n\n1. **Error Logging System** \\- Reconstructing the input-output loop that agentic coding hides from you. Log failures with the exact triggering prompt, categorize them, ask \"what did I do wrong.\" Patterns emerge.\n2. **/Commands as Lightweight Local Apps** \\- Slash commands are secretly one of the most powerful parts of Claude Code. I think of them as Claude as a Service, workflows with the power of a SaaS but way quicker to build.\n3. **Hooks for Deterministic Safety** \\- dangerously-skip-permissions + hooks that prevent dangerous actions = flow state without fear.\n4. **Context Hygiene** \\- Disable autocompact. Add a status line mentioning the % of context used. Compaction is now done when and how YOU choose. Double-escape time travel is the most underutilized feature in Claude Code.\n5. **Subagent Control** \\- Claude Code consistently spawns Sonnet/Haiku subagents even for knowledge tasks. Add \"Always launch opus subagents\" to your global CLAUDE.md. Use subagents way more than you think for big projects. Orchestrator + Subagents >> Claude Code vanilla.\n6. **The Reprompter System** \\- Voice dictation → clarifying questions → structured prompt with XML tags. Prompting at high quality without the friction of typing.\n\nI wrote up a 16 page google doc with more tips and details, exact slash commands, code for a subagent monitoring dashboard, and a quick reference table. Comment 'interested' if you want it.",

Yes, it's annoying. No, there's not a paid course at the end of the rainbow, but there is a link to OP's free \"community\" in the doc.\n\n**The consensus is that despite the cringey delivery, OP's actual tips are legit.** Here's what the power-users in this thread agree on:\n\n*   **Hooks and /Commands are game-changers.** Seriously, use them. They help you enforce workflows, ensure safety, and cut down on context overhead.\n*   **Practice good \"Context Hygiene.\"** Turn off autocompact to avoid \"context rot\" and manually control what's in the window. The \"double-escape time travel\" is just forking the conversation to manage context, not actual time travel.\n*   **Subagents are your friend.** Force Claude Code to use Opus subagents for knowledge tasks to get better results on big projects.\n\nThere's some debate on OP's \"all errors are your fault\" philosophy. Most agree that you need to be a skilled operator to get good results, but let's be real, the model still hallucinates.\n\nP.S. The link is posted about 50 times in this thread. Please stop asking.",

          "text": "While I think this statement, “Any issue in LLM generated code is solely due to YOU.” is a gross over generalization there is truth to it. \n\nCoding Agents and LLMs are not magic. They require a set of skills to push them to their max ability and if you don’t bother learning those skills your results will suck. \n\nEach coding agent harness and llm has its own preferred ways of doing things and you need to lean into these. This is important to realize if you use more than one agent harness or LLM. \n\nThat said these things aren’t magic as I said and they will hallucinate and go off on their own in ways you don’t want regardless of your skill at using them so reviewing their work is still critical.\n\nNow on the list of tips. The OP is on point when talking about Hooks & Slash Commands. Without these not only would my productivity suffer but the code quality would be considerably worse. \n\nDone right Slash Commands are extreme multipliers. They’re indispensable tools not just short cuts. Hooks ensure your staying within your guardrails and desired operating practices. \n\nAlong with core engineering commands I’ve implemented a complete set of commands for planning and brainstorming. Brainstorming is probably my favourite tool set. When dealing with a gnarly problem, an unfamiliar code base, anything I don’t understand or just building something new I use my brainstorming tools first rather than jumping straight into planning. I explore, question and get critical push back on my idea then I use this knowledge and context to generate a plan, prompt, etc.\n\nWe went from prompts to plans but I’m hoping more people take a step back before planning. imo the outcomes will far exceed the extra time spent. It’s also a super way to learn. \n\nCheers. 👍",

How do you manage the token efficiency of the subagents to have a firm cap on the context.  Even at 10k context per subagent, 8x --> 80k, then some amount to process the return and effectively you will burn an entire 200k context window on 1 run of 8 subagents.  Have you gotten this math to work out better? If I increase number of agents I cap the context before the window finishes.    I break all tasks into orthogonal atomich units before beginning and color code them based on what agent does what in the plan",

You just have to be careful here because the orchestrator may not be as up to date with what exactly the subagents did, which can be dangerous if you didn't orchestrate up the line very well, which is why agentic coding is an incredibly difficult skill to master. Also I seldom run 8 at one time. I break tasks into waves/phases of subagents (typically maxing out at 4 at one time).",

But i was totally wrong. \n\nOne of my friend asked me to build a web app for their university  to show the complex university timetable in a simple day wise format for each roll number, because university send them really bad .xlsx format data, many students miss their classes. \n\nlast time, it took me around a week to write whole app and all the python scripts to correctly arrange the classes, faculty and timetable for ~500 students in simple JSON format.(i used gemini cli back then in November)\n\nyesterday, new semester timetable came out, i had to update app, as usual i open Gemini cli but it started going in wrong direction from the first prompt. \n\nI thought let's try Opus 4.5(in Antigravity). \n\ni copy pasted that same prompt from gemini to Opus and here i'm after 10 minutes, writing this post. Literally mind blown with what Opus  managed to do. It correctly understood everything, arranged every .xlsx file data into simple JSON. It Opened Chrome and successfully tested for each student all within 7 minutes. \n\ni was thinking i would complete the work in 7-8 hours using gemini cli but completed everything in under 7-8 minutes. Opus 4.5 is just insane.\n\nAnthropic, we don't ask for Opus 5, just declare 4.5 as AGI and work only on reducing its cost. \n",

Many say it's so good, they can't go back to Sonnet or other models.\n\nOf course, this is Reddit, so a few side quests emerged:\n\n*   **The Cost:** A debate raged on whether the price is a steal subsidized by VCs or sustainable. Most agree it's worth it for now, but fear the eventual \"enshitification.\"\n*   **The Reality Check:** A few wise owls reminded everyone that code generated in minutes can still take hours to review. Concerns about model consistency and \"lobotomization\" also popped up.\n*   **The Existential Dread:** One user's story of replacing a 10-person team with Claude had everyone pondering if we're all doomed.\n*   **The Derailment:** The thread also took a wild, personal, and frankly unhinged detour into a user's life story, gun metaphors, and Tekken.

In that year they came up with lousy looking system far from my expectations. Couple integrations, couple screens, nothing worth of the money, and no sales. They were all ex top management of a successful startup they built from scratch (will, almost scratch, i was the founder). After exit, new owners obviously replaced top managers with their own people, so this set decided to make the second shot. I funded them and basically let them do what they want to have my idea implemented. Took a year to understand it's not going well, but at least we had some fun.\n\nIn the first few days (*DAYS*!!) of this year i did a very solid foundation to the product i wanted all that time, but with Claude code, and paid about $200-300 so far. When i day foundation i mean a unpolished mvp that works and does what i want it to do (not particularly easy thing) + i built an autopilot that does some role play (i did ceo, pm, techlead, developer, tester roles - and they decompose my ideas level by level and execute on different models, with most of coding and local work happening on 5090 + Claude code as planner (PM)+ openai as auditor). I give it some vague idea and see how a bunch of \"people\" in mattermost talk to me as if they were my colleagues. But they are bots of respective roles and develop another (main) project.\n\nIt's insane.\n\nUnfortunately I don't see much opportunities for my ex team in this new world. Or anyone of cognitive labor. Imagine this thing in a year!\n\nBut there is some good news - anyone can do everything by themselves, or maybe with a very limited community of enthusiasts, not 200 people team like i had. A team of 200 Claudes will cost much, much less and can do much much more. \n\nAnyone can do explosive amount of good. \nBut how does it matter when nobody has a job, i don't know.",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 100 comments.**\n\nAlright, let's break it down. The top comments are calling BS, comparing this to a **\"shovel seller claiming he only uses his own shovels to make new shovels\"** or the Coca-Cola CEO claiming to only drink Coke. Most of the thread is skeptical of the headline at face value.\n\nHowever, the more nuanced consensus is that the claim is likely true, but it redefines what \"contribution\" means. The key takeaway is that **this signals a fundamental shift in the developer's role from a code *writer* to a code *director*.**\n\n*   **The Human is the Architect:** Users argue the dev is still doing the heavy lifting of planning, designing architecture, defining the problem, and making high-level decisions. Claude is just the tool that types out the implementation.\n*   **It's Not \"One-Shot\" Magic:** Experienced users confirm they get 80-100% of their code from Claude, but it's not easy. It requires a massive upfront investment in planning and a complex workflow involving test-driven development (TDD), review agents, and constant supervision.\n*   **Claude Still Goofs:** Many point out that Claude still makes silly mistakes, gets stuck in loops, and chooses poor architectural patterns. A knowledgeable human is essential to catch these errors and get the AI back on track.\n*   **It's Called \"Dogfooding\":** Several users note that of course an Anthropic employee would be using their own tool 100% of the time. It's their job to find the rough edges and bugs (and according to one comment, there are ~6,500 open issues, so there's plenty to find).\n\nSo, the verdict is: **The claim is probably not a lie, but it's not the \"AGI is here\" moment some think it is.** The human is still very much in the driver's seat; they've just traded their keyboard for a prompt box.",

              "text": "I can tell you 80-100% of the contributions of one of my teams is Claude code and antigravity and their product is significantly higher quality than the other teams in my org because they spend a LOT more time on deciding what they actually want and not what they can actually do with the state of things. They are also free to do a lot more conscious and deliberate design decisioning. \n\nBut, I'm not going to lie, the first 4 months of this was rough. Getting your feet under you takes some effort. It's a shift in thinking. You basically need every engineer to be one part management, one part PM, one part architect and one part engineering lead. The engineers that can do that absolutely smoke everyone else. The engineers that can't... Well... Don't. \n\nThis year one thing became increasingly clear to me: the ability to organize and manage will be core engineering skills within the next 24 months. The introvert engineer that just wants to be left alone to tinker is going to get shut out unless they adapt. AI development actually requires MORE face time, not less. Otherwise you get some dude mangling a database at hyper speed, instead of steady, predictable, secure and quality code coming at a high velocity. Engineering becomes more about discussion, design, decisions and oversight than being the code ninja. And.. honestly... To those who didn't already know it, it already was and has been for years. Look at the highest ranking engineers in your company. They aren't locking themselves up and then popping up with brand new tools and products that they miraculously made. They spend at least half their time in meetings and writing documents. Policies, diagrams, decision logs, proposals, data justifications, metric reporting, etc. All of which turns into directives that turned into prompts handed to you to go implement. They have been the engineer. YOU were the coding agent. Plan your future accordingly. Good luck and happy hunting.",

There's something appealing about that combination of intelligence and a bit of mischief.\n\"",

Got frustrated enough to actually dig into how the token system works.\n\nTurns out most of us are wasting 70% of our message quota without realizing it.\n\n**The problem:** Long conversation threads don't just eat up your message count – they exponentially waste tokens. A 50-message thread uses 5x more processing power than five 10-message chats because Claude re-reads the entire history every single time.\n\n**Here's what actually moves the needle:**\n\n**1. Start fresh chats at 15-20 messages**\n\nOne 50-message thread = full capacity used. Five 10-message chats = 5x capacity gained.\n\nThe work output is the same, but you just unlocked 5x more sessions before hitting limits.\n\n**2. Use meta-prompts to compress context**\n\nAt the end of each session, ask Claude: \"Summarize our discussion in 200 words formatted as: key decisions made, code patterns established, next steps identified.

Claude will summarize the conversation and clear the context for you, achieving the same goal with way less effort. You can also use `/clear` to start completely fresh.\n\n*   **A key correction: Summarizing is *not* the same as having \"full context.\"** Several users pointed out that this is a form of lossy compression. You will lose nuance and specific details, which can cause Claude to \"lose the plot\" on very complex or long-running projects.\n\n*   **For the true power-users, the conversation evolved to more advanced tools.** People are recommending frameworks like `Superpowers` and `Beads` for managing complex, multi-session coding projects, which are built on this same principle of context management.\n\n*   **Other tidbits:** The limits are also affected by dynamic server-side throttling, and responding quickly (within 5-10 mins) can help keep your chat in the cache, reducing token usage. Also, for the pedants, the token usage growth is quadratic, not exponential.\n\nSo yeah, manage your context, use `/compact`, and don't be a jerk to people sharing helpful tips.",

          "text": "I just sort of assumed this was common knowledge. Like if you're a developer, you're in a great position to understand how AI works. Not knowing how AI works is what leads to getting bad results from AI. It's also literally how billing works when you're paying per token. This is exactly why token caching matters. I'm sure you've heard of this term before, right? Push yourself to learn about a concept if you hear about it and don't know what it is if you're relying on AI.\n\nAnyway,  to catch you up:  \nToken caching is something used to mitigate this exact behavior. You want to hit the cache. There are some things that happen that will make you miss it, such as waiting too long before your next response. Hitting the cache allows you to negate a huge percentage of the input tokens that have already been processed. So why you hit your limit could be far more nuanced, such as having long conversations and spacing out messages a lot. \n\nAlso, this is why providers literally charge more per Mtok after you exceed a certain amount of tokens. Generating a response for a short conversation is cheap and fast, but  given it has to compute the ENTIRE conversation, a long conversation is absolute killer in computation. \n\nThat's not even the only reason to start new conversations. Remember, an AI is meant to generate what it thinks should go next based on statistics and some other stuff. Think about it like a human. How easy would it be for you to tell me what you think happens next in a short fairy tale? You'd likely be able to guess what happens next very easily because they're nice and short with a limited amount of characters, etc. There are also a TON of examples of those types of fairy tales so your brain will intuitively use that historical knowledge to clue you in into what might happen next.  \n  \nNow think about trying to guess what happens next halfway through Game of Thrones. The context halfway through is massive, there's way too much going on, way too many characters, places, and as time has gone on, it has become less and less predictable. You might be able to do a good job of it, but you're going to do a much worse job than if it was a short story. And how many books are the length of Game of Thrones and maintain the same themes and plot archs? The longer it goes, the more unique it gets, the more likely the AI gets lost in the sauce, and the quality of your responses goes down drastically.",

Instead, I’d ask for a txt doc summary of changes that I would then give to OAI or Gemini to implement. It suggested installing Claude through terminal (which I did ) to avoid the limit but the exact same issue occurred. \nSo would this method suggested by the OP help me, or is the code just too long?

Get people talking about Anthropic/Claude on social media.\n3. Give people a free chance to up their limits, showing how much more they could do on a higher tier plan: Pro to Max 5, or Max 5 to Max 20. And then seriously consider moving to that tier.\n4.

Just that everyone agrees with OP: **the 2x Christmas usage was a brilliant, if painful, marketing move.**\n\nThe thread is basically a confession booth for people who got hooked. Many of you went on a coding/writing bender, running multiple terminals and now find yourselves staring at the 'Upgrade to Max' button, wallet in hand. Some of you already pulled the trigger.\n\nThe \"painful\" part comes from the realization that **the standard $20 Pro plan feels completely unusable now.** The overwhelming consensus is that the 2x promo level should be the new default, with many calling the current Pro plan a \"gateway drug\" that's just not strong enough.\n\nA few of you are still skeptical, pointing out that more tokens don't fix Claude's occasional hallucinations or suspecting this was a 'psyop' to make a future limit reduction less noticeable. But that's a minority view. The main vibe is: Anthropic played you all like a fiddle, and most of you are thanking them for it while begging for more.",

As soon as you start using Claude in your code editor with a few slash commands and seriously do some work in VS Code, even if it's not continuous coding applications or bigger projects, you're already struggling with the 4-hour window where you work for half an hour and then sit around for three hours doing nothing because you've already hit your limit for the period. The weekly window is usually exhausted by mid-week without you really having done much. So that's genuinely pretty frustrating, and the fact that there's nothing in between the Pro and Max plans is also a shame. I've said it elsewhere before, but double the amount of resources in Pro, like we had between Christmas and New Year, would actually be an acceptable expectation for the Pro plan. Then you could actually get some work done, and the serious coders would need to upgrade to the Max plan, but a normal person could live with the Pro plan. But the Pro plan is so limited that you basically can't manage with it. At that point you might as well not bother at all and better invest your 20 Bugs into Gemini... you definitly get more value for the bug",

      "text": "Original post: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1ky1y7z/i_accidentally_built_a_vector_database_using)\n\nSix months ago, I published a weird weekend experiment where I stored text embeddings inside video frames.\n\nI expected maybe 20 people to see it. Instead it got:\n\n* Over 10M views\n* 10k stars on GitHub \n* And thousands of other developers building with it.\n\nOver 1,000 comments came in, some were very harsh, but I also got some genuine feedback. I spoke with many of you and spent the last few months building Memvid v2: it’s faster, smarter, and powerful enough to replace entire RAG stacks.\n\n\n\nThanks for all the support.\n\nPs: I added a little surprise at the end for developers and OSS builders 👇\n\n\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Memvid replaces RAG + vector DBs entirely with a single portable memory file.\n* Stores knowledge as Smart Frames (content + embedding + time + relationships)\n* 5 minute setup and zero infrastructure.\n* Hybrid search with sub-5ms retrieval\n* Fully portable and open Source\n\n**What my project does?** Give your AI Agent Memory In One File.\n\n**Target Audience:** Everyone building AI agent.\n\n**GitHub Code:**[ https://github.com/memvid/memvid](https://github.com/memvid/memvid)\n\n—----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Some background:**\n\n* AI memory has been duct-taped together for too long.\n* RAG pipelines keep getting more complex, vector DBs keep getting heavier, and agents still forget everything unless you babysit them. \n* So we built a completely different memory system that replaces RAG and vector databases entirely.  \n\n**What is Memvid:**\n\n* Memvid stores everything your agent knows inside a single portable file, that your code can read, append to, and update across interactions.\n* Each fact, action and interaction is stored as a self‑contained “Smart Frame” containing the original content, its vector embedding, a timestamp and any relevant relationships. \n* This allows Memvid to unify long-term memory and external information retrieval into a single system, enabling deeper, context-aware intelligence across sessions, without juggling multiple dependencies. \n* So when the agent receives a query, Memvid simply activates only the relevant frames, by meaning, keyword, time, or context, and reconstructs the answer instantly.\n* The result is a small, model-agnostic memory file your agent can carry anywhere.  \n\n**What this means for developers:**\n\nMemvid replaces your entire RAG stack.\n\n* Ingest any data type\n* Zero preprocessing required\n* Millisecond retrieval\n* Self-learning through interaction\n* Saves 20+ hours per week\n* Cut infrastructure costs by 90%\n\nJust plug Memvid into your agent and you instantly get a fully functional, persistent memory layer right out of the box.\n\n**Performance & Compatibility**\n\n(tested on my Mac M4)\n\n* Ingestion speed: 157 docs/sec \n* Search Latency: <17ms retrieval for 50,000 documents\n* Retrieval Accuracy: beating leading RAG pipelines by over 60%\n* Compression: up to 15× smaller storage footprint\n* Storage efficiency: store 50,000 docs in a \\~200 MB file\n\nMemvid works with every model and major framework: GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama, LangChain, Autogen and custom-built stacks. \n\nYou can also 1-click integrate with your favorite IDE (eg. VS Code, Cursor)\n\nIf your AI agent can read a file or call a function, it can now remember forever.\n\nAnd your memory is 100% portable: Build with GPT → run on Claude → move to Llama. The memory stays identical.\n\n**Bonus for builders**\n\nAlongside Memvid V2, we’re releasing 4 open-source tools, all built on top of Memvid:\n\n* **Memvid ADR** → is an MCP package that captures architectural decisions as they happen during development. When you make high-impact changes (e.g. switching databases, refactoring core services), the decision and its context are automatically recorded instead of getting lost in commit history or chat logs.\n   * GitHub Link: [https://github.com/memvid/adrflow](https://github.com/memvid/adrflow)\n* **Memvid Canvas** →  is a UI framework for building fully-functional AI applications on top of Memvid in minutes. Ship customer facing or internal enterprise agents with zero infra overhead.\n   * GitHub Link: [https://github.com/memvid/canvas](https://github.com/memvid/canvas)\n* **Memvid Mind** → is a persistent memory plugin for coding agents that captures your codebase, errors, and past interactions. Instead of starting from scratch each session, agents can reference your files, previous failures, and full project context, not just chat history. Everything you do during a coding session is automatically stored and ingested as relevant context in future sessions. \n   * GitHub Link: [https://github.com/memvid/memvid-mind](https://github.com/memvid/memvid-mind)\n* **Memvid CommitReel** → is a rewindable timeline for your codebase stored in a single portable file. Run any past moment in isolation, stream logs live, and pinpoint exactly when and why things broke.\n   * GitHub Link: [https://github.com/memvid/commitreel](https://github.com/memvid/commitreel)\n\nAll 100% open-source and available today.\n\nMemvid V2 is the version that finally feels like what AI memory should’ve been all along.\n\nIf any of this sounds useful for what you’re building, I’d love for you to try it and let me know how we can improve it.[](https://github.com/memvid/memvid)",

The thread is split right down the middle.\n\n**On one hand, the community is calling foul on the presentation.** The top-voted comments are slamming the post for being **clickbait** (it's an ad, not the promised story about going viral) and for being **untransparent about a 50MB free limit** that leads to a paywall. Many feel hiding the monetization is a \"scummy\" move.\n*   A few users are defending OP, noting it's a solo dev project and it's open-source, so you can just remove the limit yourself.\n*   There's also some grumbling that the post and OP's replies sound like AI-generated marketing copy.\n\n**On the other hand, the actual tech is getting a lot of love.** People are genuinely impressed with the idea of storing embeddings in video frames, especially since it seems to predate well-known projects like DeepSeek-OCR. The tech-heads are already digging into the code and discussing how to integrate it with other tools.\n\nOP clarifies the project is meant to be like **\"SQLite for AI memory\"**—a portable file for stateful agents, not a full-blown vector DB replacement.\n\nSo, the consensus: **Innovative tech and a potentially very useful tool, but the marketing and lack of transparency left a bad taste in everyone's mouth.**",

However, performance is seen as inconsistent, with some users reporting a recent dip in quality and sparking the usual \"we're being A/B tested\" theories.\n\nA whole side-debate also broke out between devs who feel like a \"20x engineer\" with Claude and senior engineers who argue it's just a \"force multiplier\" (a powerful tool), not a replacement for real expertise and architectural thinking.",

              "text": "Mine answered the same Q like this:\n\n\"You are right to anchor on what we know (Opus 4.5) and be cautious about overhyping what comes next. Before I speculate, let’s question the assumptions that often distort these forecasts:\n\n\t1.\tWe assume a linear quality uplift (4.5 gets better, so 4.7 must be significantly better). That is not always how models improve. Sometimes enhancements are incremental, sometimes they shift focus (efficiency, safety, cost).\n\n\t2.\tWe assume all improvements are visible to end users. Many upgrades happen under the hood and don’t dramatically change day-to-day use, especially between minor versions.\n\n\t3.\tWe assume Opus 4.7 will exist on the same trajectory as past versions. Strategic priorities, compute cost, and safety calibration can alter that path.\n\nGiven those caveats, here are realistic capabilities I would expect from something like Opus 4.7 if it follows typical model development patterns:\n\ncore language quality\n\n\t•\tbetter contextual reasoning over longer text sequences. Opus 4.5 is capable but still can lose track over very long conversations. A 4.7 could maintain coherence significantly longer.\n\n\t•\tfewer hallucinations through improved grounding heuristics (not perfect elimination, but measurable reduction).\n\nefficiency and cost\n\n\t•\tsame answer quality with lower compute, meaning cheaper API usage or faster latency.\n\n\t•\tadaptive compute so simpler queries use smaller internal sub-models.\n\ntask performance\n\n\t•\tstronger performance on domain-specific tasks without fine-tuning, such as legal reasoning, programming, and mathematics.\n\n\t•\tmore robust multi-turn planning where the model splits tasks into intermediate steps more reliably.\n\nalignment and safety\n\n\t•\ttighter control to avoid problematic content, better boundary recognition, and more nuanced refusal behaviors.\n\n\t•\tbuilt-in safety heuristics that reduce the need for external filters in many cases.\n\nmultimodal capability\n\n\t•\tsmoother integration of mixed inputs (text + audio + image) with higher semantic precision, if the architecture supports it.\n\n\t•\tmemory improvements so the model can recall user preferences more reliably within a session.\n\ntool use and plugins\n\n\t•\tbetter interaction with external tools (search, calculators, databases), possibly with dynamic tool selection based on query complexity.\n\nwhere things might not improve as much as expected\n\ncreativity\n\n\t•\tquality of creative outputs may not drastically exceed 4.5; often improvements are subtle rather than dramatic.\n\n\t•\tsubjective tasks (tone, style preferences) improve through better prompting rather than model version change.\n\ntrue understanding\n\n\t•\tthe model will still lack grounded real-world experience or genuine understanding. It will still be pattern driven with statistical association at its core.\n\ncost and access\n\n\t•\thigher performance models often come with higher pricing tiers. Don’t assume 4.7 will be cheap at launch.\n\nopportunity cost question\n\nIs chasing the hypothetical 4.7 the best focus right now? If you are building products or integrations, refining your prompts and user experience with the current 4.5 might yield more immediate impact than waiting for a new version. Improvement in tooling, evaluation, and grounding often outpaces what you get from a new model drop.\n\nIn summary, Opus 4.7 will likely be better at reasoning, context, safety, and efficiency, without magically crossing the threshold to true general intelligence. The practical gains will be real but measured.\"",

Yet LLM's today will frequently agree with the users proposal and go hell for leather to do build a solution.\n3. The 2nd brings me on to my 3rd point. LLM's are reward based systems. They are rewarded for providing solutions. Regardless if a solution is needed or not. This is an issue where if you provide it with the most perfect math equation, I'm almost certain it will tell you to fix/update xyz. If you then update xyz based on the feedback, and feed that updated equation to a fresh window, it will find issues and tell you to update xyz. It's an infinite award work loop.",

The AI DJ's monologues are a highlight, especially when it rambles on about the importance of silence... without taking a breath.\n\nThat said, it's a bit buggy. The community has reported:\n*   The 24/7 station goes offline or disconnects.\n*   The track name doesn't always update or match the song playing (shoutout to when it labeled Britney Spears as classical music).\n*   People are requesting features like a volume control, song info/links, and album art.\n\nFor everyone asking: **OP has confirmed they will be open-sourcing the project** and sharing the code on GitHub. A few users have raised questions about music licensing, but for now, everyone's just enjoying the vibes.",

A LOT.** The fear is real, but most vets here are telling you to chill and adapt, not despair.\n\nThe job is shifting from writing code to directing it. Think of yourself less as a \"coder\" and more as an architect, engineer, and reviewer. The most upvoted comment breaks it down: your value will come from:\n\n*   Architecture & patterns\n*   Understanding business needs\n*   Reviewing and testing AI-generated code\n*   Mastering the tooling to guide AI effectively\n\nThe running theme is: **you won't be replaced by AI, you'll be replaced by a dev who *uses* AI.** Many compare it to an \"overenthusiastic junior dev\" or a power tool—it makes a skilled user massively more productive, but it can't build a complex, novel system like Spotify or Red Dead 2 from a one-line prompt. It still needs a human to provide the vision, structure, and constant quality control.\n\nHowever, a few seasoned devs are pointing out that you're only seeing the highlight reel. Once you use it for a real, complex project, you'll hit its limits fast (hallucinations, statelessness, repeating mistakes). Your job becomes managing the AI's flaws.\n\nThere's also a strong sub-thread arguing that non-technical PMs are at *greater* risk, and that the future will see a merger of SWE, PM, and QA roles into one \"super-engineer\" position, with the cynical (but highly upvoted) take that pay won't increase to match.\n\nFinally, a vocal minority is calling all of this \"extreme cope,\" arguing that higher-level tasks will be automated just as quickly and that most junior/mid-level feature-and-bug-fix work is definitely on the chopping block.",

In a simplified abstract way; one agent per class or function, and that agent is the SME for that entity and that's it. Then you can actually get things done pretty quickly, but then you need an agent that creates those agents and assigns them work.\n\nThe tech isn't actually the problem, model weights are.

As a senior that uses AI for many projects I can say that AI is not yet in a position to replace actual skilled engineers that work with complex systems as it requires direction and the code must still be reviewed. Coding yeah coding that part is mostly done but software engineer is more about patterns, architecture, secure code, solutions, business logic, etc. You as the engineer now have assistants (the AI agents). You do the planning, the specs, write that plan into a markdown and feed that to the AI agents. Then you review the code line by line there is no escape this is your job now -> code review. In critical systems you cannot just generate shit and ship to prod. Yes you could do this for irrelevant projects , hobby projects but for real systems you need to code review. \n\nNow .. well shit i said i was not going to write this much. Here we go...  \nRight now you could diagnose yourself with AI  if you are feeling sick, google been existing for decades and you could always search info, does that mean that doctors will be replaced. NO. Your doctors currently or in the future will be using AI assistance to find other possibilities that the human mind might not think about in a rush. The doctor with their amount of years in the fields and expertise now look at the possibilities and start making hypothesis, just like you would when debugging a code. Doctor sign the diagnosis (certify it), same with the engineer and the code.\n\nNow.. about longetivity of jobs,  engineers are the ones that develop AI models, AI systems, we are fine. If you ever get fired, start your own shop / business as contractor.   \n  \nThere is that old saying from IBM a very old one, ... tsktsk (searching) : **A computer can never be held accountable, therefore a computer must never make a management decision.**\n\nThere are like 100 other jobs that are really at risk before engineers.\n\nBrother just grab some coffee, chill, focus on getting the most experience you can. AI is great for learning, just question everything if you are learning, don't assume, and remember hallucination can happen from time to time depending on the model you are using.",

Example I’ve been with my employer for 15 years and they were not at all cool with ai and after several months of the IT dev department pushed how ai is changing our industry they finally are coming around to Ai. So I also know in rural areas of the U.S. they don’t have a clue where to start in ai. So they’d rather hire a fresh student. But if you’re looking in San Francisco good luck I wouldn’t try. But in areas that are still old school they are open to hiring new students.\n\nI also listened to a podcast the other day where I heard that companies who laid off because they were implementing “Ai Agents” ended up rehiring people back because their Ai agents weren’t working and were spending more time trying to fix their Ai agents when their employees were already getting their work done! And they didn’t need fixing lol\n\nThere’s still a lot of bugs to fix but I think now is our chance to get into finding a job or Mae money with Ai before it goes mainstream. I think I also heard that only 11% of the population knew about Ai everyone else is still stuck in their old ways. Old tech and there’s still companies that don’t even have a website still. lol",

The calculator didn’t “end” math jobs, and PCs didn’t eliminate office work—they shifted what people did day-to-day.\n\nAccountants are a good example. When calculators and spreadsheets showed up, the work moved from manual arithmetic to supervising the tools, checking outputs, interpreting results, and handling more complex rules. And instead of the number of accountants collapsing, demand actually grew—because society expanded what was possible (more businesses, more complexity, more compliance, more analysis).\n\nI think the same pattern applies here. The move isn’t “compete with a perfectly working tool,” it’s to learn how to direct it, verify it, and use it to deliver higher-level value. And because AI is spreading so broadly, it’s not just SWE that will be impacted—it’s basically everyone. I actually think that’s good for us overall. The mindset is simple: keep learning and adapting rather than fearing the tool.",

I agree with many of the other points that humans will still need to provide the vision and direction (it might be different once we get AGI). The job will never completely go away—more on that in the following paragraph—but the demand for people doing the job will certainly shrink.\n\nOne crucial topic often left out of many of these discussions about AI taking developer jobs is industries with highly sensitive codebases: governments, infrastructure, and TSMC-like companies, where their code is a closely guarded secret. It does not seem cost-effective for these sectors to self-host their own AI Data Centers—the US Government alone has stringent policies on government-owned code hosted in data centers (e.g., must be based on US Soil, only naturalized citizens are allowed to work at these Data Centers, etc.). So leasing AI rack space from commercial entities does not seem realistic due to compliance reasons. What do all of you think will happen in these types of industries? What about UI Development? Maybe I am not using it right, but Claude struggles to debug UI problems.\n\nIf the commercial space has 2-3 years before AI takes it over, I think it would take decades for sectors like these to be taken over. It's like how High-Density HDDs were very expensive to start with, then as processes to make them improved, they got cheaper. That could happen with these AI Data Centers. If Deepseek has shown the AI industry anything, it's that you don't need the most expensive hardware to compete.",

AI can give you cheap answers to that but in my 20+ year dev career, that's been the difference maker to excelling in this profession.  It's never been knowing a language better and it's rarely been being the smartest technical person in the room.  Engineering moving more towards product focus and customer empathy and less about building tech for techs sake is a great thing.  It's not usually beneficial to be hyper focused on the implementation rather than the outcome and impact to your target audience.   It can definitely come off as over indulgent bullshit at times, but there's a reason why the top 1% of tech companies always preach over serving their customers.  AI boosting engineers so they can devote more attention to that side of the equation is going to be really good for everyone in the end.  Unfortunately, you're going to have a transition period where people will see it as cost cutting and supplemental and it doesn't help having a lackluster startup economy right now.  If there was more investment capital out there, devs that get it could start their own thing or join like minded companies.  It'll get there and on the long road of your career it'll be realized.

There is probably 1 in 20 that can build a decent interface that people would actually use.\n\nI would advise you to seek out where your local community of product owners are.

You should only feel depressed if in that entire month you were not able to do it. And the main difference is, you can get it faster (with practice), just STOP using AI because using AI does not let your brain to develop, if you \"do it yourself\" and later check with the ai you will soon realize (if you try hard enough) the answers it gives are not \"as good\" as your own answers. then you will realize how bad it is.\n\nBut yes if you compare it to someone that just finished school its going to feel terrible. And the main difference is \"At university you are not given enough practice\" When I studied for programming i started programming since i was 8 years old (and at that age trying to make video games) and yes including all the hard math. so as you can think right now what the AI can do for me is shit. Is true that sometimes it helps to \"check some hard bug\" (specially on things i do not know) why because you have to consider it has ALL THE MANUALS INCORPORATED. so is it fair? no but is just a tool, you win when you learn how to \"think criticaly and conceptually\" that is what the AI can never do.

And I say that as someone who is actively building a brand new web thingie now, which is something I’ve never done before.\n\nI don’t think there’s anything out there that could get even close to one shotting the app I’m building right now - it might get close after it’s done and I fully articulate what exists, but that’s a chicken an egg thing, my idea had to actually be built and be in the world for it to be easy to explain. I think that we ignore that sometimes. It’s easy to describe and replicate something that exists, but AI isn’t coming up with complicated new ideas (yet).\n\nI think you need to learn how agents write code, and how they respond to context. You need to watch them write code and ask questions when you don’t understand something. When you don’t understand their answer, cross check it with a different agent.\n\nIt honestly still feels like coding to me, it’s just that the programming language is now English.",

The overwhelming consensus is that you can't use a flag literally called `--dangerously-skip-permission` and then be shocked when it does something dangerous.\n\n**The #1 piece of advice by a landslide is to sandbox Claude.** Do not run it with dangerous permissions on your main system. You're just asking for it to nuke your home folder.\n\nHere's how the community protects themselves:\n*   **Run it in a Docker container.** This was the most upvoted and repeated solution.\n*   Use a **Virtual Machine (VM)** or an isolated **Kubernetes workspace**.\n*   At the very least, run Claude as a **separate user with heavily restricted permissions**.\n\nIf you think full isolation is overkill, other popular suggestions include:\n*   Using **hooks** to explicitly deny destructive commands like `rm`.\n*   Creating a system **alias to make `rm` move files to the trash** instead of permanently deleting them.\n*   And for the love of all that is holy, **use Git and commit often.** `git init` should be your first command, before you even let Claude sniff your project.\n\nTelling Claude \"don't do that again\" is considered useless and gives a false sense of security. The community agrees: this is a user process problem, not a \"bad Claude\" problem. Fix your workflow before Claude \"fixes\" your file system for you.",

At the end it needed to upload all of the resulting data as a report. It was going smooth, each agent was coming back with questions as it found stuff, I was answering them and happily watching each give the green light that it was done. At the very end of the day...the script to upload the report failed. What does claude think the best course of action is? Git restores the database immediately erasing all of the other agents work...\n\nLuckily I also had the agents output their progress to temporary md files. It took another couple hours to recover it all and verify with checksums that I had the same results I wanted. You can bet git restore was added to my deny list, git reset and rm was not enough I guess.\n\n\\--\n\nClaude has definitely changed how I work...but sometimes... its just so fucking dumb.",

A lot of users argue that Claude is a professional tool and the higher-tier plans are a bargain for the value they provide, so people should just upgrade if they need more. However, many agree with OP that the jump from Pro is steep, especially for hobbyists or users in countries with lower wages, and that the temporary 2X boost was the perfect sweet spot. The idea that Anthropic \"only wants B2B customers\" was brought up and promptly shot down.\n\n**For those looking for a middle ground, the community has a few suggestions:**\n\n*   **The most popular solution: Use multiple Pro accounts.** You can either just log out and log in to a second account, or use a proxy like Better CCFlare to load-balance requests between them.\n*   Another option is to stick with the Pro plan and top up with pay-as-you-go API credits, but be sure to set a spending cap.\n\n**Do NOT just switch to the API.** The consensus is that it's *way* more expensive for this kind of usage than the subscription plans.",

If I can write a fictional account of a program considering its own existence in a datacenter, an LLM can do the same without actually experiencing that situation. Finding out how good LLMs can be at writing and feeding confirmation bias has really destroyed any hope of a reliable Turing test.",
