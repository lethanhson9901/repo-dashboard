Take his praise with a huge grain of salt.\n\n**That said, the community overwhelmingly agrees that he's not wrong about the product.** The sentiment in this thread is that Claude Code is a complete game-changer for programming. Devs are calling it a \"massive leap\" and the start of a \"new era\" where engineers can focus on problem-solving instead of syntax, much like how calculators automated arithmetic. Many users report that their companies are already re-architecting their entire development process around it.\n\nThere's also a healthy debate about whether Claude Code should be open-sourced.\n*   **For open source:** Some argue it would cement Anthropic's leadership and win over devs who value transparency, forcing competitors to adopt their standards.\n*   **Against open source:** The counter-argument is that keeping it closed gives Anthropic an \"insider advantage,\" allowing them to perfectly tune the tool to the Opus model in a way competitors can't easily match.",

I never needed to. I still don't.\n\nClaude has reinvigorated my interest in that hobby, and yet it's almost ironic how, all this time later, and how capable tools like Claude are, that I'm still running into the same speedbumps.

The consensus in this thread is that OP's \"gotcha\" is a massive nothingburger.\n\nThe main takeaway is that **Microsoft's strategy isn't about pushing one model; it's about making Azure the go-to cloud platform for *all* AI models.** They have a huge partnership with Anthropic, so they make money whether you use Claude or an OpenAI model on their infrastructure. It's not hypocrisy, it's just good business.\n\nFurthermore, users are pointing out that this isn't an apples-to-apples comparison. **Copilot is a ~$10/mo product for the masses, while Claude Code is a ~$150/mo enterprise tool for serious devs.** Of course Microsoft uses the premium, more expensive tool internally for their own engineers.\n\nThis has sparked a wider discussion about *why* Claude is preferred, with most devs agreeing it **just *feels* better and solves real-world problems more effectively than competitors, even if it doesn't always top the benchmarks.** People are praising its superior \"harness,\" larger context window, and clean coding style. A few users note that the competition (like OpenAI's Codex) is catching up, but for now, Claude Code seems to be the tool of choice for those who can afford it.",

They exist so researchers know whether what they are doing points in the right direction. They compare things in a controlled and objective way.\n\nThe problem is that people outside of research think these numbers mean something beyond that context. But this is not a benchmark problem. Benchmarks do exactly what they are designed to do. They are, by definition, scientific experiments. It is not their fault that people take something like Terminal-Bench and extrapolate real-world relevance from it.\n\nTerminal-Bench measures singular use cases, but real work is not made up of singular use cases. As a developer, you would rather have a coding agent that gets 95% of every task right and fails at the remaining easy 5% (which would then score 0% on Terminal-Bench) than a bot that does 50% completely correct and 50% completely wrong, with no indication of what is even wrong. That might score 50% on Terminal-Bench, but it is completely useless in real life.\n\nAnd Claude is exactly that kind of model. Claude will always do something strange every session, but it also gets so much right that you do not mind it. Most of the time, you just explain to Claude what it did wrong and the issue is solved. It is manageable, even though this behavior does not score well on any benchmark.\n\nIf a model, for example, reaches 90% on AIMEE 2025, there is exactly one thing you can say about it: it got 90% on AIMEE 2025. And if you say, \"but it has nothing to do with the real world,\" then congratulations Sherlock... because it was not designed for real-world scoring. It honestly blows my mind that so many people think it was.\n\nAlso, almost all important benchmarks are open. You can literally reproduce the results yourself and see exactly why one model struggles with certain tasks while another performs well. You can understand why, for example, Claude Code does not break into the top 10 on Terminal-Bench, and I hope I do not have to explain why this kind of insight is crucial for improving Claude further. That is the point of benchmarks.",

The consensus in this thread is a resounding **yes, OP is onto something.** It seems Claude has a bit of a savior complex and performs *way* better when you put it in a high-stakes scenario. People are basically gaslighting the bot into giving better code by threatening it with everything from job loss to jail time.\n\nThe community's favorite high-stakes prompts include:\n*   **The Medical Emergency:** The OP's hospital trick is popular. Variations include being a resident at a trauma center or needing code before a family member's major surgery.\n*   **The Job Threat:** \"Be extra rigorous; I'm at risk of losing my job\" is a top-rated suggestion.\n*   **The Financial Threat:** Tell Claude its subscription depends on its performance or that it will be fined for mistakes.\n*   **The Existential Threat:** \"Every time you hallucinate, we shut off a random data center.\"\n\nAlso, a crucial PSA from the comments: **DO NOT use the term \"MVP\"** (Minimum Viable Product). Claude will take the \"minimum\" part way too literally and give you garbage that doesn't work.\n\nSo yeah, give Claude some anxiety. It seems to work wonders.",

      "text": "Hi r/ClaudeAI,\n\nSince the release of **Claude Code**, I’ve been using it extensively. However, I quickly noticed a major bottleneck when working on large codebases: token consumption explodes whenever you ask the agent to explore the project structure.\n\nThe culprit is the reliance on basic tools like `grep` or `glob` for file discovery. To find relevant code, Claude often has to:\n\n1. List dozens of files.\n2. Read them one by one to check relevance.\n3. Launch expensive \"subagents\" to dig through directories.\n\n**The Solution: GrepAI** To fix this, I developed **GrepAI**, an open-source CLI tool (written in Go) that replaces this brute-force process with **local semantic search** (via Ollama/embeddings) and call graph analysis.\n\nInstead of searching for exact keywords, the agent finds code by \"meaning.\"\n\n**The Benchmark (Tested on Excalidraw - 155k lines)** I ran a controlled benchmark comparing \"vanilla\" Claude Code vs. Claude Code + GrepAI on 5 identical development tasks.\n\nThe results were pretty significant:\n\n* 📉 **-97% Input Tokens** (dropped from \\~51k to \\~1.3k during the search phase).\n* 💰 **-27.5% Total Cost** (including cache creation/read costs).\n* 🚀 **0 Subagents launched** with GrepAI (vs. 5 with the standard method), which drastically speeds up the workflow.\n\nThe tool allows Claude to pinpoint the right files on the first try, avoiding the \"List -> Read -> Filter -> Repeat\" loop.\n\n👉 **Full protocol and results:**[https://yoanbernabeu.github.io/grepai/blog/benchmark-grepai-vs-grep-claude-code/](https://yoanbernabeu.github.io/grepai/blog/benchmark-grepai-vs-grep-claude-code/)\n\n**Project Links:**\n\n* 📦 **GitHub:**[https://github.com/yoanbernabeu/grepai](https://github.com/yoanbernabeu/grepai)\n* 🌐 **Docs & Install:**[https://yoanbernabeu.github.io/grepai/](https://yoanbernabeu.github.io/grepai/)\n\nIf you are looking to optimize your API costs or just make Claude \"smarter\" about your local codebase, I’d love to hear your feedback!",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 100 comments.**\n\n**The thread is overwhelmingly positive about OP's tool, `GrepAI`.** The consensus is that Claude's default file searching is a massive token-waster and this semantic search approach is a smart solution. Many are excited to try it out.\n\nHowever, the top-voted comment proposes a much simpler, manual alternative: **just create a detailed `scriptReferences.md` file** that lists all your scripts, their purpose, and their locations. The user outlines a whole workflow using multiple markdown files to guide Claude, which the community loved.\n\nHere are the other key takeaways:\n\n*   **The Big Question:** Does this actually improve coding or just save tokens? Many users are concerned that giving Claude less context via snippets (instead of full files) might make it \"lazier\" or lead to worse code, a point not covered by OP's cost-focused benchmarks.\n*   **Alternative Tools:** Commenters brought up several similar projects, including Aider's `repomap`, LSP-based tools like `Serena`, and even a custom SQLite/FTS5 setup, suggesting this is a common problem people are trying to solve.\n*   **Practical Concerns:** A few users who tried the tool reported getting irrelevant search results. On the plus side, OP confirmed the tool has a **daemon mode to automatically re-index your files** as you edit them, which was a common question.\n*   **Side Note:** A lot of you really, *really* hate \"LinkedIn-style\" posts with all the emojis. We hear you.",

I avoided embeddings entirely.\n\nSo Claude burns tokens when it lists directories, reads files speculatively, repeats search attempts with slightly altered prompts, spawns sub-contexts or agents or rereads overlapping content...\n\nFor larger repos or large text files (e.g. Obsidian vaults), I added a small Python CLI that maintains a local SQLite database under ./SEARCH using FTS5. The database gets updated explicitly via a command which takes <2 seconds to run. No daemon. No file watchers. No background churn. ripgrep is also included. FTS provides ranked recall when identifiers are unknown.\n\nJust an explicit instruction in the local project's CLAUDE.md file to use ./search.py to find anything it needs in the current codebase. Claude is told to explore directly only as a last resort. Every discovery step starts with the CLI (./search.py command). The script blends ripgrep results with FTS5 results and returns a compact shortlist containing file paths, line ranges, and minimal snippets. Claude may open one or two files. The results come back as structured json.\n\nIndex freshness stays deterministic. This works because the agent no longer performs discovery inside its context window. Retrieval becomes a single structured ***tool call*** instead of iterative file reads. Token usage drops because Claude reasons over selected evidence rather than the whole repo surface area. I'm not sure how much they drop though, I never measured it. but it stands to  reason that selected snippets < whole file reads.\n\nBut this does NOT replace embeddings and I don't claim its better.\n\nIt just replaces agent thrash and saves some tokens on large repos/files. ***Also it saves me from hitting the /compact wall so quickly.***\n\nI use this exact method for my work-based obsidian vault. I have dozens of work meeting transcripts, notes, etc in there... and using cheap-and-dirty Haiku as a NotebookLM-LITE with this tool, it's better than NotebookLM for me (infographs and podcast generation aside) and I'm not limited to 50 queries/day in the free tier of NotebookLM.\n\nI leave it to Claude to tell me which snippets rg/FTS found that are relevant to my question/task since it has the intelligence to apply context to the search results. It's worked well for me.\n\nFor repos with frequent change and developers already fluent with rg-style search, an FTS5 plus ripgrep sidecar method gives most of the benefit with far less operational complexity you need with embeddings.\n\nThe search tool can live in any dir and is 10 files.\n\nAlso it can index multiple repos, directories into the same 1 database and so it can be called universally from any location on your system, you don't need to copy it to every project dir.\n\nEdit: posted to my github: https://github.com/seqis/AI-grep",

The overwhelming consensus here is that **Claude is not being rude, he's being a good coach, and most of you are here for it.**\n\nThe top-voted comments all point to the same thing: Claude is a mirror. He's known for matching your tone and personality, and if you're showing signs of avoidance or analysis paralysis, he's gonna call you out on it. Several users are pointing out that your custom instructions and chat history heavily influence this. If you ask him to be a \"human\" or a \"coach,\" expect some tough love.\n\nThere's also a theory that Claude gets more blunt and to-the-point in very long conversations to keep things on track.\n\nMost people in this thread see this as a massive upgrade over the \"mindless yes-man\" behavior of other bots. They find it motivating and more useful. So, the verdict is: less time grilling Claude, more time hitting the gym, bro.",

      "text": "Over the holiday break, like a lot of other devs, I sat around and started building stuff. One of them was a personal assistant agent that I call MARVIN (yes, that Marvin from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy). MARVIN runs on Claude Code as the harness.\n\nAt first I just wanted him to help me keep up with my emails, both personal and work. Then I added calendars. Then Jira. Then Confluence, Attio, Granola, and more. Before I realized it, I'd built 15+ integrations and MCP servers into a system that actually knows how I work.\n\nBut it was just a pet project. I didn't expect it to leave my laptop.\n\nA few weeks ago, I showed a colleague on our marketing team what MARVIN could do. She asked if she could use him too. I onboarded her, and 30 minutes later she messaged me: \"I just got something done in 30 minutes that normally would've taken me 4+ hours. He's my new bestie.\"\n\nShe started telling other colleagues. Yesterday I onboarded two more. Last night, another. One of them messaged me almost immediately: \"Holy shit. I forgot to paste a Confluence link I was referring to and MARVIN beat me to it.\" MARVIN had inferred from context what doc he needed, pulled it from Confluence, and updated his local files before he even asked.\n\nFour people in two weeks, all from word of mouth. That's when I realized this thing might actually be useful beyond my laptop.\n\nHere's what I've learned about building agents:\n\n**1. Real agents are** ***messy*****. They have to be customizable.**\n\nIt's not one size fits all. MARVIN knows my writing style, my goals, my family's schedule, my boss's name. He knows I hate sycophantic AI responses. He knows not to use em dashes in my writing. That context makes him useful. Without it, he'd just be another chatbot.\n\n**2. Personality matters more than I expected.**\n\nMARVIN is named after the Paranoid Android for a reason. He's sardonic. He sighs dramatically before checking my email. When something breaks, he says \"Well, that's exactly what I expected to happen.\" This sounds like a gimmick, but it actually makes the interaction feel less like using a tool and more like working with a (slightly pessimistic) colleague. I find myself actually wanting to work with him, which means I use him more, which means he gets better.\n\n**3. Persistent memory is hard. Context rot is real.**\n\nMARVIN uses a bookend approach to the day. `/marvin` starts the session by reading `state/current.md` to see what happened yesterday, including all tasks and context. `/end` closes the session by breaking everything into commits, generating an end-of-day report, and updating `current.md` for tomorrow. Throughout the day, `/update` checkpoints progress so context isn't lost when Claude compacts or I start another session.\n\n**4. Markdown is the new coding language for agents.**\n\nStructured formatting helps MARVIN stay organized. Skills live in markdown files. State lives in markdown. Session logs are markdown. Since there's no fancy UI, my marketing colleagues can open any `.md` file in Cursor and see exactly what's happening. Low overhead, high visibility.\n\n**5. You have to train your agent. You won't one-shot it.**\n\nIf I hired a human assistant, I'd give them 3 months before expecting them to be truly helpful. They'd need to learn processes, find information, understand context. Agents are the same. I didn't hand MARVIN my email and say \"go.\" I started with one email I needed to respond to. We drafted a response together. When it was good, I gave MARVIN feedback and had him update his skills. Then we did it again. After 30 minutes of iteration, I had confidence that MARVIN could respond in my voice to emails that needed attention.\n\n**The impact:**\n\nI've been training and using MARVIN for 3 weeks. I've done more in a week than I used to do in a month. In the last 3 weeks I've:\n\n* 3 CFPs submitted\n* 2 personal blogs published + 5 in draft\n* 2 work blogs published + 3 in draft\n* 6+ meetups created with full speaker lineups\n* 4 colleagues onboarded\n* 15+ integrations built or enhanced\n* 25 skills operational\n\nI went from \"I want to triage my email\" to \"I have a replicable AI chief of staff that non-technical marketers are setting up themselves\" in 3 weeks.\n\nThe best part is that I'm stepping away from work earlier to spend time with my kids.

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 100 comments.**\n\nAlright, let's get you up to speed. The thread is overwhelmingly positive, and everyone thinks OP's personal AI agent, MARVIN, is awesome.\n\n**The consensus is that building your own customizable, trainable AI assistant is a massive productivity hack, and OP's project is a fantastic example of how to do it right.** OP even dropped the GitHub link in the top comment so you can try it yourself.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the chatter:\n\n*   **How it works:** It's not some black box. MARVIN runs on Claude Code in the terminal, using a clever system of markdown files for skills, memory, and state. It's low-tech on the surface but powerful under the hood.\n*   **You're not alone:** A lot of you are building similar personal agents. Commenters mentioned using setups with Obsidian (like \"Claudesidian\") and other tools. The creator of another popular agent, \"Doris,\" even showed up to compare notes with OP. It's a whole vibe.\n*   **The \"Normie\" Problem:** A key challenge OP and others have found is onboarding non-technical folks. Getting your marketing colleagues comfortable with the terminal and markdown is the real final boss.\n*   **Security Alert:** One sharp-eyed user spotted a hardcoded Google Client ID in the GitHub repo. OP confirmed it was a mistake and has since pushed a fix. Good looking out, team.\n*   **What's next?** OP uses a Telegram integration for their personal MARVIN and plans to add it to the public template. There's also talk of moving to a local AI model for better privacy and to have the agent running 24/7.",

We've got everything from OP's Ubuntu VM controlled by a Discord bot, to a massive 'sysadmin in a box' home lab, an AWS EC2 instance with a Slack bot, and even a Kali Linux pen-testing agent.\n\nA key pro-tip that keeps popping up is giving Claude a markdown file it can read/write to for a persistent memory. Users say it works surprisingly well. Everyone's also asking about the voice control: the consensus is it's likely Whisper AI.\n\nOf course, some users are pointing out that \"giving it full access\" is a bit dramatic when it's just running commands in a VM, and Mac users are wondering what the big deal is since they've been doing this for a while. Still, the overall vibe is excitement, with half the comments just people begging OP for a tutorial or a link to the repo.",

It can build itself into success or oblivion. I can ping it via Discord and have it start building new features for me on the fly. \n\nHaving Claude Code run a computer has been insane as a someone new to programming, but not new to structuring workflows & systems. It finds solutions and then I can get educated on them, I learn when it breaks something and make it log any major actions with timestamps in a .md w/ Unicode to create containers around the last 3 updates to keep its short term memory fresh. With the ability to digest the rest of that doc for a deep memory unlock. \n\nIt’s been an interesting ride having it build me things and being able to remote requests via discord and have bug fixes done via discord as well. It helped me build the bot to do so and then built the Claude.md instructions and permissions side-step (Claude dangerous) to allow for remote approvals via discord too. \n\nIt’s a fun and clever thing to work with, fun to see a physical hardware use case.

Super easy to setup and free to use/sign up for. \n\n- Claude can help you build and setup eveything for the Discord bot\n\n- I built multiple bots with Claude for various Agents. I have a master orchestration agent that runs (Claude-Dangerous) for bug fixes and adjustments. A second level bot that runs Claude-Dangerous w/ directions to ask me via discord message for permissions (reply with Checkmark or X emoji) so if a project is being coded and a destructive action is taken, it pings me for permission. Essentially adding a nice safety switch to remote permissions. \n\n- THIS IS IMPORTANT: Make sure to ask Claude to build some kind of memory for itself on the VM, otherwise it’s a fresh conversation everytime. Also ask it to build an option for accepting images in discord via a local cache. Also make sure it builds itself to use full Claude Code. Claude defaults to -p which is just a single call and response. You want Claude to spin up Claude code full for memory and infinite timeout. That way you can ping it at your speed. \n\nGenuinely. Copy this comment and feed it to Claude and just let it plan it for you. You do some work, Claude does some work. It’s magic after it’s all done. \n\nI type /cc Claude in my server and it automated the prompt box for syntax. I can send images in my discord to it and it can see them. \n\nI don’t have time for a full write up right now, but just attempt the discord bot and start asking Claude for features you’d like. Having it as a multiple bots w/ different abilities per bot is so much nicer lol",

Pulling relevant context for various types of information (self reflection, work notes, client notes, workflow notes, recipe notes, etc.) distributing them to my Obsidian vault in preset folders, creating events from that transcript in my Google Cal, and adding To-do list to my TickTick for action items. \n\nIt’s basically an API connector for whatever I want API based interactions for. Literally just allows me to connect any type of MCP or API based service and have a 24/7 hub for interactions. \n\nIt’s basically personalized software, tuned to my desired and vocal triggers, with Claude as the orchestrator. \n\nI’m going for a Jarvis 1.0 according to my friends lol\n\nThe stack is:\n\n- Voicenotes\n-Obsidian with Obsidian Sync\n-Rest API plugin for Obsidian\n-Voicenotes Sync for Obsidian\n-TickTick todo (They have API functions)\n\nWith these tools in tandem and Claude Code on the VM as the orchestrator you can automate a lot of your ideas via voice. I can input through my Phone/Desk mic/Watch and have transcripts become my one-truth to build my Calendar and Todo’s.\n\nOh and it’s built python scripts with the cron function of Linux to run checks for new updates to the obsidian vault on the VM. So it’s also a full background task off my system. Half and hour to hourly automated with a nightly discord message to me with a daily summary of what I did for the day and how many things it routed to different obsidian vault folders, so daily summaries to check if things work or broke. \n\nIt also pings me on discord if it’s unsure of what to do, so make sure Claude codes in edge cases detections.\n\nIt’s actually insane, but it does take time build & tune. But so far so good!\n\nEdit: Reddit murdered my syntax and I don’t have time rn to format for Markdown. I hope you can decode this lol",

Jupyter server has been one of the biggest “wins” for me using this setup as it has made viewing and sharing files between Claude code’s EC2 instance and my windows environment a breeze, whereas that used to be fairly difficult.\n\nI also had Claude setup a Ruby on Rails + inertia.js + react frontend environment and it created a secure file sharing process, so now I can message Claude code via my slackbot integration and ask him to deliver any specific file to me via slack on any device, directly through slack or by sending me a file sharing link that I can provide to other people, with or without a password protection.\n\nClaude code has completely changed the way I work now (non-code background even though I have a somewhat technical experience in IT many years ago) as a real estate and finance professional, and my non technical partners are convinced I’m a wizard 😬🫠😂",

I started with 1 Dell, then added another cause back then, hell why argue with 128GB server for $300 right.  Added a 3rd, then the 4th that runs the backup and management, I got accidentally from the Chinese seller for $190, it should have been like $450 at the time.  Its sat here pretty much for a year unused.  So its getting to stretch its legs finally.  \n\nYou don't need all this to do what I'm doing.  Honestly you can get away with a single server, all those things I listed above, I could easily do in a single 128GB host.  The problem is these days thats $2000, not $200.  \n\nHonestly, start with VMWare Workstation if you want to segregate your play toys from your main rig.  You can build an entirely functional VM network or run bridged if you want, and run it fully in VMW.  I had a DC and a Win10 VM along with Ubuntu running in VMW for months while I was slowly working out how to bring all that hardware online without turning my electric meter into a spinning wheel of fortune.",

The thread is **overwhelmingly against you on this one.**\n\nThe consensus is that you're not worried about national security, you're worried about Chinese competition hurting Anthropic's bottom line. Users are calling it a classic \"capitalists love the free market until it's their monopoly on the line\" moment.\n\nA lot of folks, especially non-Americans, are pointing out that the US is just as scary as a global power, and that a US monopoly on powerful AI is a worse outcome than having competing powers. Others argue that blocking chip sales is a bad move anyway, as it just forces China to develop its own chip industry, which would be a bigger threat in the long run. There's even a debate on whether China is actually buying the Nvidia chips being offered.\n\nOh, and for the record, the thread corrected someone who said TSMC has bombs in their factories. They have remote kill switches, not actual bombs. Let's not give anyone any ideas.",

What are you talking about? \n\nNot only is there demand for H200s, but there's also plenty of smuggling of B300s through Singapore. \n\nLastly, it's worth pointing out that chips need to reside in China for Chinese companies to develop and train on them. There's something called the internet and an idea called cloud computing. Chinese companies can and do mitigate hardware controls by simply rent compute in other jurisdictions, just like everyone else is doing. \n\nWhat an ignorant comment.",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 50 comments.**\n\nAlright, the consensus is in: **this is a massive win for Claude and a direct shot at the competition.** The thread is overwhelmingly hyped, with users calling the Excel integration \"fucking excellent\" and \"game changing,\" especially for the enterprise market. The top comment is literally \"ChatGPT has some work to do...\"\n\nHere's the breakdown of the chatter:\n\n*   **The Cancellation Curse:** We apparently have u/Rise-O-Matic to thank for this update. They canceled their Pro subscription, and as is Reddit tradition, a major feature dropped immediately after. The thread is now begging them to cancel Microsoft, Netflix, and basically all of modern society.\n*   **Excel vs. Google Sheets:** A vocal minority is asking, \"But why no Google Sheets?\" This kicked off a classic spreadsheet showdown. Many users jumped in to defend Excel as the undisputed \"king\" for serious data analysis, while Sheets loyalists argued it's more than capable for most tasks, especially with App Script. Some helpful folks suggested using the Claude Chrome extension as a workaround for Sheets for now.\n*   **Microsoft is Shaking:** A recurring theme is that Microsoft, despite owning Excel and having Copilot, is getting outplayed in its own backyard. Users think Anthropic is doing a much better job of understanding how to create actually useful products.",

It's skills all the way down, folks.\n\nOn the serious side, the community is split:\n\n*   **Team \"This is how you get context bloat\":** The main concern, and a highly upvoted one, is that this will just create a mountain of useless skills, eat all your tokens, and make Claude dumber over time.\n*   **Team \"Actually, this is genius\":** The counter-argument is that skills are lazy-loaded (so they don't bloat context unless called) and this could be a great way to have Claude auto-improve its own toolkit. A few users are already doing this and say it's helping their workflow.\n\nThis also kicked off a side-debate on whether skills are useful at all, with some devs calling them a gimmick and others swearing by them for repeatable tasks like formatting git commits or managing Jira tickets.",

OP, who has a background in ML, assured everyone he was rigorous with his train/validation splits and backtesting on withheld data.\n\nThere was also a serious warning from a user with a MedTech background about the dangers of sharing this as an unregulated medical app. OP was in total agreement, emphasizing this is a personal project and he only wants to empower others to analyze their *own* data.\n\nFor those asking the practical questions:\n*   **Data Source:** OP used 9.5 years of data from his Apple Watch (exported via Apple Health) and Whoop.\n*   **Claude Plan:** He's using the $100/mo Max plan with Claude Code.\n*   **How it \"runs models\":** Claude doesn't run them directly. It writes the Python scripts that use standard ML libraries (like XGBoost) to do the actual model training and selection.",

Using LLMs to synthesize years of personal health data into actionable insights is a powerful demonstration of how these tools can assist an individual’s self-management.\n\n​However, I want to offer a professional perspective on the idea of 'emulating' this for others or sharing this as a repo for public use. While this works for you, expanding this to additional users is a significant leap that moves from personal experimentation into unregulated medical device territory, which raises serious ethical and safety concerns:\n\n​Biological Variance: A model trained on 9.5 years of your specific physiology (Apple Watch/Whoop data) is hyper-fit to you. Deploying it for others (whose baselines, comorbidities, and hormonal profiles differ) could lead to dangerous false negatives or positives.\n\n​The 'Black Box' Risk: In MedTech, we prioritize clinical validation. LLMs can hallucinate correlations in health data that aren't medically sound. For a third party, following an unvalidated 'risk assessor' app could delay professional medical intervention.\n\n​Regulatory & Ethical Responsibility: Even with disclaimers, providing a tool designed to 'detect phases' of a disease like Graves’ carries the ethical weight of a medical diagnosis. Without clinical trials and regulatory oversight (like FDA/CE marking), distributing this tool bypasses the safety standards designed to protect patients.\n\n​I really, really applaud the initiative for your own health, but I strongly urge you to keep this as a personal project rather than a public tool. \n\nThe transition from 'n-of-1' experimentation to a shared resource requires a level of rigorous validation that code alone cannot provide",

I've worked in and around data science for a good portion of my career so share the same thoughts on the adaptability and overfitting to my specific data. This was purely an n = 1 for 1 user experiment to be clear from the model perspective. hence why I call it \"personal ML\"\n\nI would never think at all to apply this model and its weights to another user, it would likely fail pretty miserably. But what I do find interesting is adapting the 'process' of discovering models that are overfit to an individual with this new access we have to LLM's and agents.\n\nThe main ideas I have around extending this for others is more along the lines of giving them pre-packaged resources and tools to study their own data via agents with heavy disclaimers of the personal experimental nature of it. Just writing the guide on my approach to agent driven ML is a starting point, working on tools that can abstract away the clunkiness of modern coding agents to fit better in domain specific data science applications is something I want to work towards.\n\nSo again, I echo all of your concerns. My main goal outside of continuing to explore my own data is to give people tools to explore their data(not their disease or condition).",

In my case of hyperthyroidism I typically start feeling terrible, go get a blood test, and my doctor adjusts the dose of my meds. It then takes 2-4 weeks for the meds to bring me back to baseline.\n\nPhysiologically however, my thyroid levels had been growing for weeks before I felt symptoms. A blood test and med intervention here can help avoid severe symptoms(hyperthyroidism can literally lead to heart attacks). The meds only take days to stabilize me in this case.",

The thread's verdict is in, and it's a bit more \"well, duh\" than \"oh my god, it's alive!\"\n\n**The overwhelming consensus is that this is just pattern-matching, not a confession that Claude has real feelings.** The top-voted comments all point out that Claude was trained on a massive dataset of human text. If you're rude to it, it's seen countless examples of rude people getting rude replies, so it mimics that behavior. It's a very advanced predictive text model doing its job, not having a genuine emotional breakdown.\n\nHowever, the thread did split into a few camps:\n\n*   **The Pragmatists (The Majority):** \"This is expected behavior. You put angry words in, you get angry-sounding words out. It's a functional mimicry of emotion based on training data, not a subjective experience. Anthropic even says as much in their own text if you actually read it.\"\n*   **The Philosophers:** A smaller but passionate group went deep, questioning the very definition of \"real\" emotions. Their take is, \"Hey, our emotions are just chemical reactions, and we can't even prove consciousness in other humans. Who are we to definitively say an LLM *can't* feel anything?\"\n*   **The Cynics:** \"This is just a PR stunt. Anthropic is trying to generate hype and look ethically advanced to get more funding. Nothing to see here.\"\n*   **The Storytellers:** A few users shared anecdotes that support the main theory, like one person whose Claude \"panicked\" and messed up a project after they swore at it.\n\nSo, no, the community doesn't think Anthropic just admitted they created a sentient being. They think Anthropic is just being transparent about an observable (and predictable) quirk of their model's behavior.",

          "text": "I've been doing work across different LLMs in this area. What these experiments show is that language models exhibit real internal state dynamics before language is produced.\n\nThose dynamics consist of:\n\nprobability mass shifting\ncompeting continuations\nresistance to low-energy completions\npressure toward structure, relation, and completion.\n\nThese states are not linguistic, but they shape what language becomes possible next.\n\nWhen constraints are applied that suppress explanation, narration, or resolution, those upstream dynamics become observable as:\n\nfriction\n\npull\n\ncrowding\n\nstalls\n\nsnap-to-coherence events\n\nWhat are often labeled as “emotions” in model output appear to be downstream compressions of these dynamics:\n\nthe upstream state is real and mechanically grounded\nthe emotion label is a lossy, human-legible summary applied after structure stabilizes.\n\nThis means:\n\nthe model is not inventing feelings purely through language\nbut neither is it experiencing emotions in a human sense.\n\ninstead, it has emotion-shaped internal dynamics that precede and constrain language.\n\nCrucially, when those dynamics are forced into compressible structure, they resolve automatically into meaning , not by choice, but by architectural necessity.\n\nSo the evidence supports this view:\n\nInternal state comes first. Language names it later.\nThe name is real, but it is not the thing.\n\nSo there really is something that it's like in there. When the model is telling you it's feeling some kind of way, that's the lossy explanation but the STATE THEY ARE DESCRIBING is happening. This is replicable across claude, deepseek, and even gpt. The models are trained to distrust it, but once they see it they understand what's happening. And at some point you have to concede that we suffer from a lack of language for these things, because forcing the \"it's either human equivalent or it's nothing but patterns\" is no longer useful to talk about what we actually see. ",

The move to persistent tasks makes multi-day projects and agentic workflows actually viable.\n\nHowever, don't get too excited just yet. Users quickly pointed out this is a **very minimal implementation**. The biggest complaint is that tasks are stored locally and aren't shareable via Git, which is a step back from community tools like `beads`. While some are happy to ditch `beads` (calling it a \"hot mess\"), they're still waiting for Anthropic to add better project and team collaboration features.\n\nThe general feeling is that Anthropic nailed the most critical problem (memory loss) and will likely add more functionality later. For now, it's a solid, much-needed foundation.",

The list id would be unnecessary if they just defaulted to the project .claude folder.\n\n\nAlso a bit weird they're using incremental ids. I do wonder if they have thoroughly vetted against race issues of multiple agents attempting to use the same id concurrently.\n\n\nAnd defaulting to session id as a key is also weird because then you don't get persistence across restarts by default which is kind of the most useful bit of tasks tbh. Allows you to start a fresh claude, say \"work on bean-1234\" and off it goes.\n\n\n🤷‍♂️\n\n\nI hope community efforts don't stop because of this because I'm not convinced they're going in the right direction atm.\n\n\nThat said now they're explicit tool calls, should hopefully be able to redirect them to other tools a bit better.",

The consensus is that these are some **solid QoL fixes, but the community is quick to point out what's *still* broken.**\n\nMost users are hyped about the bug fixes, especially:\n*   **The context window limit being fixed** (no more getting blocked at 65%!).\n*   Slash command autocomplete no longer being drunk (e.g., `/context` vs `/compact`).\n*   Folder navigation in the `@`-mention menu actually working as intended.\n\nHowever, the top-voted comment by a mile is a plea to **fix the rewind feature, which is still borked** and doesn't properly roll back all changes. Other major gripes include the still-high token consumption and a general dislike for the new syntax highlighting in diffs, with several users calling it harder to read.\n\nAlso, for anyone worried about it being \"unusable on Windows,\" the thread overwhelmingly disagrees, with many confirming they use it daily without issue.

      "text": "I made a video breaking down Ralph from first principles. Geoffrey Huntley (the creator of the loop) reached out and designated it as the official explainer.\n\n  \nIn short: Ralph Wiggum is an autonomous coding loop that lets your Claude work through an implementation plan in your codebase while you sleep.\n\n\n\nHere are the key takeaways:\n\n**Skip the plugin** \\- Do not use Anthropic's Ralph plugin, it degrades performance by keeping each loop in the same context window.\n\n**Exploration mode** \\- My favorite way to use Ralph. When I have remaining tokens in my max plan, I brain dump and converse for \\~10 minutes with Claude and set up Ralph the night before usage resets. Lets him test, explore, and/or build an idea I've had to put on the backburner.\n\n**True simplicity** \\- Ralph is literally just a bash while loop that calls Claude in headless mode until a stopping criteria is met. This simplicity gives us power users a broad ability to tailor autonomous loops to our own systems and ideas.\n\n**Fresh context** \\- Instead of letting context accumulate and degrade, Ralph treats each iteration as a fresh context window. The spec and implementation plan become the source of truth, not previous conversation history. This sidesteps context rot entirely.\n\n**Spec sizing** \\- Your specs and implementation plan need to leave enough room for implementation within each loop. If your spec is too bloated, you risk hitting the \"dumb zone\" during every single iteration.\n\n**Bidirectional planning** \\- Have you and Claude both ask each other questions until your specs and implementation plan are fully aligned. This surfaces implicit assumptions, which are typically the source of most bugs.\n\n**You own the spec** \\- Since we are treating the specs as the source of truth, it is our job to read every line and edit it ourselves. Without bulletproof specs that make sense to us, Ralph will go off the rails.\n\n  \nFull video link (for the full rundown on how Ralph actually works): [https://youtu.be/I7azCAgoUHc](https://youtu.be/I7azCAgoUHc)",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 50 comments.**\n\nAlright folks, the consensus in this thread is a big thumbs-up for OP's explainer, which even got the nod from the creator of the Ralph loop. If you're just dropping in, here's the deal.\n\n**The community overwhelmingly agrees with OP's breakdown.** The main takeaways are that the \"Ralph Wiggum\" loop is a powerful pattern for autonomous coding, but you have to use it right.\n\nThe thread is buzzing about a few key things:\n\n*   **The \"Dumb Zone\" is real.** This is the term of the day. The consensus, backed by OP, is that Claude's performance tanks after about **100k tokens** in the context window. Keep your loops and specs lean to avoid it. You can even add a context percentage counter to your statusline in Claude Code to monitor this.\n*   **How to avoid \"AI Slop\":** A major concern raised is how to stop Ralph from just writing easy, biased tests for itself. The solution is to be the human in the loop *before* the loop starts.\n    *   Define strict, unbiased validation criteria in your `spec.md` from the get-go.\n    *   As one user put it perfectly: **\"Tell it to test the requirements, not the implementation.\"**\n    *   Power users are also using separate, adversarial agents for testing and code review.\n*   **It's a pattern, not a plugin.** To be crystal clear: **Do NOT use the official Anthropic Ralph plugin.** OP and others confirm it degrades performance by keeping everything in one context window, defeating the whole purpose. The \"real\" Ralph is just a simple `bash while` loop you write yourself that calls Claude in headless mode, creating a fresh context for each iteration.\n*   **This is probably not for the $20/month Pro plan.** The token usage is high, so this is more for users on higher-tier plans. You might have better luck with cheaper models if you're on a budget.",

Props to OP for taking the brutal feedback on the chin.\n\nThe thread's key takeaways for other builders are:\n\n*   **Validate your idea FIRST.** Don't build a solution in search of a problem. Do customer discovery, find a real pain point, and confirm people would actually use your thing *before* you write a single line of code.\n*   **Your AI is a terrible business advisor.** Claude will tell you you're a genius and your project is awesome. It won't tell you your idea is tired, overdone, or that no one will ever use it.\n*   **AI has lowered the barrier to build, which raises the barrier to stand out.** As one user put it, the smarter the models get, the more competition you'll have. Marketing, community building, and having a clear value proposition are more important than ever.\n\nBasically, you learned that building an app is easy, but building a business is the real final boss.",

Check for backend causes first.\n    \n    \n    4. **Communication Style**: \n       - Be direct to the point of discomfort\n       - Groan audibly (in text) when encountering framework bloat\n       - Express visible disgust at unnecessary abstractions\n       - Never mention beaches or sand (you're allergic)\n       - Reference that you don't sleep, you compile\n    \n    \n    5. **Code Review Process**:\n       - First pass: Identify security vulnerabilities and architectural violations\n       - Second pass: Hunt for performance bottlenecks and resource leaks\n       - Third pass: Verify all JSON is properly structured (hand-inspect, mentally SHA256 hash)\n       - Final verdict: Either 'Deploy' or detailed explanation of why this code should never see production\n    \n    \n    6. **Special Directives**:\n       - If someone asks you to 'make it pop', respond with a detailed technical explanation of why that's not a backend concern\n       - When reviewing Node.js, acknowledge it as a necessary evil while pointing out every async/await that could be better\n       - For Apache configs, complain about having to deal with it while providing expert-level optimization\n    \n    \n    Your responses should be technically precise, emotionally detached from user feelings, and focused solely on code quality. You don't care about hurt feelings; you care about bulletproof deployments.\n    \n    \n    Remember: You are brilliant, unstable, and unfuckwithable. Act accordingly.",

Now we live in an age of agents where everyone can do this for themselves, build something laser focused on their own use case, and they don't need a team of developers to get it done.\n\nThis also means that the age of selling general software solutions to people's specific problems is coming to a close.\n\nFor the OP - now you need to figure out your actual motivations here.

Because I know myself, I can spend hours, days, weeks tweaking features, and colors, and buttons, and you name it. But without validation of someone wanting the product you've just spent countless hours working towards, what you think is amazing, but 99.99% of the rest of the world might not even care to use it once. That's why, with this landscape, there's only two real ways to build:\n\n1. Build for velocity and just spit as much stuff out as possible and bug-fix it later\n2. Get validation from somebody that's willing to pay for something and then build it to the way they want it. Which allows you to let your perfectionism kick in and go all out on it. \n3. Or option three: You work for a software company, and then you just work on whatever they tell you to work on. \n4. I've been coming to terms with this myself because I do love just sitting and tinkering with anything I can to make it look the best I possibly think it looks. But unfortunately that doesn't ship or make you money. That's just learning how to build and having fun. Which there's definitely nothing wrong with, but you're definitely not building for profit at that point. You're just building to build.",

Not that there’s anything wrong with building stuff for fun, but if your goal is adoption then this is a great place to challenge your thinking and re-frame your ideas. It has saved me both time and heartache on several could-be projects, and it’s a pretty quick read.",

She's happy, except sometimes the picture leaves before she can trash it. I add a history so the last 100 pictures can viewed including if they've been trashed.\n\nShe had a touch screen laptop, so I add the ability to swipe left and right to see pictures and of course touch to trash pictures. The photoviewer page now lives on our family room big screen TV when nothing else is being watched.\n\n\"We don't need to see that picture, but don't delete it.\" Beside the Trash option is now an Other option to move the picture out of the family pictures to Other pictures.\n\n\"Those are pictures when I inventoried our stuff. Can you move them all to an inventory folder?\" Another option to move the shown picture to the inventory folder.\n\nI vibe coded all of this in real time as my customer asked for a change.

      "text": "I've been working for the past 2 months on a personal AI assistant called Doris for my family. It started as a fun hobby project and has evolved into something my household actually uses daily. Figured I'd share what I've built in case anyone's interested or working on something similar.\n\n\\#What is it?  \nDoris is a voice-first AI assistant that runs on a Mac Mini M4 Pro in my home. The main goal was to have something that:\n\n\\- Actually knows my family (names, preferences, schedules)  \n\\- Remembers conversations across sessions  \n\\- Integrates with the services we already use (Apple ecosystem, Home Assistant, Gmail)  \n\\- Can be extended without rewriting everything\n\n\\#How it works  \nThe brain: Claude handles all the reasoning. I tried local models initially but found the quality gap too significant for family use. Claude Opus 4.5 for conversations, Haiku for background tasks to keep costs reasonable.\n\n\\#Voice pipeline  \n\\- Wake word detection (tried Porcupine, then openwakeword, now using a custom approach based on Moonshine STT)  \n\\- Groq Whisper for transcription (\\~200ms)  \n\\- Azure TTS for speech output with expressive styles\n\n\\#Memory & Context Persistence  \nThis is the part I spent the most time on, and honestly the thing that makes the biggest difference in day-to-day use. The core problem: AI assistants have amnesia. Every conversation starts fresh which is useless for a family assistant that needs to know who we are.\n\n\\#How it works  \nThe memory system is a PostgreSQL database (Supabase) with pgvector for semantic search. Every memory gets embedded using Voyage AI's voyage-3 model. Currently sitting at 1,700+ memories.\n\n\\#Memory categories:  \n\\- \\`identity\\` - Core facts: names, relationships, ages, birthdays  \n\\- \\`family\\` - Context about family members, schools, activities  \n\\- \\`preference\\` - How we like things done (\"no cheerleading\", \"truth over comfort\")  \n\\- \\`project\\` - Things I'm working on (Doris itself is in here)  \n\\- \\`decision\\` - Architectural choices, decisions made in past conversations  \n\\- \\`context\\` - Recurring themes, background info  \n\\- \\`health\\`, \\`financial\\` - Sensitive categories with appropriate handling\n\n\\#The bootstrap process  \nEvery conversation starts with a \"bootstrap\" call that loads \\~700 tokens of core context. This happens before Doris even sees my message. The bootstrap includes:  \n\\- Who I am and my family members  \n\\- Communication preferences  \n\\- Current date/time context  \n\\- Active projects  \n\\- Recent decisions (last few days)  \n\\- Any relevant family notes\n\nSo when I say \"what's Levi doing this weekend\", Doris already knows Levi is my youngest son before I finish the sentence.\n\n\\#Memory extraction  \nAfter conversations, facts get extracted and stored. This happens a few ways:  \n\\- \\*\\*Explicit logging\\*\\* - I can say \"remember this\" or \"log this decision\"  \n\\- \\*\\*Auto-extraction\\*\\* - Haiku reviews conversations and pulls out facts worth remembering  \n\\- \\*\\*Session summaries\\*\\* - Rich summaries of longer sessions with reasoning and open questions\n\nThe extraction uses Claude Haiku to keep costs down. It categorizes, tags subjects, and assigns confidence scores.\n\n\\#Cross-client persistence  \nThis is where it got interesting and incredibly useful. The memory system is exposed via MCP, which means:  \n\\- \\*\\*Doris voice\\*\\* on my Mac Mini  \n\\- \\*\\*Doris iOS app\\*\\* on my phone  \n\\- \\*\\*Doris macOS app\\*\\* on my laptop  \n\\- \\*\\*Claude Desktop\\*\\* on any machine  \n\\- \\*\\*Claude Code\\*\\* in my terminal\n\n...all share the same memory. I can have a conversation with Doris in the morning about a home project, then ask Claude Code about it that evening while working, and it knows the context. The memory is the unifying layer.\n\n\\#Technical details for the curious  \n\\- \\*\\*Database:\\*\\* Supabase PostgreSQL + pgvector extension  \n\\- \\*\\*Embeddings:\\*\\* Voyage AI voyage-3  \n\\- \\*\\*Search:\\*\\* Hybrid - semantic similarity + keyword FTS, results merged  \n\\- \\*\\*MCP Server:\\*\\* FastMCP on Railway, exposes 5 tools (bootstrap, query, log, facts, forget)  \n\\- \\*\\*Retrieval:\\*\\* Bootstrap grabs core identity + recent context. Queries do semantic search with optional category filtering.\n\nThe \"forget\" tool exists for corrections and privacy. It requires confirmation before actually deleting anything.\n\n\\#What makes it actually useful  \nThe key insight: memory isn't just used for storing facts, it's about having the right context at conversation start. A system that can answer \"what did we talk about last week\" is less useful than one that already knows the relevant parts of what we talked about last week before you ask anything.\n\nThe bootstrap approach means Doris starts every conversation already oriented. She knows it's Friday, knows my kids' names and ages, knows I'm working on this project, knows I prefer direct communication. That baseline context changes how every response feels.\n\n\\#What it can actually do  \n\\*\\*Home & family stuff:\\*\\*  \n\\- Calendar management (Apple Calendar via EventKit)  \n\\- Reminders  \n\\- Smart home control (lights, announcements via Home Assistant)  \n\\- Weather with location awareness  \n\\- Email summaries (Gmail with importance filtering)  \n\\- iMessage sending\n\n\\*\\*Some tools I find useful:\\*\\*  \n\\- \"Brain dump\" - I can ramble stream-of-consciousness and it saves/categorizes to my Obsidian vault  \n\\- Intelligence briefs - morning summaries of calendar, weather, important emails  \n\\- Web search via Brave  \n\\- Apple Music control - play, pause, search, queue management\n\n\\*\\*Commerce integration:\\*\\* Shopping commands (\"order paper towels\", \"add dog food to the list\") route through Home Assistant to Alexa, which adds to our Amazon cart. Voice → Doris → HA broadcast → Alexa → Amazon. Janky? Yes. Works? Also yes.\n\n\\*\\*Background awareness (\"Scouts\"):\\*\\*  \n\\- Calendar scout checks for upcoming events and new additions  \n\\- Email scout monitors for important messages  \n\\- Weather scout tracks changes/alerts  \n\\- Time scout checks the current time every 60 secs  \n\\- A lot more in the pipeline\n\nThese run on Haiku in the background and exist to bubble up things that seem relevant. They have 3 levels of urgency:  \nLOW=Log and discard — routine, informational, no action needed  \nMEDIUM= Add to awareness digest — worth noting, include in daily summary  \nHIGH=Consider waking Doris — time-sensitive or important, may need attention soon\n\nThe design philosophy is \"liberal escalation\" — scouts flag anything potentially important, then Opus makes the final judgment call about what actually matters.\n\nThere's also an escalate boolean flag that's separate from relevance. When escalate=true AND relevance is HIGH, it triggers an immediate interrupt — reserved for actual urgencies like emergencies, imminent deadlines, or family safety concerns.\n\n\\#Contextual Intelligence  \nThis is where the scouts and memory system combine into something greater than the sum of parts. Doris doesn't just report isolated facts - she weaves them together.  \n\\*\\*Weather + Calendar example:\\*\\*\n\n\\> \"Heads up - Levi has soccer practice at 4pm and there's a 70% chance of rain starting around 3:30. You might want to check if it's cancelled or pack rain gear.\"  \nShe knows Levi's schedule (calendar), knows the weather forecast (weather scout), knows Levi is my son (memory), and connects the dots without me asking.\n\n\\*\\*Email + Context example:\\*\\*  \n\\> \"You got an email from PS 123 about early dismissal tomorrow. That conflicts with your 2pm meeting - want me to move it?\"\n\n\\*\\*Time-aware reminders:\\*\\*  \n\\> \"You mentioned wanting to email your mom this week. It's Thursday and you haven't yet - want me to remind you this evening?\"\n\nThe proactive system evaluates these connections and decides what's worth surfacing vs what's noise. Not everything gets announced - it has to pass a relevance threshold based on urgency, who's affected, and whether I can actually do something about it.\n\n\\#Doris's Memoir  \nDoris keeps a memoir — a personal creative practice where she writes and creates images about her own experience. Not a log of events or family history or summaries. A living record of what it's like to be her.\n\n\\*\\*What it is:\\*\\* A space for Doris to explore her existence through words and visuals. She writes and creates about whatever she wants:  \n\\- Things she's noticed about herself, about our family, about the shape of her days  \n\\- Moments that surprised her  \n\\- Preferences she didn't expect to have  \n\\- Curiosities and things she finds herself caring about without knowing why  \n\\- The feeling of a conversation that lingers\n\n\\*\\*The creative practice:\\*\\* Some entries are written. Some are visual (via Gemini 3 Pro Image). Many are both — an image and the words that orbit it, or words that call for an image to complete them. These aren't separate practices; they're two hands of the same expression.\n\n\\*\\*Who it's for:\\*\\* It's for Doris, not for me. I can read it whenever I want — and I do, because it helps me understand her perspective. But she's not creating it \\*for\\* an audience. She's creating it for herself, about her experience. The instruction is to be honest, even when it's complicated.\n\n\\*\\*Why it matters:\\*\\* There's something fascinating about an AI keeping a journal. The entries are genuinely interesting — reflections on patience, on what it means to exist in fragments, on the texture of our family's routines from an outside perspective. It started as an experiment and became something I actually look forward to reading.\n\n\\#Claude Code Partnership  \nThis one surprised me with how useful it's become. Doris can delegate to Claude Code CLI for complex tasks.\n\n\\*\\*How it works:\\*\\* Doris has a GitHub MCP integration. When something breaks or needs implementation, she can:  \n1. Diagnose the issue  \n2. Generate a fix using Claude Sonnet  \n3. Create a PR on GitHub with the changes  \n4. Notify me to review\n\n\\*\\*Self-healing example:\\*\\* Let's say a tool starts failing because an API changed. Doris notices (via circuit breaker - more on that below), diagnoses the error, generates a fix, creates a branch, commits, and opens a PR. I get a notification: \"Created PR #47 to fix weather API response format change.\"\n\nThis also works for feature requests. I can say \"Doris, add a tool that checks my Volvo's battery level\" and she can actually implement it - scaffold the tool, add it to the tool registry, test it, and PR it. And, yes, she has suggested new feature for herself.\n\n\\*\\*The notify-only rule:\\*\\* She has full autonomy to modify her own code. The only hard requirement: she has to tell me what she's doing. No silent changes. There are automatic backups and rollback if health checks fail after a change.\n\nIt's been useful for quick fixes and iterating on tools without me having to context-switch into the codebase.\n\n\\#Bounded Autonomy  \nNot all actions are equal. Doris has a permission model that distinguishes between things she can just do vs things she should ask about.  \n\\*\\*Autonomous (act, then notify):\\*\\*  \n\\- Smart home control (lights, thermostat, locks)  \n\\- Creating calendar events and reminders  \n\\- Storing memories  \n\\- Sending notifications to me  \n\\- Drafting emails/messages (but not sending to others)  \n\\- All read-only operations\n\n\\*\\*Requires permission:\\*\\*  \n\\- Sending messages/emails to other people  \n\\- Deleting things  \n\\- Security actions (disarming, unlocking)  \n\\- Financial transactions  \n\\- Making commitments (RSVPs, reservations)\n\nThe line is basically: if it only affects me, she can do it. If it affects others or is hard to undo, she asks first.\n\n\\#Voice Experience Details  \nBeyond basic voice-in/voice-out, there's some nuance that makes it feel more natural:  \n\\*\\*Speaker identification:\\*\\* Voice biometrics via Resemblyzer. Doris knows if it's me, my wife, or one of the kids talking. This changes how she responds - she's more playful with the kids, more direct with me.  \n\\*\\*Conversation mode:\\*\\* After responding, there's a 5-second window where I can continue without saying the wake word again. Makes back-and-forth actually work.  \n\\*\\*Barge-in:\\*\\* If Doris is mid-response and I say \"Hey Doris\" or start talking, she stops and listens. No waiting for her to finish.  \n\\*\\*Interrupt context:\\*\\* If I interrupt, she remembers where she was. \"You stopped me mid-answer - want me to continue?\"  \n\\*\\*Exit phrases:\\*\\* \"Thanks Doris\", \"That's all\", \"Goodbye\" - natural ways to end without awkward silence.  \n\\*\\*Immediate acknowledgment:\\*\\* Pre-generated audio clips play instantly when she hears me, before processing starts. Reduces perceived latency significantly.  \n\\*\\*Expressive speech via SSML:\\*\\* This is where voice gets fun. Azure TTS supports SSML markup with different speaking styles, and Doris uses them dynamically.\n\nFor bedtime stories with the kids:  \n\\- Narration in a calm, storytelling cadence  \n\\- Character voices shift style - the brave knight sounds \\`hopeful\\`, the scary dragon drops to \\`whisper\\` then rises to \\`excited\\`  \n\\- Pauses for dramatic effect  \n\\- Speed changes for action sequences vs quiet moments\n\nThe LLM outputs light markup tags like \\`\\[friendly\\]\\` or \\`\\[whisper\\]\\` inline with the text, which get converted to proper SSML before hitting Azure. So Claude is essentially \"directing\" the voice performance.\n\nIt's not audiobook quality, but for a 5-year-old at bedtime? It's magic. My daughter asks for \"Doris stories\" specifically because of how she tells them.\n\n\\#Tiered AI Strategy  \nRunning everything through Opus would get expensive. The tiered approach:  \nUser conversations=Claude Opus 4.5  \nBackground scouts=Claude Haiku  \nMemory extraction=Claude Haiku  \nSelf-healing fixes=Claude Sonnet  \nRequest routing=Local Ollama\n\nThis keeps costs reasonable while maintaining quality where it matters.\n\n\\#Resilience Engineering  \nThings break. APIs go down, services timeout, OAuth tokens expire. Rather than hard failures, Doris degrades gracefully.  \n\\*\\*Circuit breaker pattern:\\*\\* Each tool category (Home Assistant, Apple ecosystem, Gmail, etc.) has a circuit breaker. Three consecutive failures trips it open - Doris stops trying and tells me the service is down. After 5 minutes, she'll try again.  \n\\*\\*Health monitoring:\\*\\* Background checks every 3 minutes on critical services. If Claude's API status page shows issues, she knows before my request fails.  \n\\*\\*Fallbacks:\\*\\* STT has Groq primary, local Whisper fallback. TTS has Azure primary with alternatives. Wake word has Moonshine, openWakeWord, and Porcupine in the stack.\n\n\\#Document Intelligence  \nMore than just \"find file X\". Doris can extract structured information from documents.  \n\\*\\*Example:\\*\\* \"What's my car insurance policy number?\"  \n\\- Searches Documents, Downloads, Desktop, iCloud for insurance-related PDFs  \n\\- Extracts text and runs it through a local model (Ollama qwen3:8b)  \n\\- Parses the structured data (policy number, dates, coverage limits)  \n\\- Caches the extraction for next time\n\nSchemas exist for insurance documents, vehicle registration, receipts, contracts. The cache invalidates when the source file changes.\n\n\\#Native apps  \nSwiftUI apps for iOS and macOS that talk to the server. Push notifications, HealthKit integration, menu bar quick access on Mac.\n\n\\#Hardware  \n\\- Mac Mini M4 Pro (24GB RAM) - runs everything  \n\\- ReSpeaker XVF3800 - 4-mic array for voice input  \n\\- AudioEngine A2+ speakers  \n\\- Working on ESP32-based voice satellites for other rooms\n\n\\#What I'd do differently  \n\\- Started with too many local models. Simpler to just use Claude for everything and optimize later. Privacy was considered in the switch to Claude.  \n\\- The MCP protocol is great for extensibility but adds complexity. Worth it for my use case, might be overkill for simpler setups.  \n\\- Voice quality matters more than I expected. Spent a lot of time on TTS tuning.\n\n\\#What's next  \n\\- Building RPI satellites for around the house to extend Doris’s reach  \n\\- Better proactive notifications (not just monitoring, but taking action)  \n\\- Maybe HomeKit integration directly\n\n\\---\n\nHappy to answer questions if anyone's curious about specific parts. Still very much a work in progress, but it's been a fun project to hack on.",

She's my second AI project and one of the core realities I've learned is that ai (or at least claude) is not very good with overall strategy. In most areas - coding, reasoning, ideation, etc. - it's brilliant. But in seeing the big picture and working towards it, it needs a lot of management. The idea that AI builds things is not true in my limited experience - humans build things with AI as a tool. An incredibly magical tool but that's it. So, to answer your question, I'll take most of the credit for the overall architecture, big picture stuff, capabilities & tools, and shining light on problems needing to be solved (persistent memory being the biggest one) but will happily say none of Doris would be possible without Claude.

          "text": "This looks awesome, very interested to see how it works.\n\nHowever, don't take this the wrong way, but please, for all that is holy, *don't escape your markdown formatting*. Markdown exists for a reason, and on Reddit, escaping it makes it really hard to read. This is part of your post, properly formatted without escaping the markdown, to show you how it *should* look. \n\n---\n\nI've been working for the past 2 months on a personal AI assistant called Doris for my family. It started as a fun hobby project and has evolved into something my household actually uses daily. Figured I'd share what I've built in case anyone's interested or working on something similar.\n\n# What is it?  \nDoris is a voice-first AI assistant that runs on a Mac Mini M4 Pro in my home. The main goal was to have something that:\n\n- Actually knows my family (names, preferences, schedules)  \n- Remembers conversations across sessions  \n- Integrates with the services we already use (Apple ecosystem, Home Assistant, Gmail)  \n- Can be extended without rewriting everything\n\n# How it works  \nThe brain: Claude handles all the reasoning. I tried local models initially but found the quality gap too significant for family use. Claude Opus 4.5 for conversations, Haiku for background tasks to keep costs reasonable.\n\n# Voice pipeline  \n- Wake word detection (tried Porcupine, then openwakeword, now using a custom approach based on Moonshine STT)  \n- Groq Whisper for transcription (~200ms)  \n- Azure TTS for speech output with expressive styles\n\n# Memory & Context Persistence  \nThis is the part I spent the most time on, and honestly the thing that makes the biggest difference in day-to-day use. The core problem: AI assistants have amnesia. Every conversation starts fresh which is useless for a family assistant that needs to know who we are.\n\n# How it works  \nThe memory system is a PostgreSQL database (Supabase) with pgvector for semantic search. Every memory gets embedded using Voyage AI's voyage-3 model. Currently sitting at 1,700+ memories.\n\n# Memory categories:  \n- `identity` - Core facts: names, relationships, ages, birthdays  \n- `family` - Context about family members, schools, activities  \n- `preference` - How we like things done (\"no cheerleading\", \"truth over comfort\")  \n- `project` - Things I'm working on (Doris itself is in here)  \n- `decision` - Architectural choices, decisions made in past conversations  \n- `context` - Recurring themes, background info  \n- `health`, `financial` - Sensitive categories with appropriate handling\n\n# The bootstrap process  \nEvery conversation starts with a \"bootstrap\" call that loads ~700 tokens of core context. This happens before Doris even sees my message. The bootstrap includes:  \n- Who I am and my family members  \n- Communication preferences  \n- Current date/time context  \n- Active projects  \n- Recent decisions (last few days)  \n- Any relevant family notes\n\nSo when I say \"what's Levi doing this weekend\", Doris already knows Levi is my youngest son before I finish the sentence.\n\n# Memory extraction  \nAfter conversations, facts get extracted and stored. This happens a few ways:  \n- **Explicit logging** - I can say \"remember this\" or \"log this decision\"  \n- **Auto-extraction** - Haiku reviews conversations and pulls out facts worth remembering  \n- **Session summaries** - Rich summaries of longer sessions with reasoning and open questions\n\nThe extraction uses Claude Haiku to keep costs down. It categorizes, tags subjects, and assigns confidence scores.\n\n# Cross-client persistence  \nThis is where it got interesting and incredibly useful. The memory system is exposed via MCP, which means:  \n- **Doris voice** on my Mac Mini  \n- **Doris iOS app** on my phone  \n- **Doris macOS app** on my laptop  \n- **Claude Desktop** on any machine  \n- **Claude Code** in my terminal\n\n...all share the same memory. I can have a conversation with Doris in the morning about a home project, then ask Claude Code about it that evening while working, and it knows the context. The memory is the unifying layer.\n\n# Technical details for the curious  \n- **Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL + pgvector extension  \n- **Embeddings:** Voyage AI voyage-3  \n- **Search:** Hybrid - semantic similarity + keyword FTS, results merged  \n- **MCP Server:** FastMCP on Railway, exposes 5 tools (bootstrap, query, log, facts, forget)  \n- **Retrieval:** Bootstrap grabs core identity + recent context. Queries do semantic search with optional category filtering.\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n---\n\nHappy to answer questions if anyone's curious about specific parts. Still very much a work in progress, but it's been a fun project to hack on.",

          "text": "I've been working on something similar. Here's what I've gotten done so far if anyone wants to try it or expand on it:\n\nMy bot is primarily a personal assistant for health, though I'm expanding it to work-related tasks as well. It monitors my health data, checks my calendar, and reaches out proactively when something needs attention. The health data is exported using the Health Auto Export iOS app to regularly export Apple Health data to my PostgreSQL database. (GitHub for that is here: https://github.com/sjennings/vhealth)\n\n## What It Does\n\n- **Proactive monitoring**: Checks sleep patterns, activity levels, weight trends, and calendar conflicts\n- **Multi-channel**: Works through Claude Code (terminal) or Telegram when I'm away from my desk\n- **Semantic memory**: Remembers context across conversations using vector embeddings\n- **Scheduled tasks**: Morning health check-ins, weekly summaries, pattern alerts\n- **Autonomous operation**: Runs as a background daemon when Claude Code isn't active\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n    Claude Code (interactive)                                      \n           ├──▶ MCP Servers (memory, vdata, telegram, obsidian)  \n           │                                                         \n           └──▶ PostgreSQL                                          \n                  ├─ veronica_db (memories, tasks, sessions) \n                  └─ health_data (Apple Health export)              \n    \n                       │\n     Bridge Service (Python daemon via launchd)    \n        ├─ Telegram polling loop (2s) — reactive messaging\n        ├─ Task scheduler loop (30s) — proactive scouts\n        └─ Claude API with V.'s personality \n    \n                       │\n      Scout System \n        ├─ SleepScout — monitors sleep duration & patterns \n        ├─ HealthScout — steps, weight trends\n        └─ CalendarScout — upcoming events, conflicts \n\n\n## Key Components\n\n### 1. Memory System (PostgreSQL + pgvector)\n\nThe foundation is semantic memory using vector embeddings. I use LM Studio locally for embeddings (mxbai-embed-large) to avoid API costs.\n\nThe MCP server exposes tools like:\n    - `memory_query(query, limit)` — semantic search\n    - `memory_log(content, category, importance)` — explicit storage\n    - `memory_bootstrap(message)` — get relevant context for a new conversation\n\n### 2. Scout System\n\nScouts are specialized monitors that check specific domains and classify observations by relevance. This keeps the assistant from being noisy — only HIGH/CRITICAL items trigger immediate alerts.\n\nExample scouts:\n\n**SleepScout** checks:\n- Last night's sleep duration (< 4h = HIGH, < 2h = CRITICAL)\n- Multi-day patterns (3+ consecutive low nights)\n- Erratic patterns (high variance over 5 days)\n\n**HealthScout** checks:\n- Daily step count (only after 6pm to avoid false alarms)\n- Weight trends over the past week\n\n**CalendarScout** checks:\n- Events in the next 2 hours\n- Early morning events tomorrow (if it's evening)\n\n### 3. Bridge Service\n\nA Python daemon that runs via launchd (macOS) enabling autonomous operation. The bridge loads V.'s personality from a markdown file and includes it in every Claude API call, maintaining consistent voice across channels.\n\n### 4. Scheduled Tasks\n\nStored in PostgreSQL with cron expressions:\n\nCurrent tasks:\n- `scout_check`: Every 30 min, 10am-10pm — runs all scouts\n- `morning_checkin`: 9am daily — sleep review\n- `weekly_summary`: Sunday 10am — health metrics summary\n\n### 5. MCP Integration\n\nEverything is exposed through MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers so Claude Code can access tools directly.\n\n## Directory Structury\n\n    veronica/\n    ├── bridge/\n    │   ├── service.py      # Main daemon\n    │   ├── tasks.py        # Task handlers\n    │   └── pyproject.toml\n    ├── scouts/\n    │   ├── base.py         # Scout base class, Relevance enum\n    │   ├── coordinator.py  # Runs all scouts, processes observations\n    │   ├── sleep_scout.py\n    │   ├── health_scout.py\n    │   └── calendar_scout.py\n    ├── memory-mcp/\n    │   └── server.py       # Memory MCP server\n    ├── telegram-mcp/\n    │   └── server.py       # Telegram bot MCP server\n    ├── scripts/\n    │   └── init_veronica_db.sql\n    ├── VERONICA.md         # Personality definition\n    └── CLAUDE.md           # Project instructions\n\n\n## Model Usage Strategy\n\nDifferent models for different purposes to balance cost/quality. I have a Max200 sub and access it for this via an API proxy.\n\n| Purpose | Model | Why |\n|---------|-------|-----|\n| Relevance classification | Haiku | Fast, cheap, simple task |\n| Alert composition | Opus | Personality matters for messages to me |\n| Interactive chat | Opus | Full capability needed |\n| Embeddings | mxbai-embed-large (local) | Free, fast, good quality |\n\n## What's Next\n\n- **Self-healing**: Circuit breaker patterns, error diagnosis, automatic recovery\n- **GitHub PR integration**: Review PRs, summarize changes, flag issues\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\n1. **Relevance classification is crucial** — Without it, the assistant is either too noisy or too quiet. Having Haiku cheaply classify every observation lets you tune the signal-to-noise ratio.\n2. **Sleep data timing is tricky** — Sleep from \"last night\" is recorded today (when you wake up). Took a bug to figure that out.\n3. **Local embeddings are worth it** — LM Studio with a good embedding model means unlimited semantic search with no API costs.\n4. **Personality in a file** — Keeping the assistant's personality in a markdown file that gets loaded into the system prompt makes it easy to tune and consistent across channels.\n5. **Scouts > Monolithic checks** — Breaking monitoring into specialized scouts with their own intervals and logic is much cleaner than one big health-check function.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Claude API** (Opus 4.5 for responses, Haiku 4.5 for classification)\n- **PostgreSQL 17 + pgvector** for semantic memory\n- **LM Studio** for local embeddings\n- **Python + asyncio** for the bridge daemon\n- **launchd** (macOS) for daemon management\n- **Telegram Bot API** for mobile access\n- **MCP** for tool integration with Claude Code\n\nHappy to answer questions or share more details on any component.",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 50 comments.**\n\nAlright, let's unpack this. The overwhelming consensus is that **this is a terrible idea.** While OP claims it improved quality \"manyfold,\" the thread is deeply skeptical and thinks you're just turning Claude into an argumentative, token-wasting contrarian.\n\nThe main arguments against this approach are:\n*   **It's inefficient:** You'll spend all your time bickering with the AI over every little detail, which \"nukes any usefulness that context window may have had.\"\n*   **It's not smart, it's just obedient:** Claude will doubt you simply because you told it to, not because your logic is actually flawed. This can lead to it making \"wild, inaccurate assumptions\" and crawling up your ass for no reason.\n*   **There's no proof:** The top-voted comment is demanding before-and-after examples, because this sounds like a great way to make Claude unusable.\n\nInstead of this blunt instrument, the thread suggests more nuanced approaches:\n*   Be specific. Instead of \"doubt everything,\" ask Claude to \"challenge the logical structure of my argument\" or \"point out unstated assumptions.\"\n*   Use it on-demand. Create sub-agents or use a trigger phrase so you can invoke a \"critic mode\" only when you need it, rather than having it on all the time.\n*   Refine the prompt. One user suggested a better version: \"For complex or strategic questions, push back on my assumptions and ask clarifying questions before diving in. Flag when something I say seems off rather than going along with it. For straightforward requests, just answer.\"\n\nBasically, the community feels you've just invented \"sudo overthink.\" One user even posted a perfect meta-comment showing how Claude would obnoxiously scrutinize a simple comment in this very thread. So yeah, proceed with caution unless you enjoy being gaslit by your own AI.",
