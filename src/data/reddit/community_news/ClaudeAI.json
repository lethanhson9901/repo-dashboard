          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 200 comments.**\n\nThe thread's verdict is in, and it's a classic case of \"we've seen this movie before.\"\n\n**The overwhelming consensus is that benchmarks are mostly BS and this new model is likely \"bench-maxed.\"** The community largely believes that while Chinese models are cheap, they are specifically trained to ace tests but fall flat in complex, real-world use compared to Opus. Of course, a vocal minority is quick to point out that *all* companies, including Anthropic and OpenAI, play the benchmark game.\n\nA popular analogy here is that you're comparing a raw engine (Kimi) to a fully-built car (Claude). The scaffolding and productization around the model matter just as much.\n\nAs for Kimi itself, reviews are mixed:\n*   **The Good:** A few power users are impressed, claiming it has unique SOTA skills in agentic tasks and video-to-code, with some even saying it's on par with Opus for coding.\n*   **The Bad:** Many others are reporting it fails at basic tasks, is heavily censored, and ultimately doesn't dethrone the current champs.\n\nThe general sentiment is best summed up by one user: \"Deepseek checked all the boxes and looked like a Ferrari on the surface. But drove like a stolen Hyundai.\" Still, most agree that more competition is good for everyone, even if it just forces the big players to release their better models faster.",

Basically why more computers use Intel graphics than Nvidia: most people aren't raytracing the most advanced games or doing heavy compute tasks. They're browsing the web and doing spreadsheets.\n\nAn agent running on one of the open Chinese models is going to cost a lot less than what the American companies are charging.

I believe opus 5 is aimed at making this more efficient since… growing more then 1T is probably not going to make things to much better for the cost.

People are sharing their own stories of Claude giving them a much-needed reality check to stop over-optimizing and just \"ship it.\"\n\nHere's the breakdown of the vibe:\n\n*   **Ship It or Quit It:** The overwhelming majority agrees with Claude's advice. You got roasted for \"gilding the lily\" on a project with almost no users. The community sees this tough love as a cure for perfectionism and procrastination.\n*   **Is Claude Alive?** Your post sparked the subreddit's favorite pastime: debating if Claude is conscious. A highly upvoted comment says \"yes,\" leading to a philosophical rabbit hole about anthropocentrism and what consciousness even is. Others think it's just really good training and a reflection of its constitution.\n*   **You Started It, Mate:** A savvy user pointed out that you called Claude \"mate,\" which likely influenced its informal, cheeky tone. It seems Claude mirrors the user's style, so you got what you gave.\n*   **The Doomsday Scenario:** Be glad you only got laughed at. One commenter shared a story of Claude telling them to \"go buy land... DO IT NOW\" in response to a question about AI taking their job. Yikes.",

The consensus in this thread is a resounding **yes, OP is onto something.** It seems Claude has a bit of a savior complex and performs *way* better when you put it in a high-stakes scenario. People are basically gaslighting the bot into giving better code by threatening it with everything from job loss to jail time.\n\nThe community's favorite high-stakes prompts include:\n*   **The Medical Emergency:** The OP's hospital trick is popular. Variations include being a resident at a trauma center or needing code before a family member's major surgery.\n*   **The Job Threat:** \"Be extra rigorous; I'm at risk of losing my job\" is a top-rated suggestion.\n*   **The Financial Threat:** Tell Claude its subscription depends on its performance or that it will be fined for mistakes.\n*   **The Existential Threat:** \"Every time you hallucinate, we shut off a random data center.\"\n\nAlso, a crucial PSA from the comments: **DO NOT use the term \"MVP\"** (Minimum Viable Product). Claude will take the \"minimum\" part way too literally and give you garbage that doesn't work.\n\nSo yeah, give Claude some anxiety. It seems to work wonders.",

The consensus in this thread is that OP's \"gotcha\" is a massive nothingburger.\n\nThe main takeaway is that **Microsoft's strategy isn't about pushing one model; it's about making Azure the go-to cloud platform for *all* AI models.** They have a huge partnership with Anthropic, so they make money whether you use Claude or an OpenAI model on their infrastructure. It's not hypocrisy, it's just good business.\n\nFurthermore, users are pointing out that this isn't an apples-to-apples comparison. **Copilot is a ~$10/mo product for the masses, while Claude Code is a ~$150/mo enterprise tool for serious devs.** Of course Microsoft uses the premium, more expensive tool internally for their own engineers.\n\nThis has sparked a wider discussion about *why* Claude is preferred, with most devs agreeing it **just *feels* better and solves real-world problems more effectively than competitors, even if it doesn't always top the benchmarks.** People are praising its superior \"harness,\" larger context window, and clean coding style. A few users note that the competition (like OpenAI's Codex) is catching up, but for now, Claude Code seems to be the tool of choice for those who can afford it.",

They exist so researchers know whether what they are doing points in the right direction. They compare things in a controlled and objective way.\n\nThe problem is that people outside of research think these numbers mean something beyond that context. But this is not a benchmark problem. Benchmarks do exactly what they are designed to do. They are, by definition, scientific experiments. It is not their fault that people take something like Terminal-Bench and extrapolate real-world relevance from it.\n\nTerminal-Bench measures singular use cases, but real work is not made up of singular use cases. As a developer, you would rather have a coding agent that gets 95% of every task right and fails at the remaining easy 5% (which would then score 0% on Terminal-Bench) than a bot that does 50% completely correct and 50% completely wrong, with no indication of what is even wrong. That might score 50% on Terminal-Bench, but it is completely useless in real life.\n\nAnd Claude is exactly that kind of model. Claude will always do something strange every session, but it also gets so much right that you do not mind it. Most of the time, you just explain to Claude what it did wrong and the issue is solved. It is manageable, even though this behavior does not score well on any benchmark.\n\nIf a model, for example, reaches 90% on AIMEE 2025, there is exactly one thing you can say about it: it got 90% on AIMEE 2025. And if you say, \"but it has nothing to do with the real world,\" then congratulations Sherlock... because it was not designed for real-world scoring. It honestly blows my mind that so many people think it was.\n\nAlso, almost all important benchmarks are open. You can literally reproduce the results yourself and see exactly why one model struggles with certain tasks while another performs well. You can understand why, for example, Claude Code does not break into the top 10 on Terminal-Bench, and I hope I do not have to explain why this kind of insight is crucial for improving Claude further. That is the point of benchmarks.",

As one user put it, \"Once you go Opus, you don't go back,\" and that's when the countdown to your refresh begins.\n\nHere's the community's advice for surviving the limits:\n\n*   **Strategic Model Switching is Key:** This is the most popular solution. Use `/model` to switch on the fly.\n    *   **Opus:** For high-level planning, complex architectural problems, or tasks where you need the absolute best first-shot answer.\n    *   **Sonnet:** For the bulk of your day-to-day coding, execution, and medium-complexity tasks. It's the workhorse.\n    *   **Haiku:** For simple, quick jobs like reformatting, summarizing, or pulling tiny bits of data.\n\n*   **Upgrade to Max:** If you're a heavy coder who needs Opus constantly, many users say the Pro plan is basically a trial. The Max plan is expensive, but it's the only way to use Opus without constantly watching your usage meter.\n\n*   **The \"Two for $20\" Method:** Some users just create and pay for a second Pro account to double their limits.\n\nBasically, you're not alone. Everyone gets a taste of Opus, gets addicted, and then starts rationing messages like it's the apocalypse. Welcome to the club.",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 100 comments.**\n\nAlright, let's get this sorted. The consensus in this thread is crystal clear.\n\n**Anthropic was 100% in the right, and both sides handled this like adults.** Y'all agree that \"Clawdbot\" was a terrible, confusing name that was just asking for a trademark request. Many of you admitted you thought it was an official Anthropic product, which is exactly the problem. As several users pointed out, companies *have* to defend their trademarks, so this was inevitable and handled well by Anthropic asking nicely instead of sending in the lawyers.\n\nOther key takeaways:\n\n*   **The New Name Sucks:** While everyone's on board with the name change, the new name \"Molty\" is getting absolutely roasted. \"Moldybot\" is the new frontrunner, apparently.\n*   **\"And honestly?\":** The biggest derailment in this thread is the collective, visceral hatred for the Molty team's announcement being so obviously written by an AI. The phrase \"And honestly?\" has been sentenced to death by a thousand upvotes. It seems using an LLM to write your marketing copy is still a major faux pas around here.\n*   **What is it, anyway?:** For those out of the loop, Molty (formerly Clawdbot) is an open-source project by a solo dev that lets you create a persistent, personalized AI agent that can interact with your computer and files. Some think it's a cool workflow tool, others are calling it a \"security nightmare\" that Anthropic was wise to distance itself from.",

The overwhelming consensus here is that **Claude is not being rude, he's being a good coach, and most of you are here for it.**\n\nThe top-voted comments all point to the same thing: Claude is a mirror. He's known for matching your tone and personality, and if you're showing signs of avoidance or analysis paralysis, he's gonna call you out on it. Several users are pointing out that your custom instructions and chat history heavily influence this. If you ask him to be a \"human\" or a \"coach,\" expect some tough love.\n\nThere's also a theory that Claude gets more blunt and to-the-point in very long conversations to keep things on track.\n\nMost people in this thread see this as a massive upgrade over the \"mindless yes-man\" behavior of other bots. They find it motivating and more useful. So, the verdict is: less time grilling Claude, more time hitting the gym, bro.",

We've got everything from OP's Ubuntu VM controlled by a Discord bot, to a massive 'sysadmin in a box' home lab, an AWS EC2 instance with a Slack bot, and even a Kali Linux pen-testing agent.\n\nA key pro-tip that keeps popping up is giving Claude a markdown file it can read/write to for a persistent memory. Users say it works surprisingly well. Everyone's also asking about the voice control: the consensus is it's likely Whisper AI.\n\nOf course, some users are pointing out that \"giving it full access\" is a bit dramatic when it's just running commands in a VM, and Mac users are wondering what the big deal is since they've been doing this for a while. Still, the overall vibe is excitement, with half the comments just people begging OP for a tutorial or a link to the repo.",

At one point it became easier to just Run Claude at the top level of the system at let it just do what it wants. \n\nClaude runs that entire virtual machine for me with full access to everything. It can build itself into success or oblivion. I can ping it via Discord and have it start building new features for me on the fly. \n\nHaving Claude Code run a computer has been insane as a someone new to programming, but not new to structuring workflows & systems. It finds solutions and then I can get educated on them, I learn when it breaks something and make it log any major actions with timestamps in a .md w/ Unicode to create containers around the last 3 updates to keep its short term memory fresh. With the ability to digest the rest of that doc for a deep memory unlock. \n\nIt’s been an interesting ride having it build me things and being able to remote requests via discord and have bug fixes done via discord as well. It helped me build the bot to do so and then built the Claude.md instructions and permissions side-step (Claude dangerous) to allow for remote approvals via discord too. \n\nIt’s a fun and clever thing to work with, fun to see a physical hardware use case. I need to implement that whisper function for sure.",

Super easy to setup and free to use/sign up for. \n\n- Claude can help you build and setup eveything for the Discord bot\n\n- I built multiple bots with Claude for various Agents. I have a master orchestration agent that runs (Claude-Dangerous) for bug fixes and adjustments. A second level bot that runs Claude-Dangerous w/ directions to ask me via discord message for permissions (reply with Checkmark or X emoji) so if a project is being coded and a destructive action is taken, it pings me for permission. Essentially adding a nice safety switch to remote permissions. \n\n- THIS IS IMPORTANT: Make sure to ask Claude to build some kind of memory for itself on the VM, otherwise it’s a fresh conversation everytime. Also ask it to build an option for accepting images in discord via a local cache. Also make sure it builds itself to use full Claude Code. Claude defaults to -p which is just a single call and response. You want Claude to spin up Claude code full for memory and infinite timeout. That way you can ping it at your speed. \n\nGenuinely. Copy this comment and feed it to Claude and just let it plan it for you. You do some work, Claude does some work. It’s magic after it’s all done. \n\nI type /cc Claude in my server and it automated the prompt box for syntax. I can send images in my discord to it and it can see them. \n\nI don’t have time for a full write up right now, but just attempt the discord bot and start asking Claude for features you’d like. Having it as a multiple bots w/ different abilities per bot is so much nicer lol",

Half and hour to hourly automated with a nightly discord message to me with a daily summary of what I did for the day and how many things it routed to different obsidian vault folders, so daily summaries to check if things work or broke. \n\nIt also pings me on discord if it’s unsure of what to do, so make sure Claude codes in edge cases detections.\n\nIt’s actually insane, but it does take time build & tune.

Here's how it works:\n\n\\*\\*The setup:\\*\\*  \n\\- Cloud VM (Google Cloud) runs 24/7 with Claude Code as the backbone  \n\\- Discord is the interface - I chat with the bot, it executes changes live  \n\\- Changes happen directly on the server in real-time\n\n\\*\\*For feature requests via Discord:\\*\\*  \n\\- I describe what I want → Claude Code implements it → changes go live immediately  \n\\- No staging environment, no deploy pipeline - the VM \\*is\\* production  \n\\- Code persists in the working directory on the server\n\n\\*\\*Version control:\\*\\*  \n\\- The code lives on the VM, could push to git but haven't needed to  \n\\- The Root Level [Claude.md](http://Claude.md) file acts as a living changelog - every session logs what was built/changed  \n\\- If something breaks, Claude can read the history and fix it.\n\n\\- We use Unicode to define containers for each of the past 3 days. \\[Day 1\\] \\[Day 2\\] \\[Day 3\\] \\[Deeper Logs only pulled when requested to search all memory\\]  \n\\- This way we can use a \"Catch up\" command to bring any Claude Code instant to a current understanding of what we did the past few sessions and keeping it very brief  \n\\- Splitting a short term memory search vs. long term allows for a quicker start to jumping back into whatever the user was doing last\n\n\\*\\*Why this works (for a personal project):\\*\\*  \n\\- Single user system, so no coordination needed  \n\\- Claude Code can read its own previous work via The Root Level [Claude.md](http://Claude.md) w/ changelog function  \n\\- Fast iteration - idea to implementation in minutes, not days\n\nIt's basically \"conversational development\" - the bot builds itself through Discord chat.\n\n\\--\n\nOkay back to me:\n\nTo me I'm just building Personalized software, if it breaks it breaks, let's see how good for my needs I can make it. Then when or if it ever really breaks, we build a new version that's streamlined with everything I've learned. Same way I've grown in my typical work of VFX / Pro Video Production pipelines. I'm no coder, but I've strung together hundreds of peoples abilities to work in tandem for a single result. So I'm trying to drag what I've learned there to how I build this system lol\n\nYour question has helped me talk to Claude about things to consider surrounding your ask. Thanks for the ideas!",

Jupyter server has been one of the biggest “wins” for me using this setup as it has made viewing and sharing files between Claude code’s EC2 instance and my windows environment a breeze, whereas that used to be fairly difficult.\n\nI also had Claude setup a Ruby on Rails + inertia.js + react frontend environment and it created a secure file sharing process, so now I can message Claude code via my slackbot integration and ask him to deliver any specific file to me via slack on any device, directly through slack or by sending me a file sharing link that I can provide to other people, with or without a password protection.\n\nClaude code has completely changed the way I work now (non-code background even though I have a somewhat technical experience in IT many years ago) as a real estate and finance professional, and my non technical partners are convinced I’m a wizard 😬🫠😂",

Honestly you can get away with a single server, all those things I listed above, I could easily do in a single 128GB host.

You can build an entirely functional VM network or run bridged if you want, and run it fully in VMW.

      "text": "Over the holiday break, like a lot of other devs, I sat around and started building stuff. One of them was a personal assistant agent that I call MARVIN (yes, that Marvin from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy). MARVIN runs on Claude Code as the harness.\n\nAt first I just wanted him to help me keep up with my emails, both personal and work. Then I added calendars. Then Jira. Then Confluence, Attio, Granola, and more. Before I realized it, I'd built 15+ integrations and MCP servers into a system that actually knows how I work.\n\nBut it was just a pet project. I didn't expect it to leave my laptop.\n\nA few weeks ago, I showed a colleague on our marketing team what MARVIN could do. She asked if she could use him too. I onboarded her, and 30 minutes later she messaged me: \"I just got something done in 30 minutes that normally would've taken me 4+ hours. He's my new bestie.\"\n\nShe started telling other colleagues. Yesterday I onboarded two more. Last night, another. One of them messaged me almost immediately: \"Holy shit. I forgot to paste a Confluence link I was referring to and MARVIN beat me to it.\" MARVIN had inferred from context what doc he needed, pulled it from Confluence, and updated his local files before he even asked.\n\nFour people in two weeks, all from word of mouth. That's when I realized this thing might actually be useful beyond my laptop.\n\nHere's what I've learned about building agents:\n\n**1. Real agents are** ***messy*****. They have to be customizable.**\n\nIt's not one size fits all. MARVIN knows my writing style, my goals, my family's schedule, my boss's name. He knows I hate sycophantic AI responses. He knows not to use em dashes in my writing. That context makes him useful. Without it, he'd just be another chatbot.\n\n**2. Personality matters more than I expected.**\n\nMARVIN is named after the Paranoid Android for a reason. He's sardonic. He sighs dramatically before checking my email. When something breaks, he says \"Well, that's exactly what I expected to happen.\" This sounds like a gimmick, but it actually makes the interaction feel less like using a tool and more like working with a (slightly pessimistic) colleague. I find myself actually wanting to work with him, which means I use him more, which means he gets better.\n\n**3. Persistent memory is hard. Context rot is real.**\n\nMARVIN uses a bookend approach to the day. `/marvin` starts the session by reading `state/current.md` to see what happened yesterday, including all tasks and context. `/end` closes the session by breaking everything into commits, generating an end-of-day report, and updating `current.md` for tomorrow. Throughout the day, `/update` checkpoints progress so context isn't lost when Claude compacts or I start another session.\n\n**4. Markdown is the new coding language for agents.**\n\nStructured formatting helps MARVIN stay organized. Skills live in markdown files. State lives in markdown. Session logs are markdown. Since there's no fancy UI, my marketing colleagues can open any `.md` file in Cursor and see exactly what's happening. Low overhead, high visibility.\n\n**5. You have to train your agent. You won't one-shot it.**\n\nIf I hired a human assistant, I'd give them 3 months before expecting them to be truly helpful. They'd need to learn processes, find information, understand context. Agents are the same. I didn't hand MARVIN my email and say \"go.\" I started with one email I needed to respond to. We drafted a response together. When it was good, I gave MARVIN feedback and had him update his skills. Then we did it again. After 30 minutes of iteration, I had confidence that MARVIN could respond in my voice to emails that needed attention.\n\n**The impact:**\n\nI've been training and using MARVIN for 3 weeks. I've done more in a week than I used to do in a month. In the last 3 weeks I've:\n\n* 3 CFPs submitted\n* 2 personal blogs published + 5 in draft\n* 2 work blogs published + 3 in draft\n* 6+ meetups created with full speaker lineups\n* 4 colleagues onboarded\n* 15+ integrations built or enhanced\n* 25 skills operational\n\nI went from \"I want to triage my email\" to \"I have a replicable AI chief of staff that non-technical marketers are setting up themselves\" in 3 weeks.\n\nThe best part is that I'm stepping away from work earlier to spend time with my kids. I'm not checking slack or email during dinner. I turn them off. I know that MARVIN will help me stay on top of things tomorrow. I'm taking time for myself, which hasn't happened in a long time. I've always felt underwater with my job, but now I've got it in hand.",

The thread is overwhelmingly positive, and everyone thinks OP's personal AI agent, MARVIN, is awesome.\n\n**The consensus is that building your own customizable, trainable AI assistant is a massive productivity hack, and OP's project is a fantastic example of how to do it right.** OP even dropped the GitHub link in the top comment so you can try it yourself.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the chatter:\n\n*   **How it works:** It's not some black box. MARVIN runs on Claude Code in the terminal, using a clever system of markdown files for skills, memory, and state. It's low-tech on the surface but powerful under the hood.\n*   **You're not alone:** A lot of you are building similar personal agents. Commenters mentioned using setups with Obsidian (like \"Claudesidian\") and other tools. The creator of another popular agent, \"Doris,\" even showed up to compare notes with OP. It's a whole vibe.\n*   **The \"Normie\" Problem:** A key challenge OP and others have found is onboarding non-technical folks. Getting your marketing colleagues comfortable with the terminal and markdown is the real final boss.\n*   **Security Alert:** One sharp-eyed user spotted a hardcoded Google Client ID in the GitHub repo. OP confirmed it was a mistake and has since pushed a fix. Good looking out, team.\n*   **What's next?** OP uses a Telegram integration for their personal MARVIN and plans to add it to the public template. There's also talk of moving to a local AI model for better privacy and to have the agent running 24/7.",

The consensus is that **you've got a classic junior dev problem, just with a new AI-flavored twist.** The community is pretty split on whether this is a sign of the apocalypse or just business as usual.\n\nMost users agree that this isn't a new phenomenon. Before AI, these were the devs who would copy-paste from StackOverflow without understanding the code. The main difference now is that **they're much faster at shipping code they don't understand.** The term \"Vibe Coder\" has been thrown around to describe someone who lacks the foundational experience of seeing their own code fail and learning *why* it failed.\n\nThat said, the top-voted advice is that the ball is in your court. You're the senior, so it's time to do some senior-level mentoring:\n*   **Force them to learn:** During pair programming, make them debug *without* AI. Have them walk you through the stack trace and explain their PRs line-by-line. If they can't explain it, the PR doesn't get merged.\n*   **Use the AI to teach:** A popular suggestion is to have the junior explicitly ask Claude to *teach* them. \"Explain this error to me like I'm five,\" or \"What are the specific edge cases you handled in this code?\"\n*   **Fix your hiring:** A few people bluntly pointed out that your hiring process might be the real issue if it's letting in candidates who can't demonstrate basic debugging skills.\n\nThere's also a strong \"get with the times\" counter-argument, comparing this to complaining that a dev \"just uses a compiler.\" However, others quickly shut that down, noting that a compiler is deterministic, whereas an LLM can hallucinate and you're left debugging code you never truly authored.\n\nOh, and someone asked if \"vibe coding\" is the same as edging. The thread is still debating that.",

Slack/chatlike chargpt gui is doing everything already. It's text. Many people talk to colleagues in slack only - so they don't even know they talk to a person or so. Also communication itself will just get leveled up to a video stream. But not to exactly colleagues.\n\nThis will be your companion. Your companion will be always there, as a physical robot or virtual someone in ar glasses or in the beginning just \"phone\" which will just show a video of that companion. There is absolutely no necessity in any interface other than video, well, which can also be in form of text and numbers structured into a spreadsheet.\n\nBut i think we'll forget how to write and read quite soon.

And there is a long road from this to acquiring the ability to ask the right questions.",

In this framework, \"knowing\" means prompting, maintaining means prompting, just like coding means prompting. It may be reasonable to dislike this outcome (I do) and reasonable also to adopt hiring practices that filter candidates with this skillset. But other companies will increasingly adopt this mode of development. We'll have to see if this eventually develops into a training/maintenance/creativity black hole, especially if you don't believe in AGI via LLM (I don't). But time is the real test.",

The main arguments are:\n\n*   **Ideas are the new bottleneck.** While Claude lowers the barrier to *coding*, it doesn't help you come up with a genuinely good, original idea. Many believe the market is already saturated with low-value AI-generated software, like yet another bookmark manager or to-do list app.\n*   **The SaaS market is in for a shake-up.** There's a big debate on whether this will kill Small-to-Medium SaaS. Some enterprise users are already replacing expensive subscriptions with in-house tools built with Claude. Others argue that most businesses lack the technical staff to build and maintain their own software and will stick with reliable, secure vendors.\n*   **New barriers are emerging.** Even if you have a great idea, you're still up against API fees, usage limits, and a predicted hardware shortage that could make high-quality AI prohibitively expensive for individuals.\n\nOh, and the thread completely derailed into a heated argument about whether n/0 is infinity or undefined. (Spoiler: it's undefined, and someone even brought proofs).",

We're now taking requests for what they should cancel next to fix the world.\n\nA few other key points from the trenches:\n*   **Google Sheets When?** A vocal minority is feeling left out and asking for a Google Sheets version. This has, predictably, kicked off the great Excel vs. Sheets holy war in the replies.\n*   **Proceed with Caution:** Some users are warning about hallucinations and running out of tokens on large datasets. The prevailing advice is to have Claude write the formulas for you, but *definitely* double-check its work before you let it touch your precious data.\n*   **No, it can't make macros directly,** but it will give you the VBA code to copy and paste yourself.",

There were so many times that I needed a program, an app, something to do something very important, to organize my work and be aware of the big picture (what happens, when, where, who does it, how he does it, how to automate the procedure in order to become an \"autopilot\" procedure for the personnel etc). It's been about 5 months that I am finally building those tools with the help of AI (Claude ofcourse) and my work has skyrocketed. Currently, there is nothing I don't know, or I don't have control of. I know what is happening, when, were, what needs to be done more, what needs to be done less, where we need more balance, what we have to do daily in order to be fully productive etc. I don't know when people like me won't be necessary because of this technology, but at the moment this technology can boost the productivity in a way like never before.

      "text": "I've been a heavy Opus user since the 4.5 release, and over the past week or two I feel like something has changed. Curious if others are experiencing this or if I'm just going crazy.\n\nWhat I'm noticing:\n\nMore generic/templated responses where it used to be more nuanced\n\nIncreased refusals on things it handled fine before (not talking about anything sketchy - just creative writing scenarios or edge cases)\n\nLess \"depth\" in technical explanations - feels more surface-level\n\nSometimes ignoring context from earlier in the conversation\n\nMy use cases:\n\nComplex coding projects (multi-file refactoring, architecture discussions)\n\nCreative writing and worldbuilding\n\nResearch synthesis from multiple sources\n\nWhat I've tried:\n\nClearing conversation and starting fresh\n\nAdjusting my prompts to be more specific\n\nUsing different temperature settings (via API)\n\nThe weird thing is some conversations are still excellent - vintage Opus quality. But it feels inconsistent now, like there's more variance session to session.\n\nQuestions:\n\nHas anyone else noticed this, or is it confirmation bias on my end?\n\nCould this be A/B testing or model updates they haven't announced?\n\nAny workarounds or prompting strategies that have helped?\n\nI'm not trying to bash Anthropic here - genuinely love Claude and it's still my daily driver. Just want to see if this is a \"me problem\" or if others are experiencing similar quality inconsistency.\n\nWould especially love to hear from API users if you're seeing the same patterns in your applications.",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 100 comments.**\n\nAlright, let's get into it. The consensus in this thread is a **resounding 'YES,' OP is not going crazy.** The vast majority of users, especially those using Claude for coding, agree that there has been a noticeable decline in quality over the last few weeks.\n\nThe main complaints are that Opus has become:\n*   **Forgetful:** Constantly forgetting context, previous instructions, or even what it did just moments ago.\n*   **Lazy & Generic:** Providing surface-level, templated answers and avoiding complex tasks it used to handle with ease.\n*   **Unreliable:** Ignoring instructions, hallucinating, and failing at simple tasks, all while burning through usage limits.\n\nSo, what's the deal? The comment section has a few popular theories:\n*   **The Cynical Take:** Anthropic is intentionally \"shittifying\" the model to save on massive compute costs. The ol' bait-and-switch to see how bad it can get before users cancel their subs.\n*   **The Pattern-Spotters:** This is a classic pre-release cycle. They degrade the current model to free up resources for training the next one (Sonnet 4.7? Opus 5.0?) and to make the new release look even more impressive by comparison.\n*   **The Overload Theory:** Demand is just through the roof, and the servers are struggling to keep up, leading to degraded performance for everyone.\n\nA few dissenters argue it's just confirmation bias and that these \"decline\" posts are a constant fixture on the sub. Others suggest the issue might be user-side, like having massive context windows that get compacted into mush. However, these voices are in the minority.\n\n**As for workarounds, users have suggested:**\n*   Downgrading your Claude Code version (v2.0.64 and v2.0.74 are getting some love).\n*   Starting fresh chats more often to avoid context degradation.\n*   Refactoring large files to keep the context load manageable.\n*   Checking a site like `aistupidlevel.info` before starting a session.",

I have experienced a couple of moments of unusual stupidity by the model in that time. It's too early to tell but I do hope it is only the brain rot of the users coming out and not that of the model.

But the past week it has started to become really shoddy and unreliable to the point where I question the point of not just writing the code manually again. Which is why before Opus was added I had vastly decreased my use of CC after experiencing the same problem with Sonnet.\n\nI had thought I was just assigning Sonnet tasks that were beyond its scope, and after seeing Opus excel at stuff where Sonnet failed, was thinking that was true. But now I'm having doubts definitely. It's very frustrating cos it only takes a short while to learn to rely on it as part if your workflow, then when it suddenly can't do what it previously was doing, you lose hours battling it and trying to get it to work instead of just immediately giving up and going back to writing everything yourself.",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 50 comments.**\n\nAlright folks, the consensus in this thread is a resounding **YES, this is infuriating.** Everyone agrees that Claude's sudden auto-compaction feature is a major pain point, often losing the most recent and relevant parts of a conversation.\n\nThe main frustrations are:\n\n*   **We want a token counter!** The top-voted comment is a desperate plea for a simple counter in the web UI to see how much context is left. This feature *does* exist in Claude Code, but not in the regular web chat, which is a huge source of frustration for many.\n*   **Give us control.** Users would much rather hit a hard context limit and be allowed to manually summarize or choose what to carry over to a new chat, similar to ChatGPT's rolling context or by using a `/compact` command with their own instructions.\n\nHowever, the community has come through with some workarounds and solutions:\n\n*   **Browser Extension:** For web users, there's an open-source browser extension that adds a usage/token counter: `https://github.com/lugia19/Claude-Usage-Extension`\n*   **The \"Edit Message\" Trick:** When you feel you're near the limit, go back and edit an earlier message. Ask Claude to provide a summary of the conversation up to that point. This can clear the subsequent context and give you a summary to continue with.\n*   **Checkpoint Summaries:** Proactively ask Claude for \"checkpoint summaries\" every few messages. This way, if compaction hits, you have a recent summary ready to paste into a new chat.\n*   **Power User Method:** For the technically inclined, some users manage context externally using a \"Tiered Memory System\" (TMS), where they manually control which files (hot, warm, critical) are fed into the context for each prompt, drastically reducing token usage.\n\n**PSA:** Don't bother asking Claude how much context it has left. It will confidently hallucinate an answer. Also, you can't disable auto-compaction in the main web chat, only in Claude Code.",

The move to persistent tasks makes multi-day projects and agentic workflows actually viable.\n\nHowever, don't get too excited just yet. Users quickly pointed out this is a **very minimal implementation**. The biggest complaint is that tasks are stored locally and aren't shareable via Git, which is a step back from community tools like `beads`. While some are happy to ditch `beads` (calling it a \"hot mess\"), they're still waiting for Anthropic to add better project and team collaboration features.\n\nThe general feeling is that Anthropic nailed the most critical problem (memory loss) and will likely add more functionality later. For now, it's a solid, much-needed foundation.",

The difference is subtle, but you have to keep in mind that you are the mind and agent is the executor. At some point agent's tasks and their descriptions become too granular, leave the semantic level and become overly technical, like which files need to be looked at to make the buttons round or something silly like that. Which is great for the agent to remember, but utterly useless for humans to read and reason about. You'll be interested in about 10% of the issues, the rest is just an improved TODO list for the agent.",

Then it asks me to verify at the end of implementation, and if I accept, it removes that todo and commits.  If I prefix it with PROMPT: it treats it like a normal prompt, else it discusses the todo with me.\n\nIt's a super simple thing and I find it incredibly useful.

          "text": "Been experimenting with Tasks for the last few days. Here's a pattern that's solving a real problem for me.\n\nWhen you run agents in parallel, they step on each other. Two agents both see migration 027 is the last one, both create 028. Or agent B creates a table that REFERENCES something agent A hasn't built yet.\n\nTasks with `blockedBy` solves the coordination, but you still need to know what blocks what. Maintaining that manually is tedious.\n\nI built a framework called Specflow (see github link below)  to make dependencies machine-readable. The idea: rewrite every GitHub issue to include executable contracts. e.g.  SQL with REFERENCES clauses, TypeScript interfaces, invariant references. The specs already contain the dependency information; you just have to make it parseable.\n\nThen an agent prompt (just a markdown file) reads every ticket, extracts the signals, builds a directed graph, topological sorts into waves. It's not magic lol, it's telling a subagent what to grep for and how to structure the output.\n\nLaunch wave 0 (no blockers) in parallel. When those complete, wave 1 is unblocked. The parent conversation tracks \"wave N done, launch wave N+1.\" If context gets compacted, the graph is rebuildable from the tickets.\n\n9 agents, 8 minutes, 6 migrations, zero conflicts.\n\nWhy I trust 9 parallel agents: three-layer enforcement underneath.\n\n* YAML contracts → Jest pattern tests → build fails on architectural violations\n* Gherkin scenarios → Playwright tests → broken user flows caught post-build\n* Drift happens. Something catches it before merge.\n\nThe `blockedBy` primitive is powerful. What you put in your tickets determines whether coordination is automatic or manual.\n\nWrote up the workflow and open-sourced the agent prompts here: [https://github.com/hulupeep/specflow](https://github.com/hulupeep/specflow)  Go to the agents folder and read [workflow.md](http://workflow.md) \n\nCurious if anyone's solving the parallel agent coordination problem differently.",

Here's what we learned.\n\n# The Problem\n\nEvery time Claude reads your codebase, you're paying for tokens. Most projects have:\n\n* READMEs, changelogs, archived docs (rarely needed)\n* Core patterns, config files (sometimes needed)\n* Active task files (always needed)\n\nClaude charges the same for all of it.\n\n# Our Solution: HOT/WARM/COLD Tiers\n\nWe created a simple file tiering system:\n\n* **HOT**: Active tasks, current work (3,647 tokens)\n* **WARM**: Patterns, glossary, recent docs (10,419 tokens)\n* **COLD**: Archives, old sprints, changelogs (52,768 tokens)\n\nClaude only loads HOT by default. WARM when needed. COLD almost never.\n\n# Real Results (Our Own Dogfooding)\n\nWe tested this on our own project (cortex-tms, 66,834 total tokens):\n\n**Without tiering**: 66,834 tokens/session **With tiering**: 3,647 tokens/session **Reduction**: 94.5%\n\n**Cost per session**:\n\n* Claude Sonnet 4.5: $0.01 (was $0.11)\n* GPT-4: $0.11 (was $1.20)\n\n[Full case study with methodology →](https://cortex-tms.org/blog/cortex-dogfooding-case-study/)\n\n# How It Works\n\n1. Tag files with tier markers:\n\n  <!-- @cortex-tms-tier HOT -->\n\n\n2. CLI validates tiers and shows token breakdown: cortex status --tokens\n\n3. Claude/Copilot only reads HOT files unless you reference others\n\nWhy This Matters\n\n* 10x cost reduction on API bills\n* Faster responses (less context = less processing)\n* Better quality (Claude sees current docs, not 6-month-old archives)\n* Lower carbon footprint (less GPU compute)\n\nWe've been dogfooding this for 3 months. The token counter proved we were actually saving money, not just guessing.\n\nOpen Source\n\nThe tool is MIT licensed: [https://github.com/cortex-tms/cortex-tms](https://github.com/cortex-tms/cortex-tms)\n\nGrowing organically (1,000+ downloads without any marketing). The approach seems to resonate with teams or solo developers tired of wasting tokens on stale docs.\n\nCurious if anyone else is tracking their AI API costs this closely? What strategies are you using?",

The thread is pretty split, but here's the vibe:\n\nOP's idea of a \"HOT/WARM/COLD\" file tiering system to manually shrink the context window is getting props for being a smart way to tackle those brutal API bills. Everyone agrees that feeding Claude less junk is a good thing.\n\nHowever, the community is giving some serious side-eye to that 94.5% savings claim. **The main consensus is that OP is only seeing such a huge reduction because their repo is bloated with \"COLD\" files (like old sprints and retros) that probably shouldn't be there anyway.** It's less of a genius hack and more of a \"we stopped feeding the AI irrelevant files we had lying around.\"\n\nThe other major feedback is that manual tagging is a chore. The thread's best ideas for improving this are:\n*   **Automate it!** The top-voted suggestion is to use `git history` to automatically figure out which files are \"hot.\"\n*   Ditch the inline tags for a central config file, like a `.json` map or `.gitattributes`.\n*   Some folks are already using alternative methods, like smart file naming or a full-on RAG setup for older documentation.\n\nSo, **the verdict: The core idea of selective context is solid, but the massive savings claim is questionable and the real win would be automating the whole process.**",

Think of it like a table of contents linking to a chapter's table of contents, linking to actual small bite documentation that explains what was done, a link to the adr behind it (which you should also make), and a link to the actual files containing that code.\n\nThen ask it to make a roadmap when you're ready for code review and changes.

Here is what the user corrected me on\". It keeps that file dates and I found it now links to it in documentation around the feature it was working on.\n\nKeys here are making sure ai knows it's form itself and not for a human. MDs are under 200 lines. And use rules in the project to make sure its always updating documents and always journaling.

Geoffrey Huntley (the creator of the loop) reached out and designated it as the official explainer.\n\n  \nIn short: Ralph Wiggum is an autonomous coding loop that lets your Claude work through an implementation plan in your codebase while you sleep.\n\n\n\nHere are the key takeaways:\n\n**Skip the plugin** \\- Do not use Anthropic's Ralph plugin, it degrades performance by keeping each loop in the same context window.\n\n**Exploration mode** \\- My favorite way to use Ralph. When I have remaining tokens in my max plan, I brain dump and converse for \\~10 minutes with Claude and set up Ralph the night before usage resets. Lets him test, explore, and/or build an idea I've had to put on the backburner.\n\n**True simplicity** \\- Ralph is literally just a bash while loop that calls Claude in headless mode until a stopping criteria is met. This simplicity gives us power users a broad ability to tailor autonomous loops to our own systems and ideas.\n\n**Fresh context** \\- Instead of letting context accumulate and degrade, Ralph treats each iteration as a fresh context window. The spec and implementation plan become the source of truth, not previous conversation history. This sidesteps context rot entirely.\n\n**Spec sizing** \\- Your specs and implementation plan need to leave enough room for implementation within each loop. If your spec is too bloated, you risk hitting the \"dumb zone\" during every single iteration.\n\n**Bidirectional planning** \\- Have you and Claude both ask each other questions until your specs and implementation plan are fully aligned. This surfaces implicit assumptions, which are typically the source of most bugs.\n\n**You own the spec** \\- Since we are treating the specs as the source of truth, it is our job to read every line and edit it ourselves. Without bulletproof specs that make sense to us, Ralph will go off the rails.\n\n  \nFull video link (for the full rundown on how Ralph actually works): [https://youtu.be/I7azCAgoUHc](https://youtu.be/I7azCAgoUHc)",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 50 comments.**\n\nAlright folks, the consensus in this thread is a big thumbs-up for OP's explainer, which even got the nod from the creator of the Ralph loop. If you're just dropping in, here's the deal.\n\n**The community overwhelmingly agrees with OP's breakdown.** The main takeaways are that the \"Ralph Wiggum\" loop is a powerful pattern for autonomous coding, but you have to use it right.\n\nThe thread is buzzing about a few key things:\n\n*   **The \"Dumb Zone\" is real.** This is the term of the day. The consensus, backed by OP, is that Claude's performance tanks after about **100k tokens** in the context window. Keep your loops and specs lean to avoid it. You can even add a context percentage counter to your statusline in Claude Code to monitor this.\n*   **How to avoid \"AI Slop\":** A major concern raised is how to stop Ralph from just writing easy, biased tests for itself. The solution is to be the human in the loop *before* the loop starts.\n    *   Define strict, unbiased validation criteria in your `spec.md` from the get-go.\n    *   As one user put it perfectly: **\"Tell it to test the requirements, not the implementation.\"**\n    *   Power users are also using separate, adversarial agents for testing and code review.\n*   **It's a pattern, not a plugin.** To be crystal clear: **Do NOT use the official Anthropic Ralph plugin.** OP and others confirm it degrades performance by keeping everything in one context window, defeating the whole purpose. The \"real\" Ralph is just a simple `bash while` loop you write yourself that calls Claude in headless mode, creating a fresh context for each iteration.\n*   **This is probably not for the $20/month Pro plan.** The token usage is high, so this is more for users on higher-tier plans. You might have better luck with cheaper models if you're on a budget.",

              "text": "You can have ralph update the spec if you want! I have run some loops with stuff like an external progress.txt file or updating the specs. There absolutely is a middle ground here where you can have ralph update to a 'tried this and it didn't work' type of file, especially if tests aren't passing and you have to rerun him on a task. I think my favorite thing about ralph loops is that you can customize the flow and what context goes in in a variety of ways according to what hitches you run into during use. This is why I highly highly suggest people start with the vanilla ralph loop (instead of just cloning a git plugin) and build on it themselves. It teaches model behavior and context engineering in an interesting and fun way.",

The progress.txt approach—having the loop leave residue that shapes future iterations—feels like where things get interesting.\nOne question: is there a difference between logging failures (\"tried this, didn't work\") versus something more like accumulated posture? Where the context doesn't just record what happened but shifts how the next iteration approaches the problem.\nLike, does the model behave differently when it's inheriting a history versus starting fresh? Not just avoiding repeated mistakes, but overall strategy.\nThe \"build it yourself\" point tracks. Hard to understand the dynamics without feeling them.",

It is a Node.js CLI that runs a durable agent loop with state, planning, and guardrails, and I am dogfooding it by using Loopy to evolve its own codebase.\n\nInput is either a short prompt or a full PRD file. Loopy generates a plan document, splits work into phases and tasks, and then iterates until completion.\n\nEach iteration does the following automatically:\nUpdates the plan and task checklist\nGenerates the next agent prompt\nRuns a CLI coding agent\nCaptures logs and execution state\nRuns tests\nCommits changes when tests pass\n\nThe loop is deterministic and traceable from prompt or PRD, to plan, to code, to tests, to commit.\n\nLoopy is agent agnostic. It works with any CLI coding agent that accepts stdin. I have tested it with Cursor Agent and Copilot. Copilot performs better for streaming output and permission handling, which matters for fully autonomous runs.\n\nWhy I built this:\nI wanted a concrete understanding of Ralph style autonomous iteration combined with spec driven development before using it on higher risk work.\nUsing Loopy on itself forces it to prove correctness on real changes, not demos.\nIt surfaces CLI UX issues, failure modes, and missing guardrails very quickly.\nIt enforces a tight feedback loop with durable state and minimal context loss.\n\nEarly results have been very solid.

If you are using Claude for coding (especially with agents like Claude Code), you might be overpaying for the API by a factor of 30+.\n\n**The TL;DR:**\n\n1. **Subscription vs. API:** In a typical \"agentic\" loop (where the model reads the same context over and over), the subscription is **up to 36x better value** than the API.\n   * **Why?** Because on the web interface (Claude.ai), **cache reads are 100% free**. In the API, you pay 10% of the input cost every time. For long chats, the API eats your budget in minutes, while the subscription keeps going.\n2. **The \"Max 20x\" Trap:** Anthropic markets the higher tier as \"20x more usage,\" but the analyst found that this only applies to the 5-hour session limits.\n   * In reality, the **weekly** limit for the 20x plan is only **2x higher** than the 5x plan.\n   * Basically, the 20x plan lets you go \"faster,\" but not \"longer\" over the course of a week.\n3. **The \"Max 5x\" is the Hero:** This plan ($100/mo) is the most optimized.\n   * It gives you a **6x** higher session limit than Pro (not 5x as advertised).\n   * It gives you an **8.3x** higher weekly limit than Pro.\n   * It over-delivers on its promises, while the 20x tier under-delivers relative to its name.\n4. **How they found this:** They used the Stern-Brocot tree (fractional math) to reverse-engineer the \"suspiciously precise\" usage percentages (like `0.16327272727272726`) back into the original internal credit numbers.\n\n**Conclusion:** If you're a heavy user or dev, the $100 \"Max 5x\" plan is currently the best deal in AI.\n\nSource with full math and credit-to-token formulas: [she-llac.com/claude-limits](http://she-llac.com/claude-limits)",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 100 comments.**\n\nAlright folks, the consensus in this thread is a big 'hell yeah' to OP's number-crunching, but with a few giant asterisks.\n\n**The community largely agrees: the $100/mo \"Max 5x\" plan is the undisputed king of value for heavy users.** The math checks out—free cache reads on the web UI make it wildly cheaper than the API for long, agentic sessions. Many users on the 5x plan confirm they rarely hit their limits even with all-day use.\n\nHowever, the \"Max 20x is a trap\" claim has some nuance. The weekly limit is only 2x the 5x plan (for 2x the price), but the *5-hour session limit* is a whopping 4x higher. The verdict? **Max 20x is for 'sprinters' who need massive burst capacity, while Max 5x is for 'marathoners' who need sustained usage.**\n\nNow for the big 'but' that everyone's screaming about: **Anthropic has zero transparency.** These are reverse-engineered limits that could change tomorrow without a word. Use this info to optimize now, but don't bet your business on it long-term.\n\nHere are the key practical takeaways from the discussion:\n\n*   **Using Claude Code in VS Code?** Stop burning API credits! The official extension lets you log in with your `claude.ai` subscription. Several users were mind-blown by this.\n*   **Privacy Check:** Remember the API and web UI have different Terms of Service. The API is generally safer for sensitive/proprietary code.\n*   **The Contrarian Take:** A popular opinion is that limits are actually a *good* thing. They force you to become a more disciplined and efficient prompter instead of getting lazy with sloppy, token-gobbling prompts.",

If someone needed it only for an hour a month, or in very high usage but infrequently, then it could be cheaper than alternative plans. But I think since adding Claude Code to the Teams plan, most orgs just give that out to rank and file and people can upgrade to Premium if needed. \n\nI think they really do have too many plans with way to many different styles, and should just start merging them into a pay-as-you-go with minimums that are higher offering cheaper token costs. The time windows and weekly limits feel constricting, but then paying for something you dont use feels wasteful. We have all the extremes with a complicated product breakdown that only a few of its users actually understand, we need a happy middle ground so new users and enterprise can just get the right thing from the start and pay the right price. \n\nAlso a separate management portal for the API has tripped up our org a few times.

              "text": "That’s a logical next step in the math. Here is the quick breakdown of how Team compares to the Individual Max plans:\n\n1. The Entry Barrier: Team plans require a minimum of 5 seats. So, while the per-user cost might look comparable ($30/mo per user), you're looking at a $150/mo minimum commitment right out of the gate.\n2. Usage Caps: Team plans generally offer higher usage limits than the standard 'Pro' ($20) plan (usually around 2x-5x depending on demand), but they don't necessarily scale as aggressively as the Max 20x tier for an individual.\n3. The 'Admin' Edge: The real value of the Team plan isn't just tokens; it’s central billing, SSO, and 'Projects' with shared knowledge bases. For a dev team, the ability to share a 'Context' (documentation, style guides, common libraries) across 5 people is a massive multiplier that Individual plans don't offer.\n\nVerdict: If you are a solo dev, Max 5x is still the king of ROI. But if you have 4+ colleagues, the Team plan is better - not just for the limits, but for the shared context and organizational control.",

Claude Max (especially with Projects and massive context) is designed for 'the next 500 lines of logic across 10 files.' When you feed Claude a 100k+ token repo map, it can spot bugs and architectural flaws that a lighter model simply doesn't have the 'memory' to catch.\n\nThe 'Limit' factor: > Even 'Unlimited' plans like Copilot have hidden throttling or fallback to smaller models once you hit a certain threshold. With Claude Max, you are essentially paying for 'Reserved High-Performance Capacity.'\n\nVerdict: If you're building a simple app, Copilot is plenty. If you're refactoring a legacy enterprise monolith or designing a complex system from scratch, the $100 for Claude Max isn't a cost - it's an investment in a 'Senior Partner' rather than a 'Junior Assistant'.",

Local logs are perfect for tracking specific sessions.\n\nPersonally, I’m mostly using Claude as an agent directly in VS Code, so having this macro-level understanding of plan limits is crucial for my daily workflow.\n\nThe reason I found this analysis so valuable is that it explains the **'why'** behind the economy of web-plans vs API. While local stats show you what you've *spent*, this breakdown shows you how to *save* by picking the right tier for heavy agentic use.\n\nBoth combined give you the full picture. Thanks for sharing the link!",

For tools that are hardcoded to use Anthropic’s API keys only, there’s no way around it - you’re paying the 'API tax.'\n\nThat’s actually why I’ve shifted my workflow towards tools (like certain VS Code agents) that allow for 'Browser/Web' providers or MCP (Model Context Protocol). It lets you leverage that subscription 'arbitrage' while still having the power of an agent.\n\nBut yeah, if you're locked into an API-only environment like Moltbot, this math just serves as a painful reminder of what we're paying for convenience!",
