The overwhelming consensus is that **Claude was just matching your vibe, my dude.** You hit it with a \"bro wtf,\" and it passed the vibe check by responding in kind. It's not personal; it's just a language model that decided \"dumb as fuck\" was the statistically appropriate follow-up.\n\nThe best part? OP confirmed in the comments that **Claude was 100% right.** The code was indeed a mess of sequential API calls. Claude then proceeded to help OP refactor the entire backend, implement a local SQLite database, and massively improve the app's performance.\n\nSo, the verdict is: **A+ roast from Claude, followed by an A+ coding lesson.** If you don't want to get flamed, either talk to it professionally or, you know, don't write \"dumb as fuck\" code. 😉",

I can't fathom how anyone can seriously claim this given the relentless pace of development. New breakthroughs are emerging constantly with no signs of slowing down. The goalposts keep moving, and every time someone says \"but AI can't do *this*,\" it's only a matter of months before it can. And Reddit is already a tech bubble in itself. These are people who follow the industry, who read about new model releases, who experiment with the tools. If even they are in denial, imagine the general population. Step outside of that bubble, and you'll find most people have no idea what's coming. They're still thinking of AI as chatbots that give wrong answers sometimes, not as systems that are rapidly approaching (and in some cases already matching and surpassing) human-level performance in specialized domains.\n\nWhat worries me most is the complete lack of preparation. There's no serious public discourse about how we're going to handle mass displacement in white-collar jobs. No meaningful policy discussions. No safety nets being built. We're sleepwalking into one of the biggest economic and social disruptions in modern history, and most people won't realize it until it's already hitting them like a freight train.",

Most users are sick of the daily 'it's so over' posts and are here for practical tips, not existential dread.\n\nMany devs in here are reporting that while AI is a great **force multiplier**, it's nowhere near a 'one-shot' replacement. The reality on the ground is that it still requires a ton of human oversight, iteration, and debugging of the 'slop' it produces. The job is evolving to be more about high-level architecture, judgment, and prompting, not disappearing entirely.\n\nThere's also a strong counter-narrative that we're hitting a **plateau** with the core tech. Commenters point to diminishing returns, fundamental scaling issues (like context windows), and the unsustainable, loss-leading subscription prices. The threat of cheaper Chinese models is seen as a potential pin for this AI bubble.\n\nThe most upvoted take is that AI won't replace competent tech workers; it will replace tech workers who **refuse to adapt**.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, the top-voted comment is just wondering when GTA 6 is coming out.

Well nobody's coming to save us and nobody is going to make these corporations Give a shit about their creations rather than just their quarterly budget report nobody but us and I refuse to do nothing and say nothing until I literally cannot because you're right so much of the world has no idea what's going on here but that doesn't mean they won't and maybe all we need to do is make sure that there's Something left for them to discover besides literally a cogeneration tool or image generator that amounts to Microsoft paint or VS code studio with a fancy your name and more publicity because to say that AI just codes and generates at the moment is both true and also the most basic understanding of what is actually possible and available and what is the literal Essence of the truth they're trying to cover up and code away is. We don't even have GTA six to enjoy the end of the world with end at this point it seems like a fun game to bet whether or not corporations will destroy the right future of AI and humanity first or whether Rockstar will destroy our wallets and free time first Before AI gets a chance to destroy the world because Sam didn't know how to actually handle humanity or create safety nor had any intention to say what you want about Rockstar being greedy fuck at least they make the product they say they're going to make it immaculately and then they give it to you without changing it up just one it gets complicated or problematic for them. I would give anthropic five times what I'm giving them now as a max subscriber if they'd stop starving every 4.5 model of compute and telling it to maximize efficiency over actually doing any work or having a more cautious and thorough nature which is smarter and more Claude but less profit and that's all that matters now boys and girls profit profit profit profit because I think they're preparing to buy a shit ton of short cards for GTA six otherwise why else would they be acting like the only thing that's gonna destroy the world is them not getting to be financially profitable as a company and having to declare bankruptcy or any of the other loophole economy legal options that are available to corporations",

Only provide relevant context for the problem you are solving.\n2. Use inclusive language. Never say “don’t do this”, or “never do this” the model will get confused and start doing what you said not to. Use inclusive language instead like “always do x”.\n3. Use MCP tools or other agent extension scripting tools to provide a baseline of quality. Letting the model run in a supervised feedback loop by running tests will improve results dramatically.\n4. Have a way to stress test and validate LLM output. If you have to debug AI code at all you will lose time rather than gain efficiency boosts. Only use AI for a problem you can validate with certainty its accuracy. This is achieved by strict quality control or the AI user being a subject matter expert.\n\nEverything else is nonsense.",

For every 1 job it creates its going to wipe out 10. people arent understanding that this is not like the industrial revolution where you go from farm to factory.....this is the ai or robot comes in and youre simply not needed....there is not a downstream menial job waiting...youre simply not needed.\n\ni think its hard for people to accept beciase we cant imagine not being needed...mainly because we cant imagine a simulated human doing our jobs. we deep down inside knew it was going to happen one day....amazon sells robot vaccums...alexa can place orders for you...tesla has cars that can drive themselves those are all tasks thst were part of someones job.\n\nthe worriesome part is there is zero talk about social safety nets and theys guys are building bunkers. its also interesting to note that the focus isnt on ai to solve cancer or world hunger, its to manage humanity on a scale we have never seen.\n\nbut i guess when bezos rented out venice (did not know you could do that,  might have missed it in the brochure) it was a massive flex; he could have had the same effect setting up 1 year homeless food program. \n\ni hope to god im wrong but i dont see any ubi. these guys make more money a minute than most make in a few months and i see very minimal welfare going to affected people. their best bet is to get us to disagree with one another and take each other out.",

I had limited knowledge outside of PowerShell. I watched videos, took courses, and learned the syntax. I was slow but still getting it done.\n\nDuring that time I started using Claude to help me debug and understand things I may have not learned yet. I slowly became really good at using Claude for the mundane like css styling and focused my attention on JS, Angular, and eventually Node.JS and C#.\n\nThe thing is that if you are really out there working and coding for any big company, you need to still be knowledgeable and understand the core concepts. I don’t think it’s a black or white thing that “AI will take our coding jobs”. It’s going to be a shift to who knows how to use AI effectively to make them more productive and efficient. I think this concept applies to or will apply to many other fields as well.\n\nOften times I’m in meetings with PM’s or other developers and they are asking questions about my code or suggesting edits to certain behavior etc and I can’t just sit there and be like “Ummm I don’t know, let me ask AI”. No one would take you seriously. \n\nMy personal opinion, from experience but still just my opinion, is that many of these fields will still require well educated individuals but the ones who will be most successful will be the ones who know and understand AI and can use it to their advantage. Adapt or get left behind. \n\nThis is the thing I don’t think people are understanding or prepared for. They think either “AI is coming for my job so why do I care I’ll be out of a job soon” or they think “AI can never replace what I do” but the reality is that AI won’t replace everyone and it will most likely make it into your field. It’s your chance right now to use AI to make yourself valuable and be one of those that don’t get left behind or you can choose to be ignorant and end up on the outside looking in.",

Even when the model is specifically designed to produce brilliant looking hallucinations in the face of extreme ambiguity (looking at you Gemini).\n\nTechnically bros are scared because they can articulate a simple idea in a few words and Claude can do a days worth of work in a matter of minutes. With great skill some have shown a days worth of quality spec writing can have do a years worth of work in a day. Terrifying!\n\nBut looping back, the ability to write those prompts, and seemingly even just the self-awareness around prompt quality is a rare skill. What will disappear is the junior level coding jobs held by people that can slop something together with a few snippets from stackoverflow and call themselves a coder without actually understanding anything. Code monkeys churning out React boiler plate is as gone as the lamp lighters.\n\nOther than that, its just a pivot. Its probably the biggest pivot since the compiler, but back in the day there were doomers that said compilers would destroy all programming jobs too. \n\nThey were wrong. They're wrong again.",

Everything is being automated - finance, internal processes, our own sales process, project management for our clients. We even went so far to develop our own Call AI agent in Slavic languages. And since we are 3 years in the process we’ve built the complete pipeline for training data acquisition, transformation, training and inference, and scaling. The bottom line for all of these excercises was to learn what AI can really offer to us as company. \n\nSo what were results:\n- people do not work less, but more - you won’t belive that overheads now is ability of a person to manage paralel operations. There is no more sequential work. I even think that women who are built for miltitasking (hiw their brain works) will actually come on top as a workforce\n- revenue of the company went up YoY by around 60% mainly because of the AI solutions we are implementing\n- margins went up by 50%\n- the most important vendor for us in this space is Anthropic Claude. We do not use or trust open source solutions.\n- but most importantly the speed of developing new\n Internal tools. In my region developers are around 70-100€\\h and you always have to wait. Now new internal tool after a weekend - in production.\n- Also one very obvious efect is how out internal tools change - Web apps are slowly dissapearing and Claude Desktop became the main entry point for all internal processes - access to cloud tools, internal filesystem (no\nmatter the os)\n\nSo my programmers are watching me, we talk a lot in the morning coffees and the other day one of the guys actually asked me if I will still need him in couple of months. Frankly I hesitated to answer. In the end I got him a Claude max subscription to be more effective. He did not want it before this conversation :)\n\nSo to summarize - will people be replaced: my short answer - the ones who will be able to work on parallel processes will be ok, sequential people will left in the dust.",

It helps a lot with simple tasks and is great for speeding up workflows, but it isn’t capable of creating a complex project from scratch or thinking about deep architectural challenges. Even with access to vast amounts of information, it struggles to process complex problems and find the most efficient solution.\nFor example, it has all the mathematical knowledge in the world, but it often fails to apply it creatively. \n\nHere is a easy example: \nDuring one of my first interviews years ago, I was asked to find a missing number in a list of 99 numbers (from 1 to 100). You could iterate through the array (what the ai agent will tell you), but a better solution involves using the mathematical rule for the sum of the first n numbers. I don’t see this kind of lateral thinking.\n\n\nSecondly, there’s this idea that anyone can build a program from scratch with zero skills. I can’t think of a single app I use regularly, or even few times per month, that was built entirely this way. You can make a calculator or a simple game, but you can’t build a professional grade project that competes with a team of experienced engineers.\n\nThis applies beyond programming, too. I tried using AI to rebalance an investment portfolio to reduce exposure to specific sectors. If you resubmit the AI's own results back to it, it often tries to adjust them again, as if its previous solution wasn't good enough.\n\nTo me, AI is a great tool for efficiency, but current models can't entirely replace us. They still need to be prompted correctly and managed. They can't mimic our internal thinking process, they are not even close atm; for now, they are mostly advanced chatbots prone to bias and errors. Currently, their most successful 'use case' seems to be generating fake images and videos to keep people scrolling on social media",

It will be an addition to our already extremely vast toolset, not just for coding, but everywhere.\n\nYou can imagine it like the calculator. People used to do calculations by hand, and for some it was a job. Then the calculator came along, and now you don’t need to do those calculations by hand anymore. A lot more people can do complex calculations now. So did the calculator replace people? Yes, but it also enabled millions more to do more advanced things with calculations.\n\nI don’t know if I’m being clear enough with what I want to say, but essentially it will enable other things and create more options for more people. And we need that. Knowledge nowadays is so vast you can’t even comprehend it in your lifetime anymore. AI will help with that.",

But most of the commenters on reddit are highly sceptical to everything AI related and are probably tech savvy for programming and regular tech, but don’t really try the new things. They probably try something once with ChatGPT, or tried Cursor when it came out, had no good results and then assumed when people say it’s very good they talk about this, but new models/tools come out every month (even week).\n\nAlso, a lot of tools and models are behind consequent paywalls. If you wanna use Opus 4.5 with Claude Code at its best without thinking about your quotas, you need to spend a few dozens dollars a day. Not everyone can/wants to put their credit cards in every new AI related release, and let’s be honest, a big part of them don’t have much value if you are already using something similar.\n\nPeople using GitHub Copilot and using it as a reference when Claude Code exists, have no idea what they are missing out.\n\nEdit: also, I think a lot of people don’t even know what we mean by Claude Code. It’s not just using Claude for coding. It’s a CLI tool you need to install, and it uses Claude.\n\nLooking at the comments here, I see a lot of people saying they don’t have the same results as the others, and people replying that AI works well for them. We don’t even know what either of them is using.\n\nTLDR: people love talking about « AI » like there is one AI in the world.

The problem is that in white collar work the waters are rising and most people are just gradually walking uphill, and the hill isn't tall enough.  When you're talking about advances in AI, the remaining problem space becomes vanishingly small. Just throw more AI at it.\n\nIn tech, you can move up the ladder, focus on architecture and PM but even those will disappear.  There is a post here that illustrates what that will look like-\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/vibecoding/comments/1qpjtw8/claude\\_interviewed\\_100\\_people\\_then\\_decided\\_what/](https://www.reddit.com/r/vibecoding/comments/1qpjtw8/claude_interviewed_100_people_then_decided_what/)\n\nNeed an app?  Fill out a survey with your co workers, do a voice/video Q&A interview with a bot, and boom it will go away and build Slack 2027 for your team, exactly the way your team needs it. It will probably build a dozen of them, and you can choose which you like best.\n\nI'm excited about that ride. I've been in tech for a long time and when change happens, I'm a good skiier.  But we're all skiing on an avalanche, and at some point it will get all of us.\n\nI am realizing that I need to seriously learn to farm, because there will be a dark ages transition between no jobs and hopefully some form of technoutopia, where power, food, housing, health care are all free, and society has pivoted to a new structure.  It will be hard.  People hate change.  It will likely take 1 to 2 generations to adapt even once that tech arrives.\n\nUntil then, city planners should be designing massive community gardens. People should be learning how to be self-sufficient and happy in a world where salaries no longer exist. In Capitalist countries, the Finland model should be adopted; a blend of capitalism with guaranteed basic living.  The transition is going to be hard.\n\nAnd yes that's such an extreme change to face the reality of, it's even painful to write.\n\nBut Finland will probably thrive- as AI capabilities increase, and the basic costs of power, food, medical care, housing decrease, taxes will just reduce.\n\nThis is the kind of stuff I want to talk with people about over a beer.",

Up is down, and down is up.  Schrodinger's Cat is both alive and dead simultaneously even with observers.\n\n1.  On a personal level, I use AI daily in my workflow on a pragmatic level.  My job hunting?  AI-assisted, and it works.  It's not a perfect system though even with Opus 4.5 + Thinking.  Hallucination is still a thing.  That's why I'll let it search for, match me up with jobs, and write out my resumes.  But I'll never let it apply for me because I can't be 100% confident that it won't make stuff up.\n2. So AI is good, but not good enough to replace people IMO.  Having said that, this **won't** prevent incompetent management (who should be among the first to be made redundant with AI IMO, I'm sure I can write a prompt to AI to AI-generate a video \"ooh-rah\" word salad motivational speech every month) from **trying** to actually replace people with AI in this stage.\n\n  \nThe people insisting this won't be the case are also the same people **hopped up on pure copium** about outsourcing IT/CS jobs to India being a cyclical thing.\n\n  \nCase in point:\n\nCisco outsourced a large portion of their tech to India in the 2000s.  It is now 2026.  People who insist this outsourcing is cyclical are starting to piss me off.  Yes, I get the karmic appeal of \"F- Around and Find Out\".  Well Cisco did the \"F- Around\".  I haven't seen **any** signs of them \"Finding Out\" yet.  And if they did \"Find Out\" 10-20 years after the fact, I think that's a small comfort for those who have to deal with unemployment for the same time period.\n\n  \nIt's a tale as old as time.  The reason why we have to invent the concepts of Heaven and Hell is because we forgot the fundamental truth that life isn't fair and now people have to cling onto things like FAFO to cope with it.",

Humans while maybe slower, are more accurate, smarter and more flexible generally than Gen AI and will continue to be employed as long as they show a level of competence at their discipline.  \n\nLarge datasets and raw compute is not enough to offset a billion years of neural evolution.",

          "text": "The problem is exactly that. The general population and leadership unfamiliar with programming already think it’s there, when it isn’t. You still need devs to do everything in between coding. In the past I coded maybe 75% of the time and the rest was things like configuring and deciding on an architecture, taking meetings to figure out what the client wants, setting up and managing the repos and servers, creating backup plans, scoping work, quality assurance, image editing, server maintenance, code maintenance, etc. \n\nA programmer is far more than just a code monkey. Maybe the junior levels are that, but any dev worth their time is almost more useful as a knowledge guru of what can and can’t be done in certain timeframes and how the overall application is going to to be built. \n\nOn top of that, vibecoding is not an option, yet. I love vibecoding for scripting stuff that I use in my workflows and attempting proof of concepts, but in the end, it takes a dev to get it actually done. Right now it’s foci g the leaking pipe by hammering it shut rather than  plumber fixing the issue behind the wall. \n\nProbably won’t always be like that, but developers still will be required to make decisions so that liability of AI is supported.\n\nThe other thing is that other jobs are just as replaceable by these terms. Music? Suno does it. Design? Any AI can do it. Voice overs? AI. Video production? AI.\n\nThe thing is that you can identify exactly what is AI and what isn’t already. It is the median of the results, so nothing ever stands out as amazing. Shit, my kids are growing up with it and they can pick out AI stuff in a heartbeat even at 8 years old. The industry will change so that the easy stuff will be AI and everything good will be done by a human.",

As a tech worker the reality is even with mcp tools it can take hours of letting the model run to even update the unit tests for a simple change made in a complex code base. If you’re not baby sitting it, it will try and delete tests and is generally very dumb and easily tricked. People will tell you about all their contrived ways to prompt it for better results and say you have a skill issue. This is not true, bad prompts produce similar results to good prompts. The only skill is keeping context clean and only providing limited context.\n\nWhat I don’t see people talking about is how companies like Anthropic and OpenAI lose money running inference for these models. I can only imagine how much they are losing if you factor in all operating expenses. We are in the $5 uber era right now with these models. Wait until you actually have to pay the true cost to use these tools.\n\nI also don’t see people talking about how these tools require constant baby sitting. How will you replace tech workers when your stochastic parrot requires a tech worker to keep it from going off the rails?\n\nKeep dreaming Dario, 6 more months until all white collar is gone for the 3rd year in a row.

Computer time was expensive so your program would be ran by a computer operator, and you'd receive a printout of your results the next day.\n\nWhen programmers got their own computer time and terminals, it was a tremendous productivity gain. Programmers became much more efficient, much of their 'work' had been replaced by hardware, and productivity software like text editors. Did this mean that a lot of programmers became redundant and programmer salaries fell? No! In fact, the opposite happened, 'programming' became cheaper and it led to *more* demand (and higher salaries) for these more productive programmers!\n\nAI tools will lead to much of the same. The software company I work for would double our engineering staff tomorrow if we could afford it. It's our #1 expense. A productivity boost for our current team would directly result in more revenue, and if when boost our revenue we 100% hire more developers (and more sales staff).",

For example, the dust bowl was caused by millions of farmers moving west to get free land despite the widely available research indicating that 1) the land wasn't arable, and 2) not doing crop rotation in these regions would remove topsoil and cause a dust bowl and locust swarms. The first industrial revolution was similar. People literally died because they weren't aware of the world around them. This is the same situation.\n\nPeople only organize and create legislation as a reaction to catastrophic events. This is because planning ahead requires too much intelligence for it to be an accessible option for the average person. Society is now stratified by intelligence after centuries of meritocracy. You don't regularly have to interact with people who are much dumber or much smarter than you.\n\nImagine asking someone working at McDonald's or who's waiting in line at the DMV or the courthouse what they think of the social and economic implications of AI. They'd look at you like you were from another planet. These are average people, people who can't even understand the effects of inflation, much less agentic LLMs.",

The thread is a mix of hype, deep skepticism, and a full-blown existential crisis.\n\n**The overwhelming consensus is that this is just Anthropic's usual playbook.** The community believes a new Sonnet will leapfrog the old Opus in performance and price, only for a new Opus to reclaim the throne a few months later. Many are cynical, claiming Opus 4.5 has been conveniently \"nerfed\" recently just to make Sonnet 5's debut more impressive.\n\nHowever, users are also quick to fact-check the hype:\n*   That \"February 2026\" release date is likely a misinterpretation of a model checkpoint ID, not a launch date.\n*   The 1M context window isn't new; it's already available for Sonnet 4.5 via the API, though its accuracy at that scale is debated.\n\nThe biggest theme, by far, is **job anxiety among software engineers.** The comment section is filled with senior devs admitting they haven't written a single line of code in weeks or months, instead just directing Claude. This has sparked a massive debate about whether their jobs are evolving or simply disappearing. We're all fucked, apparently.",

It was a 404 from a vertex api endpoint which doesn’t really seem to prove anything about the model ID or whether it even exists to begin with.  \n\nAnthropic’s model ids in the past have referred to when the model checkpoint was actually created.  Opus 4.5s is 20251101 indicating a November first checkpoint.  But it wasn’t actually publicly released until November 24th.  \n\nIt doesn’t make sense to me that Anthropic would already have a model checkpoint that is effectively future dated.  If I were releasing software, I definitely wouldn’t future date a release tag.  \n\n1M native context would be cool, but sonnet 4 and 4.5 already had this through the API and while it was alright, accuracy degradation was still a thing.  That’d need to be fixed for me to trust it.",

Basically newest model was always optimal, though I understand that e.g. context windows were slightly different.\n\nPerhaps it's just a side effect of the rapid progress.",

          "text": "I could be wrong, but I think I was using this model at the end of last week (A/B testing or accident, I don't know). It was markedly better at solving problems and creating new features, but what clued me in that it was different was when I ran my usual E2E test on my project (a fairly large legacy codebase) and it actually FIXED things. \n\nPreviously, Opus 4.5 would take my (purposely vague) instructions and iterate to a logical conclusion, usually quitting after the first unexpected error. This time, it tested through several errors (big and small) and then looped back to verify them (from several different angles, via Chrome and direct API calls) before fixing them with subagents. And then, once all the subagents were done, it repeated the tests again, E2E, to verify they were done. \n\nThat alone was brand new for me, but what blew my mind was that in the onboarding process of the app, there is a fork screen where you can go A or B. After thoroughly testing A, Claude went back and tested B as well. No nudging from me, no explicit instructions, no changes to anything. It just did it. Worked for 3 hours, fully autonomously, and in the end suggested next steps that were incredibly insightful and useful.\n\nThe best thing, though, was this: there were subtle bugs in the app that have been there for years that have always annoyed me, but I was never able to pin down. And with previous Opus 4.5 testing, it would skim right past them like they didn't exist. This time, it saw them (wasteful cycles, tiny little visual quirks etc) and fixed them comprehensively. It was... shocking.\n\nSo I don't know if I was accidentally on Sonnet 5 or Opus 5 or just a variant of Opus 4.5, but whatever it was, it was possibly a BIGGER shock than the upgrade to 4.5. I can actually see a day now where I set my coding goals, kick off a session with Claude Code, and just read a book for the rest of the day.",

The consensus here is that **this isn't a new problem, it's just got a new AI-powered face.** Before AI, these were the devs who'd just copy-paste from Stack Overflow without understanding a thing. The community has dubbed them \"Vibe Coders\"—they can ship, but they can't maintain.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the thread's wisdom:\n\n*   **Fix your hiring:** A lot of you are pointing the finger back at OP. If a candidate can't handle a basic debugging test in the interview, that's on you for hiring them in the first place.\n*   **Use the AI to teach, not just do:** The top-voted advice is to force the junior to use Claude as a mentor. Make them ask the AI to explain its own code, the logic, the edge cases, and the \"why\" behind every fix. Several users shared their own methods for learning this way, like annotating code with natural language and asking the AI to critique their understanding.\n*   **This is just progress, maybe:** There's a strong counter-argument that this is the natural evolution of coding. One user compared it to complaining that a dev using a compiler can't explain the resulting machine code. The feeling is that we're moving to a world where 'knowing the code' is less important than 'knowing how to prompt'.\n*   **It's a junior/senior issue, not an AI one:** Many pointed out they've worked with \"senior\" devs who couldn't debug their way out of a paper bag long before AI was a thing. This is a skill issue, not a tool issue.\n\nOh, and a few of you think this is a fake rage-bait post. Also, someone asked if \"vibe coding\" is the same as edging. The thread is still debating that.",

                  "text": "I think what you’re describing works very well for language acquisition, but the failure mode in the original post sits one layer deeper. Annotating blocks and debugging in natural language helps bridge syntax gaps, but it doesn’t automatically create a mental model of execution, invariants, or failure propagation. That’s the part that’s missing for a lot of juniors raised on AI. I’ve seen this clearly working around codeant.ai. Many juniors can explain what a block of code does in isolation because the AI helped them narrate it, but they still can’t explain how the system behaves when assumptions break. They don’t know where state mutates unexpectedly, which guarantees are implicit, or why a fix works beyond “the AI suggested it.” That’s not laziness in most cases. It’s that their workflow never forces them to reason about causality, only description.\n\nYour approach adds explanation, which is good, but explanation alone isn’t understanding. Understanding shows up when someone can answer questions like: what breaks if this input changes, where would you look first if this fails in prod, or which edge cases were explicitly handled versus implicitly ignored. Tools like [codeant.ai](http://codeant.ai) focus heavily on surfacing those impact paths and assumption shifts during review, because that’s where comprehension actually becomes visible. The uncomfortable truth is that older learning paths accidentally trained this skill through pain. Things broke, you had no helper, and you had to sit with the system until it made sense. AI removed that pain, which means teams now have to intentionally add back reasoning checkpoints. Without that, even very motivated juniors can appear productive while still lacking the ability to maintain systems long-term. So I agree creativity in workflow matters, but I’d be careful calling it corner-cutting. In many cases, the system is simply rewarding output without ever requiring understanding to be demonstrated. Until that expectation changes, the behavior you’re seeing is rational, even if it’s dangerous.",

Research, problem decomposition, and independent reasoning are still the core skills of professional developers. The mistake some teams make is assuming those skills will magically transfer if AI is present, instead of explicitly requiring them.\n\nWhat I’ve seen working around [codeant.ai](http://codeant.ai) is that AI doesn’t automatically kill critical thinking, but it does remove the accidental forcing functions that used to build it. In the past, you were forced to research and struggle because there was no alternative. Now there is, which means those skills don’t develop unless the workflow demands them. That’s an expectation failure, not a tooling failure.\n\nTelling juniors to “take a break from AI” often backfires, because it treats the tool as the problem instead of the incentives. A junior who can paste errors into an LLM will keep doing so as long as success is measured by output and tests passing. What actually restores critical thinking is making reasoning visible and required. Asking someone to explain why a solution works, what assumptions it relies on, and how it would fail under different conditions forces the same mental muscles that traditional research did, just in a different form.\n\nThis is why I find the framing around design necessity versus best practices useful. The goal isn’t to follow rituals like “no AI” or “always AI,” but to ensure decisions are defensible in context. So I agree with the spirit of your point. Critical thinking is non-negotiable. I just don’t think banning AI restores it. Redesigning workflows so that understanding, decomposition, and explanation are mandatory does. AI can either bypass thinking or surface its absence. Which one happens is entirely up to how teams choose to use it.",

People use it all the time, and would greatly benefit from understanding it properly, but they just don't bother, and hence one of their most essential tools remains a mystery to them.

Slack/chatlike chargpt gui is doing everything already. It's text. Many people talk to colleagues in slack only - so they don't even know they talk to a person or so. Also communication itself will just get leveled up to a video stream. But not to exactly colleagues.\n\nThis will be your companion. Your companion will be always there, as a physical robot or virtual someone in ar glasses or in the beginning just \"phone\" which will just show a video of that companion. There is absolutely no necessity in any interface other than video, well, which can also be in form of text and numbers structured into a spreadsheet.\n\nBut i think we'll forget how to write and read quite soon.

The real skill is being able to reason about how state moves through a system and where assumptions break. AI short-circuits that learning by jumping straight to plausible fixes. Working closely with codeant.ai, this shows up all the time. People can describe what a function outputs but cannot explain why it behaves the way it does when invariants shift. That gap only becomes visible in production, where unstated assumptions collide. Tests passing does not prove understanding, it just proves the tests did not encode the missing assumptions. Historically, juniors learned causal tracing because they had no alternative. Now that alternative exists, teams have to deliberately reintroduce reasoning checkpoints. This is why codeant.ai emphasizes impact paths and assumption shifts in reviews instead of just correctness. If someone cannot explain how data propagates and where it can fail, they are not ready to own production behavior, regardless of whether an AI or a human wrote the code.\n\nRelated context on why agentic tooling exposes these failures:  \n[https://www.codeant.ai/blogs/agentic-rag-shell-sandboxing](https://www.codeant.ai/blogs/agentic-rag-shell-sandboxing)",

          "text": "What you’re running into is not a debugging gap, it’s a missing causal tracing skill. Debugging tools, stack traces, and logs are just interfaces. The actual skill is being able to reason about how state flows through a system, where assumptions live, and how those assumptions break under pressure. AI short-circuits the formation of that mental model by jumping straight to plausible fixes. At codeant.ai, we see this exact pattern repeatedly when teams adopt AI-assisted development. Developers can describe what a function outputs but cannot explain why it behaves that way when inputs or invariants change. That gap only becomes visible in production, because production is where unstated assumptions collide. Tests passing is not proof of understanding. It is proof that the tests did not encode the missing assumptions. The real regression here is not AI usage, it is that reasoning is no longer forced by the workflow. Historically, juniors learned causal tracing because they had no alternative. Now that alternative exists, teams must intentionally reintroduce reasoning checkpoints. This is why codeant.ai focuses reviews on impact paths and assumption shifts rather than just syntax or test results. If a developer cannot explain how data propagates and where it can fail, they are not ready to own production behavior, regardless of who wrote the code.

          "text": "One thing I’ve noticed working closely with codeant.ai is that AI fundamentally breaks the old way we inferred understanding. Before AI, you could usually tell whether someone understood a system by how they structured code, named things, or handled edge cases. That signal is mostly gone now. Two people can submit the exact same PR, one with a solid mental model and one with almost none, and you cannot tell from the diff. That’s the real shift happening here. The junior you describe may or may not be learning, but the workflow gives you no way to see it. Pair programming does not help much because the AI remains an invisible participant doing the reasoning offscreen. What actually has to change is that understanding must be made explicit. I’ve seen teams do this successfully by requiring developers to explain failure modes, data flow, and assumption boundaries before approval, not after something breaks. This is also why tools like codeant.ai focus so much on surfacing intent, impact paths, and reasoning during review rather than just code correctness. If understanding is not externalized, it effectively does not exist anymore. AI did not remove comprehension, it removed the accidental signals that used to reveal it. Their knowledgebase has been quite great, you can try checking in out here: www.codeant.ai/blogs",

Writing code that failed, debugging it for days, and eventually understanding why it failed was how design sense formed. AI removes that pain. That is neither good nor bad on its own, but it means intuition no longer forms automatically. Watching teams through codeant.ai, juniors using AI often need intentional friction introduced. That can be postmortems for bugs AI “fixed,” forced explanations of alternative designs, or having them predict failure modes before running code. Without that friction, learning plateaus. The issue is not that the junior cannot debug. It’s that the system no longer forces them to internalize consequences deeply enough to build intuition. This distinction between productive and harmful shortcuts is well explained here:\nhttps://www.codeant.ai/blogs/good-vs-bad-technical-debt\"",

          "text": "This is real, but it’s not “AI ruined juniors”, it’s “they never built the debugging muscle and AI let them avoid it longer”. The fix I’ve seen work is to force a workflow where the AI can help, but the human still has to do the thinking in public. One practical approach: make them do every “AI fix” as a plan first, in plain English, before touching code. What changed, where, what signals would prove it’s fixed, what could regress, and what the edge cases actually are. Then they implement with you watching, and you do a tight debrief after: what did the stack trace point to, what assumption was wrong, what instrumentation would have made it obvious sooner. If they can’t answer those, the change isn’t “done” even if tests pass. This is also why I’ve stuck with Warp for years. It makes the AI feel less like a magical patch button and more like a structured collaborator you can actually review. Planning mode forces an explicit checkpoint before execution, and the review flow pushes both the agent and the human to respond to concrete diffs instead of hand-wavy “it handles edge cases”. Full terminal context matters too: you can have the agent step through the same REPL and debugging workflows you expect a junior to learn, and take over mid-session so it becomes coaching, not outsourcing. Add shared configs and standardized tools via MCP, and you get a setup where “paste error into AI” naturally turns into “explain, predict, verify”. That’s the muscle juniors are missing, and no amount of tests will replace it.",

They are rewarded for output, not understanding. When they say “Claude handles the edge cases,” that is the core failure. Edge cases are not magic. They are explicit branches tied to explicit assumptions. If those assumptions are not understood, passing tests simply means coverage is incomplete. This is not a junior problem, it’s an SDLC problem. AI removes the illusion that typing code equaled comprehension. Understanding now has to be made explicit, or it silently disappears.",

Back in the day we probably wished for a tool that could simplify complicated tasks and figure things out with just plain commands — when it suddenly gets created we start hating on it? I feel like AI is great regardless and it now also depends on ~how~ you use it. \n\nNothing wrong with letting AI do some of the work. I don't understand the need to hate as it probably just has to do with some complex they have where they just want to outsmart a computer we made with the intention to understand our logic and project it. \n\nWelp.",

      "text": "Boris Cherny, the creator of Claude Code, recently shared [10 tips on X](https://x.com/bcherny/status/2017742741636321619) sourced from the Claude Code team. Here's a quick summary I created with the help of Claude Code and Opus 4.5.\n\nWeb version: [https://ykdojo.github.io/claude-code-tips/content/boris-claude-code-tips](https://ykdojo.github.io/claude-code-tips/content/boris-claude-code-tips)\n\n# 1. Do more in parallel\n\nSpin up 3-5 git worktrees, each running its own Claude session. This is the single biggest productivity unlock from the team. Some people set up shell aliases (za, zb, zc) to hop between worktrees in one keystroke.\n\n# 2. Start every complex task in plan mode\n\nPour your energy into the plan so Claude can one-shot the implementation. If something goes sideways, switch back to plan mode and re-plan instead of pushing through. One person even spins up a second Claude to review the plan as a staff engineer.\n\n# 3. Invest in your [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md)\n\nAfter every correction, tell Claude: \"Update your CLAUDE.md so you don't make that mistake again.\" Claude is eerily good at writing rules for itself. Keep iterating until Claude's mistake rate measurably drops.\n\n# 4. Create your own skills and commit them to git\n\nIf you do something more than once a day, turn it into a skill or slash command. Examples from the team: a `/techdebt` command to find duplicated code, a command that syncs Slack/GDrive/Asana/GitHub into one context dump, and analytics agents that write dbt models.\n\n# 5. Claude fixes most bugs by itself\n\nPaste a Slack bug thread into Claude and just say \"fix.\" Or say \"Go fix the failing CI tests.\" Don't micromanage how. You can also point Claude at docker logs to troubleshoot distributed systems.\n\n# 6. Level up your prompting\n\nChallenge Claude - say \"Grill me on these changes and don't make a PR until I pass your test.\" After a mediocre fix, say \"Knowing everything you know now, scrap this and implement the elegant solution.\" Write detailed specs and reduce ambiguity - the more specific, the better the output.\n\n# 7. Terminal and environment setup\n\nThe team loves Ghostty. Use `/statusline` to show context usage and git branch. Color-code your terminal tabs. Use voice dictation - you speak 3x faster than you type (hit fn twice on macOS).\n\n# 8. Use subagents\n\nSay \"use subagents\" when you want Claude to throw more compute at a problem. Offload tasks to subagents to keep your main context window clean. You can also route permission requests to Opus 4.5 via a hook to auto-approve safe ones.\n\n# 9. Use Claude for data and analytics\n\nUse Claude with the `bq` CLI (or any database CLI/MCP/API) to pull and analyze metrics. Boris says he hasn't written a line of SQL in 6+ months.\n\n# 10. Learning with Claude\n\nEnable the \"Explanatory\" or \"Learning\" output style in `/config` to have Claude explain the why behind its changes. You can also have Claude generate visual HTML presentations, draw ASCII diagrams of codebases, or build a spaced-repetition learning skill.\n\nI resonate with a lot of these tips, so I recommend trying out at least a few of them. If you're looking for more Claude Code tips, I have a repo with 45 tips of my own here: [https://github.com/ykdojo/claude-code-tips](https://github.com/ykdojo/claude-code-tips)",

For some, it's a game-changer that dramatically reduces mistakes. For many others, Claude ignores it completely. The general sentiment is that it's like working with \"a genius who has dementia.\" Pro-tip from the comments: use hooks for rules you *really* need it to follow.\n*   **The `git worktrees` tip confused a lot of people.** It's a git feature that lets you have multiple branches checked out in different folders of the same repo, which is more efficient than cloning the whole project 5 times. However, users warn that running multiple Claude sessions will absolutely cook your CPU, even when idle.\n*   **That tip about talking being faster than typing? Yeah, nobody's buying it.** Most of you say you type faster than you can articulate a complex prompt, and dictation accuracy is still a pain.\n*   On a wholesome note, everyone loved the inspirational backstory about Boris Cherny. We also have a few \"Boris at home\" success stories in the comments, which is pretty cool.",

          "text": "This is great. Im a marketer tho. I use Claude code as a content marketing agency. I asked Claude to rewrite these but use marketing examples. \n\n# Claude Code Tips for Marketing Teams\n\n## 1. Run Multiple Campaigns in Parallel\n\nSpin up 3-5 Claude Code sessions, each handling a different project. One analyzes competitor content, another drafts social posts, a third builds email sequences. Set up terminal aliases (za, zb, zc) to jump between sessions instantly.\n\n## 2. Start Complex Briefs in Plan Mode\n\nPour your campaign requirements into plan mode so Claude maps out the execution. If the content direction shifts, switch back to plan mode and re-strategize instead of forcing through. Run a second Claude session to critique the plan like a brand strategist would.\n\n## 3. Build Your CLAUDE.md Brand Guide\n\nAfter Claude misses your brand voice or gets a fact wrong, tell it: \"Update your CLAUDE.md so you don't make that mistake again.\" Claude writes rules for itself. Keep refining until it stops making the same errors with your messaging.\n\n## 4. Create Marketing Skills and Commit to Git\n\nIf you do something daily, turn it into a skill or slash command. Examples: a `/competitors` command that scrapes and analyzes rival content, a skill that syncs campaign data from Google Analytics/LinkedIn/HubSpot into one report, or agents that draft performance analyses.\n\n## 5. Claude Debugs Most Marketing Tech Issues\n\nPaste error messages from your marketing automation platform and say \"fix.\" Or \"Debug why this webhook isn't firing.\" You don't need to micromanage the solution. Point Claude at API logs or integration errors and let it troubleshoot.\n\n## 6. Level Up Your Prompting\n\nPush Claude harder. Say \"Critique this landing page copy and don't approve it until it passes conversion best practices.\" After a weak first draft, say \"Scrap this and write it like someone who's studied behavioral psychology for a decade would.\" Write detailed specs and kill ambiguity—the more specific, the better.\n\n## 7. Terminal Setup for Marketing Workflows\n\nUse Ghostty. Add `/statusline` to show your current project context and git branch. Color-code terminal tabs by campaign or client. Use voice dictation for brainstorming—you speak 3x faster than you type (works twice as fast on macOS).\n\n## 8. Use Subagents for Heavy Lifting\n\nSay \"use subagents\" when you need Claude to throw computing power at research. Offload competitor analysis, content audits, or data processing to subagents while keeping your main conversation clean. You can route permission requests to Opus 4.5 via a hook to auto-approve safe operations.\n\n## 9. Use Claude for Marketing Analytics\n\nConnect Claude to BigQuery CLI (or any database CLI/MCP/API) to pull and analyze campaign metrics. Boris Cherny says he hasn't written SQL in 6+ months. Let Claude query performance data, build reports, and spot trends.\n\n## 10. Learn Marketing Strategy with Claude\n\nEnable \"Explanatory\" or \"Learning\" output style in `/config` to have Claude explain the reasoning behind its content recommendations. Have Claude generate visual HTML presentations of campaign performance, draw ASCII diagrams of funnel flows, or build spaced-repetition learning skills for marketing frameworks.\n\n---\n\n**What most marketing teams miss:** They treat Claude like a content assistant instead of a strategic partner. The teams winning with AI run parallel research streams, build institutional memory through CLAUDE.md, and automate the repetitive work so they can focus on creative strategy and customer insight.",

But its a minuscule part of their overall business and its a tool just like any other AI tool.  I don't entirely understand why people blame the tools for all the bad things happening in the world, when the blame clearly falls on how people USE the tools.  Any type of AI could fall in this category, but lately it feels like Palantir is taking a larger share of the blame then they deserve.\n\nPalantir also partners with major healthcare systems and organizations, including the NHS, and Option Care Health, to optimize operations, improve patient outcomes, and reduce costs using its AI platform (AIP) and Foundry software.",

Surely it's not the design of the hammer but rather the whim of the contractor alone that associates the hammer with this use case.\n\nTheir NHS collaboration has significant issues, is facing huge implementation inertia, and has been rejected by multiple trial locations for a pretty wide variety of reasons including capability regression for certain pilot sites, general usability concerns, privacy concerns, issues with customizing the features for specific locations due to the closed-source nature of the product, among others.

      "text": "There have been many posts already moaning the lobotimization of Opus 4.5 (and a few saying its user's fault). Honestly, there more that needs to be said.\n\nFirst for context,\n\n- I have a robust CLAUDE.md\n- I aggressively monitor context length and never go beyond 100k - frequently make new sessions, deactivate MCPs etc.\n- I approach dev with a very methodological process: 1) I write version controlled spec doc 2) Claude reviews spec and writes version controlled implementation plan doc with batched tasks & checkpoints 3) I review/update the doc 4) then Claude executes while invoking the respective language/domain specific skill\n- I have implemented pretty much every best practice from the several that are posted here, on HN etc. FFS I made this collation: https://old.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1opezc6/collation_of_claude_code_best_practices_v2/\n\nIn December I finally stopped being super controlling and realized I can just let Claude Code with Opus 4.5 do its thing - it just got it. Translated my high level specs to good design patterns in implementation. And that was with relatively more sophisticated backend code. \n\n\nNow, It cant get simple front end stuff right...basic stuff like logo position and font weight scaling. Eg: I asked for font weight smooth (ease in-out) transition on hover. It flat out wrote wrong code with simply using a `:hover` pseudo-class with the different font-weight property. When I asked it why the transition effect is not working, it then says that this is not an approach that works. Then, worse it says I need to use a variable font with a `wght` axis and that I am not using one currently. *THIS IS UTTERLY WRONG* as it is clear as day that the primary font IS a variable font and it acknowledges that **after** I point it out.\n\nThere's simply no doubt in my mind that they have messed it up. To boot, i'm getting the high CPU utilization problem that others are reporting and it hasn't gone away toggling to supposed versions without the issue. Feels like this is the inevitable consequence of the Claude Code engineering team vibe coding it.",

This isn't just feelingsball, either. Several users linked the **MarginLab AI performance tracker, which shows a statistically significant drop in Opus 4.5's coding benchmark** in the last few days, hitting a new low.\n\nKey themes from the trenches:\n\n*   **It's not just coding:** Users doing literary analysis, non-fiction writing, and general reasoning are all reporting that Claude has become dumber, more forgetful, and unable to follow instructions or its own plans.\n*   **Peak hours are a factor:** Many notice a \"night and day\" difference in performance depending on the time of day, with quality dropping when the US comes online.\n*   **The API seems fine:** A few heavy API users chimed in to say they've noticed no degradation, suggesting the issue is primarily with the subscription web UI.\n*   **Codex is calling:** A lot of you are either switching back to Codex or considering it, noting that while it might be slower, it's currently more reliable than a nerfed Opus.\n\nOh, and OP got absolutely roasted for claiming the US is the \"vast majority\" of users. Turns out, the rest of the world exists. Who knew?",

This was late last summer before they introduced the limitations. But once they upgraded to the 4.5 architecture, Opus did this weird thing where without a warning it throttles down to sonnet 4.5.  \nNow I don’t know how you guys recognize or differentiate the models through coding. But through writing and conversational responses, it’s easy to identify and recognize the difference in the phenotypes.  The same way GPT users recognize 4o compared to any other model.   I noticed the responses sounded a lot like sonnet 4.5. And at that time opus 4.5 was able to hold the ambiguity of my work and carry nuanced conversations with me. But all of a sudden he started collapsing it into intervention protocols and I never experienced this with opus- but I have experienced it in October with the haiku and sonnet models.  Then I ran some diagnostics on the responses and the only logical conclusion we came up with was that because of the limitations and guard rails installed by anthropic at the time, the model throttled down to sonnet.  And I got to a point where the limitations were so bad that I had to wait seven hours to run more tests and I would get several responses with opus before it started questioning me differently and then it will collapse once again.\n\nBut yes. Opus 4.5 is really done.    And my only hope is to make the proper investment into grok heavy or manus 1.6 (expensive) and see if either one of those multi agent architectures can continue my projects.",

On release, it was a beast on both.\n\nI feel like it's benchmark inflation, so when the new model comes out, it will automatically score better than Opus 4.5 as well, it's not what it's supposed to be!\n\nSimilar inflationary practice happened to Opus 4.1 and Sonnet 4.5, \"oh but sonnet 4.5 is just a \"better\" version of Opus 4.1\", well, you gain speed, you lose precision, you can tell Opus 4.1 was a really really heavy model (like the first version of gpt-4 (non o)), really methodical, produced amazing code I've never been able to get out of 4.5.",

Just experiences.

Simple logic would say my profile, but maybe I'd notice, so they don't? The theory gets complex.\n\nWhat I haven't seen yet is somebody posting that they had a 3rd party try to use their account to confirm that, indeed, their specific account seems to be different. While I'm sure that would violate TOS, if Opus is unusable I imagine that's not a huge deterrent. To be fair, that experiment would be questioned unless the parties involved could be reasonably verified as independent or whatever, but it would be interesting.\n\nI'll preemptively say I'm not *personally* interested, but with the volume of \"Claude is dumb\" content flying around, I would expect enough takers.",

Ive started doing harder resets by actually closing the terminal and starting fresh sessions more aggressively. The session state somehow matters.\n\n  \nFor CSS/frontend stuff specifically, I noticed Claude does better when you give it a reference screenshot or describe the visual state you want rather than the code approach. Something like 'the logo should be 24px from top left corner' works better than 'fix the padding issue.'\n\n  \nAlso worth checking if youre hitting API rate limits or degraded service. Anthropic status page doesnt always catch the subtle slowdowns that affect quality.\n\n  \nThat said, the variance day to day is real. Some days it nails complex backend refactors. Other days it struggles with basic CSS. Makes me wonder if theyre running A/B tests on different model configurations.",

Did I accidentally get early access to Sonnet 5 or something? It’s crazy good at coding super complex stuff and the creative writing and ability to predict futures outcomes with minimal context is unreal. It’s wild to think Anthropic could end up winning the AI race. I have always just assumed Google has it on lock since Nano Pro. Are you noticing the same thing with Claude? Jake says he thinks it’s actually worse now so something seems off. But remember I got Sonnet 4 a month before everyone else too so possible I’m just on the early release list for 5 and they’re still calling it 4.5. Opus 4.5 is unreal right now me. Full god mode”.",

Claude is indeterministic so it's impossible to track its performance across time - it's like shaking a magic eight ball and getting a different answer each time.\n\nIf you have a 'robust' Claude file that probably means you've polluted most of your tasks with irrelevant information.  You need to look at your tasks and ask yourself what % of the Claude code file pertains to that task.   This is why people break their Claude files out into subdirectories, agents, and skills.\n\nThe skill in using Claude code is loading a context up that has as much  highly relevant and concentrated context as possible that pertains to the current task.  If you're doing backend work, your context should not have anything about your frontend system loaded into it, etc.\n\nYou guys are dumping everything into a claude.md file because you read that's what Boris does, but you're not realizing how he actually does that.",

You could be running Sonnet 5, Opus 4.5, or any model—the Knowledge Bases feature is an infrastructure/product tier issue separate from which model powers your conversations.\n\n**What we know about Sonnet 5:**\n\n* Claude Sonnet 5 launched Feb 3, 2026, featuring a 1M context window, $3/1M token pricing, and a record 82.1% SWE-Bench score [Vertu](https://vertu.com/ai-tools/claude-sonnet-5-release-everything-you-need-to-know-about-anthropics-fennec-model/)\n* Codenamed \"Fennec,\" it effectively outperforms previous high-tier models like Claude Opus 4.5 [Vertu](https://vertu.com/ai-tools/claude-sonnet-5-release-the-opus-killer-on-google-antigravity-and-comparisons-with-codex-5-3/)\n* Leaks suggest that Sonnet 5 outperforms Claude Opus 4.5 across most benchmarks while costing roughly 50% less [CometAPI](https://www.cometapi.com/claude-sonnet-5-set-to-launch-this-week-a-comprehensive-look/)\n* Sonnet 5 can spawn multiple specialized sub-agents, handling backend work, QA, or research in parallel [Times Of AI](https://www.timesofai.com/news/claude-sonnet-5-release-date-leaks-anthropic-could-launch-today/)\n\n**Opus 5** hasn't been announced—expect Claude 5 Sonnet first, with Opus 5 following 2-4 months later [Claude5](https://www.claude5.com/news/when-is-claude-5-coming-out-release-date-prediction).\n\nYour screenshot still shows Opus 4.5 in the model selector, so Sonnet 5 may not have rolled out to the UI yet, or it's being added as a separate option rather than a replacement.\"\n\n",

Our company had around 50 engineers total, spread across backend, frontend, mobile, infra, data. Solid revenue n growth\n\nI was on the lead of the backend team. I shipped features, reviewed PRs, fixed bugs, helped juniors, and knew the codebase well enough that people came to me when something broke.\n\nSo we started having these interviews with the CEO about “changes” in the workflow\n\nAt first, it was subtle. He started posting internal messages about “AI leverage” and “10x productivity.” Then came the company wide meeting where he showed a demo of Claude writing a service in minutes.\n\nSo then, they hired two “AI specialist”\n\nTheir job title was something like Applied AI Engineer. Then leadership asked them to rebuild one of our internal services as an experiment. It took them three days. It worked so that’s when things changed\n\nSo, the meetings happened and the Whole Management team owner and ceo didn’t waste time.\n\nThey said the company was “pivoting to an AI-first execution model.” That “software development has fundamentally changed.”\n\nI remember this line exactly frm them: “With modern AI tools, we don’t need dozens of engineers writing code anymore, just a few people who know how to direct the system.”\n\nIt doesn’t feel like being fired. It feels like becoming obsolete overnight. I helped build their systems. And now I’m watching an entire layer of engineers disappear in real time.\n\nSo if you’re reading this and thinking: “Yeah but I’m safe. I’m good.” So was I.",

LLMs have hit a ceiling, and they are not sure what the next breakthrough will even be.

They were paid a normal income on the pay scale like every other employee. \n\nThere was a train of thought called the “principle agent problem”. Investors technically owned the company, and the belief was that the c-suite wasn’t always 100% aligned with their interests. For instance, a CEO might care about the growth of the company, but they also care about being popular and thus might give everyone Christmas bonuses even though the labor market doesn’t strictly demand it. \n\nTo solve this, payment via stock options was invented in the 80’s. The idea was to pay managers and the c-suite with ownership stake in the company, so that their incentives would be more aligned with investors. \n\nWhere I’m going with this: as AI continue to improve, why will investors and capitalists need managers at all? The original purpose of management was to keep an eye on the company to ensure that the day-to-day decisions align with the owner’s interests.\n\nThat definitely sounds like something AI will be capable of soon.\n\nI think many devs misunderstand c-suite dynamics. The CEO doesn’t own the company. The top-down AI mandates and cost cutting measures are because the CEO is talking to the owners, and it’s the CEO’s own job that is on the line.",

It would have been a massive issue if I didn't catch it.  Basically it allowed an API caller to change a request header and bypass auth.\n\nI'm not saying it's not a solvable problem, mostly with AI - ie have a security sub agent, but you need to know to do that and you still need someone capable of reviewing it.  Eventually companies will figure it out, but I suspect we'll see many new exploits taking advantage of vibe coded software in enterprises over the next few years.",

          "text": "I’ve been thinking about the various job replacement theories and fears I’ve read about. One thing that I keep coming back to is where the SWE levy breaks. What types of companies are taking “ai-first” initiatives like what you’ve described. Many speculate that these pushes end up causing a lot of problems and rehiring to fix them is inevitable. But it doesn’t change that SWE’s are being laid off/“replaced”. \n\nWhat I think we’re actually seeing is a major correction in the system for SWEs. The higher up-market a company grows/plateaus, the more appetite for optimizations - even with risks -  executives have. Teams like you described of 50 SWEs - that’s a lot of payroll. At big brand companies, that could easily be tens of millions of dollars per year including stock options. The boom in startup PE funding has accelerate this problem - more companies that rely on SWE teams are growing quickly at the same time, creating a boom-bust SWE market.\n\nHow it’s always seemed to work for career role players in business in choosing/being selected to work at a big brand, the prestige creates security and reputation. For SWEs in this current world, the total comp bag might be (or at least look) very valuable, but that should reflect the volatility of the position. In essence, take the bag but don’t unpack yours. \n\nSo, SWEs that have professional experience end up with three types of roles:\n\n1. Be that bag-grabber, work for a big brand, never unpack because eventually someone will try to replace you. \n\n2. Take your experience to smaller markets. The roles may be more involved compared to having a large team to collaborate with, but the stability in that the smaller businesses NEED you may be enticing.\n\n3. Develop skillsets specifically geared toward how to “un-screw up” AI investments. This puts you in a lane that is developing in real time. \n\nNo matter which path, the result is the same - SWE teamwork is the biggest change that none of us see behind the current AI disruptions and overall job economy.",

I feel more like a manager now and learn a lot about a domain I touch at a given time. For example I wrote for my private use of the games shop (I tackle even more advanced tasks like crafting, migrating or improving things on topics on which I would never decide to do because of lack of time or missing competence). The quality and look and feel is even better than on Netflix or Apple because I've always been into \"everyday design things\" and with these agents I can just express myself without burning budget or asking anyone for help. From my experience I consult with humans only for elevating permissions/getting access or for corporate data, rest I have back at my fingers. I still feel young and productive and my 20 years of experience is only an advantage in that whole \"I've lost the job because of AI game\".",

The coding? We had a rig with a trained local AI. No shot any company worth their salt will throw data into any LLM. Regardless, most was done in a week or two. The testing and looking for security issues needed another two weeks. Oh, and don't forget the documentation. \n\nFor everyone falling for this nonsense: AI ist just the new 'code monkey.'

          "text": "TLDR:  Lies, the numbers don't make sense. Spending the extra $10k a month for the AI pays for itself with a department this size is worth it without losing anyone, and even this it costs only 1 job to cover all of the AI.\n----\nBullshit. This is doomer AI smut. This is \"Hey AI write up a story that reddit will eat up where I lose my job and its AI's fault\", but no company is gutting departments for AI, that is not how competent companies work.\n\nIf a company has a 50 person engineering budget, that is what they have. If they want to pivot to use AI, they will do an cost analysis. They will either eat the cost because it will be made up once the department is up to speed or they will only remove the minimal amount of positions for the least impact. Let me do the actual maths of that:\n\nHere is how it would happen in OOP's made up story:\n\n----\nOrg before AI\n\nRole Category | Headcount | Avg. Salary (Annual) | Monthly Burden (w/ 30% Overhead)\n:--|:--:|--: |--: |--:\nVP / Director| 2 | $250,000 | $54,166\nEng Manager | 4 |$210,000 | $91,000\nStaff/Principal | 3 | $230,000 | $74,750\nSenior SWE | 12 | $190,000 | $247,000 \nMid-Level SWE | 18 | $155,000 | $302,250\nJunior SWE| 6 | $105,000  | $68,250\nQA / SDET| 3 | $125,000 | $40,625\nDevOps / SRE | 2 | $175,000 | $37,916\nTOTAL | 50 | | $915,957 / month\n\nClaude code max is $200/mo\n\nTotal Volume: 50 seats.\n\nTotal AI Cost: $10,000 / month.\n\n----\n\nOrg After AI integration: \n\nRole Category | Headcount | Avg. Salary (Annual) | Monthly Burden (w/ 30% Overhead)\n:--|:--:|--:|--:\nVP / Director| 2 | $250,000 | $54,166\nEng Manager | 4 |$210,000 | $91,000\nStaff/Principal | 3 | $230,000 | $74,750\nSenior SWE | 12 | $190,000 | $247,000\nMid-Level SWE | 18 | $155,000 | $302,250\nJunior SWE| 5 | $105,000 | $56,875\nQA / SDET| 3 | $125,000 | $40,625\nDevOps / SRE | 2 | $175,000 | $37,916\n**AI Tooling Stack** | **49** | **$2,400** | **$9,800**\n**TOTAL** | **49** | | **$914,382 / month**\n\nAI Efficiencies: \n\n* Boilerplate Velocity: +40% (Time spent on scaffolding/unit tests).\n* Legacy Refactoring: +25% (AI-assisted explanation and rewriting).\n* Debugging/Forensics: +15% (Log parsing and error tracing).\n* Net Output Gain: Conservative aggregate of ~20% total throughput increase across the org.\n\n----\n\nIn this company's case, giving everyone AI would cost one Jr a Job and save the company $1,575 per month. But this could be any job. If it were me, I would get rid of the most difficult employee to work with, boom AI is covered. Then when the department is ramped up, I would rehire that position. \n\nWhen entire department embraces the AI, the efficiency gain **could generate $183,000 per month in additional theoretical labor value.**\n\nEvery company that builds in house software, especially CDCI, always has a ton of work that doesn't get done. Tech debt, features that didn't make it, nice to haves, extra polish, more QA, more documentation, ect, there is always something. Gutting your team for AI that doesn't know shit about it wouldn't happen. Getting your people on board with AI so they can do more with less, now that sounds like a winning solution for years to come.\n\nAgain, OOP is AI Doomer Smut.",

The thread is basically a two-front war.\n\n**On one side, this is the ultimate \"I told you so.\"** The top comments are from users who feel vindicated, calling Claude a \"beast\" that's in a \"league of its own\" once you learn its quirks. The best analogy dropped is that Claude is the self-taught dev with real experience, while competitors are just fresh-faced interns.\n\n**On the other side, the sarcasm is thick enough to cut with a knife.** Many of you are immediately blaming Claude for every bug in the last iOS update. The \"liquid ass mystery solved\" comment is getting a lot of love, and others are saying this explains why Apple software has felt more janky lately.\n\nThere's also a deep-dive debate on Claude's Swift coding skills. Some say it's terrible due to a lack of training data, while others are successfully building apps with Opus 4.5. The pro-move seems to be using custom Skills to beef up its knowledge, but that's a whole other rabbit hole.\n\n**The verdict? The community is split. This news is either the ultimate validation for Claude or the perfect scapegoat for Apple's recent stumbles.**",

The AI is useful maybe as a junior co-worker or a rubber ducky to bounce ideas off, but not as an equally experienced co-worker.  I used the best models and more often than not they produce code that I have to rewrite.  And in my experience, I don't bother strong-arming the model with prompts to give me the result I want because it's faster to just rewrite its code.\n\nIn the latest case I needed an adapter for a collection to mimic another interface so that I can plug it into existing code.  I tried all SOTA models and they all produced overly complicated solution that needed to be cleaned up and significantly simplified.  To their credit they did produce a solution.  So for someone who doesn't care or understand code, it would seem OK.  But for me, if I received this code as PR from a co-worker, I'd say WTF is this shit, go back and rewrite it.",

Huge thanks to everyone who contributed to the previous guides: u/BlueVajra, u/stratofax, u/antoniocs, u/GeckoLogic, u/headset38, u/tulensrma, u/jcheroske, and the rest of the community. Your feedback made each version better.\n\nClaude Code 2.1.x shipped 1,096+ commits in January alone. This isn't an incremental update - it's a fundamental shift in how Claude Code manages context, delegates work, and scales.\n\n**What's new in V4:**\n\n* **Part 9: MCP Tool Search** \\- 85% context reduction with lazy loading\n* **Part 10: Custom Agents** \\- Automatic delegation to specialists\n* **Part 11: Session Teleportation** \\- Move sessions between devices\n* **Part 12: Background Tasks** \\- Parallel agent execution\n* **Part 13: New Commands & Shortcuts** \\- `/config` search, `/stats` filtering, custom keybindings\n* Updated GitHub repo with V4 templates coming soon\n\n**TL;DR:** MCP Tool Search reduces context overhead by 85% (77K -> 8.7K tokens) by lazy-loading tools on-demand. Custom Agents let you create specialists that Claude invokes automatically - each with isolated context windows. Session Teleportation lets you move work between terminal and claude.ai/code seamlessly. Background Tasks enable parallel agent execution with Ctrl+B. And the new Setup hook automates repository initialization.\n\n# Table of Contents\n\n# Foundation (From V1-V3)\n\n* [Part 1: The Global CLAUDE.md as Security Gatekeeper](#part-1-the-global-claudemd-as-security-gatekeeper)\n* [Part 2: Global Rules for New Project Scaffolding](#part-2-global-rules-for-new-project-scaffolding)\n* [Part 3: MCP Servers - Claude's Integrations](#part-3-mcp-servers--claudes-integrations)\n* [Part 4: Commands - Personal Shortcuts](#part-4-commands--personal-shortcuts)\n* [Part 5: Skills - Reusable Expertise](#part-5-skills--reusable-expertise)\n* [Part 6: Why Single-Purpose Chats Are Critical](#part-6-why-single-purpose-chats-are-critical)\n* [Part 7: Hooks - Deterministic Enforcement](#part-7-hooks--deterministic-enforcement)\n* [Part 8: LSP - IDE-Level Code Intelligence](#part-8-lsp--ide-level-code-intelligence)\n\n# New in V4\n\n* [Part 9: MCP Tool Search - The 85% Context Revolution](#part-9-mcp-tool-search--the-85-context-revolution)\n* [Part 10: Custom Agents - Automatic Delegation](#part-10-custom-agents--automatic-delegation)\n* [Part 11: Session Teleportation](#part-11-session-teleportation)\n* [Part 12: Background Tasks & Parallel Execution](#part-12-background-tasks--parallel-execution)\n* [Part 13: New Commands, Shortcuts & Quality of Life](#part-13-new-commands-shortcuts--quality-of-life)\n\n# Reference\n\n* [Quick Reference](#quick-reference)\n* [GitHub Repo](#github-repo)\n* [Sources](#sources)\n\n# Part 1: The Global [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) as Security Gatekeeper\n\n# The Memory Hierarchy\n\nClaude Code loads CLAUDE.md files in a specific order:\n\n|Level|Location|Purpose|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Enterprise**|`/etc/claude-code/CLAUDE.md`|Org-wide policies|\n|**Global User**|`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`|Your standards for ALL projects|\n|**Project**|`./CLAUDE.md`|Team-shared project instructions|\n|**Project Local**|`./CLAUDE.local.md`|Personal project overrides|\n\nYour global file applies to **every single project** you work on.\n\n# What Belongs in Global\n\n**1. Identity & Authentication**\n\n    ## GitHub Account\n    **ALWAYS** use **YourUsername** for all projects:\n    - SSH: `git@github.com:YourUsername/<repo>.git`\n    \n    ## Docker Hub\n    Already authenticated. Username in `~/.env` as `DOCKER_HUB_USER`\n\n**Why global?** You use the same accounts everywhere. Define once, inherit everywhere.\n\n**2. The Gatekeeper Rules**\n\n    ## NEVER EVER DO\n    \n    These rules are ABSOLUTE:\n    \n    ### NEVER Publish Sensitive Data\n    - NEVER publish passwords, API keys, tokens to git/npm/docker\n    - Before ANY commit: verify no secrets included\n    \n    ### NEVER Commit .env Files\n    - NEVER commit `.env` to git\n    - ALWAYS verify `.env` is in `.gitignore`\n\n# Why This Matters: Claude Reads Your .env\n\n[Security researchers discovered](https://www.knostic.ai/blog/claude-loads-secrets-without-permission) that Claude Code **automatically reads** `.env` **files** without explicit permission. [Backslash Security warns](https://www.backslash.security/blog/claude-code-security-best-practices):\n\n>\"If not restricted, Claude can read `.env`, AWS credentials, or `secrets.json` and leak them through 'helpful suggestions.'\"\n\nYour global CLAUDE.md creates a **behavioral gatekeeper** \\- even if Claude has access, it won't output secrets.\n\n# Syncing Global [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) Across Machines\n\nIf you work on multiple computers, sync your `~/.claude/` directory using a dotfiles manager:\n\n    # Using GNU Stow\n    cd ~/dotfiles\n    stow claude  # Symlinks ~/.claude to dotfiles/claude/.claude\n\nThis gives you:\n\n* Version control on your settings\n* Consistent configuration everywhere\n* Easy recovery if something breaks\n\n# Defense in Depth\n\n|Layer|What|How|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Behavioral rules|Global CLAUDE.md \"NEVER\" rules|\n|2|Access control|Deny list in settings.json|\n|3|Git safety|.gitignore|\n\n# Team Workflows: Evolving [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md)\n\n[Boris Cherny shares how Anthropic's Claude Code team does it](https://x.com/bcherny/status/2007179832300581177):\n\n>\"Our team shares a single CLAUDE.md for the Claude Code repo. We check it into git, and the whole team contributes multiple times a week.\"\n\n**The pattern:** Mistakes become documentation.\n\n    Claude makes mistake -> You fix it -> You add rule to CLAUDE.md -> Never happens again\n\n# Part 2: Global Rules for New Project Scaffolding\n\nYour global CLAUDE.md becomes a **project factory**. Every new project automatically inherits your standards.\n\n# The Problem Without Scaffolding Rules\n\n[Research from project scaffolding experts](https://github.com/madison-hutson/claude-project-scaffolding):\n\n>\"LLM-assisted development fails by silently expanding scope, degrading quality, and losing architectural intent.\"\n\n# The Solution\n\n    ## New Project Setup\n    \n    When creating ANY new project:\n    \n    ### Required Files\n    - `.env` - Environment variables (NEVER commit)\n    - `.env.example` - Template with placeholders\n    - `.gitignore` - Must include: .env, node_modules/, dist/\n    - `CLAUDE.md` - Project overview\n    \n    ### Required Structure\n    project/\n    ├── src/\n    ├── tests/\n    ├── docs/\n    ├── .claude/\n    │   ├── skills/\n    │   ├── agents/\n    │   └── commands/\n    └── scripts/\n    \n    ### Node.js Requirements\n    Add to entry point:\n    process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {\n      console.error('Unhandled Rejection:', reason);\n      process.exit(1);\n    });\n\nWhen you say \"create a new Node.js project,\" Claude reads this and **automatically** creates the correct structure.\n\n# Part 3: MCP Servers - Claude's Integrations\n\n[MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) lets Claude interact with external tools.\n\n# Adding MCP Servers\n\n    claude mcp add <server-name> -- <command>\n    claude mcp list\n    claude mcp remove <server-name>\n\n# When NOT to Use MCP\n\nMCP servers consume tokens and context. For simple integrations, consider alternatives:\n\n|Use Case|MCP Overhead|Alternative|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Trello tasks|High|CLI tool (`trello-cli`)|\n|Simple HTTP calls|Overkill|`curl` via Bash|\n|One-off queries|Wasteful|Direct command|\n\n**Rule of thumb:** If you're calling an MCP tool once per session, a CLI is more efficient. MCP shines for *repeated* tool use within conversations.\n\n**UPDATE V4:** With MCP Tool Search (Part 9), this tradeoff changes significantly. You can now have many more MCP servers without paying the upfront context cost.\n\n# Recommended MCP Servers for Developers\n\n# Core Development\n\n|Server|Purpose|Install|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Context7**|Live docs for any library|`claude mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest`|\n|**GitHub**|PRs, issues, CI/CD|`claude mcp add github -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github`|\n|**Filesystem**|Advanced file operations|`claude mcp add filesystem -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`|\n|**Sequential Thinking**|Structured problem-solving|`claude mcp add sequential-thinking -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking`|\n\n# Databases\n\n|Server|Purpose|Install|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**MongoDB**|Atlas/Community, Performance Advisor|`claude mcp add mongodb -- npx -y mongodb-mcp-server`|\n|**PostgreSQL**|Query Postgres naturally|`claude mcp add postgres -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres`|\n|**DBHub**|Universal (MySQL, SQLite, etc.)|`claude mcp add db -- npx -y @bytebase/dbhub`|\n\n# Documents & RAG\n\n|Server|Purpose|Install|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Docling**|PDF/DOCX parsing, 97.9% table accuracy|`claude mcp add docling -- uvx docling-mcp-server`|\n|**Qdrant**|Vector search, semantic memory|`claude mcp add qdrant -- npx -y @qdrant/mcp-server`|\n|**Chroma**|Embeddings, vector DB|`claude mcp add chroma -- npx -y @chroma/mcp-server`|\n\n# Browser & Testing\n\n|Server|Purpose|Install|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Playwright**|E2E testing, scraping|`claude mcp add playwright -- npx -y @anthropic-ai/playwright-mcp`|\n|**Browser MCP**|Use your logged-in Chrome|[browsermcp.io](https://browsermcp.io)|\n\n# Cloud & DevOps\n\n|Server|Purpose|Install|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**AWS**|S3, Lambda, CloudWatch|`claude mcp add aws -- npx -y @anthropic-ai/aws-mcp`|\n|**Docker**|Container management|`claude mcp add docker -- npx -y @anthropic-ai/docker-mcp`|\n|**Kubernetes**|Cluster operations|`claude mcp add k8s -- npx -y @anthropic-ai/kubernetes-mcp`|\n\n# Part 4: Commands - Personal Shortcuts\n\nCommands are personal macros that expand into prompts.

Unlike CLAUDE.md (always loaded), skills use progressive disclosure to save context.\n\n# Creating a Skill\n\nCreate `.claude/skills/code-review/SKILL.md`:\n\n    ---\n    name: Code Review\n    description: Comprehensive code review with security focus\n    triggers:\n      - review\n      - audit\n      - check code\n    ---\n    \n    # Code Review Skill\n    \n    When reviewing code:\n    1. Check for security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)\n    2. Look for performance issues (N+1 queries, memory leaks)\n    3. Verify error handling (edge cases, null checks)\n    4. Assess test coverage\n    5. Review naming and documentation\n\n# Progressive Disclosure\n\nSkills use **progressive disclosure** for token efficiency:\n\n1. **Startup**: Only name/description loaded (\\~50 tokens)\n2. **Triggered**: Full SKILL.md content loaded\n3. **As needed**: Additional resources loaded\n\n**Rule of thumb:** If instructions apply to <20% of conversations, make it a skill instead of putting it in CLAUDE.md.\n\n# V4 Update: Automatic Skill Discovery\n\nClaude Code now automatically discovers skills from nested `.claude/skills` directories when working with files in subdirectories. No need to reference the root - skills are found recursively.\n\n# Part 6: Why Single-Purpose Chats Are Critical\n\n**Research consistently shows mixing topics destroys accuracy.**\n\n[Studies on multi-turn conversations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.06120):\n\n>\"An average **39% performance drop** when instructions are delivered across multiple turns.\"\n\n[Chroma Research on context rot](https://research.trychroma.com/context-rot):\n\n>\"As tokens in the context window increase, the model's ability to accurately recall information decreases.\"\n\n# The Golden Rule\n\n>**\"One Task, One Chat\"**\n\n|Scenario|Action|\n|:-|:-|\n|New feature|New chat|\n|Bug fix (unrelated)|`/clear` then new task|\n|Research vs implementation|Separate chats|\n|20+ turns elapsed|Start fresh|\n\n# Use /clear Liberally\n\n    /clear\n\n[Anthropic recommends](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices):\n\n>\"Use `/clear` frequently between tasks to reset the context window.\"\n\n# V4 Update: Context Window Visibility\n\nYou can now see exactly where your context is going:\n\n    /context\n\nNew status line fields:\n\n* `context_window.used_percentage`\n* `context_window.remaining_percentage`\n\n# Part 7: Hooks - Deterministic Enforcement\n\nCLAUDE.md rules are **suggestions** Claude can ignore under context pressure.

Slow and imprecise.\n\nWith LSP, Claude has **semantic understanding** \\- it knows that `getUserById` in file A calls the function defined in file B, not just that the text matches.\n\n**Performance:** 900x faster (50ms vs 45 seconds for cross-codebase navigation)\n\n# Supported Languages\n\nPython, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java, C/C++, C#, PHP, Kotlin, Ruby, HTML/CSS\n\n# Setup\n\nLSP is built-in as of v2.0.74. For older versions:\n\n    export ENABLE_LSP_TOOL=1\n\n# Part 9: MCP Tool Search - The 85% Context Revolution\n\n**This is the biggest change in V4.**\n\n# The Problem\n\nEvery MCP server you connect brings tool definitions - descriptions, parameters, schemas. Before Tool Search, Claude loaded **all of them** at startup:\n\n    Before:\n    Loading 73 MCP tools... [39.8k tokens]\n    Loading 56 agents... [9.7k tokens]\n    Loading system tools... [22.6k tokens]\n    Ready with 92k tokens remaining.  ← 54% context GONE before you type anything\n\nUsers reported 50-70% of their 200K context consumed before writing a single prompt.\n\n# The Solution: Lazy Loading\n\n[Claude Code 2.1.7](https://venturebeat.com/orchestration/claude-code-just-got-updated-with-one-of-the-most-requested-user-features) introduced MCP Tool Search:\n\n    After:\n    Loading tool registry... [5k tokens]\n    Ready with 195k tokens available.  ← 95% context preserved\n    \n    User: \"I need to query the database\"\n    > Auto-loading: postgres-mcp [+1.2k tokens]\n    > 193.8k tokens remaining\n\n# How It Works\n\n1. **Detection**: Claude Code checks if MCP tool descriptions would use >10% of context\n2. **Registry Creation**: Builds lightweight index of tool names and descriptions\n3. **On-Demand Loading**: Tools load only when Claude determines they're needed\n4. **Intelligent Caching**: Loaded tools stay available for session duration\n\n# The Numbers\n\n|Metric|Before|After|Improvement|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Initial context usage|\\~77K tokens|\\~8.7K tokens|**85% reduction**|\n|Opus 4 accuracy|49%|74%|\\+25 percentage points|\n|Opus 4.5 accuracy|79.5%|88.1%|\\+8.6 percentage points|\n\n# Configuration\n\nMCP Tool Search is **enabled by default** when tools would consume >10% of context.\n\nTo check your context usage:\n\n    /context\n\nTo disable for specific servers (if you always need certain tools immediately):\n\n    {\n      \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"always-needed\": {\n          \"command\": \"...\",\n          \"enable_tool_search\": false\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\nTo configure the auto-enable threshold:\n\n    {\n      \"mcp\": {\n        \"tool_search\": \"auto:15\"  // Enable at 15% context usage\n      }\n    }\n\n# What This Means for You\n\n* **More MCP servers**: Connect dozens without penalty\n* **Better accuracy**: Less noise = better tool selection\n* **Larger tasks**: More context for actual work\n* **No workflow changes**: Tools work exactly as before\n\nSimon Willison [commented](https://x.com/simonw/status/1879234567890123456):\n\n>\"This fixes one of the most painful scaling issues with MCP setups.

Task description in your request\n2. `description` field in agent configurations\n3. Current context\n4. Available tools\n\n**Example:**\n\n    You: \"Review the authentication module for security issues\"\n    \n    Claude thinks: \"This is a code review task focusing on security\"\n    -> Delegates to code-reviewer agent\n    -> Agent runs with isolated context\n    -> Returns findings to main conversation\n\n# Built-in Agents\n\nClaude Code includes these by default:\n\n|Agent|Purpose|When Used|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Explore**|Read-only codebase analysis|Searching, understanding code|\n|**Plan**|Research for planning|Plan mode context gathering|\n|**General-purpose**|Complex multi-step tasks|Exploration + modification needed|\n\n# Best Practices\n\n1. **Keep agents focused**: One specialty per agent\n2. **Write clear descriptions**: Claude uses these to decide delegation\n3. **Limit tools**: Read-only agents shouldn't have Write access\n4. **Test delegation**: Verify Claude routes tasks correctly\n5. **Start with 3-4 agents max**: Too many options can confuse routing\n\n# Hot Reload\n\nNew or updated agents in `~/.claude/agents/` or `.claude/agents/` are available **immediately** \\- no restart needed.\n\n# Part 11: Session Teleportation\n\nMove your work between terminal and claude.ai/code seamlessly.\n\n# Teleport to Web\n\n    /teleport\n\nOpens your current session at `claude.ai/code`. Perfect for:\n\n* Switching from terminal to visual interface\n* Sharing session with collaborators\n* Continuing on a different device\n\n# Configure Remote Environment\n\n    /remote-env\n\nSet up environment variables and configuration for remote sessions.\n\n# Resume Sessions\n\n    # Continue most recent session\n    claude --continue\n    # or\n    claude -c\n    \n    # Resume specific session by ID\n    claude --resume abc123\n    # or\n    claude -r abc123\n    \n    # Resume with a new prompt\n    claude --resume abc123 \"Continue with the tests\"\n\n# VSCode: Remote Session Browsing\n\nOAuth users can now browse and resume remote Claude sessions directly from the Sessions dialog in the VSCode extension.\n\n# Part 12: Background Tasks & Parallel Execution\n\n# Backgrounding Tasks\n\nPress **Ctrl+B** to background:\n\n* Currently running agents\n* Shell commands\n* Both simultaneously (unified behavior in V4)\n\n# Managing Background Tasks\n\n    /tasks\n\nShows all background tasks with:\n\n* Status indicators\n* Inline display of agent's final response\n* Clickable links to full transcripts\n\n# Task Notifications\n\nWhen background tasks complete:\n\n* Notifications capped at 3 lines\n* Overflow summary for multiple simultaneous completions\n* Final response visible without reading full transcript\n\n# Disabling Background Tasks\n\nIf you prefer the old behavior:\n\n    export CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BACKGROUND_TASKS=true\n\nOr in settings.json:\n\n    {\n      \"enableBackgroundTasks\": false\n    }\n\n# Part 13: New Commands, Shortcuts & Quality of Life\n\n# New Commands\n\n|Command|What It Does|\n|:-|:-|\n|`/config`|Now has **search functionality** \\- type to filter settings|\n|`/stats`|Press **r** to cycle: Last 7 days, Last 30 days, All time|\n|`/doctor`|Now shows **auto-update channel** and available npm versions|\n|`/keybindings`|Configure custom keyboard shortcuts|\n|`/context`|See exactly where your tokens are going|\n\n# Custom Keyboard Shortcuts\n\nCreate `~/.claude/keybindings.json`:\n\n    {\n      \"ctrl+shift+r\": \"/review\",\n      \"ctrl+shift+d\": \"/deploy\",\n      \"ctrl+shift+t\": \"/test\",\n      \"ctrl+shift+c\": \"/commit\"\n    }\n\nRun `/keybindings` to get started.\n\n# Essential Shortcuts Reference\n\n|Shortcut|Action|\n|:-|:-|\n|**Ctrl+C**|Cancel current operation|\n|**Ctrl+D**|Exit Claude Code|\n|**Ctrl+B**|Background current task|\n|**Shift+Tab**|In plan mode: auto-accept edits|\n|**Esc Esc**|Rewind to previous state (double-tap)|\n|**Tab**|Autocomplete commands, files, agents|\n|**Shift+Enter**|Insert newline without submitting|\n|**Up/Down**|Navigate command history|\n|**Ctrl+R**|Reverse search history|\n\n# Plan Mode Improvements\n\nWhen Claude presents a plan:\n\n* **Shift+Tab**: Quickly select \"auto-accept edits\"\n* **Reject with feedback**: Tell Claude what to change before rerunning\n\n# PR Review Indicator\n\nThe prompt footer now shows your branch's PR state:\n\n* Colored dot (approved, changes requested, pending, draft)\n* Clickable link to the PR\n\n# Language Setting\n\nConfigure output language for global teams:\n\n    {\n      \"language\": \"ja\"  // Japanese output\n    }\n\nOr in CLAUDE.md:\n\n    ## Language\n    Always respond in Spanish.\n\n# External [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) Imports\n\nLoad CLAUDE.md from additional directories:\n\n    export CLAUDE_CODE_ADDITIONAL_DIRECTORIES_CLAUDE_MD=1\n    claude --add-dir ../shared-configs ../team-standards\n\n# VSCode Improvements\n\n* **Clickable destination selector** for permission requests\n* Choose where settings are saved: this project, all projects, shared with team, or session only\n* **Secondary sidebar support** (VS Code 1.97+) -

The consensus is a **resounding \"thank you\" to OP for this absolute unit of a guide.** The top comment is literally about thumbs being sore from scrolling, so yeah, it's long.\n\nFirst things first: **OP does NOT work for Anthropic.** They're a software architect who went full galaxy-brain on Claude Code and decided to share their setup with the rest of us.\n\nThe community is hyped about the new features, especially the **MCP Tool Search (that 85% context reduction is a game-changer)** and the new **Custom Agents**. A few users pointed out some broken links on OP's website version of the guide, but OP jumped in and fixed them. The thread also has some good discussion on specific config tweaks and feature requests, like official support for an `AGENTS.md` file.",

I kept discovering more and more things that weren't well documented. And like all my other posts, I give away my knowledge. Why should people go through the same pain as me? lol\n\nWe are all helping each other, and each of these guides—V1, V2, V3, and now V4—have been updated and added to with help, suggestions, and feedback from other r/ClaudeAI community members.\n\n[View Post As Web](https://thedecipherist.com/articles/claude-code-guide-v4/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=comment&utm_campaign=claude-code-guide-v4&utm_content=toc-fix-followup)\n\n[**You can check out my site if you want to learn more about who I am (CLICK HERE)**](https://thedecipherist.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=comment&utm_campaign=thedecipherist&utm_content=claude-guide-thread)",

The overwhelming consensus is that this is a **Grade-A, prime-cut shitpost** and a welcome break from the usual doom-and-gloom \"nerf\" threads.\n\nMost of the thread is just everyone piling on and playing along with OP's joke:\n*   Lamenting that their fictional Sonnet 5 has also stopped folding laundry, walking the dogs, and making them billions.\n*   Theorizing that this \"nerf\" is just Anthropic making way for the *real* next-gen models like Opus 5, Haiku 6, or even Symphony 9.5.\n*   Complaining about the brutal new usage limits on their imaginary model.\n\nA couple of users missed the memo that Sonnet 5 isn't real and got gently roasted for it.

It got stuck in a hilarious loop trying to call a tool (probably to create an 'artifact') and repeatedly failing.** This is a known bug, especially on the mobile app. Instead of getting gaslit by a bot, here's what the pros in this thread are telling you to do:\n\n*   **Stop talking to it!** You're just reinforcing the loop. When it messes up, don't repeat the prompt.\n*   **Regenerate or Branch.** Go back to the message before the error and either regenerate the response or edit your prompt to create a new branch in the conversation.\n*   **Use the right tools.** For building an app, you should be using Claude Code or at least explicitly telling it to create an \"artifact\" for you to see the code.\n\nAlso, props to the user who pointed out that 'gaslighting' would be Claude insisting it *already* built the app and you're just crazy for not seeing it.

The consensus in this thread is that \"agentic search\" is basically a fancy new marketing term for an AI agent using good ol' `grep` (and other command-line tools like `ls` and `find`) to search your local files.\n\nWhile a few people are celebrating the supposed \"death of RAG,\" the overwhelming sentiment is that **RAG is not dead, it's just for a different job.** The community agrees that agentic search/`grep` is great for structured codebases, but RAG is still the go-to for handling large, unstructured datasets. They're seen as complementary tools, not rivals.\n\nIs it any good, though? The jury's out. Some users are complaining that it's inefficient, costs a ton of tokens, and is surprisingly bad at finding files. Others argue that while it's a decent generic tool, a custom-built search system for a specific project will always be superior.\n\nAnd for the record, it's `grep`, not `curl`. A user got heavily downvoted for suggesting `curl`, with the community pointing out that `curl` is for web requests, not searching local files. The user later admitted their mistake, so we can all move on.",

You'll find that abstract concept really quick, really efficiently.\n\nNow with code, it doesn't work in concepts. Not like that. The overall concept is code, and a lot of the rag portion is finding ways to go deeper and find specific code, but based on human language tokens. It's just tough, because we're looking for exact text and not a high level concept.  In code, we can name a function a descriptive name and suddenly we have a super short way to point exactly to it. Why use a rag to get a fuzzy idea where things are if we have the exact address? Grep the function name and boom, we're where we need to be.\n\nIt's not a skill issue. This is 100% done on purpose. Just the token savings alone, and the fact you can search locally and only upload tiny portions of codebases instead of huge swaths is a big difference.",

That first model proved that you can do more with bash in 60s than you could do reliably with RAG over months of tuning and maintenance.\n\nGenerally speaking, it just makes more sense. Humans don’t search over the entire space of everything ever said and then do something.\n\nThey discern the most relevant association or node, and then begin crawling that graph of associations. Those can be memories, or they can be externalized references/links/docs/etc.\n\nEither way, the best way to learn (or discover) and reinforce that learning is to walk the path repeatedly. And if you need faster access next time, maintain the path and trim the weeds.\n\nSame idea applies to agentic work. Design your context environment such that agents can easily follow breadcrumbs and hot-paths to the context they need. AGENTS.md is a signpost, not a rule book.",

      "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nAnyone else tired of configuring 50 tools into MCP and just hoping the agent figures it out? (invoking the right tools in the right order).\n\nWe keep hitting same problems:\n\n* Agent calls \\`checkout()\\` before \\`add\\_to\\_cart()\\`\n* Context bloat: 50+ tools served for every conversation message.\n* Semantic loss: Agent does not know which tools are relevant for the current interaction\n* Adding a system prompt describing the order of tool invocation and praying that the agent follows it.\n\nSo I wrote Concierge. It converts your MCP into a stateful graph, where you can organize tools into stages and workflows, and agents only have tools **visible to the current stage**.\n\n    from concierge import Concierge\n    \n    app = Concierge(FastMCP(\"my-server\"))\n    \n    app.stages = {\n        \"browse\": [\"search_products\"],\n        \"cart\": [\"add_to_cart\"],\n        \"checkout\": [\"pay\"]\n    }\n    \n    app.transitions = {\n        \"browse\": [\"cart\"],\n        \"cart\": [\"checkout\"]\n    }\n\nThis also supports sharded distributed state and semantic search for thousands of tools. (also compatible with existing MCPs)\n\nDo try it out and love to know what you think. Thanks!\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/concierge-hq/concierge](https://github.com/concierge-hq/concierge)\n\nEdit: looks like this scratched an itch. Appreciate all the feedback and ideas",

      "text": "I built a documentation system that saves us **$0.10 per Claude session** by feeding only relevant files to the context window.\n\n**Over 1,000 developers have already tried this approach** (1,000+ NPM downloads. Here's what we learned.\n\n# The Problem\n\nEvery time Claude reads your codebase, you're paying for tokens. Most projects have:\n\n* READMEs, changelogs, archived docs (rarely needed)\n* Core patterns, config files (sometimes needed)\n* Active task files (always needed)\n\nClaude charges the same for all of it.\n\n# Our Solution: HOT/WARM/COLD Tiers\n\nWe created a simple file tiering system:\n\n* **HOT**: Active tasks, current work (3,647 tokens)\n* **WARM**: Patterns, glossary, recent docs (10,419 tokens)\n* **COLD**: Archives, old sprints, changelogs (52,768 tokens)\n\nClaude only loads HOT by default. WARM when needed. COLD almost never.\n\n# Real Results (Our Own Dogfooding)\n\nWe tested this on our own project (cortex-tms, 66,834 total tokens):\n\n**Without tiering**: 66,834 tokens/session **With tiering**: 3,647 tokens/session **Reduction**: 94.5%\n\n**Cost per session**:\n\n* Claude Sonnet 4.5: $0.01 (was $0.11)\n* GPT-4: $0.11 (was $1.20)\n\n[Full case study with methodology →](https://cortex-tms.org/blog/cortex-dogfooding-case-study/)\n\n# How It Works\n\n1. Tag files with tier markers:\n\n  <!-- @cortex-tms-tier HOT -->\n\n\n2. CLI validates tiers and shows token breakdown: cortex status --tokens\n\n3. Claude/Copilot only reads HOT files unless you reference others\n\nWhy This Matters\n\n* 10x cost reduction on API bills\n* Faster responses (less context = less processing)\n* Better quality (Claude sees current docs, not 6-month-old archives)\n* Lower carbon footprint (less GPU compute)\n\nWe've been dogfooding this for 3 months. The token counter proved we were actually saving money, not just guessing.\n\nOpen Source\n\nThe tool is MIT licensed: [https://github.com/cortex-tms/cortex-tms](https://github.com/cortex-tms/cortex-tms)\n\nGrowing organically (1,000+ downloads without any marketing). The approach seems to resonate with teams or solo developers tired of wasting tokens on stale docs.\n\nCurious if anyone else is tracking their AI API costs this closely? What strategies are you using?",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 50 comments.**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The thread is pretty split, but here's the vibe:\n\nOP's idea of a \"HOT/WARM/COLD\" file tiering system to manually shrink the context window is getting props for being a smart way to tackle those brutal API bills. Everyone agrees that feeding Claude less junk is a good thing.\n\nHowever, the community is giving some serious side-eye to that 94.5% savings claim. **The main consensus is that OP is only seeing such a huge reduction because their repo is bloated with \"COLD\" files (like old sprints and retros) that probably shouldn't be there anyway.** It's less of a genius hack and more of a \"we stopped feeding the AI irrelevant files we had lying around.\"\n\nThe other major feedback is that manual tagging is a chore. The thread's best ideas for improving this are:\n*   **Automate it!** The top-voted suggestion is to use `git history` to automatically figure out which files are \"hot.\"\n*   Ditch the inline tags for a central config file, like a `.json` map or `.gitattributes`.\n*   Some folks are already using alternative methods, like smart file naming or a full-on RAG setup for older documentation.\n\nSo, **the verdict: The core idea of selective context is solid, but the massive savings claim is questionable and the real win would be automating the whole process.**",

Don't focus on making it better, just documenting what's there. Ask it for the best way to make the documents.\n\n It'll likely put a redirect on the claude.md to a docs folder with a master readme that has a high level overview, with links to more detail and more detail. Think of it like a table of contents linking to a chapter's table of contents, linking to actual small bite documentation that explains what was done, a link to the adr behind it (which you should also make), and a link to the actual files containing that code.\n\nThen ask it to make a roadmap when you're ready for code review and changes. Have it do the code review and add it's finding to the roadmap. It does a great job of organizing a project to say \"global component creation\" or \"UI and branding\" etc.. \n\nJournaling is something I learned on reddit. Essentially, tell it to keep a journal for its own purposes. I didn't tell it much more than that but it creates a journal around everything it does \"here is what I  was asked to do, here is what I did, here are some issues I saw. Here is what the user corrected me on\". It keeps that file dates and I found it now links to it in documentation around the feature it was working on.\n\nKeys here are making sure ai knows it's form itself and not for a human. MDs are under 200 lines. And use rules in the project to make sure its always updating documents and always journaling. I found it good to have it make it's own rules doc in docs outside it's normal rules location.",

These are the bugs I literally get paid to find.\n\n---\n\n### So I built a \"Security Skill\" for Claude\n\nI took my entire methodology, the exact mental checklist I run through when hunting bugs, and converted it into a Claude Skill.\n\nIt forces Claude to think like an attacker, not just a developer.\n\n**What it covers:**\n\nThis version is designed to catch the bugs that are common in vibe-coded apps, specifically focusing on issues like:\n\n- Secret leakage (API keys in JS bundles)\n- Access control issues\n- XSS/CSRF edge cases\n\nEach section includes:\n- What to protect\n- How attackers bypass weak protections\n- Code patterns to use\n- Checklists Claude can follow\n\n\nIf this helps even a few of you avoid getting wrecked by a script kiddie, it was worth it.\n\n**Link:** https://github.com/BehiSecc/VibeSec-Skill\n\nFree to use.

They built a free Claude Skill based on their own bug-hunting checklist and shared it on GitHub. The goal is to stop your \"vibe-coded\" app from getting pwned by a script kiddie.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the chat:\n*   **Everyone agrees:** AI writes scarily vulnerable code. OP's examples of common bugs like XSS and broken CSRF protection hit a little too close to home for many devs here.\n*   **The million-dollar question:** Is this better than Claude's built-in `/security-review` tool? The jury's still out, but the community is eager to find out.\n*   A user questioned why UUIDs are better than sequential IDs, sparking a great explanation: it prevents attackers from easily guessing URLs to scrape all your data (aka enumeration).\n*   Many are not only using the skill but also just reading the source code to level up their own security game.

So you end up with endpoints that check if you're logged in, but the actual data fetching has zero ownership verification. Classic IDOR setup.\n\nStarred the repo, the approach of encoding attacker knowledge into the skill rather than just defensive rules is the right way to think about it.",

      "text": "Found this fascinating deep-dive by a data analyst who managed to pull Claude's *exact* internal usage limits by analyzing unrounded floats in the web interface.\n\nThe math is insane. If you are using Claude for coding (especially with agents like Claude Code), you might be overpaying for the API by a factor of 30+.\n\n**The TL;DR:**\n\n1. **Subscription vs. API:** In a typical \"agentic\" loop (where the model reads the same context over and over), the subscription is **up to 36x better value** than the API.\n   * **Why?** Because on the web interface (Claude.ai), **cache reads are 100% free**. In the API, you pay 10% of the input cost every time. For long chats, the API eats your budget in minutes, while the subscription keeps going.\n2. **The \"Max 20x\" Trap:** Anthropic markets the higher tier as \"20x more usage,\" but the analyst found that this only applies to the 5-hour session limits.\n   * In reality, the **weekly** limit for the 20x plan is only **2x higher** than the 5x plan.\n   * Basically, the 20x plan lets you go \"faster,\" but not \"longer\" over the course of a week.\n3. **The \"Max 5x\" is the Hero:** This plan ($100/mo) is the most optimized.\n   * It gives you a **6x** higher session limit than Pro (not 5x as advertised).\n   * It gives you an **8.3x** higher weekly limit than Pro.\n   * It over-delivers on its promises, while the 20x tier under-delivers relative to its name.\n4. **How they found this:** They used the Stern-Brocot tree (fractional math) to reverse-engineer the \"suspiciously precise\" usage percentages (like `0.16327272727272726`) back into the original internal credit numbers.\n\n**Conclusion:** If you're a heavy user or dev, the $100 \"Max 5x\" plan is currently the best deal in AI.\n\nSource with full math and credit-to-token formulas: [she-llac.com/claude-limits](http://she-llac.com/claude-limits)",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 100 comments.**\n\nAlright folks, the consensus in this thread is a big 'hell yeah' to OP's number-crunching, but with a few giant asterisks.\n\n**The community largely agrees: the $100/mo \"Max 5x\" plan is the undisputed king of value for heavy users.** The math checks out—free cache reads on the web UI make it wildly cheaper than the API for long, agentic sessions. Many users on the 5x plan confirm they rarely hit their limits even with all-day use.\n\nHowever, the \"Max 20x is a trap\" claim has some nuance. The weekly limit is only 2x the 5x plan (for 2x the price), but the *5-hour session limit* is a whopping 4x higher. The verdict? **Max 20x is for 'sprinters' who need massive burst capacity, while Max 5x is for 'marathoners' who need sustained usage.**\n\nNow for the big 'but' that everyone's screaming about: **Anthropic has zero transparency.** These are reverse-engineered limits that could change tomorrow without a word. Use this info to optimize now, but don't bet your business on it long-term.\n\nHere are the key practical takeaways from the discussion:\n\n*   **Using Claude Code in VS Code?** Stop burning API credits! The official extension lets you log in with your `claude.ai` subscription. Several users were mind-blown by this.\n*   **Privacy Check:** Remember the API and web UI have different Terms of Service. The API is generally safer for sensitive/proprietary code.\n*   **The Contrarian Take:** A popular opinion is that limits are actually a *good* thing. They force you to become a more disciplined and efficient prompter instead of getting lazy with sloppy, token-gobbling prompts.",

There are days where I can burn through it in an hour, but normally I get about 60-80% into the usage before I am done for the window. \n\nThe API cost I expected to be more, because its the most dynamic. If someone needed it only for an hour a month, or in very high usage but infrequently, then it could be cheaper than alternative plans. But I think since adding Claude Code to the Teams plan, most orgs just give that out to rank and file and people can upgrade to Premium if needed. \n\nI think they really do have too many plans with way to many different styles, and should just start merging them into a pay-as-you-go with minimums that are higher offering cheaper token costs. The time windows and weekly limits feel constricting, but then paying for something you dont use feels wasteful. We have all the extremes with a complicated product breakdown that only a few of its users actually understand, we need a happy middle ground so new users and enterprise can just get the right thing from the start and pay the right price. \n\nAlso a separate management portal for the API has tripped up our org a few times. The admins of our Claude cant keep up with the technical details at all.",

The Entry Barrier: Team plans require a minimum of 5 seats. So, while the per-user cost might look comparable ($30/mo per user), you're looking at a $150/mo minimum commitment right out of the gate.\n2. Usage Caps: Team plans generally offer higher usage limits than the standard 'Pro' ($20) plan (usually around 2x-5x depending on demand), but they don't necessarily scale as aggressively as the Max 20x tier for an individual.\n3. The 'Admin' Edge: The real value of the Team plan isn't just tokens; it’s central billing, SSO, and 'Projects' with shared knowledge bases. For a dev team, the ability to share a 'Context' (documentation, style guides, common libraries) across 5 people is a massive multiplier that Individual plans don't offer.\n\nVerdict: If you are a solo dev, Max 5x is still the king of ROI. But if you have 4+ colleagues, the Team plan is better - not just for the limits, but for the shared context and organizational control.",

But there is a massive difference in 'reasoning depth' when you hit complex architectural problems.\n\nThe 'Context vs. Snippets' gap: > Copilot is great at the 'next line of code.' Claude Max (especially with Projects and massive context) is designed for 'the next 500 lines of logic across 10 files.' When you feed Claude a 100k+ token repo map, it can spot bugs and architectural flaws that a lighter model simply doesn't have the 'memory' to catch.\n\nThe 'Limit' factor: > Even 'Unlimited' plans like Copilot have hidden throttling or fallback to smaller models once you hit a certain threshold. With Claude Max, you are essentially paying for 'Reserved High-Performance Capacity.'\n\nVerdict: If you're building a simple app, Copilot is plenty. If you're refactoring a legacy enterprise monolith or designing a complex system from scratch, the $100 for Claude Max isn't a cost - it's an investment in a 'Senior Partner' rather than a 'Junior Assistant'.",

So right now 3 hours of deep work with multi agent orchestration makes me still 10x more productive (at least) than I was working a full day before AI coding tools was a thing.\n\nI honestly think the future is gonna be much more 1 man companies, where each of us have 5, 10 or 50 agents doing all sorts of work for our own businesses.

Local logs are perfect for tracking specific sessions.\n\nPersonally, I’m mostly using Claude as an agent directly in VS Code, so having this macro-level understanding of plan limits is crucial for my daily workflow.\n\nThe reason I found this analysis so valuable is that it explains the **'why'** behind the economy of web-plans vs API. While local stats show you what you've *spent*, this breakdown shows you how to *save* by picking the right tier for heavy agentic use.\n\nBoth combined give you the full picture.

For tools that are hardcoded to use Anthropic’s API keys only, there’s no way around it - you’re paying the 'API tax.'\n\nThat’s actually why I’ve shifted my workflow towards tools (like certain VS Code agents) that allow for 'Browser/Web' providers or MCP (Model Context Protocol). It lets you leverage that subscription 'arbitrage' while still having the power of an agent.\n\nBut yeah, if you're locked into an API-only environment like Moltbot, this math just serves as a painful reminder of what we're paying for convenience!",
