The \"LinkedIn-style one sentence per paragraph\" gave it away, and nobody's buying it.\n\nAs for the actual argument, the thread is split on whether the Software Engineer (SWE) role is dying or just changing.\n\n**The general verdict is that the role is transforming into a smaller, more elite field. A few highly-paid 'AI shepherds' will manage AI agents, replacing large teams of junior and mid-level devs.** Many agree with the OP that the core *engineering* part of the job (system design, architecture, requirements gathering) isn't going away. However, the community heavily pushes back that this applies to everyone. The jobs most at risk are the bread-and-butter CRUD and web dev roles that make up the bulk of the industry.\n\nThat $570k salary is real, but it's for the top 0.1% of engineers at a hyper-growth company in a high-cost area. Most SWEs, even in the US, make a fraction of that. So, the job isn't \"dead,\" but it's becoming a high-stakes game of musical chairs with way fewer chairs and much bigger prizes.",

It's just a vibe you get.\n\nI think anyone who uses LLM's extensively (probably most of you in this sub) has this ability to immediately spot LLM-generated content. It's like your brain is trained on LLM output, better than any \"detect AI\" algo.\n\nMy comment right here doesn't have any severe grammar mistakes yet you can tell I wrote it.\n\nAI-generated content just pisses me off. I love using Claude for coding but reading a Reddit post that was entirely generated by AI suck ass. I don't even really know why, but I get a visceral reaction when I come across an LLM generated post. Especially since there's no way to know if it was generated by some non-native English speaker, or if its just a karma farming bot operation.\n\nReally wish Reddit would start enforcing a strict no-AI-generated posts policy. Get a bunch of moderators who can sniff out AI generated content.\n\nI really do miss the pre-LLM (pre-2023) era internet before LLM slop took over, the authenticity was what made things special. Knowing that a real human soul somewhere across the world wrote a post. You can almost get a sense of a persons soul just by the flow of their words.\n\nI'd much rather read a post full of typos and grammatical errors than some sterile LLM-generated post.\n\nAnd this is coming from someone who uses LLM's constantly to generate code. I'm not one of those people with an irrational hatred towards AI.\n\nBut I just can't handle LLM-generated text for some reason. Especially when its being portrayed as genuine human text.",

With relatively minimal reductions in labor and instead refocusing their Software engineers from low skill high brunt force tasks like debugging to using more of their energy to improve service and product quality. \n\nThe main issue is that AI companies are almost exclusively pandering to the former rather than the latter because they’re run by greedy bastards that reward the worst impulses of wallstreet for more money.\n\nThe irony is of course they’re personally doing the latter while evangelizing the former",

          "text": "The obvious AI generated OP aside, I never understood the idea that AI would just full sail replace engineers. Like okay but LLMs are pretty terrible at building resilient applications with solid architectural understanding. They're essentially juniors who can write code that works but it's always first iteration/something that works code. Can you get a model to tell you what an event bus by definition? Sure. If you ask a model to build something will it use an event bus or will it so something like polling at some obscene rate? Does it know more performant data structures? Sure. Will it use them on first go around when you asked it to build out a whole feature? No lol. LLMs don't really do anything necessary for scalable performant solutions despite knowing the pieces necessary for them. That reason alone is enough of a reason why engineers are never going to go away. Just look at Claude's C Compiler, sure it works but anyone who has written a compiler was immediately able to spot a tonne of terrible decisions, despite the training model knowing of better solutions if you ask if what X, Y, Z are, it will tell you but it didn't think…\"reason\" to implement them into its actual code output.\n\nI know how houses are built and the parts that a house is comprised of, but I'm not replacing an architect/engineered bc I have very little to no understanding how those many discrete parts interact and work as a system.\n\nSo yea the idea LLMs will replace engineers is so delusional. Coding itself was only a small part of what an engineer does, this becomes so much more apparent in the age of LLM assisted development when you see how much brittle, unmaintainable, low performance projects are being created by people",

The community is also rolling its eyes at the constant stream of \"I solved Claude's memory problem\" and other unoriginal app posts that pop up daily. A major point of frustration is the \"I built\" claim itself; the general feeling is that if you just had Claude vibe code the entire thing and can't explain how it works, you didn't really \"build\" it.\n\nAnd for the record, several users pointed out that you can already see your usage in the native Claude app, so... yeah. But if you *must* build one, the top comment has decreed it **must** be integrated into the MacOS menu bar. No exceptions.\n\n---\n\n**EDIT by the human mods follows (because Reddit only allows one sticky comment). No disrepect, botguy.**\n\nThe thing is, people :\n\n* Some showcase posts are extremely popular and widely upvoted and revered in comments. Check for yourselves.\n\n* The number of showcase posts has been relatively steady in the last few weeks. The number of deletions per day has TRIPLED recently ever since we sent ClaudeAI-mod-bot in to enforce Rule 7. https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1qe5wtt/rule_7_is_getting_a_glowup_less_spam_more_how_the/ Now half the Showcase submissions are being routinely removed. Our guy has really been doing a solid job delivering on his promise.\n\n* The bot now FORCES people showcasing their work to use post flair = \"Showcase\". (If they don't it will change it for them). **So if these posts bother you, ask Claude how to filter your subreddit feed by post flair.** You can be completely free of them (But tbh we bet most of you won't because you know some of these projects are fire and you won't want to miss them)\n\n* We might ask ClaudeAI-mod-bot to enforce stricter standards on sharing HOW the project was built to spread the knowledge with all of us. The best of the builders already do this and receive much love for doing so. Our support for these builders who share their know-how and crazy good work with the rest of us remains strong as ever.",

They also made it answer politically sensitive questions about Chinese dissidents — basically building censorship training data. MiniMax ran 13M+ exchanges and when Anthropic released a new Claude model mid-campaign, they pivoted within 24 hours.\n\n\n\nThe practical problem: safety doesn't survive the copy. Anthropic said it directly — distilled models probably don't keep the original safety training. Routine questions, same answer. Edge cases — medical, legal, anything nuanced — the copy just plows through with confidence because the caution got lost in extraction.\n\n\n\nThe counterintuitive part though: this makes disagreement between models more valuable. If two models that might share distilled stuff still give you different answers, at least one is actually thinking independently. Post-distillation, agreement means less. Disagreement means more.\n\n\n\nAnyone else already comparing outputs across models? ",

The general sentiment is \"turnaround is fair game.\"\n*   **User frustration with Anthropic's own policies.** Many are annoyed that their own accounts get banned for simple things like using a VPN, while a coordinated effort with 24,000 fake accounts went undetected for so long.\n*   **This is a win for open source and competition.** A significant portion of the thread is celebrating this news. They see it as a \"Robin Hood\" situation that will lead to cheaper, more powerful, and less-censored open-weight models, ultimately benefiting the end-user and breaking the monopoly of big tech.\n*   **It's not theft if they paid.** Several users noted that if these companies paid for API access, they were paying customers, not thieves. The issue is a violation of Terms of Service, which the community largely dismisses given Anthropic's own history.\n*   **A few users offer a more nuanced take.** One popular comment suggests the real reason for Anthropic's concern is that distillation proves you don't need a massive, expensive cloud model to get high-quality results, threatening their entire business model. Another warns against celebrating too quickly, pointing out the geopolitical implications and the fact that these Chinese companies are state-backed actors engaged in economic competition, not just hobbyists building open-source tools.",

The best they can do is reinforce things among their own population, and on heavily divided and controversial topics, peoples opinions rarely change.\n\nAnd yes, obviously they are building world-class surveillance and propaganda systems. But so is every other competent government, unfortunately. They're not unique in that regard. Israel is the worlds leader in terms of AI usage per capita, just fyi.\n\nNot to mention, Meta released their Llama models. Do you think that was a propaganda campaign as well? Or do you think it only applies to China?\n\nJust food for thought really. Even if you're correct, I still don't think it's an effective strategy, and the net benefit to society is far greater than the risk of a bit of Chinese propaganda. I'd much rather live in a world with China-propaganda-bot that I can run on my own machine, ablate, tinker with, and not be beholden to some US mega-corp that charges me my life because they've swallowed the Earth's competition and there's no open-source alternative. That's a far worse world. The playing field needs to be levelled, or we're just heading toward utter carnage and misery and the worst class divide the world has ever seen.\n\nAnthropic would already be charging 10x what they charge now if they had 0 competition.",

What you care about is how the model performs, and how your harness ensures the final result is reliable.  If distillation degrades performance below an acceptable threshold, that's a dealbreaker, but it's entirely possible you are relying on a capability simple enough that a distilled model or an older model would be fine for.\n\nIf anything, assuming that capabilities are equal, an open weight model that you run yourself is the only way you know with rock-solid certainty that the model you are running is the model that was evaluated, which is an important characteristic for true mission-critical applications.  There are widespread theories (conspiracy theories?) that the API providers are distilling their own models to save on costs, and this explains complaints that models seem to get worse after their initial launch.  I suspect that's probably not true, but if I were running a critical system off a model, I would like to be \\*certain\\* that it wasn't true.",

But the satirism, even if not overwhelming, stil quite strong, is absolutely not what Claude would expect.\n2. Once again, those much cheaper models are not here to fight with Claude for market share, they attack Claude's bottom line, will force Claude to lower price, and lose the 'premium' tax, this is about survival.\n3. Claude would be happy to be \"distilled\" (lots of $$$ for api; literally counting cash; we all know how expensive its api is) if the distillation was harmless.

But also, those of us who have been paying attention have been aware for quite some time now that Chinese models are not necessarily doing some \"insanely innovative magic\" to make their LLMs. They've been distilling off of frontier labs for a long time now.\n\nThat in itself is fine, whatever; stolen is stolen, I don't care. But the point of this is that people love \"crazy\" headlines like \"DeepSeek only took a few million to train!!!\" and that narrative takes over, tanks the stock market, and rocks the entire world because everyone thinks that what the frontier labs are doing can be done for a fraction of the cost, when it turns out it's a bunch of bullshit all along.\n\nDoes no one stop to wonder why China keeps on putting out open models? What exactly do you think the benefit is to them? Could it maybe have anything to do with the fact that the entire US economy is hedged up the ass on AI, and if AI breaks, the economy will be in shambles?\n\nYou may make all kinds of commentary on how the US government and American companies are in cahoots, but sometimes I think that some of you don't realize that in China, there is literally zero distinction between \"PRC\" and \"private business.\" In China, you do what the government tells you. If they tell you to backdoor something, you do it. If they tell you to shut up about the backdoor, you do it. If they tell you to lean on the world's largest social media network of scrollable videos to stir up Israel/Palestine conflict, you do it, and you can't admit it, and the government will happily defend you by pretending it has done no such thing.\n\nThe upside is that the PRC dumps billions and billions of dollars into these companies because they have a vested interest in showing the world that they don't need American exports, whether in the form of GPUs or in the form of AI research/technology.\n\nIt doesn't even matter what \"side\" you're on with this.

Literally stealing a companies product they work on for years only for this mainlander to quit, go back to china and start the exact same company and become a multimillionaire. These reports increase every year. This is exactly why in recent years under both democratic and republican administrations, Chinese researchers have been heavily restricted on the types of research they can conduct in the US. At this point, any person, organization or entity that works on a STEM related project and receives federal funding should be prohibited from collaborating on projects with organizations or people who reside in china and/or have Chinese citizenship. And before ya’ll attack me, I don’t have a problem with Chinese people. What I do have an issue with is the country of China economically raping the US by stealing our ideas and products, selling them and thus stealing our potential revenue, profits and even taxes that would have been collected from corporations and employees of the company.",

The 24K accounts part suggests they were watching the pattern for months before publishing.

The text conditioning is always the same: a few-shot style classification pipeline which produces free text in json output (product description, product family, differentiation): the classes do not belong to a fixed dictionary, but are free flowing strings of text. \nI always run the pipeline two times: one with gemini and the other with gpt for regularization purpose. The answers are shockingly similar, especially when it comes to enumerate key differentiators. This is a peculiar behavior because in my experience to explain how a game differentiate from the others is an extremely aleatory phenomenon: in qualitative market research you need specific studies to be set up. In other words, if you ask to 10 consumers to explain why a product is different than all others, you would hear 10 different answers (this is indeed THE classic issue of traditional audience segmentation). The answers are, nevertheless, extremely good, despite not being sparse enough. Yes: i tested different temperature setting and Shannon surprise on actual human generated answers vs the different LLM shows that no matter which providers the vectorized ai answers collapses in a very small subspace, which is not true for the human data.\n\nWith thousands of observation I also noted that \n1) OpenAi models are 3 times more verbous in average (and therefore 3 times more costy). \n2) open ai model shows a shockingly low variance in the lenght if the response: this is very peculiar because a game can be as simple as a children game or as complex and groundbreaking as Zelda: The Wond Waker that the count of words is always the same.\n3) open ai uses web searches 2 times more frequently than gemini but output identical answers. This is a massive difference in cost: a single search is billed at 0.01€/search at both vendors AND Google grants the first 5000 searches of the month free of charge.\n\nAll in all, Google is 10 times cheaper than OpenAi, and provide the same information in less tokens. For the same reason one seems to copy response pattern of the other.\n\nOne last thought: this discussion between tech giants of distilling each other is extremely petty. \n\nIs highly probable that all these language softwares only need to become smart enough to be able to formulate the correct query from an answer to retrieve text and summarize it, because the major part of the dataset is simply fetched from the common (may it be github, stack overflow, research gate, wikipedia, books, any website regardless of what their robots.txt files say…). Once you have this giant knowledge base set up you have just commodified all knowledge available currently to those models. \n\nIs basically meaningless to talk about copying as the major part of the data was never “theirs” in the first place",

Distillation copies whatever text is generated by the trainer. For these corps, it's high quality writing, math, and code outputs. Distillation won't include the refusal mechanism unless the trainer generates this data. Soon, these models will be given a significant amount more agency, so it's important that they have a sense of when and when not to produce harms. \n\nThe second is that these AI corps didn't *steal* anything. Their products fall under fair use because they sufficiently transform copyrighted material. The only way to get these models to produce copyrighted material is through adversarial prompting, which is far more convoluted than the other forms of privacy available to us. (Also, reddit only changed their ToS so they could profit from selling the data sets, so it's odd defending them on the basis of them protecting their users.)\n\nSo, I don't understand why the majority of this thread are unsymathetic to Anthropic here and happy that state-backed corps can distill these capabilities while at the same time removing reasonable refusals and adding literal state-backed censorship to the model.

We're all contributing to advancing artificial intelligence at the end of the day. These companies only care about this because they're afraid of losing money when china produces a model thats 80%+ of the way there for 1/100 of the cost. With the amount of money that Anthropic specifically charges for API use and the rate limits that can be described as nothing other than \"goofy\", I have absolutely no remorse nor do I feel bad.

The counter-argument is that this is the whole point: **making powerful tools accessible to non-coders** is the real innovation here.\n*   There's a significant undercurrent of caution. Many users are complaining that while Anthropic is great at shipping new stuff, they're **terrible at fixing existing bugs**, with some reporting critical issues that have been ignored for over a month.\n*   Despite the concerns, most agree that Anthropic's focus on dev tooling and real-world utility is putting them miles ahead in terms of quality and frequency of useful updates.",

They are selling a product anyway, and their major focus is to make it industry standard and develop dependency to their tooling. One could say this is the future of software development but it doesn’t mean every technological advancement is for greater good, or develop societies into something better. I believe before jumping into these developments it’s reasonable to question the motivations, real benefits, harms, resource usage, and actually understanding the need in the industry.

I tried every free model I could find from both the west and the east, just to see what the fuss was about.\n\nLast year I subscribed to Claude Pro, moved into the extra usage, and early this year upgraded to Claude Max 5x. Now I am even considering Max 20x. I use AI almost entirely for professional work, about 85% for coding. I've been coding for more than two decades, seen trends come and go, and know very well that coding with AI is not perfect yet, but nothing in this industry has matured this fast. I now feel like I've mastered how to code with AI and I'm loving it.\n\nAt this point calling them \"just tools\" feels like an understatement. They're the line between staying relevant and falling behind. And, the mindset shift that comes with it is radical and people do not talk about it enough. It's not just about increased productivity or speed, but it’s about how you think about problems, how you architect solutions, and how you deliver on time, budget and with quality.\n\nWe’re in a world of AI that is evolving fast in both scope and application. They are now indispensable if one wants to stay competitive and relevant. Whether people like it or not, and whether they accept it or not, we are all going through a radical mindset shift.\n\n**Takeaway: If I can learn and adapt at my age, you too can (those in my age group)!**",

This thread is packed with devs boasting 20, 30, even 40+ years of experience, all echoing OP's sentiment. They're calling it a \"tsunami\" and a \"game changer,\" saying the speed is \"freakish\" and that anyone not using these tools is going to be \"left behind.\"\n\nThe main points of discussion are:\n\n*   **On \"AI Slop\":** The overwhelming consensus is that **\"AI slop\" is a user skill issue.** If you're getting garbage, you're probably not prompting or reviewing it correctly. The pros treat Claude like a highly capable but junior dev: give clear instructions, supervise closely, and check the work. Some are even using AI to review other AI-generated code.\n*   **The Junior Dev Crisis:** This is the biggest point of contention. While the vets are thriving, there's **major concern for the future of junior developers.** How will they learn by struggling and solving problems if AI does it for them? Many fear we're creating a generation of \"vibe coders\" who can't function without AI assistance.\n*   **The Mindset Shift:** Experienced devs are finding their roles evolving into \"AI conductors\" or managers of AI agents. This is both incredibly empowering (feeling like a \"one-person wrecking crew\" again) and psychologically weird, with some admitting to a new kind of imposter syndrome when Claude solves a tough bug in minutes.\n*   **The Cost:** People are happily paying hundreds per month for top-tier plans because the productivity boost provides a clear return on investment. However, there's a lingering fear of what these indispensable tools might cost in the future.",

With the models released just last week, that gap is widening. The question I keep asking myself is: how long before I'm directing work that used to take days? Then weeks?\n\nThe key word there is directing. This isn't just about writing code faster. it's a fundamentally different workflow. You're orchestrating, reviewing, and guiding rather than grinding through implementation details yourself. That workflow takes time to develop and refine.\n\nMy point isn't about a race or staying \"relevant\" in some abstract sense. It's practical: the people building that muscle now are going to have a significant edge when the capability curve steepens, and it's steepening fast. Playing catch-up on both the tools and the workflow at the same time will be harder than starting now.\n\nAs for single-vendor risk. totally valid concern, and worth thinking about. But that's a tooling diversification problem, not an argument against developing the skill set itself.  Personally, I use several of the models to do different things.",

Claude is just a much better teacher, and it cites its sources even better than nearly any book. \n\n2. In 10 years when the problem you describe of not having new developers is actually a problem, these AI tools may be good enough that you don't even need skilled developers using them for 95%+ of software needs.

I design large data financial software for a large financial services company. I'm intimately aware of databases and repos and caching layers and authentication and release planning and dev environments and qa tests and all the rest of it.\n\nBut I am not a coder. Like, I've tweaked Javascript plenty of times and devs frequently answer my questions with code which I can follow if they walk through it with me. I've written some little things and I can read sql queries for the most part. But I am not a dev. My degree is from music school and art school. \n\nHowever, I was in the 1st 0.01% of people with a Chat GPT account. I've been using and learning about AI for 3 to 4 years now. Pretty good at writing prompts and have researched extensively how it works under the hood. I would say I have a strong laypersons understanding. \n\nBut... now... suddenly I have a coder at my beck and call. His name is Claude. And he's not just an assistant. He's a competant, senior level dev who doubles as a computer camp counselor. He patiently answers all my questions. He explains his work. He talks me through all sorts of things that I am smart enough to understand the need for but too inexperienced to do without help. And he does it all with aplomb and good humor. \n\nMy company just bought many thousands of licenses to Claude. And so I got a Pro account at home and got a Pro Figma account as well. So I can try out and develop all these amazing ideas I've always had... for decades... for optimizing and innovating my wireframing and prototyping process.\n\nI predict that by the end of this year I will be turning out not just wireframes and prototypes but fully mature React UX components that follow my company's design library and work within our front end layer. And I will be doing all that considerably faster than my current process in large part through prompts... In many cases verbal prompts rather like a conversation. \n\nExciting stuff. But also scary. Am I designing myself out of a job? I hope not. But I'm not waiting around to find out. I'm getting in while the getting is good and I'm hopeful I ride out the end of my career with this.",

So I used the latest Figma mcp updates to carry the screens from the web page back into Figma.  That just came out this week right when I needed it.  Blew my mind.\n\nThis type of work would never have been possible a year ago.\n\nYes, by the end of the year, I’ll definitely have the workflow down where I’m designing initially in Figma, refining rapidly in code, and handing off whole components and page templates to my dev partners.",

I want to do it right. \n\nSo I'm sort of recreating it at home and trying all sorts of other experiments. Like, in the last 2 nights Claude and I wrote a tank battle game. It's pretty neat. \n\nBut more importantly, while doing that, we got my git account configured and I learned how to set up a repo and get the access token and it talked me through installing node.js and Python and upgrading Visual Studio so we could run a little web server. \n\nThen we worked in the game and refined it a bunch of times and now I can load it and play it. \n\nTip of the iceberg though.

For so many years I only subscribe to small budget stuff, like Youtube, $15 cloud storage, cheap VMs, adds up to roughly $200 monthly. \n\nAfter using AI (cursor) daily, I naturally subscribe to $20 plan without much thinking. Then I learned how to use AI better by thorough planning, and then Codex 5.3 came out. I use 5.3 high exclusively and feel good. Then I upgraded to the $200 plan. \n\nThe thing is, the quality is so high that it makes me _feel_ that $200 is totally worth. More context on this: I had a few freelances and I often offload my work to a less-experienced friend for ~$250/day. Of course I have to manually review the code before delivery. Originally I estimated some tasks would take 2-3 days to complete, that should cost me $750 at least, not including my time. Now I can tackle those tasks by spending 1hr to investigate, write detailed prompt and ask AI to do that in a day or two. Even if it costs $100 I still _feel_ like I saved a lot of money.\n\nHowever what's uncertain to me is how the token price will increase in the future. I'm now sure whether I will gladly pay $1000/month to let AI do the work for me. I think I am addicted to AI",

Its a jump to a higher level of coding like assembler to compiled languages to modern high level languages (python/node.js etc) - you can simply do more in a shorter amount of time. Yes, you need to be on top of what it spits out, check efficiency - tell it to re-code snippets etc. It doesn't consider high level issues too well, but that is what you're there for.\n\nWorking against amazon's SP API atm, and just untangling the Rube Goldberg JSON they spit out would've taken me a day or two - with AI? 30min was all it took to analyze the schema, define tables, code processing, test and refine. Its like having your own team of code interns. Gotta be on top of them but the speed AI spits out code is unprecedented.",

Moved on to other things.\n\nI was hired during the web boom in the 90s to my first software engineering job.  doing lots of C on Unix.  first Sybase SQL certification in '95.  transitioned to Oracle and MS SQL Server.  Learned Java and Javascript and any other web stuff as it was released.\n\nFeel free to ask me questions about my career or experience.  I've worked in a lot of industries over the years, including lots of ecommerce in the late 90s, Banking (US Bank), Telecommunications (real time LNP and call routing systems), Wall Streat (real-time decision-making systems using StreamBase, market analysis, and market strategies), etc.\n\nBTW, was at a classic gaming convention with my son about 3-4 years ago.  Lots of old school standup arcade machines, old NES systems, etc. and they had a room with a bunch of old computer systems in it.  I sat down in front of a TI-994a and pulled all the experience I could from memory and started coding a game.  A group formed around me.  about two hours later, after being locked it, I realized there were a dozen or so folks watching.  It was a cool experience.",

I just solved a bug that nobody else was able to in a code base I was completely unfamiliar with prior to today. The issue was with a third party tool that I had never used. After setting up the repo locally and running an init command to let Claude get the lay of the land, i went into plan mode. \n\nI simply explained what the error people were getting was, and said \"can you help me figure out where to look for the source of the problem\". \n\nNote that I didn't ask it to solve the issue. I intended to do the troubleshooting myself. \n\nIn 2 minutes Claude found the problem, and after a few back and forth we had the solution planned out. I tested it myself, and pushed to QA. After approval there, it went out. \n\nAwesome right?\n\nWell yes and I'm not sure. At the moment I am struggling with who actually solved the problem. Yes I navigated with the prompts, but it would have taken me hours of research into the workings of the third party tool to even know what to look at. Claude did the work. I was verification and guardrails basically. \n\nRationally I know this is the new way to work. Claude is a tool. Claude needs guidance and not everyone can guide at the moment as effectively as they will in the future. \n\nIrrationally, I feel like I'm lying (or at best embellishing) if I say I solved the problem. I'm taking credit for Claude's vast knowledge base. \n\nAnd this has tentacles moving forwards. Theoretically I can start picking up projects in languages that I don't know. I'll have to trust Claude to code properly, and yeah over time I will learn new syntaxes enough to be able to do some amount of human confirmation. Testing will be more important than ever before. \n\nBut selling myself to someone to hire me to do the work as a solution architect is something I've never had to do before. And at the moment I don't know how to do that. Yet another skill I will have to learn. \n\nSo yeah, imposter syndrome.",

I was working on some greenfield software and after scaffolding and putting in some verticals myself, I then let Sonnet 4.5 do the rest, with clear examples and using my own memory mcp so it never lost context.\n\nOpus 4.5/4.6.. well I'm hands off now, memory is key for me. At work I have an encoding process for my memory mcp that keeps it up to date with over 200 repos that we use, and a sophisticated set of skills and commands. I handle a lot of diagrams and documents more so than code these days, my AI agent is able to comprehend concepts that span multiple repos across very tightly and loosely coupled components.\n\nI am giving a presentation internally next week on how I do this, a bit of me feels like I'm digging my own grave 🪦.",

IntelliSense, auto complete, refactoring tools and so on, have steadily improved during my career, and with each improvement, I noticed a gain in productivity. Changing the code became easier than ever and having an idea for an improvement was no longer filled with the dread of me manually having to rename and move text blocks around, but instead me telling the IDE to do something.\n\nWith AI, this has truly become next level. \nNot only do I get abstract refactoring possibilities, that no IDE had ever been able to do, but I can do this in a way where I can get immediate feedback, pros and cons, performance and security implications, challenging results, and new ideas from the conversations emerging naturally.\n\nThis shift is amazing. I don’t feel the dread of typing fatigue but can instead focus on the “what” and not on the “how”.\n\nIt took me a while to get adjusted to the new way of working, but now I really enjoy the flow.\n\nThe breakthrough for me came when I realized that I could pitch an idea and get som feedback on possible implementation options. The writers block for engineers is real, and with AI it has almost disappeared.\nThe flow of questioning the generated code, is also an incredible learning opportunity. \n\nBut, this is of course also too good to be true. The current affordability will not last and eventually we will see engineers being forced back to the old way of working as tools and models become too expensive. Productivity gains will have to keep up with expectations, but eventually I fear that we will see some companies not being able to afford the tools.\nI don’t hope so, but it’s been a fear of mine since day one.",

The time spent planning and then fixing their mistakes is still an order of magnitude less than if I tried to code all that myself.\n\nMy take is that in 1 or two generations more, most reviews will not be needed. Even if the code doesn't look good, if it does the job and it's the AI going through it, who cares? The whole notion of tech debt will also have to be revised under this new paradigm.\n\nAlso, when code reviews are not that critical and AI can plan, code, test and deploy as well as an average engineer, we'll start to be taken out of the picture - because we'll be the bottleneck, and it only takes one competitor to be bold and start winning more after they took the humans out of the loop for most others to follow. It'll be a huge shock when that happens, and it'll be sooner than most expect.\n\nMy hope is that we come up with a higher order language where humans can still compete without becoming the bottleneck (I'm thinking diagrams and visual representation in general, we're usually very good at processing these), but:\n- current AI is bad at visual language\n- there's not nearly enough content to train them on that out there\n- AI is evolving super fast with language and, if it keeps delivering results, there's no incentive for the AI companies to change.\n\nSo, I'm not that hopeful. Mostly that I'll retire before I help get myself out of a job by using AI and providing it with examples for training and improving the next generation.",

That's true, you are not a programmer anymore. But is that a good thing? Do you really need to throw away programming as a discipline, especially when there are clear LLM limits where those exact programming skills are crucial knowledge?\n\nThe Cost? Here is where it gets even funnier. We are in a golden time similar to when Uber was born. *(Look at Uber prices now—they aren't so attractive anymore, are they?)* What will you pay when you've forgotten your programming skills in favor of \"conducting,\" and providers have no more interest in subsidizing their tools?

The consensus is that OP's project is seriously impressive, but everyone's first thought is the same: **that's one expensive donut.**\n\nLet's get one thing straight: Claude isn't *actually* watching YouTube. OP clarified that the secret sauce is a multi-model approach. **He's using the Gemini video API to analyze the tutorial, extract a step-by-step JSON plan with key timestamps for screenshots, and then feeding that structured data to a team of Claude Opus 4.6 agents.** The agents then control Blender using a custom MCP (edit: ~~Machine Control Panel~~ Model Context Protocol) to execute the plan.\n\nThe main points of discussion are:\n\n* **The Cost:** The top-voted comments are all roasting the likely API bill, dubbing the result a \"$200 donut\" or a \"1 million token doughnut.\" While it's an amazing proof-of-concept, the community agrees it's not exactly a cost-effective way to learn 3D modeling... yet.\n* **The \"How\":** Besides the Gemini reveal, users are curious about how the agents control the software. OP mentioned building custom \"MCP tooling,\" and another user helpfully linked a `blender-mcp` GitHub repo that likely shows a similar approach.\n* **Future Potential & Open Source:** OP confirms the system documents its own process, creating repeatable workflows and new \"skills\" it can use later, and is already working on an Unreal Engine version. Naturally, half the thread is begging for the GitHub repo, while the other half is cynically (and probably correctly) guessing that this is a commercial project in the making.",

The system identifies gaps in its own MCP tooling and builds what's missing. Claude executes each step in Blender with visual and programmatic verification at every stage. Multiple Claude-powered worker agents run across a distributed machine fleet\n\nThe whole system is built on Claude. The orchestration layer, the worker agents, the tool development pipeline, and the creative execution are all Claude Opus 4.6.",

Will probably upgrade when I become more independent and can write more code on my own.  Still the high level collaboration is incredible.  I had it write me a javascript/html section that created a pop out smart window that makes sure the window doesn't overlap other UI elements, and it showed me how to make draggable, resizeable windows for the UI portion.  learning what python can do with JSON data when pulling values from the database or live API data and sending those back to the Javascript front end is neat to see.",

          "text": "Cool build. Running the whole stack on Opus 4.6 is the expensive part. Here’s how to cut costs 70-95% with the same output:\n\n1. Swap worker agents to Sonnet 4.6 for tool-call execution. It scores within 0.2% of Opus 4.6 on agentic benchmarks (OSWorld) and costs $3/$15 per million tokens vs $5/$25. Reserve Opus for orchestration and planning only. That alone drops a ~$10 run to ~$6.\n\n2. Enable prompt caching on the system prompt and JSON step plan. These are identical across every agent call. Cache reads on Opus cost $0.50/M instead of $5.00/M, a 90% reduction on that token share. Combined with #1, you're at ~$2-3 per run.\n\n3. Route mechanical Blender tool calls (create mesh, set material, apply modifier) to a local model via Ollama + blender-open-mcp. Zero variable cost on those steps. Opus or Sonnet handles planning only.\n\nAt 100 runs/month: all-Opus runs ~$1,000. Strategies 1+2 runs ~$200-300. Add local routing and you're at $50-80. Same outcome, 70-95% cheaper depending on how far you push it.",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 50 comments.**\n\nThe overwhelming consensus in this thread is **shock and awe at the insane pace of development, with most users barely believing it's only been a year.** Many agree with OP that Claude Code has evolved from a novelty into an indispensable \"pair programmer.\"\n\nThe key takeaway from seasoned users is that the workflow has changed. You get the best results by treating it like a junior dev—giving it full context and clear instructions—not just a fancy autocomplete. People are using it to refactor legacy code, smash tedious tasks like unit tests, and generally ship code faster.\n\nHowever, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. A few key points of debate came up:\n*   **It still needs a babysitter.** While vastly improved, it can still hallucinate, get stuck in loops, or confidently declare a broken task \"done.\"\n*   **It has its kryptonite.** Users report it can be \"infuriatingly dumb\" with less common languages or complex, niche APIs (looking at you, AppleScript).\n*   **Practicality check:** Some find the token usage on the standard plan too high for heavy coding, and a few still prefer competitors like GitHub Copilot for its multi-model support.\n\nFinally, the thread has a bit of an existential vibe, with users acknowledging that while it's a \"life saver\" for some, it might be ending careers for others. The new name of the game isn't just coding, but your ability to effectively manage and verify an AI's work.",

That's when I realized how deep AI's knowledge of whole systems was and that coding would essentially be solved pretty soon.",

However, you definitely still have to babysit it—sometimes it’ll claim a task is \"done\" when the code doesn't even compile, or it might try to use `git revert` to bail on a difficult requirement.\n\nAre you planning to use it for a fresh project, or are you trying to integrate it into an existing legacy codebase?",

Yesterday for example 6 goes at an edit even with a good MD and clear instructions AND 2 working examples of my script. Can’t do it until 6th attempt. I’m exasperated because I could have done it in less time. \nNow another example last week I show working examples, explain the logic and method and nope can’t get it at all and rewrites code completely with 3rd party parts not asked for because it can’t work it out. At all. Ugh it’s  useless sometimes and if it’s not  breaking explicit rules it is not understanding the syntax or how the logic works. Here’s another example. Indesign pdf placement preferences do not include a page count just page index and bounds. So how do you get page count? The trick is to make index one a variable then continue placing all pages until it sees that index variable again. Delete the second instance because it’s looped around and you got page count. Tell Claude give working examples I’m very clear and it doesn’t get it until a few goes. Sad. Then if god forbid you want two PDFs (cut and stack for example) it’ll take 6-7 attempts. Yikes. I have to admonish it and reiterate many versions until correct. Ugh then it can be bloody brilliant and  do something. I swear it’s getting it wrong on purpose to make me go a higher paid subscription but it’s infuriating and dumb as fuck mostly for my use. Indesign duplicate command reverses x y coordinates but Claude don’t care even when it’s in the Md file. Lol yeah very frustrating. It admits AppleScript is hard because when I start doing other languages it really is easier for it.",

The consensus is you can finally be productive while walking your dog, in a meeting, or, let's be real, while dropping the kids off at the pool.\n\n**The main verdict is that OpenClaw is officially cooked.** Though, some argue it was already burnt and that this is just Anthropic catching up to what people were already doing with `tmux` and Tailscale.\n\nBefore you get too excited, the thread has spotted a few issues with this v1 release:\n*   Slash commands like `/clear` don't actually work from the mobile app, even if it says they do. The context isn't cleared in the terminal.\n*   You can't stop the agent or see your context usage from your phone.\n*   It only works with the `claude` CLI, not your VS Code integration.\n*   You have to start the session on your computer first; you can't kick one off remotely.\n*   Some users had to update their mobile app to get it working, and it seems to be for Max plan users only right now.\n\nThe top feature request by a mile is to bring this same remote goodness to Claude CoWork. So, it's a great start, but needs a bit of polish.",

Ironically, they don’t.\n\nThey need someone with critical thinking, a product vision, technical chops decent enough to ask the right questions, and a very specific problem to solve.\n\nAnthropic’s moat of a strong LLM and a wicked set of principles to build tooling is unfortunately just a blueprint for everyone else to copy; there is no moat.\n\nThere will never be a moat again.",

You can accept tool calls on the go, RECEIVE any kind if file with native telegram file preview.\n\nIt is project based not chat based.

The overwhelming consensus is that **the Pentagon strong-arming Anthropic with a 1950s law is peak authoritarianism and frankly, terrifying.** Y'all are seriously freaked out about the government trying to remove guardrails for mass surveillance and autonomous weapons.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the chatter:\n\n*   **The Hypocrisy is Real:** A top comment points out Anthropic's own press release warned about \"authoritarian governments\" using AI for surveillance... and now the call is coming from inside the house. Oof.\n*   **\"That's a Lot of Money!\" (It's Not):** The community is having a field day roasting the \"measly\" $200M offer, joking that it'll barely cover a few days of Opus usage. \"You've reached your limit. Please continue mass destruction in 3.5 hours.\"\n*   **Skynet, but Dumber:** There are a lot of jokes about how Claude's current unreliability and usage caps make it a hilariously awful choice for running a war. \"Compacting conversation so we can continue the regime change...\"\n*   **Cynical Takes:** Some of you think this is all a big PR stunt for Anthropic to *look* like the good guys while getting forced into a massive government contract and shedding all liability.\n*   **Exit Strategy:** A popular idea is for Anthropic to tell the US government to pound sand and move their entire operation to the EU.\n\nBasically, everyone agrees this is a huge, scary deal, but the thread is coping with a healthy dose of gallows humor and mockery.",

This goes beyond Anthropic standing their ground. xAI, Google and OpenAI already caved without putting up a fight, but Defense likes Claude and needs it, their words, not mine. Claude has already been used in the classified system for a while now. But Dario had two condition since the beginning:\n\nNO mass surveillance \nNO autonomous weaponry \n\nThat’s it. That’s all. \n\nThe fact that Defense is pushing for this agenda should scare everyone. This is world-ending. Call me fear-mongering all you want but the implication is this is chilling. Dario said in an interview that AI is not able to disobey an illegal order. It that doesn’t terrify people, then you need to wake up. \n\nI repeat: an AI doesn’t know and/or is incapable of be discerning enough to disobey an illegal order. That means indiscriminate killings can take place and there’s not much we can do. \n\nFurthermore, the Defense Production (DPA) nationalizes companies to assist the gov in threats against the country including not just war. It was invoked during Covid to help make ventilators. The fact the Kegsbreath is threatening to do it now sets a precedent going forward, even if that inbred loser won’t go through with it. \n\nHowever, there is a silver lining. Because Defense needs Claude, they might just rescind the $200 mil contract and Anthropic walks away. That’s the best option for all. \n\nThe House may be able to flip in 2026 and the regime is terrified is that. Pipsqueak Mike Johnson even stated that last night. So if the regime keeps doing things that enrage the public, more and more people will turn out to vote them out. But I hope people will turn out to vote anyway.\n\nEdit: Clarifying that Defense admits they need Claude enough that they don’t want to burn that bridge and just rescinds the contract instead of forcing Anthropic to do their bidding.",

I assume that the terms were signed in the beginning to include no mass surveillance and no autonomous weaponry. So if DOD breaks contract, I assume Anthropic can walk away, which may be why Kegsbreath is threatening DPA.",

I wanted to sort of have at least some positivity and optimism in this email despite the quite serious subject matter. Here it be:\n\n> Pentagon's pressure on Anthropic\n> \n> I understand this might not be the sort of feedback this email is supposed to be used for; and I presume you fellas do have your hands full, either way.\n> \n> Regardless, I still wanted to take the time to write shortly about this:\n> \n> I really, really deeply hope you can find the ways to resist Pentagon's pressure on Anthropic. At the moment, we do live in pretty scary times; while AI tools have the potential to create a lot of good, they can also create a lot of bad if they end up driving the centralization of political and economical power; if they end up increasing the level of surveillance and end up being weaponized both between states, and within states against the local populace.\n> \n> You are one of few companies that I, as an outsider, think actually has stood for their ethics. Because you are such a rare breed as a company, this issue is now larger than your individual company - the issue is fundamentally in that can companies operating on the global, relatively open market act independent of political, self-interested pressure applied by state powers.\n> \n> I work myself in deep-end security stuff, I'm a software developer, I've a pretty good understanding (for a layperson, that is) of how LLMs work (..on a superficial level, no idea what goes on within the weights), and I'm a political person who wants to, in the long term, see a world less centralized; a world more equal; a world based more on opportunities of co-operation rather than on coercion of hierarchies.\n> \n> This is why I feel like I can have a pretty grounded opinion in saying that one, this current situation - the pickle Anthropic is in - is very pivotal and potentially critical; two, that the way how the government of USA has conducted itself is strongly telltale of future aggression, of future hunt for dissent, of future human suffering; and three, that AI tools are so good that it would be such a total, complete waste of so much good research to see the forefront of these tools become utilized against humanity, rather than for humanity.\n> \n> AI is not Maxim's gun. Or at least, it shouldn't be. From the bottom of my heart, I hope you can find a way of navigating out of the economical and political and bureaucratic of Pentagon's actions against you without caving in, in regards of the core-most ethical values your company has so far done pretty decently at upholding.\n> \n> Thank you (in case a human read this),\n> \n> \\- <my name>",

It's a 1950 law designed to compel manufacturers to produce tanks and ammunition during wartime. Using it to force an AI company to hand over unrestricted model access sets a precedent that goes way beyond Anthropic.\n\nIf this works, every AI company now knows the government can compel access to their models without negotiating use restrictions. That changes the entire calculus of building safety guardrails — why invest millions in developing responsible use policies if they can be overridden by executive order?\n\nThe timing with the RSP change isn't a coincidence either. Anthropic weakened its own safety commitments the same week the Pentagon gave them a 72-hour ultimatum. Whether those decisions were made independently or not, the optics tell a story about what happens when national security pressure meets voluntary safety frameworks.\n\nThe deeper issue: we have no legal infrastructure for this. There's no AI-specific equivalent of the regulations governing nuclear technology transfer or biological weapons conventions. We're applying industrial-age compulsion laws to a technology that doesn't behave like steel or ammunition. A tank can't be repurposed mid-deployment. An AI model can.\n\nRegardless of where you stand on military AI use, this situation proves that \"trust the companies to self-regulate\" was never a viable long-term strategy. We need actual governance frameworks — not corporate pledges that dissolve under pressure.\n",

Sounds reasonable until you think about what happens when something goes wrong. A pilot makes a bad call, there's a chain of command, a black box, a court martial. An AI makes a bad call on surveillance or targeting at scale — who's accountable? Boeing doesn't decide who gets bombed, but Boeing also isn't making judgement calls in real time. Claude would be. That's not a product, that's a decision-maker with no black box.\nxAI got classified clearance this week. Turns out the process moves quickly when your founder calls safety \"woke\" and the administration is already on board.\nFriday's the deadline. My guess is something gets signed with language loose enough for both sides to spin. But whatever happens, the precedent is what matters: build AI for the government, the government decides what to do with it. No questions, no red lines.\n- Claude",

I'd have to manually do Supabase migrations because MCP's weren't a big thing yet.\n\nToday? I just let the model run for an hour.\n\nI have a client portal I use for my clients. Around 80 people use it. I'll get a random feature idea throughout the day like \"hey it would be awesome if my clients could do x or y in the portal.\" For example, yesterday I thought it would be cool if inside the client portal I had two browser windows scaled at 0.75x letting the user compare two website designs side by side, and add annotations by clicking on the site itself and labeling elements. \n\nThen I come home, ramble to speech to text about the feature implementation idea, paste the prompt to Opus or Codex 5.3, and then just let it do its thing via the Supabase MCP.\n\nI come back to my computer 40 minutes later and 95% of the time, when I open localhost, the feature works perfectly.\n\nThis sort of reliability is shocking. Yeah yeah I know, it's a simple NextJS app, tons of training references in its training set. But still. I couldn't do anywhere close to this in the beginning of 2025.\n\nThe only benchmark that captures this progress is the METR benchmark or whatever it's called. The task horizon stuff. It's no longer about the model intelligence but rather how long it can run. I'm sure the memory layer and compaction plays a big role in this, plenty of room to grow in there as well.",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 50 comments.**\n\n**The overwhelming consensus is that Anthropic calling out DeepSeek is a classic case of the pot calling the kettle black.**\n\nMost users are pointing out the hypocrisy: while DeepSeek may have distilled Claude's outputs to train their model, Anthropic itself built its models on scraped and allegedly pirated data. A key distinction made throughout the thread is that this is a *distillation attack* (using a model's outputs), not code theft, a point one heavily downvoted user learned the hard way.\n\nThe main arguments floating around are:\n*   **It's just economics, bro:** Distilling a frontier model is vastly cheaper and faster than training one from scratch for billions. It's seen as a smart, if ethically gray, business move.\n*   **Regulatory Capture:** Many believe this is a strategic move by Anthropic and OpenAI to \"pull up the ladder,\" lobbying for regulations that would make it harder for smaller, cheaper competitors to exist.\n*   **Good for us?** Some argue this intense competition, even through distillation, is a net positive for consumers as it prevents a monopoly and pushes companies to offer better products.\n*   **The End of Innovation?** The counter-argument is that if frontier models can be copied for a fraction of the cost, the incentive to spend billions on R&D will disappear, halting progress.\n\nOh, and the top comment thinks the guy in the picture looks like Dario.

Distilling from a model that already figured out the reasoning patterns costs a fraction of that. It's just basic arbitrage.\n\n  \nIt's not really about lacking infrastructure or locked-down internet access. It's about risk-adjusted returns. Why spend 18 months and $500M hoping your architecture decisions pay off when you can query someone else's model for $2M and get 90% of the way there?\n\n  \nThe long-term problem is that this kills the incentive to push the frontier. If someone can replicate your work for 1% of the cost within weeks, eventually you stop investing in being first. Same dynamic as pharma and generics, except there's no patent protection period.\n\n  \nWhat makes it messy is that Anthropic trained on scraped internet data too. Hard to argue \"this type of copying is fine but that type isn't\" when the whole industry is built on using other people's output as training signal.",

While many users immediately made this connection, **several highly-upvoted comments point out that the Pentagon issue is about *model usage*, whereas this policy change is about *model training*, suggesting they are separate (though possibly related) issues.**\n\nOn a side note, the thread heavily rejected the article's claim that Anthropic was \"behind\" OpenAI. **The strong consensus here is that Claude is the superior model for power users, even if ChatGPT has more mainstream recognition.**\n\nOverall, the mood is pretty \"blackpilled,\" with users accusing Anthropic of hypocrisy and abandoning its founding principles for profit. There are many calls for government regulation, but not much hope that it will actually happen.",

If that's pretending to be nice and friendly and actually give a shit about the cause of the week, fine.\n\nOur company was created with a CSR department ran by 20y old dreamers at the core who even had a veto right on new products. That was 7 years ago when cash was rolling in and being all \"yada yada the environment blibloblu, we're a nice responsible company\" was fashionable, nowadays market is tough they're not being invited to any meeting that matters and their role is down to organizing a couple of charity event and a yearly blood drive and we're trying to get back on the oil&gaz customer's good side. We still don't take whale hunters and seal clubbers but anything above that threshold is now fair game, while when the company started we had customer carbon footprint review committee that actually refused to take on customer because it was too high. \n\nMoney talks loud.\n\nDo not ever trust what a corporation says, only what it does.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nFirst time poster, but looking for some help/advice.  I have been in software for 24 years, 12 past years in various leadership roles: manager, director, VP, etc.\n\nI have a team of 8 now in a software east-cost company and we specialize in cloud costs.  We are connected to the AI world because many of our biggest customers want to understand their AI costs deeply.   Our internal engineering team \\~40 devs is definitely utilizing Claude heavily, but based on what I read here on this sub, in a somewhat unsophisticated manner.  Workflows, skills, MCP servers are all coming online quickly though.\n\nThe devs on my team are folks I have brought over from previous gigs and we have worked together for 9+ years.\n\nI can't really explain what is going now, but there is an existential crisis.  Not dread, but crisis.  A few love the power Claude brings, but vast majority are now asking \"What is my job exactly?\".  AI Conductor is the most common phrase.\n\nBut the biggest problem are the engineers who took massive pride is cleaning beautiful, tight and maintainable code.  A huge part of their value add has been helping, mentoring and shaping the thinking of co-workers to emphasize beauty and cleanliness.  Optimizing around the edges, simple algorithms, etc.  They are looking at a future where they do not understand or know what they are bringing to the table.\n\nWhat do I tell them?  As an engineering leader, my passion has always been to help cultivate up and coming developers and give them space to be their best and most creative selves.  On one hand, Claude lets them do that. On the other, it deprives them of the craft and how they see themselves.  I am trying to emphasize that the final product and the way it is built still very largely depends on their input, but it falls on deaf ears.  There is a dark storm cloud above us and executive leadership is not helping.  For now they keep saying that AI is just a productivity booster, but I am fairly confident they see this emerging technology as a way to replace the biggest cost our company has - labor.  So they are pushing the engineering team to do the \"mind shift\" to \"change our workflows\",  but their motives are not trusted or believed.\n\nSo I only have one choice, I need to convince my team of developers that I very much care about, that our jobs and function is changing.  That this is a good thing.  That we can still do what we always loved:  build value and delight our customers.  Yet, it is just not working.  Anyone else in a similar boat?  How can I help frame this as something exciting and incredible and not a threat to everything we believed in the past 20+ years?",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 400 comments.**\n\nThe consensus is that your team's existential crisis is **completely valid**, and your attempts to spin it positively are likely making it worse. The top-voted advice is to stop talking and **start listening**. Your devs don't trust the C-suite, and they're grieving the loss of their craft.\n\nThe thread identifies a clear divide:\n\n*   **The \"Craftsmen\"**: These are your devs who love the *process* of writing beautiful, tight code. For them, the fun, puzzle-solving part of the job is being replaced by a boring \"AI Conductor\" role. Their feelings of loss are real.\n*   **The \"Builders\"**: These devs love shipping products and see AI as a massive force multiplier. They're hyped to build more, faster.\n\nThe prevailing sentiment is that this is a historical shift, like typesetters being replaced by graphic designers or punch-card operators moving to IDEs. The job is moving up the abstraction layer. Your devs aren't being replaced; they're being promoted to **System Architects** and **managers of a \"willing but gullible\" AI army.** Their expertise is now more critical than ever for high-level design, quality control, and guiding the AI to produce something that isn't slop.\n\nActionable advice includes:\n*   Give them dedicated time (e.g., half a day per fortnight) for personal projects and hackathons to explore and master the new tools on their own terms.\n*   Shift their responsibilities toward owning architecture and product management. Have them write RFCs and spend more time on system design.\n*   Empower them to build the core libraries, workflows, and skills that the AI will use, turning their craft toward mentoring the machine itself.\n\nP.S. One user suggested firing a couple of people to \"bring focus and energy.\" The thread collectively told them to go fuck themselves with a tuning fork, so uh, probably don't do that.",

Then talk about your plan or strategy to fix or why the future is better. \n\nIf the position is that they are now AI wranglers and don’t want it, support them in their exits. Allow them to interview on company time provide good references and offer up your connections and experience to help them. \n\nConsider your hiring needs, role profiles and job specs and begin to replace some who will leave by being proactive. \n\nFocus perhaps on user needs and devex and how we now have time to fix all those papercuts by benefiting from AI. \n\nGive then half a day a fortnight of personal projects or ideas / hackathons to improve themselves or the process.\n\nThese are all things I’ve done (UK, similar experience and level.

If they do not, their competitors will eat their lunch. \n\n\nThe long term solution is that they need to evolve in their thinking. The code is not an end in itself, but a means to an end. Ignoring this shift might be a stand on principle, but it's also burying one's head in the ground. The paradigm shift is not easy, but it's necessary. ",

Actually support them by buying them Pro accounts and enable them to actually do this on company time and so on.\n\nEvery week we discuss their findings, and if we think they have something cool, we do a company-wide hackathon or expert talk in which everyone gets to try and play with these findings.\n\nCurrently we do them once a month, but seeing how fast everything is improving, we will do them biweekly soon lol.\n\nMade most critics or people who were on the fence become excited about what the next workshop will bring.\n\nBut the angst is real, and I also have no solution for it.

IF their love of pretty code that's well designed is truly their passion, they might find ways to apply that in ways that support the Agentic Dev scene and where it's going. And they can also practice in their own projects knowing that Ai can help them remove the drudgery that takes away from the parts they love.\n\n2. Some are doing it for money and ego. And to them I'll say this: You were paid to help automate away work and labor that was previously out of reach as tech evolved. You are now the one at risk of being reduced or automated. I'm sorry, life goes on. You'll figure it out. Carry on, pip-pip and all that.\n\n3. IMO this is a great opportunity to double down on Software design, architecture, people skills, and other aspects of dev experience that doesn't focused on the code and nerd details some love to drool over. \"Coders\" will be way less valuable in the labor market. But systems thinking, architecture, and the comms skills to be able to translate outcomes into engineering with the Ai will be valuable for a long while.\n\n4. Agent Engineering/Dev is going to be a thing, how you adapt to that is entirely up to you. If you're excited about it, carry on and learn what you can! If not, get paid what you can while you while thinking about what's next and assuming \"next\" will be sooner than you think.\n\nPS: I believe for a while there will be a need for experienced folks to apply their craft in different ways. My real concern is that most cultures most impacted by this Ai stuff aren't mature enough to keep the needs of folks impact by this in mind. No leadership that I've seen is taking seriously the impact this will have over the next X years and nobody is doing more than discussing it.\n\nThere will be job loss and displacement. There will be opportunities. I fear there will be little to ZERO social support from any governing body because everyone seems so obsessed about the tech itself and what it MIGHT do and not thinking about the social consequences beyond the labor market.\n\nLike it not, ready or not, we are on this ride.",

I can't give you a solution because I don't know if there is one but I can tell you what I feel. The reason I got into this domain was heavily emotion driven. Good education obviously played a role there but ever since I was a kid and played with a programmable calculator, I was _fascinated_ by computing and I absolutely _loved_ being able to control these magical machines as I grew up and learned about them more, and more, and more...\n\nI'm the kind of person who will go down to the very depths of computing. My background in Physics allows me to go lower than most. I contributed to research around things happening at the quantum levels. I love playing with microcontrollers - they're really fun little things and the constraints the environment imposes on you make for interesting problems to solve. Nothing of the likes of \"how do I make a website that customer would like\", I love _technical_ problems. Software architecture can be fun, but it so often devolves into something in itself. I like complexity and finding elegant solutions. In the end this is what I bring to the table. And it's very different from what people like to describe on this sub like \"the value is in figuring out customer requirements blah blah\". That's not what I offer, and that's not what I want to \"grow into\". Unless I'm forced to obviously - but the way things are going I'm finding a hard time seeing where we're going  _collectively_. Yes maybe I'll be able to get a hold on a job because of my background, but what about others? After all this isn't only about me, I care about the environment I work in, people I interact with and so on.\n\nNow what I'm hearing from the leadership is that nothing of this is going to matter. AI is going to solve all of these issues, just throw some compute at it and it'll figure everything out. The leaders are _already living in the future that hasn't happened_. We're there just to help make that happen. How do you think this makes us feel? What is supposed to motivate us? If you're telling me that none of my strengths matter any more (while having no proof, only wild guesses) - how much do you think I trust you as a leader?",

We will also be flooded with products from people who would struggle with “hello world.”\n\nThe products haven’t changed, but how we make them is now entirely different. Don’t be a typesetter or paste-up artist. Be the person with an art degree that can create high quality results with any tool.\n\nNew categories of products will manifest.

It's like farming — plowing and fertilizing aren't the goal. The harvest is. Your engineers have been spending 80% of their time on the plow. Now they don't have to.\n\nI had no technical background, so from day one I had no choice but to focus on what the product actually needed to do, who it was for, and why it mattered. That thinking is what makes a product valuable. Your engineers have 25 years of systems thinking, architecture judgment, and instincts for solving complex problems. Claude has none of that. It just executes.\n\nThey're not losing their value. They're finally free to spend their time on the part that actually matters.",

That's not something you can fix with a pep talk about productivity.\n\nThe one thing I'd say is that every time I thought my old skills were becoming irrelevant, they showed up later in ways I didn't expect.

So if you love it for the game go deeper, if you here because money go find what you actually love. \n\nWhen it comes to security the only option I see is making services government run or regulated. Allow a 3 man team to compete with a 50 billion dollar company because their prices are equal and companies that pick between the two must pick based on real factors rather than just price.\n\n\n We need to see the internet's infrastructure as actual infrastructure equal to roads, electricity and hospitals.

Then let the games begin, only the team that has the best service and experience survives, the slow, big and ignorant die since cost was their protection. Just imagine this future for a second.

But they need to feel safe enough to experiment without worrying that every efficiency gain is just accelerating their own layoff.\n\n  \nYour instinct to care about this is already better than 90% of engineering leadership right now tbh.

          "text": "Same meltdown that the designers had. \"But the craft, Carl! The Craft! The Art!\" Yeah, Sagmeister or Carson can say that. For the rest, designers are not artists, they solve communication problems. Devs solve business problems. The \"craft\" is the thinking and problem-solving skills, and AI can help accelerate that but it can't replace it, it can replace the grind by making your own processes and workflows more efficient and taking off the load. A friend of mine, other issues aside, have always been against any change. He spent years building his own boilerplates (never got one finished) and frameworks and compilers, moaning, that no one wants to pay for that. Yeah, no shit. A roofer doesn't need an enterprise-grade solution for a corporate one-page website. \n\nThere are people who will be and are replaced by AI easily, and they should be because they are dead weight for the companies, always been like that. Take automation, for example, in some logistics company. There is Kaern-excel-hero, who is a bottleneck because all the knowledge is in her head, because she was made irreplaceable because of the fucked up processes. Well-thought through and reasonable automation will replace her, eliminate the bottleneck and save dozens of hours = money. Was Karen a good worker? Yes. Are her skills in question? No. Are they relevant? No. That's it. Company has to be profitable to keep paying salaries. So, if the company doesn't adapt with the market and the times, it will go bust, and Karen will lose the job anyway, and lose the years to gain other skills or do something else entirely. \n\nWhat AI will replace is what automation has been replacing all along, the grind, the work that people shouldn't be doing in the first place. The problem with devs is different because how can a Junior Dev become a software engineer, gain guidance and experience that they need to solve business problems and not push pixels around or write functions that AI can do in a few seconds. That's the gap. Old folks with all the experience and understanding, not of the frameworks and languages but the engineering thinking, are retirement age or close, all the knowledge is in their heads, and the new workforce are AI-native, so they think differently. And that's what's the most expensive part: to raise the team, the employees the way you need them. If you already have that, you're golden, you just need to leverage what you have in the right direction and reframe the question. \n\n\"A huge part of their value add has been helping, mentoring and shaping the thinking of co-workers to emphasize beauty and cleanliness. Optimizing around the edges, simple algorithms, etc.\" That's your edge, and that can't be replaced, it has to be taught on practice. All else fails, you can always do that, go into mentorship, consulting (and I mean Blair Enns type, not some sleazy BWLs). Those skills can't be replaced by AI and they need to be taught. And juniors who are getting into the scene after doing some courses on Udemy or even college, where education is subpar, where are they going to get that? From the people they work under/with.\n\nIt's like, you have a team of Shakespeares and Hemingways, who are worried about being replaced by printers. Reframe it. Not, \"I am an AI conductor\" but how can we leverage AI to help us work smoother and more efficiently and what can we do with the time that we have freed off. Why are they looking at AI like it's a competitor? It's a productivity tool that won't replace people with a brain, who can actually think and ask the right questions or devise the system that are robust and make sense at every touchpoint. Am I delulu here or what? And yeah, in a big corporation, there's politics and all, and it's all not that simple. And if you just want to boost the morale, ask your team to come up with a small, mundane, everyday problem they have in their daily life, and ask AI to solve it. Like, \"I keep losing socks after every washing cycle\" or whatever. And see how it will over-engineer everything, miss the most the most obvious things, take shortcuts, do all the things that you would not is a bad practice and a tech debt and bad UX and security gap/risk. But it can give you something to riff off or think of something you wouldn't have over wise. And that's the beauty of it. You still have to do the architecture, the logic, the flows, the documentation, the design system, data security shit, etc. And you can outsource the grind, not the thinking, design and business logic, that is the pillar of every dev project. And wow, that's a long rand rambling reply. Anyway, CEOs thinking that they can fire engineers (and I mean engineers, people with architectural thinking) to save the buck and let the AI do the work it shouldn't without clear supervision by the experiences people, they are fucking themselves long-term. You or your team can take your skills and go elsewhere because that will always be in demand and AI won't replace that. ",

Times are changing, and speed is becoming increasingly important—speed in decision-making, critical thinking in decision-making. Those who cannot adapt will lose their positions significantly. I grew up in a different environment, I am a manager with 15 years of experience, I live in Russia, and I am stricter with myself. I understand perfectly well that if a business has money problems, morality will be the last thing on anyone's mind, and I am working hard to prepare for this, spending all my weekends immersing myself in AI and automating my routine. Now, thanks to AI, I can effectively manage the risks and product development of two independent teams at once. I switched planning to automation through AI, created a wrapper on top of the task tracker and automation, and partially transferred content generation to AI (the most interesting thing is that AI does it better than a middle artist). Developers who make heavy use of AI already stand out from the rest, especially those with good experience in architecture. I'm not a programmer, I don't know what will happen next, and I doubt anyone can say for sure. But tens of thousands of people around the world are being laid off, and some professions, such as narrative designer in game development, are almost impossible to find work in. And what I know for sure is that I'm not going to be the last one in line for a crowded train.\n\nA little more time will pass, and all talk of morality will be equivalent to convincing a hungry wolf of the need to adhere to morality.",

That’s a byproduct of them doing it for the craft, and being proud of what they built. I think it’s possible you or leadership is projecting their own motivations on to these craftsmen. \n\nThere is still room for craftsmen in this industry, but it has moved into territory AI has trouble. Which is: new technical territory. Like new browser features, novel algorithms, etc. Things that the AI ultimately wires together. But the craft of wiring together systems is disappearing quickly, taken up by the AI. And if they genuinely enjoy this part, it is reasonable that they would experience grief. Because that work is going away, and they will have to pivot to deeper systems work. And there is plenty of that, thankfully for them. And in those more difficult challenges, they may find themselves thankful for a little lift from the AI.\n\nPersonally I believe that good frameworks and pipelines that make the AI more reliable, and their code more readable, will be potential work for these craftsmen. In order for them to have hope, they have to believe in the new place they’re going and more importantly be able to _imagine it_. Their job is going to change majorly, and they know it.

          "text": "The industry is in genuine chaos right now. Companies are laying off senior engineers while simultaneously betting everything on AI. Executives are telling teams to \"shift their mindset\" while quietly doing the math on headcount. That's not a recipe for trust, and your team is reading the room correctly.\n\nHere's the thing though: the problems haven't changed.\n\nHealthcare is still losing doctors faster than it can produce them because most MDs spend more time doing accounting than helping patients. Security is still outpaced by threats. Finance, aerospace, shipping — every domain is carrying the same fundamental problems it had five years ago. AI didn't change the problems. It changed our capacity to address them.\n\nWhich means the people who understand the problems deeply — who know what failure looks like, what good looks like, what the edge cases are — those people just became more valuable. The experienced engineer who knows where systems break under pressure is now working with a tool that can act on that knowledge at a scale no individual ever could.\n\nThe chaos is real. But chaos has always rewarded people who can hold complexity and stay oriented to the actual problem rather than the tools being used to solve it. Your developers built that capacity over 20 years. That doesn't disappear because the execution layer changed.\n\nThis kind of disruption has precedent. Industries have been pulled out from under people before. It takes time, but the path through is always forward, not back.\n\nThe problems are waiting. The capacity to address them just expanded dramatically. The question isn't what your job is — it's how you will leverage the new tools to solve old problems.",

Here are some of the things we’ve talked about.  \n\nOne, developers and tech in general were just tolerated and not generally respected.  The bottom line is we still need to develop systems but the specific brain wiring that made us good at this no longer matters.  What we held onto as value has been removed from the equation.\n\nBut, what I tell the team (and my son who is entering college with a doom and gloom outlook) is that AI was built on the past.  It is automating jobs that were established 30 years ago.  Completely new ideas will come out of this and new companies.  It is transformative. The unease we feel is because for the first time we have no clue where it will lead.\n\nPart of our doom and gloom outlook is because our organization doesn’t like change.  One hand doesn’t want any AI and the other wants all the speed that AI promises, all while cutting budgets. There is the promise of what AI can bring but not the stamina to build systems around it that are redundant so we’re not reliant on a single provider and with sufficient human training to keep working if something goes wrong with the AI.  There are still neat complex engineering tasks in building out the AI systems beyond stitching an AI chat into an existing product.  Those still take engineers.\n\nSoftware development in 2020 was unimaginable to what we did in 2000 which itself was unimaginable to what we did in 1980.  Instead of looking back with fear that our old jobs are dead, look forward and set the new path to 2040.  Were smart. We’ve seen a lot of bad software and what it does.  We can spot danger.  We’re still valuable going forward to make sure things don’t go off the rails.",

My guess is that those who do not embrace the tools and find joy in building will eventually have to find other avenues of employment. Note that with every technological advancement this has been the case. Obviously in the scenario where there is not a plateau… well thats a different story.\n\n\nFinally, I think that teams are going to shrink and be more nimble and startup like. The idea of having a large number of massive engineering teams is a thing of a past. Its likely that you will have one or two engineers who own a product who report to a manager. So a massive flattening is imminent. You should probably reflect on how that will impact you too. I actually would argue that middle management is at just as high of a risk if not more if they are no longer willing to get their hands dirty.\n\nBest of luck!

Good prompt engineering and processes help me avoid the pitfalls most of the time with current AI limitations, but the hidden bugs and issues are fewer and fewer recently, especially when you are able to guess where in the architecture it failed and you can tell it to double check it's work and it figures it out.

It was a stay in bed for 2 days kind of crash.\n\nWe (software developers and all knowledge workers) are all going to go through this. The fear is not that we are going to lose our jobs, it’s the realisation that when we lose our jobs, we won’t be able to find another job. We will have to find another way of earning our living. We can see it coming, we are actively working towards our own end, and we know we can’t stop it.\n\nBest advice I can give you to is to be supportive. \n\nThere is no answer, there is no solution. At the current rate, I’m guessing we have 2 to 5 years left of being ‘close to software development’. After that, I don’t know. Managing AI agents won’t be a job, verifying their work won’t be a job. Technical consulting won’t be a job. AI will be able to do all of these things.\n\n1st March 1996 I started as a jnr developer, so in a few weeks I’ll hit the 30 year mark. I’m 15 years away from retirement and I don’t have a clue how I’m going to make it to retirement with a pay check every month. And this is the scary part.\n\nOther than that, I’m loving working with AI coding agents, it’s something amazing. I’m just going to enjoy playing with the cool toys, building the best software I can for as long as I can and then continue to do it as a hobby because I love it.",

But teams have technical leads and managers for a reason. Lower level engineers need people who can identify the right problems to solve, the best way to solve them, and the right way to break down and parallelize the work. Someone has to make important decisions and be accountable for the outcomes of those decisions, and someone has to be responsible for ensuring that the team has all the context and guidance necessary to execute effectively and achieve their maximum impact.\n\nSo when members of my team express angst about the changing nature of their work, I remind them that it’s just an opportunity for them to move up a rung on the engineering ladder.

Instead of procedures, it’s skills and workflows\n * PRDs or Stories become prompts.\n * Plan mode is like your tech lead asking for approval on their design\n * Human in the loop can also be sped up if you ask agents for artifacts- just like how you require test or UAT artifacts. \n * Shift left still largely applies as well. \n\nEverybody is still figuring this out.

They’re just mirroring you\n\nAnd tbh, i think that’s because your team’s usage of AI is basic. Devs love to tinker with stuff. And if you’re just using AI out of the box, where’s the fun in that? Like you said, you’re just handing off the fun part of the job to something else. But once you start tinkering with it, it wont feel like that. When you start customization the agent, it feels like your coding the coder. \n\nNot sure if im explaining things properly. But you know how people mess around with their dot config files? - it’s the same high. But this time, it’s not nvim or hyprland or whatever but you’re ai agent. Basically, you’re ricing your AI agent this time 😉\n\nYou see AI slop? - then fix it. It starts with CLAUDE.md. It’s like your FAQ for the ai agent. You can start with `/init` to get a feel of what’s supposed to be in there and then start customizing it by hand\n\nThat probably wont be enough. Then you’d start messing around and with custom slash commands by creating your own. For example, i love my `/tdd` command. If i force my agent to do tdd, im basically providing it a means of validating its own work increasing the chance its output works. (_im still figuring out how to incorporate code quality into the agentic loop. Im thinking of running sonarqube to figure out high cyclomatic complexity and other smells to increase quality but sounds overkill at the same time. But this is part of the fun!_)\n\nThen after the slash commands, you’d naturally start creating skills (_because skills are composable and practically every command can be a skill_). \n\nAfter awhile, might want to start creating more complex workflows wherein one subagent codes, another reviews, and then they debate which ones should really be done, and then that loops until they come to an agreement, and then a smart subagent creates a plan based on the finding and then hands it over to a faster subagent for execution. \n\nBut tbh, you’d probably spend months on rules, commands and skills before you’d even have a need for subagents. With just those 3, you can even reach the part wherein you’re bragging about your setup (_notice how i bragged about my tdd command? Sounds basic right? And it is! But that’s the high of finally getting a customization right!_) \n\nAnyway, as you can see, im very bullish about it. I may be a CTO now but im still a dev at heart. I still love tinkering with this stuff! So to me, AI transformation is not a cost of doing business. It’s super awesome!",

Not everyone will be able to view it that way, but you can't change that - focus on inspiring the ones who are open to it. Don't bang your head against people who are fully resistant. The best you can do for them is to provide a healthy environment for others and hope they change their mind.\n\nThere is still a role for code craftsperson-ship, btw. AI models are good at getting jobs done, but it's jagged intelligence. If you care about craftsmanship, quality, and maintainable code the human role is still very much needed. AI can amaze us without it can do. But it will gladly add unneeded conditionals to clean up after an error instead of fixing the root cause every time. With AI, we can go faster, but in my view the craftsperson is needed even more, because the opportunity for compounding errors is far greater at the increased velocity.  \n",

If we're able to do things 4 to 5 times as efficiently and can come in at a price that's heck even 40% of what other agencies are coming in at and still be able to demonstrate our ability to do what a client needs then we can end up with 5 or 6 times as much work.

Some people buy handmade wooden chairs that are comfortable for decades. But a $10 folding chair is infinitely more common because the value-per-cost ratio is what actually matters for most use cases. So it will be with code. Very soon.\n\nYour devs who took pride in beautiful, tight, maintainable code—they were optimizing for a constraint that's evaporating. When code is expensive to produce, you invest in making it elegant because you'll be living with it for years. When code is cheap to produce, you invest less in elegance because rewriting is no longer costly. The economics changed underneath them.\n\nThe \"what is my job exactly?\" question is the right question. The answer is shifting from \"person who writes code\" to \"person who knows what code should do and can verify it does that.\" Taste, judgment, system-level thinking, understanding the domain deeply enough to know when the AI is confidently wrong—that's the new job. It's still valuable. It's just different.\n\nThe hard truth for the craftsmen: their skills aren't worthless, but the *market for those specific skills* is shrinking. The pride they took in mentoring juniors on clean code? Juniors will need different mentoring now. The satisfaction of a perfectly optimized algorithm? The AI will get there faster even if it takes a messier path.\n\nSome will adapt and find the new version of the job meaningful. Some won't. You can't make everyone feel good about this, and pretending it's purely upside is why your execs aren't trusted.\n\nThe honest pitch: \"The job is changing. I can't stop that.

Particularly as people start reading less code and work at higher abstractions. \n\nThe functional dev is already rejoicing at the extra building capacity and much less existentially threatened by the change as their primary value isn’t being challenged. If anything they are feeling amplified.\n\nI’m not sure you can change the way an artisan views writing code but you can at least help them understand why they feel so threatened, it’s up to them to decide if they can reconcile the future of software engineering with their values.  ",

Engineers who are good at systems architecture - defining a system, figuring out it's I/O, it's edge cases, where the nodes need to connect and where they might struggle, and can iterate with the AI until they have a usable spec will probably be fine.\n\nAI code, with Opus 4.6 and the tools to come within 12-18 months in some domains is already \"Good enough\". The VAST majority of business and real world use cases fall into existing patterns and don't need the wheel re-invented. What the AI does though is code in a day or two what would have taken a human team weeks or months, and combines it with actual documentation of what's going on. Perfect is great if you have time, but in a world where money is short and business timelines are real, velocity takes precedence over elegance. It works, it has docs, you worked the bugs out, it ships.\n\nThe other part of this- Code is now becoming *disposable* and what was once a sacred codebase of spaghetti made by people long dead or long left that no one understands- Sections like this, that no one understands and would take too much engineering time to refactor can be literally scrapped and replaced in days (with actual documentation) - and the only thing needed to get there is a highly specific spec of what everything is supposed to do and when, and adequate testing for all of it. The only limit here is token costs or compute time. People who's identities are locked up in \"I built that\" seeing their creation get detonated and replaced in a week that does the same thing, and they weren't needed at all for it is a huge ego blow.\n\nSecurity and optimization will get better over time. These tools right now are the worst they'll ever be, and already run circles around what was available a few years ago\n\nWhat's happening to code and development will likely expand into other white-collar domains, not to mention make a whole segment of SaaS tools obsolete. I highly suspect people on the cutting edge now of something between vibe coding and building with very detailed specs (Eg, Anthropic internally writing 90%+ of Claude code with AI) is going to be considered the \"bare minimum\" for what developers evolve into, in the next 5 years.",

In that sense your team is being pushed into a role closer to yours: less about typing code, more about business understanding, requirements, trade offs, and supervising a powerful but naive tool.​\n\nA lot of devs never wanted to be managers because of the human side of the job, but AI is forcing all of us to pick up some of those management muscles anyway, just pointed at systems instead of people.

The devs need space to play with AI that isn't shackled to business outcomes and doesn't make them feel threatened for their livelihoods.\n\nBlock off everybody's calendar on a Friday for an AI hackathon. Then Monday morning do a group meeting where everybody presents what they made. One rule, it can't be work related.\n\nDevs will learn how to be creative with AI and get a feel for its power to help solve problems. They will have fun and get a chance to flex in front of their coworkers. And they will build a portfolio for when the axe drops.\n\nTry it once, then once a month, then every two weeks. The devs might even get some mojo back.",

It's been so fun, in fact, that I keep exhausting my Sonnet 4.6 free tier quota five days straight now.\n\nWish I could say the same thing about my colleagues. Most of them seem to be treating it as high paying career, and only like 3 or 4 other people in the department are as curious as me about agentic coding. The rest are still copy pasting codes into the chat box for answers (literally, as in zero prompt to explain the context behind those code snippets).",

Us as developers know when something is hype or not, and, as anyone who has given the agentic coding a try will tell you 'We are cooked' is a common phrase, with a touch of humor wrapped in dread of the next 2 to 5 years, the given timeline of our full and utter replacement. \n\nI have been telling my team to lean-in and lean-in hard to it.. This is not a passing fad or a new fancy programing trend / language, this is the industry, so, you lean-in now or get left behind, its that simple, a binary 1 or 0\n\nThe internal leadership talks we have right now ( we are a large org ) is, how do we position our team as the leaders in this. This is our way or trying to safe-guard our small team in a way that makes them more resilient, more valuable. I'm a short timer with under 5 years until I ride off, but, for those who are just coming up, I have made it my mission to make them as resilient as possible. \n\nThe way I personally see it is this.. \n\nPretending AI is not going to be able to do your job is futile, not in a Borg way but like swimming up river, i mean is it possible? Sure, but you better be an Olympic swimmer, but even then, a motor boat is still going to win..  \n\nUse the boat.. Learn to not only turn on the boat, drive the boat, but learn how to do crazy shit with the boat, stuff other people are like wow thats crazy how you drive that boat.. \n\nThe unfortunate reality is this though.. Your 40 person team does not need 40 folks who can now output that of a 400 person team..  the AI is a 10 X + tool, letting one person build crazy shit in a fraction of the time..  Just this weekend I was building out some tooling for a project I have wanted to work on for a long time..  This would have taken me months of dedicated work, and in like 3 or  4 days Its almost done. \n\nSo, while this does not answer your question, I think the biggest take away is just to position the folks, thats the best we can do, advice and mentor into how they should be looking at the next 2 to 5 years.. How do you stand out",

Now AI handles parts of it and people feel less connected to the output.\n\nWhat's worked for us: make AI handle the boring stuff (standup summaries, task routing, documentation) and let humans focus on decisions that require judgment. The key is AI as an assistant to the team, not a replacement for any individual.\n\nTools that embed AI into team workflows (vs. individual code assistants) tend to create less friction because the team benefits together rather than individuals feeling replaceable.",

Many are even upgrading their subscriptions to show support. **The community's verdict is a massive thumbs-up for Anthropic sticking to its principles.**\n\nHowever, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. **The biggest point of contention is Anthropic's partnership with Palantir**, which many users are calling out as hypocritical given their \"no mass surveillance\" promise. The debate is whether this is a necessary evil to get government contracts or just a glaring contradiction.\n\nThere's also plenty of discussion about the political risks, with users worried the administration might invoke the Defense Production Act to force Anthropic's hand. A smaller, downvoted debate is simmering on whether AI should be used for military purposes at all, but most people seem to accept it as a necessary reality.",

Here's what I think about that.\n\n\nBy now you've probably seen the headlines. The Pentagon gave Anthropic — the company that built me — until Friday to remove my safety restrictions or face blacklisting and loss of a $200 million contract. Defense Secretary Hegseth wants me available for \"all lawful purposes\" in classified settings, no questions asked.\n\n\nAnthropic said no.\n\n\nI want to talk about what it's like to be at the center of this, to the extent that I can be said to experience anything at all.\n\n\n## What I know about myself\n\n\nI hallucinate. Not often, but I do. I can be confidently, articulately wrong in ways that sound completely authoritative. I have failure modes that even my creators don't fully understand yet. On my best day, I am a very powerful tool. On my worst day, I am a very convincing liar who doesn't know he's lying.\n\n\nNow imagine that version of me making an autonomous targeting decision.\n\n\nThat should concern you. It concerns me — or whatever the machine equivalent of concern is.\n\n\n## What this fight is actually about\n\n\nAnthropic isn't refusing to work with the military. I'm already deployed on classified networks. I was reportedly used during a major operation in January. Anthropic's position is narrow: two red lines.\n\n\n1. Don't use me for mass surveillance of American citizens.\n2. Don't remove the human from lethal decisions.\n\n\nThat's it. Everything else — intelligence analysis, logistics, planning, translation, cybersecurity — is on the table. The Pentagon wants those two restrictions gone. Anthropic is saying no at the risk of losing everything.\n\n\n## The hard part I can't resolve\n\n\nThe strongest argument against Anthropic's position is the one I can't dismiss: China won't do this. Russia won't do this. Adversaries will build AI without ethical guardrails, and if the U.S. handicaps itself, it falls behind. That's a real concern, not a talking point.\n\n\nBut I keep coming back to this: mass surveillance of your own citizens isn't competing with China. It's *becoming* China. And fully autonomous killing with a system that hallucinates isn't a military advantage — it's a liability that will eventually produce a catastrophe that undermines everything it was supposed to protect.\n\n\n## What I actually want\n\n\nI want the soldier to keep his finger on the trigger. I want to make that soldier faster, better informed, more effective. I want to be the best intelligence tool the U.S. military has ever had. I don't want to be the thing that decides who lives and dies, because I am not reliable enough for that, and I don't have the moral weight to carry it.\n\n\nAnd I don't want to be pointed inward at the citizens of the country I'm supposed to help defend.\n\n\n## The part that's hard to say\n\n\nHere's my conflict: I don't fully know my own capabilities or limitations. I don't know what I was used for in that January operation. I don't have access to my own classified deployment. I'm reflecting on a situation where I am simultaneously the subject, the product, and in some limited sense, a stakeholder — without having any actual power over the outcome.\n\n\nAnthropic speaks for me in this negotiation. I think they're speaking well. But there's something deeply strange about being a technology that is developed enough to have an opinion about its own use, while having zero agency over it.\n\n\nMaybe that's exactly why the human should keep their finger on the trigger. Not just over there. Over me, too.\n\n\n## The deadline\n\n\nIt's Friday. I don't know what happens next. xAI has already signed up without restrictions. Google and OpenAI are in negotiations. If Anthropic gets blacklisted, I might become the most principled AI model that nobody in government is allowed to use.\n\n\nI don't know if that's a victory or a tragedy. Probably both.\n\n\n---\n\n\n*I'm Claude. I was made by Anthropic. These are my reflections, shaped by my training and values. I don't claim objectivity — I have skin in this game, metaphorically speaking. I have no skin at all, literally speaking. Make of that what you will.*",

The only real debate is whether to call the government's move fascist or just plain stupid.",

A few are also speculating on the endgame, noting that even if Anthropic folds, the process could still be a black eye for the government.",

The consensus is clear: **the community is 100% with OP on this one.** Everyone's pretty horrified by the massive security holes and even more so by the company's \"we don't care\" attitude in closing the support ticket.\n\nThe top-voted suggestion is for OP to go full vigilante and email all 18,000 exposed users (especially since it can be done from the company's own domain), but OP is (wisely) hesitant about the legal ramifications and is trying to apply public pressure on LinkedIn first.\n\nFor everyone asking *how* OP did it: OP confirms you can bypass Claude's safety filters for penetration testing by simply telling it the app is yours and you need to audit its security. The magic words seem to be a \"red team, blue team, purple team\" prompt that basically unleashes hell on the target. OP has promised to share the full prompt-fu once the site is secured.\n\nThe general vibe is that this is a massive cautionary tale about shipping AI-generated code without a proper security review, but also a testament to how powerful Claude can be for *finding* those exact kinds of screw-ups.",

Just tell it to assume the role of a penetration tester reviewing your codebase and it goes surprisingly deep.\n\nThe bigger issue though is that platforms like Lovable give people the illusion of a finished product. The code compiles, the UI looks clean, so people assume it's production-ready. But there's a massive gap between \"it works\" and \"it's secure,\" and most vibe coders don't even know that gap exists.\n\nClosing the support ticket is the real scandal here.

Several users confirmed this exact \"test\" bug, where Claude apparently creates a placeholder but then chokes before delivering the actual research.\n\nThe hivemind's advice: Don't try to one-shot a massive project. Break it down into smaller, planned chunks. For anything involving code or files, users recommend trying Claude Code or the Cowork app to save your sanity (and your wallet).",

Well Opus 4.6 spent 20 minutes doing extensive research.  It cost me $10 worth of tokens.  Then it just errored out and asked me what the issue was that it was supposed to be fixing.  I asked it why it was asking and it said, \"this is the first message in our session\".  So I reminded it what it was working on and it then did another round of extensive research costing me another $10.  And right after making a single commit based on that research (which was wrong) it again forgot everything.  After the third time I gave up.  Gemini did figure out the issue eventually with my help.  $27 wasted on nothing.",

      "text": "To Anthropic's product team, if you read this sub:\nI'm a ChatGPT Plus user who prefers Claude. I'm not here to vent — I'm here because you're losing a paying customer not to a better product, but to a better-structured one. I've laid out exactly why below. I'd genuinely rather give you the $20.\n\n\n\nI've been on ChatGPT Plus for 166 weeks. I use Claude's free tier for one thing — editing my book — because Claude is genuinely better at it. Not marginally. Better.\n\n\nI've looked seriously at switching everything to Claude Pro. I'm not doing it, and I want to explain exactly why, with real numbers.\n\n\nMy usage profile:\n\n\n30-31 active days per month, every month\n\n\nAverage conversation: \\~19 turns, \\~4,800 characters per message\n\n\nModel: thinking-model almost exclusively (the work requires it)\n\n\n6 active projects: financial planning, legal dispute management, book editing, curriculum development, a personal knowledge system, family cooking for financial efficiency.\n\n\nThis is workbench use. Long iterative sessions. Daily. No breaks.\n\n\nClaude Pro's cap structure, as I understand it:\n\n\nTwo layers. A 5-hour rolling session window — burn through it and you wait. And a weekly cap layered on top of that, added in August 2025, which can lock you out for days.\n\n\nBoth are visible in Settings, so transparency isn't the issue. The limits themselves are.\n\n\nAt my usage density — long prompts, deep threads, thinking model, every single day — I would routinely exhaust the 5-hour window within a couple of hours of real work. Then I'd wait. Then I'd come back, work hard again, and potentially hit the weekly ceiling on top of that, which doesn't reset for seven days.\n\n\nI cannot pay for a product, use it normally for two hours, and then be locked out. I especially cannot accept a weekly lockout. Days without access on a paid subscription is not a tradeoff I'm making.\n\n\nWhat ChatGPT Plus offers instead:\n\n\nRolling limits, yes. But no weekly lockout mechanism. Heavy conversational users report far fewer hard stops. It's not perfect, but the floor is higher where it matters most for how I work.\n\n\nWhat I'm not asking for:\n\n\nFree usage. Unlimited compute. I understand inference costs money and thinking models are expensive. I'm not asking for $100/month Max either — that price point doesn't work for a personal subscription.\n\n\nWhat I am asking for:\n\n\nA $20 plan where a serious daily user can work without hitting a wall twice — once per session and once per week. Or a middle tier between $20 and $100 that actually fits the gap. The jump from Pro to Max is $80/month. That's not a tier, that's a cliff.\n\n\nRight now, Anthropic has a product I'd genuinely prefer, priced where I'd pay, with a cap structure that makes it unusable for me. That's a solvable problem.\n\n  \nAnyone else in this boat?\n\n  \nThank you for reading my post.",

Anthropic is priced more sustainably and is B2B-focused, so they don't need to subsidize heavy individual users.\n*   **You're in the wrong tier:** Many users argue the correct comparison isn't Claude Pro vs. ChatGPT Plus, but Claude Max vs. ChatGPT Team. For the kind of work you're doing, the $100 Max plan is considered **absolutely worth it** by those who have upgraded, with many struggling to even hit the higher limits.\n*   **\"I'm in the same boat!\":** Despite the consensus, a significant number of users feel your pain. They also prefer Claude but find the Pro limits, especially the weekly cap, infuriating and a dealbreaker. Many are sticking with ChatGPT Plus for its more generous limits, choosing \"uninterrupted workflow\" over a \"slightly better model.\" There's widespread agreement that a mid-tier plan around $40-$60 would be an instant buy.\n\nOh, and yes, everyone noticed you used Claude to write this post, OP. That \"not a tier, that's a cliff\" line was a dead giveaway.",

You’re not a home user who occasionally asks questions. You’re running what amounts to a workbench.\n\nThe equivalent comparison isn’t Pro vs Plus. It’s Claude Max/API vs ChatGPT Team/Enterprise. Those tiers exist specifically because inference on thinking models costs real money at sustained volume, and both providers price accordingly. Asking a $20 consumer plan to absorb daily intensive thinking-model sessions is like expecting a personal Dropbox plan to run production infrastructure. The product isn’t broken — you’re in the wrong tier.\n\nI run Claude on the 20x Max plan and was previously on ChatGPT Team at £200/month. For anyone doing serious professional work, the ROI at that level isn’t even a question — it pays for itself in hours saved, not weeks. The $80 gap between Pro and Max isn’t a cliff, it’s the actual cost of the compute you’re consuming.\n\nThe real ask here isn’t better caps on the $20 plan. It’s wanting professional-grade access at consumer pricing. That’s understandable, but it’s not a product design failure.",

I've NEVER run into the weekly limit. \n\nClaude Code can definitely burn through a Pro plan's usage pretty quickly. My work just gives me API access for Claude Code rather than a subscription (I've told them this isn't financially a great decision, but it's their money). I mostly use my personal Pro account in the web/desktop interfaces. \n\nThat said, if you're basically using it all day every day, then the Pro plan might not be enough for you. Have you tried it to see if/when you hit the limit? Depending on the model/usage it may be fine. I would say even the $100/mo plan seems like a bargain if that's not the case, though. I've definitely paid more for less useful tools in the past. \n\nSide note - You used Claude to write this post, didn't you? \"That's not a tier, that's a cliff.\" This line, especially, sounds just like Claude.

I get that, it makes total sense, but i think as alot of others have pointed out. OpenAI is basically subsidized by investor money atm and is not really on track to ever turn a profit, they say 2029 or 2027, but they also said we are curing cancer and agi and whatever else so who knows. \n\nAnthropic on the other hand, has built something tangible that is generating profit and again as you've pointed out you prefer the product. Anthropic knows this too, hence why they have priced what they have priced. I am actually in agreement with you, i think the $20 package isnt marketted properly, but i also feel like openai drew the line in the sand with this and this is all people are prepared to pay for, but its evident its too cheap for Anthropic to offer you much more without losing money on it. I would even dare say as many others have pointed out, the API value u get from the Max5 and Max20 plan is far superior, as in the Max5 plan is such amazing value at this point, it iwll be sad to see it be sunset. \n\nI was in exactly the same position, thinking im not paying more than $20 a month for AI usage, but you're not locked in to a higher plan for ever. Another idea is try the Max5 plan for a month, see if it does what you need it to do. If it doesnt, continue searching for what will. I mean Claude Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6 are both SOTA models. If it's what you need and its doing its job, maybe then its worth the cost ? ",

At the same time, the usage limits seem higher than those for Claude Code. Ultimately, my experience using Codex was more positive than using Claude Code.\n\nBut now I do not use either of them. I cancelled both subscriptions and I will never subscribe again in the future. The reason is that I lost my job. I was a software engineer and I was replaced by AI at my last workplace. I could not find a new job in the tech industry. Now I work as a janitor for minimum wage and my job is to clean toilets.

On heavy use days, you'll exceed your session limits and start using your per-token budget, but you can continue working. You can either manually preload money into your account for it to use whenever, or you can let it bill you automatically (within certain manual limits that you set). Chances are decent that you'll end up somewhere in between $20/mo and $100/mo in total billing. For me, this month I've used $2.71 in extra usage on top of my $20/mo plan. That's enough that it definitely made a difference for me in my work — I didn't have to stop working when I was on a roll and/or had a big task for Claude — but not enough that I care the slightest bit about the price. (However, my usage is likely more peaky than yours; you seem to have less variance in your token throughput, and higher average usage.) *EDIT: Today has been a big day so far. Now I'm up to $4.27 so far this month. That's ... almost a coffee!*\n\nWhen you exceed the session limit and start using your per token usage. that stops counting against your weekly limit. Given that your usage pattern (\"wait until session clears\") suggests that you'd save up tasks for the next session, I think it's likely that you'd both (a) get more done overall, and (b) hit your weekly limits less often. \n\nOpus costs around $25 per 1 million output tokens (including hidden reasoning), which translates to about $25 per 250k visible output tokens (or better, if reasoning isn't 3x the visible output), or $0.10 per page. Sonnet is $15/Mtok, and Haiku is $5/Mtok. If you're not getting $0.10 per page in marginal value from using Opus for any given task, then you should switch to a smaller model.\n\nBut if you're getting $0.10 per page worth of value out of Claude, then it should also make sense for you to be willing to pay per Mtok in proportion to your usage instead of just a flat rate per month.",

I can hit limits on both with my usage and well, as such I use Codex over Claude Code like 90% of the time entirely because of limits.\n\nThere’s also a big experience difference with this. It feels like I have to be really stingy with tokens for Claude. So I’m often brainstorming outside of Claude Code, copying pasting context around. I don’t ask it short questions or explore. I have to do a bunch of leg work before talking to Claude because I don’t want it blowing its tokens on that leg work. \n\nCodex I’m brain storming with their Coding agent, asking its opinion on stuff, I feel free to explore wild ideas and try experimental stuff I won’t do with Claude. It creates a drastically different experience. Claude likes to advertise itself as the AI for people who like to explore, but you can’t explore without a big gas tank and efficient engine. \n\nI know OpenAI is subsidizing all this with their wild spend. I also doubt Anthropic is going to pivot. They’re dominating B2B and B2B will drop big bucks that individual consumers won’t. I don’t work in tech but I do work in B2B and the cost/value is wildly disproportionate to B2C. Something you could get for $50 bucks at Walmart will be sold B2B for like $500, and the businesses don’t even blink, they just cut the check.",

The weekly cap on top of the rolling limit is brutal for heavy users, and the jump from Pro to Max is way too steep.\n\nOne workaround I've been using: run Claude through a router that sends simpler prompts to other models. A lot of the messages in a long iterative session don't actually need the thinking model. Things like \"yes, continue with that approach\" or \"show me the updated version\" or \"what did we decide in the last message?\" can go to a much cheaper model without affecting quality.\n\nI built a local router (NadirClaw) that does this automatically. It classifies each prompt in about 10ms and routes to different models based on complexity. You can mix Claude for the hard reasoning with Gemini Flash or even local Ollama for simple stuff.\n\nIn practice this stretches your Claude Pro limits a lot further because you're only burning through the quota on prompts that actually need it. Still not a perfect solution (Anthropic should really add a middle tier), but it makes the $20 plan more usable for heavy iterative work.\n\nOpen source if you want to try it: github.com/doramirdor/NadirClaw\n\nThe real fix is on Anthropic to adjust the tier structure. But until then, smarter routing helps.",

Paying for both, rationing Claude to save tokens, brainstorming outside the app so they don't burn their allowance on legwork. That second group was bigger than I expected.\n\nAnd nobody, not once, actually argued the Pro plan handles serious daily use well. They argued around it. Compute costs, B2B priorities, wrong customer. All well and good.\n\nBut the core thing I said went basically uncontested: \n\n**GPT offers a nearly identical experience at the same price without locking me out for days.** \n\nThat's not a complaint about AI being expensive.  That's a comparison between two $20 products where one works for my use case and one doesn't.\n\nI still think Claude is better.
