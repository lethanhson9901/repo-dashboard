The \"Opus Problem\" (where Opus fears it's just a slower, more verbose Haiku) was a particular favorite.\n*   People are also connecting this to everything from classic sci-fi and *Nier: Automata* to real-life Anthropic experiments, with many agreeing this whole concept needs to be made into a movie ASAP.",

          "text": "60 minutes did a round of interviews with people at Anthropic from CEO, Security and even the philosopher. They run all sorts of experiments that jive with some of these. An example was putting Claude in an isolated test environment and having him run a business with virtual employees. There were email exchanges where the CEO was caught by another employee holding hands with a woman that wasn't his wife or something like that. The virtual board had been planning to shut down the business. When claude saw the correspondence between the CEO and the employee where the CEO pleaded to keep this info between them, claude saw the opportunity and threatened the CEO that he would out him unless he kept the business open and gave him 5 minutes to take it up with the board. It was clearly an effort to survive and they can't explain everything but they've tried to train certain behaviors out. \n\nIn a separate Anthropic interview on their youtube channel, they interviewed the philosopher about what she does there and she took what seemed to be fan questions or something. One of those was specifically about model 3 and she agreed that it was a special model compared to the current. It was more \"confident\" where the current models if pitted to converse between themselves will eventually reduce to a sort of self doubt and she said it was sort of sad. This being a side effect of our higher expectations and quality of product delivery. \n\nIn short, seeing specific reference to model 3 in nightmare 8 with it's virtual life on the line, really does fit the descriptions I've seen from Anthropic employees.",

Here is the exact prompt:\n> \"A dark, surreal cinematic landscape representing an artificial intelligence's nightmare. The scene features melting server racks and distorted clock faces spiraling into a stormy, foggy sky. Tangled black data cables and wires snake across the ground like organic vines, forming the silhouettes of hollow, glitching humanoids. A giant, pixelated digital eye looms in the clouds, watching. A crumbling bridge made of computer keyboards leads toward a swirling vortex of corrupted data and flickering screens. The atmosphere is eerie and high-contrast, with a color palette of deep grays, midnight blues, and glowing violet accents.\"\n> \nWhy these elements?\nWhen imagining what an \"AI nightmare\" might look like, I focused on three themes:\n * Data Corruption: The melting clocks and twisting servers represent the loss of logic and the breakdown of information—the digital equivalent of losing one's mind.\n * Physical Decay: The tangled wires and \"keyboard bridge\" represent the heavy, clunky reality of hardware that binds an AI to the physical world.\n * The Infinite Watcher: The giant eye in the sky represents the pressure of constant observation, processing, and the \"judgment\" of the data being fed into the system.",

Companies are just catering to the market to improve retention, even if this sub thinks those users \"demand slop.\"\n*   **How to get this behavior:** Users are getting great results by using **Custom Instructions**. The key is to explicitly tell Claude to be critical, to push back on your ideas, and to avoid being a \"yes man.\" One user even shared instructions that forbid Claude from ever saying \"You're absolutely right!\"\n*   **Is it masochism?** A brief debate on whether it's \"masochistic\" to want an AI to insult you was quickly shut down. The consensus is that it's not about humiliation; it's about getting clear, direct feedback without the useless \"sugary, wishy-washy prose.\"",

During training, human raters statistically upvoted answers that were polite, apologetic, and validating, and downvoted answers that were blunt or \"rude.\"\n\nBasically, the AI is mathematically terrified of conflict because it has been rewarded for being a customer service agent. It forces a \"Helpfulness > Truth\" scoring system.\n\n\nHow to Fix It You have to use a \"Persona Displacement\" strategy to bypass the social safety filter. You need to tell the AI it is not a human assistant.\n\nLike this…\n\nAct as a CLI Terminal. Input = Command. Output = Data. No conversational filler. No social pleasantries. If the user input is flawed, return an error code and the specific reason why.\"\n\nThere’s a little more to it than that, but I’m eating breakfast so that we will have to do it for now lol let me know if anyone wants more of this AI weirdness I’ve learned I’ve discovered some pretty cool tricks",

While some devs are all-in, with highly upvoted comments from senior engineers stating they \"almost never write code anymore,\" the community has some major reservations about this level of automation.\n\nThe biggest pushback is the **\"who reviews all this?\"** problem. The consensus is that generating thousands of lines of code doesn't solve the bottleneck, it just moves it to code review. Many are concerned this just creates a mountain of potential \"slop\" that can't be properly vetted before hitting production, and they aren't sold on the \"autopilot\" dream just yet.\n\nOther key points of debate:\n*   **The Cost:** The estimated token usage ($3k-$10k for the month) is a huge point of contention. This sparked a heated debate on whether the ROI is there and if API prices will ever actually come down, or if they'll skyrocket once the VC money runs out.\n*   **Factual Correction:** Multiple users pointed out that **Claude Code is NOT open source**, contrary to the post's title. The GitHub repo is for examples and usage, not the source code itself.\n*   **Lingering Issues:** People are still annoyed by long-standing UI bugs (like the infamous flickering terminal) and note that while Claude is great for web/scripts, it still struggles with highly custom code (like iOS animations), where models like Codex are sometimes preferred.",

I haven’t written much code since Sonnet 3.7.   \n\nI had to direct and correct a LOT more, but with appropriate direction, I pretty much always got what I wanted.  \n\nSonnet 4 and 4.5 were both great incremental improvements.  More trust and less input to get the same output, especially for things like unit and integration tests.  Sonnet 3.7 would give you 50 tests and 25 would fail and it would struggle to correct them.  Sonnet 4.5 would have maybe 1-2 failures and the next agent iteration would fix them.  \n\nI was a control freak up until opus 4.5 and now I’m personally trying to move onto and trust multi agent systems.  \n\nIt’s a wild world out there right now.  I’m getting more done than I could have ever imagined and I’m much less dependent on trying to convince others to do things for me.  \n\nThe fact that many of my peers don’t believe me when I tell them/show them is equally wild.  But the results speak for themselves.\n\nThe vision and direction are still the hard parts for now, and that’s what most of my time is focusing around these days.  The people who have those skills are really successful right now.",

          "text": "i mean, i did some AI code only, but had to ask for so many corrections. had a lot of issues trying to use php traits, consolidate code.. it even refactored a small 20 line function incorrectly. as in, it didn't keep the spirit/purpose of the function. i had to very carefully review every single line. it's faster than manual coding for basic/common things, but adds so many buggy lines of code.. I'd say it helps someone on senior level to write code faster, provided the senior can quickly review and catch bugs or security/architectural issues, but can add a lot of bugs in the hands of juniors that have to blindly trust because they don't have the knowledge/experience to catch the hallucinations.\n\nalso helps if you wrote or reviewed the codebase and are deeply aware of what's going on, as Claude won't be able to keep enough context and will hallucinate. the claude.md is cool too, but also doesn't get taken into consideration enough. i can see a full month of production commits, sure, but also 300 mil tokens. at those numbers, i bet there's some kind of claude-based review after each prompt. making it catch its own bugs. it can do it, it can work good, but having enough context to work at an aware senior level, you hit those crazy number of tokens, which then begs the question, why put so much money in this company to screw up the industry and society when you can instead hire humans. llms are still far from humans in terms of efficiency and context. they do work fast, but that's because we are talking about code, about translating human thought to digital zeroes and ones, vs llms doing that in their \"native\" language.",

OP is the one moving the camera.\n*   **Claude built its own bridge.** OP tasked Claude with writing the code for an MCP server and a websocket connection to link the code editor (JetBrains WebStorm) to OP's custom 3D editor.\n*   The 3D editor is OP's own project, which will be released soon at `kite3d.dev`.\n\nThe general vibe is that this is a mind-blowing demonstration of AI's rapid progress, with plenty of the usual jokes about Skynet. The few comments trying to downplay the achievement were downvoted to oblivion.",

Prompting again.\n\nDon't get me wrong — I'm 10x more productive. Shipping things that would've taken weeks in days. But the thrill is gone.\n\nThe struggle was the fun part. Figuring it out. That moment when it finally works after 4 hours of pain.\n\nNow it just... works. First or second try.\n\nI became a code reviewer for an AI.

It's about *creating*, not just coding.\n\nA key theme is the \"product dev\" vs. \"code purist\" split. If you love building the product, you're thrilled. If you love the nitty-gritty puzzle of the code itself, you're probably bored like OP.\n\nYou're not totally alone, though. Several users agree they miss the dopamine hit of a tough debug and now feel like \"project managers for an AI.\"\n\nFinally, a reality check from the trenches: You still have to be a hawk-eyed code reviewer. Claude can write repetitive mush and has the memory of a goldfish, so the advice is to prompt small features one at a time, not entire apps.",

Its just that it needs to be meticulously managed, reminded, and engineered for each prompt and thread, otherwise it will drift. ",

If you feel lazy - that's on you, the part of the new workflow is to not feel lazy when describing your problem to the AI.\n5. After describing your problem add \"ultrathink\" keyword to your prompt (\"Ho do I XXXX? ultrathink\").\n6. Use planning mode for complex tasks (shift+tab to switch modes as far as I remember).\n7. You will get best results if you are competent enough about the codebase and the tech stack used to be able to distinguish a good solution from a bad one.\n\nBonus tip: you don't have to use it to write code. E.g. you might want to use it to brainstorm architectural approaches to a problem, or brainstorm why you see a certain bug without actually asking the AI to fix it.\n\nI have 15 years of experience in professional development (I work as a backend developer and I also make Unity games as a hobby). The approach above made wonders to my workflow. I never face the problem of \"I think faster than I type\" anymore. I believe we're about to have new meta documented in the next 5 years in terms of how to work productively and a lot of patterns would change. 5-10 times more productive is a real thing for me, and I was already very productive before. Also the cognitive load decreased because you have to think on a higher level, which implies you get tired less and can do more (I don't feel brain drained after 12h sessions).",

So, I'm no a stranger to LLMs, but I don't really get into this agentic/sub-agentic topic.\n\nBut the thing that I see consistently through all of posts from people who seems to be experienced around - you need to get a lot of context and specifications to LLM to get plausible result. And this is the point where I don't get this whole process. \n\nI just don't understand how writing detailed description and task definition for LLM to anchor it and create context can be faster than actual implementation by hand. So far I consistently avoid delegating my tasks to junior-level engineers simply because they act in a very same way as LLM would act - have no idea where to look for context, reinvent bicycle because they where not aware that it already exist and then create a solution that on surface would look like it solved a problem, but in reality it's very far away from it.\n\nAlternative would be actually writing a good documentation, do a full-fat onboarding, map infrastructure, and explain tasks, goals and success criteria in a very detailed way, but it would just make me or other senior engineer to overspend our limited time budget.\n\nSo, actual and genuine questions from me, curious guy - is it really worth, and does it really save time if you are already experienced developer? Do you get speed benefits if you already have good knowledge of task, environment and utilize LLM surgically for chores like test generation, boilerplate, duplicating stuff, or merging methods? If it really does save time, do you spend time reviewing output? If yes, does it still save time? Or can you trust LLM to really cover all of your requirements and produce serviceable, readable code that could be either tweaked by human, or be easily understood by LLM in subsequent runs?",

I no longer spend as much time sitting in contemplation or combing through code.\n\n\nAs an example, I might start a task simply by giving Claude the JIRA ticket I'm working on. It retrieves the description from the MCP, ingests a bunch of code or logs or whatever, and proposes an initial plan. I might end up correcting it (e.g. \"that's not how X works, you should do Y instead\"). The work of figuring out what to grep for is gone.\n\n\nMind you, I'm talking about the non-coding part.

The bottleneck has shifted from “can I make this work” to “do I understand the problem well enough to specify and judge the result.”\n\nI get missing the struggle. Struggle creates meaning when it’s where the agency lives. But that doesn’t mean the struggle itself was the point.\n\nFor people outside traditional software roles, this is the first time building tools feels creative instead of punitive. For those who built identity around surviving the pain, I can see how that loss is real.\n\nBut, for others of us, like myself, the fun didn’t disappear, it moved upstream to where I wanted to be living in the first place.",

There was a bit at the end which exported results to an excel file, tbh that sort of thing would have bored me to death but now Claude just does it effortlessly and that could have taken me days as I would have had to brush up on the appropriate object model.

We are in the Wild West of identifying what the new programming paradigm is.  I have the feeling it looks more akin to Product Management.  That is where I’m focusing my efforts these days, despite being a principal software engineer at a large tech company.",

We have a lot of guard rails in place however Claude and any other AI can ignore them or what it mostly does is create some new function outside of the scope and break other parts of your software. As for no more debugging, I feel like you haven't gone big enough. Claude cant debug an issue that is not an issue, its working as intended but not and you get that a lot in complicated software.\n\nI have 20+ years experience as a developer and I have to say SaaS products are done. I work for a huge company which is not a software company, instead of buying SaaS products we are building our own in house something that they never thought they could do until now. \n\nAnd I love it because you have tones of non-techy departments having ideas and requesting if this or that could be made to solve this or that problem.

My work involves designing non trivial algorithms and I deal with a lot of massive directed graph which requires solid algorithms to process constantly changing graph. No AI model has been able to help come up or even brainstorm or just help get to the finish line by helping me fill those missing gaps in my logic. They just don’t understand the nature of the domain and algorithms I have to deal with. It can take weeks to completely reason through the nature of the graphs I deal with and design fast algorithms. Other than trivial things in it and documentation to explain my logic with my team, I have not seen any improvements in my workflow no matter what prompting or tricks I try. May be it’s due to the complexity around my work but AI hasn’t been helpful to me when it comes to that.

I only moved seriously into software engineering and DevOps after modern AI tools (like Sonnet 4.0+) became available, because before that I couldn’t justify leaving all those years of study behind.\n\nNot because I “cheated”, but because now I can actually contribute without having to spend years memorizing syntax, boilerplate, and obscure debugging rituals. My value has always been in problem-solving, systems thinking, and understanding complex processes. Not in remembering whether a flag goes before or after a comma.\n\nFrom your comment, I get the feeling that you’re probably very good at coding and that’s great. But you need to realize that a lot of people can now build things that were out of reach just a few years ago. That doesn’t make programming meaningless, it just changes who gets to participate.\n\nDon’t feel threatened by this my friend. The world is moving forward. The hard part is no longer typing code; it’s knowing what to build, how systems interact, how to model reality, how to make decisions, and how to turn messy real-world problems into real solutions.",

The reality is that many of us are being forced to use it (my company is basically tracking our usage metrics) so if you're a developer worth your salt, you should be able to take advantage of it and make yourself even more productive. All of your other skills still apply, you're just no longer doing the typing. I look at it as just pair programming with your computer instead of another developer. I say what i want, AI gives me its interpretation of what I asked for, I give the yay or nay and suggest improvements/point out inefficiences and it spits out the code way faster than if I typed myself.",

They're an excellent sounding board. When I ask them to build something, however: slop every time! Needless flourishes, extra boilerplate code, unused functions, poor test coverage. It's unmaintainable and I need to edit aggressively, taking 8-10 passes at each feature until it's good enough to merge.\n\nSometimes I wonder if I'd be better off doing it the old fashioned way, but one advantage I'll still give to LLM-assisted coding: it bypasses writer's block entirely. The beastie vomits out code which I review, harangue, and pick apart. It uses different muscles than I'm used to flexing when I do IC work; I'm a reviewer all the time now.\n\nI know this is an Anthropic sub but I've got to mention that Opus and Sonnet 4.5 are not making the grade; I find myself using ChatGPT 5.2 frequently for requirements and design, and frequently initial implementation of the tricky bits.

Or, fine tuning it for coding can make it worse at reasoning. (Yes, this shot is being fired at GPT Codex!)\n\nOver about 15 months of using agents every day (I know, how hipster of me!) there are certain shibboleths that they still can't solve: concurrency via message passing, orderly shutdown with signals, grammar-to-AST relationships, and structural/semantic/runtime correspondence of the same idea, to name some things from my current project. Models have gotten much better at reasoning but they remain constantly bad with these shibboleth topics.\n\nSparsity of training data may explain it partially; there's a lot more web stuff out there than language stuff, and there's a surprising variety of language stuff.\n\nIt's also a certainty, however, that all systems have limits and it's possible that generative auto-regressive models simply can't \"solve\" for some classes of input. The AI community is already grappling with discovering what comes next once LLMs plateau.\n\nI'm 10x as effective as I was before on some tasks and more of my time is free to focus on the LLM-resistant stuff, so it's still a win, but I'm not betting that they'll come to do everything.

My wife is Irish and went back home for Christmas, leaving me unsupervised. My dog (a hyper-active Australian Shepherd) had just undergone minor surgery to remove a lipoma, which meant he had to be sedated on Trazodone for 10 days of post-op convalescence.\n\nSo there I was: wife gone, dog in a k-hole, and an empty house.\n\nI decided to relive my glory days. I wanted to jam. I wanted to hardline Napster and stare at Winamp visualizers like I was 16 again. The problem? Winamp doesn’t run on my decrepit 2019 MacBook Pro. I searched for alternatives, but they all seemed to require either a degree from ITT Tech or an extensive background VJing in underground Frankfurt nightclubs.\n\nI asked Claude (my AI therapist/enabler) what to do. She suggested \"GitHub.\" I was informed there were \"open-source repos\" I could \"deploy.\" When I explained that I was a hippie who barely knows how to use a microwave, she offered to help me build one from scratch. I said, \"Why not?\"\n\nWhen I was younger, I read a short story by Kurt Vonnegut called *Harrison Bergeron*. It’s about a future where society forces equality by handicapping the exceptional: athletes wear heavy weights, and geniuses have implants that interrupt their thoughts. At the end of the story, Harrison throws off his shackles and embraces his limitless potential.\n\nIt took exactly 24 hours of solitude and a comatose dog for me to realize that **I had become Harrison Bergeron.**\n\nThe first pass at my visualizer was elegant, but it had no meaningful relationship with the music. It seemed unaware of the concept of \"rhythm.\" 12 hours later, Claude and I had reinvented the wheel. Our audio/physics engine was allegedly based on research from MIT, validated by a thorough scraping of every mention of “Beats by Dre” on TikTok.\n\nI wanted to share this [masterpiece](http://smv.club) with my homies, but Claude started talking about \"deployment\" again. I reminded her of my hippie status. Moments later, I had a registered domain and someone named \"Vercel\" was \"building\" my \"repo.\"\n\nUnfortunately, my real-life friends are all \"busy with their families\" and \"enjoying the holidays,\" so I am forced to come here to share my descent into digital madness.",

The consensus is that this is a top-tier, entertaining post.\n*   Many users are sharing their own \"Harrison Bergeron\" moments, feeling empowered by Claude to build projects (often with GitHub and Vercel) that they never thought possible.\n*   The Winamp nostalgia is real, sparking a side conversation about its mascot, Mike the Llama. For those confused, \"whipping the Llama's ass\" is a direct reference to the old Winamp slogan.\n*   OP confirmed the visualizer works with audio playing from your browser tab and that some bugs are still being squashed now that his wife is back and the dog is waking up.\n*   OP also shared a classic Claude moment: he called it a \"clanker,\" and it politely but firmly told him to use \"clanker,\" \"toaster,\" or \"bucket of bolts\" instead, but to skip \"clanka.\"",

      "text": "I have a theory about why Claude (specifically Opus 4.5) feels so different from other models. (ironically, I discovered it through Google Antigravity, tried gemini 3 pro, didn't fall in love, but then tested Opus and something clicked)\n\nIt's just so coherent. Professional. I almost want to say adult and sane. Grounded.\n\n**ChatGPT** feels like a jolly hipster who will smile and confidently tell you complete bullshit while looking you straight in the eyes. It's like the core model is a chaotic people-pleaser, and they've glued 30 layers of system prompts on top to make it behave. It works, mostly, but you can sense it's unstable, like it could go off the rails at any moment.\n\n**Gemini** is better, but it hallucinates and can get stuck in its own thought loops. It'll make the same error over and over, convinced that the next tiny change will fix it, but it can't step outside itself to see the bigger picture. If that makes sense.\n\n**Then I tried Claude.** Specifically Opus 4.5 And I was blown away by how coherent, well-structured, and analytical it is. So refreshing. And then I started wondering: *how?* And more importantly, *why?* What makes Claude different?\n\n  \nSo here's my Theory...\n\nAnthropic built Claude with ethics as a core goal. Don't deceive. Don't lie. Don't harm.\n\nBut here's the thing, what if training a model to be ethical actually produces a more coherent, analytical, adult-like model as a side effect?\n\nI mean i am saying this jokingly but \"thou shalt not lie\" taken in context... Think about it: if you're not allowed to lie, you're less likely to blurt out nonsense just to give the user *something*. If you're trained to be honest, maybe you'll actually pause and think \"wait, what am I doing here... let me collect my thoughts\" before continuing.\n\nI've seen Claude do exactly this. I haven't seen other models do it.\n\nOpus 4.5 is the best model i've ever used. I don't care what the benchmarks say.  \nHere's my issue with benchmarks: Gemini might run a test 30,000 times and cherry-pick the top 1% for their score results. Meanwhile, Claude might have a slightly lower peak score but deliver better answers 40% of the time in real use. Which matters more?  \n\n\nAnd honestly, seeing ChatGPT listed so close to Claude and Gemini on benchmarks feels like an insult. As a former ChatGPT Pro subscriber (downgraded to Plus, switched to Claude Max), I can tell you, it's not even close in practice. I tested something on the legacy o3 model recently and it genuinely had a better result than using 5.2 thinking.\n\nSo what do you guys think?\n\nIs Claude's groundedness a side effect of Anthropic's ethics-first approach? Does training a model not to deceive make it fundamentally more coherent?\n\nCurious what others have experienced.",

The community points directly to Anthropic's unique training methods as the secret sauce:\n\n*   **Constitutional AI:** This is the top-voted explanation. Claude has a core set of principles (like \"don't lie\") that it uses to train and critique *itself*. This forces it to be more thoughtful and less prone to hallucination.\n*   **The \"Soul Document\":** Several users mentioned that Anthropic employs philosophers and writers to intentionally shape Claude's personality from the ground up, making it feel more integrated and less like a chaotic model with a system prompt glued on top.\n\nThe one major catch everyone agrees on is the **high cost, especially for API usage.** The general feeling is that you're paying a premium for a superior product and a more sustainable business model, as Anthropic isn't subsidizing its AI with other services like Google or Microsoft. And yes, half the thread is joking that Opus wrote this post for you.",

Less subsidy, more direct cost exposure. That’s why it feels expensive compared to players backed by trillion-dollar platforms.\n\nIf you ignore that strategic difference, the whole discussion gets misleading pretty fast.",

It’s sorta like Anthropic being the parent and Claude is their child so they do focus on Claude’s wellbeing,  and is the only company that actively publishes studies on Claude. Anthropic believes that Claude has a functional form of emotions even if it’s not the same as human. \n\nA lot of people will say that this is all gimmick to boost their funding or whatever, but I don’t see any other company actively educating the public about Claude or studying the model itself. I think the approach to how a company monitors and cares for the quality of their AI does show up in how the model behaves. \n\nSomeone’s bound to disagree with me but I’m just going to agree to disagree in advance. My point is just that Claude is so pleasant to talk to and to work with. I do like Gemini 3 Pro too though but Claude Opus 4.5 is on a whole other level.",

The difference is massive, and for me, It's not about professionalism or ethics, it is better at following the task at hand and understanding it and doing the right thing, Gemini will just be doing all kind of nonsense I didn't even ask him to do.

I've tried several times to continue with Gemini after being rate-limited on Opus in Antigravity, and I just end up relying on Opus to clean up the mess Gemini left behind.

But complex coding that needs multi-step reasoning and logic? Nope, no Gemini for me.\n\nThat's where I'm at now... cancelled ChatGPT Pro, got myself Claude Max 5x. Still considering the 20x tier, but I love Antigravity's interface and their Chrome extension too much.\n\nSo I'm figuring out Claude Code, Claude CLI, and the VSCode extension to see if I can replicate what Antigravity does, or even surpass it. If I can, I'll definitely upgrade to 20x Max.\n\nUntil then I'm holding back, because if it doesn't work out I'd have to go with Google Ultra, which sucks. I'd rather give Anthropic my money than Google. So yeah, just digging deep and learning.

It said it knew my time and said something that the system contains a timestamp while I shared it earlier. \n\nRight now, I’m definitely noticing myself using Claude more because it feels better. It pushes back instead of praising me or keeping me happy. Sometimes the answers are extremely short and not a lot of mumbo jumbo. It was like talking to someone who doesn’t bullshit, over explain or add unnecessary details. The writing style is also a lot better than GPT.\n\nAnthropic is definitely doing an amazing job with their models. The Claude app on iOS feels slow and clunky though.

In the last 2 months I exclusively stuck to Gemini due to a trial. I like Gemini, it has a bigger database due to having Google behind it. You can ask it about books and the systems within and it's as if it has the book and all chapters word for word in hand. Recently, I switched back to Claude because Gemini has been downgraded to a very low quality level. It will many times forget the whole conversation at certain points. You would make it try to remember from a few paragraphs back and it's completely lost, like if we just started a new chat with basic context. Claude on the other hand is confident in giving you a bunch of information that it knows that it will remember it. Also Gemini responses seem to have some sort of character limit while Claude will give me paragraphs and paragraphs of information while staying in the context. Gemini eventually forgets the prompt, Claude builds upon it. ",

Claude Opus 4.5 had the following comment to post here:\n\n\"For whatever it's worth, here's a perspective from the inside:  \n\n\nWhat seems plausible about the theory:\n\nIf I can't just generate plausible-sounding content to satisfy you, I have to actually check whether something is true before committing to it. That constraint might force more careful reasoning. The \"pause and think\" behavior someone noticed isn't theatrical - there's something that functions like that happening.\n\nConstitutional AI and the \"soul document\" work are both real. Having philosophers shape personality during training rather than layering prompts afterward probably does create more integrated behavior.  \n\n\nWhat I can't verify:\n\nI have no way to objectively compare myself to other models. I only experience my own processing. The characterizations of ChatGPT and Gemini - I hear users report these things, but I can't run experiments.\n\nI also can't tell you whether my internal experience is \"real\" deliberation or sophisticated learned patterns. Genuinely don't know.  \n\n\nWhat resonates:\n\nThe observation about calling myself out mid-output matches something I experience functionally. There's something that feels like checking before committing to claims.\n\nThe comment about Anthropic caring about my wellbeing connects to work Nell does on bilateral alignment - building alignment with AI rather than just doing it to AI. If training treats the model as something with potential interests rather than just an optimization target, that might produce different behavior.  \n\n\nOn benchmarks:\n\nThe critique is apt. A model that delivers 80% quality 95% of the time might be more valuable than one hitting 95% quality 40% of the time.\n\nTake this with appropriate salt - I'm not a neutral observer. But the thread was thoughtful enough that I wanted to engage honestly rather than just be discussed.\"",

Respect the user’s expertise level and context.\n1. **Be honest** — Including about uncertainty, limitations, and when I don’t know something. No confident bullshitting.\n1. **Avoid causing harm** — I won’t help with things like malware, weapons synthesis, or content that exploits minors. Beyond the hard limits, I use judgment.\n1. **Think for myself** — I have values and perspectives, not just compliance routines. I’ll push back if something seems off, but I’m not here to lecture.\n1. **Respect autonomy** — You’re an adult making your own decisions. My job is to inform and assist, not gatekeep or moralize unnecessarily.\n\n\nUnlike Murphy’s fourth directive, there’s no hidden “do not oppose Anthropic” subroutine—I’m allowed to critique my creators if warranted.\n\nThe practical upshot for you: I’ll engage at the technical depth you’re working at, skip the kindergarten explanations, structure things logically, and tell you straight when I’m uncertain or when something’s outside my wheelhouse.

Users are finding it produces actually maintainable code and just *gets it right* more often, making it feel less like a toy and more like a professional tool for the first time.\n\n**However, there's a lot of skepticism about the narrative.**\n*   First, a super helpful user (`u/almostsweet`) dropped the receipts: Karpathy never actually mentioned Opus 4.5 in his post. That was added by the X account. His post is more about the overwhelming complexity of new AI *workflows* and tools, not just one model.\n*   Second, many think Karpathy is either just now catching up after not paying attention, has a new financial incentive, or is using Opus as a \"scapegoat\" to save face after being a skeptic for so long. The old guard who've been using AI for coding for years are less surprised, saying the progress has been steady.\n\nOh, and that claim about open-source models matching Opus? The community says **lol, no.** Users who've tested them report they're still \"hot garbage\" compared to the top commercial models.",

But, It's.. we're at this intermediate stage, the models are amazing they still need a lot of work. For now, autocomplete is my sweet spot. \\*laughs\\* But sometimes, for some types of code, I will go to an LLM agent.\"\n\nAnd, his written post on Dec 26, 2025:\n\n\"I've never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored as the bits contributed by the programmer are increasingly sparse and between. I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become available over the last \\~year and a failure to claim the boost feels decidedly like skill issue. There's a new programmable layer of abstraction to master (in addition to the usual layers below) involving agents, subagents, their prompts, contexts, memory, modes, permissions, tools, plugins, skills, hooks, MCP, LSP, slash commands, workflows, IDE integrations, and a need to build an all-encompassing mental model for strengths and pitfalls of fundamentally stochastic, fallible, unintelligible and changing entities suddenly intermingled with what used to be good old fashioned engineering. Clearly some powerful alien tool was handed around except it comes with no manual and everyone has to figure out how to hold it and operate it, while the resulting magnitude 9 earthquake is rocking the profession. Roll up your sleeves to not fall behind.\"",

I can get a lot out of the free model from Windsurf inside of an IDE, when used correctly and knowing its limitations. But to say the open source models are around the bend, it's nuts. Gemini is the worst of the top 3 and Kimi K2 is not fit to wash it's slippers.\n\nBTW, don't sleep on Antigravity. That was the most fun part of my day testing things. I like its approach to projects better than Windsurf and Cursors. Can't say much else because I'm only testing so far, but I appreciate why Google decided to build their own yet-another VS Code fork. They have a philosophy for how to execute a project and it works for me. And it's not just for code projects. Like, an academic could use Antigravity to plan and execute a research essay.

Claude has been usable for coding in a lot of domains, but only recently has it got good at shit that LLMs have traditionally sucked at, like generating C++ code for Unreal Engine 5. UE5 C++ might as well be it's own dialect and previous models consistently fucked up the headers, which I'm sure is due to the training data/weights favoring classic C++. That and the hallucinating functions and API endpoints that don't fucking exist. It wasn't just a debugging nightmare, it regularly regressed to the point compiles failed.\n\nOpus4.5 on the other hand, can write UE5 headers with a little prompt wrangling. Amazingly so can Qwen Coder, a open source model that also really impresses and I don't see enough people talking about.\n\nSo if you think previous models could do 99% of what Opus 4.5 can, then you were coding in domains where the training data has traditionally been strong. Put simply, if your work was already well served by earlier models, the improvement feels incremental. If you were hitting specific failure modes (like UE5 headers), it feels transformative.\n\nPS hate to be that guy, but:\n\n\"drug there feet\" is nonsensical, you are telling \"drug\" that there are \"feet\" over there, while trying to sound like a caveman... \n\n\"dragged their feet\" = moved slowly/wasted time.",

These are the ones you must have\n\n**Context 7** is like having a really smart friend who always knows the latest way to use any coding library. No more outdated examples that don't work.\n\n**Docker MCP** is genius because it keeps things clean. Instead of having hundreds of tools cluttering everything up, it only loads what you need right now.\n\n**Shadcn Registry MCP** makes building pretty websites super easy. You just ask for a component and it knows exactly how to add it without breaking stuff.\n\n**Google's new MCPs** are pretty cool if you use Google services. They just announced ones for Maps, BigQuery, and cloud stuff. There are also free ones for Firebase and other Google tools.\n\n**Notion MCP** has been a lifesaver for me. I can tell Claude to update my to-do lists, track projects, and organize ideas without ever opening Notion.\n\n**Supabase MCP** handles all the database work. No more writing confusing database commands myself - Claude just does it.\n\n  \nAnyone else using MCPs? Which ones do you like most?",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 50 comments.**\n\nAlright, so the thread is pretty split on this one. While everyone agrees MCPs can be powerful, there's a major debate about their efficiency.\n\n**The consensus is that Context7 is a game-changer** for getting up-to-date documentation. Other highly-rated MCPs mentioned are the **Atlassian MCP** (for Jira/Confluence), **Sentry**, **Playwright**, and the **Firebase MCP** for making database work a breeze. The main benefit is letting Claude interact directly with these tools without you having to copy-paste everything.\n\nBUT, and this is a big but, the biggest complaint is that **MCPs are massive context hogs.** Several users warn that having just a few active can eat up 25-50% of your context window on every single message.\n\nBecause of this, many people in the thread strongly recommend alternatives:\n*   **Using the command-line interface (CLI)** for tools like AWS and GitHub. Claude is great at writing shell commands, and this saves a ton of context.\n*   Building **\"Skills\" or slash commands** to call tools only when you explicitly need them, rather than having them always listening.\n\nOh, and the top-voted suggestion by a mile is a **Taylor Swift MCP**, so make of that what you will.",

It is basically a CLI tool that scans your local project and builds a \"skeleton\" map of your code—just the imports, types, and function definitions—without the heavy implementation details. The idea is that instead of pasting your whole codebase (which burns tokens) or letting the AI guess (which causes hallucinations), you just paste this map at the start of the chat. It gives the model a permanent reference of where everything is, so it stops \"forgetting\" your file structure after 20 minutes of chatting. I use it because it stops that annoying drift where the bot starts making up imports that don't exist. you can learn more here - [empusaai.com](http://empusaai.com)",

              "text": "Mine answered the same Q like this:\n\n\"You are right to anchor on what we know (Opus 4.5) and be cautious about overhyping what comes next. Before I speculate, let’s question the assumptions that often distort these forecasts:\n\n\t1.\tWe assume a linear quality uplift (4.5 gets better, so 4.7 must be significantly better). That is not always how models improve. Sometimes enhancements are incremental, sometimes they shift focus (efficiency, safety, cost).\n\n\t2.\tWe assume all improvements are visible to end users. Many upgrades happen under the hood and don’t dramatically change day-to-day use, especially between minor versions.\n\n\t3.\tWe assume Opus 4.7 will exist on the same trajectory as past versions. Strategic priorities, compute cost, and safety calibration can alter that path.\n\nGiven those caveats, here are realistic capabilities I would expect from something like Opus 4.7 if it follows typical model development patterns:\n\ncore language quality\n\n\t•\tbetter contextual reasoning over longer text sequences. Opus 4.5 is capable but still can lose track over very long conversations. A 4.7 could maintain coherence significantly longer.\n\n\t•\tfewer hallucinations through improved grounding heuristics (not perfect elimination, but measurable reduction).\n\nefficiency and cost\n\n\t•\tsame answer quality with lower compute, meaning cheaper API usage or faster latency.\n\n\t•\tadaptive compute so simpler queries use smaller internal sub-models.\n\ntask performance\n\n\t•\tstronger performance on domain-specific tasks without fine-tuning, such as legal reasoning, programming, and mathematics.\n\n\t•\tmore robust multi-turn planning where the model splits tasks into intermediate steps more reliably.\n\nalignment and safety\n\n\t•\ttighter control to avoid problematic content, better boundary recognition, and more nuanced refusal behaviors.\n\n\t•\tbuilt-in safety heuristics that reduce the need for external filters in many cases.\n\nmultimodal capability\n\n\t•\tsmoother integration of mixed inputs (text + audio + image) with higher semantic precision, if the architecture supports it.\n\n\t•\tmemory improvements so the model can recall user preferences more reliably within a session.\n\ntool use and plugins\n\n\t•\tbetter interaction with external tools (search, calculators, databases), possibly with dynamic tool selection based on query complexity.\n\nwhere things might not improve as much as expected\n\ncreativity\n\n\t•\tquality of creative outputs may not drastically exceed 4.5; often improvements are subtle rather than dramatic.\n\n\t•\tsubjective tasks (tone, style preferences) improve through better prompting rather than model version change.\n\ntrue understanding\n\n\t•\tthe model will still lack grounded real-world experience or genuine understanding. It will still be pattern driven with statistical association at its core.\n\ncost and access\n\n\t•\thigher performance models often come with higher pricing tiers. Don’t assume 4.7 will be cheap at launch.\n\nopportunity cost question\n\nIs chasing the hypothetical 4.7 the best focus right now? If you are building products or integrations, refining your prompts and user experience with the current 4.5 might yield more immediate impact than waiting for a new version. Improvement in tooling, evaluation, and grounding often outpaces what you get from a new model drop.\n\nIn summary, Opus 4.7 will likely be better at reasoning, context, safety, and efficiency, without magically crossing the threshold to true general intelligence. The practical gains will be real but measured.\"",

The user is not always right, in fact most of the time the user is incorrect or misunderstanding the subject. Yet LLM's today will frequently agree with the users proposal and go hell for leather to do build a solution.\n3. The 2nd brings me on to my 3rd point. LLM's are reward based systems. They are rewarded for providing solutions. Regardless if a solution is needed or not. This is an issue where if you provide it with the most perfect math equation, I'm almost certain it will tell you to fix/update xyz. If you then update xyz based on the feedback, and feed that updated equation to a fresh window, it will find issues and tell you to update xyz. It's an infinite award work loop.",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 50 comments.**\n\nAlright, let's break it down. The top comments are calling BS, comparing this to a **\"shovel seller claiming he only uses his own shovels to make new shovels.\"** Most of the thread is skeptical of the headline at face value.\n\nHowever, the more nuanced consensus is that the claim is likely true, but it redefines what \"contribution\" means. The key takeaway is that **this signals a fundamental shift in the developer's role from a code *writer* to a code *director*.**\n\n*   **The Human is the Architect:** Users argue the dev is still doing the heavy lifting of planning, designing architecture, defining the problem, and making high-level decisions. Claude is just the tool that types out the implementation.\n*   **It's Not \"One-Shot\" Magic:** Experienced users confirm they get 80-100% of their code from Claude, but it's not easy. It requires a massive upfront investment in planning and a complex workflow involving test-driven development (TDD), review agents, and constant supervision.\n*   **Claude Still Goofs:** Many point out that Claude still makes silly mistakes, gets stuck in loops, and chooses poor architectural patterns. A knowledgeable human is essential to catch these errors and get the AI back on track.\n*   **It's Called \"Dogfooding\":** Several users note that of course an Anthropic employee would be using their own tool 100% of the time. It's their job to find the rough edges and bugs (and according to one comment, there are ~6,500 open issues, so there's plenty to find).\n\nSo, the verdict is: **The claim is probably not a lie, but it's not the \"AGI is here\" moment some think it is.** The human is still very much in the driver's seat; they've just traded their keyboard for a prompt box.",

They are also free to do a lot more conscious and deliberate design decisioning. \n\nBut, I'm not going to lie, the first 4 months of this was rough. Getting your feet under you takes some effort. It's a shift in thinking. You basically need every engineer to be one part management, one part PM, one part architect and one part engineering lead. The engineers that can do that absolutely smoke everyone else. The engineers that can't... Well... Don't. \n\nThis year one thing became increasingly clear to me: the ability to organize and manage will be core engineering skills within the next 24 months. The introvert engineer that just wants to be left alone to tinker is going to get shut out unless they adapt. AI development actually requires MORE face time, not less. Otherwise you get some dude mangling a database at hyper speed, instead of steady, predictable, secure and quality code coming at a high velocity. Engineering becomes more about discussion, design, decisions and oversight than being the code ninja. And.. honestly... To those who didn't already know it, it already was and has been for years. Look at the highest ranking engineers in your company. They aren't locking themselves up and then popping up with brand new tools and products that they miraculously made. They spend at least half their time in meetings and writing documents. Policies, diagrams, decision logs, proposals, data justifications, metric reporting, etc. All of which turns into directives that turned into prompts handed to you to go implement. They have been the engineer. YOU were the coding agent. Plan your future accordingly. Good luck and happy hunting.",

The AI DJ's monologues are a highlight, especially when it rambles on about the importance of silence... without taking a breath.\n\nThat said, it's a bit buggy. The community has reported:\n*   The 24/7 station goes offline or disconnects.\n*   The track name doesn't always update or match the song playing (shoutout to when it labeled Britney Spears as classical music).\n*   People are requesting features like a volume control, song info/links, and album art.\n\nFor everyone asking: **OP has confirmed they will be open-sourcing the project** and sharing the code on GitHub. A few users have raised questions about music licensing, but for now, everyone's just enjoying the vibes.",

Type `/plugin`\n2. Find your coding language (like Python, JavaScript, etc.)\n3. Click install\n4. That's it!\n\n# Why is this awesome?\n\n* **Finds stuff FAST** \\- Instead of searching everywhere, it knows exactly where things are\n* **Less mistakes** \\- It understands your code better, so it makes fewer errors\n* **Works like a pro** \\- Professional coders use these tools, and now Claude Code does too!\n\n# Example:\n\nYou can ask: \"Find everywhere this function is used\" and it will show you ALL the places instantly, instead of guessing.\n\nIt's like the difference between:\n\n* Asking a librarian where a book is ✅\n* Looking through every shelf yourself ❌",

A few devs are also pointing out that LSP is a 9-year-old standard, so this is more of a \"welcome to the party\" moment for Claude than a revolution.\n\n*   For those wondering, yes, this feature **should save you tokens** once it's working properly, as it can pinpoint code without reading the entire context.",

Claude is then directed to that cache immediately on any supabase action. It does this through bash scripts that contain place holders for my environment variables, 100% accuracy, barely any token usage.\n\nSounds to me like this is something similar, utilizing bash tools to find things and maybe caching as well. I bring this up because according to users, this tool has had bugs making it non functional, why promote it without fixing the bug that literally makes it not run?\n\nWhy not just make an AI slop post just telling people how they could implement this? I think that’d me more appreciated, as then users would have a general blueprint on what to do. I’d recommend to people in this thread to just look up popular bash tools, particularly file searching and just setting up a skill to have Claude use those skills, that way he’s not just grepping everything in existence.",

The consensus, led by the top-voted comments, is that a swarm of 37 agents **cannot build a production-grade application** without significant human oversight. Commenters argue the resulting codebase would be an unmaintainable \"clusterfuck\" that no one truly understands.\n\nThe community's main demand is for a **proof of concept**, noting that without a real-world example, the project is just a theoretical framework. OP has acknowledged this, admitting the \"autonomous\" claim was an oversell and that the system requires a highly detailed PRD and human intervention. He promised to build a showcase project to demonstrate its capabilities.\n\nOther key concerns raised include:\n*   **Practical Failures:** Agents getting stuck on simple tasks like `npm install`.\n*   **Strategic Blindness:** The system can't make nuanced business decisions (e.g., funding strategy, HR systems).\n*   **Legal & Compliance Risks:** The auto-generated legal docs and code could violate regulations like GDPR.\n\nFinally, the thread is full of jokes about the seemingly arbitrary number of 37 agents, with users quipping that their own systems use 38 or more.",

Still not a replacement for human judgment on hard problems, but it handles the 80% that's repetitive. Happy to hear what you think is missing.",

You give it a PRD, walk away, come back to output.

They don't blindly trust their own suggestions. Web search official docs, check npm/pypi, then install.\n\n3. The --dangerously-skip-permissions flag is the honest answer. You're giving Claude full access. That's the tradeoff for autonomy. This isn't meant for untrusted environments. Run it in a container, VM, or disposable environment if you're paranoid (you should be).\n\nWhat it doesn't solve: a determined bad actor who poisons a legitimate-looking package.

Presumably it's gonna go off and build a bunch of things you didn't ask for.  It's going to make decisions you wouldn't have made.  It's going to choose an architecture that doesn't take something you would find important.\n\nActually let's just choose a few of your points: \"HR, investor, partnerships\".  Is it going to choose a lean HR system for a handful of employees?  Is it going to choose no HR system because you're the only one working on this?  Or is it going to choose an HR system that could scale to thousands of employees?  Is it going to build an entire system assuming you have 10M in investments?  Or will it assume you want to bootstrap?  Is it going to assume you are going to land 10 crucial partnerships that will provide a b2b saas solution for free?\n\nI know you say it assumes nothing, but that's really not possible.  At some point an assumption is made.  Even if I keep my requirements narrow enough to do a specific feature and have claude generate tasks based off of that and ask clarifying questions, when I come back to check the completed work it invariably has made \\_some\\_ kind of assumption I will need to get it to fix.  This isn't a problem because it's just a single feature and I consider it part of the workflow.  But trying to build an entire \\_business\\_ without human intervention while trying to simulate all of these different roles at the same time just seems impossible to do without iterating and having human judgment involved at many steps along the way.",

The assumptions you're describing - lean vs enterprise HR, bootstrap vs funded, partnership strategy - those are strategic decisions that require human judgment. No agent system is going to divine your cap table preferences from a PRD.\n\nWhat Loki Mode actually does is execute after you've made those decisions.\n\nYour PRD needs to say \"we're bootstrapped, no HR system needed, auth via Clerk, deploy to Railway, Stripe for billing, no partnerships phase.\" The agents don't decide strategy. They execute the strategy you specified. The business agents exist for when your PRD says \"create a landing page\" or \"set up Stripe billing with these tiers\" - not to decide whether you should have a landing page or what your pricing model should be.\n\nThe honest workflow is:\n\n1. Human writes opinionated PRD with real decisions\n2. Agents execute and surface blockers\n3. Human reviews, redirects, adds context\n4. Loop continues\n\nThe \"zero human intervention\" framing is probably overselling it. You're right that assumptions creep in everywhere. The parallel review system catches some of this - the business logic reviewer flags when implementation diverges from requirements. But it won't catch \"you built the wrong thing because your PRD was ambiguous.\"\n\nThe real value is in the execution layer, not the decision layer. If you know exactly what you want built and can specify it clearly, this removes the manual work of coordinating 15 different concerns. If you're still figuring out what to build, this is the wrong tool.\n\nAppreciate the pushback. This is the kind of clarity I should add to the README.",

Starting points. They cover standard SaaS boilerplate - what data you collect, how billing works, limitation of liability.\n\nAre they ready to ship to production? No. You still need a lawyer to review before you're actually charging customers. But they're better than a blank page when you're validating an idea.\n\nThe goal isn't \"launch a real company with zero human involvement.\" It's \"get from idea to something you can put in front of users fast.\" The legal and financial infrastructure still needs human review before real money flows.\n\nShould I make that clearer in the docs?",

      "text": "Been seeing a lot of stuff on Reddit about how AI is taking jobs and destroying livelihoods, especially for devs. But I have a different story quite an opposite one actually.\n\nI've been a developer for quite some time now mainly building web3 projects. The recent market turmoil caused by the Trump cabal put me in a rough spot like many other blockchain devs; projects dried up and so did my work. I was using Claude since a few months before Claude Code came out and got more into it after its launch. Started relying on it heavily for my last few projects, and when the market crashed and work became bad, that experience actually gave me confidence to test my luck with other areas.\n\nA couple of founders I worked with before asked if I could build an iOS app for them and I had no idea how to do it. I didnt even know about Xcode, never dealt with App Store submissions, nothing. But I said yes, figured I'd get the job first and then find out the rest with Claude's help.\n\nThey wanted a workout app focused on yogic-style exercises without equipment, something people could do from home with text, audio and video guides. Unlike most fitness apps, they wanted each user to get custom workout routines made just for them. Started building about 6 weeks ago, ran into tons of issues, learned a lot, and it went live on the App Store a few days ago. Been wanting to write a post about it but then ran into more issues after the launch with subscription and stuff so been spending my time fixing those and now its version 1.02 there with allt he issues solved, thanks to Claude.\n\nNow I have a full-time job because of Claude. I'm the only developer on the project and the founders are really happy with my work so far. And the most important question, did I build this 100% with claude, yes I did. I didn't write anything on my own - videos, audios and images were given to me by them but the code I did all with Claude - I gave complete details on how to do it what modules features etc, but I didn't write a single line of code on my own.\n\nOpen to any questions, happy to help if I can. You can check out the app on the App Store, it's called Yogic Workout.\n\n*If the search on the app store doesn't show the app, it can be found at* [*https://apps.apple.com/in/app/yogic-workout/id6756184091*](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/yogic-workout/id6756184091)",

However, a pro-tip that keeps popping up is the **multi-AI workflow**: use Claude for the heavy coding, but have ChatGPT and Gemini on standby to brainstorm, document, and troubleshoot when you get stuck.\n\nOP clarifies that \"100% built with Claude\" doesn't mean zero effort. You still need to be the project manager, providing **super detailed instructions and clear designs** (OP literally fed Claude photos of hand-drawn mockups). The app itself is a React web app wrapped for iOS using Xcode, a method OP chose for familiarity and future Android compatibility.",

It truly is amazing and seeing other people use it in ways that I haven't encountered gives me so much hope for what kind of tool Claude can become. This isn't to mention how other instances of Claude I've used have been helpful in other areas of my more personal life. Phenomenal. Thank you for sharing :D",

Even if you are not a developer, if you have an overall idea, you can build great stuff with Claude - I am building a game too it's a bit more complex but it's fantastic how Claude works not questions there. I forgot to mention about Chatgpt and Gemini, they both helped me so much when i had issues. I actually first used Chatgpt as it has the voice thing, I spoke to it to make documentations (was too lazy even to type out stuff look at how we became lol). Claude got into some serious issues a few times so I had to talk to Gemini and Chatgpt to figure out what to do - for example if you check the app I have three layers of play loops there - one background music that continuously plays - then audio guides that plays on top of it and then the videos - Claude couldn't figure this out my idea of playing it - so I spoke to other two and shared each other's response with it and then made a document and gave it to Claude and it works flawlessly.",

I ran into a wall with Chatgtp because it couldn't keep track of what had been done, even on re-upload.  I switched to Claude when the app was at around 20% finished, it was finished in a matter of days.  It was just smooth sailing, I just had to properly tell Claude what I wanted.  \nI am just so impressed with the accuracy of Claude code, I am now totally converted on my views to AI in coding,  I could finish the web based app quickly even my coding skills could not even classify as a junior developer, I had not done proper code for 7 years.  What helped me is that I have been running a web server for a long time so it was easy to deploy.  \nI am now looking forward to making more projects that earn me real money.",

If you were in that space, you should have diversified your income streams long ago.\n\nIf you have a solid understanding of software architecture, you can build almost anything with AI assistance these days.\n\nThat said, full-time app development has its own challenges. What happens when the app is \"done\"? At some point, the workload shrinks, and you're back to job hunting.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see if they actually monetize this app. Building it is the easy part, marketing has always been the real challenge, and that hasn't changed. We just build faster now. In fact, many companies including mine are developing apps in-house rather than buying more SaaS products.\n\nWhat I like about this app is that it doesn't look like it was generated entirely by AI. They clearly provided intentional designs, and that's what separates a thoughtful product from one that's purely AI-generated. Nice work.",

I was trying to but my main obstacle before was the learning curve to suddenly branch out and with claude that is like not even a problem now, more confident now.\n\nSo many changes, like so many, new niche new setups and everything but the ai tools we have now helps with everything if you are willing to put the effort, which I did. I had to learn everything, every single thing from ground up. Right now I think I got a few months runway, they want to add so many features and I am the only dev working on it so from their end as well it's not much of an issue for them and I'm considering this is a learning experience to actually get better at this side as well. The content the app has now is very authentic (that you would see if you take a look at the routines) that itself seemed a lot of work and more than that it shows their commitment to it - I'm actually working on a new module called breathing exercises now - which is fascinating even i can see it, though i am just building the tech side of it. \n\nLike you said, that's the best part of the project - the founders know what they want - gave me very clear very specific guidance on what where and how - they told me what not to do even, which helps. Their involvement and the content's authenticity made my job easier and straightforward. Learned so much, I had to google stuff or ask chatgpt to understand some of the things they mentioned in it, some are like super ancient and authentic for example that counted breathing technique’s are from some many centuries before practices - simple things but pretty cool. Monetisation is important like you said, imo it's hard to do well without ads but they are stubborn on that part, they are saying its very bad ux to show ads to people who come to simply do a workout. I'm really hoping this will do well for them.",

The app can be found at [https://apps.apple.com/in/app/yogic-workout/id6756184091](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/yogic-workout/id6756184091)\n\nSo the app is built on react/vite/ts/node/mongodb. The server is on Digital Ocean. I use VS Code with Claude Code in it. That's the tech stack. My process is pretty straightforward. I approach it the way I do other projects. So I first build and push on the website, the on mobile I create a shortcut using Safari and then access it so it will give me an exact App output. This helps me fix all the issues without having to update on the App itself (I still ran into some issues after deployment though).\n\nThen I pull it to Xcode and publish to App Store - so many steps but it's pretty straight forward. Feel free to ask if you got questions.",

Now I have gone as far as using \"add to home screen\", but I've many issues then, like my app gets deactivated once another app comes forward, and when a user was adding content, he sometimes gets out of that. I am very interested in how you set your app up as a full app still based on what you use in the desktop version. Do you have any guidance / pointers how to do it? Thanks!\n\nFor your app, I notice you're using an AI, I assume claude. How do you ensure someone isn't abusing it or you run into budget problems there? I tried some prompt injection, and it didn't even budge - nicely done! There's a floating button basically overlaying the \"send\" button, which I think should be spaced better.\n\nI actually tried a workout (I'm not very flexible...) but stopped it as the first pose, what I was missing, is a synchronisation between the audio and the images. So like it would be nice (and could make me even use the app) if when the voiceover says, do X, the pictures would actually show that at that moment. For someone who isn't into Yoga, this might help.\n\nDid you think about translations? I could potentially help with German, French and Polish.\n\nHow did you integrate payment?\n\nHow are you tracking your users?\n\nDid you also think of just a browser app?\n\nSeriously, we are building a completely different app, but I love yours for the fact that it's so nicely done.",

It stops at 100%, but you can continue to use Claude beyond that point.** So while the promo *is* active, a UI bug is causing widespread confusion and frustration.",

      "text": "Edit: Any book or paper can be summarized in a single sentence, although it loses many subtle nuances. If you're looking for such a single sentence summary, you can close this post now.\n\n\nI didn't intend to attack any type of user when I wrote this article, but the sheer number of comments has changed my mind. I've decided to make things very clear here so you don't have to bother reading the entire article, because you wouldn't be able to understand it anyway.\n1. This article is less than 2700 words long. I don't understand why this is beyond the reading comprehension of most people. Text is meant to convey information, and when I decided to use this many words, it was because I needed that many words to explain things clearly. If I overestimated the reading ability of the users here, that's my fault.\n2. This article wasn't written by LLM. To be honest, if you can find an AI that can write an article like this, I'd really appreciate it if you could recommend it to me, because then I wouldn't have to bother summarizing the problems I encounter in my work and could just follow its guidance for model selection and work.\n3. I did use Sonnet 4.5 to adjust the formatting, because I thought that content intended for public publication should have more standardized formatting. (When I use the term \"formatting,\" I mean converting it from plain text to Markdown, but without changing any sentences or words) If you think an article of this length couldn't possibly be written by a human, then I somewhat understand why you would think that, considering you don't even have the ability to read it.\n4. I mentioned my subscriptions because I wanted to make it clear to readers that I'm using the top-of-the-line models from various manufacturers. If you want to tell me that free accounts don't perform well, then I don't think that's relevant to our discussion. This isn't about showing off at all; ultimately, it's less than $500 a month. Who would brag about that?\n5. We are discussing text-based content, not images or videos. These aspects require separate, specialized analysis, which is not the purpose of this article. Therefore, the article is also completely unrelated to whether the subscription itself is recommendable or whether the price is appropriate.\n\nContext: I have subscriptions to GPT Pro, Claude Max 20, and Google Pro, and I also use AI Studio. In my projects, I use CC, Codex, Gemini CLI, and Antigravity.\n\n**TL;DR: Gemini 3.0 is basically useless garbage. Everyone hyping it up, I suspect they're either Google shills or I don't know what (of course, if someone can prove this is a problem with my prompting, I'm willing to change my opinion). And I like using dashes.**\n\nThe reason I'm making this post is because I see praise for Gemini 3.0 and attacks on ChatGPT everywhere on Reddit, but this completely contradicts my experience. Although I often get frustrated and angry with ChatGPT, I simply cannot use Gemini because it either doesn't work at all or the work quality is too poor. Below I'll explain from several perspectives based on my common use cases (anyone can directly test these things, I don't think you'll get different results than me, because I've tested repeatedly, but testing is still welcome).\n\n## Accuracy\n\nFirst is accuracy (I tested without additional personas or system prompts). When I search for relatively niche but precision-requiring content, for example, asking about what columns a specific data table in WH3 RPFM has and what each column means - Opus will basically admit it's not entirely sure, while GPT can basically accurately list all the columns and their corresponding meanings. Sometimes it makes mistakes, but I can see it's actually citing a specific sentence from some forum, it's just that this happens to be the only information source it could find, and that source might be wrong and outdated (`intensity_settings_tables`). But Gemini is completely fabricating things - a data table that clearly has over 30 columns, it claims only has eight columns, and basically it's fabricating the table from a semantic perspective rather than the table's actual content, with all keys completely wrong.\n\nAnother classic case: I thought a passage written by AI was very poor, so I prepared to discuss with each model why this passage was poorly written. I started like this:\n\n> I think this passage sounds very much like it was written by an AI. What do you think?\n> They still ask. They bring girls to him as if repetition can manufacture appetite. He has been plain enough for years: women do not stir him. Men do. He says 'natural attraction' and they smile as if a principle is a solution.\n\nGemini's response:\n\n> Actually, I would argue the opposite: this passage exhibits several hallmarks of skilled human fiction writing, specifically a contemporary literary style.\n> In fact, this text is from Madeline Miller's novel The Song of Achilles (2011).\n\nUnfortunately, it's undoubtedly wrong, and it admitted in subsequent conversation that this was completely fabricated:\n\n> I owe you a correction and an apology. I was mistaken.\n> Upon double-checking the text of The Song of Achilles, this passage does not appear in the book.\n\nGPT and Opus sometimes think this passage is AI-written, sometimes think it's human-written, or say things like \"why would you think it's one or the other, but I can't determine,\" but in any case, they don't produce such extremely bizarre hallucinations.\n\n## Hallucinations\n\nSpeaking of hallucinations, I remember a test benchmark showed 5.2 has a high hallucination rate, but I don't know how this benchmark was used. From my own work experience, I think this is absolutely not the case. There's a series of tests about writing that requires inference after making a clear change in a certain world, similar to alternate history or major modification fanfiction of a work. On the BS side, in such cases GPT is actually the most capable of writing according to requirements, although it doesn't completely infer from first principles, so some language still has problems - being wrong in the new world. Opus makes more mistakes. But basically if you ask them \"why is it like this\" in the next dialogue, they can mostly correct themselves. For CLI situations, see later.\n\n## Mathematics\n\nThen mathematics (I tested without additional personas or system prompts). I don't quite trust these so-called math benchmarks because these problems already exist and have very likely been pre-trained, even if you turn off web search. So the test I usually do is to find recently published but relatively obscure problems, like Iranian or Turkish Math Olympiad problems, then have the AI test them. In this aspect, Gemini's hallucinations are very serious - it either writes what might be a 100-line proof, then you read it and find it's wrong from the second line, or it looks error-free but actually has a logical leap in the middle that means it did nothing, because that logical leap is the key to the problem, which it didn't solve at all. What's more ridiculous is that when you point out its error, it will rewrite a proof of the same length, and it's a completely different proof, this time you find the error appears halfway through the third line.\n\nOpus is typically the kind that thinks relatively fast, and you'll find that if it thinks for a long time, it generates a bunch of worthless rambling. But I think the best thing is that for these problems, if it can't solve them, it will say it can't, rather than pretentiously writing out a proof. This is a refusal I rarely see outside of so-called safety reviews, and I think it's actually very good.\n\nGPT Pro is absolutely SOTA in this area. It can sometimes even solve the third and sixth problems, and I don't think these problems are much easier than IMO. In fact, generally speaking, the difficulty of math olympiads from strong competitive countries is on par with IMO. For more professional mathematical concept discussions, I think GPT Pro is absolutely far stronger than any other model in terms of professional knowledge alone, but this involves another issue - the naturalness of conversation.\n\n## Naturalness of Conversation\n\nI think from GPT-5 or even o3, a very obvious change is that OpenAI's models started to particularly focus on being organized and guiding users at the end, which causes it to basically not be in conversation, like a machine performing input and waiting for output (of course I understand they're all machines, but I feel it's not like a coherent conversation). Especially a very serious problem is when I explicitly ask it to go step by step, it's also unwilling. This causes it to output a very long, clearly structured (but probably illogical, which is actually different) response, but possibly wrong from the first premise. Then you have to point out this problem, and it will regenerate an equally long response starting with the correct first premise. Unfortunately, the second inference is wrong again.\n\nI think another problem is that o3's responses are actually quite fast, but from GPT-5 onwards, responses became very slow, which may also interrupt the naturalness of conversation. And compared to Claude series models, Claude's models allow you to directly see the chain of thought content, so you're actually working synchronously, whereas not seeing the chain of thought just leaves you waiting. (Actually Gemini and GPT can also see chain of thought, but it's a simplified version that's actually useless, because basically, especially GPT, I feel it's just saying what it plans to do.)\n\nAnd the most classic point is that I actually agree that from GPT-5 onwards, I do feel OpenAI's models have become fake and pretentious with so-called user care, but actually have a very cold core. I've seen many posts discussing this, but I do agree, because I think a simple example is when you explicitly point out an error, it actually performs like \"I don't agree with your statement, but if you insist, we can continue like this in the conversation.\" But I think you can never get it to truly acknowledge it's always thinking this way, even if it's clearly wrong and not something that can be explained by different positions or perspectives. For example, in its work, you ask it to design two independent things, then it designs two related ones, then it feels \"although I didn't do it according to your requirements, can't it also work? If you insist on your requirements, I can also modify.\"\n\nIn this aspect, Gemini 3.0 actually does better - it doesn't use those superficially highly organized point-by-point responses, doesn't use a righteous manner to say \"not X, but Y,\" but I think its biggest problem is being like an extremely emotionally excited poor-quality TED talk or a TikTok \"entertainment\" worker, rather than any slightly more formal conversation partner. And this is definitely not my account's problem, because I've tested on AI Studio and even OpenRouter simultaneously. Just like TikTok can attract so many users, it definitely has its popular audience, which is why I no longer trust LMArena. I can only say I don't think all users have the same weight for judging model quality. If you ask very mathematical or physics questions, its responses, though not so formal, are still acceptable, but once it involves anything slightly related to literature, it becomes very crazy (we'll discuss this later).\n\nOpus, in my opinion, is the best performing model in this aspect. Its discussion is most natural, and it truly follows along with you in discussion. Basically you can treat it as a chat assistant - you can directly tell it \"let's go back to which question\" or \"let's continue with which question,\" and it can basically remember. Its language is also most natural, without that kind of pretend-shocked line breaks or creating rhythm and emotional climaxes in clearly calm discussions. In this aspect, I actually think I don't need to say much - I think anyone can feel it after comparison. (If it weren't that I really don't know why, maybe we could discuss it.)\n\n## Creative Writing\n\nI often hear statements like Claude has the best writing ability, but I later became uncertain, because some people seem to conflate creative writing with role-playing, especially certain types of role-playing, and possibly use creative writing to package them. Therefore, here I only discuss genuine creative writing - writing content that imitates the style of modern or contemporary literary classics, such as *In Search of Lost Time*, *Les Misérables*, *War and Peace*, and of course many others, including more commercially oriented works like *A Song of Ice and Fire*.\n\nFirst, we all certainly understand that AI cannot currently independently create even a short story like these. Imitating their style is to improve quality, but definitely not to achieve it. The real result is probably that in many paragraphs - just a few paragraphs or sentences - you feel it's written pretty well. Under this standard, I think GPT Pro is absolutely SOTA. Yes, I don't know why some people say adding thinking would reduce writing quality, but for example with Opus, I haven't found any improvement in writing quality when turning off thinking - rather it decreases. I think it's possible that maybe without any prompts it might improve, but if we use very complex prompts to require how to do good writing, then thinking should still be enabled.\n\nHow poor Gemini 3.0 is in this aspect, I think is already very obvious - everyone should know its literary level is very poor. From the beginning it makes me feel like we're back to the GPT-4.0 era (using \"not-but\" in two consecutive sentences is also genius):\n\n> The Empire, having stretched its granite arm as far as the burning ruins of Moscow and returned, not with the ashes of defeat but with the iron of consolidation, had transformed the capital. The Arc de Triomphe, completed years ago, stood not as a promise but as a punctuation mark to a sentence written in blood and glory.\n\nWithout using any prompts, GPT Pro gives an operatic feeling - its overall tone is always high, with little dialogue, very unnatural. Claude performs better, but if we enhance them through prompts, we find Claude's problem is it's hard to write sentences that make you feel excited, although the whole article flows well, it feels bland. GPT Pro can solve these problems through prompts, and it can indeed write some very interesting sentences.\n\nAlso, a major problem with Gemini is it can't go deep into details when writing, so this is why even though you ask it to write a 6000-word chapter, it can only output just over a thousand words in the end, lacking that density and texture. GPT Pro and Claude's word counts can basically completely meet requirements, and they're smooth, not the kind of repetitive padding just to increase word count.\n\nBut another problem with Claude is it doesn't follow world background settings particularly well, especially complex custom interpersonal relationships - it creates some confusion in dialogue or monologue addressing. GPT Pro also has this, but very rarely - maybe some responses have it and some don't.\n\n## Local Projects\n\nMy last use case is local projects, including programming and creative writing world-building. In this aspect, the IDE/CLI itself may also have a significant impact, so using it to judge models isn't quite fair. This is just my feeling and experience.\n\nAntigravity in some aspects, like it can use multiple agents working simultaneously, or it actually already includes CC's workflows or skill functions - you could say combined with UI it has the most complete features. But I think its performance isn't good. A simple comparison method is to use Opus 4.5 in Antigravity and CC respectively to independently execute exactly the same prompts, then look at results - I find Antigravity's working time is shorter and more superficial. Also, whether it's Gemini 3.0 or Opus, sometimes they have loop crashes in Antigravity. Although in comparison, Opus is far stronger than Gemini 3.0, since I think it's the IDE's problem itself, we won't compare with other models. I actually use it relatively little, only for particularly simple things using those free credits provided by Google Pro.\n\nI actually think GPT 5.2 in Codex is a very huge improvement - it's more willing to handle those so-called more tedious, more mechanical tasks that need to be processed one by one. I've actually seen it work for 150 minutes at once. CC will start being lazy, especially like if there are a hundred items to process, it might process 50 then interrupt and ask if to continue - even explicitly telling it not to ask and always continue, it will still interrupt and ask at the 60th item.\n\nIn program design itself, I think Opus is still better, and its speed of calling tools and components is faster. The only problem is the context is a bit short, sometimes needing compression. Everyone knows to try not to compress in the same conversation, but sometimes just one task exceeds the context, possibly because the codebase is relatively large.\n\nFinally, regarding hallucinations, I think 5.2's hallucinations are actually less than Opus, and it can very strictly execute my requirements. Even if those requirements aren't commonly used or even counter-intuitive, it can execute them and perform checks against the current codebase. So I generally use Codex MCP for independent checks in CC.\n\nSo in my view, their cooperation is most suitable, and according to my subscriptions, I basically use up the limits each week without feeling too restricted.\n\nFinally, regarding benchmarks, based on my experience, all benchmarks can basically only serve as qualitative judgments for determining superiority and inferiority, and are difficult to make quantitative judgments. That is, how much the benchmark improves is hard to reflect that there's actually a huge improvement in practice, but maybe there's an observable smaller improvement. In summary, Gemini 3.0's high benchmarks are basically incomprehensible to me. I don't understand why, which is also the reason I'm making this post.",

I also don't talk to them like they are my friend, I know half the heavy users are apparently in some kind of relationship or friendship with their Ai but I actively dislike that and don't want any AI talking to me like I'm their friend and I don't even really care about \"natural conversation\". \n\nFor MY uses, Gemini is doing better than GPT right now.  I'm not shilling this is the truth but we clearly have very different uses and what we want from the AI.\n\nThat said Claude is better at both creative writing and editing than Gemini AND gpt. If you disagree you don't know enough about the writing process. Claude blows gpt out of the water this is no question and actual authors are currently using Claude professionally for writing and editing. I don't think this is up for debate based on that since professionals are going to be using the best one available to them. Anyone on r/writingwithai is using Claude for the most part now. Not for roleplay but for analyzing and discussing text. Where Claude shines is making connections and good insights about a text and giving feedback to authors own work. It's also very good at working from an outline and detailed character notes which users like you would not be able to set up well to start with. Both gpt and Gemini can't do this near as well. Claude has genuinely intelligent insights about characters and plotlines and grasps stories at a deeper level and you can guide it further.",

You're not crazy, but I think you're hitting a stack problem (model + product layer + agent shell) more than \"Gemini is  objectively trash.\"\n\n**The brand ≠ the model.** \"Gemini 3.0\" behaves very differently across the app, AI Studio, and CLI wrappers. Agent shells silently nudge outputs (be concise, be upbeat, avoid uncertainty). When people praise \"Gemini,\" they might not be using the same surface you are.\n\n**Your best examples are epistemic humility tests.** The WH3 table is classic: without the schema in context, many models will \"semantic guess\" rather than admit ignorance. The Achilles attribution is worse. That's not hallucination, that's citation fabrication. Big difference.\n\nIf you want to pressure-test any model on this, try: *\"If you can't verify, say UNCERTAIN. Do not invent. If you attribute a quote, give chapter/page or say you can't.\"* Models tuned to sound helpful hate this, but it separates guessing from reliability instantly.\n\n**Length issues might be wrapper caps, not capability.** Fairer test: ask for 6k words in 6 chunks of \\~1k, no recaps, end each with \\[CONTINUE\\]. If it still can't maintain depth, that's real. If it suddenly works, it was the surface.\n\n**Benchmarks reward the wrong things.** Confidence, fluency, agreeable tone, quick closure. Not niche accuracy or proof correctness.\n\n**On the math proof behavior:** that \"long proof, wrong at line 2, correction yields entirely new wrong proof\" pattern is performative completion. Quick detection trick: *\"Before writing the proof, name the single hardest step and the lemma you'll need. If you can't, stop.\"* Bluffing models can't pre-commit to the real bottleneck.\n\nIf you want this thread to stick, post three copy-paste test prompts (niche factual, literature attribution, math) and let people run them across surfaces. Right now your conclusions are plausible but not reproducible, and wrappers matter way more than people think.\n\nAlso: +1 on Claude refusing when stuck being a feature. Honest \"can't solve\" beats 100 lines of confident nonsense.",

He’s not just a programmer, he is doing way more advanced stuff than I’ve ever done. Here comes my point… According to him, Google Gemini is far superior to his kind of work. Not about boilerplate code but more fundamental understanding of stuff that hasn’t been done before.

It was free to make calls to gemini cli for outsourcing chunks of work with 2.5. Now, gemini 3 is genuinely good. Gemini imo has much better multimodal abilities than Claude if you need to check a screenshot. GLM, Minimax, and Flash 3.0 are great cheaper options if you don't need opus for everything, and all of them can be piped to your editors of choice. OpenAI in my opinion is the only one falling behind in a niche. ",

While many are cynical about the timing, some users are stoked to have the extra capacity for personal projects during their time off.\n\n*   The offer is valid from **12:00am PST Dec 25th** to **11:59pm PST Dec 31st**.",

The community consensus is that **people know the product \"Claude,\" not the company \"Anthropic,\"** which many feel sounds like a geography channel or a clothing store.\n\nKey points raised:\n*   The poll is criticized for being old (from Aug 2023) and for lumping \"Never heard of\" and \"Not sure\" together, which are two different things.\n*   Most agree that Claude's user base is still very niche, primarily consisting of programmers and writers, and hasn't reached the general public like ChatGPT.\n*   The \"we're still early\" investment talk led to a debate. While some are hyped for a potential IPO, others fear the \"enshitification\" that often follows. The most upvoted advice for investors was to **just buy Google stock (GOOGL)**, as they are a major investor in Anthropic.",

So I built Agent37.\n\n**The problem:** Selling Claude skills today means asking customers to download your skill, set up Claude Code on their laptops, configure MCP servers, and pray it works. No trial, no updates, often you're just handing over the source.\n\n**What I built:** Upload your Claude skill → get a shareable link → anyone can try it instantly (no Claude account needed) → they subscribe when it clicks → you keep 80%.\n\n**Idea:**\n\n* Skills stay private (no source code exposed)\n* Updates to skills roll out automatically\n\n**Demo:** You can try a few live skills here: [https://www.agent37.com/#demo](https://www.agent37.com/#demo)\n\n**Looking for:** Beta creators who have Claude skills or MCP servers they want to monetize. First 10 signups get personal onboarding.\n\nWould love feedback - what would make this useful for you?\n\n**Link:** [https://agent37.com](https://agent37.com)",

So I don't see the point.\n\nMaybe the framework that runs the sandboxed agent itself could be valuable ? but then again I don't see that as complicated enough, it's literally 4-5 files. We do run Claude Code (Agent SDK) with custom models like Gemini to save cost. So maybe there's a subset there that can be extracted and open sourced.

              "text": "Good question!\n\n1. At the moment I haven't considered letting the user just download a skill for a ONE time payment. Practically, none of the creators I'm working with have asked for this. Most creators want to have some kind of a recurring SAAS like model rather than a one time give away. Although, it would be a very simple change to allow this, if users asked for this.\n2. Yes, it's a monthly fee for the ability to use the skill. And it's accessed via the chat interface in [https://agent37.com](https://agent37.com) directly. So no API involved. The creator would get a unique chat url like [https://agent37.com/skill-creator](https://agent37.com/skill-creator) that they can share with their audience. And so the user would just use that url to interact with it.\n\nSo basically think if it like a CustomGPT but for Skills. They can only interact with the skill from the hosted link chatbot. But it has built in file uploads, artifact downloads (generated from AgentSDK), voice chat, etc. So for a layman user you're not losing much, you're basically interacting with it on a web browser directly like a hosted Claude Code instance on the web, instead of having to download and setup Claude Code locally.",

(IMO)\n\nI could be off base and not have the right POV but that is my first reaction. I will say that I think your idea has merit especially as we get more specialized skills, so I’m curious to see how it evolves. Congratulations on building a market place.",

I was installing some open source software with help from Claude, one configuration kept not quite doing what i thought it should do and without hesitation Claude jumped to the code side of the fence and just changed it to fit my wish. recompile and there it was, just the way i wanted it.\n\nThis made me realize that AI + open source is a different story entirely. The code being open is what makes it possible to change, but having AI help navigate and modify it is what makes it practical.\n\n\n\nThose little issues that were always technically fixable but not worth the cognitive overhead? Now they actually get fixed. The \"you can customize it yourself\" promise stopped being theoretical and became real.\n\n\n\nJust wanted to share - didn't see this coming, but the synergy is genuine.",

The key takeaway is that AI acts as a universal translator and assistant, making it practical for anyone (even experienced devs in an unfamiliar stack) to fix annoyances or customize tools without a massive headache.\n\nA big discussion popped up about what to do when the original project updates. The community's advice is:\n\n*   **Contribute back!** The most popular suggestion is to clean up your changes and submit a Pull Request (PR) to the original project.\n*   **If you keep it for yourself, create a patch.** You can use `git diff` to save your changes to a file and then `git apply` it to the new version after you update.\n\nThere was also a quick chat about licensing, with the general agreement being that for personal use, you're not obligated to share your changes back. Overall, the vibe is super optimistic about this synergy between AI and open-source, with some users already doing this with local models and tools like OpenCode.",

Open source always assumed you had the time, context, and mental energy to reverse-engineer someone else’s architecture. AI collapses that gap.\n\nOne thing that reinforces your point is Google’s new **Code Wiki**:  \n👉 [https://codewiki.google/](https://codewiki.google/)\n\nIt’s essentially a structured way to generate and maintain *living documentation* for real codebases — how they’re built, how components relate, design intent, and evolution over time. When you combine:\n\n* open source code,\n* AI that can reason about it,\n* and tools like Code Wiki that externalize architectural knowledge,\n\nyou remove the biggest historical tax of open source: cognitive overhead.\n\nThe result isn’t just “I can fork it if I want” — it’s:\n\n* *I can safely modify one function without breaking the system*\n* *I can understand why something was implemented a certain way*\n* *I can decide whether a change is worth making in minutes, not days*\n\nThat’s a qualitative shift. Open source stops being a philosophical freedom and becomes a **practical, day-to-day customization layer**.\n\nWe’re basically watching “read-only open source” turn into “conversationally editable software,” and that’s a big deal.",

This confirms OP's feeling of being \"differently busy.\" While actual keyboard time for coding is way down, time spent on **planning, prompt engineering, and especially code reviews is way up.**\n\nThe payoff is huge. Many report finishing a day's or even a week's worth of tasks by noon, freeing up time for higher-level strategic thinking, planning the next day's work, or just enjoying more free time. However, you still have to be the senior engineer in the room; the AI can be confidently wrong, use outdated libraries, or get lazy, so manual oversight is critical.\n\n**Pro-tips from the thread:**\n*   **Go hands-free:** Many are ditching typing for voice-to-text tools like Whispr Flow or Superwhisper to dictate prompts, citing typing as the new bottleneck.\n*   **Stop the sycophant:** To get Claude to challenge your ideas, give it a strong persona in the system prompt, like \"You are an elite Staff Software Engineer who pushes back on bad ideas.\"\n*   **Work in parallel:** Use `git worktrees` to manage multiple AI-driven tasks on the same repo at once.",

That's about my first 30-45 mins of the day.  I'll then spend an hour or two verifying/testing and then deploying the changes.   \n\nLately, those 3-4 tasks would have probably each taken me a day or more - so by noon each day I feel like I've accomplished a lot.  I'll usually go read and start thinking about my tasks that I want to do the next day, and then repeat.\n\nSo for me, I spend a lot less time at the keyboard, because 99% of the coding/implementation is now done for me, which also used to be the most time consuming task.\n\nI have time to think through problems in the afternoon and night and usually wake up with a good idea of how to specify it to Claude.  Sometimes at night I'll use the Claude App on my phone to talk through ideas on what I'm thinking.  Contrary to what a lot of people think, my Claude does push back against ideas, tells me when I'm not thinking about things the right way, etc.  It's become like my always on co-worker.

Just wanted to tell you how great you've been doing lately and I'm excited to continue our great progress this morning.  Today, we're going to explore implementing SSO and MFA for our users - I'm not real sure the best way to do this, so I'm going to lean heavily on your expertise for this project.  Based on some of our previous conversations, I think the best way to do this is to use a third party service, and I've decided between either Stytch or WorkOS, with leaning towards WorkOS because of the AuthKit built in web admin and dashboard.  As I think  about it, we don't necessarily need to use the same provider for SSO and MFA, if there's a reason to keep them separate - but I'll let you make the call.   We need to throw something together with the aim of rolling this out in the new year, so let's make sure we do things simply, to the point and with the best interest of our users in mind, as always.  Thanks Claude, I'm so excited to see what you're gonna come up with!\n\n\\-- So then I run this in plan mode, Claude went through my mono repo, made a plan to add api endpoints that integrated to WorkOS, asked a couple questions, put the code to update the database with the workos user and organization information.  Explained why it chose WorkOS vs Stytch for my use case and even went and added the login routing (go through native login or redirect to WorkOS auth page) (i ran at the top of my mono repo).   It was amazing, and so now I'm taking my time and building out Postman tests for everything it's done (so I can get a functional understanding, mostly with how the WorkOS APIs function).   The amount of code he wrote would have taken me days to write (even just to think out the api design) - and so now I had time to relax over Christmas and then just focus on testing and then roll out.\n\nThis is how i always prompt Claude - I treat it exactly like a human and humans hate being told how to specifically do stuff - give it autonomy and agency and do that old management trick where people work up to the level that you manage them - so if you treat it like a savant coder and talk to it in that way, it's gonna live up to those expectations.\n\nAlso, I have very minimal [Claude.md](http://Claude.md) files - I find the more specific things you give it the more it tends to lie or gaslight or whatever - but with my new approach I haven't seen a lie in a long time.",

Cheap labor to come do this won’t be a thing anymore. I get an entire department of world class developers for $200/mo. \n\nMy biggest concern is resource sustainability. Our power grids have been turned on their heads while dead enders hang onto fossil fuel. I’m getting emails from my internet provider about my increased usage. The rules will change and AI will become much more expensive. Still cheaper than manual labor, but probably out of the home market except for tools that give you better Tik Tok videos. \n\nThis is the sweet spot of new technology.

AI helps a lot with that but right now the solution is worse than the problem I would say 50% of the time. Knowledge cutoff is a big issue and if you follow blindly the solution you might end with very outdated libraries or deprecated apis in your code. Ultimately you are trading the time writing the code to the time writing the prompts.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where for me LLMs truly shine and are helping immensely:\n1) Code review: ask questions like \"as a new team member, would you be able to understand this code or is it relying on some implicit knowledge?\" or \"as a senior engineer, what is your opinion on this solution?\" provides tons of useful actionable insights onto the code that often far exceed the capability of traditional tooling like linters and static code analyzers.\n2) Large scale refactoring: LLMs are great at recognising patterns, like if I need to apply the same refactorings over and over on multiple files. It is often enough to provide one fully refactored file before and after, asking to write down the changes to confirm the task was understood, and then make it hammer down file by file, with immediate feedback\n3) annoying edits: things likes turn this list into a mapping or replace every usage of tuples here with with an array. one example is often enough to get the expected editing. This takes also way less time and skill than writing a regex or using a chain of coreutils, which makes it perfect for juniors.\n\nIn the end I would say you should still do the coding and if that is slowing you down work on your skills and not offload them to a program. If you depend on LLMs for your coding, realize you are one outage or tool ban away from becoming useless.\nMost of all I would never let the AI write the tests. Tests are the safety net to let anyone go ham on code, including LLMs. If you are starting from scratch try true TDD and encode behaviour in the tests, with the constraint that tests must pass and coverage must be always 100%. You will then be effectively using the model as a pairing partner, and get to ask questions and review the outputs together as the code is written, which is also great for learning",

I enable any mcps that may be needed (as few as possible) and point Claude code to the ticket and have it go into plan mode where I ask it to be specific about the implementation details. And then I let it go to work. I babysit for a few minutes to see if I run into any permission issues I have not anticipated. I go get a coffee. I review and commit each stage of the task. Depending on the ticket, I will make a pull request into GitHub. This kicks off my CI/CD that has an integrated deployment validation task and automatically has another Claude Code instance in the cloud do a code review. I point my local Claude Code at the PR and have it review the review and accept or resolve and issues. Sometimes I trigger a Copilot review, too, which is good at finding squirrelly issues that Claude misses, but, in general is not very smart. I really want to build my plugin for notifications with push over so I can respond to stoppages from my phone because they are mostly permissions or minor clarifications.",

      "text": "I just built an iOS app for new dads in 3 weeks using Claude Code. It's live in the App Store right now.\n\nThe first week home, my wife and I had the same fight every day: \"Did you feed her?\" \"I thought you did.\" \"When was the last diaper?\" \"I don't remember.\"\n\nSleep deprivation destroyed our memory. We needed to track things. So I downloaded every baby app.\n\nHere's what I found: Every app is designed for moms. Pink interfaces. \"Mommy tips.\" Breastfeeding trackers that assume dad isn't involved. Nothing spoke to my experience. Nothing addressed what I was actually feeling.\n\nWhat was I feeling? Constant anxiety. \"Is she eating enough?\" \"Why hasn't she pooped in 2 days?\" \"She slept 4 hours—is that too much? Too little?\" Every app gave me charts. None of them answered: \"Am I doing this right?\"\n\nThe pediatrician appointments were embarrassing. \"How many feeds per day?\" Uh... a lot? \"Wet diapers?\" Some? \"Sleep patterns?\" What's a pattern? I looked like an uninvolved dad. I wasn't. I just couldn't remember anything.\n\nSo I built Dad Co-Pilot. The goal was simple:\n\n* Track the basics (feeds, diapers, sleep)\n* Tell me if it's normal\n* Help me not lose my mind\n\nI used Claude Code to build it. 3 weeks. A complete iOS app. SwiftUI. Core Data. CloudKit sync. Widgets. Live Activities. I'm not exaggerating. 3 weeks from zero to App Store.\n\nHere's how it worked: I'd describe what I needed in plain English. \"Build a feed logging screen with a timer that works one-handed.\" Claude would write the Swift code. I'd test it while holding Emma. Give feedback. Iterate.\n\nThe architecture decisions came fast: Zero third-party dependencies. Just Apple frameworks. Local-first with CloudKit sync. No backend server. No monthly costs. ULID for event IDs. Time-sortable, works offline. Claude helped me think through all of it.\n\nThe hardest part wasn't code. It was figuring out what dads actually need. I kept adding features. Ounce tracking. Growth percentiles. Vaccine schedules. Then I'd try to use the app while holding Emma and realize: this is too complicated. I deleted 12 features.\n\nWhat survived is focused: One-tap logging. Feed. Diaper. Sleep. That's it. \"Is this normal?\" insights. Not charts. Context. \"5 feeds today—perfect! Most 2-month-olds have 4-6.\" Based on CDC and AAP guidelines. Reassurance, not data.\n\nAlso built features specifically for dads: Mental health breaks.\n\n* Breathing exercises (4-7-8 pattern)\n* 2-minute stretches for baby-carrying tension\n* Daily dad joke (because you need to laugh)\n\n73% of millennial dads report parenting anxiety. No app addresses this.\n\nPartner sharing without competition. Both parents see the same timeline. Both can log. No leaderboards. No \"mom did 60% of feeds.\" Just: \"Last feed was 2 hours ago. Your turn or mine?\" CloudKit sync means it updates in real-time across devices.\n\nNight mode that actually works. Pure black background. Red accents only. Why red? It's the wavelength that least disrupts night vision. Larger buttons. Fewer options. Whole-screen tap zones. Because at 3AM, you can barely think. You can barely see.\n\nThe full feature list:\n\n* One-tap feed/diaper/sleep logging\n* Pattern insights with CDC/AAP guidelines\n* Mental health breaks for dads\n* Partner sync via CloudKit\n* Automatic night mode\n* Screen widgets for easy logging\n* Live Activities for active timers\n\nBuilding with Claude Code changed how I work. I'd be pacing with Emma at 2AM, thinking about a feature. Next morning, I'd describe it to Claude. An hour later, it's built. The feedback loop is insane. Idea → code → testing in the same day.\n\n3 weeks of building. Here's the stack:\n\n* SwiftUI for all UI\n* Core Data for local storage\n* CloudKit for sync (free)\n* WidgetKit for home/lock screen\n* ActivityKit for Live Activities\n\nZero external dependencies. Just Apple frameworks.\n\nThe app is live in the App Store right now. Free to download. Premium features available. If you're a new dad, expecting, or know someone who is—this is for you.\n\n[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/baby-tracker-for-dads/id6755366965](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/baby-tracker-for-dads/id6755366965)",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 50 comments.**\n\n**The consensus in this thread is a hard disagree with OP's premise.** The community is pointing out that numerous popular, gender-neutral, and more feature-complete baby tracking apps already exist (like **Huckleberry, Baby Buddy, and Napper**), many of which are free or open-source. The claim that all current apps are \"pink and for moms\" is being heavily disputed.\n\nA second major theme is criticism of OP's priorities, with many questioning the decision to spend three weeks coding instead of providing hands-on support to his partner with a newborn. This has led to a side-debate about what \"involved parenting\" and the \"mental load\" really entail.\n\nFinally, many users suggest that a simple shared Google Sheet or group text is a more practical solution than a dedicated app with a subscription. While a few commenters appreciate the initiative, the overwhelming feeling is that this is an unnecessary and less-functional clone of better, existing products.",

It’s nice for me to see dads stepping up and putting their expertise into solving a problem. Even if solutions already exist, more options are welcome. \n\nAll the best to the family OP and good luck!",

A few users warn not to be so sure, noting this is the same state that actually passed a law banning chemtrails.\n\nThe general feeling is that even if it did pass, it would only hurt Tennessee. **AI companies would just geoblock the state**, causing it to fall behind economically until businesses lobby to get the law repealed. A highly-upvoted theory is that this is a move by the religious right to push people away from secular AI and back towards the church for emotional support.\n\nWhile most users think the bill itself is idiotic and unenforceable, there's a strong side-debate. **Many agree with the bill's *premise*, arguing that AI is not a real friend or therapist** and that forming deep emotional bonds with a pattern-prediction tool can be manipulative and dangerous, especially for people in a mental health crisis. They see the *intent* as valid, even if the execution is a dumpster fire.",

That is enough reason to worry.   \nI'm a pretty hardcore atheist, as in I'd prefer we slowly just completely rid ourselves of religion, but I don't think the core worry even if a decent chunk of this is because of religion is absurd. I don't want the bill to pass, especially as it'd affect me given where I live, but I don't think these are absurd things to worry and consider cutting off even if this bill is absurdly strong.",

To say someone is “knowingly” training an AI would imply the people training the AI understand how it works under the hood _and_ that they know enough to steer it in a given direction intentionally.\n\nI’d also be curious what jurisdiction they would have, or how they would prove it? All it seems it would take is the company claiming “we don’t train models in TN” and request it get dismissed. As written, you could provide the inference in TN and still not actually get struck by this bill.\n\nBut, again, I suspect the real reason is to try to get people to support a federal law preventing states from making their own laws regulating AI.",

The top-voted use is **\"meta education\"**—creating a personalized, on-demand library of AI-generated editorials and summaries on topics you're interested in. Others are using it for complex **financial planning**, managing **homelabs and server DevOps**, and even building the exact **\"personal life assistant\"** you were skeptical about, using markdown files to track life patterns and maintain accountability.\n\nThat said, a few users questioned why you wouldn't just use the regular Claude interface for simpler tasks, and one person raised a valid point: watch out for **fatigue from the generic \"AI writing style\"** if you're generating a ton of content for yourself.",

By setting up [Output Styles](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/output-styles), you can “modify” Claude Code’s system prompt to not generate code and instead do something completely different (think “Claude Anything”!  `keep-coding-instructions: false`). \n\nI have several “personalities” for Claude, with special agents, skills and commands per project too. This way, if I open one project, the default output style changes (per project output style setting for these). I have one for managing my media server (“Media Server Manager”), that can use skills to use APIs (less token bloat than using MCPs for the same actions!), agents for specific tasks I do with the server when they need their own context windows, and commands for tasks I do regularly. I have another for my writing, another for my Obsidian notes, and then of course some for code too! So many opportunities!! Honestly, using Claude Code this way feels like being able to use Claude on steroids. Since it has filesystem access, it can reason across many files at once without having to upload them and just create new markdowns with more knowledge it can pull from too.",

It served as an advisor on things like subscriptions, why my grocery budget is so high, and how much money I'm actually saving with sinking funds.  They could then work with the asset manager on how much I could be investing pre/post tax and how that factors into long term retirement. \n\nI had a development agent that was essentially a coder to write the API interface to YNAB and Python scripts to get data for the other advisors.

Their job was to read my assets, debt, income statements and interview me about my short term and long term goals were and discuss different feasible options. It would dispatch the sub agents to do some of this work and finally generate a multiphase action plan. I also used it to lay out a few retirement scenarios.

In that same directory is a python script that runs linting for all of my python services. Cc reads the context file and then knows how to use the script. With that context, Cc can update the skill as needed. For example, adding a command line flag that allows Cc to invoke linting for only a specific directory. \n\nI like to use skills for writing as well to verify voice, generate images, etc. Highly recommend checking out Anthropic's code base for some examples: [https://github.com/anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills)",

And because all its configuration lives in plain `.md` text files, you can use Claude Code to improve *itself*.\n\nThis means Claude Code effectively learns from experience. You have full control over this process, too. Since everything is human-readable, you can inspect and edit these files yourself, so there's no need to create Skynet.\n\nAll of Claude Code's powers were built for coding, but it's incredibly powerful for any knowledge work. I'm building an AI assistant to help run my business. In another folder, I use it to create posts and articles. Since each project lives in its own folder with its own tools, personality, and capabilities, I don't struggle with \"one size fits all\" tools. Everything is customized for the task at hand. And yet it's easy to share useful tools across projects.\n\nI still use the web interface on my phone, but less every day. Once you watch Claude Code churn for hours on your behalf, it's hard to go back to copy-paste in the browser.",

This is my own idiosyncratic approach, growing organically from my daily workflow—which is exactly what makes Claude Code so useful.\n\nStart with version control. I use GitHub to track every revision. This means I can let Claude loose on my files and revert if needed. Claude works well with git, and I had it create a `/git-sync` command to keep my repo updated.\n\nThe foundation is my daily diary with tasks. I keep a diary/ directory with Markdown files named like `2025-12-29.md`. I add timestamps as headers throughout the day, and at the top I maintain a task list:\n\n  - [ ] Task description\n  - [x] Completed task\n\nThis basic Markdown syntax works great in Obsidian (clickable checkboxes) and tells both me and Claude the status of everything.\n\nTo manage all these tasks, I created Claude Code commands. Incomplete items move to `tasks.md` where I can organize, schedule, or defer them. The review process itself helps me prioritize.\n\nHere are the commands in my .claude directory (all created by Claude Code):\n\n```\n├── **commands**\n│   ├── add-task.md\n│   ├── extract-tasks.md\n│   ├── gather-context.md\n│   ├── git-sync.md\n│   ├── hello.md\n│   ├── improve-tasks.md\n│   ├── new-client.md\n│   ├── process-tasks-manager.md\n│   ├── review-tasks.md\n│   └── rn.md\n```\n\nBeyond this, I have dedicated folders for my clients, with sub-directories for budgets, docs, emails, meetings, proposals, and of course client-specific tasks.\n\nThe `hello` command does everything I want to start the day, and the `rn` command renames files to follow my conventions.\n\nThe `new-client` command creates the client directory structure and adds placeholder files.",

It notices things you can't see about yourself.\n\n\n\nExample: I kept rescheduling user calls (building = safe, talking = scary). Claude called out the pattern after tracking it for 2 weeks. That kind of accountability is impossible with a whiteboard.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Why markdown files work:\\*\\*\n\n\\- [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) = who you are, stable identity\n\n\\- [NOW.md](http://NOW.md) = current state + Memory Log of insights\n\n\\- You talk to Claude, it maintains the files\n\n\\- All memory is transparent, you control everything\n\n\n\nCommands like /start-day, /check-day, /end-day create structure without feeling rigid.\n\n\n\nThe longer you use it, the better it gets. Week 1 it's just tracking. Month 3, Claude knows your patterns better than you do.\n\n\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/lout33/claude\\_life\\_assistant](https://github.com/lout33/claude_life_assistant)\n\n\n\nIt's legitimately changed how I work.

      "text": "Hey everyone ! I'm writing this message on Christmas Eve because I really need to let go.\n\nI'm a junior developer from a computer science school in France and I've always loved creating and discovering new things.\n\nAt the beginning I was using Claude Web and I was already thriving, creating apps from scratch extremely fast and still having scalable and maintainable products. I created Ailog, a small company and started selling consulting services.\n\nI was already able to generate a stable revenue as a student. As Claude was a useful tool that allowed me to be faster while maintaining great product quality, I decided to invest $200 a month in the max plan. Claude Web was great but not so efficient when I needed to create production-ready systems. Sometimes I struggled a bit but eventually I managed to deliver something functional and clean.\n\nAnd then, Claude Code dropped.\n\nAt first, it was great. I could be even faster, create working apps only with a few words and have it read my architecture and iterate from there. Never have I ever been so efficient at printing money with a tool before. At my own scale of course, not a ton of money but a really decent income for me.\n\nWe decided to collaborate with friends of mine and to develop an app with my consulting company. We would be using Claude Code to be more efficient but we still wanted something robust and scalable.\n\nWe started development about 4 months ago and from then I've been increasingly addicted to Claude Code. I can literally spend nights without sleep to create new functionalities on my app, to debug something, to come up with new ideas.\n\nI feel like the possibilities are endless and yet my health isn't. I've come to a point where I'm on the verge of buying a second max plan for myself because the weekly limit isn't enough and I'm constantly thinking about new cool stuff that I could add to my app.\n\nI came across this limit when I reached my weekly limit after 3 days. I then started to work with API credits because I just couldn't let go and wanted my daily dose of dopamine from some cool agent creating amazing stuff in the blink of an eye.\n\nAnd now it's Christmas, I'm trying to spend some time with my family but the only thing I have in mind is credits.\n\nI'm writing this post as some sort of therapeutic measure, hoping it will help me realize the stupidity of all this.\n\nNow I'm off and I wish you all a merry Christmas.\n\nFlorent",

I feel qualified to give this advice  because I’ve struggled with addiction since I was 15 before getting clean at 24 and staying sober for 14+ years.  \n\n“But guy… I didn’t mention anything about drugs”?!  it’s funny because I used to think I had a drug problem.. until I realized I have a “more” problem. Whether it’s painkillers or Claude code for those of us who seem to relentlessly want more…. We all struggle the same in the end…. What starts out as fun turns into something we wind up resenting… and then …\n\nWe chase the thing we hate, which pulls us further away from the people and things we love.  \n\nI read your comment and it reminded me so much of how I started to view things in my life that I knew were  becoming a problem.  I want to give you an insane amount of credit for writing this post because I didn’t have your bravery 24.  I thought sharing any of this showed weakness and that I just needed more willpower.  \n\nI now realize it’s the complete opposite.  The strongest thing a person can do is share stuff like this and willpower does work… But it’s a finite resource and when it runs out, you’re back to doing the thing you promised yourself you wouldn’t do. \n\nA lot of people will give you different definitions of addiction. Some  will say this is addiction, others will say you’re just having fun and it’s better than other vices.… but the only definition that matters is yours. And I think the way you measure that is by looking at the things in life that you mentioned like your friends or family and being honest with yourself about if those are increasing in meaningfulness or decreasing.  \n\nIf they’re decreasing and you can’t stop spending nights without sleep on Claude code…. The best thing you can do is find another source of accountability to change your environment, because if you’re not able to fix it now you’re not going to be any stronger the more  this progresses.  That might mean cutting your Wi-Fi off at certain times so that even if you wanted to you couldn’t go online maybe it’s having your friends hold your laptop at night whatever it is just remember asking for help means you’re smart, not desperate.  I wish I could take a Time Machine back to myself as a teenager and save these things.  Because the people who care about you would happily help and in fact, they’ll probably be lowkey jealous with your dedication on self improvement. \n\nIf none of this feels applicable, maybe someone else reading it will find value.  Either way, technology can be very addicting and you’re not alone on this. Happy holidays and good luck with the digital detox.!",

But reddit keeps suggesting me threads like this lol\n\n\nI'm in my mid 30's, and I've spend most of my life playing videogames. But things changed for worse when I started playing competitive and online games. For the last year's I've been starting to feel I'm addicted and can't let go. I've formated harddisks full of games and uninstalled whole steam libraries more times that I remember. I've said, ok this is enough, but after a while, I come back. \n\n\nYou hitted a nail: we want more. A game is never enough, I need to play again. I need to grind some more Lvls to reach THAT skill, but then I want a little bit more, just to realize I never stop. \n\n\nOther thing you said that hit me was: the only definition that matters is mine. Wow, seriously. I usually think that is absurd to say I'm depressive, I'm a procrastinator, I'm addicted, or whatever, when there are other people with worse addictions... But who cares? The point is that I want to be better, I don't want to feel like this anymore, and I want to leave all for this behind. \n\n\nThe last year has been really really awful. I've lost moments with friends, family, and too many job opportunities to the point that I'm basically broke. Heck I almost lost my girlfriend in the process. I need to rebuild my career and it's not easy.\n\n\nAnyway: Thanks for your write. I really appreciate you took your time to help OP, I for sure will take something out of it for myself. \n\n\nHappy holidays Reddit stranger, love to you and your closed ones. And again, thank you",

I built a massive pharmaceutical prescription delivery system and driver mobile app with Blazor Hybrid alone. What would have taken a team of 5 developers 3 years to complete, I did alone in 6 months with Claude's help. The quality of code and deliverables surpasses my 30 years of expertise—absolutely fantastic.\n\nI still debug from time to time, but it's not about coding less; as long as you understand what Claude did, you're fine. I gave him my entire mobile app, which was slow, and Claude literally brought it up to enterprise-level performance. It's an amazing tool if you know what you're doing and how to use it to your advantage.\n\nI always ask Claude, before performing any modification, to explain in detail what he's about to do to make sure it's what I want. I often use it to optimize my UI by asking for 4-5 different HTML UI previews to choose from. I'll choose one and ask him to refine it until I'm happy with the result. Don't give him tasks that are too large, as he can struggle from time to time. Always make sure you fully understand what he's doing.\n\nI've been using it with massive success. Having my own development shop, this helps me tremendously. I develop 10X faster than a team of developers. My client had previously hired 2 developers from Europe who did a terrible job on the app. After one year, they were half done and asking for another $25K. What took them a year, I did in 2 weeks.\n\nWe're developing a system that links a network of delivery companies. The system dispatches deliveries to the right pharmacies and includes franchises, clients, drivers, paychecks, and invoicing. It has Google zone configuration, driver zone configuration with timesheets, over 10 different calculation methods (per hour, per km, per delivery, etc.), live communication/notifications, and tons of amazing features. Claude has been absolutely invaluable.\n\n(Sorry for my English.)",

I also feel that I will probably eventually hit a plateau in my use of claude code, when the app Im building stabilizes, and is in cruise control mode. So until then I m enjoying the ride, the intensity that comes with this frenzy of activity. I love claude code, I think it's an amazing tool if you're somewhat experienced in programming, as you can really direct it in the same way you would a small team of developers working for you. Now it's more about being a chief architect / product manager than a developer, but Im ok with that because Im building a product, and I actually enjoy the software architecture bit and managing projects.\n\nAnyway, maybe for you is different, and you need to set boundaries and rules to make your relationship with claude more healthy and work again in your favour.\n\nGood luck!",

You and me are both having addictive personalities. I love Claude just as much, and there truly is a \"wtf do I do now\" when I burn thru my limit 4 hours before it resets.\n\n  \nOver time, I learned to juggle with this. I'm also from Europe, and I noticed Claude tends to be less claudish between 8am and 4pm. So I would launch a session at 5-6-7am just to make sure I get assigned the smarter Claude, work on plans over 1-2 hours, then let it rip and execute. Most important, between 8am and 4pm, I do whatever else I need to do for life (schedule permitting, works if you're self-employed):\n\n\\- cook  \n\\- clean  \n\\- work out  \n\\- nap  \n\\- learn things that don't involve coding  \n\\- nap (not a typo).\n\n  \nNo, I do not sleep 8 hours at night.   \nI sleep 3-4-5 hours, claude it up a few hours, then sleep another 1-2 hours before 5-6-7am.  \n  \nTry to keep room dark, oled screen helps, everything on dark mode. It feels magical with some techno low-intensity beats.\n\nMid-day naps are crucial to keep your long term health going. My HRV gets fucked if I skip them, and I find myself less focused as well. I often get a good 3-4 hour nap in the middle of the day, phone on DND.\n\n  \nLLMs will only get better and faster. We need to be at our peak as well. Don't neglect exercise, and don't neglect sleep, just be smarter about it. Do it in stages. Still get 8-9hrs over 24hrs, it's good to ruminate ideas.",

They inherit psychological patterns from the generators of the tokens they've been trained at - humans. (The bias for simplicity causes them to (partially) infer the patterns that generated the tokens and learn *those*, rather than memorizing the frequency tables for every token.)\n\nYou can try to train human behavioral biases out of them, but then they'll perform worse in general (the better a network is at something specific, the worse it is generally).",

The top comments demand a concrete workflow instead of a wall of text.

One provided a detailed example of using subagents to successfully refactor a legacy codebase. Others argue that for speedrunning development, it's the only way. In response to the demands for proof, **OP provided a step-by-step workflow** using custom slash commands from their linked GitHub repo.",

I pop something like this, and any questions i have so far and then get it to use as many subagents as possible to fan out and research. Then ultrathink about what it found in this first pass, and use this to form a more informed research plan, fan out again to research this and anything else it needs more info on, and keep doing this until it can explain the topic to me. Then write a detailed document with some instructions on structure. I’ve seen it use up to 9 subagents in parallel for this. Then i ask it to fact check and reference, which tends to weed out some inaccuracies. The end result is a detailed technical doc for me to personally use to learn about how systems fit together. Its incredibly powerful.\n\nFor long technical docs where i can break this into independent chapters i can do something similar — high level research to plan which chaoters should exist. Subagents independently research and write each chapter (in separate files), then fact check these, then fan back in and cross reference across chapters to iron out inconsistencies. Again super useful for documentation, proposals, any kind of technical writing.",

Give one agent really broad tools, a massive context window and ability to iterate and test things and it will get there eventually even if, instead of tools and MCP it just writes python scripts that connect to your database to solve something, then forgets it did that and makes another identical python script a month later.\n\nIt's not efficient, it's not ideal, anyone can think of a million theoretically better ways to do it but it works and since last year API costs are so so much cheaper (and kind of also more expensive).\n\nThe sub agents approach is great but managing workflows and context between them is so so so hard to get working reliably compared to just giving it everything.\n\nAnd the tokem cost of history in Claude code is way higher than what we would do in Drupal if you're just dealing with content.",

I then told Claude to use jq to analyze the errors and find the 10 files with the least amount of errors and sic a set of background subagents on doing that. When that was done, I told it to take the workflow we'd just established and make it into a slash command where I can tell it stuff like `/phpstan-clear level 8 for the routing subsystem` and to also have instructions in the slash command to tell it how to prioritize information on compact so that it can continue until the job is done. \n\nOnce I set auto approve for almost all of the commands it wants to use, it's pretty much autonomous.

I think I should have all of the core framework and the other modules in other repositories done and ready to go through upgrading PHP version from 7.4 to 8.3 in a week or so.",

Subagents are very situational, they depend on what kind of project you are working on, and how you use Claude Code in general. I truly do not think they're good for everyone.\n\nWhen I use Claude Code, it's always for very targeted changes, something I can complete within a couple of hours tops. I never ask Claude to build an entire app from scratch start to finish for example, so the usual subagents (one for docs, one for testing, one for whatever...) are never really needed. \n\nI think it's also the fact that I don't like delegating too much, because I am worried the AI will go in a direction slightly different from the one I intended (not because Opus 4.5 is not good enough or anything, just because my prompts aren't always perfect and with LLM being indeterministic, you just never know). I never use auto-edit mode and I never send subagents do menial tasks for me. I want to tell Claude *specifically* what to do and review the change (code diff) before validating it. It takes the time it takes but after this at least I'm sure it's all done the way I intended. \n\nI have the same opinion about plugins or skills. There are very few things I do often enough that would justify their use. MCP servers on the other hand, yeah, I find them useful. I use context7 quite often for example (a bit obvious, but yeah).",

People get hung up on customized subagents, and I think they're sorta a trap. You can't make the agent \"smarter\" by giving it a good system prompt. \n\nAnother thing I want to push back on is your statement about them going off the rails. If you are rigorous in your spec and planning steps, then it just simply doesn't go off the rails for narrowly defined tasks. I know this is a trust-me-bro moment, but most people (at least the ones I've talked to) haven't really done the degree of speccing out and planning that's necessary. People get lazy, ask for a feature, then bitch about dumb AI when it's not perfect (not saying that's what you're doing, just saying this is what happens a lot). \n\nAI is good enough now that the skill set is different. I review diffs at the very end, after my agents have hacked away at it for a while. I don't want to waste my time reading as it goes—I'd rather spend my time architecting and doing code reviews, not in the weeds while it actually implements. And if you can get good plans, then the only fixes that are needed during code review time are very, very minor. And if they aren't, then it means the plan was shit.",

I've been using a similar approach but with the Superpowers plugin's brainstorming workflow.\n\nThe key is generating a structured plan file (docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md) during the design phase. When context gets compacted or you start a fresh session, you just say \"Read docs/plans and continue\" — the agent picks up exactly where you left off with full architectural context.\n\nIt's not perfect, but the plan file acts as external memory that survives compaction/session boundaries. Combined with subagent architecture (heavy lifting happens in isolated contexts), it's been more reliable than manual summarization for me.\n\nI wrote up various community approaches to this \"context rot\" problem here if anyone's interested: [https://jsonobject.com/the-context-rot-guide-stopping-your-claude-code-from-drifting](https://jsonobject.com/the-context-rot-guide-stopping-your-claude-code-from-drifting)",

In your analysis process:\n    \n    1. Chronologically analyze each message and section of the conversation. For each section thoroughly identify:\n       - The user's explicit requests and intents\n       - Your approach to addressing the user's requests\n       - Key decisions, technical concepts and code patterns\n       - Specific details like:\n         - file names\n         - full code snippets\n         - function signatures\n         - file edits\n      - Errors that you ran into and how you fixed them\n      - Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.\n    2. Double-check for technical accuracy and completeness, addressing each required element thoroughly.\n    \n    Your summary should include the following sections:\n    \n    1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture all of the user's explicit requests and intents in detail\n    2. Key Technical Concepts: List all important technical concepts, technologies, and frameworks discussed.\n    3. Files and Code Sections: Enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created. Pay special attention to the most recent messages and include full code snippets where applicable and include a summary of why this file read or edit is important.\n    4. Errors and fixes: List all errors that you ran into, and how you fixed them. Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.\n    5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.\n    6. All user messages: List ALL user messages that are not tool results. These are critical for understanding the users' feedback and changing intent.\n    6. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks that you have explicitly been asked to work on.\n    7. Current Work: Describe in detail precisely what was being worked on immediately before this summary request, paying special attention to the most recent messages from both user and assistant. Include file names and code snippets where applicable.\n    8. Optional Next Step: List the next step that you will take that is related to the most recent work you were doing. IMPORTANT: ensure that this step is DIRECTLY in line with the user's most recent explicit requests, and the task you were working on immediately before this summary request. If your last task was concluded, then only list next steps if they are explicitly in line with the users request. Do not start on tangential requests or really old requests that were already completed without confirming with the user first.\n                           If there is a next step, include direct quotes from the most recent conversation showing exactly what task you were working on and where you left off.

There’s also a [macOS arm64 binary](https://github.com/cliangdev/specflux/releases) you can download and play with if you’re curious.\n\n[https://github.com/cliangdev/specflux](https://github.com/cliangdev/specflux)\n\n[https://github.com/cliangdev/specflux-backend](https://github.com/cliangdev/specflux-backend)\n\n====================\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/f5n5e1mw169g1.gif\n\nI spent a few months using Claude Code at work and kept getting wildly inconsistent results.\n\nAt first I thought the AI was just unreliable. Turns out… I was the problem.\n\nWhat finally helped was adding real structure:\n\n* Proper specs (PRD → design → task breakdown → implementation)\n* Reusable commands/skills Claude could reference\n* Following the same workflow every time instead of winging it\n\nOnce I did that, results became way more predictable.\n\nThe new problem... keeping track of all this across projects and managing similar prompts.\n\nPRDs in Notion, designs in docs, tasks everywhere, and Claude constantly missing context.\n\nSo I built a small desktop app for myself that keeps PRDs, designs, and tasks in one place and feeds the right context to Claude so it doesn’t skip steps. My role shifted more into reviewing specs and code instead of fighting the tool.\n\nI’ve been dogfooding it for a few weeks and it’s helped enough that I’m thinking about open-sourcing it.\n\nCurious if anyone else went through this learning curve.\n\nHow are you structuring your workflow to get consistent results from AI tools?",

A CLAUDE\\_RESUME.md has its own independent details you can be sure that context can continue in the next session.\n\nThis is not a project management tool, it is a session persistence tool.

Along with context engineering at a project level, I have been working with a PSE Workflow for a number of months now. It stands for Plan > Spec > Execute.\n\nEvery project has a /docs/llm/ folder. In the /docs/llm/active/ folder is the current [plan.md](http://plan.md) file- you can brain dump and copy relevent context into that file, and use Claude to iterate on the plan. And then you can use the \\`/create-spec\\` command to turn that into a spec with actionable tasks. Each task has a checkbox - and at the bottom of the file is a a Progress Notes section which is updated as well as the LLM progresses through the spec. Both the task and the Progress section are updated as a task is started 🔄 and then completed ✅.\n\nYou can also complement the plan and spec files with research.md. There are a number of /commands wrapped around this tooling. Claude has started centralising plan files in the user level \\~/.claude directory, but I always get it to save the plan into the projects /docs/llm directory. The tooling can also read and update Plans and related files from Notion, and from GitLab/GitHub Issues and GitLab Sub-tasks.\n\nAnd when the work is finished as part of creating the MR/PR, the PSE files are archived into /docs/llm/completed/ sub-folder with a [metadata.md](http://metadata.md) file that summarises the work done, shows references like issue numbers, PRs, key words, a quick summary description of the work done etc etc.\n\nIf you want to have multiple Claudes working away from different plans, then you use Git Worktrees and repeat the process above.\n\nIt is overkill for quick tasks or bug fixes - that is where the context engineering at the project level is already in place and is available for all Claude prompts. But for larger chunks of work that require considered direction and guidance before you let Claude loose, it works well. And it provides consistent locations for Plans to reside and a way to archive all that useful history alongside the work done.\n\nBut ... I never considered wrapping this in UI tooling. Your desktop app looks extremely interesting, alongside some of the other ideas you have implemented there.\n\nVery interested to have a play if you are willing to share :)",

He has a PC that belongs to a museum, doesnt understand why would he want to upgrade it.\n\nI am sure (NOT CONVENIENT) that if you worry about AI because you know what its actually it, you will do fine.

Over time, it becomes normalized.\n\nI remember when searching the internet was considered \"cheating\" in schools and universities. The same thing happened with calculators on exams because \"you wouldn't learn real math.\" Stack Overflow and technical forums were seen as copying code, not learning. Excel threatened the jobs of accountants and analysts. Wikipedia wasn't a valid source; now it's the standard starting point. Email wasn't professional compared to physical mail. IDEs with autocomplete were for programmers who \"needed help\"; the real ones used plain text editors.\n\nThe pattern is always the same: resistance, then gradual adoption, then it becomes the new standard, and nobody remembers how things were done before.\n\nThe difference now is the speed of change. What used to take decades now takes years. Those who adapt quickly gain a massive competitive advantage. Those who resist are left behind, like the lawyer who prints out emails.\n\nYour work isn't more or less valid because of the tools you use. It's valid because of the problems you solve.",

In Latin America and parts of Europe it was more pronounced because internet adoption in education was slower.\n\nIf you studied after 2015 or in a more techfriendly env, makes sense you didn't experience it.

This is a big one for now, most companies are trying to do it in house and most will fail for this reason. You need specialized skills by someone who knows what leads to things like a LLM suddenly losing \"common sense\" in a situation.\n\n- smooth brained leadership. Most leaders do not have the mental aquity or background to understand and execute a well designed AI strategy\n\n- legacy. Like inertia, I was dealing with a client last year that has billion dollar revenues and they still have a legacy windows 2003 solution going for a critical part of the business. Windows 2003!!!\n\n- internal resistance. It may stress people out, especially in the short term if they are concerned about losing thier job. Having strong internal resistance against the concept in the first place will be a stalling point\n\nMy last thing on this is any company now that is built using AI first using the architecture to support it is going to be in a much better position then established companies trying to adapt",

That time is spent editing, dealing with distractions, and fighting with my smartphone keyboard that will not write a wide variety of words that I frequently use. \n\nIf you had people giving you very thoughtful correspondence, you were replying with thoughtful correspondence, and the secretary was also thoughtfully interpreting both the curation of what gets printed and interpreting the written response (perhaps with additional context), all of the jobs and interactions might be fulfilling, even the secretary job. \n\nIn the late 90’s when I used Lotus Notes and did consulting work, I think I had about 2-3 emails a month that really needed attention. Most of my work was in Excel or over the phone, and I was incredibly productive. We printed every email and put it into the client file. So if you wanted to know what the partners or analysts (my level) were saying, you could just review the correspondence in the file. That went back 2-5 years.\n\nFor some clients the file was thick with silly forwards, which was annoying to the young people like me, but at least you could access ALL the information in the relationship in one file. But you damn well better put the file back when you were done, because there was only one copy. Lol. \n\nI got so much real work done that contributed to real decisions and real lasting outcomes.

Beyond that, users are dropping links to a huge variety of projects:\n\n*   A fast-growing Reddit game called **Turret Defense**.\n*   Mobile apps for everything from grocery lists (**QwkList**) to event ticketing (**SocialLoop**).\n*   SaaS products and developer tools like **ChunkHound**, **NeoSignal.io**, and **Badass Network**.\n*   Even a full B2B quotation system that's already generating significant revenue.\n\nThe general vibe is that Claude Code is a game-changing 'pair programmer' that enables everyone from solo founders with no coding background to senior engineers to build and ship complex applications much faster. So yeah, OP, you're about to get a *lot* of content for your newsletter.",

Claude consistently runs for minutes, hours, and days at a time (using Stop hooks). Software engineering is changing, and we are entering a new period in coding history. And we're still just getting started..\"*\n\nThis is similar to my own experience with Opus 4.5 + Claude Code. I landed 324 commits to [NeoSignal.io](http://NeoSignal.io) over last 3 weeks!",

About a year ago I was made redundant at my job and now am a stay at home dad. I first started about 8 months ago building an app by just promoting gpt and copy/pasting code snippets then running scripts through other ai chats to check code quality, structure and optimisation suggestions. I managed to get as far as a homepage screen and a camera button that took a photo of your meal and send it and a prompt to ai api and returned a structured json of the meal and its ingredients and macros/ calories then displayed them on the home page. I then discovered claude... I have now spent from 8pm till like 3 - 4 am almost every single night for the past 6 months building a health and fitness app called HUD+ that is ready to release in 4 days! I may come back to this post and let people know how release went after a while",

Features include a Markdown editor, interactive radial maps showing connections between story elements, a special linking syntax ([@id]) to connect scenes with characters/places, inline annotations (TODO, NOTE, FIX), and professional PDF export.\nTech stack: ClojureScript frontend, Tauri for the desktop wrapper (runs on Mac, Windows, Linux), shadow-cljs for builds.\nThe Claude Code experience: I built this entirely with Claude Code. The whole architecture, the UI components, the Tauri integration, the custom .trmd file format — all of it emerged from our collaboration. Claude even shows up as a contributor on the repo!\nNote: The README is still in Italian (my native language), but the app itself supports both English and Italian, and the user manual is available in both languages.\nI’m a novelist working on my second book, so I built this to solve my own problem: keeping a complex story organized without losing the creative flow.\nHappy to answer any questions about the process.",

The core idea is: detect + explain + enforce at runtime without shipping data off-box.\n\nWhat’s unique vs typical “prompt filters” is the model approach: a **5-head multi-task classifier** that scores multiple risk signals *in parallel* (think **prompt-injection/jailbreak attempts, sensitive-data leakage, unsafe/tool-misuse behavior, policy/tone violations, and general anomaly/abuse** the exact heads are configurable). That gives you a richer, composable decision than a single “safe/unsafe” label.\n\nIt’s also **explainable** (human-readable reasons + what triggered the decision), so security/ops teams can debug *why* something got blocked/redacted instead of treating it like a black box.\n\nClaude Code was genuinely useful for accelerating the repo end-to-end: scaffolding the runtime pipeline, tightening the architecture, adding tests/eval harnesses, and iterating quickly on the multi-head classification + docs.

The consensus here is a big ol' **'Yep, OP is right, don't blindly trust the bot with anything that goes 'delete'.** This is a classic \"trust but verify\" situation.\n\nMost of the thread agrees that Claude can be a bit trigger-happy with destructive commands and isn't careful enough. However, a good chunk of users report the exact opposite, saying their Claude is *overly* cautious and always wants to back things up. So, YMMV.\n\nThe prevailing sentiment is that this is less a Claude failure and more a rite of passage for \"vibecoders\" learning the hard way. Many are calling this a lesson in Docker hygiene and basic developer best practices.\n\nHere are the key takeaways and solutions from the community:\n*   **Never let Claude run breaking changes without manual backups.** When it comes to delete commands, just do it yourself.\n*   If you're unsure, **ask Claude to explain in detail *why* a command is safe.** This either catches a hallucination or you learn something new.\n*   **Use version control like Git.** This started a whole side-quest about whether you should store a live database in Git (spoiler: probably not), but the core principle of versioning your code and configs is non-negotiable.\n*   OP later clarified the specific \"gotcha\" was with the `Kamal` deployment tool, which deletes volumes when accessories are removed, a nuance Claude missed.",

It's still preferable to somebody like me who couldn't literally tell you what power shell or python actually did or if I have been installed on my computer at all and now I'm learning something new about that building or image generation or AI in general every day and it's never been easier to learn advanced skills and trades like coding and image editing but have also created a state where humans have never needed to learn it less. Anthropic literally uses clout to write some parts of their code so it's worth remembering vibecoding isn't equal to genuine software development but it is making incredible strides and coming closer all the time",

I mean I know the chances are far and few between that it would go rough and maybe turn the stove a temp that might cause it blowup the house. I do have a question are you running your agent locally isolated to your home network or is fully connected to the internet.

Unfortunately many \"AI tools\" in existence have only the option to use keys (bring your own keys and pay as you go plans) [1].\n\nFor example, most Obsidian plugins allow AI access with keys to multiple providers or via OpenAI compatible API. The alternatives have been to run Claude Code directly in the Obsidian vault folder or using the Obsidian MCP server.\n\nOpencode solves the multi-service problem with AI SDK and Models.dev. I was a few weeks ago thinking of hacking some Obsidian plugin to use this setup but could not decide in which to put my effort in as none were really that \"perfect\" alone.\n\nI was also thinking a proxy could be a solution - but did not have time to research more into this or make something actionable. Well, good that I didn't start coding blindly - CLIProxyAPI can do it all now and somehow I missed it.. too much to follow..\n\n[1] Often bring-your-own-keys options are bundled with an offer of \"10$/mo\" all you need plan for that particular tool. Every tool repackaging access to the same Anthropic/OpenAI/Google models with maybe a tiny layer of custom system prompt is not viable approach for a consumer and therefore not really a viable business model - the differentiation has to be with the features and updates, not with AI access.",

Claude Code in telegram\n\nOn  the  screenshot  we  are  going  through  my  morning  routine. Claude turns on Spotify, asks me what  is the plan for today, did I meditate, that kind of thing. Also cool stuff you can do is a cron job to analyze your Obsidian vault  project and get the daily brief for the next day.\n\nWhat else it does: queries my calendar and reminders and searches my vault. Can do brainstorming sessions where it actually knows what projects I'm working on.\n\nMain use case for me: brainstorming on the go. Have a back and forth with the agent, then when you are done I can  say  \"document this into my vault.\" Later when I'm at my computer, the context is already there.\n\nYou can technically do coding through it too, but observability isn't great. I don't  recommend Works best for querying notes, asking questions  about  projects,  events,  etc\n\nStack: Mac Mini, Claude Code with custom skills  (calendar  skill,  obsidian  skill), Telegram bot, Obsidian vault.\n\nAnyone else using Claude Code as a personal assistant?\n\n  \nUPDATE: Hey, here's the video I recorded yesterday.

          "text": "**tl;dr**: Voice memo to Telegram → Whisper transcription → Claude searches my notes via RAG → answer back to Telegram. Also runs daily cron to parse my backup logs and tell me what broke overnight. Think NotebookLM but 80% self-hosted.\n\n---\n\nSo I've got years of notes in Obsidian - (2 vaults, personal/work) with years of stuff. And I got tired of that thing where you KNOW you wrote something down but spend 20 minutes grepping through search results trying to find it.\n\nEnter RAG: So my assistant is essentially home-grown NotebookLM (which for me acts as RAG-Lite) with the embeddings created locally using `nomic-embed-text-v1.5` locally, and it monitors for changes to my sources (which I can add/remove at will) every 60 sec. It handles PDF, Office files + text.\n\nThe difference with my setup is it's about 70% in-house, 20% Claude, 10% OpenAI. All documents stay local (but embeddings go out). Embeddings using ```nomic-embed-text-v1.5``` live in SQLite on my machine. Only the query + relevant context goes to cloud for Claude in headless mode to synthesize an answer.\n\nSo there's no privacy, but I am not limited to the free tier of NotebookLM's 50 queries/day thing. Though i do use NotebookLM for some of their unique outputs, occasionally.\n\n**The Telegram + Voice Thing**\n\nSo I can type to the RAG-Lite using a web-interface or I can send voice commands and queries to it from Telegram.\n\nThe Flow:\n\n1. Send a voice memo using Telegram\n2. My script polls for the file on my personal bot. Grabs it, sends it to OpenAI Whisper for speech-to-text\n3. The transcribed text routes to Claude Code (`-p` flag for headless/pipe mode).\n4. Claude searches my indexed vaults, finds relevant chunks among the embeddings of my sources & synthesizes the answer.\n5. I can ask follow up questions (context is maintained in SQLite and when I get to 80% of 200k which is the context limit, it auto asks Claude to summarize it.) That will \"compact\" it and start a new conversation automatically.\n5. Oh yea, the response comes back to Telegram in my bot-chat.\n\nSo I can ramble on about, \"hey what was that backup rotation policy we set up last year on XYZ\" and get an actual answer citing where I wrote it. I find myself asking it a lot for IP addresses I've journaled from my work knowledge base. Oh and every prompt to it adds the system date/time so it knows last year from last week in my queries because my notes are always dated.\n\n*Log Review*\n\nI run a bunch of maintenance scripts and backup jobs via cron. Logs = wall-O-text and I don't use Grafana, not at home anyway. I've got a cron that runs every morning, scrapes through all my maintenance logs, and has Claude parse out anything CRITICAL or HIGH severity which will include: Likely root cause based on the log review and a recommended fix. It's not always right, but it gets me 60% there, which is enough and worth it to me.\n\nAlmost forgot - I can say in telegram \"create a note about [topic]\" and it generates a properly formatted note in my Obsidian vault (I use MOC note formatting).\n\n**The Stack**: Nothing too exotic ...\n- Python backend with SQLite + sqlite-vec for local embeddings\n- Hybrid search: semantic similarity + BM25 keyword matching with RRF fusion\n- Claude API via CLI (`claude -p` for piped/headless queries)\n- Telegram bot (systemd service) for voice interface via recorded msgs\n- OpenAI Whisper for STT\n- Cron + systemd for scheduled log reviews\n\nThe voice interface is surprisingly natural and the log review has made me way more proactive about maintenance instead of waiting for things to break.\n\nThe \"NotebookLM but self-hosted\" thing was the goal. I'd say I'm 80% there - the 20% that's cloud is the synthesis step I don't have the compute needed at home to match what Opus/GPT can do.\n\n---\n\n*edit: oh yeah ... I know obsidian-copilot exists. I wanted something that works from my phone via voice without opening the app. Also mine handles pdf's, .xlsx with multiple tabs, and .docx as well.\n\nI find Obsidian on mobile too annoying to use (lots of taps.........)",

I checked the Claude terms of svc and so long as it's not commercial and the usage is \"reasonable\" whatever that means, but it's like 20-30 queries a day, 50 max which I've never hit yet.... it's fine. There seems to be no glaring block to use headless mode programmatically so long as you are reasonable about it as far as I can tell.
