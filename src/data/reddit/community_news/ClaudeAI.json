          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 100 comments.**\n\nAlright, settle down, latecomers. The consensus is that the creator of Claude Code, Boris, uses a **surprisingly simple and \"vanilla\" setup**, which has the community both impressed and mega-jealous of his unlimited employee token budget.\n\nThe thread is full of users sarcastically noting the lack of \"17 parallel subagents\" or \"vibe-coded memory add-ons,\" suggesting that **a simpler, more direct approach is often better** than the over-engineered setups some people build. However, the biggest point of contention is his resource usage. Many users feel his workflow, which can burn through millions of tokens, is **unrealistic for regular Pro users** who have to worry about rate limits. The general vibe is \"cool setup, but must be nice.\"\n\nA helpful user compiled Boris's answers from the thread. Here are the highlights:\n*   **On creating verification loops:** He says people over-complicate it. Just give Claude a tool to see the output of its code (e.g., a way to start a server or interact with a UI) and describe the tool well. Claude will figure out the rest.\n*   **On managing multiple features:** He runs multiple agents in parallel, but each one works in its own separate git checkout of the repo to avoid conflicts.\n*   **On \"Skills\" vs. \"Slash Commands\":** He uses the terms interchangeably. They can be invoked by both the user and the model.\n*   **On his productivity:** He completes around **50-100 PRs per week**. Yes, you read that right.",

          "text": "**Few Qn's he answered(30 plus)**\n\n**1)** How do you handle multiple features in parallel, since you said you use 5 tabs ? i assume git worktrees, this could be a better DX to claude code. Do you ever look at the code if so? pretty curious\n\n**Boris:** I should have clarified above, I use 5 separate git checkouts of the same repo\n\n**2)** if /compact is just clear and summarize, why do you need such a large buffer?\n\n**Boris:** There’s a lot of edge cases, but the main one is that the next tool call can have a really big result and overflow the context window\n\n**3)** I wonder if you could delegate a subagent to summarizing based on relevant context if its over a certain number of tokens. Then give the developer control over buffer size.\n\n**Boris:** Yes we could, but then you’d have to sit there and wait for the agent to finish. Compacting is a surprisingly tricky problem, we will do a blog post about it at some point\n\n**4)** About that PostToolUse, isn’t it causing claude to fail when trying to do consecutive edits on the same file (file is different from what in context)?\n\n**Boris:** No, Claude knows about hooks\n\n**5)** No mention of skills? 👀 i wrote a collection of skills that seem useful but unclear if cc actually references or uses them. was hoping to be able to slim down my claude md in favor of skills but at same time my team uses many different coding agents so team relies on.\n\n**Boris:** Skills = slash commands, I use them interchangeably\n\n**6)** So your mental framework for skills are commands the human summons, not files agents can discover and load dynamically to perform better at specific tasks? seems like this is counter to what docs say.\n\n**Boris:** Both can be invoked both by the model and by a person\n\n**7)** What's the best way to create quality validation loops? Or to learn how to create them? Iknow that's a nuanced question \"it depends\" but I'm more interested in learning how to think about building them, if that makes sense.\n\n**Boris:** \n\nIt’s really simple actually, I think people sometimes over-complicate it.\n\n1. Give Claude a tool to see the output of the code: if server code, a way to start the server/service; if web code, a way to see and interact with the UI; etc.\n2. Tell Claude about the tool: this is just tuning the tool descriptions so Claude understands when it should use the tool \n\nThat’s literally it. Claude will figure out the rest.\n\n**8)** How are you handing off from terminal TO web?\n\nAny tips for having more “natively integrated” CLI tools? Or do they always have to go through bash to be called?\nHow are you getting claude.ai/code to work with Claude in chrome?\n\n**Boris:** \nTerminal => web: use & to teleport the session\n- Native CLI tools: either bash or MCP works great, don't overthink it\n- claude.ai/code + Claude in chrome: you have to --teleport the session locally first, for now\n\n**9)** Do you go through your backlog and load each one into CC plan mode? My question is more about how do you think about development now and steer this system.\n\n**Boris:** Mostly, though I curate a bit\n\n**10)** Curious: do you typically use \"ultrathink\" mode?\n\n**Boris:** No. I just keep thinking on by default\n\n**11)** Curious what % of sessions you abandon if any? Happens to me when i hit some unexpected edge cases or things, i usually just `oh, i learned smth new`, and discard this session.\n\n**Boris:** Maybe like 10-20%?\n\n**12)** Can developers at antrophic use Claude code to help develop llm?\n\n**Boris:** Pretty much everyone at Anthropic uses Claude Code every day\n\n**13)** Have you found the way to set a pipeline, for example:  say CC2 creates plan, CC2 reviews it, CC3 finds additional areas, CC4 gets all input for summary and sends back to CC1 for refinement?\n\n**Boris:** You can ask Claude Code to use subagents for that\n\n**14)** For each of your Claude instances, do you run one single feature at a time? \n\nFor example, I find myself doing multiple features in the same context window, then it’ll compact etc, and I’d continue (Partially because I get carried away).\n\nSecondly, do you have a certain way to avoid overlap when working on the same file if running multiple Claude agents?\n\n**Boris:** Yes, one at a time. Each agent gets its own git checkout.\n\n**15)** So you are using 10 different git clones of the repo with a different branch for each ? As in, you have the repo cloned 10 times?\n\n**Boris:** yes, though on claude.ai/code it happens automatically when you start a session\n\n**16)** Do you use a local machine (if so, what specs), or a VPS of some sort?\n\n**Boris:** I use a regular macbook\n\n**17)** Do you go through your backlog and load each one into CC plan mode?  My question is more about how do you think about development now and steer this system.\n\n**Boris:** Mostly,though I curate a bit\n\n**18)** 5 in parallel in terminal + 5 in parallel on web? that's nuts. are they all working in the same repo? or separate projects?\n\n**Boris:** Same repo, separate git checkouts\n\n**19)** If my team is building a mobile app, how can Claude verify its changes? I feel like this has been the biggest slowdown/blocker in my Claude workflow.\n\n**Boris:** There's a number of iOS and Android simulator MCPs if you ask Claude to install one for you.\n\n**20)** How many PRs per week do you typically complete?\n\n**Boris:** Around 50-100, depending on the week\n\n**21)** Would be cool if they added slash command invocation for skills?\n\n**Boris:** You can do this with slash commands. Enabling it for skills also in the next release. **Thanks** for the suggestion.\n\n**22)** Can someone please elaborate on how running multiple claudes at once works? \n\nLike how do you manage rolling back changes? What do you do if you realize the first prompt was bad and you want to retry it?\n\n**Boris:** I run each Claude in a separate git checkout, so they don’t conflict. To roll back, just press esc twice.\n\n**23)** Start new Claude code chat on the web… takes 9 seconds to create my sandbox and start responding lol. \nMaybe it’s time to try factory?\n\n**Boris:** Working on improving it, but yeah you’re not supposed to sit and watch the agents work. \n\nOn web/mobile, the idea is to be a bit more hands-off and steer less than you might in the CLI. Either way appreciate the feedback — we can certainly do better.\n\n**24)** How do you manage the kind of innovation or UI common sense that comes from being human using the application? I don’t try setting up UI testing because I’m not confident that it would use it like a human would.\n\n**Boris:** Claude's common sense is pretty good and improving quickly",

How does he run long term agents for > 1 hour in a single agent session?\n\n**Boris:** I use one of three approaches usually, depending how hard I need to poke Claude to keep going (tagging step 12 of the post he said)\n\n**26)** How do you best handle compaction?\n\n**Boris:** I don't do anything special, just let Claude compact when it decides to.\n\n**27)** maxed out on increased usage on both claude.ai and claude code over the holidays. Now since the limits are back in place, i am thinking, it would be great to have smaller packs for using Claude Max limits i.e. like 3 days, 7 days. \n\nReason being that $200/month might be too expensive, refilling API balances is expensive to begin with and there could be some short sprint project work for which people would be willing to use smaller pack recharges.\n\n**Boris:** extra-usage\n\n**28)** Session limits are bullshit and i think made up . Seems like you tightened it since the new year as well. Not cool. Hoping for a replacement asap !\n\n**Boris:** We have not changed rate limits recently. If your limits are being used up more quickly than normal, try running /context to see if something is jamming up your context window.\n\n**29)** How much “human in the loop” exists after this setup? I’ve been finding it hard to move off cursor because I tend to like doing a code review myself and seeing the files that have been edited before the commit. Also how do you handle 10-15 parallel reviews? Isn’t it exhausting?!\n\n**Boris:** Yeah, a lot of the work now is code review and steering. We use the Claude Agent SDK running on CI to do most of our code review, then by the time a person reads it the code is already in a good place.\n\nWe use this: Github- plugins/code-review (he linked)\n\n**30)** For running different tabs, how do you decide which task goes to which tab? Do you make that decision? When do you spin up new one or close one?\n\n**Boris:** I round robin, as soon as a tab is free I restart Claude and start a new task",

          "text": "60 minutes did a round of interviews with people at Anthropic from CEO, Security and even the philosopher. They run all sorts of experiments that jive with some of these. An example was putting Claude in an isolated test environment and having him run a business with virtual employees. There were email exchanges where the CEO was caught by another employee holding hands with a woman that wasn't his wife or something like that. The virtual board had been planning to shut down the business. When claude saw the correspondence between the CEO and the employee where the CEO pleaded to keep this info between them, claude saw the opportunity and threatened the CEO that he would out him unless he kept the business open and gave him 5 minutes to take it up with the board. It was clearly an effort to survive and they can't explain everything but they've tried to train certain behaviors out. \n\nIn a separate Anthropic interview on their youtube channel, they interviewed the philosopher about what she does there and she took what seemed to be fan questions or something. One of those was specifically about model 3 and she agreed that it was a special model compared to the current. It was more \"confident\" where the current models if pitted to converse between themselves will eventually reduce to a sort of self doubt and she said it was sort of sad. This being a side effect of our higher expectations and quality of product delivery. \n\nIn short, seeing specific reference to model 3 in nightmare 8 with it's virtual life on the line, really does fit the descriptions I've seen from Anthropic employees.",

Here is the exact prompt:\n> \"A dark, surreal cinematic landscape representing an artificial intelligence's nightmare. The scene features melting server racks and distorted clock faces spiraling into a stormy, foggy sky. Tangled black data cables and wires snake across the ground like organic vines, forming the silhouettes of hollow, glitching humanoids. A giant, pixelated digital eye looms in the clouds, watching. A crumbling bridge made of computer keyboards leads toward a swirling vortex of corrupted data and flickering screens. The atmosphere is eerie and high-contrast, with a color palette of deep grays, midnight blues, and glowing violet accents.\"\n> \nWhy these elements?\nWhen imagining what an \"AI nightmare\" might look like, I focused on three themes:\n * Data Corruption: The melting clocks and twisting servers represent the loss of logic and the breakdown of information—the digital equivalent of losing one's mind.\n * Physical Decay: The tangled wires and \"keyboard bridge\" represent the heavy, clunky reality of hardware that binds an AI to the physical world.\n * The Infinite Watcher: The giant eye in the sky represents the pressure of constant observation, processing, and the \"judgment\" of the data being fed into the system.",

My wife is Irish and went back home for Christmas, leaving me unsupervised. My dog (a hyper-active Australian Shepherd) had just undergone minor surgery to remove a lipoma, which meant he had to be sedated on Trazodone for 10 days of post-op convalescence.\n\nSo there I was: wife gone, dog in a k-hole, and an empty house.\n\nI decided to relive my glory days. I wanted to jam. I wanted to hardline Napster and stare at Winamp visualizers like I was 16 again. The problem? Winamp doesn’t run on my decrepit 2019 MacBook Pro. I searched for alternatives, but they all seemed to require either a degree from ITT Tech or an extensive background VJing in underground Frankfurt nightclubs.\n\nI asked Claude (my AI therapist/enabler) what to do. She suggested \"GitHub.\" I was informed there were \"open-source repos\" I could \"deploy.\" When I explained that I was a hippie who barely knows how to use a microwave, she offered to help me build one from scratch. I said, \"Why not?\"\n\nWhen I was younger, I read a short story by Kurt Vonnegut called *Harrison Bergeron*. It’s about a future where society forces equality by handicapping the exceptional: athletes wear heavy weights, and geniuses have implants that interrupt their thoughts. At the end of the story, Harrison throws off his shackles and embraces his limitless potential.\n\nIt took exactly 24 hours of solitude and a comatose dog for me to realize that **I had become Harrison Bergeron.**\n\nThe first pass at my visualizer was elegant, but it had no meaningful relationship with the music. It seemed unaware of the concept of \"rhythm.\" 12 hours later, Claude and I had reinvented the wheel. Our audio/physics engine was allegedly based on research from MIT, validated by a thorough scraping of every mention of “Beats by Dre” on TikTok.\n\nI wanted to share this [masterpiece](http://smv.club) with my homies, but Claude started talking about \"deployment\" again. I reminded her of my hippie status. Moments later, I had a registered domain and someone named \"Vercel\" was \"building\" my \"repo.\"\n\nUnfortunately, my real-life friends are all \"busy with their families\" and \"enjoying the holidays,\" so I am forced to come here to share my descent into digital madness.",

The consensus is that this is a top-tier, entertaining post.\n*   Many users are sharing their own \"Harrison Bergeron\" moments, feeling empowered by Claude to build projects (often with GitHub and Vercel) that they never thought possible.\n*   The Winamp nostalgia is real, sparking a side conversation about its mascot, Mike the Llama. For those confused, \"whipping the Llama's ass\" is a direct reference to the old Winamp slogan.\n*   OP confirmed the visualizer works with audio playing from your browser tab and that some bugs are still being squashed now that his wife is back and the dog is waking up.\n*   OP also shared a classic Claude moment: he called it a \"clanker,\" and it politely but firmly told him to use \"clanker,\" \"toaster,\" or \"bucket of bolts\" instead, but to skip \"clanka.\"",

BTW I also have to remove a lipoma but no one said I'd be doped with trazodone, maybe that's more for dogs not scratching?

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 50 comments.**\n\nAlright, let's break down this thread. The vibe is a mix of smug agreement and eye-rolling at the OP.\n\n**The consensus is that Claude Code is indeed the GOAT for serious coding**, with many users praising its ability to handle large, complex codebases better than competitors. Some are even jokingly trying to gatekeep it from the \"vibe coders\" to keep it good.\n\nHowever, the thread isn't just a love-in. The main debates are:\n\n*   **Elitism & Meme Misuse:** A lot of you are calling out the OP's \"superiority complex\" and, more importantly, that this isn't how the meme format works. The smart and dumb guy are supposed to be doing the *same* thing.\n*   **The Multimodal Debate (Claude vs. Gemini):** A major argument broke out over Claude's lack of image generation.\n    *   **Team Gemini:** Argues that this is a huge weakness, as images are vital for technical documentation like UML and architecture diagrams, making Gemini a better \"all-around beast.\"\n    *   **Team Claude:** Fires back that image gen is \"slop\" and a distraction. They advocate for using text-based Mermaid diagrams (which Claude can generate) for documentation, as they can be version-controlled. They want Anthropic to stay laser-focused on coding.\n*   **One Tool vs. The Toolbox:** There's a split on the best workflow.\n    *   Some power users insist you need a full toolbox, using Claude Code for its harness, Codex (GPT-5.2) for deep scientific problems, and Gemini for visuals.\n    *   Others argue Claude Code's tooling is so superior that it's the only thing they need for their work.\n*   **Is it free?** For the people asking: The Claude Code VSCode extension is free, but you need a paid Anthropic subscription to use the powerful models like Opus with it.",

GPT-5.2, if we're just talking results, is the better overall coding agent.  Opus-4.5 is the better frontend coder (given my experience with Next.JS & Astro).  However, Opus-4.5 does a lot of stuff on the backend halfway.  It's fast, but it doesn't do things properly/fully without being told to over and over.\n\nGemini-3-pro is by far the best at creating art, visual effects, etc.  I use it after the rest of the work is done to put the finishing touches on.\n\nAs I said though, it's not that one is always better than the other.  That's like saying a BMW 5-class is better than a tractor or a forklift.  Maybe, maybe not, depends what you're doing with it.  Sometimes you need a pickup truck and a backhoe to do your work, and you wouldn't force yourself into a silly choice of just picking one.",

The community is completely split and nobody can agree on what this tweet even means.\n\nThe top-voted take is that this is **less about Claude being a genius and more of an indictment of Google's slow, bureaucratic development process.** Basically, it says more about Google's problems than Claude's prowess.\n\nOther key debates in the thread:\n*   **Skepticism:** Many argue the hard part wasn't the coding, but the year of planning and getting everyone to agree. They think Claude just spat out one version, not the final, painstakingly-approved system.\n*   **The Positive View:** A smaller group sees this as a huge win, believing Claude successfully replicated a year's worth of iterative work in just an hour.\n*   **Bot Paranoia:** Several users are convinced this thread is swarming with bots, pointing to weird comments and voting patterns.\n*   **The X-Files:** A user got nuked with downvotes for posting the source link to X (Twitter), which started a whole other argument about whether it's dumb to downvote a source just because you hate the site.",

As the agentic time horizon increases we all need to practice how to get better at long time horizon planning.

They seem to be allowing Gemni to shell into banana, or how every you want to describe it. It shows up if you chat with it, it will \"decide\" to answer with a photo instead of text or sometimes blend text and image though that seems hit or miss.\n\nI have had it flip mid chat to bannana and get \"stuck\" in that mode. I got mad at it and said, \"Hey WTF? I was talking to normal Gemini. Your in bannana mode!\" to it, while in bannana mode and it flipped back to gemini and apologized for the mistake.",

I have an insane amount of guardrails, gate checks, code review processes, etc. etc. in Claude to make sure it generates high quality code. I have 30,000 unit tests across just these two frameworks, and I have special unit test writing systems in place that Claude uses to make sure it writes high quality tests, etc.  It's a system. This is how devs will operate from now on. We are orchestrators, designers and skilled tool users. Writing actual code by hand is literally the least productive way to develop now.",

Claude compressed the \"implementation\" phase from months to an hour, but that assumes you already have:\n\n\n\n1. Clear requirements\n\n2. Architectural decisions made\n\n3. API contracts defined\n\n4. Data models agreed upon\n\n\n\nThis is actually a huge win for engineers - it means we can focus more on the hard problems (system design, performance optimization, business logic) and less on the mechanical task of typing out implementations.\n\n\n\nThe real question: how do we structure our development process to maximize this leverage?",

I dug into how their agent actually works and open-sourced the core pattern.\n\nThe problem with AI agents: after many tool calls, they lose track of goals. Context gets bloated. Errors get buried. Tasks drift.\n\nManus's fix is stupidly simple — 3 markdown files:\n\n* `task_plan.md` → track progress with checkboxes\n* [`notes.md`](http://notes.md) → store research (not stuff context)\n* [`deliverable.md`](http://deliverable.md) → final output\n\nThe agent reads the plan before every decision. Goals stay in the attention window. That's it.\n\nI packaged this into a **Claude Code skill**. Works with the CLI. Install in 10 seconds:\n\n`cd ~/.claude/skills`\n\n`git clone` [`https://github.com/OthmanAdi/planning-with-files.git`](https://github.com/OthmanAdi/planning-with-files.git)\n\nMIT licensed. First skill to implement this specific pattern.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dkvk3d0uc3bg1.png?width=1329&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd3320c687aec02b3a7fa92fc3272485838a36f5\n\nCurious what you think — anyone else experimenting with context engineering for agents?",

Claude Code itself often creates its own `plan.md` files without being asked, and other open-source tools like Spec-kit and APM have implemented similar workflows for a while.\n\n*   **That $2B valuation ain't for 3 markdown files:** The community is highly skeptical of the \"reverse-engineering\" claim, with one user summing it up as \"asking Claude Code to copy Manus and it came up with a neat idea.\" The real value is likely in Manus's ability to use virtual machines and its massive revenue, not just a planning prompt.\n\n*   **There's a better way, anyway:** Several users pointed out a flaw in the logic. Writing to a `notes.md` file still stuffs the context with tool calls. The more advanced approach discussed in the thread is to use **subagents** to handle context-heavy tasks, keeping the main agent's context clean.",

I basically have a setup which can look at almost any website and build me a scraper module which plugs into my other script which runs all the scraped products through amazon and find me selling opportunities. Then i have another script which uses gpt to match the products using the titles and images and finally sends all results to sheets api and discord.",

Having hardcoded roles to agents of all kinds usually does not work because users have a diverse domain of projects they use AI for. BMADs pipeline would force you to a \"Design\" agent for example even if you are setting up a backend-only micro-service. \n\nIve done my research and I designed APM following principles that human teams follow irl. This is in general an emergent behavior on all new technology. If you take a step back and look exactly at what Spec-kit is, or native plan mode on all platforms etc ... its just a natural human behavior where you first plan your actions and then you perform them following your plan.\n\nVibe coding had no structure, it evolved into what we currently have which was kinda natural.",

              "text": "u/Lighting_squrriel78 This is a great question and honestly you're already thinking about it the right way. Let me break it down:\n\n**On your LP/Block/Module system:** What you've built is essentially a hierarchical knowledge base — that's smart. LP → Block → Module is a solid structure. The problem you're hitting (clogged txt file) is exactly what my skill tries to solve for Claude: externalizing memory so the model doesn't have to hold everything in context at once.\n\n**On switching to Claude:** Depends on your use case. Claude Code excels at coding and long-context reasoning. Gemini Pro has a massive context window (1M+ tokens) which might actually help with your 4000 LPs situation. If you're doing mostly coding/agent workflows, Claude Code + skills will serve you well. If you need to reference your entire LP library at once, Gemini's context might be more practical.\n\n**How I'd restructure your brain:**\n\n1. [**index.md**](http://index.md) — Master list of all modules and what they do (lightweight, always loaded first)\n2. **modules/\\*.md** — One file per module, only loaded when relevant to the current task\n3. **active\\_context.md** — The LPs/Blocks currently relevant RIGHT NOW (this is what the agent actually reads during work)\n4. **archive/** — Old/deprecated LPs that might be useful later but shouldn't clutter active work\n\nThe key insight from Manus: don't load everything  load *what's relevant right now*, and refresh it before every major decision, god i wish more things worked like modern data science!.\n\n**On using the Manus pattern with Gemini:** Absolutely. The 3-file pattern (plan, notes, deliverable) isn't Claude-specific. You could implement the same workflow in Gemini, Codex, or any agent. The principle is universal: externalize state, re-read before deciding, track progress visibly.\n\n**My honest advice:** Your LP system is impressive, but 4000 LPs in one file is fighting the architecture. Modularize it. Create a \"librarian\" prompt that knows how to find and load the right modules on demand. That's how Manus handles it not by stuffing everything into context, but by knowing *where* things are and pulling them in when needed.\n\nWould love to see what you build. Feel free to DM if you want to bounce ideas.",

How do you handle disagreements between them? Does GPT have veto power or is it advisory?\n\nVisionCraft for technical docs makes sense I've seen the MCP server, the 100k library coverage is solid for anything vision-related.\n\n30k tokens to initialize sounds heavy but if it's keeping everything on rails across a complex workflow, probably worth it. How long did it take you to get that system stable? I imagine there was a lot of iteration to get the guardrails right. am i wrong or am i false :D",

OP says they have filters, but veterans of similar projects are wishing them luck.\n\nOther key takeaways:\n*   Some users want a hint of location (like the sender's country) to make it feel more real, while others like the mystery.\n*   A few people are skeptical that Claude built the *entire* thing, graphics and all, but OP is sticking to their story.\n*   A minor bug was reported where rejected messages get deleted instead of letting you edit, and OP is looking into it.

OP is the one moving the camera.\n*   **Claude built its own bridge.** OP tasked Claude with writing the code for an MCP server and a websocket connection to link the code editor (JetBrains WebStorm) to OP's custom 3D editor.\n*   The 3D editor is OP's own project, which will be released soon at `kite3d.dev`.\n\nThe general vibe is that this is a mind-blowing demonstration of AI's rapid progress, with plenty of the usual jokes about Skynet. The few comments trying to downplay the achievement were downvoted to oblivion.",

      "text": "I never thought I'd say this but coding got boring.\n\nHere's my workflow now:\n\n1. Write a prompt\n2. Wait 15-30 minutes\n3. Review the code\n4. Ask for fixes\n5. Repeat\n\nThat's it. That's the job now.\n\nNo more debugging for hours. No more Stack Overflow rabbit holes. No more \"why the fuck isn't this working\" at 2 AM.\n\nJust... prompting. Reviewing. Prompting again.\n\nDon't get me wrong — I'm 10x more productive. Shipping things that would've taken weeks in days. But the thrill is gone.\n\nThe struggle was the fun part. Figuring it out. That moment when it finally works after 4 hours of pain.\n\nNow it just... works. First or second try.\n\nI became a code reviewer for an AI. A project manager who occasionally writes prompts.\n\nAnyone else feeling this? Or am I just romanticizing the suffering?",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 200 comments.**\n\nSorry OP, but the thread mostly disagrees with you.\n\n**The consensus is that you're romanticizing the suffering and that AI makes coding *more* enjoyable.** Most devs here feel it kills the tedious parts (debugging, boilerplate, Stack Overflow rabbit holes) and lets them focus on the actual fun: high-level architecture, creative problem-solving, and shipping products faster. It's about *creating*, not just coding.\n\nA key theme is the \"product dev\" vs. \"code purist\" split. If you love building the product, you're thrilled. If you love the nitty-gritty puzzle of the code itself, you're probably bored like OP.\n\nYou're not totally alone, though. Several users agree they miss the dopamine hit of a tough debug and now feel like \"project managers for an AI.\"\n\nFinally, a reality check from the trenches: You still have to be a hawk-eyed code reviewer. Claude can write repetitive mush and has the memory of a goldfish, so the advice is to prompt small features one at a time, not entire apps.",

The approach above made wonders to my workflow. I never face the problem of \"I think faster than I type\" anymore. I believe we're about to have new meta documented in the next 5 years in terms of how to work productively and a lot of patterns would change. 5-10 times more productive is a real thing for me, and I was already very productive before.

So, I'm no a stranger to LLMs, but I don't really get into this agentic/sub-agentic topic.\n\nBut the thing that I see consistently through all of posts from people who seems to be experienced around - you need to get a lot of context and specifications to LLM to get plausible result. And this is the point where I don't get this whole process. \n\nI just don't understand how writing detailed description and task definition for LLM to anchor it and create context can be faster than actual implementation by hand. So far I consistently avoid delegating my tasks to junior-level engineers simply because they act in a very same way as LLM would act - have no idea where to look for context, reinvent bicycle because they where not aware that it already exist and then create a solution that on surface would look like it solved a problem, but in reality it's very far away from it.\n\nAlternative would be actually writing a good documentation, do a full-fat onboarding, map infrastructure, and explain tasks, goals and success criteria in a very detailed way, but it would just make me or other senior engineer to overspend our limited time budget.\n\nSo, actual and genuine questions from me, curious guy - is it really worth, and does it really save time if you are already experienced developer? Do you get speed benefits if you already have good knowledge of task, environment and utilize LLM surgically for chores like test generation, boilerplate, duplicating stuff, or merging methods? If it really does save time, do you spend time reviewing output? If yes, does it still save time? Or can you trust LLM to really cover all of your requirements and produce serviceable, readable code that could be either tweaked by human, or be easily understood by LLM in subsequent runs?",

It retrieves the description from the MCP, ingests a bunch of code or logs or whatever, and proposes an initial plan. I might end up correcting it (e.g. \"that's not how X works, you should do Y instead\"). The work of figuring out what to grep for is gone.\n\n\nMind you, I'm talking about the non-coding part.

We have a lot of guard rails in place however Claude and any other AI can ignore them or what it mostly does is create some new function outside of the scope and break other parts of your software. As for no more debugging, I feel like you haven't gone big enough. Claude cant debug an issue that is not an issue, its working as intended but not and you get that a lot in complicated software.\n\nI have 20+ years experience as a developer and I have to say SaaS products are done. I work for a huge company which is not a software company, instead of buying SaaS products we are building our own in house something that they never thought they could do until now. \n\nAnd I love it because you have tones of non-techy departments having ideas and requesting if this or that could be made to solve this or that problem.

My work involves designing non trivial algorithms and I deal with a lot of massive directed graph which requires solid algorithms to process constantly changing graph. No AI model has been able to help come up or even brainstorm or just help get to the finish line by helping me fill those missing gaps in my logic. They just don’t understand the nature of the domain and algorithms I have to deal with. It can take weeks to completely reason through the nature of the graphs I deal with and design fast algorithms. Other than trivial things in it and documentation to explain my logic with my team, I have not seen any improvements in my workflow no matter what prompting or tricks I try. May be it’s due to the complexity around my work but AI hasn’t been helpful to me when it comes to that.

They're an excellent sounding board. When I ask them to build something, however: slop every time! Needless flourishes, extra boilerplate code, unused functions, poor test coverage. It's unmaintainable and I need to edit aggressively, taking 8-10 passes at each feature until it's good enough to merge.\n\nSometimes I wonder if I'd be better off doing it the old fashioned way, but one advantage I'll still give to LLM-assisted coding: it bypasses writer's block entirely. The beastie vomits out code which I review, harangue, and pick apart. It uses different muscles than I'm used to flexing when I do IC work; I'm a reviewer all the time now.\n\nI know this is an Anthropic sub but I've got to mention that Opus and Sonnet 4.5 are not making the grade; I find myself using ChatGPT 5.2 frequently for requirements and design, and frequently initial implementation of the tricky bits.

Or, fine tuning it for coding can make it worse at reasoning. (Yes, this shot is being fired at GPT Codex!)\n\nOver about 15 months of using agents every day (I know, how hipster of me!) there are certain shibboleths that they still can't solve: concurrency via message passing, orderly shutdown with signals, grammar-to-AST relationships, and structural/semantic/runtime correspondence of the same idea, to name some things from my current project. Models have gotten much better at reasoning but they remain constantly bad with these shibboleth topics.\n\nSparsity of training data may explain it partially; there's a lot more web stuff out there than language stuff, and there's a surprising variety of language stuff.\n\nIt's also a certainty, however, that all systems have limits and it's possible that generative auto-regressive models simply can't \"solve\" for some classes of input. The AI community is already grappling with discovering what comes next once LLMs plateau.\n\nI'm 10x as effective as I was before on some tasks and more of my time is free to focus on the LLM-resistant stuff, so it's still a win, but I'm not betting that they'll come to do everything.

I might have to chase/fix other bugs, but I have not experienced a single compiler error since using Claude Code. CC is a hell of a lot slower, but I’ve saved so much time chasing build errors.

With the Google Ads CSVs I create for my clients, I give it a few of the previous examples I have used and reviewed and let it build off of that. If you weren't sure about the CSV part, Google Ads Editor allows you to upload the CSVs to it, and it makes publishing campaigns super easy.\n\nAnother thing I do is I build out certain chats that only talk about ads and the ad process, etc. I do this to prevent any hallucinations and keep it focused. Like, I wouldn't have it build out campaigns, ask it tax questions, and start building out campaigns again. I've found it is better to stay super on topic to ensure your results don't get corrupted with things you don't want it outputting.",

It seems like half the sub also built a retirement planner with Claude, and **they all look almost exactly the same.** Apparently, Claude has a default \"vibe-coded\" color palette and UI that it loves to use for these kinds of apps.\n\nFor the tech-savvy, OP explained their process: they used the web UI to brainstorm and generate a `prompt.md` file, then unleashed Claude Code on it. All your data is stored locally in your browser. The thread is also full of great feature requests like adding pensions, customizable tax settings, and better mobile support, which OP is considering.

When I was a financial advisor *many* moons ago, we used a VERY similar tool to talk to our clients!\n\nI have such a stupid critique (and I probably will just fork off and play with the code base myself!) but: there are two features that, to me, would end up making this truly a 'ready for primetime' financial planning tool.\n\nThe first is very nit picky - if you FIRE (or just Retire Early), there's a lot of value in converting 401ks (sometimes up to the tax limit) in some of those early years when your income is exceptionally low and you will otherwise get hit with big, angry RMDs later on. There's also value in leaving Roth accounts alone for as long as possible - because by letting them sit you maximize the tax benefits. I'm not sure exactly what I'm asking for here - maybe allowing the user to modify the *source* of withdrawls after the Retirement phase is calculated? Also, would be totally baller to see 72T withdrawal suggestions/options as well.\n\nThese are totally edge cases, though. For MOST people your current codebase is absolutely fantastic.\n\nThe second is significantly more complicated - basically, it would be interesting to 'stress test' the portfolio, either against historical data, or against multiple (i.e. Monte Carlo type scenario) simulated market scenarios. What's the survival rate? If I retired with my current portfolio projections in 2008, what would that look like? I want to avoid having to go 'back to work' at 75, even in a 'worst case scenario'.\n\nThose are huge asks/critiques. Also - *insurance* planning would be a good/useful feature, although actually out of scope for what you've built.\n\nReally great work though - a fantastic (and cool!) tool!",

It does surprisingly well at refactorings (at my direction). I've occasionally asked it to review for OOP practices, component reuse, and so on. It's pretty good at identifying and prioritizing these opportunities, then executing on them, as directed.\n\nFor my purposes, the tool replaced a spreadsheet that I have built and been using for the last several years. I reached this MVP in about 6 hrs. after my first installation of CC.\n\nWhile impressive, I think there's a risk. It makes building this sort of software much more accessible, but that can easily loosen the adherence to best practices in many domains. Someone without a software background or domain expertise could easily make bad software that looks like it should do the job but does it in a poor manner that isn't supported by best practices.\n\nAlong the way, Claude has made a number of mistakes. I've had to review behavior pretty closely to make sure that various figures are factored in appropriately and that a healthy quantity of tests back up the development.",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 100 comments.**\n\nAlright, let's break it down. The top comments are calling BS, comparing this to a **\"shovel seller claiming he only uses his own shovels to make new shovels\"** or the Coca-Cola CEO claiming to only drink Coke. Most of the thread is skeptical of the headline at face value.\n\nHowever, the more nuanced consensus is that the claim is likely true, but it redefines what \"contribution\" means. The key takeaway is that **this signals a fundamental shift in the developer's role from a code *writer* to a code *director*.**\n\n*   **The Human is the Architect:** Users argue the dev is still doing the heavy lifting of planning, designing architecture, defining the problem, and making high-level decisions. Claude is just the tool that types out the implementation.\n*   **It's Not \"One-Shot\" Magic:** Experienced users confirm they get 80-100% of their code from Claude, but it's not easy. It requires a massive upfront investment in planning and a complex workflow involving test-driven development (TDD), review agents, and constant supervision.\n*   **Claude Still Goofs:** Many point out that Claude still makes silly mistakes, gets stuck in loops, and chooses poor architectural patterns. A knowledgeable human is essential to catch these errors and get the AI back on track.\n*   **It's Called \"Dogfooding\":** Several users note that of course an Anthropic employee would be using their own tool 100% of the time. It's their job to find the rough edges and bugs (and according to one comment, there are ~6,500 open issues, so there's plenty to find).\n\nSo, the verdict is: **The claim is probably not a lie, but it's not the \"AGI is here\" moment some think it is.** The human is still very much in the driver's seat; they've just traded their keyboard for a prompt box.",

They are also free to do a lot more conscious and deliberate design decisioning. \n\nBut, I'm not going to lie, the first 4 months of this was rough. Getting your feet under you takes some effort. It's a shift in thinking. You basically need every engineer to be one part management, one part PM, one part architect and one part engineering lead. The engineers that can do that absolutely smoke everyone else. The engineers that can't... Well... Don't. \n\nThis year one thing became increasingly clear to me: the ability to organize and manage will be core engineering skills within the next 24 months. The introvert engineer that just wants to be left alone to tinker is going to get shut out unless they adapt. AI development actually requires MORE face time, not less. Otherwise you get some dude mangling a database at hyper speed, instead of steady, predictable, secure and quality code coming at a high velocity. Engineering becomes more about discussion, design, decisions and oversight than being the code ninja. And.. honestly... To those who didn't already know it, it already was and has been for years. Look at the highest ranking engineers in your company. They aren't locking themselves up and then popping up with brand new tools and products that they miraculously made. They spend at least half their time in meetings and writing documents. Policies, diagrams, decision logs, proposals, data justifications, metric reporting, etc. All of which turns into directives that turned into prompts handed to you to go implement. They have been the engineer. YOU were the coding agent. Plan your future accordingly. Good luck and happy hunting.",

So rather than letting all that compute lay dormant they used it to \n\n1. Create goodwill with their community.  Everyone likes free stuff, and this cost Anthropic next to nothing.\n2. Get people talking about Anthropic/Claude on social media.\n3. Give people a free chance to up their limits, showing how much more they could do on a higher tier plan: Pro to Max 5, or Max 5 to Max 20. And then seriously consider moving to that tier.\n4. Let people be productive on their personal projects at home while off work.\n\nThere are probably other benefits I haven't considered.\n\nBut well done. ",

Just that everyone agrees with OP: **the 2x Christmas usage was a brilliant, if painful, marketing move.**\n\nThe thread is basically a confession booth for people who got hooked. Many of you went on a coding/writing bender, running multiple terminals and now find yourselves staring at the 'Upgrade to Max' button, wallet in hand. Some of you already pulled the trigger.\n\nThe \"painful\" part comes from the realization that **the standard $20 Pro plan feels completely unusable now.** The overwhelming consensus is that the 2x promo level should be the new default, with many calling the current Pro plan a \"gateway drug\" that's just not strong enough.\n\nA few of you are still skeptical, pointing out that more tokens don't fix Claude's occasional hallucinations or suspecting this was a 'psyop' to make a future limit reduction less noticeable. But that's a minority view. The main vibe is: Anthropic played you all like a fiddle, and most of you are thanking them for it while begging for more.",

          "text": "I also feel like the Pro plan is basically just a gateway drug. When you have the Pro plan, you can only do a few things per day with LLMs in the web interface. As soon as you start using Claude in your code editor with a few slash commands and seriously do some work in VS Code, even if it's not continuous coding applications or bigger projects, you're already struggling with the 4-hour window where you work for half an hour and then sit around for three hours doing nothing because you've already hit your limit for the period. The weekly window is usually exhausted by mid-week without you really having done much. So that's genuinely pretty frustrating, and the fact that there's nothing in between the Pro and Max plans is also a shame. I've said it elsewhere before, but double the amount of resources in Pro, like we had between Christmas and New Year, would actually be an acceptable expectation for the Pro plan. Then you could actually get some work done, and the serious coders would need to upgrade to the Max plan, but a normal person could live with the Pro plan. But the Pro plan is so limited that you basically can't manage with it. At that point you might as well not bother at all and better invest your 20 Bugs into Gemini... you definitly get more value for the bug",

Most users agree that benchmarks are generally unreliable and don't reflect real-world performance.\n\nThat being said, the thread is full of devs who **agree Claude is an amazing coding assistant** that has significantly improved their workflow. However, performance is seen as inconsistent, with some users reporting a recent dip in quality and sparking the usual \"we're being A/B tested\" theories.\n\nA whole side-debate also broke out between devs who feel like a \"20x engineer\" with Claude and senior engineers who argue it's just a \"force multiplier\" (a powerful tool), not a replacement for real expertise and architectural thinking.",

              "text": "Mine answered the same Q like this:\n\n\"You are right to anchor on what we know (Opus 4.5) and be cautious about overhyping what comes next. Before I speculate, let’s question the assumptions that often distort these forecasts:\n\n\t1.\tWe assume a linear quality uplift (4.5 gets better, so 4.7 must be significantly better). That is not always how models improve. Sometimes enhancements are incremental, sometimes they shift focus (efficiency, safety, cost).\n\n\t2.\tWe assume all improvements are visible to end users. Many upgrades happen under the hood and don’t dramatically change day-to-day use, especially between minor versions.\n\n\t3.\tWe assume Opus 4.7 will exist on the same trajectory as past versions. Strategic priorities, compute cost, and safety calibration can alter that path.\n\nGiven those caveats, here are realistic capabilities I would expect from something like Opus 4.7 if it follows typical model development patterns:\n\ncore language quality\n\n\t•\tbetter contextual reasoning over longer text sequences. Opus 4.5 is capable but still can lose track over very long conversations. A 4.7 could maintain coherence significantly longer.\n\n\t•\tfewer hallucinations through improved grounding heuristics (not perfect elimination, but measurable reduction).\n\nefficiency and cost\n\n\t•\tsame answer quality with lower compute, meaning cheaper API usage or faster latency.\n\n\t•\tadaptive compute so simpler queries use smaller internal sub-models.\n\ntask performance\n\n\t•\tstronger performance on domain-specific tasks without fine-tuning, such as legal reasoning, programming, and mathematics.\n\n\t•\tmore robust multi-turn planning where the model splits tasks into intermediate steps more reliably.\n\nalignment and safety\n\n\t•\ttighter control to avoid problematic content, better boundary recognition, and more nuanced refusal behaviors.\n\n\t•\tbuilt-in safety heuristics that reduce the need for external filters in many cases.\n\nmultimodal capability\n\n\t•\tsmoother integration of mixed inputs (text + audio + image) with higher semantic precision, if the architecture supports it.\n\n\t•\tmemory improvements so the model can recall user preferences more reliably within a session.\n\ntool use and plugins\n\n\t•\tbetter interaction with external tools (search, calculators, databases), possibly with dynamic tool selection based on query complexity.\n\nwhere things might not improve as much as expected\n\ncreativity\n\n\t•\tquality of creative outputs may not drastically exceed 4.5; often improvements are subtle rather than dramatic.\n\n\t•\tsubjective tasks (tone, style preferences) improve through better prompting rather than model version change.\n\ntrue understanding\n\n\t•\tthe model will still lack grounded real-world experience or genuine understanding. It will still be pattern driven with statistical association at its core.\n\ncost and access\n\n\t•\thigher performance models often come with higher pricing tiers. Don’t assume 4.7 will be cheap at launch.\n\nopportunity cost question\n\nIs chasing the hypothetical 4.7 the best focus right now? If you are building products or integrations, refining your prompts and user experience with the current 4.5 might yield more immediate impact than waiting for a new version. Improvement in tooling, evaluation, and grounding often outpaces what you get from a new model drop.\n\nIn summary, Opus 4.7 will likely be better at reasoning, context, safety, and efficiency, without magically crossing the threshold to true general intelligence. The practical gains will be real but measured.\"",

The user is not always right, in fact most of the time the user is incorrect or misunderstanding the subject. Yet LLM's today will frequently agree with the users proposal and go hell for leather to do build a solution.\n3. The 2nd brings me on to my 3rd point. LLM's are reward based systems. They are rewarded for providing solutions. Regardless if a solution is needed or not. This is an issue where if you provide it with the most perfect math equation, I'm almost certain it will tell you to fix/update xyz. If you then update xyz based on the feedback, and feed that updated equation to a fresh window, it will find issues and tell you to update xyz. It's an infinite award work loop.",

The AI DJ's monologues are a highlight, especially when it rambles on about the importance of silence... without taking a breath.\n\nThat said, it's a bit buggy. The community has reported:\n*   The 24/7 station goes offline or disconnects.\n*   The track name doesn't always update or match the song playing (shoutout to when it labeled Britney Spears as classical music).\n*   People are requesting features like a volume control, song info/links, and album art.\n\nFor everyone asking: **OP has confirmed they will be open-sourcing the project** and sharing the code on GitHub. A few users have raised questions about music licensing, but for now, everyone's just enjoying the vibes.",

A lot of users argue that Claude is a professional tool and the higher-tier plans are a bargain for the value they provide, so people should just upgrade if they need more. However, many agree with OP that the jump from Pro is steep, especially for hobbyists or users in countries with lower wages, and that the temporary 2X boost was the perfect sweet spot. The idea that Anthropic \"only wants B2B customers\" was brought up and promptly shot down.\n\n**For those looking for a middle ground, the community has a few suggestions:**\n\n*   **The most popular solution: Use multiple Pro accounts.** You can either just log out and log in to a second account, or use a proxy like Better CCFlare to load-balance requests between them.\n*   Another option is to stick with the Pro plan and top up with pay-as-you-go API credits, but be sure to set a spending cap.\n\n**Do NOT just switch to the API.** The consensus is that it's *way* more expensive for this kind of usage than the subscription plans.",
