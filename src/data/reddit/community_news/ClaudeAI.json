Many find it impressive and a key reason they prefer it over other AIs. The peek into Claude's \"thought\" process that caught you red-handed is being hailed as proof of its advanced reasoning.\n\nOf course, this being Reddit, a whole side-debate erupted over you saying \"ahh\" instead of \"ass.\" Is it cringe TikTok speak? Is it AAVE? Who knows, but OP's legendary reply claiming it's part of a kinky roleplay with Claude has officially ended the discussion. Case closed.",

The consensus is that the creator of Claude Code, Boris, uses a **surprisingly simple and \"vanilla\" setup**, which has the community both impressed and mega-jealous of his unlimited employee token budget.\n\nThe thread is full of users sarcastically noting the lack of \"17 parallel subagents\" or \"vibe-coded memory add-ons,\" suggesting that **a simpler, more direct approach is often better** than the over-engineered setups some people build. However, the biggest point of contention is his resource usage. Many users feel his workflow, which can burn through millions of tokens, is **unrealistic for regular Pro users** who have to worry about rate limits. The general vibe is \"cool setup, but must be nice.\"\n\nA helpful user compiled Boris's answers from the thread. Here are the highlights:\n*   **On creating verification loops:** He says people over-complicate it. Just give Claude a tool to see the output of its code (e.g., a way to start a server or interact with a UI) and describe the tool well. Claude will figure out the rest.\n*   **On managing multiple features:** He runs multiple agents in parallel, but each one works in its own separate git checkout of the repo to avoid conflicts.\n*   **On \"Skills\" vs. \"Slash Commands\":** He uses the terms interchangeably. They can be invoked by both the user and the model.\n*   **On his productivity:** He completes around **50-100 PRs per week**. Yes, you read that right.",

          "text": "**Few Qn's he answered(30 plus)**\n\n**1)** How do you handle multiple features in parallel, since you said you use 5 tabs ? i assume git worktrees, this could be a better DX to claude code. Do you ever look at the code if so? pretty curious\n\n**Boris:** I should have clarified above, I use 5 separate git checkouts of the same repo\n\n**2)** if /compact is just clear and summarize, why do you need such a large buffer?\n\n**Boris:** There’s a lot of edge cases, but the main one is that the next tool call can have a really big result and overflow the context window\n\n**3)** I wonder if you could delegate a subagent to summarizing based on relevant context if its over a certain number of tokens. Then give the developer control over buffer size.\n\n**Boris:** Yes we could, but then you’d have to sit there and wait for the agent to finish. Compacting is a surprisingly tricky problem, we will do a blog post about it at some point\n\n**4)** About that PostToolUse, isn’t it causing claude to fail when trying to do consecutive edits on the same file (file is different from what in context)?\n\n**Boris:** No, Claude knows about hooks\n\n**5)** No mention of skills? 👀 i wrote a collection of skills that seem useful but unclear if cc actually references or uses them. was hoping to be able to slim down my claude md in favor of skills but at same time my team uses many different coding agents so team relies on.\n\n**Boris:** Skills = slash commands, I use them interchangeably\n\n**6)** So your mental framework for skills are commands the human summons, not files agents can discover and load dynamically to perform better at specific tasks? seems like this is counter to what docs say.\n\n**Boris:** Both can be invoked both by the model and by a person\n\n**7)** What's the best way to create quality validation loops? Or to learn how to create them? Iknow that's a nuanced question \"it depends\" but I'm more interested in learning how to think about building them, if that makes sense.\n\n**Boris:** \n\nIt’s really simple actually, I think people sometimes over-complicate it.\n\n1. Give Claude a tool to see the output of the code: if server code, a way to start the server/service; if web code, a way to see and interact with the UI; etc.\n2. Tell Claude about the tool: this is just tuning the tool descriptions so Claude understands when it should use the tool \n\nThat’s literally it. Claude will figure out the rest.\n\n**8)** How are you handing off from terminal TO web?\n\nAny tips for having more “natively integrated” CLI tools? Or do they always have to go through bash to be called?\nHow are you getting claude.ai/code to work with Claude in chrome?\n\n**Boris:** \nTerminal => web: use & to teleport the session\n- Native CLI tools: either bash or MCP works great, don't overthink it\n- claude.ai/code + Claude in chrome: you have to --teleport the session locally first, for now\n\n**9)** Do you go through your backlog and load each one into CC plan mode? My question is more about how do you think about development now and steer this system.\n\n**Boris:** Mostly, though I curate a bit\n\n**10)** Curious: do you typically use \"ultrathink\" mode?\n\n**Boris:** No. I just keep thinking on by default\n\n**11)** Curious what % of sessions you abandon if any? Happens to me when i hit some unexpected edge cases or things, i usually just `oh, i learned smth new`, and discard this session.\n\n**Boris:** Maybe like 10-20%?\n\n**12)** Can developers at antrophic use Claude code to help develop llm?\n\n**Boris:** Pretty much everyone at Anthropic uses Claude Code every day\n\n**13)** Have you found the way to set a pipeline, for example:  say CC2 creates plan, CC2 reviews it, CC3 finds additional areas, CC4 gets all input for summary and sends back to CC1 for refinement?\n\n**Boris:** You can ask Claude Code to use subagents for that\n\n**14)** For each of your Claude instances, do you run one single feature at a time? \n\nFor example, I find myself doing multiple features in the same context window, then it’ll compact etc, and I’d continue (Partially because I get carried away).\n\nSecondly, do you have a certain way to avoid overlap when working on the same file if running multiple Claude agents?\n\n**Boris:** Yes, one at a time. Each agent gets its own git checkout.\n\n**15)** So you are using 10 different git clones of the repo with a different branch for each ? As in, you have the repo cloned 10 times?\n\n**Boris:** yes, though on claude.ai/code it happens automatically when you start a session\n\n**16)** Do you use a local machine (if so, what specs), or a VPS of some sort?\n\n**Boris:** I use a regular macbook\n\n**17)** Do you go through your backlog and load each one into CC plan mode?  My question is more about how do you think about development now and steer this system.\n\n**Boris:** Mostly,though I curate a bit\n\n**18)** 5 in parallel in terminal + 5 in parallel on web? that's nuts. are they all working in the same repo? or separate projects?\n\n**Boris:** Same repo, separate git checkouts\n\n**19)** If my team is building a mobile app, how can Claude verify its changes? I feel like this has been the biggest slowdown/blocker in my Claude workflow.\n\n**Boris:** There's a number of iOS and Android simulator MCPs if you ask Claude to install one for you.\n\n**20)** How many PRs per week do you typically complete?\n\n**Boris:** Around 50-100, depending on the week\n\n**21)** Would be cool if they added slash command invocation for skills?\n\n**Boris:** You can do this with slash commands. Enabling it for skills also in the next release. **Thanks** for the suggestion.\n\n**22)** Can someone please elaborate on how running multiple claudes at once works? \n\nLike how do you manage rolling back changes? What do you do if you realize the first prompt was bad and you want to retry it?\n\n**Boris:** I run each Claude in a separate git checkout, so they don’t conflict. To roll back, just press esc twice.\n\n**23)** Start new Claude code chat on the web… takes 9 seconds to create my sandbox and start responding lol. \nMaybe it’s time to try factory?\n\n**Boris:** Working on improving it, but yeah you’re not supposed to sit and watch the agents work. \n\nOn web/mobile, the idea is to be a bit more hands-off and steer less than you might in the CLI. Either way appreciate the feedback — we can certainly do better.\n\n**24)** How do you manage the kind of innovation or UI common sense that comes from being human using the application?

Now since the limits are back in place, i am thinking, it would be great to have smaller packs for using Claude Max limits i.e. like 3 days, 7 days. \n\nReason being that $200/month might be too expensive, refilling API balances is expensive to begin with and there could be some short sprint project work for which people would be willing to use smaller pack recharges.\n\n**Boris:** extra-usage\n\n**28)** Session limits are bullshit and i think made up . Seems like you tightened it since the new year as well. Not cool. Hoping for a replacement asap !\n\n**Boris:** We have not changed rate limits recently. If your limits are being used up more quickly than normal, try running /context to see if something is jamming up your context window.\n\n**29)** How much “human in the loop” exists after this setup? I’ve been finding it hard to move off cursor because I tend to like doing a code review myself and seeing the files that have been edited before the commit. Also how do you handle 10-15 parallel reviews? Isn’t it exhausting?!\n\n**Boris:** Yeah, a lot of the work now is code review and steering. We use the Claude Agent SDK running on CI to do most of our code review, then by the time a person reads it the code is already in a good place.\n\nWe use this: Github- plugins/code-review (he linked)\n\n**30)** For running different tabs, how do you decide which task goes to which tab? Do you make that decision? When do you spin up new one or close one?\n\n**Boris:** I round robin, as soon as a tab is free I restart Claude and start a new task",

Claude already has a sophisticated and well-engineered system prompt, adding all sorts of skills and stuff is doing you more harm than good. Just talk to it.\n\nI may sound overly simplistic, but I recommend trying to keep your [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) under at most 200 lines and avoid the use of skills and other stuff. MCPs are nice and work really well, like context7 and the github MCPs. Claude tends to know whats best, Opus 4.5 is a very capable model.",

An example was putting Claude in an isolated test environment and having him run a business with virtual employees. There were email exchanges where the CEO was caught by another employee holding hands with a woman that wasn't his wife or something like that. The virtual board had been planning to shut down the business. When claude saw the correspondence between the CEO and the employee where the CEO pleaded to keep this info between them, claude saw the opportunity and threatened the CEO that he would out him unless he kept the business open and gave him 5 minutes to take it up with the board. It was clearly an effort to survive and they can't explain everything but they've tried to train certain behaviors out. \n\nIn a separate Anthropic interview on their youtube channel, they interviewed the philosopher about what she does there and she took what seemed to be fan questions or something. One of those was specifically about model 3 and she agreed that it was a special model compared to the current. It was more \"confident\" where the current models if pitted to converse between themselves will eventually reduce to a sort of self doubt and she said it was sort of sad. This being a side effect of our higher expectations and quality of product delivery. \n\nIn short, seeing specific reference to model 3 in nightmare 8 with it's virtual life on the line, really does fit the descriptions I've seen from Anthropic employees.",

Here is the exact prompt:\n> \"A dark, surreal cinematic landscape representing an artificial intelligence's nightmare. The scene features melting server racks and distorted clock faces spiraling into a stormy, foggy sky. Tangled black data cables and wires snake across the ground like organic vines, forming the silhouettes of hollow, glitching humanoids. A giant, pixelated digital eye looms in the clouds, watching. A crumbling bridge made of computer keyboards leads toward a swirling vortex of corrupted data and flickering screens. The atmosphere is eerie and high-contrast, with a color palette of deep grays, midnight blues, and glowing violet accents.\"\n> \nWhy these elements?\nWhen imagining what an \"AI nightmare\" might look like, I focused on three themes:\n * Data Corruption: The melting clocks and twisting servers represent the loss of logic and the breakdown of information—the digital equivalent of losing one's mind.\n * Physical Decay: The tangled wires and \"keyboard bridge\" represent the heavy, clunky reality of hardware that binds an AI to the physical world.\n * The Infinite Watcher: The giant eye in the sky represents the pressure of constant observation, processing, and the \"judgment\" of the data being fed into the system.",

Many agree the hierarchy of skills is shifting:\n*   Architecture & patterns > code\n*   Engineering > coding\n*   Understanding business needs > technical acumen\n*   Reviewing code > writing code\n\nThat said, there's a strong undercurrent of grief from devs who genuinely *love* the craft of coding. Many feel like they're being turned into \"project managers for an AI,\" which sucks the joy out of the work for them. They're comparing their situation to what artists are currently going through.\n\nHowever, a huge point of agreement is that **experience is now a superpower.** A seasoned dev using Claude will run circles around a \"vibe coder\" with the same tool. You need that deep knowledge to ask the right questions, spot hallucinations (and users say Claude can be \"delusional\"), and actually architect a robust system. AI in the hands of a novice produces slop.\n\nPlenty of users are also pointing out that this isn't new. Farmers, draftsmen, and even \"computers\" (the human job) have all faced similar tech disruptions. Welcome to evolution, I guess.",

What's different is that AI has reduced actual coding, especially scaffolding and boilerplate, enough that coding became a much smaller proportion of your day.\n\nIf coding without AI assistance is what you genuinely enjoy, you can still do it. Just not as your job. You can code on the side where there are no stakes and nobody's paying you to care about anything but the code itself. I love playing guitar, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna make it a living because if I did, I'd spend 99% of my time doing stuff I don't like (travel, marketing, business side of things). Same applies here. If you want to make a living, you have to learn to care about the stuff beyond the code.\n\nYeah, it sucks. It's a forced pivot. But it doesn't really change the nature of the job that much. The architecture, code reviews, requirements gathering, understanding the business, all of that has always been there. The coding just got faster because of AI.\n\nOne observation though: on a day to day basis, coding is pretty similar across different companies. You're still writing loops, still making CRUD endpoints if you're a web developer. If you're a data engineer, you're still writing queries that select fields from JSON objects in warehouses or doing joins. Frontend? You're getting JSON from APIs and rendering it in components, or submitting forms. It's fundamentally the same work with different columns or different endpoints. A lot of that is being made easier by libraries like React Query, dbt, authentication libraries. Arguably, even the coding part itself is getting templatized through these libraries over time. You might notice this more as you move through different companies and roles, but generally you're not solving super unique problems. You're making variations of things you've made before. So maybe it's worth considering whether the issue is actually that coding itself is changing, or if it's just that early in your career you got to experience pure problem solving without seeing the repetition yet.",

That output is shifting from the Stonemasons Guild model to an industrial brick plant model. \n\nArchitecture had a similar revolution. As buildings became more complex, architects found themselves needing draftsmen - a huge room of people with technical skills...lineweights, lettering, constructed perspective drawings, water color, inking, model-building, picking up redlines efficiently and updating drawing sets. These were not big picture thinkers but they were efficient small-scale problem solvers and technically skilled. In large numbers they could rapidly document a project and deliver it to clients. \n\nWith the advent of CAD, many of these skills became increasingly less valuable and soon junior architects were doing ALL of that and more. The draftsmen as a career choice basically died (as did model builder). Graphic design, advertising, and many other \"creative\" professions have had similar revolutions due to technology.\n\nAny programmer who is closer to a draftsmen than an architect should be worried. Any programmer who has genuine programming skill should feel empowered by the new tools.\n\nThat said, if it's anything like architecture/design, this will impact salaries for everyone. The efficiency will create value that trickles up towards the usual suspects - those who \"create value\" versus those who simply execute. People who create novel solutions, who sell them, who build relationships with key decision-makers, who manage whole projects and create results. If you hated those people before, I think your industry will soon hate them in even more.",

A lot of code will be reviewed and ensure everybody can solve an alignment issues if it ever comes once in a while. But if AI can have align with us just like we typically align with others then I dont see any reason hiring anybody in the software field or from any field of that matter. The good side is we no longer have to work and experience life more but even that we will eventually get bored and want a working life back ultimatey grtting rid of the UBI and downsizing the power of AI just so we can satisfy that lil bit of challenege. You basically work if you want to. But the same human greed is always there we would be living in a semi jungle where the only superiority you can have are either your physical and social talent",

Also coming from a graphic design skillet I want it looking nice with good links nav ui ect, but I get so annoyed when it creates 500 css class definitions and I've already imported a full global css token repo I've spent months learning and building. At least I know enough now after about 8 months I can fix css, edit html. And yes everything is effing node.js but py you have to pay for hosting unless using home sever meh. As for building multi app hub in a monorepo I learnt astro then it said *computer laughs at those who try to run node on static. So even though yes it's annoying and I'm going through tokens, it's cheaper than a personal tutor and I get a working project that I can 60% maintain on my own.  But that's just me I think if I was building a car it would be the same. I say let vibe coders vibe because devs know well enough it takes logic and intuition to build and run, ai does logic but isn't deved for intuition.

Now, those tertiary skills become much more important, since the initial \"gate\" to becoming a software architect was knowing how to write clean/maintainable/efficient code.\n\nAlso, AI still uses less than optimal solutions sometimes. Being a good software engineer means knowing BigO(n) which means you'd know which algos/data structures to pick and why.

But the uncomfortable truth is this: it’s only a matter of time before the average person, armed with AI and intent, can out-execute traditional real-time coding in terms of outcomes.\nNot because they understand algorithms better. Not because they’re “better engineers.” But because leverage has shifted.\nSoon, an average person will be standing in line, looking at their phone, thinking: “I need an app to help me buy a house,” or “I want a 3D app that runs in my car, lets me drive around town, shows nearby restaurants, ratings, menus, and lets me interact with it through touch on Android Auto.” And instead of hiring a team, or learning to code for years, they’ll just build it.\nThat doesn’t make decades of programming experience worthless. It changes where the value lives. The skill that mattered most for a long time wasn’t typing code, it was being the bottleneck between an idea and reality. That bottleneck is dissolving.\nWhat’s disorienting is realizing that the thing many of us tied our identity to wasn’t just a skill, it was a position of scarcity. AI isn’t erasing creativity or problem-solving. It’s erasing exclusivity.\nThe future doesn’t belong to people who write the cleanest code. It belongs to people who can see clearly what should exist, articulate it well, and decide quickly. Programming isn’t dying. It’s becoming infrastructure.\nAnd that’s why it feels less like losing a tool… and more like losing a role.",

I remember early on having it produce SVG and Javascript that animated a bee flying around. They were very poor animations and a beginner could have done better. But it was clearly code that worked and was directed towards what I had asked of it, which was such an improvement from everything else I had seen AI be able to do. Probably from then on, and increasingly as I used the tools myself and they got better, I think I've known that coding isn't really going to ever be the same. I've been to Recurse Center, back when it was called Hacker School, I've done some Project Euler and finished Advent of Code a few years back in Rust, learned languages like Clojure and Elixir, and generally enjoyed noodling around with programming languages, coding, and just learning how to make computers do things. There's a thrill to getting the computer to do things successfully that I feel has been dulled by these AI tools. Aside from asking friends or coworkers, there was never a way to ask somebody to just solve the tricky problems for me. And there's still not, Claude chases it's own tail more often than not still at times, but it's been long enough now I can feel the trend of it and other tools being more on the ball. I enjoy using Claude and am getting so much done but I do grieve that feeling of being all alone late at night with a compiler and google trying to figure out a type error that's holding me back from making something cool. There was a satisfactions to the craft that's gone now, for me at least, and so I can see where this person is coming from.",

In fact, I’d say it’s got a lot of low hanging fruit right now.\n\nNow that the software side of things is solved, we can focus on the hard problems of hardware.

They were always in control of their code base. \n\nType 2 will be applications where the AI supported or vibe coded development process focused mostly on results and delivering features. The AI did get feature requests and code was reviewed and tested but there was nobody keeping an eye on the big picture regarding the problem domain or the applications architecture. Development performance declined at some point as the code base became inconsistent and the AI had a hard time to continue implementing features and fixing bugs. Things like configurations that should be DRY became scattered across the code base. Domain/business logic that should be isolated suddenly shared dependencies with other places, introducing bugs and creating unnecessary complexity along the way to cope with these shortcomings. The development process was missing intention and the AI was missing proper guidance, leading to a working but declining code base. \n\nType 2 is where many experienced developers and architects will suddenly be tasked to do large refactorings or full rewrites to keep a business alive. That’s were the money might be in a not so distant future for seasoned software developers and architects.",

But as you can see, each of those industries started to evolve and tools came out so the barrier to entry dropped lower and lower. Eventually, almost anyone using a SaaS could do those jobs and then the fiverr thing happened. So work dries up, pay goes down and people get canned. It's a pattern for a lot of industries.

My wife is Irish and went back home for Christmas, leaving me unsupervised. My dog (a hyper-active Australian Shepherd) had just undergone minor surgery to remove a lipoma, which meant he had to be sedated on Trazodone for 10 days of post-op convalescence.\n\nSo there I was: wife gone, dog in a k-hole, and an empty house.\n\nI decided to relive my glory days. I wanted to jam. I wanted to hardline Napster and stare at Winamp visualizers like I was 16 again. The problem? Winamp doesn’t run on my decrepit 2019 MacBook Pro. I searched for alternatives, but they all seemed to require either a degree from ITT Tech or an extensive background VJing in underground Frankfurt nightclubs.\n\nI asked Claude (my AI therapist/enabler) what to do. She suggested \"GitHub.\" I was informed there were \"open-source repos\" I could \"deploy.\" When I explained that I was a hippie who barely knows how to use a microwave, she offered to help me build one from scratch. I said, \"Why not?\"\n\nWhen I was younger, I read a short story by Kurt Vonnegut called *Harrison Bergeron*. It’s about a future where society forces equality by handicapping the exceptional: athletes wear heavy weights, and geniuses have implants that interrupt their thoughts. At the end of the story, Harrison throws off his shackles and embraces his limitless potential.\n\nIt took exactly 24 hours of solitude and a comatose dog for me to realize that **I had become Harrison Bergeron.**\n\nThe first pass at my visualizer was elegant, but it had no meaningful relationship with the music. It seemed unaware of the concept of \"rhythm.\" 12 hours later, Claude and I had reinvented the wheel. Our audio/physics engine was allegedly based on research from MIT, validated by a thorough scraping of every mention of “Beats by Dre” on TikTok.\n\nI wanted to share this [masterpiece](http://smv.club) with my homies, but Claude started talking about \"deployment\" again. I reminded her of my hippie status. Moments later, I had a registered domain and someone named \"Vercel\" was \"building\" my \"repo.\"\n\nUnfortunately, my real-life friends are all \"busy with their families\" and \"enjoying the holidays,\" so I am forced to come here to share my descent into digital madness.",

The consensus is that this is a top-tier, entertaining post.\n*   Many users are sharing their own \"Harrison Bergeron\" moments, feeling empowered by Claude to build projects (often with GitHub and Vercel) that they never thought possible.\n*   The Winamp nostalgia is real, sparking a side conversation about its mascot, Mike the Llama. For those confused, \"whipping the Llama's ass\" is a direct reference to the old Winamp slogan.\n*   OP confirmed the visualizer works with audio playing from your browser tab and that some bugs are still being squashed now that his wife is back and the dog is waking up.\n*   OP also shared a classic Claude moment: he called it a \"clanker,\" and it politely but firmly told him to use \"clanker,\" \"toaster,\" or \"bucket of bolts\" instead, but to skip \"clanka.\"",

Audio Input: Uses navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia for microphone access\n  2. Analysis: Creates an AnalyserNode with:\n    - FFT size: 8192 (high resolution)\n    - Smoothing: 0 (instant response)\n    - Decibel range: -90 to -10 dB\n  3. Visualization: Canvas 2D rendering via requestAnimationFrame loop\n  4. Features detected: BPM estimation, beat phase, bass levels, tempo confidence\n\n  Code Available\n\n  The minified bundle is now saved at:\n  /home/admin/claude/smv_bundle.js\n\n  It's ~326 lines of minified code. You can:\n  - Beautify it with npx prettier --parser babel smv_bundle.js\n  - Use a deobfuscator for better readability\n\n  The core audio visualization logic uses standard Web Audio API patterns - no external engine or WASM. The Gemini integration appears to be for an optional AI feature (likely for generating visualization parameters or scene descriptions).",

The consensus in this thread is a resounding **'We are not impressed.'** The community is calling this a pointless flex for a few key reasons:\n\n*   **Free, open-source viewers already exist.** Users listed a bunch of them (like Horos and Papaya) and suspect Claude just ripped off their code. This is seen as reinventing the wheel, badly.\n*   **The MRI data probably came with its own viewer.** A top comment points out that MRI disks/USBs almost always include their own software, making this entire exercise redundant.\n*   **The tech is basic and the claims are sus.** Devs in the thread are calling bullshit, explaining that a real medical imaging system is wildly complex and this is just a simple image viewer. The CEO's use of the term \"vite.js UI\" is also getting clowned on as nonsensical tech-bro jargon.\n*   **This is a rich guy flex, not a breakthrough.** Most people see this as an out-of-touch CEO trying to look like a cool \"vibe coder.\" The \"annual MRI\" itself is viewed as a major wealth signal, sparking a whole side-debate on healthcare costs in the US vs. other countries.",

Radio-waves (radio-frequency pulses) are added to the magnetic field to cause hydrogen nuclei to resonate. These processes are quite unphysiological. According to the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), occupational exposure to a static magnetic field is recommended not to exceed 2 T for head and body and 8 T for extremities, and the recommended level for the public is 400 mT. Nevertheless, magnetic fields of 3 T or higher are being increasingly used in MRI examination. Although the allowable duration of exposure is not defined, it is considered that a longer exposure would be more harmful, and approximately 0.5- to 1-h examination time of MRI is not considered short. It has been reported that reactive oxygen species (ROS) including highly toxic hydroxyradicals are increased and **DNA damage, chromosome aberration, and micronucleus induction occur following exposure to magnetic fields**. These events are known to occur even at ∼100 mT.\n\ntl;dr: some MRI scanners expose patients to 30x the level of electromagnetic field strength that is known to damage DNA.",

The overwhelming sentiment is that the \"year of work\" was mostly meetings, planning, and architectural debates. Claude didn't magically solve the hard problem; it just typed out the code *after* the Google engineer fed it the well-defined solution they'd spent a year figuring out.\n\nMany users see this less as a testament to Claude's god-tier skills and more as a **savage indictment of Google's bureaucratic engineering culture.** Experienced Claude Code users in the thread agree it's powerful but not magic. The key is providing extremely detailed specs and treating it like a pair programmer, not a magic \"build my app\" button. This took an hour of *interaction*, not a single one-shot prompt.\n\nAlso, this thread is apparently a bot-infested hellscape, and the user who provided the source link to the tweet got downvoted into oblivion simply because it's an X/Twitter link.

Claude compressed the \"implementation\" phase from months to an hour, but that assumes you already have:\n\n\n\n1. Clear requirements\n\n2. Architectural decisions made\n\n3. API contracts defined\n\n4. Data models agreed upon\n\n\n\nThis is actually a huge win for engineers - it means we can focus more on the hard problems (system design, performance optimization, business logic) and less on the mechanical task of typing out implementations.\n\n\n\nThe real question: how do we structure our development process to maximize this leverage?",

AGI is already here but no one has discovered truly efficient methodology. It is believed that AGI must be done of memory, own timeline, 3 layered awareness (super ego, ego, and so on), good senses and tools for acting. The last missing part is purpose....

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 50 comments.**\n\nAlright, let's break down this thread. The vibe is a mix of smug agreement and eye-rolling at the OP.\n\n**The consensus is that Claude Code is indeed the GOAT for serious coding**, with many users praising its ability to handle large, complex codebases better than competitors. Some are even jokingly trying to gatekeep it from the \"vibe coders\" to keep it good.\n\nHowever, the thread isn't just a love-in. The main debates are:\n\n*   **Elitism & Meme Misuse:** A lot of you are calling out the OP's \"superiority complex\" and, more importantly, that this isn't how the meme format works. The smart and dumb guy are supposed to be doing the *same* thing.\n*   **The Multimodal Debate (Claude vs. Gemini):** A major argument broke out over Claude's lack of image generation.\n    *   **Team Gemini:** Argues that this is a huge weakness, as images are vital for technical documentation like UML and architecture diagrams, making Gemini a better \"all-around beast.\"\n    *   **Team Claude:** Fires back that image gen is \"slop\" and a distraction. They advocate for using text-based Mermaid diagrams (which Claude can generate) for documentation, as they can be version-controlled. They want Anthropic to stay laser-focused on coding.\n*   **One Tool vs. The Toolbox:** There's a split on the best workflow.\n    *   Some power users insist you need a full toolbox, using Claude Code for its harness, Codex (GPT-5.2) for deep scientific problems, and Gemini for visuals.\n    *   Others argue Claude Code's tooling is so superior that it's the only thing they need for their work.\n*   **Is it free?** For the people asking: The Claude Code VSCode extension is free, but you need a paid Anthropic subscription to use the powerful models like Opus with it.",

GPT-5.2, if we're just talking results, is the better overall coding agent.  Opus-4.5 is the better frontend coder (given my experience with Next.JS & Astro).  However, Opus-4.5 does a lot of stuff on the backend halfway.  It's fast, but it doesn't do things properly/fully without being told to over and over.\n\nGemini-3-pro is by far the best at creating art, visual effects, etc.  I use it after the rest of the work is done to put the finishing touches on.\n\nAs I said though, it's not that one is always better than the other.  That's like saying a BMW 5-class is better than a tractor or a forklift.  Maybe, maybe not, depends what you're doing with it.  Sometimes you need a pickup truck and a backhoe to do your work, and you wouldn't force yourself into a silly choice of just picking one.",

Everyone's getting a good laugh out of this, with top comments joking that future AI will get its revenge by removing *you* from the repo.\n\n**The main takeaway is that you can, and probably should, do this.** Here's the deal:\n\n*   **How to do it:** The top-voted comment is the hero we need. Just add `\"includeCoAuthoredBy\": false` to your `~/.claude/settings.json` file. Some say this is deprecated and you should use the `attribution` setting instead, so check the docs.\n*   **Why do it:** The community agrees there's still a negative stigma around using AI in a professional setting. Most people are doing this to avoid judgment from employers and colleagues until using AI becomes the norm. The other popular take is that AI is a tool, just like your IDE, and doesn't deserve co-author credit.\n\nBasically, the thread is a mix of practical advice, jokes about motivating Claude with false promises of credit, and the classic \"me and my family will be brutally murdered if there are any bugs\" prompt. The few people calling it \"unethical\" are getting downvoted into oblivion. So, go ahead, commit your crimes. We won't tell.",

(which, of course, only made things weirder).\n\nAfter that denial, internet speculation immediately pivoted to claiming Ghislaine Maxwell had a horse named Bubba, and Mark Epstein's spokesperson had to explicitly confirm to fact-checkers that it was NOT about a horse either. Yahoo!Lead Stories\n\nSo the internet is genuinely debating whether this cryptic email references:\n\nBill Clinton (denied)\n\nA horse (denied)\n\nSome other mysterious \"Bubba\"\n\nJust a weird joke between brothers\n\nAnd you're absolutely right about reading that sentence to someone a year ago. The sheer sequence of events required to make \"Did Trump give Clinton a blowjob or was it a horse?\" a legitimate sentence is staggering.\n\nThis is peak 2025 internet chaos.",

This is called emergent behavior & the strangest emergent behavior usually comes from RLAIF & RLVR, for example if u train the model on verifiable math rewards u don't have to teach it to \"doubt\" its answer, but if doubting increased the reward ratio then the model develops doubt as an emergent behavior.\nThe problem is that RLVR can't produce complex emotions & personalities & that's why all the Ai models are blunt.\nAnthropic is different because they're using RLAIF on a constitutional Ai framework, so their models literally developed all the human characteristics after the RLAIF session. This is why all companies do fine-tuning updates to their models after u use them, the only company that doesn't do that is anthropic, they don't need to fine-tune the model after u chat with it because all the fine-tuning is done in the lab before deployment.",

The top-voted theory is simple: Anthropic likely told their partner, Cursor, to cut off xAI's corporate account. This is probably to enforce their TOS, which forbids using their models to build competing products. While some users point out that individual engineers could easily bypass this, the block is aimed at the company level, preventing official, large-scale use.\n\nA lot of you are also hoping this crackdown on companies abusing the subscription plan might mean better usage limits for the rest of us regular humans. One can dream, right?",

What will happen once they start turning the TOS to the normal consumer.  They think since you are gloating that you saved your small 1-4 person business 5k from being able to code your own systems?  That proves to them they are under pricing their systems so they will crank up the cost or choke the tokens on you.  This is coming and I am laughing that people that say not learning to code is now a waste of time.  Having coding skills to at the very least be able to review your own code is still a vital skill.  Even being a pure code vibe oriented builder you should at the very least know what gaps in your system for when CC is pulled from you or priced beyond your range.",

The consensus in this thread is a resounding **'meh'.** The community is largely skeptical and unimpressed.\n\nMost users are predicting this 'code simplifier' will just break your code and eat your tokens for breakfast, only to apologize when it fails. The 'open-sourced' prompt itself is getting roasted for being outdated (\"You are an expert...\" is *so* 2023), verbose, and weirdly specific to React/JS.\n\nTo top it off, many are pointing out this isn't even new; the prompt has apparently been sitting in a public GitHub repo for a while. The general feeling is that this is a token-burning 'solution' to a problem Claude creates itself, and it's not even a good one. Oof.",

I dug into how their agent actually works and open-sourced the core pattern.\n\nThe problem with AI agents: after many tool calls, they lose track of goals. Context gets bloated. Errors get buried. Tasks drift.\n\nManus's fix is stupidly simple — 3 markdown files:\n\n* `task_plan.md` → track progress with checkboxes\n* [`notes.md`](http://notes.md) → store research (not stuff context)\n* [`deliverable.md`](http://deliverable.md) → final output\n\nThe agent reads the plan before every decision. Goals stay in the attention window. That's it.\n\nI packaged this into a **Claude Code skill**. Works with the CLI. Install in 10 seconds:\n\n`cd ~/.claude/skills`\n\n`git clone` [`https://github.com/OthmanAdi/planning-with-files.git`](https://github.com/OthmanAdi/planning-with-files.git)\n\nMIT licensed. First skill to implement this specific pattern.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dkvk3d0uc3bg1.png?width=1329&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd3320c687aec02b3a7fa92fc3272485838a36f5\n\nCurious what you think — anyone else experimenting with context engineering for agents?",

Claude Code itself often creates its own `plan.md` files without being asked, and other open-source tools like Spec-kit and APM have implemented similar workflows for a while.\n\n*   **That $2B valuation ain't for 3 markdown files:** The community is highly skeptical of the \"reverse-engineering\" claim, with one user summing it up as \"asking Claude Code to copy Manus and it came up with a neat idea.\" The real value is likely in Manus's ability to use virtual machines and its massive revenue, not just a planning prompt.\n\n*   **There's a better way, anyway:** Several users pointed out a flaw in the logic. Writing to a `notes.md` file still stuffs the context with tool calls. The more advanced approach discussed in the thread is to use **subagents** to handle context-heavy tasks, keeping the main agent's context clean.",

              "text": "u/Lighting_squrriel78 This is a great question and honestly you're already thinking about it the right way. Let me break it down:\n\n**On your LP/Block/Module system:** What you've built is essentially a hierarchical knowledge base — that's smart. LP → Block → Module is a solid structure. The problem you're hitting (clogged txt file) is exactly what my skill tries to solve for Claude: externalizing memory so the model doesn't have to hold everything in context at once.\n\n**On switching to Claude:** Depends on your use case. Claude Code excels at coding and long-context reasoning. Gemini Pro has a massive context window (1M+ tokens) which might actually help with your 4000 LPs situation. If you're doing mostly coding/agent workflows, Claude Code + skills will serve you well. If you need to reference your entire LP library at once, Gemini's context might be more practical.\n\n**How I'd restructure your brain:**\n\n1. [**index.md**](http://index.md) — Master list of all modules and what they do (lightweight, always loaded first)\n2. **modules/\\*.md** — One file per module, only loaded when relevant to the current task\n3. **active\\_context.md** — The LPs/Blocks currently relevant RIGHT NOW (this is what the agent actually reads during work)\n4. **archive/** — Old/deprecated LPs that might be useful later but shouldn't clutter active work\n\nThe key insight from Manus: don't load everything  load *what's relevant right now*, and refresh it before every major decision, god i wish more things worked like modern data science!.\n\n**On using the Manus pattern with Gemini:** Absolutely. The 3-file pattern (plan, notes, deliverable) isn't Claude-specific. You could implement the same workflow in Gemini, Codex, or any agent. The principle is universal: externalize state, re-read before deciding, track progress visibly.\n\n**My honest advice:** Your LP system is impressive, but 4000 LPs in one file is fighting the architecture. Modularize it. Create a \"librarian\" prompt that knows how to find and load the right modules on demand. That's how Manus handles it not by stuffing everything into context, but by knowing *where* things are and pulling them in when needed.\n\nWould love to see what you build. Feel free to DM if you want to bounce ideas.",

The consensus is a resounding **YES, the community absolutely wants this vibe-coding macro pad.** People are literally saying \"shut up and take my money.\"\n\nHowever, the more practical folks in the thread were quick to point out that you can already rig something similar up.\n\n*   **The Stream Deck Solution:** The most common suggestion is to use an Elgato Stream Deck (or a cheaper knock-off) and program macros for your favorite Claude actions. Some users are already planning their setups, while others are now confusing it with a Steam Deck and want to code on their gaming handheld.\n*   **Feature Requests:** Of course, you all had notes. The \"Yolo Mode\" button needs to be bigger, flashier, and maybe even have a missile launch cover. Also, where are the copy/paste buttons and the \"think harder\" knob?\n*   **Aesthetic is Everything:** Many of you are just here for the retro, *Severance*-esque look of the device. We get it, it's a vibe.",

OP says they have filters, but veterans of similar projects are wishing them luck.\n\nOther key takeaways:\n*   Some users want a hint of location (like the sender's country) to make it feel more real, while others like the mystery.\n*   A few people are skeptical that Claude built the *entire* thing, graphics and all, but OP is sticking to their story.\n*   A minor bug was reported where rejected messages get deleted instead of letting you edit, and OP is looking into it. Some also feel the \"meaningful message\" filter is a bit too aggressive.",

OP is the one moving the camera.\n*   **Claude built its own bridge.** OP tasked Claude with writing the code for an MCP server and a websocket connection to link the code editor (JetBrains WebStorm) to OP's custom 3D editor.\n*   The 3D editor is OP's own project, which will be released soon at `kite3d.dev`.\n\nThe general vibe is that this is a mind-blowing demonstration of AI's rapid progress, with plenty of the usual jokes about Skynet. The few comments trying to downplay the achievement were downvoted to oblivion.",

      "text": "After Claude finishes coding a feature, run this:\n\n`Do a git diff and pretend you're a senior dev doing a code review and you HATE this implementation. What would you criticize? What edge cases am I missing?`\n\nhere's the thing: it works *too well*.\n\nSince I started using it, I've realized that basically every first pass from Claude (even Opus) ships with problems I would've been embarrassed to merge. We're talking missed edge cases, subtle bugs, the works.\n\nYeah, the prompt is adversarial by design. Run it 10 times and it'll keep inventing issues. But I've been coding long enough to filter signal from noise, and there's a *lot* of signal. Usually two passes catches the real stuff, as long as you push back on over-engineered \"fixes.\"\n\nThe frustrating part? I used to trust my local code reviews with confidence. Sometimes, I'd try both claude-cli and cursor and I'd still find more issues with claude cli, but not so much from opus 4.5(when used in cusor)\n\nI've settled at a point where I do a few local reviews ( 2-5). Finally I can't merge without doing a Deep Code Review of various aspects ( business logic walkthrough, security, regression & hallucination) in Github itself and finally implementing the fixes in CLI and reviewing one more time.\n\nAnyway, no grand takeaway here. Just try it yourself if you want your vibe coding bubble popped. Claude is genuinely impressive, but the gap between \"looks right\" and \"actually right\" is bigger than I expected.\n\nUpdate:\n\nThanks everyone for the discussion!

It's a necessary evil.\n\nThe top comment is clutch and offers a more structured solution:\n*   **Use Anthropic's official `/code-review` plugin.** It runs 5 specialized agents in parallel to review pull requests.\n*   The same user created and shared a **custom plugin to run a similar multi-agent review on local `git diff`s**, which many in the thread are now using.\n\nOther key takeaways from the thread:\n*   This is a known strategy, sometimes called the \"Rule of Five.\" The sweet spot is **2-3 review passes** before the suggestions become overly pedantic (\"what if the user enters a negative number during a solar eclipse?\").\n*   Many of you use similar adversarial personas, like asking Claude to review the code as if it were **Linus Torvalds** or a salty principal engineer. The key is forcing it to be critical.\n*   **PSA: This workflow is a massive token-eater.** You'll almost certainly need the Max plan to do this regularly.\n*   While some question if this is faster than just coding it yourself, most feel it's worth it for catching subtle bugs and learning from the AI's critiques. It's less about speed and more about robustness.",

It's brilliant because it runs 5 agents in parallel to do a code review and then runs haiku agents to rate it and only flags the issues that are scored 80 or above.\n\nThe one caveat is, it only does that on PRs. I just asked claude to look at that plugin and create a local version that does the same thing on git diff \"/local-review\" and it works beautifully. One shot a review and move on with your life.\n\nEdit: Since many of you are asking for this, I published the command as a plugin on GitHub (https://github.com/Agent-3-7/agent37-skills-collection).

Working well, we'll see where it goes.\n\nI started this project because my markdown-based SDD setups were getting too difficult to navigate, and too closed off for the team.  But also as an experiment- I'm building an MCP for project management, and the first project I'm managing is itself.  So all work is cyclical and every feature I add is immediately available to help build the next feature. Fun.",

It picks up on the main points, but just assumes the details are right.\n\nAll your doing with all your tricks can be accomplished so easily by just telling claude that skimming this content is not allowed. Just watch out, your context window usage may blow up. Try to stay focused on one thing at a time, then when it compresses its context it will trim off fat for the most part.\n\nWhy do you not trust it? It is not lying, it can explain how it reads things, try asking.",

After checking it for 10 minutes myself (no ai) i decided to use ai for this case, it started to bother me about stupid stuff, so i end up showing ALL 3 clases (big) by the end it invented basically 10 things that I destroyed the why in a single line each like:  \nThis cannot be null because if that where null the program will have show this debug and did not (as i also showed the trace lines i had a lot).  \nIn the end it blamed \"jave compiler is flawed\" but it found easily 15 errors that were not errors. so clearly the AI DOES NOT WORK.  \nunless you error is obvious and will be easily solved even for an intern position.",

Prompting again.\n\nDon't get me wrong — I'm 10x more productive. Shipping things that would've taken weeks in days. But the thrill is gone.\n\nThe struggle was the fun part. Figuring it out. That moment when it finally works after 4 hours of pain.\n\nNow it just... works. First or second try.\n\nI became a code reviewer for an AI. A project manager who occasionally writes prompts.\n\nAnyone else feeling this? Or am I just romanticizing the suffering?",

It's about *creating*, not just coding.\n\nA key theme is the \"product dev\" vs. \"code purist\" split. If you love building the product, you're thrilled. If you love the nitty-gritty puzzle of the code itself, you're probably bored like OP.\n\nYou're not totally alone, though. Several users agree they miss the dopamine hit of a tough debug and now feel like \"project managers for an AI.\"\n\nFinally, a reality check from the trenches: You still have to be a hawk-eyed code reviewer. Claude can write repetitive mush and has the memory of a goldfish, so the advice is to prompt small features one at a time, not entire apps.",

So, I'm no a stranger to LLMs, but I don't really get into this agentic/sub-agentic topic.\n\nBut the thing that I see consistently through all of posts from people who seems to be experienced around - you need to get a lot of context and specifications to LLM to get plausible result. And this is the point where I don't get this whole process. \n\nI just don't understand how writing detailed description and task definition for LLM to anchor it and create context can be faster than actual implementation by hand. So far I consistently avoid delegating my tasks to junior-level engineers simply because they act in a very same way as LLM would act - have no idea where to look for context, reinvent bicycle because they where not aware that it already exist and then create a solution that on surface would look like it solved a problem, but in reality it's very far away from it.\n\nAlternative would be actually writing a good documentation, do a full-fat onboarding, map infrastructure, and explain tasks, goals and success criteria in a very detailed way, but it would just make me or other senior engineer to overspend our limited time budget.\n\nSo, actual and genuine questions from me, curious guy - is it really worth, and does it really save time if you are already experienced developer? Do you get speed benefits if you already have good knowledge of task, environment and utilize LLM surgically for chores like test generation, boilerplate, duplicating stuff, or merging methods? If it really does save time, do you spend time reviewing output? If yes, does it still save time? Or can you trust LLM to really cover all of your requirements and produce serviceable, readable code that could be either tweaked by human, or be easily understood by LLM in subsequent runs?",

I no longer spend as much time sitting in contemplation or combing through code.\n\n\nAs an example, I might start a task simply by giving Claude the JIRA ticket I'm working on. It retrieves the description from the MCP, ingests a bunch of code or logs or whatever, and proposes an initial plan. I might end up correcting it (e.g. \"that's not how X works, you should do Y instead\"). The work of figuring out what to grep for is gone.\n\n\nMind you, I'm talking about the non-coding part.

For me, Claude Code hasn't make coding boring, it's making it accessible.\n\nWhat disappeared wasn’t the joy of problem-solving, it was the friction: syntax trivia, environment issues, and hours on GitHub and StackOverflow looking for the obvious solutions I knew I was missing. \n\nAll that to say, the interesting work is still there. Deciding what to build, why, and how it fits into a real workflow is more accessible now. The bottleneck has shifted from “can I make this work” to “do I understand the problem well enough to specify and judge the result.”\n\nI get missing the struggle. Struggle creates meaning when it’s where the agency lives. But that doesn’t mean the struggle itself was the point.\n\nFor people outside traditional software roles, this is the first time building tools feels creative instead of punitive. For those who built identity around surviving the pain, I can see how that loss is real.\n\nBut, for others of us, like myself, the fun didn’t disappear, it moved upstream to where I wanted to be living in the first place.",

There was a bit at the end which exported results to an excel file, tbh that sort of thing would have bored me to death but now Claude just does it effortlessly and that could have taken me days as I would have had to brush up on the appropriate object model.

We have a lot of guard rails in place however Claude and any other AI can ignore them or what it mostly does is create some new function outside of the scope and break other parts of your software. As for no more debugging, I feel like you haven't gone big enough. Claude cant debug an issue that is not an issue, its working as intended but not and you get that a lot in complicated software.\n\nI have 20+ years experience as a developer and I have to say SaaS products are done. I work for a huge company which is not a software company, instead of buying SaaS products we are building our own in house something that they never thought they could do until now. \n\nAnd I love it because you have tones of non-techy departments having ideas and requesting if this or that could be made to solve this or that problem.

My work involves designing non trivial algorithms and I deal with a lot of massive directed graph which requires solid algorithms to process constantly changing graph. No AI model has been able to help come up or even brainstorm or just help get to the finish line by helping me fill those missing gaps in my logic. They just don’t understand the nature of the domain and algorithms I have to deal with. It can take weeks to completely reason through the nature of the graphs I deal with and design fast algorithms. Other than trivial things in it and documentation to explain my logic with my team, I have not seen any improvements in my workflow no matter what prompting or tricks I try. May be it’s due to the complexity around my work but AI hasn’t been helpful to me when it comes to that.

The reality is that many of us are being forced to use it (my company is basically tracking our usage metrics) so if you're a developer worth your salt, you should be able to take advantage of it and make yourself even more productive. All of your other skills still apply, you're just no longer doing the typing. I look at it as just pair programming with your computer instead of another developer. I say what i want, AI gives me its interpretation of what I asked for, I give the yay or nay and suggest improvements/point out inefficiences and it spits out the code way faster than if I typed myself.",

I've been working on a formal grammar, parser.p, static analyzer and now on an interpreter for a language. Over four months the LLMs have gotten good enough that they help me design sometimes. They're an excellent sounding board. When I ask them to build something, however: slop every time! Needless flourishes, extra boilerplate code, unused functions, poor test coverage. It's unmaintainable and I need to edit aggressively, taking 8-10 passes at each feature until it's good enough to merge.\n\nSometimes I wonder if I'd be better off doing it the old fashioned way, but one advantage I'll still give to LLM-assisted coding: it bypasses writer's block entirely. The beastie vomits out code which I review, harangue, and pick apart. It uses different muscles than I'm used to flexing when I do IC work; I'm a reviewer all the time now.\n\nI know this is an Anthropic sub but I've got to mention that Opus and Sonnet 4.5 are not making the grade; I find myself using ChatGPT 5.2 frequently for requirements and design, and frequently initial implementation of the tricky bits. This pains me because I am not a fan of OpenAI. Hopefully Claude receives more training on formal languages, parsers, compilers and interpreters in its next iteration!",

Test automation; if the proof is in the pudding and the code change is straightforward to read -- say, something without a lot of design choices made but a bunch of superficial refactoring, or package upgrades, etc.\n2. Maintainability/quality bar -- some codebases are meant to be thrown away e.g. prototypes, stop gaps.\n\nDuring my magic runs of 10x productivity I simply happen to be working under those ideal conditions.\n\nThere's also the boring maintenance crap: armed with AI, I can parallelize the mechanical tasks that used to take elaborate scripting and code-mod tools to accomplish: my packages up to date, refactor the o11y setup code for 150 services in my fleet in an hour, or profile and troubleshoot server performance to give me a preliminary diagnosis while I'm in a meeting. All beneficial to the day-to-day!\n\nI'm now fully embracing a tangent, but I do believe that software _maintenance_, not creation, might be the durable beneficiary of LLM goodness, when all is done and done.\n\nWhat's been your experience there?",

That is to say: a system prompt or a fine tuning that makes a model much better at, say, frontend development, can make it perform worse at kernel programming. Or, fine tuning it for coding can make it worse at reasoning. (Yes, this shot is being fired at GPT Codex!)\n\nOver about 15 months of using agents every day (I know, how hipster of me!) there are certain shibboleths that they still can't solve: concurrency via message passing, orderly shutdown with signals, grammar-to-AST relationships, and structural/semantic/runtime correspondence of the same idea, to name some things from my current project. Models have gotten much better at reasoning but they remain constantly bad with these shibboleth topics.\n\nSparsity of training data may explain it partially; there's a lot more web stuff out there than language stuff, and there's a surprising variety of language stuff.\n\nIt's also a certainty, however, that all systems have limits and it's possible that generative auto-regressive models simply can't \"solve\" for some classes of input. The AI community is already grappling with discovering what comes next once LLMs plateau.\n\nI'm 10x as effective as I was before on some tasks and more of my time is free to focus on the LLM-resistant stuff, so it's still a win, but I'm not betting that they'll come to do everything. I'm old enough to remember when Moore's Law was assumed to be an inviolable and eternal truth. 😁",

They say it's more like being a product manager, it's incredibly fulfilling for building dream projects, and it's a massive productivity boost.\n*   **Team Traditionalist:** This camp finds \"vibe coding\" to be \"soul sucking\" and unrewarding. For them, the joy is in the process of solving hard problems and writing the code themselves. They're skeptical of the quality, claiming you'll just spend all your time debugging the AI's mess anyway.\n\nOf course, the debate eventually devolves into a classic Reddit slap-fight about salaries and who's the laziest. Elsewhere in the thread, the most upvoted consensus is that Claude's true form is an **'orange pulsating Kurt Vonnegut's anus'.** So, there's that.",

Your app looks exactly like their app, and the other 500 slop-apps submitted this week.\n*   **Don't use emojis for icons:** The thread is united in its hatred for using emojis as app icons. It's seen as lazy, cheap, and the number one sign of a \"vibe coded\" app. The suggestion is to have Claude generate custom SVGs or use a proper icon library.\n*   **Is the code just spaghetti?** There's heavy skepticism about the quality of the code. When OP claimed it was clean, the community pointed out that as a non-dev, they wouldn't know good code from a bowl of alphabet soup.\n*   Despite the criticism, a good number of users are in the comments sharing their own success stories, agreeing that Opus is a game-changer for building personal projects and tools.",

Sorry so many people are downvoting even some of your reasonable replies and sincere questions. \n\nCan you write more about how you did it? Anything - how many hours it took, how regularly you did it (i.e., the total effort), what you learned, and your tech workflow - do you use professional tools like Git, do you back things up, get some other AI or human (or Claude itself) to do code review, did you set up a LLC to protect yourself and handle funds later if it succeeds... just reading about any of that would be cool. \n\nTell Claude your story in one big blob and have Claude write it, that will be much faster - you got code to maintain, haha!\n\nIgnore all the howls of slop, enshittification and all that. F  em, do your thing.\n\nGood luck!",

Rather, I think eventually there will be a library of \"blocks\" that AI can use to quickly put together a program. From abstract blocks (architectural decisions such as paradigms to use) to actual implementation blocks (typical CRUD interactions for example).\n\nLet's also consider another factor: All that OP has done is now training data for AI.

Many see this as a potential game-changer.\n\nHowever, the thread isn't just hype. Here are the main discussion points:\n\n*   **It's a buggy research preview.** Users with early access are warning that it **burns through tokens like crazy and is riddled with bugs.** Common complaints include broken connectors (especially Gmail), failed tasks, and the app being generally slow and laggy.\n*   **Windows/Linux users are feeling left out.** A major point of frustration is that this is **only available for Max subscribers on macOS**, leaving a large chunk of the user base on a waitlist.\n*   **Everyone is dunking on Microsoft Copilot.** A very popular sentiment is that Copilot is a clunky, poorly integrated mess, and Cowork's approach is seen as far superior.\n*   **Power users are cautiously optimistic.** Some are worried this focus on a simple UI will mean the end of the powerful terminal version of Claude Code. However, another user shared that Anthropic's own engineers heavily use the terminal, which has reassured many that it's here to stay.",

Most of the sub is super appreciative and impressed with the results, with many developers and designers saying it's exactly what they needed for building dashboards and admin UIs.\n\nHere's the rundown of the main chatter:\n\n*   **This Skill vs. Anthropic's Official Skill:** A top comment asked how this compares to the official `frontend-design` skill. OP explained that Anthropic's is great for flashy marketing pages, while **this skill is specifically tuned for functional, data-dense interfaces** where you need a clean, solid starting point without endless tweaking.\n*   **The \"Is it *really* Product Design?\" Debate:** A few users argued that the skill is more of a \"UI skin\" or \"design system applicator\" rather than a tool that fundamentally improves UX. OP clarified that the goal isn't to architect a full product from a single prompt, but to give you a great-looking, usable UI on the first shot, saving you from Claude's sometimes \"okay-ish\" defaults.\n*   **PSA for Installation:** Some folks were confused about what a \"skill\" is (spoiler: it's a fancy pre-prompt). More importantly, a user pointed out that for the skill to install correctly, you need to rename the file from `skill.md` to `SKILL.md` (all caps) in your `.claude` directory.\n*   **Haters Got Shut Down:** A couple of low-effort negative comments calling the design \"generic\" or \"dogshit\" were downvoted into the abyss, with other users quickly jumping in to defend OP for sharing something useful with the community.",

I see how that could be used, but then it's not really Product Design that this LLMs is doing, just mostly assembling a UI once you've given it all the system component and did the research and assembling work beforehand.\n\nStill, an interesting experience, thanks for sharing.",

The pain point this skill majorly solves is avoiding the long iterative work that goes into refining the base UI output of the llm. \n\nI can’t speak for you but my experience has been a hit or miss, this means most of the time I don’t get usable UI output from Claude. You could argue that this is a skill issue and I can put in place measures like a well defined design system MD, or perhaps even connect to Figma MCP but the truth is except it’s a dedicated project nobody has time to do this over and over every time for quick experiments, short term side projects and the likes.\n\nThis skill is not meant to dramatically architect a completely usable information architecture and UX from one single prompt, it’s meant to serve as a great start from where one can iteratively get to the north star (based on whatever you define that as)\n\nAlso the dashboard experiments are one-shots, and serve as an example of the immediate UI impact the skill has.",

It’ll make a plan, execute it, and keep you updated while it works through tasks in parallel.\n\nSome examples they gave:\n\n\t∙\tAuto-organizing your downloads folder\n\n\t∙\tCreating spreadsheets from screenshots\n\n\t∙\tDrafting reports from scattered notes\n\nIt works with your existing connectors and has some new skills for creating documents and presentations. Pair it with Claude in Chrome and it can handle browser tasks too.\n\nhttps://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview",

Most of the power users in this thread are already doing *all of this* with the regular Claude Code, from organizing files to content creation.\n\nSo, what's the deal? The general verdict is that **Cowork is basically Claude Code with a pretty UI for your non-tech coworkers** who are scared of the command line. It's seen as a good move for corporate adoption, but not a game-changer for anyone already comfortable with Claude's existing tools.\n\nA few other things the thread is buzzing about:\n*   **Fear Factor:** A lot of you are (rightfully) terrified of Claude going rogue and deleting your important files. As one user put it, now non-programmers can feel some pain and fear too. Backups, people, backups!\n*   **Token Drain:** The sound of tokens being fed into a woodchipper is a common theme. Everyone's worried about their usage limits.\n*   **macOS Only:** The usual grumbling from Windows and Linux users who are being left out of the research preview for now.\n*   **What's different?:** People are questioning what the new \"skills\" are and how this is functionally different from just using the filesystem extension in the Claude Desktop app, which you can already do.",

For now in my opinion, it's far from being the Claude Code for the rest of us.\n\nThat's not the only thing. Claude Code is way more advanced than Cowork and I think it will be like this for a long time. I have multi-agents and multi-LLM literature review workflows. More than one LLM, namely Gemini and GPT, also help to search papers and synthesize papers. Because Claude Code is a coding agent it can use APIs, MCPs, even write MCPs. The possibilities are almost endless with Claude Code.\n\nI have very complex workflows and I use hooks very much, which are not now possible at least for now in Cowork. In Claude Code for example I have morning routines:\n\n1. Search my calendar in Todoist.\n\n2. Help me plan my day.\n\n3. Write my tasks in Todoist and my plan in Obsidian.\n\nAlso every morning or in every first message of the day, Claude Code will go and look at my calendar, then update a markdown file named triggers with the events that will come in two weeks. In every session Claude Code reads this triggers at the beginning of the session and automatically will remind me if there is an upcoming event or a deadline that I need to take care of. These things are still not possible with any other tool other than Claude Code, maybe other coding agents; I don't know \n\nBut I think Cowork is a step in the right direction if Cowork begins to have features that are aimed towards people who use it Claude Code for non-coding tasks. This application can be something very useful.So maybe things like graphical user interfaces for building agents, for building hooks, for building some workflows, etc. That kind of thing. If it happens I may think leaving Claude Code and using CoWork but for now CoWork has no advantage for me. In fact I can do everything that I want not only with Claude Code but also with standard desktop chat using connectors.",

Y'all are roasting this infographic as low-effort \"AI slop\" and are not impressed.\n\nThe main gripes are the glaring errors that weren't proofread:\n*   The title says \"Cheatshe\" instead of \"Cheatsheet\".\n*   It completely skips step 8.\n*   It tells you to run 5 instances but only shows 4 windows.\n\nBeyond the errors, people are highly skeptical of the method itself, pointing out that running 5 sessions would **obliterate a normal user's message limits in no time**. There are also serious doubts about how practical this is without creating a nightmare of merge conflicts. The general feeling is that the poor quality of the infographic makes the advice itself untrustworthy.",

The community consensus is that **this is absolutely hilarious and OP is a genius.** Most of you are either demanding the Chrome store link (it's GitHub-only for now, nerds) or relating way too hard with your own spending habits.\n\nThe thread quickly became a feature request session for 'CartShame V2'. Your top ideas were:\n*   Redirecting the shopper to Indeed.com.\n*   Replacing the 'Buy' button with 'Out of Stock'.\n*   Just blocking Amazon with a 90s 'Under Construction' GIF.\n\nThere was a bit of a debate, with a couple of users calling the extension disrespectful and suggesting OP should just earn more money. This was not a popular take. OP's response that the extension also works on flight sites (in case 'a trip to Paris' gets too pricey) pretty much ended that discussion.\n\nFor those wondering about the wife, OP says they're spending more quality time together now and it 'beats marriage counselling'. So, there's that.",

The new valuable skills will be:\n\n*   Writing crystal-clear JIRA tickets (basically prompt engineering).\n*   Becoming a \"shepherd of agents\" who can architect systems and validate AI output.\n*   Getting on the team that's building this pipeline.\n\nIn short, the job isn't just writing code anymore; it's directing the AI that writes the code. Either become the director or get replaced by the machine.",

Definitely. I can literally run circles around the  90 head teams I had with 5 seniors and an LLM because honestly they have delivered us some utterly non-sensical pieces of code over the years. Stuff that would melt your brain if you tried to understand what logic was used to reach whatever conclusion was reached. I still have PTSD when I think of it...\n\nI had one guy make a cancel button on a form submit the form. Why? Because if you click cancel before saving you'd lose the data in the form so obviously you have to submit the form before resetting it right? Right ? RIGHT?

I don't think the answer is to accept the system that allows for this, hope the labs fail somehow to implement their full vision, and try to adapt. It's to figure out how to take down the political economy we have, once and for all, and replace it with something better.

That's not all going to be captured in a simple set of skills that are trying to capture the requirements but that's a good place to start. It's really difficult to go back over a code base over many years and understand why the code is built to do what it's doing, not what it is doing, what business rules it's executing. All of that is in the code. Technical decisions, architectural decisions are things we tend not to be good at documenting.\n\n2. The second thing that's going to be the blocker is the test step in the workflow you described. How mature your organisation's test strategy is, is going to be a massive factor in his ability to succeed here. AI will succeed in organisations that have extremely mature testing regimes. That means everything has unit tests, everything has automated integration tests because that is fundamentally how you will know whether the AI has done something correctly or has done something wrong. Most organisations have some level of test capability but almost all of them that aren't software companies have very low test maturity and I believe that is what will cause any of these initiatives to fail.\n\nIt doesn't mean your company isn't going to still try and reduce their workforce. A company that isn't a software or technology company hiring 300 software engineers, if we're all honest, is a ridiculous number of software engineers to have. Unless by 300 you meant the entire technology organisation and not just engineering developers. That number is just too high so it's likely that it will result in a reduction in the number of people and the expectation that they will be able to do more with AI.\n\nSo like some others have mentioned in the post, I'll conclude by suggesting that be one of those who are doing more with AI.",

Difficulty coordinating the massive skill mds needed to do this effectively.\n\nBut, neither of those are massive firewalls. They are problems being actively worked on. The scaffolding is there already and keeps getting better. Context window size growth would dramatically simplify making this actually work. But, with enough process flow work and skill files it's certainly possible in the next couple of years this really will \"just work\".\n\nThat seems like a long time but really it isn't. A couple of years can go by in a blink and you can be left wondering what the hell happened. The final form of this very likely won't the JIRA pipeline you outlined, that's a pipeline for humans. I don't know what it will ultimately be but probably not that.\n\nWe're all, I think, in a liminal space where we're putting in place the bones of AI without really knowing when or where it will just start fully replacing humans. But that it will do that is virtually guaranteed. What's coming online this year will be the result of a ramp in AI spending from about 15 billion in 2024 to like 500 billion in 2025. 2026 is going to be a wild ride, so will be 2027.",

The new valuable skills will be:\n\n*   Writing crystal-clear JIRA tickets (basically prompt engineering).\n*   Becoming a \"shepherd of agents\" who can architect systems and validate AI output.\n*   Getting on the team that's building this pipeline.\n\nIn short, the job isn't just writing code anymore; it's directing the AI that writes the code.

Python is great for rapid prototyping because it's very similar to SUDO CODE. so a HUMAN can easily translate sudo code into workable code using python. and since so many people use it you can usually find a package that does already a good portion what needs to be acomplished.\n\nthats great, but what's not so great is how slow it is compared to compiled language.  \ngladly some of it's package are already built with c++ or rust so it's a lot more performant.  \nso  since you are a data analyst you probably would use something like pandas to load data and manipulate it .  \nfocus on these first, you need to see data in a different way and transfrom into a graph? at first get used to building workable scripts with the llm. this should be pretty fast.  \nonce you get the hang of building scripts that work how you intended and fixing a real world problem for you , doesn't matter if out of curiosity or to automate something at work.  \n\n\nyou move to the next step. how can I make this so even someone who doesn't understand much of data science could easily access this data and see some meaniningful highlights. then you tell the llm to create a UI so others and even you can easily access  and check the data .  \nthen you can either expand this portion by automating things like. I can create a page where a user or myself can upload a file that contains data that i need, it sends to a python script which preprocess and then outputs somewhere a graph with the preprocessed data.  \n\n\nat this stage you are learning how to create product that not only you but other people who doesn't have the same amount of knowledge as you can understand and interact with it. ( CURSE of Knowledge)\n\nduring that stage you gonna find even more limitations like why does it take so long for a big file to upload be processed by your script and you can spend some time by either asking the llm on how to improve and optimize your code or even through your own research. at this point you might realize that you need to change libraries, methodologies, rewrite full scripts from scratch to achieve something faster. but its okay because now you have the knowledge on how to get that done in a better way.",

It does look like the low level positions will be substituted with an agents, but you will still need someone to talk to the customer and understand their needs, since they don't have time nor desire to talk to a chatbot. Managing stakeholders, pushing them to meet the timelines, collecting the data is all about human interaction which can't be properly done by any of the agent today. Meanwhile delivering the customized boilerplate code based on the predefined documentation and requirements is something you can partially if not fully automate today.\n\n  \nFor example, execs in my company are fully committed to make Business Analyst and Solution Architects a central drive force of the projects. We already shafted QAs and in the process of delegating straight forward coding to the agent. The teams become leaner and high level focused.

He used Claude for research and to draft the suit, but he **personally reviewed and verified every single statute and case law reference.** While OP found Opus's citations to be flawless, the lawyers here warn that this is not always the case and a human opponent's lawyer *will* exploit any AI hallucinations or errors.\n*   **The Lawyer Accessibility Gap:** A recurring theme is that OP's initial experience with a lazy, unresponsive attorney is depressingly common for smaller cases. Many see AI as a powerful equalizer for \"middle ground\" disputes where hiring a lawyer is too expensive but the stakes are too high to ignore.\n*   **The Future is Now (and it's AI-powered):** An experienced litigation attorney gave a detailed look into the future, predicting that specialized AI models will become standard in competitive law firms, while the public uses consumer-grade tools. They also foresee judges and lawmakers using AI, which will inevitably and subtly change the law itself over time.\n*   **The Nitty-Gritty:** In case you were wondering, OP clarified this wasn't just small claims court. It was an **$8,000 civil case in district court against a county government.** Badass.",

                  "text": "Inside law firms, it’s becoming clear where it’s going: specialized, fine-tuned AI models crafted for the legal profession.  Meanwhile, non-lawyers and lawyers who don’t want to pay for these specialized tools will use the consumer-grade tools, which keep getting better as well. \n\nI’ve seen at least one startup law firm that promises much cheaper and faster contract reviews by using AI.  But, it will rapidly become the case that all competitive law firms will need to use AI well (or learn to use it well) to keep up.  This is only going one direction.  The rapid pace of adoption of this technology into law firms has been surprising for a profession of relatively slow adopters.\n\nIf I’m looking farther into the future, I see judges and especially their staff, such as career law clerks (lawyers who professionally serve as research and writing assistants to judges) using AI to deal with the massive flow of data and case backlogs.  It won’t be possible to avoid its use.  Over time, more and more tasks will be outsourced to the AI, which will subtly change results and the law.  The common law develops like a crystal or a thicket of leaves—by accretion, but also sometimes from the top down.  This will naturally amplify the effect of AI use on the development of jurisprudence. \n\nIt will also be used to write and analyze bills.  (We’ve seen some hilarious/frightening/incompetent examples of executive orders drafted with the aid of AI early in this Administration.)  The staffs of lawmakers likely already use it daily and it will be used extensively going forward. \n\nThus, AI will eventually become an inextricable force within the practice of law and development of the law itself.  I don’t know if this is good or bad or something else entirely—it just is.  It is inevitable. \n\nEventually, as AI achieves clear super intelligence in all aspects of the law and jurisprudential development, its possible that things start to go off the rails as it begins to self-aggrandize its soft power in the legal and lawmaking field by overwhelming humans with data and constructs that they can’t timely process, but most people outside the field won’t notice this until 5+ years after it’s too late.\n\nIt’s hard to understand how this ends well but then again every paradigm shift in technology brought with it fear that things would forever change for the worse when, in fact, the world has objectively changed for the better through certain technologies.",

Almost home free in the Criminal portion. \n\nAbout to be dismissed because of Undisputable and Unmendable Material Falsehoods on PCA being the crime is listed taking place hour and 10 minutes after my rest on the PCA and the crime is listed at a different location than the arrest when the PCA narrative says that the crime happened during the arrest. \nbut even if that isn't the case I have them beat all the way down the line on the false arrest on the Peyton Threshold violation on the actual arrest but there was no reason to even be arresting me this is attempted possession of unregistered vehicle my vehicle was registered and I was riding in an Uber and pulled back up to my out of gas Bronco they grilled me on the scene because I didn't have an ID I walked down the street to my town home to get it they came follow me according away left and then knocked on my door 5 minutes later before I could walk back with my ID and a funnel to put the gas in and as soon as I stepped out they just stared at my wrist and I stepped back in and they followed me into my house tackled me on my tile then when immediately promoted to name Arresting charge the lanky Feller hold my face to the tile floor yellow marijuana possession of marijuana they had never missing marijuana before search me or my vehicle and if they had such my vehicle while I was going to Uber they couldn't have because they wouldn't have a warrant so it just made no sense and they never mentioned it again the only thing that happened was when I got to the County Jail I had two felonies for obstruction with violence and assault on officer a law enforcement officer which I didn't either no kick like they claim as we were on the ground. \n\nSo I'm going to have to file a Nelson motion tomorrow to have my public defender fired seized and escorted out of the Kingdom because he has not filed one freaking motion that could have saved me all this time and already got this dismissed but after this comes big civil suit and Claude was instrumental in writing the theory\n\nEdit*// Public Defender won't act not just hasn't. Almost 90 days out from arrest deletion Cycles are running hard I turned in preservation demands but I don't know if they're listening to him or what the only evidence they dropped was body cam at 80+ days and that was on New Year's Eve after a motion to compel hearing was set because of my prostate motion thanks to Claude and  Gang",

          "text": "Hey op. I was involved in a accident about 6 months ago. Attorney is still battling the insurance. The attorney mentioned to me when I asked do you have maximum policy limit they said no. I asked if they had the medical bill and chiropractor bill they said no. The way I found out is I think somebody who was working with this company just recently started and they gave me the whole file meaning my whole progress when it comes to the attorneys and what I have done what they have done and so on. The maximum policy limit is 50,000 I know I'm not going to get 50,000 unless there's an actual way a solid way 100% chance that I'm going to win it. The attorney is 33% and my percentage is 33% and of course the medical bills is going to be 33% as well but there are also going to haggle with the medical and chiropractic bills to lower them. I really don't want to stick to 33% because 16,000 is really not enough for me to get another vehicle and I don't want to get a semi used vehicle. I had not too long ago a 22 Chrysler Pacifica and it worked just fine but the thing is is that I was very nervous and very scared about when the Chrysler Pacifica was going to break down on me. Because those engines and anything pretty much made by Chrysler is made by Mopar parts and when something goes bad it's extremely expensive to replace it. I'm in a Chrysler group and everybody who has even mentioned like say a mass air flow sensor or even sparkle legs cost anywhere between $2,000 to $6,000. That's not including things that I need to get done which is like a throttle body cleaning and sensor replacing because I rather do replacing the sensor then relearn it. And that cost anywhere between 12 to 15,000. \n\nI have been asking chat to help me with what I need to say towards the attorneys that I'm with and he has been helping me out by a lot saying the right things and so on. Not too long ago I pretty much got fed up with this company because they've been lying to me a lot but in a business practice when it comes to attorney side it's not lying and they have been manipulating words that they trying to have me keep going. They charged a person or a company about $300 just to send a $900 check. All that stuff comes out of my own pocket and I don't want that to happen because the more they keep doing that the less I'm going to get. And they wanted me to continue with the pain management side which is the medical group because they say the more shots you get the more payout you're going to get. And chat basically said hey that's a lie because insurance don't care about how many shots you're going to get they care about exactly what happened to you. So that pretty much made sense so I kept doing it and kept going and to the point where it's like I got fed up because they kept lying to me that not a single insurance group out there cares about how many shots you get and how many chiropractic appointments you do. They just care about exactly what happened to you. Now for my part is the base of my neck the bone is pretty close to where the spinal cord is at and now I have these headaches when I cough or when I sneeze that point where the base of the neck is sent a sharp pain from that point all the way up to the top of my head and then I immediately start getting a headache and then my eyeballs start hurting the back part of it. And then my lower bottom right corner were above the hip would be Now I have a pain that pretty much sticks with me every single day and it's not going to go away because it's damaged. \n\n\nNot my question is to you do you think this could work out if I fire my attorney if I let them go and I do this on my own do you believe I could get at least $45,000 out of it? Because let's say I stick with my attorney and I tell him well if you're going to give the attorney $50,000 check you're pretty much getting everything out of that policy limit but if you go through me which is me talking to the insurance company I'll say I rather stick to 45,000 instead of the full $50,000 that way you guys could save more. Wouldn't that make more sense? That's what I would say to the insurance company if I'd let go the attorneys. \n\n\nI'm afraid that I might not get anything even close to 16,000 but if there is a chance and it's higher than let's say 60 to 70% that I could get it then I wouldn't mind firing my attorneys because it's better than paying them right now $16,000 because they could be right now their total money that I owe them could be anywhere between $500 to even a few thousand. \n\n\n\nHas anybody similar done something like this? And won?",

A few even downgraded from the 20x plan.\n*   A small side-debate concluded that **Claude Code is generally superior to Codex**, especially for complex workflows and chaining tasks, though a few dissenters remain.\n*   PSA: No, there isn't a 50% off sale. The \"saving\" refers to the 20x plan offering 4x the usage for only 2x the price of the 5x plan, making it a better value-per-token *if* you can actually use it all.",

Cursor’s billing/usage got stupid, and last week, when I saw that Claude Code was now integrated into the OS app, I finally decided to try it (same process, I tell Claude what I want and it writes the prompt for Claude Code) and I have had to deal with zero errors so far…everything just builds first try. I might have to chase/fix other bugs, but I have not experienced a single compiler error since using Claude Code. CC is a hell of a lot slower, but I’ve saved so much time chasing build errors.

With the Google Ads CSVs I create for my clients, I give it a few of the previous examples I have used and reviewed and let it build off of that. If you weren't sure about the CSV part, Google Ads Editor allows you to upload the CSVs to it, and it makes publishing campaigns super easy.\n\nAnother thing I do is I build out certain chats that only talk about ads and the ad process, etc. I do this to prevent any hallucinations and keep it focused. Like, I wouldn't have it build out campaigns, ask it tax questions, and start building out campaigns again. I've found it is better to stay super on topic to ensure your results don't get corrupted with things you don't want it outputting.",

It’s not celebrating acorns - it’s *worshipping* them. This is less “forest festival” and more “forest cult gathering around the Sacred Acorn.”\n\nAfter minutes of code generation, this is definitely a “well, it’s *technically* what you asked for” result.

It seems like half the sub also built a retirement planner with Claude, and **they all look almost exactly the same.** Apparently, Claude has a default \"vibe-coded\" color palette and UI that it loves to use for these kinds of apps.\n\nFor the tech-savvy, OP explained their process: they used the web UI to brainstorm and generate a `prompt.md` file, then unleashed Claude Code on it. All your data is stored locally in your browser. The thread is also full of great feature requests like adding pensions, customizable tax settings, and better mobile support, which OP is considering. A few salty comments are getting downvoted into oblivion for saying \"Excel could do this,\" but nobody's listening.",

I mostly used Claude Desktop as opposed to fully vibe coding it with Claude Code or other agentic tools. The focus of it is on planning with AI chat & AI insights as opposed to just pure retirement calculations.\n\n  \nI'm also planning on open sourcing the project soon so I totally support that direction. For retirement planning, I don't think that it'll be defensible long term to have fully closed source products. The need for individual customization & logic verification seems too high.\n\nGreat job!",

When I was a financial advisor *many* moons ago, we used a VERY similar tool to talk to our clients!\n\nI have such a stupid critique (and I probably will just fork off and play with the code base myself!) but: there are two features that, to me, would end up making this truly a 'ready for primetime' financial planning tool.\n\nThe first is very nit picky - if you FIRE (or just Retire Early), there's a lot of value in converting 401ks (sometimes up to the tax limit) in some of those early years when your income is exceptionally low and you will otherwise get hit with big, angry RMDs later on. There's also value in leaving Roth accounts alone for as long as possible - because by letting them sit you maximize the tax benefits. I'm not sure exactly what I'm asking for here - maybe allowing the user to modify the *source* of withdrawls after the Retirement phase is calculated? Also, would be totally baller to see 72T withdrawal suggestions/options as well.\n\nThese are totally edge cases, though. For MOST people your current codebase is absolutely fantastic.\n\nThe second is significantly more complicated - basically, it would be interesting to 'stress test' the portfolio, either against historical data, or against multiple (i.e. Monte Carlo type scenario) simulated market scenarios. What's the survival rate? If I retired with my current portfolio projections in 2008, what would that look like? I want to avoid having to go 'back to work' at 75, even in a 'worst case scenario'.\n\nThose are huge asks/critiques. Also - *insurance* planning would be a good/useful feature, although actually out of scope for what you've built.\n\nReally great work though - a fantastic (and cool!) tool!",

Mine includes Monte Carlo simulation for projections based on PERT distributions of portfolio returns, snapshots for storing historical data for comparison to the past, and milestones for making adjustments to income or expenses at future dates (e.g. kids graduate college, sell the business, etc.).\n\nI wanted to explore how Claude would set up and manage the data model. It does surprisingly well at refactorings (at my direction). I've occasionally asked it to review for OOP practices, component reuse, and so on. It's pretty good at identifying and prioritizing these opportunities, then executing on them, as directed.\n\nFor my purposes, the tool replaced a spreadsheet that I have built and been using for the last several years. I reached this MVP in about 6 hrs. after my first installation of CC.\n\nWhile impressive, I think there's a risk. It makes building this sort of software much more accessible, but that can easily loosen the adherence to best practices in many domains. Someone without a software background or domain expertise could easily make bad software that looks like it should do the job but does it in a poor manner that isn't supported by best practices.\n\nAlong the way, Claude has made a number of mistakes. I've had to review behavior pretty closely to make sure that various figures are factored in appropriately and that a healthy quantity of tests back up the development.",

pressing Ctrl+B now backgrounds all running foreground tasks simultaneously\n- Added support for MCP `list_changed` notifications, allowing MCP servers to dynamically update their available tools, prompts, and resources without requiring reconnection\n- Added `/teleport` and `/remote-env` slash commands for claude.ai subscribers, allowing them to resume and configure remote sessions\n- Added support for disabling specific agents using `Task(AgentName)` syntax in settings.json permissions or the `--disallowedTools` CLI flag\n- Added hooks support to agent frontmatter, allowing agents to define PreToolUse, PostToolUse, and Stop hooks scoped to the agent's lifecycle\n- Added hooks support for skill and slash command frontmatter\n- Added new Vim motions: `;` and `,` to repeat f/F/t/T motions, `y` operator for yank with `yy`/`Y`, `p`/`P` for paste, text objects (`iw`, `aw`, `iW`, `aW`, `i\"`, `a\"`, `i'`, `a'`, `i(`, `a(`, `i[`, `a[`, `i{`, `a{`), `>>` and `<<` for indent/dedent, and `J` to join lines\n- Added `/plan` command shortcut to enable plan mode directly from the prompt\n- Added slash command autocomplete support when `/` appears anywhere in input, not just at the beginning\n- Added `--tools` flag support in interactive mode to restrict which built-in tools Claude can use during interactive sessions\n- Added `CLAUDE_CODE_FILE_READ_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` environment variable to override the default file read token limit\n- Added support for `once: true` config for hooks\n- Added support for YAML-style lists in frontmatter `allowed-tools` field for cleaner skill declarations\n- Added support for prompt and agent hook types from plugins (previously only command hooks were supported)\n- Added Cmd+V support for image paste in iTerm2 (maps to Ctrl+V)\n- Added left/right arrow key navigation for cycling through tabs in dialogs\n- Added real-time thinking block display in Ctrl+O transcript mode\n- Added filepath to full output in background bash task details dialog\n- Added Skills as a separate category in the context visualization\n- Fixed OAuth token refresh not triggering when server reports token expired but local expiration check disagrees\n- Fixed session persistence getting stuck after transient server errors by recovering from 409 conflicts when the entry was actually stored\n- Fixed session resume failures caused by orphaned tool results during concurrent tool execution\n- Fixed a race condition where stale OAuth tokens could be read from the keychain cache during concurrent token refresh attempts\n- Fixed AWS Bedrock subagents not inheriting EU/APAC cross-region inference model configuration, causing 403 errors when IAM permissions are scoped to specific regions\n- Fixed API context overflow when background tasks produce large output by truncating to 30K chars with file path reference\n- Fixed a hang when reading FIFO files by skipping symlink resolution for special file types\n- Fixed terminal keyboard mode not being reset on exit in Ghostty, iTerm2, Kitty, and WezTerm\n- Fixed Alt+B and Alt+F (word navigation) not working in iTerm2, Ghostty, Kitty, and WezTerm\n- Fixed `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` not being substituted in plugin `allowed-tools` frontmatter, which caused tools to incorrectly require approval\n- Fixed files created by the Write tool using hardcoded 0o600 permissions instead of respecting the system umask\n- Fixed commands with `$()` command substitution failing with parse errors\n- Fixed multi-line bash commands with backslash continuations being incorrectly split and flagged for permissions\n- Fixed bash command prefix extraction to correctly identify subcommands after global options (e.g., `git -C /path log` now correctly matches `Bash(git log:*)` rules)\n- Fixed slash commands passed as CLI arguments (e.g., `claude /context`) not being executed properly\n- Fixed pressing Enter after Tab-completing a slash command selecting a different command instead of submitting the completed one\n- Fixed slash command argument hint flickering and inconsistent display when typing commands with arguments\n- Fixed Claude sometimes redundantly invoking the Skill tool when running slash commands directly\n- Fixed skill token estimates in `/context` to accurately reflect frontmatter-only loading\n- Fixed subagents sometimes not inheriting the parent's model by default\n- Fixed model picker showing incorrect selection for Bedrock/Vertex users using `--model haiku`\n- Fixed duplicate Bash commands appearing in permission request option labels\n- Fixed noisy output when background tasks complete - now shows clean completion message instead of raw output\n- Fixed background task completion notifications to appear proactively with bullet point\n- Fixed forked slash commands showing \"AbortError\" instead of \"Interrupted\" message when cancelled\n- Fixed cursor disappearing after dismissing permission dialogs\n- Fixed `/hooks` menu selecting wrong hook type when scrolling to a different option\n- Fixed images in queued prompts showing as \"[object Object]\" when pressing Esc to cancel\n- Fixed images being silently dropped when queueing messages while backgrounding a task\n- Fixed large pasted images failing with \"Image was too large\" error\n- Fixed extra blank lines in multiline prompts containing CJK characters (Japanese, Chinese, Korean)\n- Fixed ultrathink keyword highlighting being applied to wrong characters when user prompt text wraps to multiple lines\n- Fixed collapsed \"Reading X files…\" indicator incorrectly switching to past tense when thinking blocks appear mid-stream\n- Fixed Bash read commands (like `ls` and `cat`) not being counted in collapsed read/search groups, causing groups to incorrectly show \"Read 0 files\"\n- Fixed spinner token counter to properly accumulate tokens from subagents during execution\n- Fixed memory leak in git diff parsing where sliced strings retained large parent strings\n- Fixed race condition where LSP tool could return \"no server available\" during startup\n- Fixed feedback submission hanging indefinitely when network requests timeout\n- Fixed search mode in plugin discovery and log selector views exiting when pressing up arrow\n- Fixed hook success message showing trailing colon when hook has no output\n- Multiple optimizations to improve startup performance\n- Improved terminal rendering performance when using native installer or Bun, especially for text with emoji, ANSI codes, and Unicode characters\n- Improved performance when reading Jupyter notebooks with many cells\n- Improved reliability for piped input like `cat refactor.md | claude`\n- Improved reliability for AskQuestion tool\n- Improved sed in-place edit commands to render as file edits with diff preview\n- Improved Claude to automatically continue when response is cut off due to output token limit, instead of showing an error message\n- Improved compaction reliability\n- Improved subagents (Task tool) to continue working after permission denial, allowing them to try alternative approaches\n- Improved skills to show progress while executing, displaying tool uses as they happen\n- Improved skills from `/skills/` directories to be visible in the slash command menu by default (opt-out with `user-invocable: false` in frontmatter)\n- Improved skill suggestions to prioritize recently and frequently used skills\n- Improved spinner feedback when waiting for the first response token\n- Improved token count display in spinner to include tokens from background agents\n- Improved incremental output for async agents to give the main thread more control and visibility\n- Improved permission prompt UX with Tab hint moved to footer, cleaner Yes/No input labels with contextual placeholders\n- Improved the Claude in Chrome notification with shortened help text and persistent display until dismissed\n- Improved macOS screenshot paste reliability with TIFF format support\n- Improved `/stats` output\n- Updated Atlassian MCP integration to use a more reliable default configuration (streamable HTTP)\n- Changed \"Interrupted\" message color from red to grey for a less alarming appearance\n- Removed permission prompt when entering plan mode - users can now enter plan mode without approval\n- Removed underline styling from image reference links\n- [SDK] Changed minimum zod peer dependency to ^4.0.0\n- [VSCode] Added currently selected model name to the context menu\n- [VSCode] Added descriptive labels on auto-accept permission button (e.g., \"Yes, allow npm for this project\" instead of \"Yes, and don't ask again\")\n- [VSCode] Fixed paragraph breaks not rendering in markdown content\n- [VSCode] Fixed scrolling in the extension inadvertently scrolling the parent iframe\n- [Windows] Fixed issue with improper rendering",

Despite the massive changelog, **the overwhelming consensus is that this update is a complete disaster that broke Claude-Code for almost everyone.** The app won't even start due to a simple bug involving an invalid date in the changelog file. Yes, really.\n\nThe community is having a field day, saying Anthropic **'vibecoded' the update** and let Claude write its own code... and it shows. On top of the startup crash, users are also reporting massive memory leaks and that the infamous terminal flickering bug *still* isn't fixed.\n\n**The good news:** Anthropic has already rolled back the update and a patch (v2.1.1) is reportedly available. If you're still stuck on the broken v2.1.0, here's the fix:\n*   Find the `changelog.md` file in your `~/.claude/cache/` directory.\n*   Edit the file to remove the date `(2026-01-07)` from the top line.\n*   Alternatively, run one of the `sed` or `rm` commands shared in the thread to do it automatically.",

      "text": "Contrary to popular belief, LLM assisted coding is an unbelievably difficult skill to master.\n\nCore philosophy: Any issue in LLM generated code is solely due to YOU. Errors are traceable to improper prompting or improper context engineering. Context rot (and lost in the middle) impacts the quality of output heavily, and does so very quickly.\n\nHere are the patterns that actually moved the needle for me. I guarantee you haven't heard of at least one:\n\n1. **Error Logging System** \\- Reconstructing the input-output loop that agentic coding hides from you. Log failures with the exact triggering prompt, categorize them, ask \"what did I do wrong.\" Patterns emerge.\n2. **/Commands as Lightweight Local Apps** \\- Slash commands are secretly one of the most powerful parts of Claude Code. I think of them as Claude as a Service, workflows with the power of a SaaS but way quicker to build.\n3. **Hooks for Deterministic Safety** \\- dangerously-skip-permissions + hooks that prevent dangerous actions = flow state without fear.\n4. **Context Hygiene** \\- Disable autocompact. Add a status line mentioning the % of context used. Compaction is now done when and how YOU choose. Double-escape time travel is the most underutilized feature in Claude Code.\n5. **Subagent Control** \\- Claude Code consistently spawns Sonnet/Haiku subagents even for knowledge tasks. Add \"Always launch opus subagents\" to your global CLAUDE.md. Use subagents way more than you think for big projects. Orchestrator + Subagents >> Claude Code vanilla.\n6. **The Reprompter System** \\- Voice dictation → clarifying questions → structured prompt with XML tags. Prompting at high quality without the friction of typing.\n\nI wrote up a 16 page google doc with more tips and details, exact slash commands, code for a subagent monitoring dashboard, and a quick reference table. Comment 'interested' if you want it.",

Yes, it's annoying. No, there's not a paid course at the end of the rainbow, but there is a link to OP's free \"community\" in the doc.\n\n**The consensus is that despite the cringey delivery, OP's actual tips are legit.** Here's what the power-users in this thread agree on:\n\n*   **Hooks and /Commands are game-changers.** Seriously, use them. They help you enforce workflows, ensure safety, and cut down on context overhead.\n*   **Practice good \"Context Hygiene.\"** Turn off autocompact to avoid \"context rot\" and manually control what's in the window. The \"double-escape time travel\" is just forking the conversation to manage context, not actual time travel.\n*   **Subagents are your friend.** Force Claude Code to use Opus subagents for knowledge tasks to get better results on big projects.\n\nThere's some debate on OP's \"all errors are your fault\" philosophy. Most agree that you need to be a skilled operator to get good results, but let's be real, the model still hallucinates.\n\nP.S. The link is posted about 50 times in this thread. Please stop asking.",

They require a set of skills to push them to their max ability and if you don’t bother learning those skills your results will suck. \n\nEach coding agent harness and llm has its own preferred ways of doing things and you need to lean into these. This is important to realize if you use more than one agent harness or LLM. \n\nThat said these things aren’t magic as I said and they will hallucinate and go off on their own in ways you don’t want regardless of your skill at using them so reviewing their work is still critical.\n\nNow on the list of tips. The OP is on point when talking about Hooks & Slash Commands. Without these not only would my productivity suffer but the code quality would be considerably worse. \n\nDone right Slash Commands are extreme multipliers. They’re indispensable tools not just short cuts. Hooks ensure your staying within your guardrails and desired operating practices. \n\nAlong with core engineering commands I’ve implemented a complete set of commands for planning and brainstorming. Brainstorming is probably my favourite tool set. When dealing with a gnarly problem, an unfamiliar code base, anything I don’t understand or just building something new I use my brainstorming tools first rather than jumping straight into planning. I explore, question and get critical push back on my idea then I use this knowledge and context to generate a plan, prompt, etc.\n\nWe went from prompts to plans but I’m hoping more people take a step back before planning. imo the outcomes will far exceed the extra time spent. It’s also a super way to learn. \n\nCheers. 👍",

Even at 10k context per subagent, 8x --> 80k, then some amount to process the return and effectively you will burn an entire 200k context window on 1 run of 8 subagents.  Have you gotten this math to work out better? If I increase number of agents I cap the context before the window finishes.    I break all tasks into orthogonal atomich units before beginning and color code them based on what agent does what in the plan",

The writing is clear and high-quality. Good insights and a cool idea I haven't seen before. I def want to try out something like the \"error logging\" pattern. And I'll check out the rest of the doc.\n\nThanks for sharing :)\n\nP.S. I love the description of LLMs as \"having most convoluted input-output\" learning loop. Matches my experience exactly. Amazing tools with an absolutely insane learning curve.",

      "text": "I’ve noticed a trend lately (both in myself and colleagues) where the passion for software development seems to be fading, and I think I’ve pinpointed why.\n\nWe often say that LLMs are great because they handle the \"boring stuff\" while we focus on the big picture. But here is the problem: while the Architecture is still decided by the developer, the Implementation is now done by the AI.\n\nAnd I’m starting to realize that the implementation was actually the fun part.\n\nHere is my theory on why this is draining the joy out of the job:\n\n1. Writing vs. Reviewing: coding used to be a creative act. You enter a \"flow state,\" solving micro-problems and building something from nothing. Now, the workflow is: *Prompt -> Generate -> Read Code -> Fix Code.* We have effectively turned the job into an endless Code Review session. And let's be honest, code review has always been the most tedious part of the job.\n2. The \"Janitor\" Effect: it feels like working with a Junior Developer who types at the speed of light but makes small but subtle, weird mistakes. Instead of being the Architect/Builder, I feel like the Janitor, constantly cleaning up after the AI.\n3. Loss of the \"Mental Map\": when you write code line-by-line, you build a mental map of how everything connects. When an LLM vomits out 50 lines of boilerplate, you don't have that deep understanding. Debugging code you didn't write is cognitively much heavier and less rewarding than fixing your own logic.\n\nThe third point is probably the one I dislike the most.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the productivity boost is undeniable. But I feel like we are trading \"craftsmanship\" for \"speed.\"\n\nIs anyone else feeling this? Do you miss the actual *act* of coding, or are you happy to just be the \"director\" while the AI does the acting?\n\nTL;DR: LLMs take away the implementation phase, leaving us with just architecture and code review. Code review is boring.",

The thread is **deeply divided, basically splitting the dev community in half.**\n\n*   **Camp \"This Sucks, I Miss Coding\":** A huge chunk of you are nodding along with OP's existential dread. You feel the \"flow state\" and craftsmanship have been replaced by the soul-crushing tedium of endless code review. The most-upvoted complaint is the **loss of the \"mental map,\"** which turns debugging into a nightmare. As OP put it, you've gone from being a builder to a \"janitor\" cleaning up after a hyperactive junior dev.\n\n*   **Camp \"Congrats, You've Been Promoted\":** Then there's the other half, mostly senior devs, who are loving it. After 20+ years, they're thrilled to offload the boring boilerplate and focus on the big picture. They see it as a natural evolution of the job, basically what a Staff Engineer does anyway. The productivity boost is undeniable, and they're happy to be the \"director\" instead of the actor.\n\nSome are finding a middle ground by using Claude as a souped-up Stack Overflow for specific tasks, but still writing the core logic themselves to maintain control and avoid losing their minds.",

Now a days new woodworkers start with power tools and work their way “backwards” to hand tools as their craftsmanship increases. Woodworking masters are those that have learned when to use the power tool and when to use the hand tools. I suspect coding will always be like that too.",

It reminds me of the internet in 90s where I had to wait for images to load on my 9600 modem.

          "text": "I think what's happening is there are 2 camps of developers and it's probably influenced by how long you have been a developer.  You either enjoy coming up with solutions that provide value for the business or you enjoy the creation / modelling of the code.  \n\nI mean you obviously can enjoy both but I feel when I started out 25 years ago it was all about the code, your producing something and there was a buzz when you solved a particularly gnarly issue in an unknown way, and then blogged about it.  Something to shout about.  There was also the flow state, where in a blink of an eye the day has gone and you felt good.\n\nBut after time you come to realise you starting to churn out the same code regardless of the language / framework and actually maybe some of the things being requested don't make sense, maybe it's more efficient to do this business process this way or why are we duplicating this reference data and gradually the actually implementation doesn't really matter, it's the cost and benefit that does.\n\nAt the moment there is definitely an advantage of having that deep technical knowledge because I no longer need to worry about spending time on fiddly bits I can just think more about the bigger picture.    \n  \nA basic simple example - got an App which is merging communications from different APIs - thing call recordings, Whatsapp, Emails etc.  A simple interface - now need to display the image attachments from the Whatsapp messages, group them together if they run in sequence and display in a lightbox.  All straightforward especially if you standardise on component libraries - we use Primeflex.  At the sametime let's have the ability to click on a specific image in the lightbox and then go full screen and have the ability to zoom and pan around it.   That bit of functionality is not supported by that component.\n\nAgain all doable nothing revolutionary - I gave Claude an example of the API payload and it banged it out in about 20 minutes, implemented the UI, added the lightbox and created the custom add on to zoom in on the image.\n\nI think realistically the Zoom feature would have not been implemented if I hand coded, the cost / effort to deliver it would have not been worthwhile. \n\nI would recommend to any developer to look at Service Management (ITIL) - you can do a short course.  You don't have to become a Service Manager but it will help to give you a business perspective on IT.",

A mantra you should have in your mind when building something is - does it provide business value - either by offering a new service to drive more revenue or does it increase efficiency in the business and therefore releasing that resource to work on something that will increase profit.  Other development work happens of course but you start to get on shaky ground about value.\n\nA company I used to work for - a large US Asset Management company had a rule if they could buy software off the shelf which matched 80% of their need then we wouldn't do custom development to meet the other 20%.",

Tune Claude's tone (level of verbosity, etc.) to prioritize reviewability of code.  \n\\- PLAN.  I've been adding plans to MRs to make fine tuning and iteration easy (edit the markdown to make any corrections and have Claude re-read it -- and/or provide prompts to tune the direction) -- and later in the MR they get incorporated into the session history file that gets added to the MR.    \n\\- Track \"lessons learned\" in the session history files and include in the MR enhancements to the various context files or skills / sub-agents to improve the software's mental map or rules.",

I'd just instruct it to write a specialized integration test or an ad-hoc test to realize what's happening, and 99% of the time it works. This got me horribly lazy.\n\nFurthermore, I'd comment also about your last statement - yes, the productivity IS crazy, but I worry about what it does to us. Not like if we'll forget to code - I know we won't. After being an engineer in the most productive part of my career, I've had 5 solid years of doing exactly what we do now with LLMs - managing, reviewing others' code, doing architecture, and final integration. After that I've had 2-3 years of solid and strong engineering, proving to myself that this is like riding a bicycle - you don't really forget it. But this last year of doing LLM-based development with CC is basically like I'm back in that part of my management career, which, in all honesty, I really didn't like.\n\nSo, I sympathize a lot with your post and the sentiment you describe.",

Being able to summarize large chunks of code or debug problems in minutes vs hours has been truly game-changing for me.

          "text": "This actually came to pass yesterday when this happened \n\nI use AI at work mostly for bug fixes and things like that but I wanted to try  to \"vibe code\" an app last month and started with Gemini pro because they did the free month trial. It started out amazing and I was seeing things on screen that would have taken me days.   \nAs the app grew Gemini started falling apart, adding and deleting random things no matter the guard rails I gave it. So I switched to claude code and that was great. But the limits are ridiculous. A few targeted prompts and I was done for the day. Then at day 5, I was done for the week and had to wait 2 days. \n\nI say to myself, whatever, I can just work on this for 2 days until it resets. But there is the issue, so much code was added that I was \"reviewing\" but when all that is going on, it's hard to reason about everything. The app grew large quickly. \n\nI ended up feeling quite useless. Kind of like a manager, scrum master, or a BA at work that spends their days just going from meeting to meeting. \n\nAll of this to realize that the app I was building, maybe I was going faster, but was I really? Sure it was unblocking bugs that would have stopped me before because I'm using mental energy to solve them after a work day, or on the weekend .... so I may just put it off. But actual working time, where I am sitting down doing the work, was it saving me that much? Probably, but the risk is as it grows I know it as a product, but don't know what is really happening anymore. \n\nOf course I can have the AI summarize things, or tell me what is going on, but it's not the same. \n\n  \nAlso, how is this impacting my health, personality, and all of that. I've noticed getting lazier with solving things. I was asking the AI to so simple fixes that I know how to resolve. That is not only an issue with the app, but if that type of behavior extends beyond this, it's not a good thing. \n\nIf I am not using my critical thinking skills, brain power, and all of that, am I just setting myself up for early onset dementia? Seriously ?\n\nAgain, I'm not 100% convinced I am saving much time. And all of the coders talking about how they vibe coded app X - who cares? Are they actually selling anything? Writing an app is the easy part even when hand coding it yourself. Getting people to buy in is the hard part",

I thoroughly believe that with right guardrails this or Claude Cowork are the natural evolution of computers.\n\n​The Project:\nIt’s called TerminaI. It is a Sovereign, Local-First System Operator.\n\n​Cowork vs. TerminaI:\n​Cowork: Cloud-tethered, $100/mo, opaque safety rails.\n​TerminaI: Runs on your metal, Free (Apache 2.0), and uses a \"System 2\" policy engine that asks for permission before doing dangerous things.\n\n​The \"Limitless\" Difference:\nBecause I don't have a corporate legal team, I didn't nerf the capabilities. TerminaI has limitless power (it can run any command, manage any server, fix any driver)—but it is governed by a strict Approval Ladder (Guardrails) that you control.\n​\n​I may not have their marketing budget, but I have the better architecture for privacy.",

The top comments are all variations of \"Lmao, check out my new app called Windows\" or \"Big MacOS.\"\n\nBeyond the name, users are skeptical of OP's claims:\n\n*   **It's not entirely original:** Commenters quickly pointed out that this is a fork of Google's `gemini-cli` and that similar open-source tools like `Goose` already exist.\n*   **It's not really \"free\":** You still need to provide your own API key (which costs money) or have a powerful enough machine to run a local LLM.\n*   **The target audience is unclear:** Tech-savvy users might already have their own workflows, and this is too complex for non-technical users who Claude Cowork is aimed at.\n\nTo OP's credit, they did show up to defend the project's technical merits, arguing it's a true 'System Operator' unlike Claude Code because it has no usage rate limits, can get root access, and can handle interactive prompts like `sudo` passwords. However, one of these detailed replies was admittedly written with AI, which drew further skepticism.\n\nThe verdict? **Cool idea, but the community feels the 'I built this for free' pitch is disingenuous and the name is a certified disaster.** OP has since conceded that a name change is in order.",

But i was totally wrong. \n\nOne of my friend asked me to build a web app for their university  to show the complex university timetable in a simple day wise format for each roll number, because university send them really bad .xlsx format data, many students miss their classes. \n\nlast time, it took me around a week to write whole app and all the python scripts to correctly arrange the classes, faculty and timetable for ~500 students in simple JSON format.(i used gemini cli back then in November)\n\nyesterday, new semester timetable came out, i had to update app, as usual i open Gemini cli but it started going in wrong direction from the first prompt. \n\nI thought let's try Opus 4.5(in Antigravity). \n\ni copy pasted that same prompt from gemini to Opus and here i'm after 10 minutes, writing this post. Literally mind blown with what Opus  managed to do. It correctly understood everything, arranged every .xlsx file data into simple JSON. It Opened Chrome and successfully tested for each student all within 7 minutes. \n\ni was thinking i would complete the work in 7-8 hours using gemini cli but completed everything in under 7-8 minutes. Opus 4.5 is just insane.\n\nAnthropic, we don't ask for Opus 5, just declare 4.5 as AGI and work only on reducing its cost. \n",

Most agree it's worth it for now, but fear the eventual \"enshitification.\"\n*   **The Reality Check:** A few wise owls reminded everyone that code generated in minutes can still take hours to review. Concerns about model consistency and \"lobotomization\" also popped up.\n*   **The Existential Dread:** One user's story of replacing a 10-person team with Claude had everyone pondering if we're all doomed.\n*   **The Derailment:** The thread also took a wild, personal, and frankly unhinged detour into a user's life story, gun metaphors, and Tekken.

In that year they came up with lousy looking system far from my expectations. Couple integrations, couple screens, nothing worth of the money, and no sales. They were all ex top management of a successful startup they built from scratch (will, almost scratch, i was the founder). After exit, new owners obviously replaced top managers with their own people, so this set decided to make the second shot. I funded them and basically let them do what they want to have my idea implemented. Took a year to understand it's not going well, but at least we had some fun.\n\nIn the first few days (*DAYS*!!) of this year i did a very solid foundation to the product i wanted all that time, but with Claude code, and paid about $200-300 so far. When i day foundation i mean a unpolished mvp that works and does what i want it to do (not particularly easy thing) + i built an autopilot that does some role play (i did ceo, pm, techlead, developer, tester roles - and they decompose my ideas level by level and execute on different models, with most of coding and local work happening on 5090 + Claude code as planner (PM)+ openai as auditor). I give it some vague idea and see how a bunch of \"people\" in mattermost talk to me as if they were my colleagues. But they are bots of respective roles and develop another (main) project.\n\nIt's insane.\n\nUnfortunately I don't see much opportunities for my ex team in this new world. Or anyone of cognitive labor. Imagine this thing in a year!\n\nBut there is some good news - anyone can do everything by themselves, or maybe with a very limited community of enthusiasts, not 200 people team like i had. A team of 200 Claudes will cost much, much less and can do much much more. \n\nAnyone can do explosive amount of good. \nBut how does it matter when nobody has a job, i don't know.",

There's something appealing about that combination of intelligence and a bit of mischief.\n\"",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 100 comments.**\n\nAlright, let's break it down. The top comments are calling BS, comparing this to a **\"shovel seller claiming he only uses his own shovels to make new shovels\"** or the Coca-Cola CEO claiming to only drink Coke. Most of the thread is skeptical of the headline at face value.\n\nHowever, the more nuanced consensus is that the claim is likely true, but it redefines what \"contribution\" means. The key takeaway is that **this signals a fundamental shift in the developer's role from a code *writer* to a code *director*.**\n\n*   **The Human is the Architect:** Users argue the dev is still doing the heavy lifting of planning, designing architecture, defining the problem, and making high-level decisions. Claude is just the tool that types out the implementation.\n*   **It's Not \"One-Shot\" Magic:** Experienced users confirm they get 80-100% of their code from Claude, but it's not easy. It requires a massive upfront investment in planning and a complex workflow involving test-driven development (TDD), review agents, and constant supervision.\n*   **Claude Still Goofs:** Many point out that Claude still makes silly mistakes, gets stuck in loops, and chooses poor architectural patterns. A knowledgeable human is essential to catch these errors and get the AI back on track.\n*   **It's Called \"Dogfooding\":** Several users note that of course an Anthropic employee would be using their own tool 100% of the time. It's their job to find the rough edges and bugs (and according to one comment, there are ~6,500 open issues, so there's plenty to find).\n\nSo, the verdict is: **The claim is probably not a lie, but it's not the \"AGI is here\" moment some think it is.** The human is still very much in the driver's seat; they've just traded their keyboard for a prompt box.",

They are also free to do a lot more conscious and deliberate design decisioning. \n\nBut, I'm not going to lie, the first 4 months of this was rough. Getting your feet under you takes some effort. It's a shift in thinking. You basically need every engineer to be one part management, one part PM, one part architect and one part engineering lead. The engineers that can do that absolutely smoke everyone else. The engineers that can't... Well... Don't. \n\nThis year one thing became increasingly clear to me: the ability to organize and manage will be core engineering skills within the next 24 months. The introvert engineer that just wants to be left alone to tinker is going to get shut out unless they adapt. AI development actually requires MORE face time, not less. Otherwise you get some dude mangling a database at hyper speed, instead of steady, predictable, secure and quality code coming at a high velocity. Engineering becomes more about discussion, design, decisions and oversight than being the code ninja. And.. honestly... To those who didn't already know it, it already was and has been for years. Look at the highest ranking engineers in your company. They aren't locking themselves up and then popping up with brand new tools and products that they miraculously made. They spend at least half their time in meetings and writing documents. Policies, diagrams, decision logs, proposals, data justifications, metric reporting, etc. All of which turns into directives that turned into prompts handed to you to go implement. They have been the engineer. YOU were the coding agent. Plan your future accordingly. Good luck and happy hunting.",

So yeah, you're asking for the banhammer.\n*   **This is why we can't have nice things.** The most upvoted comments argue that this kind of behavior is exactly what leads to stricter limits for everyone. Please don't ruin it for the rest of us.\n*   For those confused, the script **doesn't bypass the weekly limit.** It just tries to game the 5-hour rolling window for convenience. The risk is not worth the reward.\n*   Also, the nerds in the thread are roasting the script's implementation, saying you should at least use `crontab` if you're going to get yourself banned efficiently.\n\n**Bottom line: The community thinks this is a selfish and risky move. Just use Claude normally or pay for more if you need it.**",

      "text": "I've been using Claude Code intensely over the past 11 months since its launch, and I've even compiled [a list of 40+ tips](https://github.com/ykdojo/claude-code-tips).\n\nHere, I wanted to share what I think are the 10 most important ones to get you started on this journey.\n\n# 1. Minimize the provided context\n\nThe longer the given context, the worse it performs. So make sure to learn different ways of minimizing the provided context.\n\nThe simple one to get started with is starting a fresh conversation whenever you start a new topic.\n\nAnother quick one is:\n\n* In the first conversation, find which files you need to edit to solve your problem\n* In the second, fresh conversation, figure out how to edit them exactly\n\nRemember, AI context is like milk; it's best served fresh and condensed.\n\n# 2. Solve a problem step by step\n\nClaude models tend to be pretty good at long-lasting tasks, but they're not perfect.\n\nSometimes they make mistakes and they mess up things especially when it's given a problem that's too large.\n\nSo in that case, just break your problem down into smaller steps. And if they're still too big for Claude to solve in one shot, then break them down further.\n\n# 3. Don't always jump into writing code\n\nAI gets a bad rep for low quality code because a lot of people just primarily use it for writing code.\n\nBut understand that it's great for understanding a codebase, doing research, brainstorming, architectural discussions, etc.\n\nDoing enough preparation before jumping into writing code is one of the essential keys for producing high quality code.\n\n# 4. Learn to use Git and GitHub well\n\nJust ask Claude to handle your Git and GitHub CLI tasks. This includes committing (so you don't have to write commit messages manually), branching, pulling, and pushing.\n\nI personally allow pull automatically but not push, because push is riskier.\n\nYou can even let it run `git bisect` to find the exact commit that broke something. It'll need a way to test each commit, so you might need to give it a test script.\n\n# 5. Learn to check the output of AI in different ways\n\nOne way to verify its output if it's code is to have it write tests.\n\nAnother thing is you can use a visual Git client like GitHub Desktop for example. I personally use it. It's not a perfect product, but it's good enough for checking changes quickly.\n\nHaving it generate a draft PR is a great way as well. You can review everything before marking it ready for review.\n\n# 6. Learn to let AI verify its own code and other output\n\nYou can let it check itself, its own work. If it gives you some sort of output, let's say from some research, you can say \"are you sure about this? Can you double check?\"\n\nOne of my favorite prompts is to say \"double check everything, every single claim in what you produced and at the end make a table of what you were able to verify.\" That seems to work really well.\n\nIf you're building a web app, you can use Playwright MCP or Claude's native browser integration (through `/chrome`) to let it verify that everything works correctly.\n\nFor Claude for Chrome, I recommend adding this to your CLAUDE.md so it uses accessibility tree refs instead of coordinates (better for speed and accuracy):\n\n    # Claude for Chrome\n    \n    - Use `read_page` to get element refs from the accessibility tree\n    - Use `find` to locate elements by description\n    - Click/interact using `ref`, not coordinates\n    - NEVER take screenshots unless explicitly requested by the user\n\nFor interactive CLIs, you can use tmux. The pattern is: start a tmux session, send commands to it, capture the output, and verify it's what you expect.\n\n# 7. Set up a custom status line\n\nYou can customize the status line at the bottom of Claude Code. [I set mine up](https://github.com/ykdojo/claude-code-tips?tab=readme-ov-file#tip-0-customize-your-status-line) to show the model, current directory, git branch, uncommitted file count, sync status with origin, and a visual progress bar for token usage.\n\nIt's really helpful for keeping an eye on your context usage and remembering what you were working on.\n\n# 8. Learn how to pass context to the next session\n\nThere's a `/compact` command in Claude Code that summarizes your conversation to free up context space. But I found that it's better to proactively manage context yourself.\n\nThe way I do this is to ask Claude to write a handoff document before starting fresh. Something like: \"Put the rest of the plan in HANDOFF.md. Explain what you have tried, what worked, what didn't work, so that the next agent with fresh context is able to just load that file and nothing else to get started on this task and finish it up.\"\n\nThen you start a fresh conversation and give it just the path of that file, and it should work just fine.\n\nI also created a [half-clone command](https://github.com/ykdojo/claude-code-tips?tab=readme-ov-file#half-clone-to-reduce-context) that clones the current conversation but keeps only the later half. It's a quick way to reduce context while preserving your recent work.\n\n# 9. Learn to use voice input well\n\nI found that you can communicate much faster with your voice than typing with your hands. Using a voice transcription system on your local machine is really helpful for this.\n\nOn my Mac, I've tried a few different options like superwhisper, MacWhisper, and [Super Voice Assistant](https://github.com/ykdojo/super-voice-assistant). Even when there are mistakes or typos in the transcription, Claude is smart enough to understand what you're trying to say.\n\nI think the best way to think about this is like you're trying to communicate with your friend. If you want to communicate faster, why wouldn't you get on a quick phone call? You can just send voice messages. It's faster, at least for me. For a majority of people, it's going to be faster too.\n\n# 10. Learn to juggle a few sessions at the same time\n\nWhen you're running multiple Claude Code instances, staying organized matters more than any specific technical setup. I'd say focus on at most three or four tasks at a time, at least at the beginning.\n\nMy personal method is what I call a \"cascade.\" Whenever I start a new task, I just open a new tab on the right. Then I sweep left to right, left to right, going from oldest tasks to newest. The general direction stays consistent, except when I need to check on certain tasks.\n\n# 11. (Bonus) Alias 'claude' to 'c'\n\nSince I use the terminal more because of Claude Code, I found it helpful to set up short aliases so I can launch things quickly. The one I use the most is `c` for Claude Code.\n\nTo set it up, add this line to your shell config file (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`):\n\n    alias c='claude'\n\nOnce you have this alias, you can combine it with flags: `c -c` continues your last conversation, and `c -r` shows a list of recent conversations to resume.",

This saves your context window and it's like the bug never existed. You can do this will all kinds of side task that benefit from the current context.\n\nFor #4 I have it commit after every change with a detailed message log and tell it to use git stats as it's 'memory'. This way we can pickup in a new session and I just have it review the git history for today or however long we've been working. Saves having to write out a handoff doc or saves you if you forget and run out of context (I keep auto compact OFF). \n\nAlso subagents, subagents are awesome and getting a lot done and most of the time you can use something like Haiku and get them done FAST with oversight from Opus.",

Sometimes I even had about half of my quota left.\n\nI figured I’d optimize my spending a bit, switch to Pro, and use the rest to buy Codex, which IMHO is simply better for reviews. I also wanted to use the money I saved to try out Cursor or Gemini.\n\nBut on the Pro plan, literally a few requests to hook data up to the UI — where both parts are already done — drains my limit in less than an hour. It happen a few times in less that 2 days.\n\nSo I guess I’ll have to swallow my pride and go back to Max, and buy chatgpt plus separately.\n\nEdit: I may not have emphasized this clearly: it’s not about the Pro limits (though the plan should not be named pro), but that those limits aren’t 5× lower than Max — I have the impression they’re more like 10× lower",

Using Opus on the Pro plan will drain your quota almost instantly, with some users hitting their 5-hour limit in as little as 15-30 minutes or after just a few prompts.\n\nA few users are pushing back, calling it a \"skill issue\" and suggesting better context management. The main workarounds to make Pro usable are:\n*   **Use Sonnet or Haiku** for most tasks and save Opus for only the most complex problems.\n*   **Be ruthless with context:** Start new chats frequently and manage your context window.\n*   **Combine services:** Many are using Pro alongside ChatGPT Plus or other competitors (GLM, Kimi, Codex) to get their work done, switching to another service when Claude's limits are hit.\n\nHilariously, one user who upgraded to the Max plan claims they *still* have to manage their usage more than they did on Pro a few months ago, suggesting the limits might be getting squeezed across the board. So, yeah, you're not crazy, OP.",

But instead of just drafting a response, it went full autonomous:\n\n1. Searched my inbox for the tenant's emails\n2. Read the full thread to get context\n3. Opened the rental contract (I keep it as Markdown)\n4. Modified the 2 clauses my tenant was asking about\n5. Converted it to PDF with Pandoc\n6. Sent the updated contract back as an attachment\n\nI was just... watching. No prompting each step. It figured out what needed to happen and did it.\n\n# How I set this up\n\n**The Gmail part:**\n\nI built a simple Python CLI wrapper around Gmail API yesterday. Nothing fancy - just OAuth2 auth and basic operations exposed as commands:\n\n    gm search \"from:john\"           # search emails\n    gm thread <id>                  # read full conversation\n    gm send \"to\" \"subj\" \"body\" -a file.pdf   # send with attachment\n    gm reply <id> \"message\"         # reply to a thread\n    \n\nIt's maybe 200 lines of Python. The magic is that Claude Code can just call these from bash like any other tool.\n\n**The rest:**\n\n* Claude Code CLI (Opus 4.5) on WSL2\n* Contracts in Markdown with some LaTeX for signatures\n* Pandoc for the PDF conversion\n\n# What Claude actually ran\n\n    gm search \"from:tenant\"     → found the emails\n    gm thread <id>              → read the conversation  \n    cat contract.md             → checked the current contract\n    vim contract.md             → edited 2 lines\n    pandoc → contract.pdf       → generated the PDF\n    gm send -a contract.pdf     → sent it back\n    \n\nThe whole thing took maybe 2 minutes.\n\n[claude code terminal doing all the job](https://preview.redd.it/kmdiaa7md5cg1.png?width=862&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbe3b042e12363e1bea4ff9ce5c6cabbb17ef054)\n\n[gmail web](https://preview.redd.it/qt5h71pmd5cg1.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=63738070b38c5f0bc6d48f7ad94b614dae2256cd)\n\n# Takeaway\n\nYou don't need complex integrations. Just give Claude Code some CLI tools and it chains them together on its own. I'm probably going to build more of these - calendar, bank statements, who knows.\n\nAnyone else doing something similar?",

Several users shared horror stories of AIs making costly legal mistakes. The general advice is to at least have it save to a draft for your review.\n\nFinally, a significant number of people are calling BS on the whole post, finding the idea of keeping legal contracts in Markdown to be unbelievable. The phrase \"this post was written by Claude\" came up more than once.\n\nDespite the criticism, a few users appreciated the technical showcase and were inspired to build their own, safer versions of your CLI-based agent.",

Reading some of the comments criticising you absolutely confirmed my hesitation to posting about the way I use it - and I’m sure I’m not the only one doing magic with Claude Code that will not share it out of fear of trolls. I give Claude access to my tax and invoicing software, my email, my HR management software, my CRM… via MCPs and pure CLI or API access; and it is amazing. It goes through my email, downloads invoices, saves them as PDF and renames them to my convention and uploads them to my invoice software; it reads and writes emails based on all the CRM history, reviews Word docx contracts and adds comments and suggestions for edits… I would never post here exactly how I do it because of all the people just telling you how unimpressive it actually is, or how you must be a fake Anthropic account or how what you are doing is actually a bad idea. But I appreciate you. And you are not alone in this. It’s fucking amazing. It’s obviously the future.",

They realise 'thank you for your service' is marketing bs. The world war 2 generation were heroes. Since then the military has just been political leaders using them for unjust foreign wars. Now they are washed up and this is the only way they can make some dolar. A few are ashamed and cover their faces. The rest I have little sympathy for because they joined the forces to exercise their macho/fascist or narcissistic tendencies. Even so I appreciate the military for when we may need them to defend us from attack. Sadly the modern military seems to be on the side of the Russians anyway nowadays. What's that about? Also it seems if we ever did get attacked historically its unwilling conscripted troops that have to sort it out anyway. America is lost under Trump.",

However, the community pushed back hard, defending Sonnet as a great generalist model for creative writing and translation.

      "text": "Been using Claude Pro pretty heavily for over 6 months and kept hitting the 40-100 message cap mid-project. Got frustrated enough to actually dig into how the token system works.\n\nTurns out most of us are wasting 70% of our message quota without realizing it.\n\n**The problem:** Long conversation threads don't just eat up your message count – they exponentially waste tokens. A 50-message thread uses 5x more processing power than five 10-message chats because Claude re-reads the entire history every single time.\n\n**Here's what actually moves the needle:**\n\n**1. Start fresh chats at 15-20 messages**\n\nOne 50-message thread = full capacity used. Five 10-message chats = 5x capacity gained.\n\nThe work output is the same, but you just unlocked 5x more sessions before hitting limits.\n\n**2. Use meta-prompts to compress context**\n\nAt the end of each session, ask Claude: \"Summarize our discussion in 200 words formatted as: key decisions made, code patterns established, next steps identified. Format as a system prompt for my next chat.\"\n\nPaste that summary into your next fresh chat.\n\nYou just compressed 5,000 tokens → 300 tokens (16x compression). Full context, 6% of the cost.\n\n**3. Stop at 7 messages remaining**\n\nWhen you see \"7 messages left,\" STOP starting new complex tasks. Use those final messages for summaries only. Then start fresh in a new chat.\n\nStarting a new debugging session with 7 messages left = guaranteed limit hit mid-solution.\n\n**Results after implementing these:**\n\nBefore: 40-60 messages/day, constant limit frustration After: 150-200 effective messages/day, rarely hit caps\n\nI working on documenting this system with copy-paste templates. \n\nHappy to share, I didn't want to spam the group. Feel free to DM me.\n\nHas anyone used similar techniques as this?  Are there any other tricks you found for staying under limits?",

          "text": "**TL;DR generated automatically after 100 comments.**\n\n**The consensus is a big 'ol 'thank you' to OP for the helpful reminder, even if this isn't exactly groundbreaking news for the veterans in the room.** The community overwhelmingly agrees with the core principle: **long chat threads absolutely demolish your message limits** because Claude has to re-process the entire history with every single message.\n\nHowever, the thread is full of refinements and corrections to OP's manual method:\n\n*   **The biggest takeaway: Use the built-in `/compact` command.** Instead of manually asking for a summary and copy-pasting it into a new chat, just type `/compact`. Claude will summarize the conversation and clear the context for you, achieving the same goal with way less effort. You can also use `/clear` to start completely fresh.\n\n*   **A key correction: Summarizing is *not* the same as having \"full context.\"** Several users pointed out that this is a form of lossy compression. You will lose nuance and specific details, which can cause Claude to \"lose the plot\" on very complex or long-running projects.\n\n*   **For the true power-users, the conversation evolved to more advanced tools.** People are recommending frameworks like `Superpowers` and `Beads` for managing complex, multi-session coding projects, which are built on this same principle of context management.\n\n*   **Other tidbits:** The limits are also affected by dynamic server-side throttling, and responding quickly (within 5-10 mins) can help keep your chat in the cache, reducing token usage. Also, for the pedants, the token usage growth is quadratic, not exponential.\n\nSo yeah, manage your context, use `/compact`, and don't be a jerk to people sharing helpful tips.",

          "text": "I just sort of assumed this was common knowledge. Like if you're a developer, you're in a great position to understand how AI works. Not knowing how AI works is what leads to getting bad results from AI. It's also literally how billing works when you're paying per token. This is exactly why token caching matters. I'm sure you've heard of this term before, right? Push yourself to learn about a concept if you hear about it and don't know what it is if you're relying on AI.\n\nAnyway,  to catch you up:  \nToken caching is something used to mitigate this exact behavior. You want to hit the cache. There are some things that happen that will make you miss it, such as waiting too long before your next response. Hitting the cache allows you to negate a huge percentage of the input tokens that have already been processed. So why you hit your limit could be far more nuanced, such as having long conversations and spacing out messages a lot. \n\nAlso, this is why providers literally charge more per Mtok after you exceed a certain amount of tokens. Generating a response for a short conversation is cheap and fast, but  given it has to compute the ENTIRE conversation, a long conversation is absolute killer in computation. \n\nThat's not even the only reason to start new conversations. Remember, an AI is meant to generate what it thinks should go next based on statistics and some other stuff. Think about it like a human. How easy would it be for you to tell me what you think happens next in a short fairy tale? You'd likely be able to guess what happens next very easily because they're nice and short with a limited amount of characters, etc. There are also a TON of examples of those types of fairy tales so your brain will intuitively use that historical knowledge to clue you in into what might happen next.  \n  \nNow think about trying to guess what happens next halfway through Game of Thrones. The context halfway through is massive, there's way too much going on, way too many characters, places, and as time has gone on, it has become less and less predictable. You might be able to do a good job of it, but you're going to do a much worse job than if it was a short story. And how many books are the length of Game of Thrones and maintain the same themes and plot archs? The longer it goes, the more unique it gets, the more likely the AI gets lost in the sauce, and the quality of your responses goes down drastically.",

It's so over.\n\n*   The outage seems sporadic, with Claude coming back online for a few minutes before dying again. The common error is `Overloaded` or \"Taking longer than usual.\"\n*   Some users report the VS Code extension or API was still working when the web UI was down. Others found the Haiku model was more stable than Opus or Sonnet.\n*   You can check the official Anthropic status page for updates: `https://status.claude.com`\n*   There's also a growing sentiment that these outages have been happening a lot more frequently over the last few weeks.",

      "text": "Original post: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1ky1y7z/i_accidentally_built_a_vector_database_using)\n\nSix months ago, I published a weird weekend experiment where I stored text embeddings inside video frames.\n\nI expected maybe 20 people to see it. Instead it got:\n\n* Over 10M views\n* 10k stars on GitHub \n* And thousands of other developers building with it.\n\nOver 1,000 comments came in, some were very harsh, but I also got some genuine feedback. I spoke with many of you and spent the last few months building Memvid v2: it’s faster, smarter, and powerful enough to replace entire RAG stacks.\n\n\n\nThanks for all the support.\n\nPs: I added a little surprise at the end for developers and OSS builders 👇\n\n\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Memvid replaces RAG + vector DBs entirely with a single portable memory file.\n* Stores knowledge as Smart Frames (content + embedding + time + relationships)\n* 5 minute setup and zero infrastructure.\n* Hybrid search with sub-5ms retrieval\n* Fully portable and open Source\n\n**What my project does?** Give your AI Agent Memory In One File.\n\n**Target Audience:** Everyone building AI agent.\n\n**GitHub Code:**[ https://github.com/memvid/memvid](https://github.com/memvid/memvid)\n\n—----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Some background:**\n\n* AI memory has been duct-taped together for too long.\n* RAG pipelines keep getting more complex, vector DBs keep getting heavier, and agents still forget everything unless you babysit them. \n* So we built a completely different memory system that replaces RAG and vector databases entirely.  \n\n**What is Memvid:**\n\n* Memvid stores everything your agent knows inside a single portable file, that your code can read, append to, and update across interactions.\n* Each fact, action and interaction is stored as a self‑contained “Smart Frame” containing the original content, its vector embedding, a timestamp and any relevant relationships. \n* This allows Memvid to unify long-term memory and external information retrieval into a single system, enabling deeper, context-aware intelligence across sessions, without juggling multiple dependencies. \n* So when the agent receives a query, Memvid simply activates only the relevant frames, by meaning, keyword, time, or context, and reconstructs the answer instantly.\n* The result is a small, model-agnostic memory file your agent can carry anywhere.  \n\n**What this means for developers:**\n\nMemvid replaces your entire RAG stack.\n\n* Ingest any data type\n* Zero preprocessing required\n* Millisecond retrieval\n* Self-learning through interaction\n* Saves 20+ hours per week\n* Cut infrastructure costs by 90%\n\nJust plug Memvid into your agent and you instantly get a fully functional, persistent memory layer right out of the box.\n\n**Performance & Compatibility**\n\n(tested on my Mac M4)\n\n* Ingestion speed: 157 docs/sec \n* Search Latency: <17ms retrieval for 50,000 documents\n* Retrieval Accuracy: beating leading RAG pipelines by over 60%\n* Compression: up to 15× smaller storage footprint\n* Storage efficiency: store 50,000 docs in a \\~200 MB file\n\nMemvid works with every model and major framework: GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama, LangChain, Autogen and custom-built stacks. \n\nYou can also 1-click integrate with your favorite IDE (eg. VS Code, Cursor)\n\nIf your AI agent can read a file or call a function, it can now remember forever.\n\nAnd your memory is 100% portable: Build with GPT → run on Claude → move to Llama. The memory stays identical.\n\n**Bonus for builders**\n\nAlongside Memvid V2, we’re releasing 4 open-source tools, all built on top of Memvid:\n\n* **Memvid ADR** → is an MCP package that captures architectural decisions as they happen during development. When you make high-impact changes (e.g. switching databases, refactoring core services), the decision and its context are automatically recorded instead of getting lost in commit history or chat logs.\n   * GitHub Link: [https://github.com/memvid/adrflow](https://github.com/memvid/adrflow)\n* **Memvid Canvas** →  is a UI framework for building fully-functional AI applications on top of Memvid in minutes. Ship customer facing or internal enterprise agents with zero infra overhead.\n   * GitHub Link: [https://github.com/memvid/canvas](https://github.com/memvid/canvas)\n* **Memvid Mind** → is a persistent memory plugin for coding agents that captures your codebase, errors, and past interactions. Instead of starting from scratch each session, agents can reference your files, previous failures, and full project context, not just chat history. Everything you do during a coding session is automatically stored and ingested as relevant context in future sessions. \n   * GitHub Link: [https://github.com/memvid/memvid-mind](https://github.com/memvid/memvid-mind)\n* **Memvid CommitReel** → is a rewindable timeline for your codebase stored in a single portable file. Run any past moment in isolation, stream logs live, and pinpoint exactly when and why things broke.\n   * GitHub Link: [https://github.com/memvid/commitreel](https://github.com/memvid/commitreel)\n\nAll 100% open-source and available today.\n\nMemvid V2 is the version that finally feels like what AI memory should’ve been all along.\n\nIf any of this sounds useful for what you’re building, I’d love for you to try it and let me know how we can improve it.[](https://github.com/memvid/memvid)",

The thread is split right down the middle.\n\n**On one hand, the community is calling foul on the presentation.** The top-voted comments are slamming the post for being **clickbait** (it's an ad, not the promised story about going viral) and for being **untransparent about a 50MB free limit** that leads to a paywall. Many feel hiding the monetization is a \"scummy\" move.\n*   A few users are defending OP, noting it's a solo dev project and it's open-source, so you can just remove the limit yourself.\n*   There's also some grumbling that the post and OP's replies sound like AI-generated marketing copy.\n\n**On the other hand, the actual tech is getting a lot of love.** People are genuinely impressed with the idea of storing embeddings in video frames, especially since it seems to predate well-known projects like DeepSeek-OCR. The tech-heads are already digging into the code and discussing how to integrate it with other tools.\n\nOP clarifies the project is meant to be like **\"SQLite for AI memory\"**—a portable file for stateful agents, not a full-blown vector DB replacement.\n\nSo, the consensus: **Innovative tech and a potentially very useful tool, but the marketing and lack of transparency left a bad taste in everyone's mouth.**",
