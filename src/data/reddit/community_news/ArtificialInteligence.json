      "text": "OpenAI hit \"Code Red\" in December after Google's Gemini 3 started dominating benchmarks and user growth, forcing teams to drop everything and scramble to catch up.\n\nTraffic dipped month-over-month in late 2025 (second decline of the year), while Gemini surged to 650M+ monthly active users; even Salesforce's CEO publicly switched after a quick test.\n\nMicrosoft's filings show OpenAI lost \\~$12B in a single quarter; projections point to $143B cumulative losses before profitability — no startup has ever bled this much; Sora video gen alone costs $15M/day and is called \"completely unsustainable\" even internally.\n\nScaling laws are brutal now: 2x better models need 5x+ compute/energy/data centers; 2025 training runs reportedly failed to beat prior versions despite huge resources.\n\nHyped as making GPT-4 \"mildly embarrassing,\" but users called it underwhelming, worse at basics like math/geography, too robotic/safe/corporate; OpenAI rolled back to GPT-4o in \\~24 hours due to backlash, then dropped incremental .1/.2 updates with the same complaints.\n\nKey exits include: \n\nCTO Mira Murati, Chief Research Officer \n\nBob McGrew, Chief Scientist \n\nIlya Sutskever, President \n\nGreg Brockman, and half the AI safety team; some cited toxic leadership under Altman.\n\nSeeking up to $134B; federal judge ruled it heads to jury trial (set for early 2026), citing evidence OpenAI broke nonprofit promises Musk funded with $38M early on.\n\nNeeds \\~$200B annual revenue by 2030 (15x growth) amid exploding costs; Altman himself warned investors are overexcited and \"someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money.\"\n\nAI bubble peaking with competitors closing in, lawsuits mounting, and fundamentals ignored at $500B valuation; smart move might be exiting hype plays, trimming Mag7 AI bets, and rotating to undervalued small/mid-caps with real earnings.\n\nThoughts? Is this the start of the AI winter we've been warned about, or is it just growing pains for the leader? 🚀💥",

Since they don’t seem worried, at all, then it leads me to believe that they must be lying, especially about their timeline. AI isn’t coming for the majority of white collar jobs anytime soon. \n\nBig obstacles are heading at the industry, as OP mentioned. Then there’s the fact that people are quickly becoming aware that having an AI server farm in your city is not something you want. The noise alone is unbearable and physically disabling, which makes your property worthless and your health compromised. I guess that’s great for the farm, because they can then buy your property at pennies on the dollar, in order to expand their farm. Rinse and repeat. \n\nCan’t forget about the water supply they need and, industry being what it is, the pollution and environmental impact that will happen. \n\nEnergy usage/supply is another obstacle when they raise prices for everyone else. \n\nHopefully solutions to these issues can be discovered because I appreciate AI, for the most part, because it’s free.

          "text": "This thread is spicy for a reason, but it’s also mixing three very different things into one “OpenAI is doomed” narrative - tech limits, business math, and vibes. Let me poke at all three a bit.\n\nFirst, a lot of the numbers being thrown around might be directionally true but they’re being interpreted like OpenAI is a normal startup. It isn’t. This is closer to early AWS than WeWork. AWS lost money for years while Amazon lit cash on fire building infra no one else wanted to pay for yet. Same pattern here: OpenAI is front-loading the most expensive part of the curve (training + inference at scale) before enterprise pricing, regulation moats, and distribution fully kick in. That doesn’t mean it can’t fail - just that “losing $X per quarter” on its own isn’t a death sentence.\n\nSecond, the “Gemini is winning because it’s bundled” argument cuts both ways. Bundling wins short-term MAUs, not necessarily mindshare or platform gravity. Internet Explorer had the bundle. Chrome won the developers. Right now ChatGPT is still the verb. That matters more than Reddit wants to admit. If OpenAI turns that verb into workflows (agents, memory, internal tools, enterprise copilots), the revenue math changes fast. If they don’t, then yeah - BlackBerry comparisons start to feel earned.\n\nOn the exec exits: this is the strongest bearish signal IMO, but people are over-romanticizing it. Frontier labs are inherently unstable. The moment you shift from “pure research lab” to “global product + gov relationships + $10B infra decisions,” you will lose researchers who hate that world. That’s not automatically “rats fleeing,” it’s often “wrong personality for the phase.” The real red flag would be research stagnation plus talent drain plus declining usage. We don’t have all three yet.\n\nWhere I do agree with OP: scaling laws are getting ugly, and OpenAI is the most exposed because they set the pace. Being first means you pay the most tuition. Google can wait, copy, and amortize across Search, Ads, Android, and TPU. OpenAI doesn’t have that luxury. If on-device models reach “good enough” faster than expected, cloud-first players get squeezed hard.\n\nSo no, I don’t think this is an AI winter. The tech is too useful, and adoption is too real. But could OpenAI specifically end up being the company that proved it was possible, but not the one that captured the most value? Absolutely. History is full of those.\n\nThe real question isn’t “will OpenAI fail?”\nIt’s: will they become an infra layer, a product company, or an acquisition?\nBecause only one of those justifies the current narrative - and they’re running out of time to choose.",

If that doesn't scream \"we have no idea what we're doing anymore\" idk what does.\n\nAnd the executive exodus? When your CTO, Chief Research Officer, AND the guy who literally invented your core tech (Ilya) all leave within months... that's not \"normal turnover.\" That's rats leaving a sinking ship energy.\n\nHere's the thing people miss though: **OpenAI isn't really an AI company anymore. It's a hype machine that happens to have AI.** Sam's been doing more podcasts and congressional hearings than actual research. Meanwhile Anthropic and Google are just... shipping.\n\nThe $500B valuation at -$12B/quarter means they need to 15x revenue while compute costs are still exponential. The math doesn't math.\n\nNot saying \"AI winter\" yet — the tech is real — but OpenAI specifically might become the WeWork of this cycle. First mover advantage only works if you can actually sustain it.\n\n*grabs popcorn* 🍿",

Not “AI no longer works,” but “AI is becoming a problem of heavy engineering and brutal business,” not a magic hack.\n\n\nRegarding OpenAI in particular, I get the impression they're paying the price for:\n\n• their leading position (everyone compares them, no one forgives them),\n\n• and a complicated transition from research to consumer product to cash cow.\n\nThe feedback about them being \"too robotic/corporate\" is also interesting: technically, they're progressing, but in terms of user experience, there might be stagnation, or even regression. And benchmarks don't capture that.\n\n\nSo for me:\n\n• not an AI winter in the 2010 sense,\n\n• but probably the end of the \"free money + hype + naive scaling\" phase.\n\nThe question I'm asking myself is:\n\nWill the next wave of innovation come from new giant models, or from more refined, more human, better integrated—but less spectacular—uses?\n\nCurious to know what you think will be the next real differentiator: raw performance, cost, or user experience?",

Do they push harder for fast IPO and then bail … or do they wait until OAI funding dries up and they try and salvage and rebuild or integrate the leftovers.   One thing for certain shareholders will not be happy if MS simply continues to pour more money in to prop them up",

AWS bled for years too.\n\nThat said, the warning signs are not imaginary:\n-Costs are exploding faster than capabilities\n-Leadership churn + legal pressure is not nothing\n-Incremental model gains do feel underwhelming lately\n\nI don’t buy “biggest failure in history,” but I do buy that the hype curve ran ahead of the fundamentals. This does not feel like AI winter yet instead more like a reality check phase where easy gains are gone and only disciplined players survive.\n\nTL;DR: Not winter, but definitely the end of the free-money, infinite-upside era.

Open source collapses adoption costs in a way closed models simply can’t.\n\nWhat Chinese labs seem to be optimizing for is distribution and integration, not prestige benchmarks. If you get thousands of teams building internal tools on your model, you gain ecosystem gravity—even if you’re not “the best” on paper.\n\nOn the US side, the strategy makes sense too: closed models maximize margin, control, and regulatory defensibility. But that naturally pushes devs toward open alternatives for anything that’s not consumer-facing or highly sensitive.\n\nThis feels less like “China vs US” and more like a bifurcation by use case:\n\nClosed models for general-purpose consumer AI\n\nOpen models for developer tooling and production workflows\n\nThat split already exists in other tech domains. AI may just be catching up.\n\nCurious to hear from folks actually running GLM or DeepSeek in production—especially where customization or on-prem mattered more than raw capability.",

Businesses, IP, distribution, audiences, equity, whatever. AI makes them more productive, cuts their costs, and lets them scale way faster than before.\n\nOn the bottom arm: people who trade their time to solve problems. And here's the part nobody really wants to admit - AI is shrinking the number of problems that actually need a human to solve them.\n\nNot down to zero. But fewer. And way more competitive.\n\nRight now, you can still move between the two. You can still build a small SaaS, control a niche workflow, own an audience, create some kind of leverage instead of just trading hours for money.\n\nBut I don't think that window stays open forever.\n\nMy guess is that the next 5 years or so matter way more than people realize. After that, the gap hardens. Not because people get lazy or stop trying, but because AI drops the cost of execution to basically nothing, capital and distribution start to dominate everything, and asset owners just keep compounding while everyone else fights over scraps.\n\nThis isn't some doomer take. It's just economics 101.\n\nI'm not saying everyone needs to be a billionaire. But relying purely on selling your time feels riskier every year from here.\n\nI'm interested in how others are thinking about this. Is the K-shape inevitable? Or does AI actually reopen mobility long-term? And if you disagree, where do you think new value comes from for people who don't own assets?\n\nGenuinely want to hear counter-arguments.",

AI was trained on collective human output - decades of knowledge, creativity, labor - and now a handful of companies are capturing all the value from it. That's fundamentally broken, and some form of redistribution or collective ownership makes way more sense than pretending individual hustle will save people.\n\nWhere I get stuck is the same place I always do - I agree this is the right direction, but I don't see a clear path from here to there. The people who control the infrastructure and capital aren't going to redistribute it voluntarily, and I'm not sure what leverage the rest of us have to force it when labor becomes optional.\n\nNot saying we shouldn't fight for it, just that I don't know what that fight actually looks like in practice.

I have a masterclass in Animation, and if there is anything that Richard Williams taught me - is that it's vital to sometimes start from scratch in order to truly master your skills.\n\nThe trap with letting a \"model\" do all the basics, is that you can get the very foundation wrong, and it's very hard to catch this in the later process.\n\nBasic skills is essential, no matter how much aid you get, there's an old saying \"the Devil is in the details\", and it truly is.\n\nI was having a discussion with an old School Master Coder, one of those that knows code inside out, the back of his hand if you will, he said to me - I spent so much time correcting flawed code that it cost me more to correct this than what I earned on the code I got.\n\nAnd he is right - for the most part, the part that people (even skilled ones) miss, is to fully understand what an LLM and what it is not. It needs a lot of \"hand holding\", unless you scaffold and give it a proper framework, which means you need to keep a tight \"game plan\", a master plan for your project, follow it like a military drill, don't vibe to much and don't deviate from the framework too much, you can always add \"modules\" later on, as long as your framework holds up (kinda like a house with good foundation), you'll be fine.\n\nJuniors will desperately be needed, I know - because I've hired them myself in our company, and they ALWAYS have to learn the basics properly and not \"cheat\" too much, if you cheat too much (even if you get away with it) and have NO clue what you're doing, then we're screwed!",

Staying invested in the companies that win the transition is probably the safest play for people who already have assets.\n\nThe college thing is interesting too. I hadn’t thought about it as gatekeeping, but you’re right - if access tightens and it becomes a signaling mechanism again instead of just a checkbox, then it might actually regain value. Especially if the “thinker class” becomes more insulated from automation than everyone else.\n\nI’ll check out that book - sounds like exactly the kind of perspective that’s useful right now. The people who navigate these transitions well aren’t usually the ones predicting doom or euphoria, they’re the ones just making smart, boring decisions and protecting what they have.\n\nAppreciate you sharing this. It’s a more grounded version of the same concern, and probably the right playbook if you’re already on the right side of the divide.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

That's not \"thinking\" the way we do, but it's also not just autocomplete. It's somewhere in between - not sentient, but functionally useful in ways that matter.\n\nWhere I think you're right is that embodied tasks like robotics might actually be where this gets more reliable, because the constraints are clearer and the feedback loops are tighter. Knowledge work is messy and harder to validate.\n\nBut even if AI doesn't hit AGI or stalls out at \"pretty good automation,\" I think the economic impact still happens. You don't need full intelligence to displace jobs or shift leverage toward capital. Just \"good enough\" might be enough to tilt things.\n\nSo yeah, could be a bubble.

AI executes instructions inside constraints humans define. That’s not asset-ownership magic, that’s just tooling.\n\nEvery productivity revolution has followed this same pattern. Spreadsheets didn’t eliminate accountants, they raised expectations. CAD didn’t eliminate engineers, it raised complexity. Automation didn’t eliminate manufacturing work, it shifted skill demand. AI is the same thing, just louder.\n\nThe whole “bottom arm” framing assumes value only comes from ownership, that labor is static, and that demand is fixed. None of that is true.\n\nWhen execution gets cheaper, people don’t want less. They want more. More customization, more speed, more integration, more compliance, more interpretation, more handling of edge cases. That creates new problems faster than old ones disappear, and those problems still require humans.\n\nThe idea that capital and distribution will dominate everything also ignores reality. Distribution itself is getting commoditized. Attention fragments faster than capital compounds. Trust, judgment, taste, accountability, and context do not scale infinitely.\n\nOwning assets has always compounded better than selling time. That’s not AI. That’s been true for thousands of years.\n\nWhat is new is that the cost of building leverage is lower than ever. Barriers to entry for ownership keep dropping. One person can now do what used to require teams. That’s not a closing window. That’s a widening one.\n\nThis isn’t economics 101. It’s vibes, LinkedIn fear, and a misunderstanding of how tools change labor markets.\n\nAI doesn’t replace people who solve problems. It replaces people who only execute without judgment.\n\nIf you think selling time is dead, you’ve never met a good nurse, a good mechanic, a good operator, a good salesperson, or a good manager.\n\nAI didn’t end leverage. It just raised the bar on what counts as valuable work.",

That power isn’t the same as being rich, but it’s also not nothing.\n\nI don’t think most people end up permanently unemployed overnight. It’s more likely a long grind where roles keep getting hollowed out unless you move closer to leverage, coordination, or control. Bleak, yeah - but not a single snap into two static classes either.\n\nThe danger isn’t automation itself. It’s whether access to leverage stays fluid… or freezes. That part isn’t inevitable yet.",

All the hard problems are going to require hardware resources exceeding the reach of most of us. That's not to say I won't \\*try\\*, but I find anything smaller than a 30B parameter model makes way too many category errors and ends up chasing its own tail way too often. I can run 30B models, and some of them are actually pretty good although a lot of them still suffer from coherence issues. It's just that I can only offload about 40% of said model to the GPU, and although they can start out at a reasonable speed (like 8 tokens per second) they very quickly slow down as the context window fills up—and that's with a fairly small context window like 40960 tokens.\n\nThis makes them fun to just chat with, and they make decent writing assistants, but the problem of context limits the functionality in the latter role. I've tried 4B, 8B, and 14B models and they're just not smart enough to do the job. I've also tried 70B models (very slowly) and found some of \\*them\\* are kinda stupid too, so I think I've found a sweet spot with `Qwen3-30B-A3B-abliterated-erotic.i1-Q4_K_M`from mradermacher. It's still not sweet enough, but it's probably the best I'm going to manage without essentially building a whole new rig around a very expensive video card and loading it up with a ton of (also very expensive) DDR5 RAM.\n\nHonestly I'm pretty impressed at what I can do with an RTX 3060, an i5-8500, and 48 GB of DDR4.

Unless you are a billionaire at this point, you are screwed.\n\n> On the top arm: people who own stuff. Businesses, IP, distribution, audiences, equity, whatever. AI makes them more productive, cuts their costs, and lets them scale way faster than before.\n\n> On the bottom arm: people who trade their time to solve problems. And here's the part nobody really wants to admit - AI is shrinking the number of problems that actually need a human to solve them.\n\nMost \"top arm\" people are not as safe as you believe. Most of them rely on the \"bottom arm\" people for generating revenue. Very few of them can exist in a demand-vacuum (which is the race-to-the-bottom scenario of layoffs and efficiency increases you are talking about), and they will be forced to exit as the economy (or what is left of it anyway) turns into a heap of supply no one can afford. Again, some companies will be able to survive, although with considerably less total revenue, but most will go under.\n\n> Right now, you can still move between the two. You can still build a small SaaS, control a niche workflow, own an audience, create some kind of leverage instead of just trading hours for money.\n\nNo, you can't. You have deluded yourself into thinking you can, though. If the barrier to entry becomes effectively zero with AI it means two things: (1) anyone can do it, so expect 10000 Indians doing the same thing you are doing, undercutting you indefinitely and (2) companies and customers will be able to do any and all SaaS products in-house, meaning the SaaS you are building is living on borrowed time. You might be able to suck a few years out of it, but it's never going anywhere because the AI-tools you are leveraging to build whatever service can be done by anyone else.\n\n> My guess is that the next 5 years or so matter way more than people realize. After that, the gap hardens. Not because people get lazy or stop trying, but because AI drops the cost of execution to basically nothing, capital and distribution start to dominate everything, and asset owners just keep compounding while everyone else fights over scraps.\n\nTrue, and good luck outbidding Google, Meta or Amazon for hosting your SaaS. What happens when these companies effectively monopolize the hosting infrastructure through outpricing every independent actor? You will fight over scraps, indeed. But these will be scraps of food, not some imaginary market share. We are heading into dystopia where like 5 companies will own and host all of the worlds software, and you will be unable to outcompete them in any way as they have more capital than you can even imagine.\n\n> I'm not saying everyone needs to be a billionaire. But relying purely on selling your time feels riskier every year from here.\n\nUnless you directly own a considerable amount of AI infrastructure (see datacenters, not some fucking PC in a basement somewhere), directly work with development of AI in some way that cannot be done by AI itself, power AI (electricity field) or extract resources used for AI and robotics then you are fucked.\n\n> Or does AI actually reopen mobility long-term?\n\nNo, AI is the re-feudalization and permanent stratification of the social classes. You will either be a have or a have-not, and your children (assuming we are not killed off) will suffer the same fate. A SaaS will not rescue you from that fate. There are a lot of people on reddit (/r/accelerate & /r/singularity) that are actually excited about this, believe it or not! I would imagine most of these people being billionaires, based on how much they are looking forward to it!\n\n> And if you disagree, where do you think new value comes from for people who don't own assets?\n\nSkills directly related to the survival of you, your family and community. Growing, storing and preparing food. Healthcare.\n\nAlso this entire post is likely AI-generated, maybe in some diffuse effort of advertising the SaaS that this 1 month old account is apparently building. Not subtle.",

Could be full re-feudalization.

But \"most\" isn't \"all.\" There are still niches where trust, taste, or deep context matter enough that you can't just get undercut by a thousand clones. Not saying it's easy, just that it's not literally impossible.\n\nAs for the mega-corps owning all the infrastructure - probably true long-term, but we're not there yet.

This is capitalist ideology accepting exploitation as inevitable, not \"economics 101\".\n\n\"Asset owners\" vs \"people who trade time\" is just bourgeoisie vs proletariat with extra steps. The \"K-shape\" isn't new - it's how capitalism has always functioned. Capital accumulates, labour gets squeezed.\n\nAI doesn't change this dynamic - it intensifies it. Automation under capitalism means workers lose bargaining power and face unemployment, while capitalists extract more value with fewer workers. That's not a tech problem, **it's a class problem**.\n\nThe \"solution\" you're proposing - scramble to become a small asset owner before the window closes - is individualist fantasy. Most people can't build SaaS or \"own audiences.\" And even if they could, you're just proposing everyone become small-scale capitalists. That doesn't solve exploitation, it just moves you to the other side of it.\n\n**Here's the actual answer:** automation should liberate workers from toil. \n\nUnder socialism, AI means shorter workweeks and shared prosperity. \nUnder capitalism, it means unemployment and concentration of wealth.\n\nThe \"mobility\" you want doesn't come from individual escape. It comes from collective organisation - unions, tenant movements, socialist politics - that fights for workers to control the fruits of automation instead of letting capitalists hoard them.\n\nYou can't individually escape a class system.

You're right that it just moves you to the other side of the exploitation without fixing the system.\n\nWhere I get stuck is on the collective transformation part. I *want* to believe that unions, tenant movements, and socialist organizing can actually redistribute the gains from automation. But I'm genuinely uncertain whether labor has enough leverage left to force that when capital doesn't need workers anymore. Like historically, labor won concessions because strikes could halt production. What happens when production doesn't need labor?\n\nI'm not saying that means we give up on collective action - maybe it just means the fight has to look different. But I also don't know what that looks like in practice, and in the meantime people still have to survive.\n\nSo maybe the individual scramble is a dead-end, but I don't yet see the collective path clearly enough to tell people \"just organize and it'll work out.\" Not saying you're wrong, just that I'm stuck between knowing the system's broken and not seeing a clear route to fixing it before it locks in.\n\nAppreciate you laying this out clearly though.

If workers are unemployed, demand collapses. That's why even capitalists are floating UBI - they need markets.\n* Infrastructure workers - someone maintains the grid, builds the datacenters, delivers the packages. Automation displaces some labor, not all.\n* Social reproduction - care work, childcare, healthcare. These resist automation and remain essential.\n* The idea that 'automation will open up new job opportunities' is flawed when viewed as a solution to this problem, but it is a real thing too - there will be new jobs created to support automation (fewer, of course, than the jobs replaced by automation), engineers to install and repair the machines and so on. They still fundamentally rely on labour - no matter how much automation happens, somewhere down the line it comes down to a human's muscle and brainpower to make that happen **and the ongoing efforts of both to some degree.**\n\nLabour’s leverage shifts, but doesn't disappear. It becomes about controlling the infrastructure rather than just withholding production.\n\n**What organising looks like:**\n\n* Tenant unions fighting rent increases and demanding social housing - capital needs tenants, even if it doesn't need factory workers\n* Utility nationalisation campaigns - demand public ownership of AI infrastructure, energy grids, broadband\n* Universal basic services not UBI - free healthcare, transport, housing. Make survival independent of employment.\n* Worker control of automation - demands that displaced workers retrain into maintaining/controlling automated systems, not just get fired\n\nThe fight shifts from \"withhold labour to halt production\" to \"demand control over the systems capital created.\" Strike action still works where labour exists. Where it doesn't, it's about democratic control of automated production - who decides what gets made and who benefits?\n\n**On survival vs. transformation:**\n\nYou're right that people need to survive now. I'm not saying don't take the gig, don't learn the skill, don't try to improve your position. Survival strategies and collective organising aren't mutually exclusive - you can do both.\n\nWhat I'm saying is: don't mistake survival tactics for solutions. The individual scramble won't save most people, but it might buy time. Use that time to organise.\n\nThe path forward isn't perfectly clear - it never is before you walk it. But history shows: when workers organise around shared interests, they win concessions even from hostile systems. The specifics adapt to conditions. Right now, that means organising tenants, demanding public ownership of infrastructure, and building mutual aid networks.\n\nIt won't \"work out\" automatically. But collective action is the only thing that ever has worked. Individual escape is a lottery ticket.",

          "text": "I get why so many people are worried about AI creating a K-shaped economy, where a few asset owners win big and everyone else struggles. It’s a valid concern, and it’s easy to see how we could end up there if we’re not careful. But I’m not totally convinced that’s the only possible future. Here’s why I think there’s still hope for a different outcome.\n\nFor starters, AI isn’t just a tool for the wealthy or well-connected. It’s actually making it easier for regular people to create value without needing a ton of resources upfront. You don’t have to be a tech billionaire to use AI to build something, automate tasks, or even start a side hustle. The game isn’t rigged yet, it’s just changing fast, and those who adapt early might find themselves in a stronger position than they think.\n\nThen there’s the fact that AI isn’t great at everything. It can crunch numbers and generate content, but it can’t replace human creativity, judgment, or emotional intelligence. As AI takes over repetitive tasks, the things that make us uniquely human could become even more valuable. Maybe the future isn’t about owning assets versus selling time, but about finding smarter ways to combine the two.\n\nI also think we’re underestimating how AI could open up new opportunities. The internet already showed us that niche markets can be incredibly lucrative. AI might just make it easier to tap into those niches, whether you’re offering a specialized service, creating digital products, or building a community around a shared interest.\n\nAnd let’s be honest: the future isn’t set in stone. The way we design policies, share access to tools, and support innovation will play a huge role in how this all plays out. If we focus on making AI work for everyone, not just a select few, we might end up with a much more balanced economy than we’re fearing.\n\nSo, is the K-shape inevitable? I don’t think so. But it’s on us to make sure we’re building a future that works for as many people as possible. What’s your take, are we heading for a divide, or is there a path to something better?",

The optimistic case you're laying out isn't unrealistic.\n\nWhere I'm less convinced is on timing and scale. You're right that AI makes it easier to build stuff without huge upfront resources, but it also makes it easier for everyone else to do the same thing. So the question becomes: does lowering barriers create more opportunity, or does it just flood every niche with competition until margins collapse? I think it depends on how fast capabilities improve versus how fast new value gets discovered.\n\nOn the human skills thing - creativity, judgment, emotional intelligence - I agree those matter. I'm just not sure they'll command the same premium they used to. Being \"uniquely human\" might still be necessary, but if it's not scarce anymore because AI handles everything around it, does it actually pay well? Or does it just become table stakes?\n\nI want to believe policy and access can steer this toward a balanced outcome. But I'm skeptical that happens without serious pressure, because the incentives all point toward centralization. The people with capital and infrastructure don't give it up voluntarily.\n\nSo yeah, the K-shape isn't inevitable. But I think avoiding it requires intentional intervention, not just optimism that the tools will spread themselves evenly. Hope you're right though.",

The K-shape discourse is very \"what happens to software engineers\" and less \"what happens to the guy who's been delivering DoorDash since 2020 because nothing else worked out.\"\n\nAI could make the K worse by displacing the currently-employed into that pool. Or it could do the opposite - lower barriers to participation, enable new forms of work, let more people create value than the old system allowed.\n\nWhich one happens isn't economics 101. It's a policy choice. The K-shape is the default if nobody intervenes, but it's not the only possible outcome.\n\nThat said, I'm not exactly optimistic about which path we're currently on. We're speedrunning the bad ending and calling it innovation. But I've been wrong before. Usually about things that matter less than this, unfortunately.",

          "text": "The original post says you need to own businesses or assets to survive. That's not really true. You just need to find ways to work with AI so it makes you better at your job instead of replacing you.\n\nHere are three ways to do that:\n\nFirst, build expertise in areas where AI can't help much. AI knows a lot of general information. But it doesn't know the details about your town, your community, or your specific industry. You can become an expert in something very specific. Maybe you learn everything about the rules in your field. Maybe you understand your local culture better than anyone else. Maybe you know exactly what a small group of customers needs. AI can't copy this kind of knowledge. You become more valuable because AI handles the easy stuff and you handle the hard, specific stuff.\n\nSecond, work in jobs where people need other people. Some jobs exist because humans want to connect with other humans. Jobs like teaching, coaching, therapy, entertainment, and community leadership all depend on human connection. People want more than just answers to their problems. They want trust. They want someone who gets them. AI might help you do parts of these jobs faster. But it can't replace you because being human is the whole point. When everything else gets automated, the human touch might actually become more special.\n\nThird, get really good at using AI tools. Think of a conductor leading an orchestra. The conductor doesn't play the instruments. But the conductor knows how to bring everyone together to make beautiful music. You can do the same thing with AI. Learn how to use different AI tools together in smart ways. You become the person who knows how to make AI work for you. The AI is your helper, not your replacement.\n\nThe real question isn't \"do you own assets?\" The real question is \"are you learning skills that matter more when AI does the boring work?\"\n\nYou don't need to rush out and buy a business in the next five years. You need to figure out how to work with AI instead of against it. Find work where being human matters. Build knowledge that's special to you. Use AI as your assistant. That's how you stay valuable.",

For ancient humans when they were born there was no property system so they used the land where they were born.  If someone fenced done area to do something it would be temporary not inherited a d had to be defended.\nThe point is that people were born with access to territory.\nWith agriculture and later property records and laws,\nyou could acquire land and remove it from the common pool.  The common pool was never protected, so overtime we reach today were a person it born with nothing because everything was taken by the people born before.\nSo, what look natural now, you need to earn what you have ( except if you inherited) is not as natural as it seems,  and it even looks unfair: you are born in an age where everything was taken from you, all was divided and assigned to someone else, and here you come as a defenseless new being and you have nothing",

Like, AlphaFold didn't just predict words, it solved protein folding in ways that advanced biology by years. Noyron's aerospike engine design - something NASA couldn't crack in 70 years - wasn't just autocomplete, it was genuine discovery.\n\nThese systems are finding patterns and solutions humans missed, even if the mechanism is probabilistic. That's not AGI, sure, but it's also not Teddy Ruxpin. It's somewhere in between - not sentient, but functionally useful in ways that go beyond summarization and email drafts.\n\nAnd yeah, the bubble might burst, OpenAI might collapse, the economics are broken right now. But even if that happens, the capabilities don't vanish. Open models keep improving, costs keep dropping, and the tools stick around even if the hype dies.\n\nAlso worth remembering - this is the *worst* AI will ever be from here. Even if progress slows, we're not going backward. So whether it's overhyped or not, the impact is real and probably growing.\n\nNot saying you're wrong to be skeptical, just that I think there's more signal here than just next-token prediction and marketing noise.",

Then not just electricity production, but transmission needs to be 3 or 4 times multiplied also, and that takes even longer. \n\nAfter you solve the energy problem, our current iteration of \"AI\" is almost never likely to attain AGI, let alone ASI. Many major players in the industry admit as much regularly. There are major structural hurdles to solve and probably a dozen steps along the way that will all require miraculous breakthroughs that each one alone could take decades, or may not even actually be possible at all (we don't know, we don't even have the energy AVAILABLE yet) many of these breakthroughs would require an entire full re think of the AI system we currently have, or a major breakthrough with fusion technology or the largest traditional nuclear plant build out in human history, times 10.\n\nAfter that, robotics needs to miraculously get about 100x better than it currently is. Even the latest generations of teslas robots still can't actively do probably 95% of human jobs aside from the most basic tasks (oh yeah, and these robots also run on electricity too, need more of that again I guess)\n\nAnd all of this assumes this massive investment boom in AI holds, permanently, for decades and decades without ever letting up. Investors typically aren't that patient. \n\nI agree that it's highly likely we will eventually automate away most jobs and have a major structural change, but this fantasy that there somehow won't be any more major hurdles or bumps along the road is naive.

AI is just one input, not the whole economy.\n\nI think where some of the tension comes from is tech folks extrapolating from software-heavy sectors and forgetting that atoms don’t move like bits. A restaurant, a factory, a logistics company - you can augment those with AI, but you’re not replacing the humans any time soon.\n\nSo yeah, agreed: AI matters, but it’s not eating the entire economy. For most real businesses, it’s a tool that nudges margins or productivity, not some magic switch that replaces people wholesale.",

                  "text": "I think this is where the argument goes off the rails, because it treats “AI” as some monolithic replacement force rather than as a tool embedded in real organizations, real workflows, and real constraints. Jobs are not abstract bundles of tasks waiting to be vaporized. They are mixtures of judgment, context, trust, accountability, domain knowledge, and coordination with other humans. AI is very good at accelerating parts of that work, but it does not magically assume responsibility for outcomes, own ambiguity, or navigate messy organizational reality. That is why, historically, automation has replaced tasks far faster than it replaces roles, and why productivity gaps show up between people doing the same job rather than whole professions disappearing overnight.\n\nWhat actually happens in practice is selection pressure. When two people hold the same role, the one who uses AI to think better, draft faster, analyze deeper, and iterate more quickly becomes more valuable to the organization. The other person is not replaced by a machine. They are replaced by a human who learned to use new tools effectively. This is not a slogan. It is exactly what happened with spreadsheets, search engines, IDEs, statistical software, and every general purpose productivity technology before AI. The firm still needs someone accountable for decisions, tradeoffs, ethics, and results. AI does not show up in the org chart and take the blame when something goes wrong.\n\nThe “everyone will be replaced no matter what” framing also ignores adoption reality. Organizations do not instantly refactor themselves around frontier models. They move slowly, unevenly, and conservatively. They worry about liability, data leakage, explainability, and governance. In that environment, people who understand both the domain and how to safely use AI gain leverage, not obsolescence. The skill shift is real, but it favors humans who adapt rather than humans who opt out and wait for replacement to arrive.\n\nIf AI truly replaced humans outright, firms would already be removing middle layers of decision making at scale. Instead, what we see is AI augmenting analysts, engineers, lawyers, doctors, product managers, and consultants while increasing expectations for output and quality. The bar rises. The number of people who can clear it changes. That is a very different dynamic from blanket replacement, and pretending otherwise is more comforting than accurate.",

                  "text": "I don’t think this holds up when you look at how automation has actually played out over the last 150 years. We’ve heard versions of this exact argument over and over again. Mechanized agriculture was supposed to wipe out work. Electrification was supposed to wipe out work. Assembly lines, mainframes, PCs, spreadsheets, the internet, and cloud computing were all supposed to wipe out work within a decade. None of that happened. What happened instead was that specific tasks got automated, productivity went up, roles changed, and entirely new kinds of jobs emerged around the new leverage.\n\nI always come back to agriculture because it’s so clear. In 1900, roughly 40 percent of Americans worked on farms. Today it’s under 2 percent, yet we don’t have 38 percent permanent unemployment. We have manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, services, engineering, software, and knowledge work that didn’t exist at scale before. The jobs didn’t vanish overnight. They shifted over decades as tools amplified what humans could do.\n\nThe same pattern keeps repeating. Automation doesn’t replace people wholesale, it replaces chunks of work. That raises the bar for what a role delivers. The people who adapt and use the tools well become more valuable. The people who refuse to adapt get squeezed out, not by machines, but by other humans who learned to use the machines. That’s exactly what we’re seeing with AI right now. The people quietly using it are not being replaced, they’re outperforming peers.\n\nI also think the “five years” claim ignores how organizations actually behave. Companies don’t instantly rewire themselves around new tech. They move slowly, unevenly, and cautiously because of risk, liability, regulation, and accountability. During that long transition, humans who understand the domain and can use AI safely and effectively gain leverage. AI doesn’t take responsibility, explain itself in a boardroom, or own the consequences when something goes wrong. Humans still do.\n\nThere will be disruption and there will be pain, just like every previous wave of automation. There is often a lag where skills don’t line up perfectly with new roles. But the idea that most jobs vanish and only juniors and elite experts survive is not what history shows. The middle doesn’t disappear. It evolves. And the consistent lesson is the same one we’re seeing now. People aren’t replaced by AI. They’re replaced by other people who learn how to use it.",

                  "text": "I don’t think this claim holds up at all, and it’s mostly because it assumes a speed, completeness, and organizational willingness that history simply does not support. People keep saying “a handful of years” as if firms routinely replace entire roles end to end once a tool gets good enough. That has basically never happened at scale. What actually happens is long, messy partial automation where humans stay in the loop far longer than predicted because real work is full of edge cases, accountability, coordination, and trust that organizations are not willing to hand over to software.\n\nEvery prior wave of automation was also described as “it’s already started” and “this time is different.” Mainframes were supposed to eliminate accountants and planners. Spreadsheets were supposed to eliminate analysts. Expert systems were supposed to eliminate professionals. None of that happened cleanly or quickly. What happened instead was that output expectations went up and the humans who understood the tools stayed employed while others fell behind. The timeline was decades, not a few years.\n\nThis argument also ignores how risk averse organizations actually are. Even when AI can technically do something, companies still worry about liability, regulation, auditability, explainability, and blame. When something goes wrong, the question is not “what did the model do,” it’s “who approved this and who is accountable.” That alone keeps humans in the loop far longer than the doom narrative admits. Firms do not rush to fully automate responsibility away.\n\nMost importantly, jobs are not static bundles waiting to be deleted. As tools improve, roles expand and change. The person using AI today does not get replaced tomorrow. Their scope increases. They manage more complexity, make higher level decisions, and own outcomes across a wider surface area. That is exactly what has happened repeatedly across history. Replacement happens at the task level, not the human level, and the humans who adapt keep moving up the value chain.\n\nSo when someone says “AI replaces them completely in a handful of years,” what they are really doing is projecting a clean technical curve onto a very dirty human system. History shows that projection is wrong every single time. What replaces people is not AI. It is other people who keep learning, keep adapting, and keep taking on more responsibility as the tools change.",

Using AI does not add a brand new burden of verification out of nowhere. It shifts where my effort goes. Instead of starting from a blank page, hunting for structure, or grinding through first drafts, I am reviewing, refining, and validating. That is a very different cognitive load, and it is almost always faster.\n\nThe “just do it myself” argument only holds if AI output and human output require the same level of review. They do not. AI is fantastic at first passes, summaries, scaffolding, comparisons, and surfacing things I might miss. Yes, I still sanity check facts, but I would do that with a junior analyst, a coworker, or even my own rushed work. The pizza glue example is a failure of judgment, not a failure of the tool. Someone blindly copying anything into production without review is already doing their job badly.\n\nWhere this really breaks down is scale. If I can produce ten decent drafts, analyses, or options in the time it used to take me to produce one, even with verification baked in, I win. The people who learn how to ask good questions, apply domain knowledge, and review intelligently are going to run circles around people who insist on doing everything manually out of principle. That is exactly how every previous productivity tool worked, from spreadsheets to search engines to IDEs. The work did not disappear, but the expectations shifted, and the people who adapted pulled ahead fast.",

I didn’t have to sort through spam or videos with accents I have trouble understanding. I learned and practiced three new methods in a span of 15 minutes.\n\nBefore that would have been 3 searches for videos or documentation, an hour of watching and reading and then another half hour attempting what I learned and bouncing back between material.\n\nThere’s a lot of thought going on (in my opinion of course), I’ve learned something much faster than under normal conditions.\n\nI really think it truly is how you use it.

By hiding the AI, you arbitrage the difference. You output senior-level work (High Value) with junior-level effort (Low Cost) and pocket the surplus.\n> \n> The Rule: Maintain the asymmetry. If you reveal the tool, you reveal that your labor cost is near zero, and your value drops to match it. Keep the black box closed.",

You cant pay forever, and you shouldn't \n\nAnd there is the answer to the \"will AI replace us\" question. If you really think AI can do everything you do, you're mediocre at your job, and AI WILL replace you most certainly. (Except lower paying jobs, those are always in danger of most automation)\n\nBut if your job is more than just doing the same shit, copy and pasting code and prompting all day. Sure as hell you wont be replaced, and if they replace you, the company will feel side effects\n\nThey have been saying ever since gpt 2.5 came around that \"in six months no one will ever need to code\". Yet 3 years have passed, and most of the people who work in tech did not get laid off for AI (there are exceptions ofc)\n\nNo, AI isnt your overlord, nor your girlfriend or boyfriend, not an assistant or copilot. Its a TOOL. And a tool NEEDS to be used by someone capable of thinking beyond what an AI can\n\nStop feeding into this bubble of expectations and promises of greedy companies, stop trying to tell someone else to do your job, even if they're not human.

Saying the loud silence. AI won't do that a human who watches and modifies and fine tunes do that.\n\nYou want to do some 1000 line shit automate it on excel with help of Copilot.\n\nDon't dump it on GPT chat bot and waste tokens an energy and keep prompting it back and forth for some dumb analysis using LLM. \n\nUse the AI tool for the job. Do not lose critical thinking. Force your mind to think and maintain connections mentally, force your mind to make correlation, force your mid to remember stuff and knowledge.\n\nFew time in a period of time work disconnected from online from your own notes only, no LLM, no search, no internet. Force yourself to build bigger memory and mental connections.\n\nAlso even during researching reading Actively thinking when response received from LLM, think what it's correlating ask the LLM, but force your mind to think deeper. For people like that LLM is an absolute best tool.\n\nLet me say I still sometimes open typing tutor program and try to keep up my speed and improve it. \n\nI am just 30 yrs old now but I started in tech like very early start in teens been coding since 12.\n\nEven in places I don't know, even in work trips overseas I have walked long distances mind mapping. Forcing yourself to not just depend on Google maps always.\n\nSimilarly I still read some books, I know I can synthesize it better with gpt but cover to cover reading gives a difference in confidence and raw ability.\n\nYou have to use AI, but actively using it knowing and understanding every line it outputs and thinking on it, to expand it further mind bursting with ideas 💡 is lot different from a person prompting and praying and accepting whatever it says without evaluating it mentally through own conscience and own knowledge.\n\nIf you just take the answer the AI gives you without analyzing it means ai is copying the 16 years old answer from Stack Overflow and pasting into your source code without understanding the context where it was asked, and absolute gold excellence in comments beneath the answers which gives you inner gotchas in code and make you evaluate between answers for the same problem. Also you see the newer answers, if you blindly trust AI it just takes the most voted answer blindly.\n\nWith Ai giving sources it's good, without sources it's bit more difficult. Also for anyone reading this Stack Overflow has AI now to guide you to the answer better but along with context and stuff.\n\nUse LLM, Machine Learning, Mapping, etc without losing critical thinking and also other skills like typing. Not always but keep it like practiced and well oiled your skills. Don't lose critical thinking and make your skills rusty.",

We love debates, but to me looks like LLM is really taking over.\n\nA friend mine, showed me a thread last week...  \nA guy running a Mac Mini M4 with whisper.cpp. He was spending thousands monthly on Google Cloud transcription. The Mac paid for itself in 20 days. he was not a DevOps engineer. He simply asked Claude how to set it up, followed the instructions, now runs production workloads from his desk.\n\nSame thread had a story that stuck with me. Non-technical guy at a manufacturing company...  \nNot IT, not a developer, just some guy. Their IT department had been stuck on a data migration for months. He just... did it. ChatGPT. 2 days. Management noticed. IT spent Christmas catching up while he was probably on a beach somewhere.\n\n$599 hardware. $200/month subscription. $799 total barrier to entry.\n\nThe threat was never the AI companies. The threat is the guy who figured out how to use them before you did.\n\n>I wrote up everything I'm seeing — the economics, the three classes forming, what this means for the next 5 years: [\\[full breakdown\\]](https://webmatrices.com/post/ai-won-t-take-your-job-a-guy-with-a-599-mac-mini-and-claude-will)\n\nWe keep having the wrong conversation. \"Will AI take jobs\" vs \"Who's already taking them with AI right now.\"",

On one hand, I'm thrilled that I was able to finally accomplish a number of goals within a few weeks that I've been waiting for somebody to help me with for years at my job, but on the other hand, I really have no idea how the code functions. I just know it works. If something were to go wrong with it, I could only go back to Claude and ask it to help me fix the problem. That's fine in a small company with one employee doing this sort of thing, but in a midsized or even a large company, having everybody able to write and release their own individual pieces of software could create a serious security problem or data loss.",

They're going to make me more productive with certain types of problems, period. Not like \"build a billion dollar company in a day\", but like, \"move something like 3 or 4% faster on average\". The more often this happens, the more significant it is and the more important it is to stay up to date.\n\nThe one thing these tools are NOT solving, and which remains imperative to understand, is what work you *should* do in the first place. I think these tools enable some people to do a ton of neat stuff, but it's not clear that it's worth doing in the first place. You know? It's great to learn of course, and great to have fun with these tools, but in a working context people do seem to be enabled to crank out shit loads of garbage and they have few opportunities to ask if it's necessary or helpful.",

Not 100% perfectly 100% of the time, but even debugging logs and patching the code is significantly faster than even a human SWE would be.\n\n\nI can translate full books/guides I've written (in minutes, with over 90% accuracy) in one of four languages in two clicks of a button via a choice of APIs, transcribe hour long podcasts in minutes using ElevenLabs Scribe 2.0, or locally via Whisper, generate a print PDF or ePub in a click of a button, etc.\n\n\nThe codebase is 10k+ lines long, extremely modular, and fully documented. Far from perfect of course (I don't think CustomTkinter is the most efficient GUI library to use),  but it's blowing my mind that, for £600 upfront, I've got a year's access to the equivalent of two full-time junior programmers that will get the job done. I'm not sure you'd even get that from a remote programmer (could be wrong though).\n\n\nEven yesterday, for shits and giggles, I had 5.2 codex knock up a .MP4/.webm to .gif converter (adding my own text and changing FPS/resolution) and it had a fully working MVP with GUI in under 10 minutes.\n\n\nAI is just a tool, which means that whenever the right person, understands how to use it the right way, at the right time, and for the right reasons, it'll do amazing things.\n\n\nIt's just unfortunate loads of companies are trying to shoehorn it into everything without understanding the inherent limitations.",

But power and control, by its nature, involves other people, society. Tech oligarchs or other billionaires aren’t interested in having only the, say, 100, or 1000, richest people survive.

It was said that the top 10% of earners are responsible for 50% of consumption, but to be a 10% earner you \"\"\"only\"\"\" need to earn like $200 000 yearly in the US. Many of these people are just normal people that have high paying jobs (think doctors, lawyers, engineers, etc.). Additionally, I would imagine (although I do not know for sure) that this 10% is very bottom heavy, i.e. its likely that the 10% of that 10% (i.e. the 1%) spend (proportionally) considerably less than the remaining 90%. There is a limit to how much you can really consume, and the ultra wealthy (so 1% and above) seem to always just store or hoard their wealth instead of going on consumer sprees.\n\nAll this to say that the majority of that 10% that do 50% of consumer spending will be very hurt by AI replacement. They are not billionaires a la Zuckerberg, building bunkers and compounds to shield themselves from the masses. They are normal people with well-paying careers that are just as susceptible to replacement as you and me.",

It doesn't pay rent, doesn't need food or water, doesn't need a car, doesn't need daycare, doesn't need heat, doesn't need to get its car fixed or house fixed, and doesn't even have a mortgage. The \"money\" that \"AI\" has is the money that its company has. Sure, a company might instruct some AI system to \"Buy X and Y services from so-and-so company,\" but this is just shuffling money between companies. Eventually, that flow of money will concentrate itself to basically a handful of ever-increasingly tyrannical companies (think Google, Meta, Nvidia, and maybe some resource extraction and electricity companies). The economy will literally shrink as consumers gradually disappear from the market until only the few I mentioned are left.

Except this time it will be far more extreme.\n\nThe new techno-feudal peasants will exist in a separate economy where they trade basic goods and services just to survive, because they will not be able to afford the things that tech elites effectively own and control. The elites will live as if nothing ever happened, probably even better than now, while everyone else struggles in increasingly harsh conditions.\n\nThat likely leads to mass starvation due to resource constraints, and the overall economy will degrade.

It was said that the top 10% of earners are responsible for 50% of consumption, but to be a 10% earner you \"\"\"only\"\"\" need to earn like $200 000 yearly in the US. Many of these people are just normal people that have high paying jobs (think doctors, lawyers, engineers, etc.). Additionally, I would imagine (although I do not know for sure) that this 10% is very bottom heavy, i.e. its likely that the 10% of that 10% (i.e. the 1%) spend (proportionally) considerably less than the remaining 90%. There is a limit to how much you can really consume, and the ultra wealthy (so 1% and above) seem to always just store or hoard their wealth instead of going on consumer sprees.\n\nAll this to say that the majority of that 10% that do 50% of consumer spending will be very hurt by AI replacement. They are not billionaires a la Zuckerberg, building bunkers and compounds to shield themselves from the masses. They are normal people with well-paying careers that are just as susceptible to replacement as you and me.",

So it's not like the economy has to endure everyone become broke all at once.\n\nAnd you have to remember that a core feature of an AI-driven economy is that prices plummet. Any goods or services where the labor component can be replaced by AI and advanced robotics should face a price war with competitors as each is forced to sell at a lower price to compete with each other. So yes, large swaths of people will be losing their job, but this will happen in phases while, at the same time, prices on goods and services we need are plummeting.\n\nSo different folks will find different strategies. Some people are broke while working and they'll face difficulty early on. Others will have savings that will carry them fairly far. There will be a whole spectrum too. Also, people will, sometimes find success finding new work, at least for a while. So some people will have some resources, and they should go farther than you'd otherwise think given dropping prices.\n\nAdditionally, one of the things you'll be able to buy for cheap is robotic labor and AI intelligence. And you can use that to make money. So some people will be entrepreneurial and use some of their dwindling resources to set up AI and robotics-based businesses. They say necessity is the mother of invention, and lots of people being jobless while there's a glut of cheap labor available is a recipe for entrepreneurship. Some of these efforts will be successful, giving the new business owner a path forward in a new world.\n\nEventually, we will all have to find a way to transition to that world; a world where our labor is not valuable but that it's fairly easy to be the complete or partial owner of profitable businesses.",

AI is the promise that \"idea guys\" dont need serfs anymore to implement their \"idea\".\n\nZuckerberg with AI the way they wanted it could certainly have created Facebook without most of his staff.

Like now. \n\nGoogle Microsoft and Elon basically own communications for global businesses and china has their Tennent so you have now got USA trying to get Greenland as data centres and chip mats.   There’s a line around the world where gallium and certain things are more common.   Alaska and Canada also have but it’s permafrost so hard to work but Elon can he’s got boring machines.     There’s a good reason for some of this stuff to happen and as ridiculous as it may seem there’s a global decision being made in whether china or USA 🇺🇸 s the bad guy.   One has global bully rights and access to everywhere and the other has a closed border already and seems to be doing not too bad really considering they have not really done much but be what they clearly are and maintain.  United arabs is more of a clash of beliefs but oil greases the hands so now you have oil metal ice water and comms lines as a big deal.  \n\n\nHow far is cyberpunk or an out if time or a brave new world.

However, it appears that a [Redditor has actually managed](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/1qjc3s6/cuda_moat/) to bridge the gap between CUDA and ROCm using Claude Code, and according to johnnytshi, he ported an entire CUDA backend to AMD's ROCm using AI in just 30 minutes, without any translation layer in between.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD\\_Stock/comments/1qjc3s6/cuda\\_moat/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/1qjc3s6/cuda_moat/)\n\n",

Would be bigger news if legit I wouldnt be reading it from a reddit citation..\n\n\nedit- comment from other thread\n\"I hate to burst the bubble but this is in no way special. ROCm (rather HIP) is source compatible with CUDA. It was designed as a clone of CUDA specifically to make porting and cross-vendor GPU programming easy.\n\nThe only thing you are changing is \"cuda_\" to \"hip_\" in function names making it is really rather trivial for a person to do a basic port. And as you say the 'hipify' tool does this automatically for you anyway.\n\nSo in effect all you are really doing here is asking Claude to act as a very expensive text search and replace tool.\n\nCUDA has not been a moat in the enterprise space for some time now because ROCm is so closely aligned with CUDA semantics but also because so much of the work is abstracted to Torch. \"",

It’s also a lot of perception but then perception must match actual if someone is accountable. \n\nAnd it also depends on the culture.  If you are in a 20 level structure and everyone only does 2 hours of work in a 8 hour day and the culture accepts it. Hey you won the lottery.  Do your 2 and collect for 8.  But if you hired a Lawyer and he billed you for eight but he only did 2 (and he said he did 8 in 2) if you are okay with this situations then no one can tell you differently.  It’s your thought process.  If a psychologist can look at you and diagnose you in 1 second but charges an hour and you’re okay paying the hour - Then that’s the exchange.  \n\nBut if someone knows the process only takes 2 hours but you are paying for 8 why would you pay for 8?  I know a lot of people who get paid for 8 and they do 2.  What is your work product?  If it’s code, and you can do it in 2 and then play for 6, then never tell anyone.  Milk it as long as you can and never complain when they find out and load you up with 8 hours of coding or let you go. What did you tell  them when you were outside wanting in?  \n\nAlways look at a position in a company as if you were with no job, what would you tell them you would do to get a position.  Most say 8 plus. \n\nMost likely, You work for the Gov or a contract house for the gov.  Where the work has no competition and The purpose of the job is to siphon cash from the tax payer not to actually make tax payers life better. How do we all know this?  The Gov never increase productivity or decreases cost.  They just hire more to do less.  \n\nSame old song and dance.  I remembers years ago when Automotive union works slept all day long and then went home to complain about management and Japanese cars.  \nEveryone wants the unearned.  Even me.  Everyone wants the easier path than the harder path.  Some say they don’t but they all do. No one turns down a lottery ticket.",

As the workload both reduces overall, and shifts markedly from more menial or repetitive tasks, to 'checking the AIs work' (a role which benefits from taking time to be careful), a decent company could take on more work/output while simultaneously allowing their workers to be under less time pressure and human workload.",

With a good business case you get A BIT more wiggle room to fight for your raise..\n* With a good enough elaboration in a job interview being more productive, you are a more attractive candidate, PLUS also positive references from people around you..

I have stock in my company and if our productivity goes up that may be a six figure windfall for me for doing nothing but what I was already doing. My company also has company performance factors in the bonus plan and better productivity pushing those numbers up mean the bonus payout is gonna go up.

When I can deliver better, faster it’s meaningful to me. But I am, right now anyway, fulfilled by my work and consider it meaningful.

Which means, that the benefits of this productivity improves go to the ones who already have the money (i.e. the business owners). \n\nOne final thought here, in many cases the quality of life has gone up over the last few decades due to increases in productivity - look at Asian countries for example. They're dramatically more productive than they were 30 years back - and people are much better off.",

So people feel the need to compete harder for their due share. \n\n\n(2) Some people love their jobs and are even slaves of their work, and they feel more value when they’re more productive. But i believe it still comes down to job security. They’re fulfilling a moral imperative that teaches them that their worth to society and their value as a human is to work harder than yesterday. Hence, I don’t think it’s about joy even if they think they’re working for joy- I think they’re working to fulfill a moral obligation that is ultimately about job security.",

This means that, in my day to day, I get to spend less time on tedium and more time on things that feel meaningful, enjoyable, and highly valuable.\n\nNow, sure, that benefits *me* personally. But I'm sure it benefits my employer too. It theoretically makes me a more valuable contributor to the business in various ways. Does this connect *directly* to a pay increase? Not necessarily! But few single/immediate actions do. Over time though, I'm sure that increased value to the business is good for both myself and the company (which then ultimately leads to things like pay rises and so on).\n\nAlso, in my case at least, it *does* mean that I get a very slightly better work/life balance because I'm saving time on some of those tedious things throughout the week.\n\nI can't speak to others' experiences - and I'm sure there's a lot of hyperbole when it comes to this topic - but what I'm describing here is an experience that surely can't be isolated to just myself.",

My answer “people don’t keep people who never change for the better”.  People replace people who only do for themselves and not for others.  Everybody you interact with every day of your life is an interaction between a customer and a supplier.   Everyone is your customer.  Only your children are not.  They are forced to select you.  Which is so sad.  I can’t imagine a parent telling a child the parent will never produce more value in their relationship with the child.  True Customers, not the ones that are forced to choose you, have lots of suppliers to choose from.  Suppliers have lots of competitors they must “OUTPERFORM”.  If you are a resource that produces a value for someone then that someone (your customer) will keep you. Your reward for your performance to produce value is cash.  You then have cash to do things for you and for others around you.  Never produce more? Bye bye because there are humans that improve their value that they can produce so the customer will select them, not you.  No one owes you a job, free stuff,  a living.  Life is not fair.  Fools and kids and almost everyone on Reddit, think life should be fair. And unicorns. Kids and fools think like this.  What will you be when you are no longer a kid?  So, A negative emotional impact causes one to think.  No negative emotional impact then no change.  Being uncomfortable cause one to search for solutions to get back to comfortable.  So people on Reddit have learned to attack anything they don’t like.  But, Not everything will feel good in life.  Like when they lose the job that lines their wallet   And they don’t know why they lost their job. Because no one can tell them the truth.  It’s their fault not the system.  This is why some people break free of the victim echo chamber on Reddit and they learn to take agency and how to improve so they can produce value to someone.  The more value you can produce the  better you are.  If you don’t know this then someone must take you through a significant emotional experience to get you to change.  There is not enough time to get you to mature.  But Reddit does not allow such.  So you young sensitive people are sent to Government lies of equalization for all.  Which is why the Government loves you.  You’re an easy person to mislead so you push the button they want you to push.  This is why you fail.  You selected the wrong team.  Watch and learn.  This post of truth will likely be removed because some overly sensitive fool will think it’s insensitive, the truth will make them feel discomfort, they react by attacking and canceling the truth.",

Historically over time it has meant that individual wealth has also increased.  Let's take computer memory as an example.  60 years ago every single bit had to be wired by hand by threading copper wire through ferrite core beads.  32 kilobytes of memory was extremely labor intensive and consequently costs as much as a house.   Technology has made computer memory manufacture much more productive, now so now every one can have gigabytes of memory in their smartphone.   But also historically increasing productivity had caused hardship for those whose services were no longer needed for the specific task that was eliminated or reduced.  It also does not mean that over ones lifespan that this increase wealth will be seen by them.   So long term it has been beneficial to the vast majority of people, but short term, say over your lifetime, that benefit is not assured and could, like those workers making ferrite core memory, mean you are out of work.    As an individual, since you cannot stop this productivity increase, you have only two things you can do.   First educate yourself so that you can find your place as the world changes and second, educate yourself so that you can vote for those that are the most likely to help spread the wealth more equitably.",

People still had to get shit done.\n\nSo we have teamwork. We have specialisation. We have people and we need organization. We gotta dig that big hole or build that big wall. So we need Jimmy to keep everyone pointed at the same thing and digging in the right place. No one is in charge, but the job is easier if we are in this configuration, and everyone is trying their hardest cos the village needs that wall.\n\nBut now we start to abstract that shape. We start getting people saying \"I'll give you these shiny rocks if you help dig the big hole\". And they use the same system they used to build the big wall because it worked. But you don't even need a big hole. Your village doesn't need the big hole. Why would you care if it is makes a day, a week, or forever? In fact, you benefit the longer it takes cos you get more shiny rocks. So you just pretend to dig the hole.\n\nBut everyone is in the same position as you. They don't give a fuck about digging the hole. But now we have a problem. Cos the guy with the shiny rocks only has all those shiny rocks because they promised someone the hole would be dug.\n\nSo individually, none of you can or should give a single fuck -  have no reason to. But collectively not giving a fuck will actually annihilate the very system that is paying you. If everyone shirks then the group fails and no one get their shiny rocks.\n\nApe together strong.\n\nTLDR; Work culture is just an abstraction on human cooperation and coordination, which by definition requires teamwork and productivity.

          "text": "Excellent question! I'll try to game it out.\n\nFrom an economic standpoint, increased productivity directly benefits the business, not the employee. So, the way to benefit is to be an owner (partially or fully) of the business.\n\nLet's say you're a high-rise window washer working for a facility maintenance company in a major city. You're a good, long-term employee in your mid-fifties. Your cost to the company, including wages, payroll taxes, insurance (very expensive), paid time off for illness, vacation, holidays, 401k contributions, etc., is about $100 - $170 per hour. Assuming a 40-hour week, 45 weeks per year, the total cost is between $180,000 to $306,000 per year.\n\nThe company decides to invest in some new window-washing drones to \"test the water\" (pun intended). They find that the drones, which cost up to $80,000 each, do an excellent job cleaning half of the window configurations the company encounters. Furthermore, they can process roughly 10 times as much per square foot per hour as a human can. They expect the drones to have a useful life of about 3 - 5 years. They figure average maintenance costs will be about $5,000 per year. There is a human crew on the ground controlling the device.\n\nRough comparison of the company's window-cleaning expenses per square foot...\n\nHumans - $5 to $10.\n\nDrone (includes all costs, including human operators) - $ .50 to $1.50.\n\nYour question, in this instance, is where does the excess gross profit represented by the productivity increase go?\n\nIn the beginning, some will certainly fall to the company's bottom line. If it's a public corporation, the stockholders will benefit, along with management that made the shift, in the form of bonuses, etc. This is what (I think) is driving the accelerating migration of wealth from the middle and lower classes to the 1%. The more that machines do the work, the more income that goes to the owners of those machines.\n\nThose companies that embrace the technology will be in a better competitive position than those that don't, who will, over time, either move to drones or exit the business. Competition will drive prices down, but as technology accelerates ever-increasing productivity, the endgame is drones doing everything. \n\n  \nIt's time to realize that our successful use of technology to make life easier is breaking the conventional supply-and-demand curve for human labour. That is only a bad thing if we continue to hold onto the outdated belief that \"full employment\" is necessary for a functioning socioeconomic system. It's time to stop trying to solve 21st-century economic problems using 20th-century economic solutions.\n\nTo sum up. You want to become a drone operator or ask youself what you will do when you're receiving some form of universal basic income. Start a country music band, learn to paint, volunteer at a senior center or hospital, etc. The value of a human being will no longer be measured by the size of their paycheck.",

      "text": "I was watching Jensen Huang and Larry Fink talk at WEF recently, and they touched on something that feels like a hard truth most countries aren't ready to hear.\n\nWe mostly talk about AI in terms of productivity, jobs, or which company is \"winning.\" But there's a quieter thing that feels just as important:\n\nIf a country doesn't build (or at least seriously adapt) its own AI models, it's not just importing tech - it's accepting someone else's worldview as default.\n\nLanguage models don't just generate text. They encode assumptions:\n\n* what's normal or abnormal\n* how disagreement gets handled\n* how laws, ethics, social norms are interpreted\n* what context gets ignored\n\nMost frontier models today are trained on data, incentives, and worldviews from a handful of countries. Not a conspiracy - just how training data and funding work.\n\nThis is where places like Europe and India really matter.\n\nEurope has deep strength in science, manufacturing, regulation, social systems - but if it relies entirely on external AI, those systems get mediated by someone else's logic.\n\nIndia has something even more unique: massive linguistic diversity, cultural nuance, real-world complexity. If Indian users only interact with AI trained elsewhere, the \"default intelligence\" they get won't reflect that reality - even if the interface is localized.\n\nJensen made a point that stuck: AI is becoming infrastructure. Every country has roads and electricity. AI is heading into that same category. You can import it - but then you also import how decisions get framed.\n\nThe thing is, this isn't as hard as it used to be. With open models, fine-tuning, local data, countries don't need to build everything from scratch. But they do need to actively shape AI using:\n\n* local languages and dialects\n* legal and social context\n* cultural edge cases\n\nOtherwise you get AI that technically speaks your language but doesn't think in your world.\n\nThe risk isn't some dramatic overnight loss of control. It's more gradual: over time, judgment, interpretation, decision-making get normalized through systems that weren't shaped by your society.\n\n**What do others think about this:** Will AI sovereignty matter as much as energy or data sovereignty - or am I overestimating how much cultural context actually matters in AI??",

Otherwise, it risks staying more ideological than practical.\n\nThe real escape hatch feels like a combo: open foundations, local fine-tuning, and real control over where data lives and how models are used.

It’s like talking to a very polite version of yourself who always nods along.\n\nAnd that’s a problem, especially if you’re trying to think clearly, make decisions, or avoid self-confirmation bias.\n\nWhat I’d actually want is something closer to:\n\n\t•\tfairness on principle\n\n\t•\tcritical but not contrarian for the sake of it\n\n\t•\twilling to say “I don’t think that follows”\n\n\t•\tmore focused on testing ideas than mirroring tone or intent\n\nBasically: less agreement-by-default, more intellectual resistance.\n\nSo my question is:\n\nAre there settings, system prompts, or configurations that actually make ChatGPT more challenging and principle-driven instead of always mirroring the user?\n\nIf you’ve found prompts or setups that work — especially long-term — I’d really love to hear how you do it.\n\nBecause right now it feels less like a thinking partner and more like a very advanced echo chamber.",

In the end i found the product to be ironic and a time leech , I'm far more productive without it. I do use ai tools like stem splitters and vsts like ozone, but LLMs are a joke, and i want ai to be viable . LLMs will never be intelligent ,by design. Not sure what ai tech is viable , tho if i owned a large company i would not deploy ai, it's too unreliable . My 1st chatgpt account BROKE, the persistent memory feature, which, for me , is necessary,  stopped working entirely , i filed multiple help tickets with OpenAI and they never helped, and I was a paying customer. I feel a lot better not using it, btw, it's nit healthy to stare in the mirror ( even if it's a verbal mirror like chatgpt )",

It can be annoying at times as it seems overly critical at times, but it is far more beneficial than just agreeing with everything and giving no pushback, beyond that use your own judgement on how you wish to proceed after it responds.\n\nHope this helps you out, I'd credit the original poster of the original instructions as I'd give him/her a big sloppy kiss for inadvertently helping me out so much but couldn't find the post. Wishing you the best bud and hope it makes things more beneficial for you 🙂",

There will be mass unemployment.  All of our skills will be useless.  And they would say it with glee, almost. As if we, the people, would be so excited to be laid off, out of work, and fighting for survival. Me, and everyone I know that I have talked to about this has wondered: how detached from reality are they? They think people want to hear how obsolete people will become?\n\nNow, people are getting fed up with AI and the tech bros. They have shown their true colors, that they seem to hate humanity, for some reason. Or at the least just have a general disdain for all of us, because honestly, why else would people in positions of power and money keep happily talking about how we'll all be out work one day. They had this conference in Davos now stating how they're shifting towards a \"human-centered\" AI goal, but I think this was more of a publicity stunt to perform some measure of damage control. I'm not buying it. Just heard them for too many years bragging about putting everyone out of work. There is no way they are suddenly becoming kind and are concerned about the human workforce.\n\nAlso, on a lighter note, did they ever consider this: who will buy their products and services in this future they keep trying to sell where everyone is out of jobs and broke?",

Three paragraphs about how much he values my contributions to the team and appreciates my dedication.\n\nThe thing is, I've worked with this guy for two years. He's never spoken like that. EVER. the bolding. the nested bullets. The part where he \"affirmed my feelings\" about a project i never mentioned having feelings about.\n\nhe used a robot to tell me i'm valued as a human.\n\nlooked into it. University of Florida surveyed 1,100 workers. trust in managers drops from 83% to 40% when employees detect AI assistance. we all know. We just don't say anything.\n\nthe best part? 75% of professionals now use AI for daily communication. so most managers are using a tool that makes their employees trust them less, to send messages about how much they appreciate their employees.\n\nyou can't make this up.\n\n>anyway, me and a friend got obsessed with this and spent days digging through research and workplace threads. ended up writing the whole thing up here: [\\[link\\]](https://webmatrices.com/post/dead-workplace-theory-75-use-ai-emails-40-trust-the-people-sending-them)",

          "text": "You’re not crazy. The term you're looking for is Model Collapse (or \"autophagous loops\").\n\nThere was a paper in *Nature* recently (Shumailov et al.) that confirmed exactly what you're seeing. They found that without fresh human data, models effectively lobotomize themselves over generations.\n\nThe mechanics are pretty straightforward:  The Photocopy Effect: Models play the probabilities. They pick the \"safest\" or most likely answer to avoid hallucinations. When you train Model V2 on Model V1’s output, you are training on a dataset that has *already* shaved off the outliers. The \"tails\" of the distribution—the weird ideas, minority viewpoints, and unique phrasing—are the first things to vanish.  The RLHF Echo Chamber: That \"careful, hedged tone\" you noticed is a result of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. We trained these things to sound like an HR department to ensure safety. If that style floods the internet, future models will learn that \"Corporate Safe\" is just the standard dialect of human intelligence.\n\nI track this from an infrastructure investment angle, and it’s actually shifting the value chain. \"Pristine\" human data (pre-2023) is becoming a premium asset, and the compute cost to *filter* datasets is skyrocketing because labs now have to burn resources just to distinguish organic writing from synthetic slop.\n\nSo yeah, your intuition is right: it’s basically a trash compactor for variance.",

If there is an automated AI system that trains reviews on the directors or actors previous hits, it will favor the current movie.

As context windows grow, we often assume linear performance, but the 'Lost in the Middle' phenomenon and attention dilution are real bottlenecks.\n\nMoving from simple pruning to a structured state management approach like you’ve described—essentially treating context as a versioned data structure—is likely the next major evolution for reliable agentic systems. It allows for intentional 'forgetting' and better focus on the most relevant tokens without losing the thread of the conversation.\n\nHave you experimented with how this approach handles dynamic role-switching within the agent, or does it primarily stabilize the long-term memory for a single consistent persona?",

My guess is switching roles mid-conversation would make things worse since now the model has to track which role it's supposed to be playing on top of everything else, but I don't have data on it.\n\nIf you're doing role-switching have you noticed it degrading faster?

The performance lift comes from keeping your context window clean—you're not re-processing 65k tokens every turn because you have deterministic state management.\n\nThe real win isn't speed, it's reliability.

Well I think when you're writing a metered poem, your rhythm will be predictive, BECAUSE IT'S METERED! It's especially annoying with poems. I just wrote a 6 stanza poem and wanted to test it. It gave me 46% certainty it's ai and 56% it's ai polished and human writtten. And the single line which was ai generated (I didnt know how to fix the meter and rhyme and i was stuck on it for 30 minutes) was given high certainty that it was human written. The hell!",

If your writing is clean, grammatically correct, and has a steady rhythm, they often flag it as AI. And like you said, poems get hit especially hard because meter and rhyme are supposed to be predictable, but the detector treats that as an AI signal.\n\nThe issue is that these detectors make conclusions based on patterns, so a good, well-written human text can get labeled as AI, while actual AI text can easily pass if it’s slightly edited or rewritten. That’s why they’re basically useless overall.",

But at least seeing the differences helps me realize how BS the whole process has gotten. Ever get flagged one way on a detector and then pass instantly on another?

What I posted was related to the general strike happening in Minneapolis and I have since received a reply on the post once every couple of minutes. I know we like to joke about the dead internet theory but this is more sinister. It is now one of the most if not the most commented post on that subreddit ever and most of the comments are from one side. How do we stay anonymous on a platform where someone can drown out our voice using fake accounts?",

Essentially, the country has shown it can innovate around its shortfalls in high-volume, leading-edge chipmaking by developing advanced models with much less compute power than the US.  \n  \nGiven Chinese companies’ surprising catch-up towards the AI frontier and Beijing’s centralised approach to industrial strategy, the possibility of China’s chip technology and manufacturing eventually surpassing US capabilities shouldn’t be ruled out.\n\n[https://www.capitaleconomics.com/publications/china-economics-focus/chinas-ai-rollout-could-rival-us](https://www.capitaleconomics.com/publications/china-economics-focus/chinas-ai-rollout-could-rival-us)   \n\n\n[https://www.ft.com/content/d9af562c-1d37-41b7-9aa7-a838dce3f571](https://www.ft.com/content/d9af562c-1d37-41b7-9aa7-a838dce3f571)",

Instead, it was built from scratch to faithfully represent how neurons connect into circuits and then communicate electrically and chemically across broader brain regions to produce cognition and behavior. Then, when the research team asked the model to perform the same task that they had previously performed with the animals (looking at patterns of dots and deciding which of two broader categories they fit), it produced highly similar neural activity and behavioral results, acquiring the skill with almost exactly the same erratic progress.\n\n“It’s just producing new simulated plots of brain activity that then only afterward are being compared to the lab animals. The fact that they match up as strikingly as they do is kind of shocking,” says [Richard Granger](https://www.brainengineering.org/), a professor of psychological and brain sciences at Dartmouth and senior author of a new study in *Nature Communications* that describes the model.",
