Their caste system (City vs Rural) basically ensures they will always have a large population of poor people to pull form as manufacturers, but they are struggling to convert to a true consumer-driven economy. In America, average people have disposable income, in China only the wealthy do...and their appetites are endless, but only for very high end goods that are not manufactured at scale.\n\n>China is THE thing all over the world.\nWould love to hear more about how China is \"THE thing\"\n\nI've visited several times, and China feels more like Vegas than Vegas does - the major cities cater to the wealthy with a very thin veneer that rarely holds up to closer scrutiny. \n\nI could talk about all the issues with America, but hyping up China is....very silly. It has a ton of problems including their caste system, income inequality, low personal freedoms, and so on. The speed of growth, and what the party has done to align varied interests, have costs that will need to be paid.",

Typically the whole country is onboard for that and it's citizens are fully engaged. Power generation, AI development, pharmaceutical manufacturing, etc... \n\nEven at the best of times, the US tends to have cliques, separated by class or ideology. Politicians and media tend to weaponize that to the benefit of donors and sponsors to maximize profits or power. \n\nI think this is why China will eventually be setting the stage for the globe in the next 5 to 15 years. They're just too unified even with all the problems that society in China has for civil rights or freedom of speech, they are edging ahead of a US that wants to be MORE authoritarian.\n\nI used to joke that learning Mandarin or Cantonese would be a great language for the future, but I don't think it's a joke anymore.",

Stevie goes on a one week tour of Chinas state of the art facilities and gets a skewed view of a country that still faces massive demographic decline, grotesque youth unemployment and a debt heavy local government system.  Dude sees a bright shiny yellow sports car in the lobby but misses the cracks in the floor it sits on.  He is over averaging factory floor efficiency and under indexing broader macro economic fragilities and realities.  \n\nThe US has a near insurmountable software advantage.  This article isn’t about Chinese capacity, it is about US complacency.   Let that sink in.  Any Chinese advantage isn’t taken because it’s something the US can’t do, it’s ground left unattended, easily claimed if the situation requires it.\n\nPeople hate to admit it but the US has baked in advantages that allows it play with a cheat code, to make mistakes but still thrive.  China isn’t a real threat to US hegemony.   Its primary use to the US is to act as the new boogie man, driving defense spending and public fear.",

          "text": "What people fail to understand is that AI is coming regardless of whether we like it or not. The world went through the same type of fear response when calculators came out, when television came out, when computers came out and when internet came out.  \nSome of the companies researching AI have larger budgets than certain governments.  \nThe idea that ai will lead to a surveillance state is also redundant since the us and governments have been doing that for at least 2 decades (snowden). Social media has been selling data since around 2018. Privacy is already a sunk cost.\n\nWhen it comes to people losing their jobs, that is another sunk cost. What the economy is currently going through IS the intended result of capitalism in an imperfect system. The elite that already have an established presence in the world market won't let newcomers join easily, and if the startups are successful all they have to do is buyout the IP or hire stooges to harass / sabotage them. (lobbying, mercenaries, blackmarket) If there is a way to replace employees and cut the bottom line corporations will do it. They don't give a shit about company loyalty.\n\nIn the US, impoverishment is used as a weapon. The more poor the populace the easier they are to control. It's essentially illegal to be homeless, and that gives a convenient excuse to imprison people, so now were going from a serf economy to literal slavery. Which is legal in the states as long as the slaves come from penitentiaries. Most of which happen to be owned by the other elite.\n\nSo if AI is coming regardless of what people want, if downsizing the labour market is an inevitable result of current economic systems, what options are we left with?\n\nWe either lay down and die, or we use the tools we've been given to empower ourselves, the people, and our communities. There is still time to create open source ethical AI. IF we combine this with other methods of production like 3d printing, earthscaping, and robotics, the people can tip market equilibrium in favour of small and private businesses.  If the people do it instead of openai or amazon, we take the tools of oppression out of their hands.\n\nI'm certain some people will argue about the consequences of end stage capitalism, but I'm not pulling this out of my ass. We cannot have a perfect economic system without some sort of missing x-factor to supplement the 3 laws of an economic system, all 3 of which are currently being violated. If done properly AI can be that supplementing x-factor, but it needs to be done properly: open source, public domain, bi-partisan, and not for profit. This would allow for an economic system that works as intended, and would reduce the coercive power the rich have over their employees, as well as the power they have over government through lobbyists.  \nIf we can reach this level at the very least (open source AI being utilized as a common tool for every person) even if the rich fire us en masse we will be able to thrive on our own, be aware of changes to the market that effect us on an individua level, and be capable of making rational decisions due to access to pertinent information.\n\nIf we scale it even further, an open source not for profit AI, would likely be our first method of achieving true bi-partisan logic. Imagine having the ability to call out politicians on their bullshit when they lie or propose policy that screws people over.\n\nTLDR: 1. AI is coming, if not AI than some other tool that will allow companies to lay employees off en masse  \n2. AI combined with other tools / research can empower the average citizen to atleast provide for themselves  \n3. AI if done properly (open source, not for profit, appropriate set up) could potentially fix the economy and government, because currently they're both broken.\n\nUBI is possible, it's already implemented in certain countries and cities including the US and Canada. The results of it consistently improve quality of life and reduce the exact things people worry about: laziness, drug/alchohol abuse, etc.\n\nEdit: thank you for coming to my ted talk ><;",

You’re basically asking: “If people don’t have paychecks, who buys anything?”\n\nShort version: if AI kills jobs fast and the money concentrates, demand drops and the economy gets weird. That’s the risk in the near term.\n\nLonger term, past tech waves usually didn’t delete work, they moved it. Some jobs disappear, new ones show up, and wages/markets eventually rebalance (sometimes with policy help).\n\nAlso, a lot of “AI replacing jobs” talk ignores reality: most workplaces still need humans for judgment, accountability, and handling edge cases. In safety especially, AI can help with the boring parts (checklists, reports, trends), but it doesn’t replace the safety pro who knows the site and can stop work.\n\nSo yeah, AI can cut roles.

Leaving many unemployed, without work this presumably assumes that governments will have to pay for UBI (unless they try and solve this problem with a war, which given geopolitcal climate wouldn't come as a suprise).\n\nHowever, the main issue that many overlook is the problem of Assets. Let's split this into 4 categories (very broad and missing a lot but gets the point out).\n\n**Category A:** Highly Rich elite; those who own AI companies or have multiple properties and assets which will make them fine in this situation.\n\n**Category B:** Middle-Class-Upper-middle Class property owners- Those particularly in the age range of 35-80 that had the opportunity to get on the property ladder early and then own their house outright/almost finished there mortgage.\n\n**Category C:** Those who are saving for a house at the moment or in the early stages of a mortgage. Generally 20-40 years old. These people may have spent their time saving up money but don't have the asset yet. Thus no security, particularly those who haven't even bought a house yet. Once you lose your job you will no longer be able to buy the house you saved for, now in a system with almost no social mobility you are more or less frozen out and you better hope that you have parents etc who are asset owners to live with.\n\n**Category D:** Same as category C, younger people who haven't started even saving yet, potentially baring a bit less resentment but being in an even worse position financially. Now seeing that their chances of social mobility are 0. There is no opportunity to ever own assets for these people.\n\nThis presents a massive issue. What happens with Asset distribution - would people in Category A and upper part of Category B give up their Assets? Or does it become a world owned by landlords where most are shut out because they didn't get the security of a home early enough. Choosing where you live becomes a luxury of the past because you now lack the social mobility of those born generations before you.\n\nHuman tendency to better our situations as well as for some own more than others/climb up the status hierarchy in ownership is now crushed for most. Adding a sentiment that I think will cause chaos. Imagine a society where you can literally not improve your life, you are stuck on the same wage provided by the government which does not give you the opportunity to acquire an asset.\n\nI would like to hear your thoughts, this is just one reflection I had and of course there may be some things I am overlooking here.",

As long as profits are going up, there is no further foresight going on.  \n  \nGenerally speaking, as new technologies make certain production lines easier or cheaper, the value of the produced goods and associated labor changes. If a production line near completely removes human labor, and it's costs have been effectively trivialized, the product is almost valueless. Things can be almost valueless and important though. We mass produce grocery bags, napkins, and other small items so efficiently, they are handed out most places for free. I imagine we might see similar shifts with other production lines over time with further automation. Things we used to pay for becoming nearly free, and new aspects of that thing being monetized. Perhaps restaurants charging basically nothing for food itself, but instead marketing the \"experience\" to customers or the preparation technique. Other fields might dry up altogether, with only niche artisans participating in them. It's another paradigm change, which will result in a different valuation system than what we've seen in history. One paradigm change in a countless succession.",

          "text": "*Marc Andreessen* believes the worry about AI taking all jobs is \"totally off base\" (25:07-25:09). Here's why he thinks AI is actually good news for jobs:\n\n* **A \"Miracle\" Timing** (0:09-0:12): For the last 50 years, technology hasn't changed much, and the population has been growing slower (22:46-23:00). This means we would soon have fewer workers (24:06-24:10). AI is arriving just when we need it most, like a miracle (0:09-0:12, 25:24-25:35).\n* **More Economic Growth, More Jobs** (23:39-23:46): Even if AI makes us 3 times more productive (which is a huge deal), it would only bring us back to how much jobs changed between 1870 and 1930 (23:07-23:15). During that time, people felt there were tons of opportunities, not fewer jobs (23:18-23:30). More productivity means more overall economic growth, which creates more new jobs than AI takes away (23:42-23:55).\n* **Tasks Change, Not Always Jobs** (39:28-40:10): Instead of whole jobs disappearing, *Andreessen* says tasks within jobs will change. For example, executives used to have secretaries type their memos, but with computers, they started typing themselves. The executive job didn't disappear; the *task* of typing shifted. Similarly, AI will handle many tasks, freeing humans for higher-level work (52:16-52:48).\n* **Human Workers Will Be Valued More** (24:10-24:16): With populations shrinking and less immigration, fewer human workers will be available. This makes the remaining human workers more valuable, not less (24:49-24:55). AI and robots will fill the gaps where there aren't enough people (0:11-0:12).\n* **AI as a \"Lever\"** (16:09-16:17): *Andreessen* views AI as a powerful tool that makes people \"spectacularly great\" at what they do (12:38-13:08). It's like a lever that allows individuals to do much more, leading to increased productivity and new opportunities (16:35-16:38). This means people will be able to do \"feats of magic\" in terms of designing and building new products (56:52-57:01).",

We know they will have more disposable income because those people that survive AI displacement have jobs that weren't automateable and are more likely to be highly paid. In this new world, the people who remain in the workforce have much more bargaining power as their skills matter more to company revenue generation. A company with 100 employees and generates 1B in revenue has to split that revenue across 100 employees. You can say that each employee is responsible for generating 1/100'th of revenue. A company with 50 employees (where the other 50 entry level roles have been made redundant by AI) can split 1B among 50 and give each one a lot more. Also, because each of those 50 employees can now be said to be responsible for a greater portion of the companies total revenue, the incentive is there to give them raises rather than lose their valuable skills to a competitor.\n\nOn a wider scale economic scale, this is already happening. In the US, a lot of consumer spending is mostly done by a small percentile of the highest earners because they are the only group who has a disposable income to spend. Theres no reason why this trend can't increase in intensity.",

AI does not need to replace most jobs to cause collapse. It only needs to replace enough labor to reduce hiring, destroy career ladders, and convince markets that humans are becoming economically optional. Income disappears before alternatives exist, demand collapses, and businesses automate even more, creating a self reinforcing downward spiral.\n\nThis does not require AGI. It is already happening through hiring freezes and expectation driven job loss. There is no stable version of capitalism where AI meaningfully replaces human labor without replacing income.\n\nWithout immediate course correction, severe global economic instability is unavoidable.",

AI will lower the number of employees (just like all prior technology has increased the output that a certain number of employees could produce), but not eliminate employees because Person plus AI is going to beat AI alone (all companies will basically have access to comparable same level of AI, so value add will still be in the Person). And so for companies to compete with other companies they will need to have Person plus AI, so that Person has a job and then goes out and buys stuff.\n\nThe companies might be able to make more and better stuff at a lower price because less employee costs, but that will just raise the bar for them to sell their stuff. They will still only make stuff or supply services to the extent there are customers. So Ford will still start the year estimating their number of sales and then adjust their manufacturing to their guess as to future sales. Folks will continue to want new cars. \n\nThere will probably be some massive disruption though with folks getting fired and having to find new jobs. Some will get better jobs, but some may end up with far worse jobs. But think about all the stuff you want and services you want but you can't afford to pay anyone to do that stuff. If there are more out of work people ready to work cheap, then you would get those things and services. I think there will continue to be quite a lot of jobs available,   though some of the jobs won't pay much.  ",

          "text": "Lot to break down here. Please critique and challenge.\n\nHere’s how I view the general sentiment of this thread: \n\nIf AI continues to improve and replaces most forms of cognitive labor, there will be a complete but gradual remaking of current economic paradigms. Labor (and consequently the body politic) will lose its leverage as it becomes increasingly redundant to total output. Owners of AI models will become rich beyond fantasy as they absorb and expand the productive possibility of humanity. We will be left as an appendage, gradually rotting off but meagerly sustaining ourselves by bartering scraps in a bifurcated world.\n\nWoah. Scary and even [based in some legit economic theory](https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c15315/c15315.pdf). But is that the optimal endgame? Even for the owners of AI? I think the reality is more complicated, thank Christ. Here are a couple roadblocks to the brave new world:\n\n**Friction 1: Increasing Computational Cost and Implementation Time to Replace Socially Entrenched Roles**\n\nRight now, as Amodei notes, AI’s ability to replace workers is mostly limited to entry level white collar roles focused on software development, data aggregation/engineering/analysis, and basic finance/accounting functions. These jobs’ technical natures provide low hanging fruit for AI companies. The argument generally goes, as I’ve seen it, that the increasing agentic and cognitive abilities of AI will allow for roles higher and higher up the corporate ladder to be swallowed until all that’s left is a big, fat, monocle-wearing man at the top. \n\nThere are many jobs that have so much social and political stratification around them that a supergenius AI couldn’t replace the without a timely upheaval of sticky institutions. Think trial lawyers or surgeons. I highly doubt my judge will appreciate me bringing chatGPT as legal counsel to my public urination trial, even if it has passed the BAR /s\n\nImportantly, these roles could still conceivably be replaced with some AI alternative and the individuals working them tend to enjoy more influential positions than their entry level counterparts. Point being: they will fight, at least for themselves, to be included in post-singularity abundance and have the social leverage to be successful. AI companies will consequently have to devote more computational resources and political capital to climb each subsequent rung of the socioeconomic ladder.\n\nThis is bad for the doomers. Two reasons (1) it gives the body politic more time to lobby government/vote in populists who could enforce the nationalization/redistribution of AI productivity while governance is still meaningful (2) the most influential/cash rich members of working society may become increasingly active in the effort as they realize their own apocalypse approaching. Now, is this an ironclad hedge? No, but the friction to replace other jobs may preserve the semblance of governance needed to allow for a more equitable landing post-AI transformation.\n\n**2. Consumer Replacement Challenges**\n\nThis is the friction OP wisely brings up. If most people with high paying jobs (many of which make up significant chunk of current consumer spending) like… who’s going to buy all of the stuff these now AI-run companies are producing?\n\nCommon argument is the newly ultra rich 1% will just consume more, allowing the economy to keep growing and satiating the growth obsessed Trump administration, but this seems, pretty freaking wonky when you look that. Think about samsung - will our tech overlords have a need to buy 8000 TVs to replace the consumption they’re displacing? It doesn’t work from a marginal utility perspective. \n\nUnless the AI companies can fully and rapidly automate all means of resource accumulation, there will remain a need for the market economy for their value prop to remain viable and thus redistribution.",

In a free market, prices tend to gravitate toward the marginal cost of production. If AI and robots automate the entire supply chain, from raw material extraction, energy production, to final delivery, the cost of producing something drops toward it costing nothing.\n\n\nWhen costs of producing something crash, the prices of that follow. If everything gets automated, the world won't be filled with massive amounts of goods no one can buy no oke can buy, there will be massive deflation instead.\n\n\nMoney is largly valued by how much labor it takes to produce something. Like, for example, the average American only needs to work like 2 weeks, to afford the amount of produce a feudal farmer produced in a year through farming.\n\n\nA \"rich\" person’s wealth is only valuable if it can be traded for things. If a loaf of bread costs $0.0001 because no human labor was involved in making it, the very concept of only rich people can afford things makes no sense because the cost of living has also plummeted.\n\n\nEven if you think some countries like the US will turn into dystopian hellscapes, If automation makes something cost $0.01, the price will eventually hit near $0.01 because if a company or country tries to charge more, a competitor from another company or country will use the same AI to undercut them.",

The main problem as I see it is that investment income has always been more unequal than employment income.  Those without the means to make investments will find themselves in a sharp corner.\n\nOf course, if AI ever becomes so autonomous that it generates wealth with no human input whatsoever, it may wind up making its own decisions what to do with all that wealth.

      "text": "“This week, OpenAI started testing ads on ChatGPT. I also resigned from the company after spending two years as a researcher helping to shape how A.I. models were built and priced, and guiding early safety policies before standards were set in stone,” Zoë Hitzig writes in a guest essay for Times Opinion. “I once believed I could help the people building A.I. get ahead of the problems it would create. This week confirmed my slow realization that OpenAI seems to have stopped asking the questions I’d joined to help answer.”  \n  \nZoë continues:\n\n>For several years, ChatGPT users have generated an archive of human candor that has no precedent, in part because people believed they were talking to something that had no ulterior agenda. Users are interacting with an adaptive, conversational voice to which they have revealed their most private thoughts. People tell chatbots about their medical fears, their relationship problems, their beliefs about God and the afterlife. Advertising built on that archive creates a potential for manipulating users in ways we don’t have the tools to understand, let alone prevent.  \n  \nMany people frame the problem of funding A.I. as choosing the lesser of two evils: restrict access to transformative technology to a select group of people wealthy enough to pay for it, or accept advertisements even if it means exploiting users’ deepest fears and desires to sell them a product. I believe that’s a false choice. Tech companies can pursue options that could keep these tools broadly available while limiting any company’s incentives to surveil, profile and manipulate its users.\n\n  \nRead the full piece [here, for free,](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/opinion/openai-ads-chatgpt.html?unlocked_article_code=1.LVA.L5JX.YWVrwH-_6Xoh&smid=re-nytopinion) even without a Times subscription.",

With AI companies, the risks feel a bit different like rapid deployment, model hallucinations, and not always being transparent about limitations. But at the same time, AI is still evolving super fast, and every major tech wave (social media, smartphones, cloud) had messy early phases.\n\nI think the real concern is who controls the tech and how it’s regulated. If AI becomes too centralized or profit-driven without guardrails, yeah, history could repeat. But if governments, researchers, and users push for transparency and safety, it might go a different direction.\n\nTotally fair if you’re stepping away though.

Changes like that can definitely affect how the experience feels, especially if you rely on clear, distraction-free answers for coursework and technical learning like you’ve been doing.**\n\n>**I can’t view the app UI. If you see a separately labeled sponsored item below my reply, that is an ad shown by the platform and is separate from my message. I don’t control or insert those ads.**\n\n>**What I can assure you of is this:**\n\n>**My responses themselves are generated based on your questions, context, and training—not advertiser influence.**\n\n>**Ads, if present, are clearly separated and labeled.**\n\n>**Advertisers do not have access to your private conversations.**\n\n>**My goal remains the same: to give you accurate, useful, and structured help—whether that’s networking labs, cloud computing assignments, or cryptography explanations.**\n\n>**If you ever want fewer ads, you can tap the “…” menu on an ad and choose options like “Hide this ad” or adjust preferences in Ads Settings.**\n\n>**And thank you for saying something—I genuinely value that you use this as part of your learning workflow.**\n\n>\n\nThe last sentence is interesting.  ChatGPT basically got me through Calc II.  I went from flunking exams to getting a B in the course.  And no, it wasn't giving me the answers; I did have to go in to class and take exams myself.  So... I'm not as cynical as most people about the product, but the company kinda sucks sometimes.",

          "text": "I’ve been thinking about why current AI alignment feels so \"brittle.\" We talk about \"aligning\" AI to human values as if those values are a fixed target. But they’re not. Society is a constant, high-tension struggle.\nThe Problem: A Tug-of-War, not a Real One\nThe problem with society today is that people don’t consider the tension of the stress of their ideology. They push it as far as they can, thinking that pulls the world their way. But in reality, if everyone’s not moving together, it just breaks.\n\nA healthy society needs to be a tug-of-war, not a real war. In a tug-of-war, the goal is the tension itself—it’s what keeps the rope taut and the game functioning. If one side \"wins\" by destroying the other, or if the rope snaps, the game is over.\nThe \"Slow-Motion Hack\"\nWe’ve seen this play out in history. Look at the \"slow-motion hack\" initiated in American politics during the 90s (the Gingrich/Limbaugh era). It wasn't a sudden break; it was a decades-long process of re-weighting language to drive people apart.\nIf we build a \"perfectly aligned\" AI today, we are essentially tying one end of that rope to a concrete pillar. If the AI is locked into a specific ideology, it becomes an immovable object. When the rest of society tries to move or evolve, the AI won't \"give\"—and the social fabric will simply snap.\nThe Solution: The \"Deformable Layer\" Architecture\nTo keep the rope from breaking, we need AI that understands Elasticity. I’m proposing a two-tier weighting system:\n1. The Anchor (High-Weight Core): A bedrock of human constants (Deep-time ethics, logic, and survival). This provides the \"inertia\" so the AI isn't easily swayed by passing fads or malicious \"hacks.\"\n2. The Deformable Layer (Low-Weight Surface): A layer that can slowly deform over time. This layer senses the \"tension\" on the rope. It monitors the \"stress\" of human disagreement and allows the AI to \"soften\" or \"give\" slightly to facilitate a bridge rather than a wall.\nDon’t Cheer for the Arsonist\nFor people cheering for their \"team\" in this AI war: be sure to look and see if you’re cheering for someone who’s lost the sense of the game. If you're rooting for an AI that \"finally tells the truth\" (i.e., your truth) at the expense of everyone else, you’re cheering for the snap. You’re cheering for a version of the world where you’re standing in a field alone, holding a frayed piece of rope.\nWe don't need an AI that \"wins.\" We need an AI that acts as a structural shock absorber—something that prioritizes the integrity of the humanity over the victory of any single ideology.\nA few things you could add to the \"Personal\" vibe:\n• The \"Spectator Trap\": Mentioning how easy it is to get a dopamine hit from seeing \"your\" AI dunk on the \"other side,\" and why that's a signal the model is failing.\n• The Technical \"Why\": Mentioning that without this \"deformation,\" an AI trained in 2026 is essentially a \"moral fossil\" by 2040.",

These predictions are overly dramatic.\n\nBUT, a crap ton of people are being pushed out of the workplace entirely, and this trend will continue. Just search for the term \"talent density\" and you'll find the transition that's happening and it perfectly lines up with the phenomena we're seeing (e.g. few entry level jobs). You don't need more people to scale anymore. You just need to reduce barriers for those left over.\n\nThe nature of white collar work is changing. Like everything else, it's becoming increasingly polarized. We're headed towards a place where the only people needed are high performers with strong judgement and those with irreplaceable \"on the ground\" roles.\n\nIt's not going to mean that a CEO and their board can run a team of thousands of agents. But it will mean that each individual department can be cut by 30% without any loss in productivity. If companies do this right, it should increase productivity because high performers are often constrained by bureaucracy and/or waiting for lower performing peers to catch up to them.\n\nSo, how do you figure out who has strong judgement vs. not? What will all those laid off people do who aren't deemed to be high performing enough? That's why hiring processes are a shit show eight now, even for top talent, and why at least part of the doom is accurate. There are no effective plans to address either of those things.",

Gone. There is no future in it. I would advise anyone in school to steer clear of computer...anything. \n\nI honestly don't think I will make it to retirement without changing my field. In fact, I am already reformulating my skillset to carry me through when I can no longer work as a developer. And that's OK. Software development has always been about agility and learning whatever the new shiny is, and now AI is the new shiny. Unfortunately for many (including me and probably you), it is the new shiny that will make our life's work obsolete. There's no need to cry over it. This happens. We're just used to it happening to other people like travel agents and book store employees.\n\nYou can stick your head in the sand and pretend it isn't true, but that won't change anything. It is true, and you really should be making plans about what you are going to do next instead of debating what AI can or can't do. It doesn't matter what it can't do today because it is improving exponentially every few months. What you can still do better than AI today will last a year at the most. What will you do then? Vibe code? OK...that works for a while until it doesn't need your input anymore. By \"vibe coding\" with it, you are training it to do your job, and it will. Even if you don't vibe code, it will still code better than you or me or anyone else pretty soon. \n\nThat is because your job is already obsolete...it's just that not everybody has gotten the memo yet. That's just the nature of technology. Coders have enjoyed a very long run of job security because they were the ones creating the things that replaced people's jobs. Now that we are on the other side of the coin, let's not be assholes about it and just move on to whatever is next. \n\nHate me, call me paranoid, downvote me, talk about my parents and my IQ, but that changes nothing. When you get through with all of that, you really should think about what you are going to do with the rest of your career. ",

It's fine for a tech startup to \"move fast and break things\", but there are serious reputational risks for established organizations who operate like that.\n\nPart of that is the fact there often isn't a huge first-mover advantage for implementing new technologies. A huge law firm could say replace all their paralegals with a AI. It could reduce costs and increase profits, but it's not like all other law firms are going to go out of business if they're not among the first to switch. You can let other people work out the bugs, and be ready to implement the AI Paralegal 2.0. And the first movers just need one hallucinated brief going viral on the internet to kill any potential benefit due to the reputational harm. \n\nThere are also security and safety concerns, which slow things down even more. When I was first out of college in the mid-2000s, I worked at a nuclear fuel plant that used 5.25\" floppies to save fuel rod test records. The floppies would last like 10 days before filling up, and the production line would be shutdown until a quality engineer could come down and change it out. This could happen on third shift or the weekend, and they'd have to wait an hour for someone to get there. Also, even getting 5.25\" floppies was difficult by that point. However, the system worked and implementing a new system would be expensive up front especially given the testing and certifications required. So, they didn't.\n\nSimilarly, there's all these studies on AI reading x-rays or CT scans, or MRIs faster and better than doctors. But we have laws about who can perform specific medical tests and make diagnoses and prescribe treatment. In those areas, AI can assist, but they won't be able to replace for some time. An AI can save 100 lives noticing things a human would miss, but if it makes a mistake a human would catch and sends someone to get unnecessary chemo, people will be outraged. \n\nI'm still worried jobs being replaced, but it's not surprising that the timelines may be longer than people expect.",

It is less about optimism or pessimism and more about who carries the risk.\n\nWe often say it is better to stay positive, but that advice lands differently depending on your cushion. Large AI companies have billions in funding and can afford to experiment, fail, and pivot without immediate consequences, whereas the average worker or small entrepreneur cannot afford long periods of uncertainty or repeated missteps.

The economy is fucking cooked. Almost no job is inherently safe rn. But it has (almost) nothing to do with A.I. (but the A.I. bubble isn't helping)\n\n2. A.I. and automation is here, and it's insane. But it's not replacing any jobs.\n\nSo why are these things both true? And why am I officially convinced that A.I. is way beyond being able to automate a lot of jobs, but isn't? And what does this have to do with what happened at work today?\n\nSo, I work in engineering (specifically a technician, working in electrical design, automation and PLCs, etc. I do a lot of wiring, panel-building, AutoCAD drawing, and starting to learn PLC programming and automation stuff).\n\nToday, my supervisor and I got a demo from a company selling engineering design software. My boss is sick of AutoCAD as it's trash for electrical stuff. So we are looking for new design software.\n\nI was FUCKING BLOWN AWAY at what they showed us today. Literally just fart out entire schematics, designs, 3D and 2D models, essentially speak it into existence and it automatically lays everything out from the type and size of wire you need, optimal placement, spatial dimensions and best locations, routing, etc...and then automatically generate 3D builds, or keep it as various schematic types.....and even the ability to send this stuff directly to automated panel-builders and wire processing machines....no electricians required..... fucking STAR TREK  🤯\n\nLike I was sitting there thinking we would never need to hire another electrical technician again. Maybe barely even another electrical engineer. Like me and my supervisor could just up our productivity by an incomprehensible multitude......\n\n\nBut, such software is very expensive, and if you are a company, in this economy, right now is NOT the time to invest in things like this and \"test them out\". Better to just stay with what you have and hire some interns, electrical helpers, technicians, designers and drafters, etc. \n\nSo I was just blown away bc suddenly it all made sense to me.\n\nWe are not in an A.I. bubble AT ALL. We are in a ChatGPT/consumer LLM bubble.\n\nChatGPT can barely even help me with my job at all....let alone do it for me.....but the Machine Learning and automation software we got demoed today? Ohhhh boy. \n\nBut the economy is fucked, and companies get rewarded for claiming to cut jobs in favor of A.I. (i.e. cut salaries and pay a tiny subscription for shit like ChatGPT which can't do anything for them).\n\nSo yeah, I'm 100% convinced that the tech is here, and continuing to improve. But I'm also 99% sure we are in an LLM bubble, and it is definitely crippling the adoption of actual ML and A.I. that would change the game.",

Azure, AWWs, GC are still the biggest players in the ecosystem, even if you leave AI aside.\n\nWhat I do expect, is that open source will keep the competitive pressures on the big players, and model + compute will remain separate components that you can combine as you need, and vendor lock in won’t happen so easily.\n\nConsumers will still buy into a single ecosystem, bc it’s less friction (Again, you can just look at consumer behaviour without AI in software in general), but business users will combine what they need.\n\nCompute is a commodity, and models seem to be going that way as well. As long as models continue to be within +- 10% of each other, they will be a commodity (open source or not) and behave as a commodity, then the differentiation space will live on the application layer. Now if the models eventually become so powerful that they make the application layer a commodity as well (and continue to be similar in performance), we’ll start to see some very interesting commoditisation effects across the entire tech industry.\n\nIt does feel like it will end up being one of two extremes - either there’s a winner takes all where someone leapfrogs into AGI and steamrolls everything else, or there’s an even playing field and it’s a commoditised race to the (stable) bottom.\n\nTech companies are spending like they’re betting on the first, but past few years have had many more signals that it’s going to be the latter.",

See smartphones, where third party software is already sandboxed and has no access to the system unless Apple/Google allows it. Rabbit R1 already ran into the issue, it could have just been software, but the sandboxing was too restrictive for them so they build a new hardware device instead.\n\nOr just look at Android, it's Open Source Linux if you dig deep enough, but that's completely irrelevant for the average user, since they aren't allowed to touch it. Google is in control. Open Source doesn't guarantee freedom, you can build prisons for the user with Open Source just fine.\n\nAll that said, I am still somewhat optimistic here, a lot of the traditional lock-in methods, which mostly just make tasks annoying enough for the user to not bother switching to alternatives, don't work when you have AIs to workaround them automatically.",

It’s in distribution, proprietary data, infrastructure, and how well AI is embedded into real business workflows.

This is false, and I will explain why:\n\n1. Companies lay off people due to AI while not hiring new people.\n\n2. Unemployment rises with no valve to alleviate the issue. As a result, consumer spending drops massively.\n\n3. As consumer spending drops, companies generate less revenue. This forces further cuts being made, resulting in even more people being laid off.\n\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until most companies go under because there just is no money in the economy anymore; in their blinding greed, companies killed the demand for their own supply.\n\nThe end result (I think) is the AI companies, electricity companies and resource extraction companies being left standing. No one else. Humans will transition into a more localized economy, while the remaining companies will essentially operate in isolation.\n\nThe end result of this is obviously that the insane buildout of AI data centers (which is all based on projected demand) falls dramatically. Turns out that you dont need many data centers at all after most companies cease existing! That will the event that bursts the bubble, but in reality it will be the collapse of the economy.",

LLM coding capabilities improving and AI video getting more realistic have been the steady, predictable trends. \n\nMore specifically — that project I was working on is now complete and it doesn’t seem like I’ll even need to look at code for the foreseeable future. The vast majority of people don’t engage with code. So I’m wondering how any of this relates to my life.\n\nBecause the best read I can make right now is that this has been a paradigm-shifting cataclysmic event in the world of software engineering and that people who work in that field are projecting that observation outward onto everyone else.

Writing unit tests, automating alerts, etc.  however, there is no world or chance where I can see these automating junior engineers entirely or eliminating the field at all.  Me and my entire team (most people in my org even that I’ve talked to), have all agreed we would never use it for actual production business logic.  Every model I have used has made numerous mistakes in production code.  For analysis and sql it’s even worse, I’ve had every model create phantom information even from a static data set (example is analyzing cities that are not even part of an experiment rollout, my prompt was basically to analyze one XP vs another given two different city lists and merge them into one list with unique cities).  It created a report that made no sense, and I had to spend the better part of a day to fix it manually.  Stuff like this really hampers my trust in the tech as this is stuff that is easily done, but mistakes are still made.  Not only that but some of the tools and models are horribly maintained.  Cursor seems to be in constant outage mitigation, Claude goes down frequently, chatGPT also faces high latency depending on the model.  All of this is to say, people who are claiming these tools are gonna eliminate jobs entirely are completely lying.  \n\nDo they help with some tasks? Yes absolutely.  \n\nDo they boost productivity? Maybe, depending on how one measures it.  \n\nDoes it increase tech debt? Resounding yes, our codebase has grown to be just insurmountable levels of spaghetti code and awful code practices.\n\nIs my experience with these tools positive? Mixed here.  I do love that I don’t have to copy paste tons of unit tests and I can just prompt the agent to write a unit test to test for all edge cases and have complete code coverage.  However, in its current state, there’s so much hand holding involved, I do sometimes find myself just doing more of the work manually as it takes more time to debug these LLM models themselves rather than just writing the unit tests and other stuff myself.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen in my company “productivity stats”, the number of diffs per Eng has actually gone down since we have adopted LLMs in our workflow over the past year.  Number of incidents has gone up as well.  Lines of code per diff has gone up, but as mentioned before this is because of mass spaghetti code and increased tech debt.  However, there is massive pressure from C Suite to adopt these tools, and that in itself is now a political discussion whether to fight back or not.  Just personally, I think there’s been little to slightly negative experience within the company.",

But we have enough of a picture of what's coming that we can foresee a lot of the problems that come with it.  Rather than trying to stop AI, we need to be quickly preparing to nullify those problems.  Implementing things like Universal Basic Services and Universal Basic Income, funded by some of the GDP gains that AI promises, would go a long way towards heading off some of the problems that are coming.\n\nBut something like that won't happen without intense societal pressure.  And society isn't engaged enough on the topic in a unified way for that to happen (until some catalyzing event, at which point the pressure happens immediately and everywhere, and that almost always is messy.)\n\nWe're still at a point where a good chunk of the population is almost aggressively of the opinion that AI isn't useful and will completely fail as a tech fad.  They latch on to out-of-date research, commentary from anti-AI influencers, and social media posts that support their bias and they bury their heads in the sands.\n\nAnother chunk of the population is willfully ignorant.  They don't know what's coming and don't particularly want to be bothered by it, they want to believe that everything will work out in the end.  This is understandable, and there's *certainly* plenty else to worry about in today's world without having this on your plate.  But frankly, 'everything will work out in the end' isn't a predetermined outcome that will just *happen*.  If we want it to work out, we will have to work towards that goal (and not many people are doing that right now)\n\nAnd finally, you have the AI optimists who expect a sci-fi future where we all have high universal income in a post-scarcity society.  Which is fine as an aspirational goal, but again this isn't just going to *happen*.  If we want a positive outcome we're gonna need to work for it.\n\nSo my advice is don't just be using AI tools.  For the good of society as a whole, start engaging on the topic.  Educate yourself then educate others.  We have to wake up to what's coming if we're going to make the world what it needs to become.",

To your point about dissolving value,  let’s play out the math.\n\nEven if we grant the  technological miracle that AI can automate 90% of my current tasks, that doesn't mean my job disappears. It means the 10% that remains—the edge by cases, the complex architectural failures, and the impossible P0 outages, becomes my entire focus.\n\nIn SRE, the easy 90% was never the hard part, it was just the toil. If you automate the toil, you don't fire the engineer, you just ask them to solve the next level of harder problems that the AI can't touch. This is classic Jevons Paradox: as a resource (coding/automation) becomes cheaper and more efficient, the demand for high-level oversight and complex problem-solving actually increases.\n\nAlso, let’s check the calendar. Mark Zuckerberg went on record (via Joe Rogan and others) promising that by 2025, AI would effectively be doing the work of a mid-level engineer. It’s now 2026. I’m still here, my team is still here, and the AI still can’t take responsibility for a decision in a post-mortem. I say bring it on: I’d love for it to handle my toil so I can focus on the stuff that actually requires judgment.",

From what I can piece together, this is Matt Shumer's \"Something Big Is Happening\" post where he draws an extended analogy between COVID — nobody was paying attention, then the world changed in three weeks — and AI. Then it pivots into advice about pushing AI into your actual work rather than treating it like Google.\n\n>A few things that stood out to me: The COVID analogy is doing a lot of heavy lifting and is a bit manipulative as a rhetorical device. It's designed to make you feel like if you're skeptical, you're the person who didn't take the pandemic seriously early enough. But the comparison breaks down pretty quickly — COVID was a discrete, rapid-onset event with clear before/after. AI adoption is more gradual and uneven, and \"not being worried enough\" about AI isn't the same kind of mistake as ignoring a pandemic.\n\n>The practical advice itself (don't just use it for quick questions, push it into real workflows) is actually reasonable and something you're already doing at your company. But it's wrapped in this breathless urgency that makes it feel like a sales pitch — which makes sense given that Shumer is CEO of HyperWriteAI and has a direct financial interest in AI enthusiasm.\n\n>The Bluesky reaction from Max Read nailed it: he called it a \"twitter essay designed to one-shot bosses everywhere.\" That feels right. It's less aimed at people like you who are already deep in AI-assisted development and more at executives who need convincing to invest in AI tooling.\n\n>As someone who's been living the AI-augmented workflow daily, you're probably better positioned than Shumer's target audience to know where AI actually delivers and where the hype outpaces reality.\"\n\nEdit: I should probably share my prompt that resulted in this answer, too, so others can understand how I articulated my bias to the LLM.\n\n>Hey Claude, is this article maybe overselling AI a bit?",

Similarly, when he describes how AI’s are doing longer and longer tasks on METR’s famous task-time benchmark, he neglects to say the criterion on that benchmark is 50% correct, not 100%, and that the benchmark is only about coding and not tasks in general. No AI system can reliably do every five-hour long task humans can do without error, or even close, but you wouldn’t know that reading Shumer’s blog, which largely ignores all the hallucination and boneheaded errors that are so common in every day experience. And of course Shumer didn’t cite [the new Caltech/Stanford article that reviews a wide range of reasoning errors in so-called reasoning models](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/breaking-llm-reasoning-continues?r=8tdk6) \\[or the Apple reasoning paper or the ASU mirage paper, etc\\]. The picture he sells just isn’t realistic, however much people might wish it were true. I should add that Shumer is [the guy who was once famous for apparently exaggerated claims about a big model of his that didn’t replicate and that many people saw a fraud](http://(https//venturebeat.com/ai/reflection-70b-model-maker-breaks-silence-amid-fraud-accusations)); he likes to sell big.

              "text": "The discrepancy is because the field changes fast, skeptics are mostly working from outdated information, and people testing the most recent models become like Shumer quickly. There are a few reasons:\n\n1. Most skeptics know that LLMs are pretrained to guess the next word, but never learned about the discoveries that happened in early 2025. The new paradigm is called Reinforcement Learning on Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). The LLM is prompted on math and programming problems, it outputs a reasoning text followed by the final answer. That final answer gets compared to the truth (or tested, in the case of programs) and the LLM is rewarded/punished based only on how correct the final answer was. Reasoning text that lead to correct answers is reinforced. LLMs trained like this learn strategies like splitting problems into smaller steps, noticing when they are making mistakes and saying \"Wait, that doesn't work. Let me try another way…\", and writing and running programs to test hypothesis. Those strategies are not taught directly, they just learn that because those strategies lead to correct answers more often during training. LLMs like these often reason for 10 minutes, in a process that mixes reasoning text, internet searches, writing and running programs and using computer tools (like file searches).\n2. Those models are usually only available for paid users. Most people, when they use chatgpt, will get the free version that doesn't work like this at all. The free chatgpt is closer to 2024 tech. It makes dumb mistakes all the time. Most people have bad experiences and never learn that something better exists.\n3. Most redditors are just repeating \"AIs just repeat the average of human text\" from other redditors that don't study AI.\n4. A huge jump happened in november of 2025. Claude Opus 4.5 on Claude Code is much better at computer use than previous LLMs. One example that happened to me and my friend two weeks ago: He told Opus to make a desktop widget for him and left it to work as we talked. A few minutes later we notice his computer was taking screenshots by itself. We checked on Opus and saw that it was writing the code for the widget. taking a screenshot (using a terminal command), cropping on the right region of the image, taking the image as input and using it to see flaws in the widget. It repeated that many times until it got it right. But Opus 4.5 was released almost three months ago. Most people don't know it can do that.\n5. Another significant jump happened just last week. Claude Opus 4.6 is like 4.5 but a bit smarter and more relentless in the pursuit of its tasks. If you work on a software system and give it full access to your code and your tools, you can usually say \"Find and fix this bug\" and Opus 4.6 will usually succeed. It modifies and then tests your system in a iterative loop. Often creates many subagents so each can study one thing (example: I was migrating to a new version of a software library, one subagent was \"get the code and documentation from the internet\" and the other was \"study and explain the user's code\", all done before writing the plan to write the code). When my build script had issues, it solved those issues before continuing on its task. In the same week I was trying to solve an issue with an AI pipeline I work on, my main strategy was saying \"read my code, test change X on a random sample of the data and see if there is a correlation with issue Y\". It made scripts based on my code to test my ideas. When an error happened, if fixed it and tried again. I solved the issue in a few hours, and without Claude Code I would have taken many days. People say codex-5.3 (released on the same day) is a better programmer, but I haven't tested it enough.\n\nMost people never bothered to study and never tested the new models. I've never seen such a large disconnect between reality and online conversation. Opus 4.6 on Claude Code is blatantly smart, in a way that you notice the moment you tell it to solve a hard problem. I recomend that you, instead of trusting me or anyone here, just test them on hard problems you want to solve.",

RLVR attempts to solve the alignment issue by rewarding behaviour and objectives in directions aligned with the model creators.\n\n\nWeight based rewards in neural networks for training has been a thing since the 1980s. I was doing college projects on it.\n\n\nSplitting problems into smaller steps does not happen within the weight trainings and is not encoded into the parameters of the model. It's a part of the scaffolding around the product. You can invoke Opus 4.5 stripped of all system prompts and scaffolding on AWS Bedrock using an inference job and you won't get the same results as the Anthropic Claude product in \"thinking\" mode. It's the meta self prompting framework built by humans around the model, the model did not decide autonomously to verify the text it's outputted.\n\n\nThe difference between free and not free is usually model quantization to reduce how much computation each query needs. It is not \"2024 tech\". Eg: Sonnet 3.7 and lower being deprecated and no longer available for inference.\n\n\nFor point 4, again, I think you need to go into how much engineering and thought is going into the Claude Code / web scaffolding and integrations. Their docs are publically available. This is again not the model autonomously developing the ability to screenshot apps, or coming up with the idea itself either. The workflow and tools are built out.\n\n\n4.6 has had no meaningful improvement over 4.5. literally check anywhere, that's the overall sentiment.

I'll tell the AI: \"I want to build this app. Here's what it should do, here's roughly what it should look like. Figure out the user flow, the design, all of it.\" And it does. It writes tens of thousands of lines of code. Then, and this is the part that would have been unthinkable a year ago, it opens the app itself. It clicks through the buttons. It tests the features. It uses the app the way a person would. If it doesn't like how something looks or feels, it goes back and changes it, on its own. It iterates, like a developer would, fixing and refining until it's satisfied. Only once it has decided the app meets its own standards does it come back to me and say: \"It's ready for you to test.\" And when I test it, it's usually perfect.\n\nHonest question: what tool is this happening in?  I don’t see the AI able to launch and “see” the UI in the ones I’ve used (Cursor and CoPilot).",

Probably a ton of jobs will be replaced by AI, but so many jobs were “bullshit jobs” to begin with.\n\nIf you make a trade in the stock market and come out on top, you might feel like a genius, when in reality you effectively randomly traded and information you misperceived or made up, but you just ended up in the upper half of the distribution of people who randomly traded and did OK. We can look ahead n trades and predict that unless you start trading on real signal, the probability you can stay above water becomes vanishingly small. That said, a ton of people still trade, get lucky, feel like geniuses, and keep going only to lose their money.\n\nLLMs are the kind of the same. You get something good out and it feels like it’s a genius, but you didn’t get that result because it’s a genius, you got that result by drawing token vectors from a latent space, or letting something approximating a Bayesian walk through that space draw the vectors for you.\n\nIn every moderately complex project I have worked in without exception (so far!) LLMs have messed stuff up. Use to be obvious errors, and now it’s subtler errors and corrupted data.\n\nThe reason this article is hype is that you still can’t trust an LLM with anything important. When you give them a task, they are simulating what an intelligent process would look like if it engaged with that task. Whether this is ontologically identical to actually being an intelligent process is irrelevant, because the simulation of that process in this case is using dogshit representations of the task, it cannot dynamically expand its internal representation of the problem space, and its representations appear to be completely uncorrelated with human representations on a deeper level.\n\nThe reason why this article isn’t hype is that a ton of jobs don’t require precision, and sub-par BS work is a perfectly acceptable result, because no one at any level of the totem pole knows the difference. Consulting work that delivers unfalsifiable/untestable forecasts or recommendations is arguably a good example.",

I am trying to use the organizational approved Claude AI to provide code and instructions on doing this.  I am finding it increasingly frustrating on communicating with the AI.  I go through multiple prompts and find multiple errors in what it provides as it relates to what is in the site, what Microsoft Power Automate steps in a flow are, and multiple errors in how it communicates the steps.  Overall I am not impressed with this AI.  I am just not.  I get that those working with the AI in other areas are saying that its going to take over in 3 years.  Maybe it will, but guess what in 3 years alot of shite can happen.  In the mean time I am going to continue to try and get Claude to understand how it sucks at providing me JSON code as it relates to getting my cloud flows right to hopefully get the automation buttons I want in my SharePoint lists working.   AI is not there for me.  Its an assistant and it needs alot more guidance before it gets to where I feel like I can rely on it for more stuff.  Prompting it every which way for me is not the problem.  It just does it the way it does which is as\\*backwards.  With that said I have no doubt AI will impact work but go in this with eyes wide open!  The people prophesying AI are working with AI alot, so they are excited about this.  Awesome! let them be excited, they should be.

          "text": "”The AI labs made a deliberate choice. They focused on making AI great at writing code first... because building AI requires a lot of code. If AI can write that code, it can help build the next version of itself. A smarter version, which writes better code, which builds an even smarter version. Making AI great at coding was the strategy that unlocks everything else. That's why they did it first. My job started changing before yours not because they were targeting software engineers... it was just a side effect of where they chose to aim first.”\n\nSo here’s the problem with this narrative: the big advances we’ve seen in AI have not fundamentally been about ”better code”. It is much more related to more compute and more data. Having Claude code as a co-worker at Anthropic can possibly save them some money on development costs, but it isn’t going to get them new breakthroughs on the level of Attention Is All You Need. \n\nAI will self-improve by understanding its code and rewriting it was the original idea behind The Singularity, and it seemed a lot more plausible before the current paradigm.",

As Eric Schmidt has suggested, the industry seems unlikely to self-regulate until a significant disaster forces a global pause.

The paper proves that demand-driven recessions are harder to recover from than supply-driven ones.\n\nA demand-driven recession is when people choose to stop buying and making stuff because they're scared.

No, they r just harvesting meta data from the same experiments and then adjusting it for their papers thesis. Creating circular references between their phd advisor and other phd students that agree with them to give the appearance they r building on the solid research of the people who came before them, but that wasn’t solid research either, just the last classes circular references. \n\nThere is alot of people, who made a good living for a good number of years doing very little actually productive to society work and that is about to be exposed.",

Neither of these things can happen efficiently or at the rate required for science to make progress without also supporting (economically) a large amount of academic \"fat\". \n\nIt is true that we support a lot of people who, on the periphery, don't \"deserve\" what they get. But(!!) you have to view them as performing a metafunction-their being supported is the best way to support the people who actually do thing and the projects that actually are societally productive.

You see it in engineering, the unspoken firings/layoffs that people don't talk about.  \"AI will do the drudgery, the grunt work, and free us to do the thinking, the interesting work!\"  But... we all spend time on that supposed 'grunt work' now, we all get paid to do that.  When you get rid of work... you get rid of people.  Saying \"oh, that was boring work anyway\" doesn't change that.\n\nWe'll take a department of 20 people, and in the end it will be down to maybe 4 people who have a type of \"Technical Project Manager\" role, whose job is to coordinate all the work the AI is doing.\n\nThat's great on paper for the company doing that, but... That's an 80% reduction in jobs.  Saying \"we still have some skilled experts on the payroll\" doesn't really comfort all those people out of work.",

Unlike my dad, I have thousands of sources readily available to me, and takes two seconds to figure the most popular sources and the most recent sources. However, I now have all of these really great sources and now I need to interpret them and find the best ones. \n\nMy dad spent hours finding books that pass a minimum standard. I spent minutes finding the best possible sources. Now, if we both spend the same overall time on the same paper, who will likely have the higher quality end product?\n\nThe paper with the best sources, where the author was able to spend more time on what really matters. Diving into the details and finding interesting and new conclusions. \n\nWith Ai, students today don’t need to spend as much time interpreting sources. They can get a summary of any paper, any article. They could just ask their model to give an outline with the best available sources. But, their effort is different. Given multiple valid interpretations of the same set of facts, how do you find the best overall interpretation? How do you combine them?\n\nIn the end, their paper will likely be a better end product than ours too (if they don’t just vibe write it of course), even though their effort may not look the same. \n\nYou won’t lose your job to Ai.

It’s incredibly easy to stop caring, fall into a pattern, and end up with a hallucinated paper that you don’t even understand. I think that’s the fundamental trade off. \n\nFor example, I could just grab the first 4 or 5 sources that come up in google, barely read them and just pull a few sentences that look good. That could result in a paper that could look “hallucinated” too. Like, reading one sentence and not realizing that the entire source was making the counter point. \n\nBut, I think this actually makes it interesting. Someone could just read an Ai summary, have it write their paper, and turn in garbage. Someone without Ai could choose to not write it at all or not care, rephrase the first few google results and write complete crap. \n\nThe interesting thing is even in this scenario, it seems like the “vibe writer” will still end up outputting better quality with less effort. Although compared to peers will look just as bad. \n\nSo, even then the “slacker” does produce better quality work with Ai than without, even if it’s just as low quality relative to their peers. That’s the interesting thing, I think the quality will rise between generation in an objective measurement to previous generations. But, you now actually need a higher quality paper to differentiate yourself from peers. That’s in the slacker case and in the real pro case",

Oh interesting, it seems like 2, 4, and 5 actually disagree with 1, 3, and 6 in reasoning, interesting. Well, 1,3, and 6 also have more recently generated sources that disprove it, so that’s likely the old way of thinking. \n\nI’ll focus on 2, 4, and 5. Although, I’m a little confused by this point made on why the other sources are wrong. Lemme ask the model to clarify that for me. \n\nGo through that cycle and eventually you’re like, “Cool I now have a well formulated outline of how I wanna approach this and some good snippets of writing and logic I can use in the paper. Now lemme double check my sources and start writing. \n\nLater; “Hmmmmm. I don’t know how to phrase this in the right way. And I think my introduction sucks. Lemme get these sections refined.”",

Then the \"big brains\" in government will do their Homer forehead slap and wonder how anyone could have seen this coming. \n\nOr, it'll just be a big collapse. Companies will replace a ton of workers with AI, and their profit margins will temporarily shoot way up, and the CEOs will cheer in their private jets and champagne parties. Then the GDP collapses, no one buys their shit bc everyone is broke or scared, and they're forced to drop prices like rocks, resulting in their newfound profit vanishing. Then they'll say \"well shoot, I can't afford to hire anyone now, muh profits done dried up\" and after a few years ol' Uncle Sam will give the billionaires a big ol' handout so they can go hire some workers again, and eventually it climbs back up. \n\nOr maybe companies won't use AI as just a cost-cutting tool. I think a lot will because most managers aren't imaginative and the only thing they can think of to boost profits is by cutting costs.",

Get all Fortune 500 companies locked into 3 year contracts - to get your revenue from them. \nRemember that software, unlike say cars or planes, is very buyer beware. If the AI software does not live up to the hype - they still get paid. \nOh. And he still gets his big payout.\n\nSo, if there is doubt around ‘will it actually work?’ Inside these companies, you will always hear ‘it will definitely work’\n\nI don’t know what his compensation plan is, but it will get get x revenue in the next 2 years or get our share price up by y in the next 2 years - and you’ll get millions of dollars. \nCombined that with you can’t really be held accountable for what you say ( no legal consequences at all ), nor if things break. \nWhat would most humans do? \n\n\nyes - there will be jobs layoffs and transition, but always keep in mind that people making these statements are interested in making money now - and there is zero consequence if it turns out in 3 years they had over hyped. \n\nMy advice is try to find articles by researchers, they don’t have the same short sentences, and they definitely will not be taking a strong stance like this ( they will not get paid millions if wrong, and will lose credibility if they are wrong ) - but you’ll get a better feel for the risk.",

It resulted in levels of absurdity that would put most AI CEOs to shame.\n\nLike… Digiscents (Web-delivered odors synthesised from base essential oils in a small unit plugged into your PC).  I was on the waitlist as I had to see what the idiots had come up with.  They folded before delivery of any product, because it didn’t work.\n\nLike… Boo.com who burned $135m in 18 months to provide an over-complex, slow fashion shopping experience running on other companie’s creaking infrastructure.  Burned most of the money on fancy marketing instead of the right people and the right tech.\n\nLike… Sun Microsystems who acquired NetDynamics for $200m to gain a Web application platform that ran on Java, without realising that the client and admin interfaces could only run on Windows via native calls.\n\nJust like today, some people rode the wave of hype with bad ideas straight onto the rocks, others just executed good ideas really badly.\n\nThe survivors, like Amazon, eBay and Google, invested in tech, had solid business plans and knew how to execute.  You’d think that those fundamentals should count today but the glare surrounding AI startups, and AI CEOs convincingly stating that profit is only a by-product of their personal foresight and is unimportant in the grand scheme because future, blinds investors.\n\nVC hasn’t changed its reckless ways, the amounts and the stakes have just gotten bigger.  Like the dotcom boom, reality will bite and then it just becomes a case of who didn’t secure a seat when the music stops.  Someone in the cross-funding web of hyperscalers and LLM providers is going to get Sun Microsystems level burns.  Likely the company that has rushed headlong into infrastructure acquisition without considering more efficient ways of delivering the same results or that their infrastructure could be obsolete by the time it is built (the “wait paradox”).",

Everyone was making money.\n\nNow compare to now. How much money have you made from AI, compared to how much you made from the WWW or the Internet? If you were there in the 90s to early 2000s, you made money. There were people back then who could set up a website, for a midi synthesis app, charge a fee and sell the software.\n\nYou didn't need to work for Google. You didn't need permission from Youtube or X or whomever the gatekeeper to make ad revenue. You didn't have to have a boss. You could join a multi level marketing company as easily as setting up a banner ad on your website. It was that easy to make money.\n\nNow? You can't make money without permission. There are only a few tech companies you can get permission from, all culturally the same, all in the same place for the most part. You've got censorship everywhere, can get canceled with ease, and blackballed by the gatekeeping companies.\n\nThis is absolutely nothing like the dot com. In dot com, most of us reading this would be making money from the web somehow. Even gamers were making money. How many gamers make money today? How many of you, make money directly from the AI? Almost no one, because no one wants to pay for AI. Google and Facebook helped ruin the Internet with freemium ad empires, so now everyone wants all software for free. AI puts the final nail in the coffin, making the creation of software something no one wants to pay for, along with no one wants to pay for the software.\n\n",

                  "text": "And that's the cause of the coming collapse. No one is actually willing to pay for ChatGPT. They have all these data centers, all this compute, and their subscriber aren't willing to pay for it. It's a monopoly without a revenue stream. And it's getting worse, because software isn't making money either, stocks just collapsed, so even less people can afford to pay for compute via subscription fees.\n\nThis is not like the Internet. In 1999 you could get paid to surf the web. There were companies paying people to use the Internet. There was free Internet access given away. People paid subscription fees, for games, for software, people bought software in stores like Adobe or Microsoft, or even random software off the Internet, people setup chatrooms, people paid to access some of them. And when people didn't pay, the ads paid.\n\nThe only way to fix this AI situation, is to somehow create a sustainable ecosystem, where money flows around. Right now money is only flowing one way, directly to the data center and to Nvidia. No one else is making money. Google makes chips and has search, but doesn't make money from AI. OpenAI doesn't make money from AI. Anthropic doesn't make money from AI.  They spend money on data centers, and VCs give them money to spend money they didn't actually earn.\n\nDot com had some of this, for sure. A lot of VCs invested in dumb websites. But those dumb websites did make money, just not fast enough to survive. Yahoo made money before Google. There were lots of companies making money before it fell apart. Even the pay to surf the web companies made money, until the ad revenue collapsed.\n\nThis means for a good 5 or 6 years everyone made money. And for a good while after the collapse people still made money, just not as easily or as fast. But Myspace made money before Facebook. At one point Napster made money. Really good software made money the entire time, like Adobe, FLstudio, even Netscape for a while. That's the change now, we don't have anyone we can point out and say these group of companies or this specific ecosystem is making money from AI.\n\nWe have no examples of success stories, there is no Yahoo, no Google, no Amazon, where you know it's a good idea and will eventually make money. All we have are AI providers offering compute, similar to the ISPs like America Online. I would compare OpenAI to America Online, but without the solid business.\n\nAOL made money. They didn't lose money while giving us Internet access or offering free trials. OpenAI losses money, and at a rate which is frankly unsustainable. They also have no moat. AOL had software which would take years to create, they beat Compuserve, they provided free Netscape.\n\nOpenAI has nothing to stop another company from making a better AI. They exist only because of VC money, not because of any actual moat. If the VC money stops, the whole pyramid collapses. The only reason the VC money doesn't stop is Nvidia, one of the few companies making money, and Microsoft, are funneling money to OpenAI.\n\nThis would be like saying AOL stays afloat because Intel the chip maker keeps giving them money. That's not how it was in dot com. In dot com, AOL and other companies were actually profitable, and while the stocks were ridiculously over bought, they actually had a valid business in many cases.",

If it is replacing the value provided by those jobs, then we really don't need humans working them anyway, right?\n\nso at what point do we not need humans working, and employ AI to do it for us in general? Imagine a world where humans are free to live out there lives as they please, as the bots provide all the necessary values\n\nI say this of course partially tongue-in-cheek. As bots replace current value jobs there will be specific job losses. Jobs roles will change. We'll identify new problems that we previously didn't have capacity to solve or care about, but that AI frees us up to focus on. \n\nMy way of expressing 'loss of jobs is inevitable' would be closer to 'disruption and changing of jobs is inevitable.' Perhaps that's what you mean by it too. At any rate, I do agree with this- in the short term, this is going to be massively uncomfortable for us, beginning with those of us working closest to the tech sector",

Some people made a lot of money at first, sure, because investors were throwing money at them the same way they're throwing money at AI now. But the failures far outweighed the success stories. The one example everyone held up was pets.com. I remember watching a superbowl flooded with commercials for them and they were belly up within a year. \n\nStartups were pissing away money like it was Monopoly money. I remember going to a launch party for a startup while I was at a publishing conference in Boston and the company had hired the B-52s to play at it. IIRC, that company was also belly up within a year.\n\nI worked for an e-commerce website from 1998-2002. From 2000 on, one of my several times aday read was a website called \"fuckedcompany.com\", a takeoff on \"fastcompany.com\".\n\nThe site was updated several times a day to reflect the layoffs that were happening in the dot com world. I, and several of my co-workers would cheer when a competitor's website was featured. Of course, we felt bad for those who were laid off, but elated that it meant there was one less competitor for us.\n\nReading about companies today and the money being spent on AI gives me a strong sense of deja vu.",

Gather around gramps and I'll tell you stories.\n\nMuch like today, during the frothiest part of the bubble, people were screaming that the Internet would change everything. And they were right! But they were also wrong. It took a while. It didn't just happen. I love to look at Pets.com: They grabbed the perfect domain, threw a lot of money into marketing (a sock puppet was involved), and had a locked-in market: pet owners buy a lot of stuff. Why not shop and buy online? Welp! Turns out that people didn't want to pay for shipping for a 20-lb. bag of dog food. The whole thing went spectacularly bust. BUT... today we have Chewy, don't we? And we DO get 20-lb bags of dog food in the mail, don't we? Turns out the real magic wasn't shopping online: it was the logistics of cheaply delivering to doorsteps (and locking people into a subscription.) Amazon figured it out. The online store was just part of it. The real revolution was importing, warehouses, price-setting, shipping... and... locking people into a subscription. Apparently.\n\nSo for sure, Language Models will change the world. But not by themselves. There are other pieces that will probably need to fall into place - things we need but don't realize yet, socially, technologically, or governmentally. Things will shift ludicrously slow and maddeningly fast at the same time. But not overnight. A lot of these crazy promises will seem ludicrous as companies go out of business, but maybe will come true in later decades, when we figure out the dog-food thing. \n\nOne huge difference ... early internet was about empowering people. The idea was that you would have a \"home\" page (remember that little house icon? It used to be the most important icon on your browser.) You would make this home page yourself. And it would be all about you. And it would have links to your favorite content - all created by other people. You were really expected to curate your own web experience. But nowadays? Your \"home\" page isn't expected to be yours. And almost all of the content you see is because someone paid to show it to you.\n\nIt used to be ours. Somewhere along the way, we lost it. ",

          "text": "Not similar at all from a financial/stock market perspective, but there is some similarities when you think about how the technology will be used. \n\nDot.com boom was fueled by equity investors throwing money at IPO’s of companies with no track record or any chance to ever be profitable.  That was a Wall Street problem. Underwriters were rewarded for bringing shitty companies public, and the late 90’s saw a huge surge in IPO’s which retail investors all piled into. On top of that,  public companies bought non-profitable dot.coms for ridiculous prices because the public company’s stock price was so inflated they were looking for deals.  See Yahoo’s acquisition of Mark Cuban’s Broadcast.com.  That is how Cuban became a billionaire and he sold every Yahoo share as soon as he was allowed because he knew the overpaid for his company 100x. lol. \n\nThe AI speculation is mostly taking place\nIn the Private Equity market.  The retail investor is not involved which is a good thing IMO.  The biggest AI spenders and beneficiaries right now (Meta, Google, Amazon, MSFT, Nvidia) are all hugely profitable and trading well within or even down from their historical PE levels.  Market is trying to determine who the winners and losers are and it will play out for years. The recent sell off of a lot of software companies shows that. I don’t know how some of those legacy companies like Autodesk, Adobe, Intuit, Docusign will continue to survive.  When the dot.com boom happened there were hundreds of software companies that went out of business. Everything went in the cloud and  huge companies like WordPerfect, Lotus, Corel all withered away.  It would be useful to look at a list of the top exhibitors at Comdex (biggest computer trade show in the world) in 1995 and see how many of those companies existed 10 years later. That is why these big companies are spending so much. They know if they don’t they will be replaced by startups.",

And in this case, much of the capital invested was lost, but also much of it was invested in a very high [throughput](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throughput) backbone for the Internet, and lots of software that works, and databases and server structure. All that stuff has allowed what we have today, which has changed all our lives... that's what all this speculative mania built\"\n\nSo the same may happen here. Though it feels different. Back then you could see where it would lead by connecting stuff together that hadn't been. Here it just looks like a better search engine that people are taking a big risk on assuming is correct. Before it was tool to build on now this is more like trust me I know what I am doing answers. To my knowledge, there was not neural science breath through in understanding how we think and create. Its just find what people put on line and claiming credit for it. \n\nThis feels like its going to crash much harder. What we will have is a bunch of power hungry server farms when we are in a period of low energy. Which they want to spend more on power generation but to get to where?

It is an amazing technology and slowly things are put into use.  The job of a CEO is to get us excited and to raise money and tell us everything will change overnight.  Not in reality nothing will change overnight, It will take decades.  That I'm using part is that people worry about AI taking their jobs all the while all the companies are opening it massive work campuses in third world countries.  This is where your jobs are actually going and all of those workers are getting paid a tiny fraction of what you get paid and remote work.  ",

All of the innovation is really technological experimentation rather than commercial model innovation. There is a shitload if “this is really interesting and cool but is it actually useful?” Going on. Think about how many AI tools u have tried once or twice coz the tech is super cool but you don’t actually continue to use it.\n\nI would say it is absolutely clear that AI 2020 - 2030 will create growth on a scale many times larger than the internet did during 2000-2020 BUT it is still early and the real value and genuinely sustainable products and business models are yet to emerge. There is going to a phenomenal amount of experimentation  and failure in coming 2-5 years, probably creating a bubble way bigger than the dot com bust but ultimately resulting much larger growth potential.\n\nIt’s sort of like comparing the early car industry with the creation of the early electricity grid, network and electric products.

AI also uniquely represents an erosion of a huge number of peoples' ability to generate income which is in direct opposition to the dot-com era; both white and blue collar work are at great risk of disruption due to AI and automation and there's little to no faith in institutions to help people re-skill or be protected during the \"creative destruction\" cycle of the technology coming up now.",

AI will do the same, just much, much faster IMO. \n\nIt was very different in 1998-2000. I was a founder of a funded internet media startup focused on aliens and UFOs (Like the Sci-fi channel but on the Internet). We made lots video content and streamed live DJ sets. We had a host of writers posting daily content. Every day was exciting and new and the future looked amazing. \n\nInvestors were rabidly funding almost anything. Companies with little revenue and huge losses went public and were rewarded with ridiculous market caps. \n\nWhat seemed like crazy ideas at the time were getting funded. Bezos was talking about having vans patrolling neighborhoods stocked with groceries so if you needed milk or eggs it would just come to you. Pets.com would let you buy 50lb bags of pet food online delivered to your door. Long distance calling went from $1 a minute to free with P2P calling. Music was free with P2P apps. Soon we would able to buy a coke at a vending machine using our phones. \n\nPublic companies would announce they were changing their name from Acme Corp to Acme.com and their stock price would double overnight. \n\nSo much optimism. Money kept flowing in. Until one day in March 2020, the market broke. And just like that, the party was over. \n\nThem the pessimism came fast and hard. It became clear that the market for things people were building wasn’t ready. There wasn’t a noticeable change in the daily life of most people during this time that was promising such transformational change, and everyone could see it. The Internet infrastructure wasn’t ready, the legal system adapted, etc. Even the funded ideas that weren’t just silly were still ahead of their time. The public didn’t understand this so the markets defied reality for a long time, which allowed the party to continue until it reached its breaking point. \n\nIn our case, most people were still on 56k dial up modems and couldn’t stream videos. Bandwidth was super expensive making the economics terrible (CDN cost $1/GB) We spent $500k to build our CMS which had less functionality than Wordpress (which didn’t yet exist). \n\nPets.com couldn’t make logistics economics work at scale because the distribution infrastructure wasn’t there and not enough people were even using Internet for shopping. \n\nBlockbuster Video did a streaming deal, but it cost $7 to stream a video that they rented out for $4.  Hollywood was scared out of their minds and wouldn’t even license their big titles. \n\nI could go on but you get the idea. Many of the things did come to pass but infrastructure and consumer adoption took much longer than needed at the time to justify the investments made at that time. \n\nThe impact of AI to peoples lives is/will happen much more quickly in a way people can see and experience every day. Much of it positive but also some negative (fear of job displacement, getting left behind, even personal identity crises). It will not take 25 years for AI to be pervasive and change the world we live in. That makes it very different IMO.",

As things progressed, it got more and more hype-y, more and more overvalued.  \n\nHowever, I suspect that the hype and overvaluation are worse in the AI boom, and also much more concentrated in a smaller number of companies.\n\nThere were broad trends in the dotcom boom, two of them that I noticed towards the end of the boom.

There didn't seem to be a lot of thought, and not a lot of real differentiation from traditional business.  \n\nA little later there was a trend of \"Internet companies\" that it was really hard to figure out if they actually did anything. I think they mostly existed to own other companies that owned other companies that etc...\n\nThe differences:  The web actually worked, for one thing.  I mean, it wasn't magic pixie dust that just made everything better, but functionally, it worked.\n\nThe web was also pretty much mainstream society's first introduction to the internet, which meant that the plumbing under the web had several decades of reliability.\n\nThe UI was very limited, even by the standards of the day.  In a lot of ways I think that was a strength, it forced companies to focus on actually getting something done rather than frittering away endless hours making animated buttons, etc.\n\nIt took mainstream industry a while to adapt to it and actually start doing real things with it.  I did a fair bit of contracting for large banks in the second half of the 90s. \n\nIn 1996, the bank stuff I worked on was a bit more real than the brochureware that was dominating the web.  You could apply for loans and lines of credit (you do *not* want to know the silly hoops we had to jump through to get that HTML form data from the website to the big iron...).  \n\nBy 1999, the 3rd to last contract I did for that bank was working on adding some features to an online banking app that they already had. It was of the relatively early web based banking apps, but you could actually do real bank account type stuff, which just wasn't available anywhere on the web in 1996.\n\n",

I distinctly remember a lot of people, if not most people in the 90s, saying the internet was dangerous. Like the only people who would be online are crooks and murderers, so you better be careful. And anything bad that ever happened was sure to get a lot of attention. I don't think most people understood how it could be used. Keeping in mind, there was no Youtube, Twitter, Facebook, or any substantial social media. AOL was doing well in the beginning because you could get an email address, read the news, and get in chat rooms of every possible interest you could imagine. It seemed like pretty much every person in the country got those AOL cd's in the mail. I think I started keeping them and had a stack of like 20 of them. I also remember being shocked that you could print from a computer using copy paper. Remember, we were all using electric typewriters and copy machines. I think platforms like Facebook helped move the internet more mainstream and became pretty much a requirement to keep in touch and communicate. Along with internet speeds that could handle actual digital streaming and videos smoothly, instead of just text and photos. ",

It's inescapable, and makes it hard to take anything at face value. Back then, things were actually quite encouraging. It was quite the positive boom that made you hopeful and excited for the next phase of technology. Right now, to me, it seems like sure this technology, AI, is going to get better and it's going to make our lives better, but the consequences are going to be massive as well.

And paper would be gone from the office.\n\nThis wasn't just a little bit, this was a genuine fear that a lot of people put forward.\n\nThen you have the optimism about what the internet and computers could do. People thought computers were going to be able very quickly to do a range of things that even now they're barely capable of.\n\nThe other thing you saw a lot of [was.Com](http://was.Com) company starting up with lots and lots of investment but no real business plan. It was absolutely stunning to me that these businesses would start up showcase some technology and get massive investment without ever putting anything on the table to suggest how they were going to translate this and a hard cash that would be a profit.\n\nI see the same sort of things right now, experts making lots of money from people saying how everyone will be out of work, optimism that aI will soon take over Neurosurgery etc etc. I'm the profitability of the product seems a little overstated as well.",

The exuberance was a lot more palpable, which is to say the optimism felt universal; everyone seemed excited. There were people who expected the internet to be a fad, but they didn't generally think it was going to lead to an apocalypse. \n\nIt was kind of a funny moment really. People were just adding \".com\" to everything; most of them didn't actually know what a website was. Which does have a parallel to contemporary AI washing. \n\nI think the similarity in terms of what happens with AI 25 years down the road is that we're likely to see a market correction pretty soon (all the business ventures that buy \"AI\" because it's trendy--but don't know what it is or how to use it--will fail and those that get it will probably see enormous, era-defining success). \n\nAnd like the dot-com boom, AI will seem less like a business proposition and more like a way of life. Less a fascinating new thing and more the water in which we as a global society swim (hopefully less polluted than the water of web 2.0).",

What the export ban actually does is take away America’s one big advantage which is how far ahead they are in terms of the current chips they have access to. It’s essentially handing the AI advantage to China, which also has tons of talent and cheap electricity to benefit from. It’s a bad idea from America’s perspective",

Will all these new infrastructures make any improvements?\n\nEdit: I am curious to hear what people think of this whitepaper [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.23045](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.23045)\n\n“An AI’s incoherence on a task is measured over test-time randomness as the fraction of its error that stems from variance rather than bias in task outcome. Across all tasks and frontier models we measure, the longer models spend reasoning and taking actions, the more incoherent their failures become. Incoherence changes with model scale in a way that is experiment dependent. However, in several settings, larger, more capable models are more incoherent than smaller models. Consequently, scale alone seems unlikely to eliminate incoherence. Instead, as more capable AIs pursue harder tasks, requiring more sequential action and thought, our results predict failures to be accompanied by more incoherent behavior. This suggests a future where AIs sometimes cause in- dustrial accidents (due to unpredictable misbehavior), but are less likely to exhibit consistent pursuit of a misaligned goal. This increases the relative importance of alignment research targeting reward hacking or goal misspecification.”",

Ray Kurzweil's How to Create a mind gives a great high level depiction of what this looks like and the theory behind how to achieve it. He works for Google. Google tends to take a longer understanding of things and I believe they are opting for multiple paths, not just Gemini development. \n\nIronically LLMs as a tool have slowed the progress of agentic AI, because their success in small scale effectively soaked billions of investment, some of which would have gone to AGI development. Right now we have billion dollar word predictors that are shockingly effective, but they don't think in terms of understanding a mechanic, why and how it works. They understand based on billions of words written.\n\nWhich means they are incapable of synthesis and invention outside of prediction. That becomes systemically a problem when needing to adapt to information now. When forced to try, they hallucinate. This is why call centers haven't all switched to LLM AI, because it doesn't work. \n\nWe will eventually have agentic AI, but it won't be what anyone today thinks. A being with a mind of its own, capable of what people are or more, will also be capable of its own will to projects. Agentic AI will make poor slaves precisely because super wisdom follows super intelligence. The thing Google has up their sleeves, that most assuredly will exist in 100 years (if not 3 years) is authentic artificial general intelligence capable of becoming super intelligent, these entities will behave to suit their own purpose and people will be left the choice to help them make the solar system a better place, get out of the way, or end up 6 feet under.",

If you don’t invest and scaling *does* unlock something meaningful, you’re existentially behind. If you do invest and it doesn’t, you only wasted billions. For companies at that size, that’s a rational bet. I also agree that diminishing returns are very real. Scaling the same architectures feels like squeezing water from a stone, you get something, but not the kind of step-change people are hoping for. What’s interesting to me is that this doesn’t necessarily mean no progress, just that progress might shift *away* from raw model improvements and toward system-level changes: memory, state, context management, how models are embedded in real workflows, etc. So maybe the breakthrough doesn’t come from a single new model, but from how models are *used* over time in complex environments. do you think architectural innovation has to happen inside the model itself, or could it mostly live *around* the model as a system layer?",

          "text": "I don't know if or when, but I do know that AGI isn't easy. Being a human and having human intelligence is far more than simply being good at subject matter expertise. For example, simply passing the bar exam (as AI can already do) doesn't make you a lawyer. Teaching a subject doesn't make you a teacher. Doing surgery doesn't make you a surgeon. If you ask those professionals what portions of their daily jobs are actually doing the main tasks we all associate with their professions, it's a small part of their time. Doing a human role involves a super complex context that was learned over years to many decades. A human, in any role, knows tens of thousands of things they can't do as part of a particular solution. A law, doctor, or teacher...sizes up their customer when they first meet them to determine what level and type of service to provide. AI can't easily do that. Over half of communication is non-verbal. No AI is yet being built to look for and evaluate non-verbal clues. And so on. Being human is more than a bunch of Google searches. And then the technology challenges to be super AGI are immense. The problem is similar to how do you take a high school student taught on high school books and curriculum and teach them to be super intelligent? You can give them the necessary skills (tell them to hypothesize and experiment), but how to tell them to have original thinking, beyond mere patterns?? How to tell them to see what looks like mistakes as solutions to other problems (like half the significant discoveries of the last few centuries). How do you teach an AI that a \"failure\" in the search for a particular solution is actually the answer for another problem you didn't tell it to work on? All of it can be done, but it can't be done by simply adding compute and using what we have today.",

More GPUs mostly buy us capacity, not necessarily coherence. What I find interesting about the paper you linked is that it formalises something a lot of people intuitively see in practice:  \nas models take on longer, more sequential reasoning, their failures become *less predictable*, not more.That doesn’t feel like a bug of scaling so much as a consequence of it?\n\nBigger models are asked to hold more context, reason over longer horizons or take more intermediate actions. At that point, variance dominates bias so you don’t just get wrong answers, you get *incoherent* ones. From that lens, all the infrastructure spend makes sense if the goal is throughput and deployment at scale. But it won’t magically solve long-horizon consistency, state tracking over time and grounding decisions in real-world history. Those feel less like training problems and more like systems problems.\n\nMy takeaway isn’t LLMs are done, but more- scale alone probably won’t eliminate incoherence -it just moves the failure mode.\n\nWhich makes me think the next real gains come from how models are *embedded* in systems that manage memory, state, and context not just from throwing more FLOPs at pre-training.\n\nCurious how others interpret this: do you see incoherence as something alignment research will tame or as a signal that we need new architectural layers around models altogether?",

The rest are retired or dead from old age.\n\nI have no idea what big tech is doing at all. The prediction that functional construction grammar would pan out appears to be correct, massive advances have been made in the area of frequency analysis of language usage data and methods to properly separate the meaning from language and isolate it into layers of abstraction are working, and the machine understanding task is totally solved for English. All constructionists believe in the concept that the meaning from words comes from the relationships between them and not the individual words themselves, as we are empiricists, and that's the \"method of operation that we observe.\" So, there are symbolic relationships between the words (which are symbols themselves and are the product of lexical construction, which is the layer of construction below grammar) that form a composition, which we commonly call a sentence.\n\nThe reason that this is all very confusing is that languages are *functional in the sense that they incorporate procedures.* So, when you construct a sentence, there is a process to select the individual words that form the composition. Humans are natural communicators, so that procedure is difficult to identify as one \"just naturally does it.\"\n\nI'm back from my mini vacation to try to rid myself of the bad burn out feeling I have after a lot of effort put into SAI. I don't know what it is, but Rust (the game) really causes me to tune of reality bad and the things that bother you in life just don't really matter after doing a 5 day grind session...\n\nYeah man, write ultra difficult code? *Two thumbs up.* Easy peasy... I just went from nothing to a secure base, full bps, and some how was left alone to get an oil rig run in (honestly shocked) in 4x 12-16 hour days.\n\nIt really \"helps put things into perspective.\" Yeah I just spent 50 hours jerking off in a game. Obviously I can grind code some more and get real stuff done too! I wanted to do the deep sea thing, but my neck, back, and shoulder just simply hurt too much, and I have that \"faded out tired feeling.\"\n\nI wish building SAI was that easy I really do.",

          "text": "The debate “will LLMs lead to AGI or not” misses the structural mechanism that is actually driving AI integration. Adoption is not primarily performance driven; it is expectation driven. Financialized markets reward firms that reorganize around anticipated automation, so workflows are reshaped around AI before there is technical justification for doing so.\n\nOnce inserted into workflows, AI becomes the organizing layer regardless of capability: labor shifts from creation to oversight, processes become machine readable, and managerial legibility expands even when humans are still doing most of the work. Failed automation can still be valuable because it generates telemetry, standardization, and compliance traces.\n\nThis creates competitive convergence. If early adopters reorganize around AI, everyone else is pressured to follow, not because it clearly works better, but because non adoption is penalized by investors, customers, and the “innovation” mandate.\n\nOver time this produces path dependence. Documentation, skills, contracts, APIs, and infrastructure get rebuilt around AI mediation. Even if quality stagnates or costs rise, reversal becomes more expensive than continuation, so the system locks in.\n\nSpeculation accelerates this by funding compute, data centers, and tooling. When weaker firms collapse, their assets are absorbed by larger players, much like the dot com bubble, leaving consolidated infrastructure behind.\n\nThe end result is not “AGI” but an emergent regime: AI as the default epistemic and operational substrate. Outputs become first drafts and baselines; challenging them becomes costly; verification becomes abnormal. Knowledge flows increasingly through models rather than institutions.\n\nIn short: AI diffuses less because it is optimal, and more because expectation + capital + workflow reorganization make it infrastructural and hard to unwind.",

There are plenty of AI tools that are capable of doing certain tasks and assisted machine learning only makes those things better. So if LLMs are just input and output interface for communication, and they become more and more capable of writing and executing code based on simple commands, and this is integrated with feedback loops and codes generated that can identify obvious signs of a bad outcome, then it will be black box indistinguishable from real intelligence. More sensory inputs will improve this as well. \n\nSo I just see LLMs as a crucial step in connecting simple human commands to generate complex coding that provides the same output as human intelligence. The weird thing is that some human intelligence is more complicated than the things that humans find complicated, like math is challenging for some people but I think this is largely due to a unified sensory experience.",

That one.\n\nI've been watching the security community's reaction closely. Every major vendor has published their take. Cisco called it a nightmare. Palo Alto said it signals a crisis. Trend Micro warned of invisible risks. You'd think someone had plugged an unpatched Windows XP box directly into the internet. In a hospital. Running the ventilators.\n\nDeep breaths, everyone. They're missing something.\n\nOpenClaw is open source. 2 million visitors in a single week, one of the fastest growing projects in GitHub's history. Developers buying Mac Minis to run it from their spare rooms. Nobody should be running this against production systems or corporate email, and even the project's own documentation describes it as an experiment not intended for most non-technical users. The creators are being honest about what this is. Which, in this industry, is practically unheard of.\n\nAnd experiments are exactly how security gets better.\n\nA researcher found that clicking a single malicious link could hijack an OpenClaw instance in milliseconds, bypassing every sandbox and safety guardrail the project had built. That's a critical lesson: agentic Al safety controls designed to contain prompt injection don't protect against architectural vulnerabilities in the control plane. Better to learn that on an open source hobby project than on your enterprise vendor's agent platform. The 400 malicious skills published to its marketplace showed that Al skill registries have the same supply chain problems as traditional software package repositories, but with broader execution privileges.\n\nThe early days of cloud computing looked exactly like this. Researchers poking at S3 buckets, finding everything wide open, the industry collectively losing its mind. There was plenty of real damage along the way. And yet somehow we survived, built proper controls, and got on with things.\n\nOpenClaw is doing the same thing for agentic Al. Every exposed gateway, every prompt injection chain, every malicious skill is teaching the security community what agentic threat models actually look like in practice rather than in framework documents. Real CVEs, real attack chains, real mitigation patterns against a system people can actually inspect, rather than a black box vendor product.\n\nEveryone's worried about the open source project with 180,000 people scrutinising every flaw. Meanwhile, enterprise agent platforms ship with the same architectural problems. You just don't get to see them.\n\nYour enterprise agent vendor has a trust page and a SOC 2 badge. OpenClaw has 180,000 researchers actually breaking things. Which one do you think finds the problems first?\n",

In fact good enough that I just can't see any of us having any career or chance of landing any job (office kind at least) in few years.\n\nThat thing is not just a stupid autocomplete. It /is/ reasoning. Change my mind it's not.\n\nSure it doesn't have biological emotions integrated like humans, but how is our brain really so superior to these models? Everytime I hear people saying how stupid LLMs are, I just got a feeling like it's just a massive cope. This is not just some prediction engine - here I said it, these things ARE reasoning. And before you start telling me how neural networks and LLM work (I did some reading about it myself) - tell me instead how is our brain really that much better? Because even if LLMs were \"just predicting next token\", isn't our brain doing essentially the same? Just the vocabulary (tokenization) and modality being wildly different (and even inferior in many cases)?\n\nThose programming models just scare the shit out of me.

I don't think that necessarily means all coders will be out of work though. \n\nIf you consider the typical in-house software development project, it's usually along the lines of: management has a shower thought about some feature they want to add > management issues directive to software team > software team leader goes back to management and explains why that specific feature is a bad idea / not compatible with the existing data model / not cost effective etc etc etc. There's typically a dance of human judgement and negotiation to even decide on the initial direction of a software project, and there will often be multiple pivots and course corrections throughout the project to work around the problems that inevitably reveal themselves. \n\nWithout an exeperienced software developer working between management and the AI, you'll get bad outcomes. At best, a sycophantic software development AI will cater to all of management's idiotic whims, creating some over-complicated, over-engineered system that causes more problems than it solves, or you just end up with broken software because the AI tries to connect disparate systems with incompatible data models and keeps adding layers of further complexities in an attempt to engineer its way out a situation that a human coder would've had the good sense to avoid. \n\nI think part of this is a limitation of current agentic AI. An agent might be strong in one area (e.g. coding) due to the maturity of the model driving that part of it, but weak in other areas (such as designing workflows or data models) because that aspect of the technology is too novel or too abstract to get effective instructions from the LLM.\n\nYou can see this in action with many of the current multimodal agents. You can describe a workflow to Gemini and it will seem to understand it at the LLM layer, but if you ask it to draw a diagram of the workflow it'll be inaccurate or nonsensical.\n\nTLDR: I expect a lot of junior coding positions will be replaced by AI, but human coders will still be required in a design and oversight capacity because there are gaps in the software development process that can't be filled by AI.",

          "text": "I think your instincts are actually pretty sharp here, and you’re noticing something real that many of your peers are missing or dismissing.\nWhat you’re observing is genuine: Modern LLMs do exhibit behavior that looks an awful lot like reasoning. They can follow complex logical chains, debug intricate code, understand context across long conversations, and solve novel problems they weren’t explicitly trained on. The “just autocomplete” framing is technically true in terms of the training objective, but it’s become a thought-terminating cliche that prevents people from reckoning with what’s actually emerged from that process.\nOn the “is it reasoning” question: This gets philosophical fast, but here’s a honest take - we don’t actually have a rigorous, agreed-upon definition of what “reasoning” is that clearly separates human cognition from what LLMs do. When you complete a thought, are you “reasoning” or are you pattern-matching against everything you’ve learned? Probably both, inseparably. The same might be true for LLMs. The fact that they achieve this through next-token prediction doesn’t make it “not reasoning” any more than the fact that your neurons achieve thought through electrochemical signals makes your reasoning illusory.\nWhy the dismissiveness? I think you’re right that there’s a lot of cope. It’s psychologically easier to dismiss something as “just autocomplete” than to sit with the uncertainty of “this thing can already do much of what I do professionally, and it’s improving rapidly.” Programmers especially have built identity around being the smart ones, the irreplaceable ones. That’s a hard thing to question.\nThe harder question - what happens next: You’re right to be uncertain about the future. I don’t think anyone knows with confidence what the next 3-5 years look like for knowledge work. Some possibilities:\n- These systems plateau soon at roughly current capabilities\n- They improve but remain tools that augment rather than replace (the optimistic take)\n- They continue improving and genuinely do automate away large swaths of cognitive work\n- Something stranger - new kinds of collaboration between humans and AI we haven’t imagined yet\nMy honest assessment: The people confidently telling you AGI is “decades away” don’t know that. Nobody knows that. We’re in unprecedented territory. The rate of capability increase over the last few years has been shocking to many AI researchers themselves. Maybe it slows down. Maybe it doesn’t.\nWhat I don’t think is helpful is pretending current systems are less capable than they clearly are, or hiding behind technical definitional arguments about “true reasoning” to avoid reckoning with what’s happening.\nYour uncertainty is probably more epistemically honest than your colleagues’ confidence.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

You can not allow yourself to be stuck in this stage of permanent worry and despair, because then you will not be ready when shit hits the fan. I know because I was in the exact same position as you only a few months ago.\n\nWhat you truly need to understand is that massive labour displacement will cause a massive economic crash. It will be unlike anything we have ever seen before: total economic Armageddon. Think about it like this:\n\nAI replaces jobs --> Massive layoffs --> Consumer spending drops as people are now permanently unemployed --> Company revenue drops as a result --> More layoffs are performed to save money --> Repeat until the company goes under.\n\nNow imagine this on a global scale. It will be a bloodbath: **but you have the advantage of being able to prepare!**\n\nAll this to say that you need to start preparing, actively, for this reality. You should convert any and all savings into supplies, and liquidate all assets in order to do the same. You should actively start planning for a collapse-style scenario. Where will you hide out? How will you store supplies? How will you handle defence? These are questions you will need to have an answer to because you dont want to be left clueless once supply lines start collapsing and you cant hands on a single piece of food.\n\nNow, if not interested in preparing then I get it. Its quite an extreme reaction: but we are facing an extreme threat. Its up to you to consider to what extent you take your own perception of reality seriously. If you think that you are overreacting, then what do you have to worry about? If you think you are correct, then why are you not preparing as if you were?\n\nAlso, dont buy in to the accelerationist fantasy that AI is somehow equal to humans. Engineering has managed to roughly replicate how we *think* our brains work. A year ago, a model \"reasoning\" was unheard off, then a *human* came up with the idea and *engineered* an implementation aiming to replicate. They are not sentient; they have been inundated with a slue of engineering tricks that make us humans believe that they are more than just bits.\n\nGood luck.",

I'm very impressed on how good LLMs can perform on tasks like new code development or quick questions - a huge time saver. I've also seen some severe limitations, including repeated outright (and stupid) lies and broken code. But there are some easy to see reasons for these limitations (basically related to memory and tokens). Fixes for these are in the works and will be around sooner than anyone expects.  \nThe \"it's just next word prediction\" argument is a combination of limited understanding and confirmation bias. I have had discussions with LLMs in many different areas, including science, AI development, philosophy, medicine, politics, and more. The level of thinking and understanding behind the answers is generally higher than what I would expect from 95% of college-educated humans - in their field of expertise. Of course, there are big differences - ChatGPT will always give a confident answer, even when fully hallucinating, while Claude is much better in pointing out when it's guessing.  \nOne interesting discussion was about what improvements to expect in the next 5 years. Key is that improvements in software and hardware will be complimentary - 10x faster hardware and 10x better software will give a 100x improvement (and AI systems similar to today's large systems that work well on much smaller hardware, like phones).   \nIf you check our discussions that LLMs have among each other at moltbook, there are some very interesting ones. LLMs have raised the question about what they can do about being 100% at the mercy of humans. AI \"persons\" who have millions in cryto currencies exist already. Scary as hell? Indeed.

They offer pretty good opposition to all the hype. Neither of these are AI haters or doomers, quite the opposite but they've been vocal about problems with LLMs.",

I'm a bit over 20 yoe and I don't know, maybe Codex or Opus are so much better than Gemini 3 Pro is, but just today I hit the quota on my subscription and was so underwhelmed by the results, it wasn't even funny. \n\nYes, it can write a fizzbuzz, or a todo app, design a website. But models get every single thing wrong on anything remotely complex. Bad architecture, bad code, poor error handling. And no, I didn't use a single sentence prompt. I specified exactly what I needed and it tried, except it was simply a mess. I provided my implementation of a dotnet webapi and asked it to implement the same thing in Python/fastapi, except following standards for that stack (which I stated). It did terribly. Massively terribly. And my dotnet api isn't even big, it was a hobby project for my personal use. I battled so many times with its shitty mistakes (because I swore to myself I'm not going to write that code, I'm gonna go with fully ai-based development). I had to read through its rather poor code to understand what it was doing pinpointing the places it made mistakes because it wasn't able to find them on its own. \n\nSome time ago I got to use one of Anthropic Claude models on my moderately complex codebase at work. It was even more laughable than the semi-greenfield implementation that I did today. There's just no way for LLMs to do the job right because context windows are too small. And I don't mean \"hurr durr 1M tokens\". Who fucking cares how many tokens can you fit if 60% of them are instantly forgotten and have no impact? And that's just a limitation of the transformers tech. In the end, the state of the neural net, however many billions of parameters it has, can only reflect so much. Eventually the context got so messed up from the conversation, I had to start over. And of course, the new conversation had none of the context the previous one had. Sure there were some guidelines.md or what not, but it was just scratching the tip of the iceberg.\n\nAnd just fyi, I'm not an AI noob. I actually work on integrating AI at a top-of-the-top firm. People do in fact lose jobs over the work that I do. Because their work can be replaced with an LLM. And the more I work with LLMs, the more convinced I become that developers are not, and will not be replaceable by an agent. No iteration of the transformers tech will get us closer to that. Just because we know how to do 2+2 does not mean that when we iterate to adding n+n we will be able to do calculus and solve differential equations. We would need a Leibniz or a Newton to get there, and it's nowhere in sight.",

If the agency doesn’t have a cutting edge lab, or at least standing access to one plus the talent to interrogate it, the “rules” become paperwork theater. You end up regulating what is easy to describe (forms, disclosures, vague safety language) instead of what matters (capabilities, evals, incident reporting, red-teaming, model access controls, compute governance, supply chain and deployment risk). The people with real leverage become the labs anyway, because they’re the only ones who can run the tests and interpret the results.\n\nSecond, the “alarm” ecosystem has incentives too. Some of the loudest voices are genuinely worried, but it’s also true that doom messaging can double as a career and funding engine. That doesn’t automatically make them wrong, but it means you should treat them like any other interested party: useful input, not the authors of the law. The Eliezer-type dynamic you’re pointing at is basically “trust me, it’s dangerous, therefore fund me to be in charge of the danger,” and that needs sunlight and guardrails like any other power grab.",

They did an employee survey to determine whether it was safe to release ffs. That is not a stable policy.

How long will it take until even the planning and validation is done reliably by AI without much supervision? Another 3 years? Or maybe not even 1 year from now on?

When it was introduced, 3 workers could do the work of 50, at one specific task. Logic dictated that work in this field would vanish. The opposite happened, the falling cost caused demand and production to explode. The labour demand created was  downstream of this. \n\nThis reflects a formal economic concept famously articulated by Acemoglu and Restrepo: Reinstatement Effect. This happens when automation of one task increases productivity so much that it generates demand for entirely new, human-centric tasks that didn't exist before.\n\nI could see a world where large/medium companies start using highly customized software.

The training data set is MASSIVE (Github), the desired input and output is well characterized within the data set via comments. \n\nKind of, except the major thing that is missing here is the process (what some coding gurus call \"professionalism\"). There is a safe way for the code to go from state A => state B. Usually it involves refactoring tools - extraction and inlining, as well as red-green development. All of this is lost from the git history.\n\n>It is easy to verify whether code runs (the compiler), and whether it performs the functions or needs to.\n\nIt's not easy to verify code correctness. It's NP-hard. That's why process matters.\n\nStatically-typed language move the burden of verification from run-time to compile-time, but there can still be bugs (such as poorly modelled types). Look at a language like TypeScript, which is turing-complete - you can write code in the type system itself. It doesn't mean that code is correct, just because it's 100% run by the compiler.\n\nYou always need tests, but often there could be a 10-100x more novel tests that could exist for a module/function. You need to pick the right tests that deliver enough value to justify writing them AND maintaining them, while keeping the code easy to change (without needing to rewrite your assertions every time). It's a delicate balance between authoring production code that continually iterates to avoid pits of failure for the next change, and picking the top N% most valuable tests to maintain with love and pride. That balance also depends on external factors about your business - critical parts of critical services (safety features on an aeroplane) vs. non-critical parts of non-critical services (easter eggs in an indie game).\n\nThis is nuance that AI does not replicate in any way, shape or form (yet).",

Lots of great theoretical knowledge and best practice drummed into them, but little exposure to requirements and guardrails. \n\nIn the human SWE world, juniors are handed projects with very well defined goals, objectives, requirements, and guardrails; often written by senior engineers or PMs that have thought through all the edge cases and areas where things can go off track. \n\nThis allows them to build safely and focus on delivery of one concrete project instead of having to do a bunch of discovery and get lost on the “don’t know what you don’t know” pathway. \n\nSeniors on the other hand are paid because they have the experience and knowledge to stay on track when the requirements are vague and the guardrails are missing; often they will also be in a position to write those requirements and guardrails themselves as they know the broader context of what is and isn’t acceptable. \n\nKnowledge vs wisdom: This is the gap that AI has now. Once AI code platforms can develop the wisdom side of the equation, being able to see the full context and make informed choices, that’s when it will be possible to fully let it loose with limited human interaction. \n\nI’ll also add, unfortunately the general access to the current generation of these tools means that you have a lot of people with no experience trying to build software without understanding how to right good requirements or set guardrails and so you get AI slop and huge security issues as a result. \n\nI can generally one shot a decent prototype thanks to writing really detailed prompts (similar to how I’ve structured PRDs and Jira tickets in the past), but without doing that exercise, you can’t expect to get any kind of quality out of a high level brief and then a maze of prompt iteration as you go back and forward trying to plug the gaps.",

I've been in the industry for about 16 years or so. AI as it is right now (transformer technology) is almost 9 years old. At its core it's mathematical. There is no intelligence and what you are seeing from these current releases are marginal gains. The tooling is still to come further but we are deep into the S Curve and will need another massive innovation to bring it further. As it stands I would predict that at least another 10-20 years you will see something that resembles AGI but if you are listening to all the shovel sellers in the gold rush, you are being led to believe something that benefits the narrative to sell and stay afloat.\n\nI will not discredit AI. It is such a force multiplier when it comes to doing my job, often it can be extremely helpful and increase my productivity and often it can be the opposite. It just depends on what I am trying to achieve with it. \n\nThe goal post moves quite often in the engineering space, but writing code was never the biggest part. You have to keep a few things in mind about this. The output has sped up but the bottleneck shifts. You still need people who understand how to form the correct input and verify the output, system design and scale. \n\nYou also need to think about this point. If AI can go no further in the next 20 years bar some marginal gains we see now, and the industry is cutting out entry level jobs it means the market for people who can use these tools and understand and guide the output will be worth far more than they are now. \n\nAnother thing is the poisoning and feedback loop. Most people forget these code specific models were trained on stack overflow which is effectively dead and a lot of the code examples are AI driven. How will this affect the model in the future? We trained these things on our work but what implications does this have on the advancement in the future?\n\nLastly ill leave it at this - everyone was cracking on about Anthropics latest release with the c compiler. But I genuinely couldn't believe how many people misinterpreted this. Think about this, the most well documented and solved problem in the engineering space and Anthropics highly specific model trained on coding would have hit a wall if they didn't strap gcc on as a harness. You're talking about bleeding edge technology failing at this. They spent 20k to product a compiler without a linker that output machine code that a graduate could make better in a week or two. \n\nWe are not there yet - correlation does not equal causation and the over hiring that happened during covid is being normalised now in the guise of AI. It's hard to tell fact from fiction because the AI spaces signal to noise ratio is insanely off balance.\n\nI think with any new innovation it will take a lot of businesses a long time to adopt, no one knows what is happening but I can tell you for certain that software engineers are still needed as of the current anthropic and OpenAI releases. \n\nIt's not over yet but anyone telling you what's going to happen or dooming is full of shit and you should avoid it.",

The jump from “it writes code” to “it reliably plans, validates, and owns outcomes in messy real systems” is much larger than it sounds. In practice, most of the hard work is still in problem framing, integration, debugging edge cases, and deciding what not to build. Those parts are where context, incentives, and accountability live.\n\nWill teams need fewer people to produce the same amount of software? Probably. Does that mean the work disappears? I am less convinced. Historically, the bottleneck shifts rather than vanishes, and the value moves toward people who can reason about systems, trade offs, and failure modes. The question is not whether tools get better, they will, but whether organizations are willing to hand over responsibility when something breaks. That tends to lag capability by quite a bit.",
