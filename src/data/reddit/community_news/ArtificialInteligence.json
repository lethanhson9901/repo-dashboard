One of the reasons the shortage occurs is because the work is extremely taxing on the body and you are working in not great environments everyday. If demand drops the skill level desired is going to go up. \n\nAnd as a person who was in commercial construction its very important theres someone who is good at their core trade, usually theres a top level expert with grunts working underneath them, time is what makes you good and every trade owner wants skill. Skill leads to less mistakes, less reworks, less bullshit. \n\nI now work in corporate, and I can only see a couple of people in my division that have what it takes to be in the trades. The majority of them wouldnt be able to hack it.",

They are disorganized, don’t follow up, have terrible customer service skills, look and act like people you wouldn’t want in your home, etc. \n\nIt takes very little time to learn a trade. Far less than most think given that 90% of most trades are the same work over and over again. Building codes and methods have largely been systematized. I have a buddy who is a constantly out-of-work electrician. He blames immigrants but when I ask him how it is that uneducated immigrants can do his job he says it’s because all their work has been dumbed down to the point that it’s like building Lego sets and pretty much anyone can do it. \n\nThe people who own and operate blue collar businesses are going to be in for a rude awakening once the white collar managerial class sees how easy most of the work in the trades is and begins starting these kinds of businesses. The older folks in the trades who’ve been allowed to be unprofessional for so long will be the first to go. They will be replaced by younger workers who will be trained differently and these companies will quickly surpass the more established companies with bad business habits. \n\nNow, don’t get me wrong. While 90% of blue collar work is “easy” there’s still a need for master level workers and those folks will still get coddled. But by and large the trades are going to see major disruption once the managerial class is forced to work in these fields.",

And anywhere where certifications are not required, or are easy to come by, labour supply will skyrocket extremely fast.\n\nTaking myself as a (perhaps not entirely representative, but also certainly not outlier) example, I'm an office worker. I have a mixed computer science and life sciences background, so although my focus today is in systems theory and ML/AI, over the years I also ended up learning how to grow human tissue in a lab environment, operate and troubleshoot mass spectrometers (and a handful of less complex machines) and build custom microfluidic setups, various bits of organic and inorganic chemistry, etc.. In my free time, I've been building computers and soldering stuff for over 20 years.

You can now watch a video on how to do that, which is way better than some boring no picture Chilton car repair book. Also, there's going to be new online tools where car repair shops will bid for your business.  And those online tools will be using AI to get the prices optimal for customers.  So yes accountants may not do electrical work in their house but there's a lot of other things they can do in their house.  And, most importantly Electrician students now can use AI to learn things more easily.  So even the pros will be using AI and that will mean more supply and when there's more labor supply prices tend to go down.\n\nCase in point. I'm changing my rear tail light this weekend.

You can’t just pivot in a few months and compete with someone who’s been doing it for 10 years.\n\nWhat I *do* think happens is pressure across the board: tighter budgets, more competition, more cost-cutting. Nobody is fully insulated. We see the same thing in our line of safety, manufacturing, and compliance inspection work. Even when tools get smarter, real-world constraints, regulations, and physical risk keep humans in the loop. So yeah, AI affects more than just “office jobs,” but the ripple effects are probably slower and messier than a sudden collapse.",

That's the problem it's untrained it takes five years of some form of apprenticeship to reach journeyman status in nonunion or union setting. Some states have lower standards, but in return any trade requiring licenses often have no reciprocity agreements. Meaning a Texas electrician or plumber or HVAC guy can't legally go to Washington and start doing their trade. States like Wisconsin require their plumbers and electricians (anything with a license really) to go through a pretty solid 5 year schooling program.\n\nSo it's not like these people will just magically be integrated into the trades and boom every market is saturated. Roofing, insulators, laborers, yeah they'll probably get saturated, but honestly those trades aren't really for the weak so not everyone is going to make it coming from an office job. Then Commercial construction isn't just stores, and restaurants it's hospitals, schools so yeah that might slow down but those never stop. There's also industrial which can go from warehouses to factories, to nuke plants etc etc again those may slow down, but they never stop. Just because residential would take a hit doesn't mean it would also affect the other aspects. There's infrastructure as well.",

The risk isn’t transitions, it’s a massive amount of cheap young labor going into those fields at a young age and flooding in and creating over supply in most major metros. That will mean anyone who isn’t a business owner or entrenched in a union is shit out of luck.\n\nThis is still all irrelevant because every semi imperial number and survey we have still says that Americans overwhelmingly do not want to do trades or manual labor and it will probably take much bigger changes in the work force than AI has done yet to convince them otherwise.",

There's a reason most job applications call for 2-4 even 6 years of experience. Like you can have a technician work on Ford motors and Ford cars all his life. But the moment you bring let's say a Mercedes or a Honda in front of them. They don't know how to work on it (they were never a good tech. They were a part swapper) All the engines work fundamentally the same way, but let's say Honda for their VTEC uses hydraulic pressure with your oil and actually changes the camshaft rockers itself while in a BMW instead of changing the camshafts they use some kind of mechanism in between the lifters and the camshaft and has nothing to do with the rockers. They both fundamentally operate in the same way but they're completely different systems and it takes time to learn the difference. I'm not saying I'm the best tech because I can work on both motors. There's a lot of things I don't know but I will say there's a lot of things I do know and I'm sorry My diagnostic skills and my ability to talk to my customers will definitely keep me in business over someone who just got into the career, especially as a mechanic. You got to be good at explaining how something works to someone with no experience. That's not the fault of the consumer driver. Whatever it's the fault of the damn company that makes these complicated motors. They don't need to be this complicated. They got to have a certain thism to keep up with all the bull they be putting in it. And if you want to know the difference between Honda's VTEC and Mercedes advance valve control or whatever they call it, Honda uses the the camshaft rockers and the lobe stays the same except when you go above 5000 RPM or something. I can't remember exact your oil pump adds enough pressure to push a pin through the rockers. There's one set that's normal for a fuel efficiency and another set that opens both the intake and exhaust valves for more air and to flow better turning your little 4 before banger into a race 4 banger And BMW does the same thing except it's electronically controlled through an actuator. No hydraulic fluids and it has this weird Goofy system to mechanically change said rockers fundamentally the same but one's more reliable (Honda) and the other not so much. But if you ask a BMW dealership they'll say it's just normal wear and tear, 😭🫩",

I work at an asphalt/diesel terminal.

And there's a massive difference between moving your body 5-10 hours a week and doing it 40-60 hours a week physically speaking. \n\nSecond, automation will take over mundane trade skills that you can use on repeat. But the ability to fix broken things isn't something I see a robot being able to accomplish, even with AI, anytime soon. Repairs being the main one. Everything breaks at some point, but not everything is going to break the same way. Now, I can see people behind a robot getting the robot to fix something but not just the robot doing it autonomously.\n\nLastly, I'm really disappointed by these comments. The number of you that believe blue collar workers aren't smart enough or have the capacity to surpass you via intellect is pretty astounding. And many of you would be really shocked at how wrong you are.",

Mais l’économie ne fonctionne pas en silos. La demande pour les métiers manuels dépend largement du pouvoir d’achat de gens dont une partie des revenus vient justement de jobs de bureau.\n\nSi une grosse part du travail intellectuel intermédiaire est comprimée par l’IA, la conséquence logique, ce n’est pas seulement du chômage, c’est une baisse globale de la consommation. Moins de projets, moins de rénovations, moins de dépenses non essentielles. Les métiers manuels ne disparaissent pas, mais leur volume de travail peut chuter.\n\nL’autre point est rarement évoqué : la reconversion. En cas de choc rapide, beaucoup de gens accepteront des métiers manuels à des conditions dégradées, au moins temporairement. Pas par choix, mais par nécessité. Ça crée mécaniquement une pression à la baisse sur les prix et les marges.\n\nDonc oui, même si l’IA ne remplace pas directement un plombier ou un électricien, elle peut les toucher indirectement par la demande, la concurrence et les revenus globaux.

The OP was correct and that. \n\nOffice workers will also start doing blue collar jobs when they need to earn a living. They probably won't be certified journeymen with 10 years experience or whatever, but they'll be YouTube experts who've done it around the house for a long time. And that means they'll be doing it for a lot cheaper than the certified journeyman. Apps like Task Rabbit will be full of former office workers looking to get hired for a job finishing a basement, remodeling a bathroom, etc. They'll lack the certifications bit they'll have a low enough price and high enough average review score that they'll get jobs. This will drastically bring down the average salary of the certified workers. \n\nAll of the above will eventually be screwed when humanoid robots are using 5G connections to AI networks to do blue collar jobs. I don't know why everyone thinks this is so incredibly difficult. It's really not that far off. If a human can be taught how to do something, a computer can also be taught how to do it. And we're rapidly getting to a point where the robot can perform the physical aspect, with a fast enough network connection to the computer that knows how to do it and is controlling the robot.",

      "text": "The public narrative around Google has changed significantly over the past 1 year. (I say public, because people who were closely following google probably saw this coming). Since Google's revenue primarily comes from ads, LLMs eating up that market share questioned their future revenue potential. Then there was this whole saga of selling the Chrome browser. But they made a great comeback with the Gemini 3 and also TPUs being used for training it.\n\nNow the narrative is that Google is the best position company in the AI era.\n\nAs a user do you really find Gemini 3 better than Claude?\n\n[How has the narrative around Google changed over the past 1 year?](https://decodingthefutureresearch.substack.com/p/how-has-the-narrative-around-google)",

          "text": "Grok is off the rails, as is obviously demonstrated. And the economics don't seem to make sense for ChatGPT. They are at a disadvantage relative to Gemini in both data and hardware costs. Claude has a lot of traction with enterprise users but they don't have the vertical integration that Gemini has with data and hardware.\n\nI think in the next few years we see the following:\n\n- OpenAI gets bought in a fire sale once investment runs out.\n- Grok continues as a niche product for certain people.\n- Gemini becomes the standard since they can charge less than their peers to be profitable. And access to more training data will ensure a certain minimum level of quality.\n- Claude remains the most favored for enterprise use. They'll end up having to chase higher quality (at a higher cost) to differentiate from Gemini.",

I also think consumers will ultimately go with the default option (if quality is in the same ballpark) and Google will be powering virtually every smartphone.\n\nAnd yeah I'm being \"politically correct\" around Grok lol.

Gemini 3 flash seems very capable for knowledge tasks. Google also has an infinite runway with a cash flow positive business that can sustain high intensity research for the long term. They will win in the end. They missed first to market because of timidity regarding disrupting their own business model. But now they’re cooking.\n\nClaude has a niche that will protect it for a few years unless Google refocuses its attention on coding. Google’s history of abandoning side projects suggests that they’ll not be able to execute the focus that would be required to capture the enterprise developer market. The only question in my mind is will Gemini become good enough that developers don’t need the best, but instead need an economical solution.",

The deep researcher is quite good The deep thinker is quite good.  Like anthropic they don't allow you to upload zip files but just like anthropic you can just change the extension on your zip file to.zp and let the LLM know that it is a zip repo, so you can use the deep researcher to create solid HLDs and SDDs for large projects.  ",

DeepSeek, Perplexity, Grok, Claude, Copilot – These ranked below the big three:\n\t•\tDeepSeek ~328 M visits/month  ￼\n\t•\tPerplexity ~240 M visits/month  ￼\n\t•\tGrok ~227 M visits/month  ￼\n\t•\tClaude ~186 M visits/month  ￼\n\t•\tMicrosoft Copilot ~110 M visits/month  ￼\n\nMarket Share Notes\n\t•\tCombined, ChatGPT and Gemini account for ~86% of all AI platform web traffic in early 2026.  ￼\n\t•\tThe rest (DeepSeek, Grok, Perplexity, Claude, Copilot) share ~14% of that traffic.  ￼\n\nBig Picture Context\n\t•\tEven as AI platforms grow fast, AI referral traffic still makes up a small percent of all global web traffic (~1% overall), with ChatGPT driving most of that share.  ￼\n\t•\tTraditional giants like Google Search, YouTube, and Facebook still dominate overall web rankings ahead of even ChatGPT.  ￼",

Fast forward to now: Gemini consistently topping leaderboards in long-context reasoning & multimodal, TPUs actually delivering better perf-per-dollar than H100 clusters in many internal workloads, and Google quietly integrating AI everywhere (Search, YouTube, Android, Workspace). \n\nIt’s not hype — it’s just that Google plays the long game with insane resources while startups get the flashy headlines for the first 18 months. The real question now is whether OpenAI can pull another leap with whatever they’re cooking post the recent “code red” panic, or if we’re entering the “Google inevitably wins via distribution + infra” era. \n\nWhat do you guys think happens in 2026–27? Does distribution (Gemini in every Android phone + potential Apple deal spillover) become unbeatable?",

Like who cares about the reputation anymore if you have the same amount of questions being asked like you where launched in 2009.\n\nIt just got toxic and toxic everyday. They literally deserved it. Not accepting AI answers? What are you caveman? Their point should be helping the questioner, not trying to fight with AI.\n\nAnd they removed their Jobs section too. Which got nearly 4000 downvotes. A lot of people disliked this decision but they did it.",

I just wanted to solve peoples' problems for fun, and because I have 35yrs exp, and enjoyed it, but I got fed up with the constant mod harassment and never went back.\n\nInterestingly on my last post, before leaving I told the mods there's no such thing as too much correct information because some day AI was going to be sifting thru it, and the more good info the better, and so I said to them fvck off and good day sir. lol. I was right. I'm glad StackOverflow died. They ABSOLUTELY deserved it.",

That incentive structure rewards nitpicking.\n- The **AI answer ban** (at least early on) wasn’t caveman energy so much as **signal-to-noise**: tons of plausible-sounding wrong answers flooded in, and reviewers can’t fact-check everything at scale.\n\nThat said, SO absolutely shot itself in the foot by:\n- letting “RTFM” culture become normal\n- making newcomers feel like they’re interrupting a priesthood\n- removing stuff like Jobs without replacing the value people actually came for\n\nWhere I’ve landed:\n- Use **Stack Overflow** for *specific, reproducible questions* (minimal example, exact error, what you tried).\n- Use **Reddit/Discord/GitHub issues** for *exploratory / “how should I think about this?”* questions where context and discussion matter.\n- Use AI to draft/debug, but **verify + cite docs** before treating it as “the answer.”\n\nAlso, that “alt account to bait an answer” tactic *works*, but it’s basically the same ego game you’re criticizing—better to just pick a venue that doesn’t punish curiosity.",

After making no headway and getting responses like “Honestly, if you don’t know what {specific technical jargon} is, you shouldn’t even have a jellyfin server”, he gave up and tried ChatGPT and got his server upgraded in around 5 minutes. \n\nThis led the community to share their experiences about having to use AI in place of traditional older options like subreddits and stack overflow because those communities are just not helpful enough to justify dealing with the verbal abuse when you can go to ChatGPT and get the same answer in less time. ",

      "text": "I would reckon AI will replace some jobs, not all. It all has to do with reliability, liability, confidentiality and human nature.\n\nReason 1: Reliability\n\nAI hallucinates too much, that needs to be fixed before we automate jobs with AI. Are companies really gonna fully rely on AI tech for crucial software implementation within the next 10 years. Forbes 500 companies won't take that risk. Small business might, but that's a drop in the ocean. Also thinking about schools, colleges and universities, where every mistake can be the difference between a lawsuit or not (ties in with liability). I.E. AI fucks up and a student doesn't graduate while he should've. It takes years to create work flows and practices around new AI processes. And it takes humans to create those.\n\nReason 2: Liability\n\nManagers like to have legal cover, with people you can blame an employee for mistakes. If an AI is to be blamed, the manager only has itself to blame. You can't argue in court that nobody is liable because an AI did it.\n\nReason 3: Confidentiality\n\nPlus companies need to have their own in-house AI technology bc they can't allow their data to become open source or be used as training data for open source. Because AI companies are not gonna become closed source. This all takes time. 10 years before mass hysteria sets in.\n\nReason 4: Human Nature\n\nPeople like to feel important, they like to play off the social ladder, and you need social dynamics. It takes other people in the workplace to achieve that. You need other people to feel proud, to bully, to become friends with.. If there is only management. And under them only the people managing the AI. And under them only AI. (very simplified but you get the gist). Nobody will be satisfied (even the people making bank), and management will actively start hiring again. . It all has to do with human nature, we need other people above or below us to feel important.\n\nDo you guys agree with this reasoning?",

But my point is that we are seeing significant job losses in specific sectors, and the impact is growing every month.\n\nNow, the question is: do we think these growing concentric circles will start to shrink at some point? Or will they continue to grow? Of course, they will continue to grow. There will always be debates about how fast or how much, but I think that's a distraction at the end of the day.

But it's not the only example. It's reasonable to expect that, eventually, if the trend continues, we'll see something more visible in national employment statistics. That we aren't seeing this now does not at all negate my point.\n\n2. \"Reducing the need for future hiring\", in my view, should be folded into \"job losses due to AI\" - it's just a different case of essentially the same phenomenon. When we look at business growth, we often consider how that growth drives up employment and puts downward pressure on unemployment. But this dynamic will increasingly break thanks to AI. It will fundamentally change the way we think about the connection between economic growth and employment.",

If someone starts an entierly AI driven company, that means any other company can do that inhouse, because they have access to the same models as the AI startup. So these \"AI companies\" are, most of them, entierly worthless.\n\nHowever, there is a way in which these companies can outcompete, and that is by providing a service or product for cheaper, at roughly the same quality, but at much faster speeds than a legacy company can reform itself to compete. Essentially, the legacy company cant reform itself internally with AI fast enough to safe itself from being outcompeted by the AI companies.\n\nThis is a possibility for larger companies, but for SaaS-companies (for example) or othee AI companies that provide a singular or a few small services, there is really no reason for them to exist. They can try and make a run for it and see how much money they can generate, but they're living on borrowed time because in a heartbeat they can be undecut or be made redundant by the same AI models they use for their business.",

Large organizations don’t avoid AI because it isn’t capable — they avoid putting AI in positions where responsibility becomes ambiguous.\n\nThat’s why, in practice, AI tends to replace tasks rather than roles. It can propose, analyze, and optimize, but execution in high-stakes contexts stays gated by humans, policies, and auditable decision processes.\n\nSo I’d frame it less as “AI won’t replace jobs” and more as: AI won’t replace responsibility.

Reliability and liability don’t block adoption; they push AI into tighter human-AI systems where AI does the heavy cognitive lifting and humans own final decisions. That already increases productivity enough to shrink teams without fully removing accountability. Confidentiality is moving the same way; private models, on-prem deployment, and fine-tuning mean AI adapts to companies faster than companies adapt to people. The “human nature” point is real, but history shows organizations prioritize efficiency first and rebuild social structures later around whatever tools dominate. AI doesn’t need to replace every thinking job to reshape most of them, and that reshaping alone changes power, value, and headcount.

As with *every* technology ever, there are always hiccups at the start and lack of supporting architecture. When lightbulbs were first invented, they broke frequently and many homes lacked electrical wiring to even make use of them. It took further development for them to become reliable and it took the development of supporting infrastructure (electrical wiring and transmission) to make use of them. A.I. will go through the same hurdles. Right now it's not the most reliable thing, but it's already demonstrating tangible benefits, so A.I. itself will be improved *and* supporting infrastructure will be improved. With how much money is currently being invested in A.I., I'm guessing these improvements will come quickly. \n\nAs for legal concerns, A.I. is already in a legal purgatory, and it will only be a matter of time before legal issues get sorted out. Also, if you think companies can just blame their employees when things go wrong to get out of legal situations, that's just incorrect. If a company is held legally responsible for something, it doesn't matter if that thing was done by an employee, even if it was unknown by the company, the company is still liable. A.I. will be no different. \n\nAs for confidentiality, this one is the easiest to address. It's not difficult to create separation between A.I. models, their training data, and confidential company data. Companies are already doing it. An A.I. model can be trained on publicly available data, then be put in an isolated environment with the company's confidential data where the A.I. couldn't share that with the outside world.\n\nAs for human nature I agree that human nature will be one of the driving factors preventing A.I. from taking over every job, but not for the reason you put forth. Companies will always prioritize profits over how \"comfortable\" their employees are. So no, \"feeling important\" will not be a factor in A.I. integration. \n\nThe biggest reason that I don't think A.I. will fully replace humans any time soon is an economic one. If A.I. starts to replace large swathes of the human workforce, you will be left with a large amount of unemployed people. Unemployed people can't stimulate the economy, so any country that makes widespread use of A.I to fill its workforce will have a dead or dying economy. Not to mention a population with that is unhappy with its government. Neither of those are things that a country will want, so any intelligent country will impose restrictions on A.I. so that it can't fully replace its workforce with A.I. That, or they will introduce a Universal Basic Income, but I find that less likely.",

On the whole, what it produces is better than the average person, however it doesn’t (currently) really come close to matching what the most creative and critical thinking people can come up with.\n\nI think it probably never will as intelligence is overrated in the grand scheme of things and much of the greatest things we’ve ever done weren’t done on purpose.

If an AI is more competent than a person than things go wrong less - therefore less liability.\n\n\nOn an individual level - imagine in 5 years time a series of studies come out confirming that using an AI doctor is more likely to lead to a correct diagnosis than a human doctor. Which one are you going to use?? Are you going to use the human doctor so you can sue them if the diagnosis is incorrect?\n\n\nAs for the human nature argument - even if this were true to some extent - the company that hires people just for the sake of having people around will just lose out to their competitor who doesnt\n\n\nNow, having said all that, I don't necessarily think AI will take all these jobs - but not for the reasons you listed",

          "text": "What this hot take misses is how incremental technological change actually unfolds over time — especially across ~10-year cycles.\n\n\n🔹 History shows skepticism at the start of every major tech wave.\nWhen computers first arrived in offices in the 1980s, many people also said they wouldn’t change how work gets done. But by the 1990s and early 2000s, computers didn’t just assist tasks — they reshaped entire industries, workflows, and job categories. Office automation didn’t replace all jobs overnight, but it fundamentally changed what work looked like and created whole new job categories that didn’t exist before. \n\n\n🔹 Each decade sees both displacement and creation.\nResearch into automation and labor markets shows that technological change is complex — it destroys some jobs, shifts task requirements, and creates new ones. Over time, workers who adapt complement machines rather than compete with them. Jobs requiring problem-solving, creativity, humans-in-the-loop decision-making, empathy, and complex judgment have historically persisted even as technology advances. \n\n\n🔹 The 10-year viewpoint is key:\nFrom the introduction of the personal computer to the internet era to mobile and cloud computing, widespread job transformation took years, not months. Studies find that even after major AI tools like ChatGPT hit the mainstream, there’s been no major disruption in aggregate employment trends yet. That’s exactly what we’d expect from historical patterns — major labor shifts almost always take a decade or more to materialize fully. \n\n\n🔹 AI is accelerating task automation — but not eliminating whole professions instantaneously.\nCurrent data suggests AI struggles with nuanced, context-dependent jobs, and has only fully automated a small percentage of real work tasks so far. Much of the change we are seeing is augmentation — where AI enhances human productivity rather than replacing it outright. \n\n\n✅ So the correct frame isn’t “AI won’t replace thinking jobs.”\nIt’s: Technology historically restructures labor gradually, often creating more new roles than it destroys over long cycles. Disruption within 1–3 years is almost unheard of. That’s not denial — that’s what long-term economic and labor data actually show.\n\n\nIf you want to talk about what might happen in the next 10–20 years, that’s a separate but important discussion — one that all economists and labor studies take seriously — but dismissing the pace of real structural change based on short-term impressions isn’t supported by history or data.",

This is both physically and literally impossible in 25 years, let alone 10, without hundreds of trillions of dollars in immediate investment starting right now, like today, needed. Not to mention that as AI ramps up, costs of power will also go up quickly, increasing the cost of that AI rapidly, making it less economical to replace humans. \n\nThis is going to be much harder to overcome than most tech bros think.

Professions like software engineering will be hit first and hardest. Some examples:\n\nNo, you don’t need 100 developers to define strategy and architecture. You need 10, at best. And yes, backlogs are endless, but in that case, companies will simply onboard additional AI agents to take on even more work. \n\nNo, if AI and AI agents become better and better, this won’t automatically create massive technical debt, at least not more than hiring large numbers of junior and mid-level developers. Besides, the most important factor here is whether management considers quality important at all. In reality, they care more about speed than quality. Sure, this might lead to some companies failing, but that won’t help you with your job loss in the short term.\n\nNo, the government will not take care of you when you lose your job. In the end, the most important thing in our society is that rich people get richer. If this becomes a huge global problem, there might be civil unrest but even then, AI is not going away. The transition is going to be very, very painful, and it may take years until we find some sort of balance.\n\nNo, “learning to use AI” will not save most jobs. If a single person with AI tools can now do the work of five or ten, companies will not keep the other four or nine out of goodwill. Upskilling helps individuals stay relevant longer, but it does not change the underlying math.\n\nNo, new “AI-related jobs” will not offset the losses at scale. A few highly specialized roles will be created, but far fewer than the number of jobs being automated away.\n\nNo, \"I've been hearning this for years\" is not a valid counterargument. The progress is real, steady and not slowing down in any kind of way.",

I spend a large amount of my time in meetings with stakeholders and customers figuring out what they actually need, often contrary to what they think they need. \n\nYou have the whims of ELT, pushing high level strategy that needs to be executed on at the product level, often loaded with “why” but thin on the “how”. \n\nDid I mention keeping the channel happy?, responding to escalated issues (licensing, billing, or other issues), often requiring engaging with multiple members of the team across engineering, support or finance, and debugging across distributed systems, CRMs, and only one cloud provider if you’re lucky. This often includes a 24 hour on-call component.\n\nI’m not denying that agentic workflows will change organisations, I’m personally predicting that we will see the renaissance of small teams that are product/solution first. The traditional engineer, project manager/BA, support, all rolled into a single role. \n\nBut let’s be real, if AI can eventually automate all of this then we will have much larger problems in society than SWEs losing their jobs, because a large percentage of your average office jobs are essentially “busy work”",

To outsiders, accounting is ripe for disruption by machine learning because the core function is record production and maintenance and generating reports. But despite attempted ML disruptors in the space for the better part of a decade, the industry has more employment than ever. Why? Because although the record keeping is central to the work, the _valuable_ part of the work is human: problem-solving, identifying and resolving errors, and making judgment calls on ambiguous questions.\n\nSo I'll believe all this hype around AI when it starts to produce some evidence of disruption. Machine learning has been targeting the accounting sector for a lot longer than it has targeted anything else, and it has little to show for the effort so far.",

Once that is done why do you need that person when an AI can control all the AIs controlling the systems and provide the high level direction based on customer needs and executive guidance.  \n\nAll the sudden you have a human leadership team making decisions (probably with AI support) and no humans doing any work.  \n\nAI isnt there yet but it will get better.",

Yesterday, I had Codex AI flag a line it wrote a couple of months back as logically wrong and suggesting another function call(I was asked for a tiny python script and I don't know python, I'm a php developer, and I was told just use AI), so anyway, who is right? Yesterday's AI agent or the AI agent back in September? IDK I can't ask it what it was thinking back then.\n\nThere is also the accountability problem, the lack of learning problem. Like yes I might mess up(and on occasion, I messed up badly) but myself and the organization learned out of the blunders, new policies were implemented, and I carried forward that experience to other companies. Does AI have experience like that? Can it immediately tell a manager \"hey let us not try that because the last company I was in did and x y z happened\"?",

Our society cannot deal with large amounts of unemployment in perpetuity. And because a lot of jobs (like the trades, plumber, electrician, etc., that are often mentioned.) rely on the middle class having other jobs and money to spend, there will be large, second-order effects because individuals and corporations lose their customer bases.\n\nAll that to say, if AI sucks, try to find a job (somehow get the required training and hope you’ll be good at it) that it cannot replace and that doesn’t rely on the middle class too much. \n\nIf AI actually does what the hype men promise (which I doubt, they’re very motivated to overpromise), be rich. Bc you won’t be making money anymore.",

You implement AI and suddenly you need only 10% of the workforce. Now your staff costs drop to $200,000. Profit?\n\nBut if you think bigger scale. If your revenue comes from developers and suddenly 'developer' is no longer a viable job - or wages collapse to the point where people barely survive - who exactly is still paying for your subscription? I just don’t see how, in a world of massive layoffs, companies would maintain their expected revenues. Revenue from whom? From other big companies? And where do those companies get their money from if their customer base is unemployed or stuck on minimum wages?\n\nIn an extreme scenario, money gets hoarded by a handful of entities - but for normal, working society, that money becomes meaningless. People are simple creatures: they need food, water, and shelter. If necessary, we can live perfectly fine without Netflix, TVs, GPUs, printer subscriptions or talking cars.\n\nSo what exactly are all those AI companies going to make money from if they stop redistributing wealth at least by employing people? They sure as hell won’t AI generate my dinner. At that point, they would be just a very expensive and mostly useless pile of silicon.\n\nAI is often compared to the industrial revolution, but I think there’s a flaw in that comparison. The industrial revolution transformed the production of goods required to meet basic human needs: food, clothing, construction materials, tools.\n\nAI, on the other hand, mostly impacts digital services, media, information processing - things that are not essential for survival. It automates services for the very people it threatens to replace. And if those people disappear economically, wouldn’t that eliminate the demand for those services in the first place?",

Even if the bar stays a bit higher and not everybody can do it, if the company can do it with 1/10 SWEs what will they do when all those laid off engineers start doing apps and become competition. They say that now you can make complex apps with small teams and the companies are cheering this. But it also means that the laid off engineers can form very small companies and start doing similar apps and now what ? Competition will break the larger companies doing all those layoffs. So, these profits the tech companies are seeing after layoffs are only transient, they are basically killing their future: their competition will increase drastically and the general consumption will decrease (if I have no money the priorities are housing and food on the table, I don't need apps).",

And self driving is a relatively \"simple\" problem, drive on a road, avoid running over solid objects. Respect stop signs and traffic lights.\n\nDriving is a game with specific rules, cars have radars, cameras, GPS, database coordinates of where traffic lights and intersections are so that they can pay more attention, a ridiculously expensive super computer they haul on board and yet? Waymo is still making mistakes in the few cities it has been practicing in for a decade.\n\nAnd you guys expect AI to replace humans in the wild, in jobs that have unpredictable problems, that require judgement and nuance, that require a decision to be made at a cross road and responsibility to be taken. I don't see it.\n\nThere was a lot of talk in \\~2018 I think about how truck drivers in the US will be replaced by self driving trucks. They usually have predictable routes from A to B.

Ai doesn't meet with stakeholders, partners or customers. It doesn't meet with the CFO or CTO to figure out exactly what it is they need, instead of what they want. It doesn't comb the company archives, docs, old repos, and commit messages to discover why Jorge wrote that library in Perl 10 years ago only to abandon it a year later. \n\nAnd most importantly, AI is not help responsible for actions and decisions that customers, banks, auditors and government agencies require.

If they destroy everybody... well that's not a ideal world for any human.

It makes much more sese that one way or another we will make it through to the next stage of the nation... what will that be? I think that's what we need to start discussing!

But most real-world systems aren’t just clean code problems. they’re full of legacy decisions, weird constraints, stakeholder politics, and edge cases that AI doesn’t really “own” responsibility for.\n\nAlso, a lot of companies already cut too close to the bone on staffing. Removing more people doesn’t always mean better efficiency, sometimes it just means slower decisions, more risk, and more fragile systems, since LLM companies haven't completely solved AI hallucination problems completely.\n\nI see AI more as a pressure multiplier than a total replacement. It exposes bad management, weak processes, and low-quality standards faster.

At it's heart is a tendency to be oblivious to what is basically maths: People don't seem to bother thinking enough to understand that just because some demand will remain, that doesn' t mean there won't be vast reductions in the amount of teachers needed. \n\nTheir thinking is \"Yeah but people want real people to teach their kids.\" Delightfully simple, and certainly true. However, a more in-depth consideration of the kinds of students who learn English as a second language reveals that while the very rich students among them will continue to seek expert human tuition, there are huge numbers of them from moderately wealthy or poorer families, who routinely cut back on luxuries and even basic needs in order to help their kids speak English. Some even ensure that all but one kid works 12 hours a day with the whole family contributing to ensure they can just about afford to send the youngest to an English class a few times a week.  \n\nIt's pretty obvious to me that for at least a sizeable % of those families, if you have the choice to pay: \n\na) $20-$40 ph for an private English tutor; \n\nb) perhaps $5 ph for a place in a class of 20 for one or more of their kids; or \n\nc) limitless language tuition with AI avatars that can teach all day and night and engage in conversation practice, mark essays, give bilingual feedback, analyse progress and provide tailored exercises to help them improve, for all their kids, for, who knows; $5 a month or whatever it's gonna cost when such an app is reliably available (probably already, and my friend is building one with my help in anticipation of the stark reality you correctly predict)?\n\n...then once it becomes abundantly clear that most or all the initial shortcomings of the tech are ironed out, I expect almost everyone is gonna opt for c)\n\nI've seen this debate online in English teaching circles, with people failing to recognise that a (guesstimate) 50% to 80% reduction in demand for their services can happen even if some people still are willing to pay for human tuition (I don't doubt that general high schooling will continue to be human-teacher dominated field for the time being; this is about extracurricular language classes); with others initially correctly; but ultimately shortsightedly as I will elaborate on shortly; pointing out that only the top 20% of people in terms of qualifications and experience can expect to keep their jobs.\n\n...and this is where I weigh in and tell all of them ***\"Guys, there isn't even going to be a demand for language learning whatsoever*** except among the handful of people who want to do it for a hobby, ***because we're all gonna have 100% accurate, instantaneous in-ear translation devices that work for every language in the world.\"***\n\nWe'll be able to chat-up women on the beaches of Rio, fly to Japan and watch a Japanese theatre play live, then to a seminar in Uzbekistan and finally a conference call with our company going over our global marketing strategy with executives from 15 countries and we'll understand every single word without having to bother learning a thing.\n\nWe need a new economic model, urgently.",

While in isolation, your point about inept management is true, your wider assumption that everything is going to be ok couldn't be more wrong.\n\nWhen engines appeared and horse and carriage drivers were out of work, they could retrain as car or vehicle drivers and have a job for life. We can't do that now.\n\nWhat you're missing here is a mathematically robust inconvenient truth: When the rate of technological advancement outpaces the rate at which humans can retrain, we're out of work and by the time we upskill, those opportunities are gone too.  \n\nAdd to that when the rate of advancement outpaces the maximum realistic speed at which any cultural shift in the adoption of new trends and products can happen, then no new jobs appear because those markets won't have appeared yet. And even if those jobs appear, a robot will be able to do them.\n\nNo matter what it is you think you will be able to do to bring value to a company, the simple fact is that whenever a suitable AI is available for digital work (already; in many cases), and soon after this, whenever a suitable robot is available for physical work, then, once purchased and those overheads are already covered, electricity is always going to be cheaper than human labour.\n\nIf the rate at which the ability to automate tasks improved was linear and more or less matched the rate at which humans could learn a new skill, you'd be right in being unconcerned, but that's the the world we live in. It's improving at what, hundreds or thousands of times faster than we can learn anything?\n\nIt's abundantly clear that a new economic paradigm must appear. The current system cannot support us all as this new system takes shape.",

It is still in its toddler stage and is taking its first tentative steps. It still needs us (people) to hold its hand.\n\nThat is what most people are seeing currently. AI has its place and its uses, but overall it still needs human input and oversight, it's not replacing people en masse, but it is making tasks easier and quicker. If you used to employ ten people in a department, and you can give them AI tools to be more efficient so you only need 8, that this is just the beginning.\n\nEach AI agent has a specific task to perform, over time these WILL be tweaked and improved upon, errors will slowly be eradicated as the technology improves. Who knows how long that will take, and it's probably going to bottlenecked by the need for more data centers and resources.\n\nHowever, I think there will come a point where individual AI agents will either be merged, or linked together slowly into a larger system. It will still need oversight to some degree, but less and less as time goes on. Systems will just become faster and more efficient, much more so that any human being.\n\nRemember, this is artificial intelligence, it is replacing the need for cognitive thought and effort. This is not one technology like an engine replacing horses, AI can basically be applied to everything. Anything that a human being can do, is being mapped out and copied.\n\nI think it will just bleed into everything.\n\nIn twenty years we might have fully automated cars. You might not need to own one, but just subscribe to a system where a car arrives and takes you to your destination. Transport will be just like Spotify. You don't own the vehicle, you just have access whenever you want it. This will eradicate jobs in transport, truck drivers, taxi drivers, driving instructors etc. All automated, all gone. It will be much more safer, quicker and efficient and it won't happen overnight, it will be implemented at pace.\n\nI have watched AI agents in call centers improve in transcribing text when people speak. I can easily imagine with twenty years of improvement, that these systems will get to a point where pretty much anything you say will have an answer pre programmed and a system mapped out depending on the use. The \"person\" you are speaking to will sound fully authentic and have a language model built in to assist you. Built upon years of programming.\n\nMaybe my timeline of twenty years is being a bit pessismistic, maybe it will take longer. But Pandora's box has certainly been opened and we are living in a time to see the start of all of this.\n\nCapitalism and profit will drive this all through to fruition, like every other emerging technology. This is not going away ever, it will just improve, get better, quicker and smarter.",

Taken over by the platform provider, ApplePay, GooglePay, etc. They picked and chose the highest ROI apps to make and let the 3rd parties fight over the 2nd, 3rd and 4th place value adds - filling in all the small niches. \n\nNow the platforms themselves are very close to being able to efficiently provide most of those niches themselves - they won’t need the 3rd party developers as much, and they won’t want to stop at their 30% rev share, they’ll move to in-house more and more and more apps for 100%\n\nMeta is boned in this because they don’t provide an OS (at least not in major markets), same with OpenAI, and all the companies that are downstream of the OS. Being upstream lets the platform / OS cut in front of the consumer and take over virtually any part of the consumer’s spend.\n\nIn b4 there will still be some 3rd party apps and some people are brand loyal etc - yes ofc, I’m talking about the majority and it’s not wise to make your plans around the rare exceptions.",

There still is value in the text --> agent --> output I value \n\nThat said, OpenAI is boiling the ocean building the models and investing heavily in tooling and apps. They are almost certainly going to make something like that sooner or later and my point will be moot.\n\nFor now, agent builder is good for folks who want to get simple chat experiences up and running quick with no dev.

              "text": "Its mostly nimbys running on disinfo. Data centers do not use up much power\n\n>The Economist has adapted a model of state-level retail electricity prices from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to include data centres (see chart 2). We find no association between the increase in bills from 2019 to 2024 and data-centre additions. The state with the most new data centres, Virginia, saw bills rise by less than the model projected. The same went for Georgia. In fact, the model found that higher growth in electricity demand came alongside lower bills, reflecting the fact that a larger load lets a grid spread its fixed costs across more bill-payers. Still, problems may be coming. The clearest warning sign comes from pjm Interconnection, the largest grid operator in the country. Prices at auctions for future generation capacity there have soared, as data-centre growth has yanked up projected demand. That will hit households; pjm reckons the latest auction will lift bills by up to 5%.\n\n>In principle, data centres could lower power prices. As well as adding more load to spread costs over, if data-centre operators are able to learn to curtail demand when the grid is under most strain (either with algorithmic tweaks, or paying for on-site backup batteries or generators), they could help use the existing grid more efficiently. On October 23rd Chris Wright, the energy secretary, proposed a rule that would speed-up grid connections for curtailable data centres. The optimistic scenario, then, is that new demand from data centres pays for upgrades to America’s power infrastructure.\n\nhttps://archive.is/RXoJG\n\nThere’s a reason electricity prices are rising. And it’s not data centers. It’s not AI. It’s not even data centers. https://archive.is/6q4gv\n\nAccording to a recent published study from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, data centers seem to have reduced household electricity costs where they're built. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040619025000612\n\n>Contrary to these concerns, our analysis finds that state-level load growth in recent years (through 2024) has tended to reduce average retail electricity prices. Fig. 5 depicts this relationship for 2019–2024: states with the highest load growth experienced reductions in real prices, whereas states with contracting loads generally saw prices rise. Regression results confirm this relationship: the load-growth coefficient is among the most stable and statistically significant across model variants. In the 2019–2024 timeframe, the regression suggests that a 10 % increase in load was associated with a 0.6 (±0.1) cent/kWh reduction in prices, on average (note here and in all future references the ± refers to the cluster-robust standard error). \n\n>This finding aligns with the understanding that a primary driver of increased electricity-sector costs in recent years has been distribution and transmission expenditures—often devoted to refurbishment or replacement of existing infrastructure rather than to serve new loads (ETE, 2025, Pierpont, 2024, EIA, 2024a, Forrester et al., 2024). Spreading these fixed costs over more demand naturally exerts downward pressure on retail prices.\n\nThis study was peer reviewed and published in the Electricity Journal Volume 38, Issue 4, December 2025, 107516\n\nAI is not causing energy prices to increase https://andymasley.substack.com/p/data-centers-and-electricity-part\n\n>The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory concluded that data center activity has not contributed to changes in national average household electricity costs.\nElectricity prices rose (4.8% nominally per year from 2019–2023) primarily due to inflation and surging utility costs. The single biggest factor was the spike in natural gas prices caused by the Russia-Ukraine war, which drove up fuel and purchased power expenses.\nData center electricity demand has grown steadily and predictably, making it an unlikely cause for sudden price shocks. While US electricity demand is rising (with data centers accounting for ~40% of growth), it is growing slower than it did in the 20th century—a period when inflation-adjusted prices often fell despite high demand.\n>While Virginia residents saw bills rise by 28.1% alongside a massive data center buildout, most of that increase was inflation. Virginia’s electricity prices actually increased less than the national average.\nThere is no strong correlation between data center density and skyrocketing rates. States with few data centers (like Maine) saw the fastest rate hikes, while 11 of the 15 states with the most data center expansion saw lower-than-average rate increases.\nHigh total electricity usage does not permanently raise prices (e.g., urban vs. rural rates are similar). Price spikes occur when demand outpaces supply in the short term, but prices balance once supply catches up.\nWhile data centers are not the national driver of inflation, they have been cited by authorities in specific locations (Virginia, Arizona, Delaware, Oregon) as one of several factors contributing to localized cost increases, though the exact impact remains unclear.",

              "text": "They never were \n\n>The Economist has adapted a model of state-level retail electricity prices from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to include data centres (see chart 2). We find no association between the increase in bills from 2019 to 2024 and data-centre additions. The state with the most new data centres, Virginia, saw bills rise by less than the model projected. The same went for Georgia. In fact, the model found that higher growth in electricity demand came alongside lower bills, reflecting the fact that a larger load lets a grid spread its fixed costs across more bill-payers. Still, problems may be coming. The clearest warning sign comes from pjm Interconnection, the largest grid operator in the country. Prices at auctions for future generation capacity there have soared, as data-centre growth has yanked up projected demand. That will hit households; pjm reckons the latest auction will lift bills by up to 5%.\n\n>In principle, data centres could lower power prices. As well as adding more load to spread costs over, if data-centre operators are able to learn to curtail demand when the grid is under most strain (either with algorithmic tweaks, or paying for on-site backup batteries or generators), they could help use the existing grid more efficiently. On October 23rd Chris Wright, the energy secretary, proposed a rule that would speed-up grid connections for curtailable data centres. The optimistic scenario, then, is that new demand from data centres pays for upgrades to America’s power infrastructure.\n\nhttps://archive.is/RXoJG\n\nThere’s a reason electricity prices are rising. And it’s not data centers. It’s not AI. It’s not even data centers. https://archive.is/6q4gv\n\nAccording to a recent published study from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, data centers seem to have reduced household electricity costs where they're built. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040619025000612\n\n>Contrary to these concerns, our analysis finds that state-level load growth in recent years (through 2024) has tended to reduce average retail electricity prices. Fig. 5 depicts this relationship for 2019–2024: states with the highest load growth experienced reductions in real prices, whereas states with contracting loads generally saw prices rise. Regression results confirm this relationship: the load-growth coefficient is among the most stable and statistically significant across model variants. In the 2019–2024 timeframe, the regression suggests that a 10 % increase in load was associated with a 0.6 (±0.1) cent/kWh reduction in prices, on average (note here and in all future references the ± refers to the cluster-robust standard error). \n\n>This finding aligns with the understanding that a primary driver of increased electricity-sector costs in recent years has been distribution and transmission expenditures—often devoted to refurbishment or replacement of existing infrastructure rather than to serve new loads (ETE, 2025, Pierpont, 2024, EIA, 2024a, Forrester et al., 2024). Spreading these fixed costs over more demand naturally exerts downward pressure on retail prices.\n\nThis study was peer reviewed and published in the Electricity Journal Volume 38, Issue 4, December 2025, 107516\n\nAI is not causing energy prices to increase https://andymasley.substack.com/p/data-centers-and-electricity-part\n\n>The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory concluded that data center activity has not contributed to changes in national average household electricity costs.\nElectricity prices rose (4.8% nominally per year from 2019–2023) primarily due to inflation and surging utility costs. The single biggest factor was the spike in natural gas prices caused by the Russia-Ukraine war, which drove up fuel and purchased power expenses.\nData center electricity demand has grown steadily and predictably, making it an unlikely cause for sudden price shocks. While US electricity demand is rising (with data centers accounting for ~40% of growth), it is growing slower than it did in the 20th century—a period when inflation-adjusted prices often fell despite high demand.\n>While Virginia residents saw bills rise by 28.1% alongside a massive data center buildout, most of that increase was inflation. Virginia’s electricity prices actually increased less than the national average.\nThere is no strong correlation between data center density and skyrocketing rates. States with few data centers (like Maine) saw the fastest rate hikes, while 11 of the 15 states with the most data center expansion saw lower-than-average rate increases.\nHigh total electricity usage does not permanently raise prices (e.g., urban vs. rural rates are similar). Price spikes occur when demand outpaces supply in the short term, but prices balance once supply catches up.\nWhile data centers are not the national driver of inflation, they have been cited by authorities in specific locations (Virginia, Arizona, Delaware, Oregon) as one of several factors contributing to localized cost increases, though the exact impact remains unclear.",

It is not only an insult to society, it is illegal>, said Liz Kendall, the Secretary of State for Technology, in Parliament.\n\n=> [EuroNews](https://fr.euronews.com/next/2026/01/13/des-interdictions-aux-enquetes-quels-pays-visent-le-chatbot-ia-grok-delon-musk)\n\n*** Which countries have banned Grok? ***\n\n- Indonesia was the first country to temporarily block Grok in order to protect women and children.\n\n- Malaysia\nThe Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) ordered a temporary ban on Grok on Sunday after what it called \"repeated misuse\" of the tool to generate obscene, sexually explicit, and manipulated images without consent.\n\n=> [EuroNews](https://fr.euronews.com/next/2026/01/13/des-interdictions-aux-enquetes-quels-pays-visent-le-chatbot-ia-grok-delon-musk)\n\nFeel free to add any countries I've missed.\n\n\nNote: The premium on-demand undressing service is no longer available. Or almost. Elon Musk's social network announced Wednesday evening, January 14, measures to prevent the editing of images of real people in revealing outfits, such as bikinis, by the account of its artificial intelligence tool, Grok. This is a \"geographic\" block, not a global one; the restriction is limited to \"jurisdictions where it is illegal,\" X emphasized in a message posted late that day in the United States.\n\n=>[Libération](https://www.liberation.fr/economie/economie-numerique/x-restreint-partiellement-le-deshabillage-des-personnes-reelles-avec-grok-sous-la-pression-de-plusieurs-pays-20260115_ZCVPBKOECRE7HBDCLRZ4GRHUF4/)\nIf I've forgotten a country, please feel free to add it.",

But truth be told, their Codex product is one of the best in market (I used the Codex extension for vscode, they provide really generous rate limits even for the $20 plus sub)\n\nI'm using other products right now (Gemini for writing/media generation, Claude for claude code, Perplexity for general web search/to access different models in one place, GitHub copilot, Notion, etc. for which I have the free yearly sub from my edu mail) and the experience has been much better.

      "text": "Alphabet recently moved ahead of Apple in overall valuation, but focusing on rankings misses the more important shift underneath.\n\nGoogle built much of the early neural network infrastructure, and the current wave of large models is playing directly to those strengths. What caught attention internally wasn’t a flagship product launch, but a research image model experiment that showed meaningfully lower inference latency than comparable systems, which in turn triggered broader organizational changes.\n\nDeepMind and Google Research were consolidated into what is now the Gemini engineering organization. Instead of fragmented research and product groups, model development, systems, and deployment started operating as a single pipeline.\n\nThe hardware layer is a large part of this story. Google’s latest TPU generation, Ironwood, moves to a 3nm process and higher-bandwidth memory, allowing much higher throughput per pod and noticeably better energy efficiency for large-scale training workloads compared to general-purpose accelerators.\n\nOn top of that stack, Gemini’s largest models are trained and served within the same vertically controlled environment, keeping training scale, inference latency, and cost tightly coupled. That kind of optimization is difficult to replicate without owning the entire pipeline.\n\nThis is where the structural advantage shows. Google controls custom silicon, global cloud infrastructure, and uniquely large real-world data streams from Search, YouTube, Maps, and Android, with distribution built into products people already use daily. That combination is hard for partnerships to fully reproduce.\n\nAs Gemini features roll into Google One, AI stops being a standalone tool and starts looking more like a default layer bundled into everyday digital life, shared across households rather than adopted one user at a time.The shift here isn’t speculative hype. It’s an infrastructure advantage gradually translating into long-term platform leverage.",

But I think their AI is hampered by not being able to commit copyright violations on a massive scale like their competitors. Gemini loves to tell me \"no\" when anything even gets close to someone else's IP. Being paranoid about this sort of thing is one of the curses of being a large company.\n\nGoogle has been the company benefiting from pirating before...YouTube was successful (and purchased by Google) initially because it was the first place that had all sorts of instantly-delivered pirated content that was reliably accessible. It wasn't until Viacom's lawsuit that Content ID appeared...before then it was the wild west.\n\nAnyhow, all the AI stuff being shoved down our throats by Googlr, et al still hasn't provided a killer app to people that aren't computer programmers. Like a lot of programmer-derived anything aimed at the mass market, they see it as something obvious that everyone needs but don't realize it's not true because they don't have any friends that aren't programmers.\n\nIt's cryptocurrency all over again but with political and reality destabilizing effects that even the most diamond-handed crypto zealots could not have dreamed of. They've managed to reinvent art but for doing crime.\n\nP.S.

Its no secret that OpenAI has pumped in billions of dollars into diversifying its portfolio and investing into what I recently read would not provide returns until the early 30's. Is the need to resort to ads then a consequence of Altman's hubris or a sign that the rat race has outpaced itself? Are we likely to see similar things across the board with Anthropic and Gemini (although it's hard to imagine Google running out of money)? Do you think the government would bail OpenAI out? And ultimately, is OpenAI having to turn to its \"last resort\" an optimistic turn, lessening competition pressure with a slower pace of development  and allowing Safety and AI Ethics to catch up?  \n",

These models are insanely expensive to run and train, and subscription revenue alone clearly isn't cutting it. Google's obviously fine since they print money with search ads, but yeah Anthropic might be sweating a bit\n\n  \nThe government bailing out OpenAI would be wild but honestly not impossible given how much political capital is tied up in \"AI leadership\"",

          "text": "1. They are offering ads on the free version. That seems fair to me.\n2. OpenAI is the closest competitor to Google ever created in terms of their tech capabilities. They have already started eating into Google’s market share. Why would you google something when ChatGPT can tell you the answer step-by-step. This is the perfect step to bust up the ad duopoly which has been scamming businesses since 1999. There are only two businesses that have made trillions of dollars with a 3% success rate (only 3% of ads convert IF you are GOOD.) I would rather see ads from ChatGPT than from Google and Facebook every day.\n3. That company would have the biggest IPO ever. Why do you think they need bailing out?\n\nThe AI bubble will burst for the companies who created ChatGPT wrapper apps and call it an AI platform. I saw something recently where they did a deep dive into startups for a fund and 70% of them who claimed to have AI were just using ChatGPT APIs. I have no idea on why funds never complete due diligence before giving ‘fake it til you make it’ guys millions of dollars after companies like Theranos spectacularly failed, but here we are.\n\nFor OpenAI specifically, Veo3 and RunwayML are winning over Sora for video. Midjourney and Nanobanana (what a stupid product name) are winning over Dali. Claude is a better writer and coder than ChatGPT (although both of them have competitive deep research platforms.)\n\nThat said- OpenAI is the most solid all-around platform so if you can only afford one subscription, they are the clear winner.\n\nThere is no AI winter coming for the major AI platforms unless companies like Nvidia stop selling to US based businesses. The only thing remaining is to continue improving the quality until you can’t tell if it’s real or AI (and that’s probably 2-3 years out), improve performance to optimize the hardware/electricity consumption, identify the price point for a sustainable business.\n\nBetween OpenAI and Anthropic- these two companies have created more innovation in the past 3 years than the past 20. Siri is a bust. Gemini is terrible and Google has a bloated mess on their hands.\n\nNow… let’s project into the future. The solutions are being built now to automate many info worker jobs in many industries. Those solutions haven’t gotten traction yet and aren’t hardened and the implementations aren’t foolproof. We have had support chatbots for over 10 years and IT teams do a terrible job of implementing them. Once the bots can train themselves and ask their human robot manager questions, the 50-80% of info worker jobs are gone. Customer service, accounts payable, sales, marketing. Instead of having 10 people on these teams m you will have 2 guiding and directing the AIs. This has already started happening in tech. Self driving vehicles are pretty close to maturity so boom….transportation industry is gone.\n\nNext up…the robot companies solve the problems of cost per unit, battery life and dexterity- add in an AI brain and boom 💥…the trades are gone.\n\n\nIf you think the AI winter is coming- you are not paying attention. Big brands like McDonalds would totally replace their teenage workforce with a robot and their franchise owners have the capital to invest once the technology is mature….probably 5-10 years out. A robot will always be a better employee than a human and will do exactly as programmed\n\nThe real AI winter is what do HUMANS do when they have no marketable skills, no savings, and new industries haven’t been created yet to create new jobs for the unemployed masses?",

          "text": "Recently, senior executives at Salesforce have admitted, both internally and publicly, that they massively overestimated Al's capabilities. They have found that Al simply can't cope with the complex nature of customer service and totally fails at nuanced issues, escalations, and long-tail customer problems. They even say that it has caused a marked decline in service quality and far more complaints.\n\nBut the problems go far deeper than that.\n\nBoth employees and executives have said that the company is wasting countless resources on firefighting to stabilise operations since the mass AI layoff. Employees have to spend so much time stepping in to correct the wildly wrong AI-generated responses that Al is wasting more time than it saves.\n\nIn other words, this AI reduces productivity, not increases it.",

Completely different results.\nSo now I’m curious what people here think:\nIs “prompting” actually a skill, or just common sense dressed up?\nDo better prompts really matter, or is this just placebo?\nAt what point does it make more sense to iterate with the AI vs. trying to perfect the first input?\nGenuinely interested in how others approach this.",

There are a huge number of reasons why it can differ so drastically from one to the next. Prompting is a reason, but not the only reason. Model choice is as well.

Linguists and programmer have tried to crack that for about 70 years and their biggest accomplishment was setting the alarm clock with Siri. With LLMs people don't even realize that this used to be an incredible difficult and unsolved problem. People just see that LLMs get answers wrong, but ignore that it what an insane accomplishment it is  understanding their questions in the first place (even in audio, foreign languages, scribbled on a paper, ...). \n\n2. Only trying one model, when the differences between models can still be gigantic, e.g. Grok has amazing Web search, generally far better than any human, meanwhile Google AI overview have been producing complete nonsense for months and months and done little more than getting in the way. Both of those are \"LLM Web Search\", it's just that one is amazing and the other is garbage. Same also goes the other direction, Google Gemini is the only one that can handle large document very well, while most other models either don't allow big uploads in the first place, or worse, accept them and than just silently fail to perform the tasks correctly.\n\n3. LLM still having weird holes in their performance, e.g. ask an LLM about it's own capabilities and you'll get complete nonsense answers. They are ridiculously bad at it. And for whatever reason, none of the AI companies have cared to fix that, even so it should be simple (e.g. just point to a FAQ).\n\n4. Free vs premium model or agent vs chat. Having an AI agent crunch through a problem for hours will obviously get different results than spending 30sec chatting with ChatGPT on a free account. But most people don't know what they are missing out on, and LLM are terrible at communicating that.",

Nonetheless, he works on single prompts and takes the AI at face value a lot. My workflow is a lot more layered, I am using AI to review AI work, I am reading it but further getting other models to explain the work actually carried out to find the flaws, eventually I feel like I actually have a decent understanding of it all and am able to provide genuine guidance.\n\nAt the end of the day prompting is everything, if you give it the direction it will find the answer. This is why having prior knowledge can help a lot, as it helps you provide the correct context, but nonetheless if you don’t know what your working on, it just requires a ton more effort as you have to learn it on the fly, but AI is pretty good at breaking topics down and giving you a strong enough basis to provide the correct context needed for the right answer.\n\nYour workflow is everything, how you use the AI matters a lot, understanding the factors that matter the most is also deeply important - context is king, but you can just as easily steer it in the wrong direction.

I thought it was a model issue, so I kept adding negative prompts like \"bad anatomy\" or piling on buzzwords like \"unreal engine 5, 8k, ultra detailed.\"\n\nI stumbled upon this breakdown today that actually explains the logic behind the plastic look, and it completely changed my workflow.\n\nThe gist is: Models are trained on photography captions. When you use generic buzzwords, the AI defaults to a flat, wide-angle \"smartphone\" look (infinite depth of field = fake looking).\n\nI started testing what the article suggested--swapping \"hyper-realistic\" for actual camera physics (e.g., \"shot on 85mm, f/1.8 aperture\"). The difference in skin texture and lighting is night and day. It stops trying to \"render\" the image and starts \"photographing\" it.\n\nThere’s a decent lens cheat sheet in here if you want to test the physics yourself.
