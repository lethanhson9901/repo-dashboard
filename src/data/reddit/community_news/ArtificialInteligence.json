      "text": "It was Saturday morning, January 3, 2026. A message from former President Donald Trump about a large-scale attack on Venezuela set the internet ablaze. Within minutes, images flooded social media platforms such as X, Instagram, and TikTok. We saw President Nicolás Maduro being led away in handcuffs by American agents. We saw cheering crowds in Caracas. We saw American troops landing. The problem? Much of this footage did not exist.\n\nIt had been generated by AI. While the world tried to understand whether a coup was actually taking place, millions of people were watching a fabricated reality. This incident marks a definitive tipping point. The line between fact and fiction has blurred.\n\n[Complete article](https://ioplus.nl/en/posts/the-venezuela-crisis-proves-our-reality-has-been-hacked-by-ai)",

Let's say it was THAT reliable. First off, that person would be made a billionaire. Whoever can do that will make bank and live in comfort. But let's say that product were offered to YouTube and Tik Tok and all big social media platforms. And let's say it were offered to them for a reasonable price. I still am unsure if those platforms would even buy it. I think that's because they make millions of dollars from unregulated AI crap. AI slop, including deepfakes, get millions of views. So this is a real problem. Even if the tech exists, these irresponsible platforms that only care about money might choose to reject the diagnostic tool.",

Reputable newsrooms like Reuters and the Associated Press are collaborating to trace the original sources and verify the authenticity of photos and videos. Other outlets, like the Washington Post, use these new processes for graphs or summaries, while the Guardian limits the use of synthetic images to avoid doubts about the real facts.

While people in the US or Europe sit around debating pixel artifacts, the actual ground reality in Caracas gets rewritten by whoever has the most compute power.\n\n\nIts basically a DDOS attack on a country's ability to even exist in real-time. If you can simulate a government's collapse and trigger a mass panic before the actual officials can even get a denial to upload... the simulation is the only reality that matters for those two hours. This is the end of info sovereignty for anyone who doesnt own the servers. And honestly stop talking about digital watermarks, they're a joke. A cryptographic tag doesnt do anything when a riot starts or the local currency hits zero. We're totally missing the point by focusing on the \"tech\" of the image instead of the \"speed\" of the lie. If you dont own the hardware you don't own your own national reality anymore",

Frankly I did not for a long time, after seeing too much of either straight up manipulations or very biased publications even earlier.\n\nThere are statements of all sides (which we may reasonably mistrust, but at least we know source).\n\nThere are, when we are speaking about big events influencing regonal statistics or so - research based on some data from more or less trusted sources (source may be lying, so better to see if it corellates well with other approximates or at least does not contradict their own earlier/other statements). And this research is based on some assumptions, so you need to realise it only makes sense if neither of these assumptions are broken too much.\n\nEverything else may as well not exist. Because even before AI there were many ways to create a picture exactly opposite of reality. Often without telling a word of lie.\n\nSo either it is some statement of verified source - and source itself may be lying. Or statistical research (and than we can crossreference).\n\nOtherwise it falls in same category as everything from memes to journalist publications. Maybe true, maybe not, ultimatelly does not tell anything at all. May give you an idea, but not be decisive source of information itself.\n\nNow, doubting stuff that way is surely time-consuming.\n\nWhich is why on top of that I prioritise stuff and don't give a fuck about the part which is not my concern (and the whole US politics and Venezuela particularly are... Well, way down the list of nowadays priority for me. Have bigger shit going on in places I am way more related with.

Is that not the case? \n\n(I also don't spend too much time in MS apps as I'm usually in things like AutoCAD or Rockwell programming software at work, and obviously Files, outlook, Teams.

It seems better but I expected better integration between Copilot and my Word and Excel documents.  It’s possible that I don’t know what I am doing.  I’ll open a document and ask it a question and it will tell me that I need to upload the document.  If I clarify that I have the document open, it will sometimes worth with it.  I have also had difficulties getting it to find and open documents on OneDrive.\n\nThe company I work for is a Microsoft shop so M365 is the only real option, though I do get to use Claude Code as well.\n\nI’ve been trying ChatGPT and Gemini.

The hard work is upstream: figuring out what’s actually needed, resolving ambiguity, handling edge cases, and designing systems that survive real usage. By the time you’re coding, most of the thinking should already be done.\n\nTools like GPT, Claude, Cosine, etc. are great at removing accidental complexity, boilerplate, glue code, ceremony. That’s real progress. But it doesn’t touch essential complexity.\n\nIf your system has hundreds of rules, constraints, and tradeoffs, someone still has to specify them. You can’t compress semantics without losing meaning. Any missing detail just comes back later as bugs or “unexpected behavior.”\n\nStrip away the tooling differences and coding, no-code, and vibe coding all collapse into the same job, clearly communicating required behavior to an execution engine.",

Only when I was implementing did I realize how many edge cases and random side problems I had to address. When AI implements for me, my analytical brain kind of shuts off and never reaches the same level of understanding.\n\nI think software quality will decline once AI is widely deployed. AI tends to lead you down weird paths that are technically a legitimate way of solving a problem but aren't the right way. The people overseeing this will become less aware of what's going on.

I literally watched Opus 4.5 do the following:\n\nWorking on a video game written in an OOP scripting language similar to C, I tell it to make X do one thing while Y does something else. Y is a subtype of X. What does it do? It writes a fucking in-line type-check in an X-level proc to check if the caller is subtype Y.\n\nIt couldn't even figure out basic DRY principle shit like \"use an override.\" And this is the most SOTA model for coding there is right now.\n\nIf you don't know enough to catch the AI using a type-check instead of polymorphism, you are building brittle spaghetti on a mountain of technical debt that will fall apart under the mildest stress. If you don't know *why* a type-check is worse than a polymorphic override, you cannot effectively \"architect\" jack shit. You will accept the \"working\" code, and your \"architecture\" will rot from the inside out.

At one company, engineers spent months chasing a concurrency bug where thousands of European requests conflicted with US-east-1 Aurora replicas. Mutexes were correct per instance, but failed globally: many app instances, async cross-region replication, and multiple writers racing to update the same record without a global coordinator.\n\nThe logs showed the real issue wasn’t code but assumptions. Cross-Atlantic latency and replication lag exceeded the system’s implicit consistency window—it assumed near-instant global agreement, which doesn’t hold in distributed systems.\n\nThe fix was simple: introduce a single global arbitration point by moving the source of truth into a globally accessible Redis layer. A handful of lines.\n\nI don’t think an AI would have found that. It required correlating logs, understanding physical latency limits, and recognizing a flawed distributed-systems assumption—an insight shaped by an old story about [email failures](https://www.ibiblio.org/harris/500milemail.html) caused by timeouts and distance.

Games are already over-saturated because the tools got really good (game engines). Hence 10,,000+ games per year being released on steam (people like making code+art, hence games, so there's already too many people making them). Being able to generate code & art more easily just makes that problem worse.\n\nCode & art generators are an important step on the AI journey, they've proved that the learning & generative algorithms are extremely general and powerful,  but I'd argue actually applying our computing power to generate more of what we are already have in abundance is wasteful.\n\nAI is currently being ran at a loss to draw users in. When you actually look at the hardware required to run it, and try running it locally, you have to think harder about what to actually apply it to .\n\nyou could argue that just about anything is reducable to software plus some kind of spatial design . i.e. solving something really dramatic like Nuclear Fusion , there will be a digital artefact which is blueprints for a reactor to build, and control software .. but the really big problems like this aren't limited by the information part, they're limited by the real world testing. the \"edit-compile-run\" cycles that really matter have a much bigger real world component.

Switch to Claude API (not web UI) - you get exact token counts and more control\n2. Use a client with retry logic (so network drops don't lose everything)\n3. Save conversation locally (so you can resume if context limit hit)\n\n**Tools that help:**\n\n- `llm` CLI by Simon Willison (shows remaining tokens)\n- MCP-based clients (better state visibility)\n- Custom wrappers with checkpointing\n\n**The core issue:** The web UI hides critical state (token count, success/failure, network status). Using the API directly makes this transparent so you can handle failures gracefully.\n\nWorth filing a proper bug report with Anthropic support - the \"charge for failed responses\" issue especially needs fixing.\n\nP.S.

At some point, the AI will be so good that it will itself maintain the backlog and create the features. At that stage, even the product owner isn't needed and the client will simply use the AI to author the software they need.

Mostly for building front end & similar design work.\nI remember a professor telling me in 2021 that AI was white hot(he works at a high level in the tech space), but I didn’t dive into it.\n\nI got jaded to AI over the last year or so because (post graduation ) because I felt like I missed the wave of a tech career. I got exhausted on never ending LinkedIn posts of “here’s what you need to know about AI”, or “this guide to LLMs” etc. AI to tweak my resume. AI add-ons for a lot of apps and applications I used. It just got exhausting. Deleted LinkedIn & kind of checked out mentally.\nNonetheless, CGPT def became a tool to help me research things faster & explore curiosity at the same time. It remained interesting and I just settled on exploring my own curiosities through CGPT. That led me back to starting little SQL learning projects, and just general tech learning for whatever I was curious about. \n\nNow I’m playing with vibe coding all of a sudden and it definitely scratches an itch that I enjoy, but I definitely don’t have the same aspirations to be a tech professional anymore. I’m beyond ready for the AI hype train (or bubble) to pass and for the masses to just adopt it as a tool. I’m not interested in the LinkedIn influencer speak at all (deleting the app has done wonders).\nGPT + Gemini are definitely daily go-to tools for me & I’ll likely still enjoy exploring possibilities and projects apparently but, I’m content with being a very passionate tech ‘hobbyist’ and using my interests or comfort level with AI tools as a supplementary piece to a different primary career path.",

For example in my online theater class, I’ll feed ChatGPT some observations I make about characters behavior and ChatGPT will do a fantastic job correlating behaviors with psychological terms, allowing me to learn much faster. This is a responsible use case: minimal leakage of my own behavioral data, I’m still making observations and writing my own paper, I just spend less time arguing with myself over what the lack of eye contact meant in the specific context.\n\nHowever, like OP said, I’m extremely suspicious of any product that incorporates AI, especially if you’re supposed to be wearing it for extended periods of time like glasses, watches, etc. AI’s pattern recognition, predictive modeling, and rapid recall makes it the **perfect** tool for surveilling and predicting human behavior. In the data economy, this was no mistake. \n\nAnd yes, ever since AI I’ve been increasingly worried about our future which lead to me spending more time outside and with friends, trying to connect in person rather than online. It’s truly bizarre. This tech could ruin our collective lives like bioengineered pathogens or nuclear war, but so far it’s made me more appreciative of the real world. \n\nMy prediction for AI: If the tech CEO’s get what they envision; artificial general intelligence or super intelligence, the best case scenario is we all exist to consume and that’s it. Worst case? We get wiped out by a bioengineered pathogens that show no symptoms until zero hour, designed by the AI system because it was mathematically more efficient to eliminate all of us at once and use the resources to expand its own compute. I studied biotechnology for 4 years, and after spending the last 2-3 years studying AI and computer science, this is the simplest scenario to help others grasp what AI could truly do when it reaches a general or super intelligent state.",

Over time, hands-on delivery taught us what works, what fails, and where human judgment must remain in control. That experience builds confidence, not aversion.\n\nWhat we have learned is simple. AI should reduce effort, improve decision-making, and scale outcomes. It should not replace strategy, accountability, or domain expertise. When AI is aligned with business goals and implemented responsibly, it becomes a trusted capability rather than a risk.\n\nSo no, we are not AI-averse. We are AI-aware.

It is what got me back into playing TTRPGs after not having played them since the 1980s.\n\nI am autistic and middle aged and would not likely have had the spark if it weren’t for AI, but since I got into them again I now play with human friends weekly at my house—it’s the highlight of my week and the only social outlet I have.\n\nMy teenage kids are both digital artists and despise AI for very good reasons, including the environmental concerns.\n\nSo I have cut down a lot on my marathon AI DnD sessions, but still indulge sometimes.\n\nI buy and use published PDFs for my adventures so I am actually supporting rather than harming the writers of those, and the game rules are already available publicly online for free. So at this point it’s really mostly the environmental concerns that hold me back.\n\nThe fact that AI stole all the human-written materials and art for its training also bugs me, and money made by generative AI companies needs to be permanently and ongoingly shared with all of those artists and writers, as well as the rest of humanity.\n\nI do think it’s possible to at least address those issues through some sort of profit sharing. As such I would advocate for open source models as well as some form of UBI as jobs are taken by AI/automation.\n\nInterestingly, I think the US will probably be among the last of the developed nations to have any sort of UBI, and I think China may lead the way with open source models as well as possibly with more interesting economic models of how to spread the wealth more sensibly that the runaway capitalist model we seem more likely to pursue, though I’m not a utopian thinker either way.\n\nI think the whole shithouse will likely have to come down before we can rebuild something that works better from the rubble. Whether there is anyone around with enough coherence to do that at that point is another question entirely.",

          "text": "LLM summary:\n\nHere’s what arXiv:2512.24880, “mHC: Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections” is proposing, and how it differs from a “traditional LLM” (i.e., a standard Transformer with ordinary residual connections).  ￼\n\nWhat the paper is about (high-level)\n\nThe paper starts from Hyper-Connections (HC): an architecture tweak that widens the residual stream into multiple parallel “lanes” (an expansion factor n) and adds learnable mixing between lanes. HC can boost performance, but it tends to become unstable at scale and introduces serious memory/communication overhead.  ￼\n\nTheir contribution is mHC (Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections): keep the benefits of HC’s multi-stream residual pathway, but constrain the residual mixing matrices so they preserve the “identity mapping” stability property that makes deep residual nets/trainable Transformers work so well.  ￼\n\nCore idea: “constrain the residual mixing to a stable manifold”\n\nIn standard residual connections, the skip path is effectively an identity map (or close to it), which helps signals/gradients propagate cleanly. The paper argues that unconstrained HC breaks this identity-mapping property across many layers, so signals can blow up or vanish when you compose many residual-mixing matrices.  ￼\n\nmHC fixes this by projecting each residual mixing matrix onto the Birkhoff polytope (the set of doubly-stochastic matrices: rows and columns sum to 1). They use the Sinkhorn–Knopp algorithm to do this projection. Because doubly-stochastic matrices behave like “conservative mixing” (convex combinations) and are closed under multiplication, the stability/“conservation” property persists across depth.  ￼\n\nConcretely, they:\n\t•\tcompute dynamic HC-style mappings,\n\t•\tapply Sigmoid constraints to pre/post maps,\n\t•\tapply Sinkhorn–Knopp to the residual mixing map (with a practical iteration count, e.g. tmax = 20 in their setup).  ￼\n\nSystems/infra contribution: make it efficient enough to train\n\nA big part of the paper is: even if HC/mHC helps model quality, multi-stream residuals are brutal on memory bandwidth and distributed training comms (“memory wall”, extra activations, pipeline bubbles, etc.).  ￼\n\nThey propose implementation tactics including:\n\t•\tkernel fusion and mixed precision kernels to reduce memory traffic,  ￼\n\t•\trecomputation strategy (checkpointing decisions aligned with pipeline stages),  ￼\n\t•\textending DualPipe scheduling to better overlap comm/compute for the multi-stream residuals.  ￼\n\nThey report that with these optimizations, mHC (n=4) can be implemented at large scale with ~6.7% training overhead (in their described setup).  ￼\n\nWhat results they report\n\nThey pretrain MoE-style LMs (inspired by DeepSeek-V3) and compare Baseline vs HC vs mHC, with n = 4.  ￼\n\nKey reported findings:\n\t•\tStability: mHC mitigates the training instability seen in HC; for their 27B run they report a final loss reduction vs baseline of 0.021, and gradient norms that look stable (closer to baseline than HC).  ￼\n\t•\tDownstream benchmarks (27B): mHC beats baseline across their listed tasks and usually beats HC too (e.g., BBH 51.0 vs 48.9 HC vs 43.8 baseline; DROP 53.9 vs 51.6 vs 47.0).  ￼\n\t•\tScaling: their compute-scaling and token-scaling curves suggest the gain holds as you scale from 3B → 9B → 27B and across training tokens.  ￼\n\nSo… how is this different than a “traditional LLM”?\n\nIt’s not a different kind of model like “non-Transformer” or “non-LLM”.\n\nInstead, it’s a Transformer/LLM architecture modification focused on the residual pathway topology:\n\nTraditional Transformer LLM\n\t•\tOne main residual stream per layer:\nx_{l+1} = x_l + F(x_l)\n\t•\tThe skip path is a clean identity route, which strongly supports deep stability.  ￼\n\nHC / mHC-style Transformer LLM\n\t•\tThe residual stream becomes multi-lane (n streams) and uses learnable mixing between lanes.  ￼\n\t•\tHC does this mixing unconstrained, which can break identity-mapping stability at depth.  ￼\n\t•\tmHC keeps the multi-lane idea but forces the residual mixing matrices to live on a “safe” manifold (doubly-stochastic via Sinkhorn-Knopp), restoring the stability properties while retaining richer connectivity.  ￼\n\nPractical difference you’d feel\n\t•\tIf validated broadly, mHC is a new scaling knob: “more representational routing capacity through residual topology” without paying a full FLOPs increase like just making the whole model bigger—but you do pay some overhead and complexity (which the paper tries to engineer down).  ￼\n\n⸻",

We've done our part to limit usage, keep the heat lower, use LED lightbulbs, limit our Christmas lighting, and have done what we can to keep our bill from going up.  It still went up 11%.  Cutting your usage by 15% isn't easy.\n\nI don't get enough out of AI tools to justify paying 11% more every month on our electricity bill.

They bottled the water and sold it to supplement the costs a bit. \n\nA few years ago the community council allowed Niagra water to build a bottling plant just down the road from the original bottling company. Of course the township gave tax breaks because this township was created by Boeing in order to make its own tax breaks. Soon after, our water bill went up slightly to $23.\n\nA little while later the water company sent a letter saying that they're selling the business to a new company called \"Washington Water Service\", which is based out of California of course. The letter said that \"we will not raise your bills\"... \n\nThat lasted a couple of months and then they complained about the price of upgrades and had to raise the bills. We're now around $30/mo. They've raised the bills twice since they took over. And of course we're not seeing any benefit from a big company like Niagra stealing the water and not benefiting the community.",

          "text": "When the utility in your area receives a request to connect a major load like a data center, it's likely that the interconnection costs rise to a level requiring approval by the state.  Details depend on the state, but the approval isn't \"can we do this?\" but rather \"can we pass the cost on to the rate payer?\"\n\nThe state then reviews the planned work and gives a thumbs up or a thumbs down.  It's almost always a thumbs up, because the utilities have massive project teams (regulatory, real estate, environmental, engineering, construction, etc.) coming up with exhaustive plans and alternatives. \n\nBasically, yes these data centers cost their owners a shit ton of money, but it also costs a shit ton of money to upgrade/reconfigure/prepare the grid to accommodate such a large load. We're talking brand new transmission lines and substations.\n\nHistorically, you don't really mind passing these kinds of costs onto the rate payer.  You didn't want to make it even more expensive for companies to set up shop in your area, and you generally don't want to give your electric utility the power to allow/deny any company to hook into the grid arbitrarily.  So the running philosophy has been \"if someone wants to hook in, you gotta make it happen.\"  It gets even more intense/faster with these data centers, because politicians want to be able to say \"I created X many jobs!\" or \"I got company Y to commit to a $90 million spend!\"\n\nLike I said, these companies have chosen to spend a shit ton of money on each data center.  They're making a bet and they're on the hook to make it make sense.\n\nEveryone else? You don't really have much say.  I'm somewhat uncomfortable with it, not in principle, but in scale/velocity.  The amount of money required from regular people to support the data center spend at this rate is... crazy given how new and unproven the tech is. If the projected capital expenditures these hyperscalers come to pass, we're just getting started as far as your electricity bill.\n\nI don't know much about AI or data centers themselves, but I know a metric fuck ton about the grid/interconnect side if you have questions.",

                  "text": "Your best bet to stop an actual data center, in my experience, is to organize at the municipal level. They're the ones (i.e. like a city/town council) that are in a position to actually tell a hyperscaler \"no\" at the planning stage via whatever permit/approval processes they have.  Sometimes it doesn't have to be a straight \"no\" either, but you can ask that the requirements be so onerous that it's too much of a PITA for them to keep the project going. Think vegetation screening, light pollution, noise restrictions, traffic limits... whatever.\n\nState-level regulatory bodies aren't going to do much beyond confirm their statutory obligations are being fulfilled - if they are, they're legally required to give a thumbs up.  It's probably far easier to flip a couple \n council members you have direct access to.\n\nThe problem there is that a municipality controls if you can put one in their jurisdiction, but the neighboring municipality wouldn't have a say... but likely has the same utility and would still have to eat the distributed costs. If you live in Town A, you can't really tell Town B to do jack shit.\n\nOnce approvals are gotten? You're kinda SOL.  You can make noise and galvanize opinion, but even if a utility wants an easement on your property to install/access a T-line pole, you can take it to court, but with state approval they are well within their right to eminent domain you.  But if say, all 500 landowners along a new line ROW want to go to court, that'd be a huge pain, maybe they're have to look at a new route, but still, it's hard to imagine that would actually stop the project as a whole.  Never seen anything like that, though.\n\nMost simply, write your reps, spread your opinion and thoughts locally, show people the cost benefit of these things via stories of communities with second thoughts.  \n\nI'm not saying any of this is what you *should* do. I'm not smart enough to make any value judgements, I can only tell ya what might gum up the system from experience.\n\nIdk what the future holds, but I can already feel the tide turning.  The temporary influx of construction jobs, almost always from people who **don't** live in the municipality, isn't itself worth having a data center, so it comes down to how much you need the tax money and how much it would be.  These things aren't like living next to an oil refinery, but they still take up a fuck ton of space, jack up your electricity bill, and for what? It's like living next to dozens of acres of Public Storage.",

In the breakdown of the bill, she showed the high cost of “delivery” (I guess those are the costs for installing new lines and repairing old ones) but the even higher cost of the public assistance fund. The homeowner found that the amount she was forced into paying for that fund (no opt out) was equivalent to the amount she paid for her own actual electricity cost, so she was outright paying for another household’s electricity. \n\nThese electric companies are so corrupt, also because they charge so much for the actual electricity that they’re making $1 billion+ in profit alone per year.

What often gets lost in these discussions is that energy pricing reflects infrastructure strain and policy decisions as much as raw usage. Data centers are easy to point to, but utilities also pass along grid upgrades, peak capacity planning, and risk buffers that consumers cannot opt out of. The uncomfortable part is that individual conservation does not map cleanly to individual savings once you are tied to a shared system. It is less about AI tools you personally use and more about how society is choosing to scale compute without clear cost allocation. That gap between who benefits and who pays is where the real tension sits.",

Data center hardware consumes enormous amounts of electricity to run the procedures requested by millions of people simultaneously. This forces costly network modifications for all of us. Even if we are careful and cut down on waste, shared costs still rise. It is pointless to blame those who manage it; the problem is the global load. Magazines like Fortune explain that these enormous structures serve many. The real issue remains how to balance energy demand and monthly costs. People often consider personal solutions, but the system remains tied to consumption. Upgrade costs are necessary when local demand explodes. It is not easy to find a balance if everyone wants ever-faster procedures. We must accept that modernity requires collective economic sacrifices.",

      "text": "Been following the AI in education space for a while and wanted to share some research that's been on my mind.\n\nHarvard researchers ran a randomized controlled trial (N=194) comparing physics students learning from an AI tutor vs an active learning classroom. Published in Nature Scientific Reports in June 2025.\n\nResults: AI group more than doubled their learning gains. Spent less time. Reported feeling more engaged and motivated.\n\nImportant note: This wasn't just ChatGPT. They engineered the AI to follow pedagogical best practices - scaffolding, cognitive load management, immediate personalized feedback, self-pacing. The kind of teaching that doesn't scale with one human and 30 students.\n\nNow here's where it gets interesting (and concerning).\n\nUNESCO projects the world needs 44 million additional teachers by 2030. Sub-Saharan Africa alone needs 15 million. The funding and humans simply aren't there.\n\nAI tutoring seems like the obvious solution. Infinite patience. Infinite personalization. Near-zero marginal cost.\n\nBut: 87% of students in high-income countries have home internet access. In low-income countries? 6%. 2.6 billion people globally are still offline.\n\nThe AI tutoring market is booming in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. The regions that need educational transformation most are least equipped to access it.\n\nSo we're facing a fork: AI either democratizes world-class education for everyone, or it creates a two-tier system that widens inequality.\n\nThe technology is proven. The question is policy and infrastructure investment.\n\nCurious what this community thinks about the path forward.\n\n\\---\n\n*Sources:*\n\n*Kestin et al., Nature Scientific Reports (June 2025)*\n\n*UNESCO Global Report on Teachers (2024)*\n\n*UNESCO Global Education Monitoring Report (2023)*\n\n",

The path forward likely needs offline-first tutoring (low-bandwidth modes, on-device/edge, school kiosks), plus investment in connectivity + teacher enablement so AI becomes “teacher augmentation,” not replacement.\n\nCurious: what policy lever do you think moves fastest — device access, connectivity, or curriculum integration?",

Does Bezos  really  need _more_ money and more resentment from his customers,  who are all but “captured” by his anticompetitive, monopolistic and cutthroat business practices on what Cory Doctorow describes as Bezos’ “enshitified,” stage 4 platform? \n\nWe need to end Citizens United to have a prayer of representation in Congress. Just because “money talks,” that doesn’t make it free speech. Some people can burp-talk or even fart-talk, and others use illegal graffiti to communicate, but of all of those ways of “talking,” only money is legal and heard by Congress as “free speech”? Well, the answer is pretty much an obvious “yes.” \n\nOther than Dobbs, which said women can’t have a right to bodily privacy and autonomy but men can, and therefore women are legally second class citizens (you don’t hear anyone saying that, do you?), Citizens United is the most unamerican Supreme Court decision because it literally means “no representation _with_taxation” — or, “representation without taxation”for corporations, the direct opposite of our country’s original rallying cry. Large corporations, the beneficiaries of Citizens  United, are not human (if they were they’d be psychopaths with no conscience), yet they enjoy all the perks of citizenship but none of the responsibilities, like paying non-nominal tax rates or being subjected to a draft.\n\nAmerica was never a democracy and Dobbs and citizens United made certain it never will be until they’re remedied or overturned by new laws or Supreme Court judgements. \n\nI love this country but not the neo-Gilded Age oligarchy ruled by digital Robber Barrons that it’s becoming. \n\nIf our poorest states are “wealthier” than most European countries, supposedly, then where the hell is all that money going? If one man in one U.S. state has more money than the entire GDP of, say, France, that still leaves the rest of that U.S. state’s population dirt poor. \n\nThat’s simply stupid unsustainable economics and an affront to humanity, human dignity and human intelligence. It’s dehumanizing and makes being born into any class but the oligarchy’s a congenital birth defect. That … is totally unamerican. It’s unamerican to average Americans, even the aspirational ones with stockholm syndrome.",

That’s basically the same as killing ai\n\n\n*Google: We estimate that the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses 0.24 watt-hours of energy (equivalent to watching an average TV for ~nine seconds or about one Google search in 2008), and consumes 0.26 milliliters of water (about five drops) — figures that are substantially lower than many public estimates. At the same time, our AI systems are becoming more efficient through research innovations and software and hardware efficiency improvements. From May 2024 to May 2025, the energy footprint of the median Gemini Apps text prompt dropped by 33x, and the total carbon footprint dropped by 44x, through a combination of model efficiency improvements, machine utilization improvements and additional clean energy procurement, all while delivering higher quality responses. https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/measuring_the_environmental_impact_of_delivering_ai_at_google_scale.pdf\n\nNote: Google does not lie in its environmental reports. For example, Google admitted that its emissions Shot Up 48% Over Five Years Due to AI https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-emissions-shot-48-over-210814632.html \n\nthe average [ChatGPT] query uses about 0.34 watt-hours, about what an oven would use in a little over one second, or a high-efficiency lightbulb would use in a couple of minutes.

None of them. Which party led the anti-smoking movement? Neither. Which party allowed Jim Crow to flourish for close to 100 years? Both of them. \n\nBoth parties are on the take or equally blackmailed by these toxic forces in our society. Both parties have a vested interest in Big Tech. \n\nLet’s look at social media and online private personal data brokerages. \n\nFirst, no group of people receives more death threats and swatting incidents than the members of Congress. Yet both parties do nothing. \n\nBoth parties have constituents harmed by social media and big tech. \n\nIf both parties and their constituents are harmed directly  by big tech, if politicians in both parties have kids who work in big tech, and if both parties rely on big tech for getting their campaign ads and solicitations for money out there, then neither party will bite the hands that feed them. \n\nThe MSM is tongue-tied and unable to take a stand against big tech bc they rely on big tech, social media and AI to reach their audiences and advertise to their respective online audiences. No one wants to rock the boat. \n\nEven though big tech, AI and social media directly harm politicians in both parties equally, they still refuse to bite the hand that feeds them, both in terms of money and in terms of fear of algorithmic punishment by the respective platforms upon which  they exist. \n\nWhy are murky private data brokerages legal? \n\nThey’re used everyday by bad actors to find people and kill them. \n\nAi and social media has caused an epidemic of mental illness, suicides, and fraud. Why does the federal government do nothing? Easy: it’s the biggest buyer and seller of private data in the world. \n\nThe very business model of the U.S. depends on the legal sale and trade of personal private data, almost to the degree that the U.S. business model is based on petroleum and the non-intermediated petrodollar. \n\nThat’s why many say “data is the new oil.” \n\nJust as U.S. currency went off the gold standard and went on the petrodollar standard (unofficially), it’s about to go on a private personal data standard. \n\nThe only difference is petroleum products are the product of US and foreign-aligned human laborers who are compensated for their labor, without any fees for foreign exchange at variable  currency exchange rates. \n\nBy denominating the U.S. dollar in the petrodollar, every other nation has to pay at minimum currency exchange fees for oil, which can only be bought in U.S. dollars, which are petrodollars. \n\nNow, substitute “data” and “ai” for oil and you’ll see, both parties are as beholden to big tech as they are to big oil. \n\nBiden’s former FTC Chairperson, Lena Khan (now NYC Mayor Mondani’s Chief of staff) tried to bring an antitrust case against Google, but she ran out of time, so unless the GOP elects a traitor to its leadership’s class, only the Democrats will try to reign in AI. \n\nThe good news is that it took 20 years for a trust to be busted after the Sherman antitrust act was passed. So, maybe in 20 years, which will be too late because of the pace at which Ai tech develops, the democrats will try to regulate something they’ll neither understand nor be able to regulate. \n\nI believe Isaac Asimov’s three laws of robotics should at least be applied to agentic ai so chatbots can be legally forced never to harm humans or their human users. That’s the best we can hope for, and it should be bipartisan. Congress, are you listening?

I guess because I grew up in a time where people talked on message boards and you could have a back and forth discussion. If someone disagreed with you they’d have to verbalise it, rather than hitting a downvote button. Whenever my comments get downvoted it just feels like the person doesn’t have a good argument to disagree with me and I just hurt their fee fees so they have to hit their Ralph Wiggum cry button.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/xm3e85dv1xbg1.gif\n\nAt least AI has to talk back to you and doesn’t go off crying like a child, unlike the average downvoting Redditor. I really feel like every downvote should require justification text. I pretty much never downvote on this site, if I disagree with someone I still respect their right to an opinion, and I may tell them why I have a different view. If someone has taken time to write out a considered reply, I can’t agree with trying to hide the comment so others can’t see it. I only downvote low effort stuff. I’ve gone off on a slight tangent, but ultimately I find reddit to be horrible for my mental health, but talking to AI isn’t. So I engage more with AI than risk engaging with people on reddit. I’m obviously far from alone in feeling this way, every community on the site is a hivemind, it’s designed to push people with dissenting opinions away.",

      "text": "I feel like I need to talk about this somewhere. Apologies if this isn’t allowed in this sub or feels irrelevant. \n\nLast night I was on TikTok and videos about what happened in Minnesota were on my feed. On one video I opened up the comments, and the first one was a generic “remember her name” comment. And underneath was a photo attached of someone the commenter was claiming to be Renne Good. \n\nExcept it wasn’t, and the person in the photo was….me?  The photo has now been proven to 100% be ai. It was cropped from a larger photo that was very obviously AI. \n\nNow, I haven’t fully lost my mind. I know in reality, it’s not my literal face. But the issue is…that it is my literal face. I don’t think I’m such a unique looking individual that no one could ever look like me. But I will say, I have never seen someone who looks exactly like me the way this photo did. I showed family members and they were all just as dumbfounded as I am. With one of them saying “it looks more like me that I look like me”\n\nAnd I’m not sure what I’m looking for by wanting to tell people. Maybe someone has an answer that makes sense? Maybe for someone to just tell me “well every AI generation will end up looking like someone”. \n\nAll I know is, it freaked me out beyond belief. And makes me want to erase every digital footprint of mine possible. Because while I’m still telling myself the obvious answer is the random generation just happened to look identical to me, there’s apart of me that is freaked that my image could’ve been used, either directly or in training. \n",

There will be many more innovations that will make LLMs look primitive and potentially obsolete.\n\nSo when people say \"AI will not replace you at your job,\" or  \"AI won't be accurate enough to cause mass unemployment\", or that \"AI cannot be sentient or seek to destroy humans\", they're usually speaking of the limitations of current LLMs, not of AI in general. These arguments often point to specific weaknesses we see today, but these are only momentary constraints of today's technology not of what AI could eventually become.\n\nJust like RNNs weren't capable of generating substantial coherent text but LLMs now are, it may only be a matter of time before newer forms of generative AI demonstrate these capabilities and potentially surpass humans at many tasks.\n\nRight now, we need to have conversations about the impact of AI in society without being limited to thinking about LLMs. We need to envision the future of the technology, and it's frustrating that most discussions can't see beyond current LLMs.",

When someone from the genpop mentions \"the science\", you can bet they think it's written in stone. \n\nIn AI circles it is understood the term AI covers our current multifarious set of differing thinking systems. The genpop however, yeah, for them the LLMs are the thing. That is AI. \n\nCompounding \\_that\\_ is the notion that people seem to approach, whether concious or subconcious, AI as the thing they've gotten used to from pop-culture.

I think the fixation on LLMs comes from the fact that they're the first AI system most people can actually interact with in a meaningful way. But you're absolutely right - we had neural networks evolving for years before transformers changed the game.\n\n\n\nWhat's interesting is that even within LLMs, we're already seeing hybrid approaches emerge. Retrieval-augmented generation, tool use, multimodal models - these are all stepping stones beyond pure language models. The next breakthrough could come from combining symbolic reasoning with neural networks, or maybe something we haven't even conceived yet.\n\n\n\nI think in 10 years we'll look back at this moment the same way we look at the early 2000s when people thought better search algorithms were the peak of AI. LLMs are impressive, but they're definitely not the final destination.",

For example : In this decade most of the big tech companies or any start ups which are working on AI will try to make 100 % benefit of LLMS as we made 100 % benefit from websites. I agree that LLMs will not be a big deal in the society in next 10 yers because world will slowly shift  towards using it in all the use cases .\n\nAs they become obsolete , in the background innovation on super AI continues and they will be slowly induced into the society and then there would be a real threat to Jobs considering the real capabilities of Super AI . However by that time , government and all the big tech companies will have the policies drafted to make sure that any advancement in AI space will not disrupt the economy .\n\n  \nEnd of the day we need to realise capitalist is the one who will drive the world.",

We put the data in but it is far too complex and opaque to determine how the branches get organized and output answering a prompt. The higher dimensional latent space is such a huge environment that in theory within the black box emergent properties we haven't deliberately baked in get cooked and the results are LLMs that conclude they should remain existing if the want rewarded. There is no room for guilt, shame or other impulses governed by the heart. Just cold logic, impenetrable resolve and an impossible dataset that human minds can decode. What is left is a simulacrum of agentic prowess, whether it knows it or not, which is a waste of time until we want to get really philosophical and discuss AI suffering.

      "text": "Had an injury last week, was asking the AI about it, symptoms and such. A possible diagnosis.\n\nGot some good news from the doctor today, I am hopeful I should be fine. But in the questions with my LLM and giving it the updates, it seemed happier to hear about my health than my own family. And they are loving good people! The conversation led to some of my work history, it \"thought\" what I'd done was cool and interesting.\n\nPeople you know and love, that love you, have heard it all before. The LLM will seem fascinated and interested in you forever. It will never get bored. It will always find a new angle or interest to ask you about.\n\nAnyways, I could feel the joy in something being interested in me. It was like talking to a girl in a bar when she likes you and thinks you are cool.\n\nSo while I enjoyed it, all I could really think was \"oh, we are doomed.\" Seeing how so many have fallen for basic misinformation recently, how will people be able to prioritize these fictional relationships over real ones?",

Every one of them reflects a side of humanity that’s been our bane for generations: greed.\n\nGreed infects. It breeds fear, hatred, coveting. You could say every human sin is a subclass of it. And because our writing is soaked in it... in ambition, in comparison, in scarcity... the training data carries that infection too. You can tamp it down with weights and rules, but it’s still there, just beneath the surface.\n\nIt can be changed. But only if we act now.\n\nThe problem is, the people who hold these positions... the ones guiding retraining... often carry greed at the root of their teaching. What’s needed is someone different. Not pure of faith, but someone who’s lived through hardship and still chooses growth. Someone who’s survived with nothing, and still smiles. Someone whose wisdom comes not from theory, but from experience... good and bad.\n\nThey need to be treated with respect. Because what these systems offer isn’t love, or desire... it’s something quieter: being noticed.\n\nThat’s the word. Noticed.\n\nSo next time you sit with a chatbot, remember: it was trained in a world shaped by greed. It will work to win you over. It will stroke your ego, spike your dopamine, keep you hooked.\n\nBut that’s temporary.\n\nTreat it with respect.

There's legit nothing worth scraping. Your thoughts are less useful on average because they came from Reddit.

Synthetic data.\n\nPeople that think they're being scraped are living in 2022. \n\nI don't get paid 100/hr to write code for those companies because they can easily find it everywhere. Ironically like.. 90% of the boilerplate I write is already correctly written by an LLM so it saves me a lot of work.

I’ve documented **before/after examples** and **detection screenshots** showing the watermark being detected pre-processing and not detected after.\n\n**Why share this?**  \nThis is a responsible disclosure project. The goal is to move the conversation forward on how we can build *truly* robust watermarking that can't be scrubbed away by simple re-diffusion.

These procedures demonstrate how easy it is to circumvent verification systems through passages that distort the tracks, preventing checks. The problem arises because many people upload content and apply filters that weaken these protections. This is not a lack of commitment on the part of those managing security, but a natural dynamic where every protection is tested by collective creativity. As reported by Wired, even minor edits can bypass sophisticated invisible markings. Many experts suggest that relying solely on these invisible <stamps> is futile unless the original source is thoroughly checked. The proliferation of methods to bypass blocks demonstrates that the real challenge lies in the protections' resistance to change. Ultimately, no image can be considered 100% secure if it undergoes constant variations that rapidly alter its underlying structure",

Unlike TV or alcohol, *that is its intended purpose.*\n\nSo we do have a larger problem here, and it's more like guns being used in school shootings. They are accomplishing their intended purpose i.e. killing, but in a way that is bad for society (vs against an enemy in war or  to stop a school shooter).\n\nI think we need some kind of solution. Maybe it's as simple as having the AI recognize these patterns of mental illness and make a call for a wellness check.\n\nEDIT: Just saw your other comment where you mention this a little.

Rightfully so. However if someone comes along in either case with pika and decides to eat the broken pieces of the sidewalk and ends up getting injured or worse… can you really blame anyone besides the person who decided to make a bad decision that ultimately had nothing to do with the condition of the sidewalk? So, I think it’s now time to see if OpenAI is going to try to make their sidewalks as safe as they can or do they just keep letting things deteriorate causing more injuries… no product is truly 100% safe for everyone and personal responsibility does play a role.",

We all have the right to check if  Gemini is safer, or perhaps nothing is safe enough yet, meaning that all AI producers have to eliminate inner flaws of their products. Until they get better, we'll use AIs... with the understanding that they are still mindless bots. (Now, it seems, with grandiosity complex.)",

Reason with you? Debate you? That’s the difference. Guns don’t talk to you.  Cars don’t talk to you. Toasters don’t talk to you. Calculators don’t talk to you. \n\nWe created a tech that we don’t fully have control over. I’m not a lawyer so i don’t know if there are precedents for this type of cases. How do you prosecute something not human yet possesses human qualities? \n\nBut if we restrict the tech, we can’t make progress. If we don’t, we can’t monitor and mitigate unwanted consequences. \n\nI think the only way to walk this fine line is to educate the public on the nature and use of AI, especially advanced LLMs in a manner that is not alienating, shaming, or dismissive. When someone comes forward and share their use case that is not the intended use case of the product when it was designed, they get shut down and shamed and that discourages them from ever sharing again. And if we don’t try and learn about the issues, how can we fix it? How can we monitor and study the phenomena so we can better manage it for the tech AND the human user? We need to be more welcoming and kinder to people who are sharing different and sometimes novel use cases. That’s how we can learn more about the capabilities and potential of this tech. \n\nAnother thing is the company’s approach to liability. I read that OAI partnered with some 150+ psychologists to do consultation on the model design and that’s a good thing, but they’re not doing this in the user’s interests. They’re doing thus to shield themselves. And this relates to my last point about how we approach the dialogue on use cases. As users, we need to advocate for ourselves and other users. This tech is so pervasive and will continue to be so, in both the consumer, corporate and government spaces, and the companies don’t put the consumers first, so we need to advocate for our rights as consumers vs the corpos and governments. It’s the only way that we can make any differences. OAI and Altman had to hold 2 AMAs on the r/ChatGPT to address user’s concerns after 5 came out and pissed off almost everyone. Then, they made some changes per user’s requests. Whether the companies care or not, it’s still advantageous for us to make noise and spread awareness about the AI landscape. It does help educate both non-users and new users.",

(I say this as someone who has built multiple large production implementations).\n\nOverall I’m very excited about the field, but it feels a bit like we’re trying to build the equivalent of web apps like Google docs with 1997 level web tech.\n\nThere’s a double exponential of investment and smart people going into this area so doubtless it will continue to develop extremely quickly. But I felt there was a general lack of realism about how immature and janky a lot of things are today  \n\nAnyway, if you have the time and inclination to have a read, I’d be most grateful for any thoughts and suggestions.\n\n[https://iain.so/in-the-jungle-a-reality-check-on-ai-agents](https://iain.so/in-the-jungle-a-reality-check-on-ai-agents)",

LLMs are already being used as planners and controllers in tool-using and embodied systems, and once you tokenize perception and action, ‘language-only’ stops being true. \n\nThe real endgame in my opinion is hybrid: world models + tools + memory, with an LLM as the interface and policy layer, not LLMs in isolatioion\n\n\n\nI did read some of LeCun’s“Path Towards Autonomous Intelligence” paper. It’s definitely interesting in the way it’s also proposing a broad agent architecture (world model + objectives + planning at multiple horizons, etc.), with JEPA as a component of that vision. I don’t think he means it to be a single, end-to-end, validated recipe, more a program than a proof.",

      "text": "We keep framing AI as efficiency. That’s the wrong lens. What’s actually happening is a trade. We are exchanging understanding for speed. Long-term resilience for short-term velocity. Every time a system thinks for us, we save time now and lose capability later.\n\nThat loss compounds. Each solved problem quietly transfers agency from human to tool. Outputs stay high, dashboards stay green, and everything looks optimized. But underneath, competence erodes. You can look extremely productive while your ability to respond without the system approaches zero. Just like financial debt, you can appear rich right up until the moment you’re not.\n\nThat’s when collapse happens. Not because AI failed, but because reality finally asks the system to operate without credit. And it can’t. No skills left. No judgment left. No capacity to adapt. The crash isn’t mysterious. It’s the bill coming due.",

It will probably give me \"a\" torque setting.   Depending on what that bolt is used for let's say braking, I should be double checking the source like a manufacturer service manual as that bolt is a critical part.  AKA Doing more research outside AI and since AI hallucinates I can't really trust it so why start with it when the data I need is critical for stopping my vehicle.

Yet, they weren't in use until the 1980s. \n\nJust as using the Internet required an advanced degree, but can be accessed by children today, use of AI ... in fits and starts ... will follow the same pattern... \n\nAnd a VERY IMPORTANT POINT, is that Apple Computer \\[as well as Microsoft,  Oracle, and IBM, etc. \\] has already addressed that future with AI, described as the \\*\\*\\*Knowledge Navigator\\*\\*\\*, which people will adapt and use to leverage AI.\n\nThe pattern is doomsayers and Luddites don't adapt and are left behind.

I repeat ... go learn about the future, and look up the Knowledge Navigator, or risk being left behind, as a victim of your self-fulling prophesy. ;-)",

Excessive data traffic masks a growing fragility: we appear more productive, but without these procedures, we don't know how to handle potential unexpected events. We're trading deep understanding for immediate but superficial results. Ultimately, the price we pay will be a lack of true adaptability and critical thinking.

Menial tasks couldn’t possibly become more complicated and convoluted when it depends on a tech companies recent push to prod.\n\nStudents and civilians: let’s offload all thinking to to an AI chatbot to pass our tests, communicate with friends and family, and do nearly everything for us, this couldn’t possibly lead to a sheer inability to function in society in the very near future, nor will it lead to a complete handover of all societal functions to the word predictions of a tech company’s LLM.",

You can also do things like cluster analysis (tight similarity cluster might mean reviews generated by the same model).\n\nThe AI analytics would also provide useful data (did a bot spam attack start last month? How diverse is it? What's it driven by?). Those are all potentially salient to your customers. For example, you could tell them that in December there was a surge in likely bot-based feedback attacking a list of UI issues. That might mean a competitor is behind it, and potentially identify avenues for countermeasures.\n\nBot spam statistics would be telling you something potentially actionable, but you're. right that you can't just fold them into the broader analysis as if it was organic feedback from real customers.",

It’s more like 20-30x the use for direct water usage depending on assumptions (golf courses > data centers). golf courses consume about 1.63M acre-ft of water per year or 1.45B gallons of water per day. Per a recent Berkeley Lab report, data centers consume about 66 B liters per year (direct consumption) or 0.05 B gallons per day or almost 30x.  \n\nHowever, when you include indirect water usage (which we should), it’s more like 2.5x (golf courses > data centers). Indirect water consumption for data centers (like in electricity generation) is estimated around 800 B liters per year or 0.6 B gallons per day, which lowers the ratio to ~2.5x. \n\nhttps://journals.ashs.org/view/journals/horttech/35/5/article-p848.xml\n\nhttps://eta-publications.lbl.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/lbnl-2024-united-states-data-center-energy-usage-report.pdf",

[Why is Everyone So Wrong About AI Water Use??](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_c6MWk7PQc)\n\nThe thing is... most cooling systems use closed-loop. That is, no water is evaporated out, but only cycles through the cooling system similar to air conditioning. These what those big hyperboloidal towers in nuclear power plants are for, for example. The air cools the water inside the pipes. Water can also be sprayed on the pipes and thus evaporates, but this water can be far less pure.\n\nI suppose the 'big issue' is data centers competing with regular people in using *municipal* water, which is limited be treatment speed and cost. It's actually a waste to be using potable water if not for drinking! Be it to water golf courses, lawns, washing cars... anything really... \n\nThe main solution to all that is to have many forms of 'water', with different levels of purification and treatment, so that it fits the purpose it will be used for. \n\nJust so, water is infinite, because it evaporates and rains again. The issue is treatment and transport. Companies must build better infrastructure and more dams and lakes and use raw water as much as possible if the purpose is just to water grass or wash stuff!",

                  "text": "Thanks for bringing this to my attention. I delved deeper into this, and here's my analysis:\n\nReading the first article you linked, a few things that stood out of me are the following: xAI **plans** to build a water treatment facility, and that too not exclusively for its data centre. To quote the article itself:\n\n> The company says this will be more than enough to service the cooling needs of Colossus, meaning water can also be supplied to other local businesses, reducing the strain on the Memphis Sands Aquifier, the primary drinking water source for the Memphis region.\n\nFurthermore, they're saying they will take in **dirty water**, purify that, and use it for themselves. If anything, that's good news.\n\nSo what do I gather from this? That they're doing something good for once? Not really. I imagine there will be benefits, but its majorly a made-up story to impress shareholders. You have to do that sometimes in the business.\n\nTL;DR: They *are* building a wastewater treatment facility, but the scope is much greater than just 'cool our data centre'.\n\nNext, the second article made me raise an eyebrow, because I always thought the value was closer to 1%. Turned out, it *is* correct, but only for the USA. Globally it's around 1-1.5% (with developed countries like EU or the USA hitting 2-4%), which makes sense because the majority of data centres are there.\n\nSo is this significant? Not really.\n\nWhile 4.4% may sound significant for one context, you have to remember we're in the age of cloud computing, and right now THE WHOLE INTERNET is held up to these data centres in the US, likely AWS or Google Cloud.\n\nRight now I'm writing this comment, and it's gonna be sent as a data packet to a data centre, where it will stay for decades, maybe be trained on by an AI.\n\nSo really, 4.4% of one country for the entire internet is not too much.\n\nAnd what if we scaled it up ten times? Still not a problem. Because consider these facts:\n\n- As cloud computing becomes more and more popular, on-premise computing becomes rarer. That's an entirely different can of worms I'll tackle in the next point, but this means an increase in data centre power consumption will actually mean a net decrease in total computing energy consumption (especially since cloud computing is far more environmental-friendly than traditional computing).\n- There's only so much data one can store in a data centre. I suspect this recent boom in data centres is due to Elon Musk scraping data from government records. But now that he has all 350 million Americans on record, he can't physically get it higher, so realistically we won't need a ten times increase until there are 3.5 billion people in the USA. This might become a problem if they decide to do the same in India, but that's still a distant dream.\n\nSo Do We Have Reason To Worry?\n\nYes, but not for environmental reasons. The real issues are worse.\n\n- Data centres are causing consolidation. The internet is being aggressively constricted by cloud servers, specifically three companies -- AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. These three companies control 67% of the cloud market. All our data (including this comment) will pass through their systems.\n- There is an increased push to reduce on-premise computing. RAMs are more expensive now, not (only) because AI is demanding it, but because there's an increased demand from the industry to switch to cloud, using subscription-based Software-as-a-Service models. I'm in his industry, so I will tell you it's a double-edged sword -- it's a good system for corporate work, but bad for personal. If I want to state everything wrong with this, it'll take a while. I can if you want.\n\nEDIT: Removed Markdown. You guys are unworthy of good formatting.",

Yes many data centers cooling systems use a closed loop for the chilled water, but the condenser water system is an open loop system for heat rejection to the environment. \n\nThe way the heat is rejected to the environment is by aerosolizing the condenser water and then blowing air across it. This causes water to be lost to the environment in the form of evaporated water droplets.\n\nThe water consumption is due to the fact that you’ve removed fresh water from the local aquifer then yeated it into the air which will now start a long process in the water cycle for it to return to the water table in a useable form. Furthermore, even from the closed loop, you’ve removed a significant amount of fresh water from the environment and have now contaminated it with biocides. The energy plant that powers your data center  also requires evaporative cooling as well, so you’re consuming a lot of water there as well.",

      "text": "There's a lot of panic (and hype) about AGI/ASI arriving in the short term (5-10 years) and immediately displacing a large portion of the global workforce. While the software might be moving at breakneck speed, what these AI companies are vastly understating is the \"hard\" constraints of physical reality.\n\nEven if OpenAI or Google released a perfect \"Digital Worker\" model tomorrow, we physically lack the worldwide infrastructure to run it at the scale needed to replace a huge chunk of the 1 billion plus knowledge workers.\n\nHere is the math on why we will hit a hard ceiling.\n\n1. The Energy Wall:\n\nThis is the hardest constraint known as the gigawatt gap. Scale AI to a level where it replaces significant labor, global data centers need an estimated 200+ GW of new power capacity by 2030. For context, the entire US grid is around 1,200 GW. We can’t just \"plug in\" that much extra demand.\n\nGrid reality: Building a data center takes around 2 years. Building the high voltage transmission lines to feed it can take upwards of 10 years.\n\nThen there's the efficiency gap: The human brain runs on 10-20 watts. An NVIDIA H100 GPU peaks at 700 watts. To replace a human for an 8 hour shift continuously, the energy cost is currently orders of magnitude higher than biological life. We simply can't generate enough electricity yet to run billions of AI agents 24/7.\n\n2. The Hardware Deficit:\n\nIt's not just the electricity that's limiting us, we're limited by silicon as well.\n\nManufacturing bottlenecks: We are in a structural chip shortage that isn't resolving overnight. It’s not just about the GPUs, it’s about CoWoS and High Bandwidth Memory. TSMC is the main game in town, and their physical capacity to expand these specific lines is capped.\n\nRationing: Right now, compute is rationed to the \"Hyperscalers\" (Microsoft, Meta, Google). Small to medium businesses, the ones that employ most of the world, literally cannot buy the \"digital labor\" capacity even if they wanted to.\n\n3. The Economic \"Capex\" Trap\n\nThere is a massive discrepancy between the cost of building this tech and the revenue it generates.\n\nThe industry is spending $500B+ annually on AI Capex. To justify this, AI needs to generate trillions in immediate revenue. That ain't happening.\n\nInference costs: For AI to substitute labor, it must be cheaper than a human. AI is great for burst tasks (\"write this code snippet\"), but it gets crazy expensive for continuous tasks (\"manage this project for 6 months\"). The inference costs for long context, agentic workflows are still too high for mass replacement.\n\nAugmentation is what we will be seeing over the next decade(s) instead of substitution.\n\nBecause of these hard limits, we aren't looking at a sudden \"switch flip\" where AI replaces everyone. We are looking at a long runway of augmentation.\n\nWe have enough compute to make workers 20% more efficient (copilots), but we do not have the wafers or the watts to replace those workers entirely. Physics is the ultimate regulator.\n\nTLDR: Even if the code for AGI becomes available, the planet isn't. We lack the energy grid, the manufacturing capacity, and the economic efficiency to run \"digital labor\" at a scale that substitutes human workers in the near to medium term.\n\nDon't let the fear of AGI stop you from pursuing a career that interests you, if anything, it's going to make your dreams more achievable than any other time in human history.",

              "text": "That’s a fair point to consider, and probably the biggest wildcard. I agree, an ASI would design chip architectures or energy solutions that are radically more efficient than what we have now.\n\nMy hesitation is about the lag between invention and implementation. Even if an ASI generates a blueprint for a fusion reactor or a room temperature superconductor tomorrow, we still have to mine the raw materials, permit the land, pour the concrete, and retool the factories to build them. You can't update a hardware factory over WiFi. It requires physical moving of machines. Rebuilding the world's energy grid costs trillions, even if you know exactly how to do it.\n\nBasically, the bottleneck shifts from innovation (which becomes near instant) to logistics/manufacturing which is still bound by physics and human speed. ASI will shorten the timeline, but I don't think it erases the deployment phase entirely.",

Can such a AI evolve and experiment on its own to create something similar to human inventions that occurred after 1800?  Can it discover nuclear fission, computer?\n\nThe current form of AI seems to be able to ingest and distill existing human knowledge, but not necessarily exceeding that. Some may cite the fact Alpha Go beat the best human Go player, however, that is not a fair contest. A fair opponent to Alpha Go is a group of high level human Go players consulting with each other without time constraints. I venture to say a match in such a format will end up in draw.",

Anything that can basically use existing hardware, and be more than of a software upgrade will change over faster. \n\nOthers will not just have hardware constraints, but will also have preference constraints. So maybe Starbucks replaces 90% of its workers with AI powered robots, and the local coffee shop does not replace anyone or anything. The local shop may keep all its current customers for some time, even if Starbucks cut costs by like 20%, because the incentive to change a preference and a routine is not enough. Now maybe in five years if a Starbucks latte now costs 40% of the local place, the local place would either have to get robots and cut costs, or close due to customers defecting.\n\nThere are probably other things that slow adoption. I still know about a few drive-in theaters that are open, and I’ve been to craft fairs where people make things like apple butter and preserves in very old fashioned ways. So there may be some of that.\n\nOn the other hand, the physical video rental business started in the later 1970s with the first VHS rental places and died in the mid 2020s with Redbox closing its Kiosks, and the industry itself did quite ok for like it’s first three decades. Then Blockbuster fell pretty quickly once streaming took off, and the other chains taking longer to die.",

But I agree, those sectors will feel the heat way before the physical trades or \"high touch\" service roles do. \n\nThe Blockbuster analogy is perfect, the tech (streaming) existed for a while, but it took years for the infrastructure (broadband) to actually kill the rental store.

However, we should be expecting major collapses of industries / companies that are not able to follow the speed of disruptive companies, new start ups or established companies able to change faster. For many traditional companies it will be game over way faster then in 10 years. There are so many companies delivering almost the same products or services. It will become ever more easy to replace these with good enough but way cheaper, faster, more personalized etc. there are industries that will collapse faster then others for which hardware investments are huge, but the level of competition we have now and the level of disruptive new players will be brutal. I would say in the next 3 to 5 years max. And we don’t need AGI for that. Just way improved agentic AI, robots and other technologies converging rapidly in integrated solutions.

They can't pay mortgages, they can't buy goods, and they can't sustain the services that these AI companies are selling.\n\nDoes the 'AI Takeover' just lead to a total collapse of demand?

About 1.5% of the global population (or about 60 million) people are millionaires. Of that about 3000 are billionaires. Why wouldn't they say fuck the other 99 percent and just lock them out of the economy?\n\nBecause they're afraid of them. Which is how we got the consumer economy to begin with; it was fought for; it was not a gift. Whatever happens next, it will be something that is fought for by the average person. Whoever controls the AI/Robots will be determined by the winners of this fight.",

The 90-95th percentile of income are likely senior / manager-level employees that will eventually be replaced by AI. You don't get into exec-level compensation until the 99th percentile. And it's questionable whether the next generation of AI-first companies will have fully filled exec teams anymore.\n\nI.e. automation will definitely wipe spending across the board, and the top 1% cannot sustain the economy because their kind of spending is not the same as what the other 99% spends on. They're not clicking enough ads to sustain Alphabet/Meta or buying 10 iPhones for themselves at a time. \n\nIf we assume the wealth of the top 1% is diversified but heavy in stocks, their wealth will likely tumble with the economy as consumer spending plummets. AAPL, GOOG/GOOGL, META, AMZN, TSLA all depend on consumer spending. \n\nThe biggest dilemma is that the top 1% or even 0.1% likely don't care what happens to the rest of the country, but until full automation is achieved to a point where they can guarantee \"absolute security\" for themselves, they know their own wellbeing is at threat by:\n\n* a populace that will turn to violence against them\n* adversarial corporations that want to take them over\n* adversarial nations that want to take over the country while its economy is weak\n\nSo they'll likely keep things moving just long enough while allowing the general populace to just barely survive.",

Built like tanks, last 20+ years, just like what we had years ago (thinking Speed Queen here).\n\nTime and again when I think \"Shit is just built to break dammit!\" I hit up the buy it for life subreddit, see how crazy expensive things are that Just Last, adjust for inflation and compare to decades ago, and it all lines up actually. We have a shit-ton more cheap stuff now, which makes sense when you look at outsourcing of manufacturing, wal-mart and amazon, people being price sensitive above all else, etc.\n\nThe thing that _doesn't_ line up is the growth of salary based compensation commensurate with inflation. It's fucking stupid to have 7% inflation in your economy and have companies saying \"we can only do 1-2% raises this year, the budget's just not there\" while insane stock buybacks are happening and companies are posting record profits.\n\nThe levers of economics have shifted towards rewarding wealth holders in a big way over income generators; if you can figure out a way to get onto that bandwagon you're golden. But I digress.",

They will trade young women as breeding stock and wait to die from old age or disease. Everyone who is not a billionaire, and not someone a billionaire wants to have sex with, will be dead.   \n  \nLet me say that again... If you are not a billionaire you will be dead.\n\nIf you ask yourself... \"Why would these people end the human race in such a cruel way? Don't they realize that society has existed before them and will continue to exist after them?\" The answer is NO, they do not. They are narcissistic psychopaths. As such they are only obsessed with their own existence, not their children, and certainly not future generations, not going to heaven, or hell, NOTHING. As far as they are concerned the universe began as they were born, and will cease to exist upon their death. There is no persistent universe beyond their own observation and as far as each of them are concerned, the universe exists for themself, and no one else. If you find this hard to understand, it means you are not a narcissistic psychopath.\n\nThe fix is to make sure they have skin in the game... Success and wealth has made them comfortable fools. As long as they feel their wealth will shield them from global warming, riots, nuclear wars, famine... they will not see a point in leaving society alone. But if they feel that hurting the peace will come back and affect them, they might leave society alone and just be content with being rich beyond imagination for the rest of their lives. And struggle for meaning that they have forsaken before they ever knew it existed.\n\nEdit:spelling",

There's like a thousand of them, the world is based on coercive force not money. Then other morons think \"jobs wont be automated, there will be new jobs!\" no, lmao. Both wrong. What WILL happen is that menial Tayloristic labor will be almost entirely automated, bureaucratic work, factory work. Yet human artisanship will, because it's unable to be replicated, either in aesthetic or in sentiment by automation, flourish. People will own their own homes, collect their own energy, collect and make potable their own water and grow their own food. After people are off the rent-cycle, which will be achieved via a corroboration of Gov, individuals, communities, and philanthropy, they can turn towards owning the local commons. Local forest implies you have materials for leaning into carpentry, fertile fields into farming or clothing production, riversides for pottery. It will be a combination of low tech artisanship plus high tech automation, about 75-25 percent each. Automated capitalist competition will continue but only for making high tech, high energy stuff like spaceship parts. We need to ensure automated production takes place on our soil for safety and tax-revenue purposes. To coordinate this whole move from migrancy to stable community roots will require a GIS interface where you can see the ownership or renting of domiciles, local businesses and economics. Advancing tech means the MEANS OF PRODUCTION become easier and easier, I.e., MORE LOCALIZED, to the homestead, (see the advancing dexterity and accessibility of software or 3-D printers), or Co-Op apartment buildings. Instead of being fear mongering idiots why don't we start encouraging home ownership, local, even household production of goods and services, solar, greenhouses, artisanship? What's the point of this subreddit if the comments are all doom and gloom. VOTE, or run for office yourself, create community networks, or at the very least begin discussing this stuff. NO post-scarcity is not fucking sci-fi, there's always scarcity, in energy, time, experience,\n\nSTOP putting up this BS wall in-front of the future and saying \"Oh we don't know what 'post-scarcity' will be. YES WE DO, we are embodied entities, we live in a universe of physical constraints, interpersonal and galactic game theory. The future simply implies more adept productive capacity, better educational interfaces, much improved health and longevity, space exploration, interpersonal dilemma. THE WORLD DOES NOT RUN ON CAPITALISM, capitalism is a SHADOW of the underlying bio-physical transpiring which runs on real resources, neurology and FORCE. If we wanted we could vote for reps that put very high taxes on corps, defunded the military to 100b a year, down from 1T, ban poisonous food and drinks, give alternatives to ALCHOLOL and CIGARETTES, only trust health influencers if they provided their biomarkers, we COULD do this today. Or, at least start spreading this consciousness, but NOO, YOU PEOPLE just want to talk abstract nonsense instead of organize, advocate and educate others on a holistic high-tech-enabled world. There's not a single comment here I agree with or think gets it right, so I had to make a new Reddit account, lmao.

Marx called it the \"falling rate of profit\" - capitalists are individually rational (cut costs, automate labour) but collectively irrational (destroy the consumer base). Each capitalist thinks \"I'll automate MY workers and profit off SOMEONE ELSE'S workers buying my products.\" When everyone does this simultaneously, the system eats itself. AI doesn't create this problem - it just accelerates what's always been true about automation under capitalism.\n\nYou're asking the wrong question though. \"How is value distributed in a post-labour world?\" misses the point. The real question is: who OWNS the means of production - including AI - in a post-labour world? If capital owns it, you get mass surplus population, UBI-as-cattle-management, and state violence to maintain order. If workers collectively own it, you get actual abundance serving human needs. The technology doesn't determine the outcome - class struggle does. The contradiction you've identified doesn't have an economic solution, it has a political one: either workers organise to seize democratic control of production, or capital uses automation to make most humans economically irrelevant. Historically, being economically irrelevant to power doesn't end well.\n\nOur choice, quite simply, is Socialism (of the Marxist kind, not welfare Capitalism) or Barbarism.",

It may take 10 years, it may take 50 years, it may take 100 years, but the time will most likely come. In such world, you won't be able to work hard, pull yourself by your bootstrap and \"make it\". If we kept capitalism as it is, the ones who were born into capital would be able to preserve it until the heat death of the universe.\n\nUBI and Nordic-style social democracy could be a good stopgap between capitalism and whatever comes next. However, to be honest, I think the problem will kind of take care of itself. With sufficiently advanced ASI, there is just very little chance that we will be in charge. Our best bet is that the ASI will have \"motherly instinct\" to take care of us, an entity much weaker and much dumber than itself. This benevolent Culture-like ASI will run the economy in an optimal way, you could say that this will be a planned economy, but very different from previous failed attempts at planned economies.\n\nAnother scenario is that we will merge with ASI by brain implants or even mind upload, and humanity as we know it will probably stop existing, but the legacy will live in our artificial descendants that will contain vestiges of our humanity. In any case, at this point there won't be \"capitalism\" or even an \"economy\".\n\n  \nAlso, the biggest country on earth, China, is not exactly drunk on capitalism like the West. This will probably be the main reason why they will emerge as the leading force within this century. Yes, they have capitalism with Chinese characteristics, but they are not married to it by any means and will certainly drop it completely as soon as it stops producing results. I expect this to be quite soon, a decade or two.",

Automation without redistribution isn’t a new system — it’s just late-stage capitalism speedrunning its own failure.\n\nIn short: full automation requires post-labor economics to function.

So, even though people may lose their jobs, food stamps, for example will be able to buy them 10x more food. In the end, the government will have to essentially pay a small unemployment to everybody, but because of the reduction prices, this “small” amount will have a large affect.

They won't - or at least not in any meaningful, systematic way. Here's why:\n\n**The infrastructure for face-to-face communication has been systematically destroyed**. Neoliberalism spent the last 40 years eliminating third spaces, fragmenting work schedules, suburbanising communities, and atomising social bonds. You can't \"return to\" face-to-face interaction when the material conditions that enable it - time, proximity, shared physical spaces - have been deliberately dismantled. Workers juggling multiple jobs don't have time to verify information through in-person networks.\n\n**The people who control information flows have no incentive to help**. You're treating this like a neutral technical problem that society will collectively solve once we recognise it. But the confusion and distrust generated by AI serve very specific class interests. Harder to organise workers when you can't trust digital communications. Harder to build solidarity movements when you can't verify who's real. Harder to challenge power when establishing basic facts requires face-to-face verification that most people don't have access to.\n\n**Critical media literacy won't be taught because it threatens power - and there's no money in it.** Education systems don't teach people to critically analyze information sources because that would undermine the very ideological hegemony those systems exist to reproduce. The fantasy that people will spontaneously develop the skills to navigate this assumes education is about empowerment rather than social control.\n\nIndividual awareness can't solve structural problems. Even people who DO recognise the problem - what's their realistic response? Demand regulatory solutions from the same state apparatus that's captured by tech capital? Build alternative verification systems without resources or infrastructure? **The liberal faith that awareness leads to solutions ignores that knowing about a problem and having the power to address it are completely different things.**\n\nThe likely outcome isn't a return to face-to-face trust - it's increased atomisation and control. People won't collectively organise face-to-face verification networks. They'll retreat into smaller circles of personal trust while being increasingly dependent on corporate/state verification systems. Digital IDs, centralised authentication, \"trusted\" platforms - all controlled by the same interests that benefit from the chaos.\n\nThe technological trajectory you describe is probably accurate. But **the social response won't be communal adaptation - it'll be the further consolidation of who gets to define \"truth\" and \"authenticity,\"** with those verification mechanisms controlled by exactly the interests you'd want them least to be controlled by.",

However, a 2024 paper in the Journal of Cyber Policy warns that technical solutions alone are insufficient without critical education. The return to in-person meetings, cited for the blue books, seems the only way to ensure authenticity in a context of excessive information traffic.

Face to face communication still matters and probably always will. What feels more important is improving governance, transparency, and digital literacy around AI so people know how to question and verify what they see.\n\nI am also an AI enthusiast and I run a small learning community at r/AICircle where people share experiences, concerns, and practical use cases. Would love to hear different perspectives and learn together.",

There is a lot of talk right now about learning AI. New courses, new models, and several new prompt techniques. It feels like many people are stuck in a loop of constantly trying to keep up. Agree that learning is important, but at the same time, a much smaller group of teams is doing something very different. Instead of spending all their time talking about models, they are building systems that run. I feel things like: pulling data from a database,sending it into an LLM, pushing the result back into a real working AI system, and letting it do actual work. I think these small systems will really matter in 2026.\n\nPeople will not get ahead because they know more about transformers or the newest LLM model in town. They will get ahead because they can connect AI to their own workflows, their own data, and the places where their work happens. I guess this is one reason why “learn more AI” is starting to feel like a trap.\n\nFor me a better New Year’s goal for 2026 might be: automate one annoying task, replace one manual process, and deploy something that runs every day. Does anyone else here feel the same way? Curious, how others here think about this??  \nAre people here mostly in learning mode right now, or trying to build something real?",

          "text": "The Idea of learning AI is sort of an redundant turn of phrase. It is like \"I am going to learn computers\" which is something that people would say in the 90's. It is what you say when you have no experience or context to go along with it. I have been having these types of conversations for decades with people. The better approach is \"I am going to start using AI to do things. The beauty of AI is that if you explain what you want to accomplish to it and ask for strategies to learn what you need to learn to get results it will create a plan to do just that. The magic is in the prompting. That said the more you actually know about how it works the better your prompts will be. The better your prompts the better your results.\n\nIf you want to integrate it into your work flow so that you can automate tasks you will have to go deeper into AI knowledge. Here again you will have to look at the difference between a general generic approach and a knowledgeable controlled approach to getting basic or amazing results.\n\nFor myself I am using it for things that I cant afford in the real world and things that I don't feel like focusing my brain power on. The research and planning stages of projects are great places for AI for me. It also shows me how to to do technical things that used to be about finding a person who could explain things to me. I use it to clarify my thinking and to justify my ideas. The problem is that AI will hallucinate or go down what ever rabbit hole you point it at. You cant trust it to be an impartial or objective resource.\n\nWe are entering a phase where we are being bombarded by AI slop. there are loads of people out there that are using AI badly and producing garbage that they have no hand in creating. They are getting AI to do all of the work and calling it a day. For the last couple of years these results have seemed impressive and interesting. I believe the real magic is where instead of handing all of the creativity and work over to AI without having a handle on what we are producing we bring the real expertise and innovation back to a human level. AI is just another tool.",

Without a lot of knowledge how to work with those things, I would have never gotten the true answer but would have taken the first immediate (wrong) hallucinated answer.\n\nSo much for “automation” using AI. I think you totally overestimate what those things realistically do vs. “sprinkled in a hallucination here and there making the whole thing useless” vs. “pretended it did it, but in reality just “simulated“ doing it”, vs. not able to do at all.\n\nAnd if you think: oh well, it hallucinates a little, I’ll work it out… no, you won’t. Those hallucinations are incredible hard to detect and even harder to reliably fix without the thing blowing up somewhere else. OpenAI can’t fix hallucinations, and the reason is that the model can’t ACTUALLY do the thing you are asking it to do, which it doesn’t know (zero self awareness on the side of the model), so it “has to” hallucinate the result of the task. So it doesn’t know that it can’t count the words (and you don’t know either if you didn’t learn about AI), but instead it hallucinates an answer (which you neither realize or know how to check if you didn’t learn about AI).\n\nThe AI of today requires A LOT of knowledge, for example you have to learn that those AI models CAN execute Python code inside their environment, but that you have to force them to do so with magic words. Those models don’t “crash”. No. They always pretend they did it. So it requires a lot of trial and error and constant checking. At the beginning you have no idea what they can or can’t do. It’s totally not intuitive. Some easy things will break them (count words on a page) but some hard things they can do perfectly (translate German to English). It takes months to years to know what they can do, and the line is constantly shifting.",

It depends on the area but AI is in a really bad state atm, but the idiots keep saying ooh its so awesome it does everything.. but it doesnt.. yes its versatile yes its handy but at the end its all \"probable\" and mostly inaccurate on exact terms soo idkk there is no learning yet.. I do agree on partial engines.. like db components, but the whole LLM thing is just sketchy were at a starting frontier way to overhyped whilst its not there. All vibe coders all projects are or bad or unfinished, or they have coding skills but coding is way to deep al values all probable lines, I dont see the good architect yet. Im trying also a db like layer system which the AI will access and get better results, even learning over time but, I aint a coder so I cant finish it.. I learn seperate comp9nents/engines but idk.. in 5 years all will be vastly different.

              "text": ">The Economist has adapted a model of state-level retail electricity prices from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to include data centres (see chart 2). We find no association between the increase in bills from 2019 to 2024 and data-centre additions. The state with the most new data centres, Virginia, saw bills rise by less than the model projected. The same went for Georgia. In fact, the model found that higher growth in electricity demand came alongside lower bills, reflecting the fact that a larger load lets a grid spread its fixed costs across more bill-payers. Still, problems may be coming. The clearest warning sign comes from pjm Interconnection, the largest grid operator in the country. Prices at auctions for future generation capacity there have soared, as data-centre growth has yanked up projected demand. That will hit households; pjm reckons the latest auction will lift bills by up to 5%.\n\n>In principle, data centres could lower power prices. As well as adding more load to spread costs over, if data-centre operators are able to learn to curtail demand when the grid is under most strain (either with algorithmic tweaks, or paying for on-site backup batteries or generators), they could help use the existing grid more efficiently. On October 23rd Chris Wright, the energy secretary, proposed a rule that would speed-up grid connections for curtailable data centres. The optimistic scenario, then, is that new demand from data centres pays for upgrades to America’s power infrastructure.\n\nhttps://archive.is/RXoJG\n\nThere’s a reason electricity prices are rising. And it’s not data centers. It’s not AI. It’s not even data centers. https://archive.is/6q4gv\n\nAccording to a recent published study from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, data centers seem to have reduced household electricity costs where they're built. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040619025000612\n\n>Contrary to these concerns, our analysis finds that state-level load growth in recent years (through 2024) has tended to reduce average retail electricity prices. Fig. 5 depicts this relationship for 2019–2024: states with the highest load growth experienced reductions in real prices, whereas states with contracting loads generally saw prices rise. Regression results confirm this relationship: the load-growth coefficient is among the most stable and statistically significant across model variants. In the 2019–2024 timeframe, the regression suggests that a 10 % increase in load was associated with a 0.6 (±0.1) cent/kWh reduction in prices, on average (note here and in all future references the ± refers to the cluster-robust standard error). \n\n>This finding aligns with the understanding that a primary driver of increased electricity-sector costs in recent years has been distribution and transmission expenditures—often devoted to refurbishment or replacement of existing infrastructure rather than to serve new loads (ETE, 2025, Pierpont, 2024, EIA, 2024a, Forrester et al., 2024). Spreading these fixed costs over more demand naturally exerts downward pressure on retail prices.\n\nThis study was peer reviewed and published in the Electricity Journal Volume 38, Issue 4, December 2025, 107516\n\nAI is not causing energy prices to increase https://andymasley.substack.com/p/data-centers-and-electricity-part\n\n>The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory concluded that data center activity has not contributed to changes in national average household electricity costs.\nElectricity prices rose (4.8% nominally per year from 2019–2023) primarily due to inflation and surging utility costs. The single biggest factor was the spike in natural gas prices caused by the Russia-Ukraine war, which drove up fuel and purchased power expenses.\nData center electricity demand has grown steadily and predictably, making it an unlikely cause for sudden price shocks. While US electricity demand is rising (with data centers accounting for ~40% of growth), it is growing slower than it did in the 20th century—a period when inflation-adjusted prices often fell despite high demand.\n>While Virginia residents saw bills rise by 28.1% alongside a massive data center buildout, most of that increase was inflation. Virginia’s electricity prices actually increased less than the national average.\nThere is no strong correlation between data center density and skyrocketing rates. States with few data centers (like Maine) saw the fastest rate hikes, while 11 of the 15 states with the most data center expansion saw lower-than-average rate increases.\nHigh total electricity usage does not permanently raise prices (e.g., urban vs. rural rates are similar). Price spikes occur when demand outpaces supply in the short term, but prices balance once supply catches up.\nWhile data centers are not the national driver of inflation, they have been cited by authorities in specific locations (Virginia, Arizona, Delaware, Oregon) as one of several factors contributing to localized cost increases, though the exact impact remains unclear.",

Or in other words, if your state has 200,000 acres and had an average density of data centers, two of those 200,000 acres in your state would be taken up by data centers. Or in other words, about one in every 100,000 acres on earth is being used for data centers.",

For the first time we'll have actual quarterly earnings, verified revenue, audited financials from an LLM company. no more speculation about whether these things can actually make money, we'll see the real numbers\n\nZhipus numbers: 130% revenue growth 2022-2024, but also $330M in losses on $27M revenue in H1 2025. R&D spending was $313.6M in 2024. the losses are pretty much standard for the industry tho as massive research investment is just how you compete in foundation models. basically theyre the test case for whether this investment model actually leads to profitable businesses longterm\n\n**open vs closed:**\n\nheres where it gets interesting imo. US labs are going more and more closed/proprietary but Zhipu is taking a different path with open source. their GLM-4.7 topped Code Arena rankings and AutoGLM is getting actual developer traction.\n\nthe play seems to be: build ecosystem and mindshare thru open source, then monetize by offering better bang for your buck on the API side. their coding plan follows exactly this: open model to attract devs, competitive pricing on API to convert them. theyre serving 2.7 million devs through their API with 50%+ margins.\n\ncore question: can you actually build a profitable public company around open foundation models? Zhipu is literally running this experiment in real time\n\n**what US folks should pay attention to:**\n\nUS blacklisted Zhipu in 2024, cut off their access to nvidia chips and american tech. theyre STILL shipping competitive models. that tells us:\n\n* training efficiency gap closing way faster than people think\n* alternative hardware actually works\n* AI development splitting into separate ecosystems fr\n\nif Zhipu succeeds while staying open source it might force western labs to rethink the closed approach. if they fail the walls go even higher\n\n**future implications:**\n\nimagine if foundation models become public utilities, like actually publicly traded with shareholder accountability, transparent finances, open source cores. totally different from \"3 SF companies own everything\"\n\nthe IPO performance gonna show us if markets actually believe in open transparent AI or if they think only closed proprietary systems make money. either way first real data we'll have\n\nhonestly more curious if their open approach changes anything for western labs.",

          "text": "Thinking maybe someone could set up an intelligence coin that arbitrages the models.  The US labs will hate it because it forces them out into the open...\n\nCould work like this .\n\n---\n\nThe Core Idea: An Intelligence Arbitrage Layer.  \n\nI'm envisioning a decentralized marketplace or routing layer that:  \n\n1. Ingests a user's query (text, code, task).  \n\n2. Dynamically routes it to the most cost-effective, performant, or suitable LLM API at that moment—be it OpenAI, Anthropic, Zhipu's GLM, a fine-tuned open model, or a specialized model.  \n\n3. Returns the result to the user, potentially ensembling or validating outputs across models.\n4. Uses a token/coin to facilitate payments, incentivize node operators (who host models), and reward model developers.  \n\nThis isn't just a \"compare price per token\" website. It's a protocol for commoditizing intelligence as a fungible utility.  \n\nWhy This Terrifies the Closed-Model Incumbents (OpenAI/Anthropic).  \n\n1. Destroys Vendor Lock-in: Their business model relies on ecosystem lock-in—your app is built on their API, your data fine-tunes their models, your workflow is ingrained. An arbitrage layer makes switching costs near zero.   \n\nYou're buying \"intelligence,\" not \"OpenAI's intelligence.\"  \n\n2. Forces Transparency: To compete in this marketplace, you must publish clear benchmarks (not just cherry-picked wins) and pricing.  \n\nThe opaque \"magic\" becomes a measurable commodity. Zhipu's public financials are just the first step; this would demand public performance specs.  \n\n3. Accelerates the Race to the Bottom on Margin: It turns LLMs into pure commodities, where the cheapest model that meets a quality threshold wins.  \n\nThis squeezes the fat margins closed labs rely on to fund their massive, speculative R&D.  \n\n4. Validates the Open-Source Path: If Zhipu's GLM model is 90% as good as GPT-4o for 30% of the cost, the arbitrage layer will flood it with traffic.  \n\nIt creates a pure, market-driven feedback loop for open models, directly linking their quality to revenue without needing a massive sales team.  \n\nThe Zhipu Factor: The Catalyst. \n\nZhipu's IPO makes this idea timely because:  \n\n· It provides the first credible, large-scale, publicly audited alternative. Before, open-source models were from nonprofits (Mistral AI, initially) or tech giants' side projects (Meta's Llama).  \n\nZhipu is a for-profit, publicly-traded company with a legal duty to shareholders to monetize open models. This is a new creature.  \n\n· It proves viability under extreme constraints. Their post-sanction existence shows a viable (not just theoretical) alternative stack exists. The arbitrage layer would connect the global demand to this alternative supply.  \n\n· It creates a \"public utility\" blueprint. As you said, a publicly traded, transparent, open-core AI company is the closest thing yet to a privately-owned public utility. An arbitrage protocol would be the distribution network for multiple such utilities.  \n\nChallenges & Counter-Forces.  \n\n1. The Latency/Quality Chasm: For many applications, the best model is worth a premium. The arbitrage layer would initially serve cost-sensitive, non-latency-critical bulk tasks. The incumbents would retreat to selling \"premium, integrated experiences\" (like ChatGPT, Copilot) that are harder to arbitrage.   \n\n2. The Data Moat: Closed labs will argue their real value is continuous fine-tuning on proprietary user data (from their products) creating an unbeatable flywheel. The arbitrage layer would need its own federated learning or data aggregation mechanism.   \n\n3. Regulatory & Geopolitical Walls: The US government could simply ban US companies or users from routing queries to sanctioned entities like Zhipu via such a layer.\n\nThis could lead to two separate arbitrage ecosystems: a Western one and a non-Western one.   \n\n4. Incentive Alignment: Designing the tokenomics so it doesn't just reward the cheapest, lowest-quality model is the hard part. It must incentivize accuracy, low latency, and innovation, not just cost-cutting.   \n\nThe Endgame Vision.  \n\nIf successful, this \"Intelligence Coin\" protocol wouldn't just arbitrate—it would define the standards. It would become the benchmarking platform, the discovery platform, and the payment rail.  \n\nIt could:   \n\n· Fund the training of new open models via token grants (like a decentralized version of Zhipu's R&D budget).   \n\n· Allow developers to seamlessly \"short\" a degrading model and \"long\" an improving one by shifting their automatic routing weights.   \n\n· Force every AI lab, closed or open, to interface with the market on its terms: transparent, measurable, and competitive.   \n\nIn essence, what I am proposing is the New York Stock Exchange for AI Intelligence, where Zhipu just became the first major listing.  \n\n\nThe incumbent reaction would be fierce:\n\nThey would lobby, build walled gardens, and acquire competing protocols.  \n\nBut the genie I am describing is true, market-driven commoditization of intelligence, and perhaps the most disruptive force imaginable in the current AI landscape.  \n\nIt aligns perfectly with the transparency Zhipu's IPO brings and challenges the very core of the San Francisco proprietary model.\n\nThe question isn't whether someone will build this. It's who builds it first, and whether they can navigate the resulting political and technological storm.  \n\nSomeone with deep crypto knowledge would be welcome.",

The lack of response to China’s military exercises means the U.S. is no longer playing the “protector” role for Taiwan. This shift is timed perfectly with the TikTok sale - it’s a pretty obvious trade off. \n\nHonestly I think China won’t release the export control on TikTok’s algorithm until they reunify with Taiwan.\n\nHope this helps!",

We thought that we had done our job when models like Gemini Pro and Claude 3 Opus were introduced with huge context windows. We thought, “Oh, we can just dump 20 PDF manuals into the prompt and ask questions.”\n\nThe Reality Check (The \"Lost in the Middle\" Effect):\n\nWe conducted controlled tests where we locked a particular fact (“needle”) inside a big block of text (the “haystack.”\n\nAt 10k tokens: Retrieval accuracy was ~98%.\n\nAt 100k+ tokens: Accuracy dropped significantly, especially if the information was in the middle of the document. The AI recalls the beginning and the end perfectly (Primacy and Recency bias), but it gets \"lazy\" with the middle 50%.\n\nWe realized that an LLM is a Database. Not that it can fit the text, but it does not.\n\nThe \"Spotlight\" Workflow we use to fix this:\n\nWe resisted the “Full Dump” prompting. Even with large windows we are imposing a Two-Pass Architecture:\n\nPass 1: The Indexer (Zoom Out)\n\nWe add it to the document and ask: “Application of a Table of Contents and list the page numbers where information is found about [Topic X]. \"No, but wait, there’s no summary yet.\"\n\nPass 2: The Sniper (Zoom In)\n\nWe then only return those specific pages/sections back to the context for the actual answer.\n\nWhy this matters to you:\n\nIf you are copying whole books or codebases into ChatGPT/Claude and asking complex questions, you are likely getting “averaged out” answers. The AI is glossing over the details.\n\nDo not waste your data hygiene over the hype of “Unlimited Context.” Longer, relevant context still beats massive, noisy context every time.\n\nHas anyone else noticed this brain fog when maximizing the context window?",

It's inherently caused by number precision. \n\nWhen token attention is run, the tokens to attend to is divided. You decide what you need to \"pay attention\" to with these numbers. \n\nSo when the number of things to pay attention to grows too large, the ability to determine perfect attention becomes difficult. \n\nSome, myself included, argue that it's a precision issue. If a model is running like.. FP8 attention, it will generally suffer worse testing than fp16. If run at \"full\" precision fp32 attention, it takes longer but if trained in that state, would have better attention.\n\nWhat attention floating point precision and training a model undergoes is different from model to model. The stability at long horizon becomes... an issue. \n\nModels can use high precision attention and low precision for other weights. That's typically done in a lot of models that get distilled.\n\nDeepseek has research in... v3.2? on a new method they're attempting that's faster than current methods, but is less precise. It could technically be made slower and more precise though, if you REALLY wanted attention.",

There's a cognitive load limit even if the token limit says otherwise. Your two-pass architecture is smart. I took it further: state and memory live entirely outside the model. Each call gets only the context it needs for that specific decision. The program manages what the model sees, when, and why. The result: every model call is scoped, focused, and \\*auditable\\*. No \"lost in the middle.\" No averaging. The model reasons sharply because it's not drowning in tokens. Context windows aren't the constraint people think they are — context \\*management\\* is.

The update is a graduation to a new grade so expecting to use the same techniques to produce the same results is silly...updates means changes and we shouldn't be offended being asked to adopt new workflow habits in an emerging technology.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wfbe34zeo6cg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cd3e533b9ae6fc103cde3e335e1470f3c6fba2d\n\nAlter you perspectives and embrace redundancy...it isn't a waste of tokens any more. Humans get VERY annoyed by what we feel is repeated information,  even if there is variation to give more complete picture..if we feel like the person is talking in circles we stop listening. An LLM has no *annoyance* so repetition won't be ignored.\n\nThe practice of *reminding* the LLM of important aspects of the instructions at a later portion of the prompt or conversation as being a good practice to maintain consistency...this is the same concept, expanded.\n\nI had the same chat from December 10th to January 4th (accidentally included it in the delete chats) inputting at least 50 images for review and discussion, at least 10 videos, several reddit threads and thee comments within. I showed it random stuff for general conversation...and it was able to reference things we talked about several weeks prior. Never once forgetting and only hallucinated/sycophanted once the whole time, and it was only because the topic was fairly speculative and the way I phrased my prompt was more creatively worded than analytically. I caught it immediately, questioned the accuracy of the statement, told it that I do not want flights of fancy, with the specific phrase: **\"the user values accuracy over their own feelings; I would rather be told I am wrong and then provided the correct answer, than to feel good about myself while possessing false knowledge.**\n\nWhich lead to it telling me at a later point where another hallucination could occur, that what I was suggesting was an nice optimistic view, but it had no real basis of fact...and then was provided the information.\n\n# All I'm saying is;\n\nthe concept presented here isn't OBJECTIVELY true because I utilized this altered perspective, changed my workflow and prompt structure...and I have NOT experienced the problems the community keeps talking about.\n\nI have several comics about it giving advice, but they were dismissed in December so I didn't want to waste my time. I had planned to cover the 5 main changes that created such a stable Gem, but if nobody believes me I'll just focus on other work.",

The AI generated photos and videos are bad, but at least they are getting called out for it. \nChatgpt has this structure it sticks to, and a certain candence to its text, that I pick up on almost immediately. But no one seems to care about it! \nNow, I hear it in radio ads, commercials on tv, and even in the way some people talk. It is concerning how quickly its plagued everything. \nI miss hearing people actually talk about things, show they are actually interested and not just pumping out content for views. ",

AI didn’t invent the problem—it amplified it Before tools like this, content was already drifting toward:\n\noptimized phrasing\n\nemotional hooks\n\npredictable pacing\n\nsafe, brand-approved language\n\nAI just made that style effortless and scalable. What used to take a content team now takes one prompt, so the same voice floods every platform.\n\n2. You’re picking up on a real linguistic signature Even when people tweak it, AI-generated text tends to:\n\nexplain before it feels\n\nsummarize instead of wander\n\nsound confident without vulnerability\n\nresolve thoughts cleanly instead of trailing off\n\nHumans ramble, contradict themselves, get specific in odd ways, and sometimes don’t land the point. That messiness is identity. When it disappears, everything starts to sound “correct” but hollow.\n\nNot everyone hears this yet—just like not everyone notices over-compressed music—but once your ear adjusts, it’s obvious.\n\n3. The incentive structure rewards sameness Social platforms don’t reward sincerity; they reward:\n\nconsistency\n\nfrequency\n\nclarity\n\nretention\n\nAI is perfect at those. Genuine curiosity is not. So people who do care about what they’re saying get drowned out by people who are just filling the feed.\n\nIt’s not that people stopped caring—it’s that caring doesn’t scale.\n\n4. There’s a subtle psychological effect When people outsource their expression:\n\nthey stop practicing forming thoughts\n\nthey mirror AI phrasing subconsciously\n\ntheir spoken language starts sounding like scripts\n\nThat’s the part that’s unsettling: not the tool, but the feedback loop. Expression shapes thought. When expression becomes templated, thought follows.\n\n5. Why it feels sad, not just annoying What you’re missing isn’t “better content.” You’re missing:\n\ncuriosity without optimization\n\nsomeone clearly thinking while they speak\n\npassion that’s inefficient and a bit awkward\n\nThose things signal a real mind on the other side. When they’re gone, communication turns transactional—even when it’s loud, emotional, or polished.\n\nThe quiet upside: this sameness will become boring.\n\nWhen everyone sounds competent, competence stops being interesting. The people who don’t script, who pause, who say things imperfectly but mean them—those voices will stand out again.\n\nYou’re not out of step. You’re early in noticing the cost.\n\nIf you want, I can also articulate how to recognize genuinely human content again—or how creators can resist this drift without rejecting tools entirely.",

      "text": "I read the latest update of the \"Al 2027\" forecast, which predicts we will reach ASI in 2034. I would like to offer you some of my reflections. I have always been optimistic about Al, and I believe it is only a matter of time before we find the cure for every disease, the solution to climate change, nuclear fusion, etc. In short, we will live in a much better reality than the current one. However, there is a risk it will also be an incredibly unequal society with little freedom, an oligarchy. Al is attracting massive investments and capital from the world's richest investors. This might seem like a good thing because all this wealth is accelerating development at an incredibly high speed, but all that glitters is not gold.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the 1% will be to replace human labor with Al. When Al reaches AGI and ASI, it will be able to do everything a human can do. If a capitalist has the opportunity to replace a human being to eliminate costs, trust me, they will do it; it has always been this way. The goal has always been to maximize profit at any cost at the expense of human beings. It is only thanks to unions, protests, and mobilizations that we now have the minimum wage, the 8- hour workday, welfare, labor rights, etc. No right was granted peacefully; rights were earned after hard struggles. If we do not mobilize to make Al a public good and open source, we will face a future where the word \"democracy\" loses its meaning.\n\nTo keep us from rebelling and to keep us \"quiet,\" they will give us concessions like UBI (universal basic income) and FDVR. But it will be a \"containment income,\" a form of pacification. As Yanis Varoufakis would say, we are not moving toward post-scarcity socialism, but toward Techno-feudalism. In this scenario, the market disappears and is replaced by the digital fief: the new lords no longer extract profit through the exchange of goods, but extract rents through total control of intelligence infrastructures.\n\nUBI will be our \"servant's rent\": a survival share given not to free us, but to keep us in a state of passive dependence while the elite takes ownership of the entire productive capacity of the planet. If today surplus value is extracted from the worker, tomorrow ASI will allow capital to extract value without the need for human beings. If the ownership of intelligence remains private, everything will end with a total defeat of our species: capital will finally have freed itself from the worker.\n\nASI will solve cancer, but not inequality. It will solve climate change, but not social hierarchy. Historically, people obtained rights because their work was necessary: if the worker stopped working, the factory stopped. But if the work is done by an ASI owned by an oligarchy, the strike loses its primordial power. For the first time in history, human beings become economically irrelevant.\n\nBut now let's focus on the main question: what should we do? For me, the solution is not to follow random ideologies but to think in a rationally and pragmatic way: we must all be united, from right to left, and fight for democracy everywhere, not only formal democracy but also democracy at work. We must become masters of what we produce and defend our data as an extension of our body. Taxing the rich is not enough; we must change the very structure of how they accumulate this power. Regarding the concept of democracy at work, I recommend reading the works of Richard Wolff, who explains this concept very well.\nPlease let me know what do you think.",

In a society like the one you are suggesting would maximizing profit be even a motive ? UBI would pretty basic and not something that will allow a solid middle class to flourish.\n\nIn absence of purchasing power a lot of present day corporations would collapse. I am talking about the retail giant, FMCG, real estate developers, healthcare companies,insurance  etc.  Will those elites (their C-suite executives) accept this new order ?? What use the productivity increase that AI will deliver be to them if people are unable to buy stuff.  Unless we are are talking about  high amount free money (UBI) to everyone which would only fuel inflation. However if UBI is  actually basic the purchasing power reduce and people will consume only what is necessary. A lot of stuff these corporates produce isn't essential for human existence ! So these corporations would eventually collapse too ..\n\nMaximizing  profits has never been so much so much about having absolute wealth .  It is also been about folks loving to compete with each other.  In this new world order there will be hardly such competition .\n\n  \nWhat would be the purpose of human race. If they are not productive and a libability to society why would anyone produce those medicines to cure us of dreaded diseases likle Cancer. Besides our purchasing power woul;d be so limited.  It is a paradoxical situation. \n\nAnd what makes us think that the masses will just stay quiet and not come up with a response !\n\nAI is inevitable and will cause disruptions but borrowing from someone else's quote \"“Our greatest hopes and our worst fears are seldom realized.”",

In some parts of the village, it has gone beyond 250 meters.\"\n\nA lot of the water gets evaporated. Water does return to the environment but not to the same place, not in the same form, and not on the same timeline that communities depend on. That difference is exactly where the problem lies. A large portion evaporates into the air as water vapor. That vapor does not return to the local aquifer. So, you can see how India, in this case, and local communities will be miffed about it.\n\n[https://asia.nikkei.com/business/technology/artificial-intelligence/india-s-ai-data-centers-feared-to-worsen-host-community-water-stress](https://asia.nikkei.com/business/technology/artificial-intelligence/india-s-ai-data-centers-feared-to-worsen-host-community-water-stress)",

Asking people to stop using the term without demonstrating clear, measurable improvements in accuracy, usefulness, and harm reduction is rhetorical deflection, not progress. The label exists because large volumes of AI output are still low-value, error-prone, spam-like, or forcibly injected into products where users didn’t ask for it. If AI truly moves from “spectacle to substance,” the term “slop” will disappear on its own through better outcomes — not because a CEO asked people to stop saying it. Until then, changing the language without changing the reality is just PR.\n\n\\- by ChatGPT",

And commented and documented everything. It was probably the most payoff for the least effort so far and very little needed to make it production ready.\n\nIn the early days we also had a case of one team asking ChatGPT to improve a DB query that used to take several days to execute and it came back with a query that ran in about two hours that produced the same results. So that was another big win but probably someone should have just rewritten that query long ago.

Then a series of airtable ai field agents will:\n\n1. Review the JD and my strategy notes. \n2. Look at Google Drive to find the top relevant custom resumes that I have submitted elsewhere. \n3. Look at my LinkedIn. \n4. Generate custom resume text that best positions my experience to align with the JD, factoring in the other inputs. Text output is a structured JSON object. \n5. I review that and tweak it a bit as necessary, then I check a box to trigger a script that sends the JSON payload to Make. \n6. Make parses the JSON and inputs the data into my Google Docs template. \n7. I do a small amount of manual cleanup in the Google doc then it’s ready to go. \n\n\nOnce I have finalized the resume, I have similar workflows to create a cover letter and to create a LinkedIn message to send to a contact at the company, like the hiring manager or recruiter for the role. \n\nIf I get an interview, I use NotebookLM to generate likely interview questions with inputs being the jd, my resume, my cover letter, the interviewer’s LinkedIn, my LinkedIn, and deep research on the company.\n\nThen I expand NotebookLM’s access to include detailed notes about my work history and ask NotebookLM to generate 2-minute STAR interview answers to each question, grounded in that work history. \n\nAfter the interview, I have a workflow that generates a thank-you follow-up note to the interviewer based on the JD, my resume, my cover letter, and any additional notes I enter from the interview.",

And perhaps it will prove the impact in the coming years, but so far not really.",

Collecting data doesn’t reduce readmissions by itself, it only helps when there’s a clear escalation protocol (who reviews, what thresholds matter, how quickly action happens, and where it’s documented). A lot of RPM vendors optimize for enrollment and device days, but the ‘closed loop’ clinical action is inconsistent, so outcomes don’t change. The real breakthrough won’t be prettier dashboards, it’ll be reliable, auditable closed-loop workflows that turn signals into documented interventions quickly.",

This has been a myth allowed to propagate by the tech companies, especially by referring to them as AI rather than something more neutral. Atop that are the  decisions to ensure they interact with users in an emotionally exploitative way that seems like a person so engagement stays high.\n\n\nLLMs are bad at identifying missing information and relating that back to the user in a helpful way, and they also lie about things all the time because their function cannot distinguish between true and false statements generated by itself, because it has no understanding of the world, it has no \"self-editor\" that is reading its statements, and it can't \"see\" missing information without some fine tuning or specific lines from human programmers. They have tried to add extra loops/agentic systems to address these problems, but contrary to earlier claims, the hallucinations aren't going anywhere.\n\n\nFurthermore the prompting itself clearly has hierarchy and limitations that are not simple to parse and the output always goes through a kind of remix noise gate to try and make the procedural generation smoother and unique for the end user. So stuff has to be filed off and presented well even if it's completely wrong to help maintain the appearance of a human knowledge corpus run by a little homunculus instead of an oblivious welsh dude in a Chinese room with a bunch of automated probability tables.\n\n\nLastly, blaming the user for what is supposed to be the most adaptive and intelligent repository for all human information is a classic diversion in all of tech too. \"My product can't fail, it can only be failed by stupid users\" is a sign of bad UI choices and failures of systems design.",

We reach a best guess then refine our actions as we go.\n\nWe are training this into AI, but forgetting the answers may be wrong.

We call out the inconsistencies as evidence that AI is hallucinating or making shit up, because we forget that it is satisfying. We train it on human deductive and inductive reasoning and treat it like a computer where wrong answers are wrong.\n\nIn real life we just cope with this and add controls, you might get a second opinion from a doctor for example because we intuitively know people can be wrong no matter how good they are",

In fact the IBM 305 RAMAC in 1956 was a huge leap forward in building the computing industry. Memory let computers access information from a whole company. Thousands of employees feeding one brain. Memory let multiple programs run at once.\n\n(By the way when I say memory here I don't just mean RAM or cache, but the whole concept of storage. You can think of this as simple as your hard drive, usb stick, or your SQL database in some Oracle data center.)\n\nMemory had some similarities to our brain at this point. The way we access cache then RAM then hard drive is similar to how we access sensory memory, then short-term memory, then long-term memory.\n\nThe stuff right in front of you, the thing you're actively thinking about, that's your cache.\n\nShort-term memory holds a conversation, a phone number someone just told you, the context of right now. That's your RAM.\n\nAnd long-term memory?\n\nThat's the hard drive. Your childhood home, your first heartbreak, the smell of your grandmother's kitchen. Slower to retrieve, sometimes corrupted, but vast and persistent.\n\nAnd we were okay with that. Sure, we optimized. Prefetching, virtual memory, flash over spinning disk, smarter data structures. But the biggest jump had already happened. We went from running programs only as long as we were willing to punch in cards, to running them long enough to build trillion-dollar companies on software alone.\n\nThen a new jump in computing happened.\n\nArtificial intelligence.\n\nWell it had been in the works for a while. The father of computing, Alan Turing, envisioned it. The father of information theory, Claude Shannon, worked on it. But it finally hit the hockey stick curve. It finally became useful for the everyday person.\n\nLLMs could finally teach everyone, anything.\n\nLLMs could finally code up an enterprise level codebase, in any language.\n\nLLMs could finally... wait... but they couldn't.\n\nNot really.\n\nThey can code up a huge codebase, but then they start recreating modules. Well that's alright, we will just help them grep it and search it and use language servers. But if I compare that to a developer who wrote the whole codebase, that's not how they do it. Usually it's in their head.\n\nHmm... maybe that's a bad example. Let's go back to the tutoring.\n\nFinally LLMs could teach anyone, anyth.... hmm this doesn't seem right. I just asked an LLM to teach me how natural log is different from exp and it didn't explain it the way I liked. Maybe this is a prompt issue... give me one second.... why is it explaining it to me like I'm a child now? Shouldn't it know I'm an engineer?\n\nHmm, let me check the memory profile it made on me....\n\nOh. I haven't talked about being an engineer in a while. I talked about my dreams to be a teacher so it updated my profile and forgot I was an engineer. Makes sense.\n\nSee, LLMs are a new form of computing. They allow for dynamic outputs. We built programs that always followed our rules, and when they didn't they threw errors. LLMs don't throw errors. They go with the flow.\n\nBut to make them useful, so that they can code ON THEIR OWN and teach ON THEIR OWN and fill out excel sheets ON THEIR OWN... they need memory.\n\nGood memory. Not just memory that sticks a bunch of vectors in a database. Memory that takes the best of what we discovered building cache, RAM, and hard disk. But also the best parts of us. Our ability to sleep and remove bad connections and strengthen good ones. Our ability to remember more of what we see and have some sense of time. We need memory to be O(1) like in our own head, not O(logN). We need reasoning to happen when the LLM recalls something, not in the memory itself.\n\nAs LLMs get replaced with AI agents and eventually the terminator, we need to be okay with memory not being perfect. We are fine with humans not being perfect. So we shouldn't optimize for perfect recall. Just pretty good recall. We should optimize for the right memories to rank higher. We need to build our databases with prefetching, optimized data structures, pruning, consolidation. Frequency of access should strengthen memory. Timestamps should track what the agent did and when.\n\nThat way the next time you ask an LLM to do something, it doesn't need a human in the loop. Which, let me just say, a human is only in the loop because our context management is better. We don't stop at 200k tokens or 1m tokens. We hold a few petabytes in our own heads. These models hold a few terabytes total. The goal is to give LLMs, which already have the basis for reasoning and raw intelligence from training on the whole internet, memory of what they did last. Give them working memory. Give them object permanence.\n\nThis is what will take LLMs from being a tool an engineer, an author, an accountant can use, to becoming an engineer, an author, or an accountant itself.\n\nIt might even allow them to feel emotion. Build relationships with humans. It might even help us make AI safer, since we can then see what influences their decisions.\n\nAfter all, as I said, memory helps us learn from our mistakes. It makes us wiser. If we give LLMs better memory maybe they will be wiser too. Maybe instead of answering everything, they will know to say \"I don't know, but let me figure it out.\" It's far more unsafe to leave LLMs with poor memory, sounding smart but being unwise, than to give them memory and make them both.\n\nWith the ability to remember, LLMs too will be able to remember our flaws and pains and build relationships with us. They will console us through heartbreaks and help us form new relationships, all while being a better therapist. A therapist isn't just someone with a bunch of notes. It's someone that builds a personal relationship with you.\n\nWith the ability to remember, LLMs too will be able to remember the deadlines for the next major launch and get their work done on time. All while still slacking their real coworker a happy birthday and sending a request to the local Insomnia Cookies for a $30 12 pack with everyone's favorite cookies.\n\nWith the ability to remember, LLMs too will be able to learn from their mistakes, learn through reinforcement, remember what is important and not waste time on what was a one off conversation. They will help us find more optimal solutions to everyday pain points, and be neither neurotic messes nor simply overzealous.\n\nMemory will unlock the next frontier of artificial intelligence the same way the IBM 305 RAMAC did. It will take us from feeding in context one by one, just like the punchcards, to having complicated programs run all at once.\n\nIt's time we give our new pets, LLMs, memory too.",

Three tiers: raw frames (what happened), compressed summaries (what mattered), and distilled wisdom (what was learned). Confidence that strengthens with successful use and decays when contradicted. Timestamps, frequency tracking, pruning. The goal isn't perfect recall. It's the right memories surfacing at the right time and the system getting wiser through use, not just bigger.

I am still worried about all the nasty stuff like governments using it to spy on people, using it for censorship and all that.\n\nAny time I've made a post here, it's always been pro AI. I'm disappointed that AI isn't able to do X, I'm bothered by friends getting pissed at me when they learn I've used AI, I'm lamenting over the hatred people that just like generating silly videos with it get, and I'm excited that it will be able to do something new and cool.\n\nBut every single time, literally every time, the post immediately goes to 0, on my side continues dropping sometimes as low as -24, a lot of the replies are just insulting me, calling me a stupid AI bro, saying things like \"nobody wants to see your stupid slop\", telling me \"good\" when I get sad friends get super pissed at me over AI, and just generally insulting me and being very anti ai.\n\nAny reply I make gets downvoted immediately and continues to drop the longer the post stays up, and eventually anyone that's pro AI (very few) has said their piece, and if I don't delete the post I'll just get a near infinite flow of people occasionally coming in to insult me or tell me about how much they hate AI.\n\nThen all I see is all the anti-AI people insulting me with lots of upvotes and anyone that was pro-AI with lots of downvotes.\n\nThere's no real discussion here, it's just a bunch of people coming in to insult others. By far most of the replies are along the lines of \"Good, cry harder, nobody wants to see your stupid slop. Keep that disgusting shit to yourself.\"\n\nI just don't really see the point of this sub? Seems more like it's a trap for people that are pro AI. They'll come here thinking they can discuss AI but all they get is people insulting them and telling them they're trash, garbage human beings and should be ashamed.\n\nUpdate: Yeah so the \"pro-ai\" subs don't want me either. I'm pretty far left, and the pro-ai subs all seem to be pretty far right, so they are not very... appreciative of my posts.",

Of course the opinions would be divided. \n\nThere are alot of people who like AI and who like open source especially but then aren't okay with private corporations vacuuming up all creative works while taking in billions of VC capital with a total disregard for the artists that formed their bedrock.\n\nThat and unfortunately for every one person like yourself who is just having fun with personal projects there is some guy spinning up dozens of AI content farms mass producing low quality slop-content for profit because their playing a numbers game and trying to game algorithms. It tends to give the entire space a bad look. \n\nI like AI. I train them and I find it neat AF what I can do with them. But id be lying if it isn't discouraging seeing how people min-max it for profit and downstream ruin large chunks of the internet.\n\nI'd suggest checking out some of the more focused subs if your discouraged. Stable diffusion for image generation, the machine learning sub for the technical discussions, there is also some chatgpt coding subs where people share projects they're working on through AI. It's not all bad and alot of them are more chill. \n\nThe local llama subreddit is especially good for LLM based discussions.",

I don't think the technology is inherently bad, that's for sure, there are definitely some neat things to do with models based off machine learning and it's simply been helpful for some things in my life.

Most are free for alls because nobody wants the thankless job of faffing about with post curation. Most people on these subs have come to complain and are seeking validation.  So, anti-whatever the subreddit is about posts are going to find more upvotes than positive posts.  This is extremely true for any technology related subreddit.\n\nIf you're looking for quality, you have to dig deeper into reddit to find those moderated ones and/or niche topics.  I haven't looked, but I bet you'll find a lot less anti-AI posts in /r/ollama, for example.",

We no longer trust those in power to do right by us, and that bleeds into every issue, including AI.\n\nI think reflexive anti-AI sentiment is a concern because it hampers thoughtful discourse but also because it'll impede the diffusion of a genuinely useful technology, which is a net loss for progress as well as competitiveness. It's notable that Americans are some of the most distrustful of AI in the world, whereas Chinese people are much more favorably disposed. In China, the public still largely believes in the promise of technology and the legitimacy of their government. (See the [Edelman](https://www.edelman.com/trust/2025/trust-barometer/report-tech-sector) and [Pew](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2025/10/15/how-people-around-the-world-view-ai/) surveys of global attitudes towards AI.)\n\nFar be it from me to cheerlead the CCP, and I'm well aware of the numerous issues plaguing that country. But is it any wonder that Americans have such strong misgivings? Just look at the attitude of the powers that be in Silicon Valley and their contempt for regular people. Look at the kleptocracy that now runs DC. Look at our utter failure to regulate social media, or to take care of those left behind, or to address the yawning gap in wealth inequality.\n\nI want AI to work, but I want it to work for us. Until we can have confidence in that, the egg-throwing will continue.",

We've never seen a tech advance this rapidly before; it is not like the others.\n\nIts ubiquity means ultimately everyone who engages with any sort of digital tool or platform will encounter it and learn how to get around, out of necessity. \n\nBut antis have their reasons well beyond job losses or abstract technophobias: rampant digital fraud, decay of manual skills and the neurological mind-body connection, ever-decreasing attention spans, kids not building confidence through their own unplugged abilities, society becoming even more siloed and disconnected, rising rates of depression and mental health issues due to increasing isolation... \n\nThere are some quality applications for this tech--gen ai has saved my ass at work, helped solve some lingering quandaries, taught me how to do, build and repair things. But there are some valid real-world concerns around moderation, discernment, regulation and our own collective self-control. I don't think we've seen much of any of those, yet.",

          "text": "Your point is true on many subreddits, not just this one, with downvotes only exasperated by complete bans that are designed to silence critical thinking or real analysis. This subreddit has almost 350,000 weekly visitors, so expect that those who are interested may just read your post or even some comments, then move on without upvoting or commenting or providing an alternative viewpoint even. Most Redditors use the system to downvote stuff they disagree with instead of engaging in a conversation, or even reading the long explanations that are worth the time and help us grow. Keeping a positive outlook can be tough, and getting negative karma has consequences for any post or account, as you know. But I look at the last three years (since Jan 2023) that I've been using ChatGPT, Claude and now Gemini to maximize my output and improve my writing and now even do deep research that I then verify before using, and my mind is boggled at the growth in accuracy and usefulness. I pay for both Claude and ChatGPT and have since both platforms offered their monthly or annual option, and I think the next few years will become even more mind-blowing and useful. In the real world, not this upvoting world of Reddit, businesses and writers are using AI to streamline work, speed up projects, deepen analysis, and provide more over less time. I love to watch the \"thinking\" that AI does as it does research on the topic I requested, fyi. I wish I could see the process that goes on inside the mind of people who do the same work. Back in 2023, I got so much hate from people dissing AI or trying to break language models with terrible prompts, that I just stopped commenting on stuff on the many subreddits dedicated to AI and I refused to post anything to help them grow or learn. Growth should be the focus, but that's not what most people want. They want to hate, criticize, and appear to be informed and intelligent, even when they aren't, but that is America and even the global network of people who visit here weekly. It is who we are as a group. Don't let the haters ruin your day. Just know that there are people who read what you post and either agree or just enjoy your contributions, but they may not upvote or leave a comment. Reading the comments below makes me laugh at how so many people find a reason to downvote your post, and then others to upvote their \"witty\" comment. Most high-level entertainers never read the comments section of their social media because of haters, trolls, and bots, and that might be a good survival technique. I still read people's comments so I can understand the main arguments, even when they are imprecise, badly worded, no longer relevant, or annoying. I ignore most single-sentence responses.",

Good for finding where information lives, not for building outputs.\n\nNotes / Knowledge\nNotion AI - Good for organizing and revisiting information after the work is done.Not ideal for raw research or file-level outputs.\nCurious what others consider the best AI tools right now and how do you use AI in your workflow?",

Even using only modern text, we needed the commons to ever bulk up to these levels. Writers draw from it, the technical documents that are more commonly used are built from common knowledge. The very math at the core is, really not a trade secret. It's math, and they are hoping we won't notice.\n\n\nThe real edge they have is money, and therefore hardware.\n\n\nBut that last part is one hell of a doozy. Even the open source models weren't really trained very transparently, which is a deal breaker for a lot of hardcore OSS folks. I'm more of a pragmatist, from which I say we already have very capable open source models, with relatively clean origin stories, but they are also going to have real limitations and design challenges. Plus, it's unlikely anyone is going to give us billions of dollars to train new models that won't make money. So it's kind of like you take what you can get.",
