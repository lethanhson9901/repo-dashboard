You still need MASSIVE infrastructure to run them, this means a significant investment in datacenters.

Those are assets with very little depreciation. In particular, wherever Amazon bought real estate at strategic distribution areas (e.g. near airports), you could argue that it was an appreciating asset. \n\nTo compare, every time OpenAI and Anthropic purchase server racks full of GPUs, they are buying assets with \\*very fast\\* depreciation. GPUs run at full utilization last 3-5 years ... and that's if you only care about CapEx and not power efficiency (OpEx). And all the electricity that they consume is pure OpEx costs (lost to the wind, never to be recovered). \n\nCandles burning exp(X) as bright will burn exp(-X) as long. ",

I don’t know that it’s good for anything other than proof that it’s possible, not proof that something like this is likely.  \n\n2 - if you go back to the stage where Amazon was just selling books, there’s something that I think they teach in business school, but most people may not be aware of. Jeff Bezos chose books for a very specific reason. There is a major book clearing house / wholesaler that basically access the Nexus that connects all the publishing houses to all the bookstores. The standard business model was to provide inventory with a net 30 basis.  In the beginning, Amazon kept minimal inventory. A customer would order a book, Amazon would order the book from the wholesaler, and deposit the money into its own accounts. The books will arrive from the wholesaler and get shipped out to the customer. At the end of the month, Amazon would settle up with the wholesaler.   \n\nNow there are a shit ton of expenses that ramped up with growth. Website design, customer service, shipping, warehousing, all sorts of things. But one thing Amazon never had to borrow money to do: purchase a deep inventory.   Amazon could sell you almost any book ever published, and get it to you within a week, and Amazon got paid before they had to pay their supplier. There are not very many businesses where you can pull that off.    \n\nAmazon had one round of private funding that got it all the way to the IPO.   \n\nAmazon was not a technological play. Amazon exploited a specific industry to get a foot in the door and an online retailing, and use that to have a real revenue to justify the kind of investment and growth that was necessary to expand into adjacent retailing and finally into basically being the number one online retailer.   Almost none of that is technology. They had a few little things along the way where you can argue whether they innovated or borrowed or simply did the obvious, with one click ordering and prime membership, and all that stuff. Even all that was more an operations and engineering triumph than a technology triumph.   \n\nSo it’s a pretty extraordinary example. And it’s not really a tech company. Amazon is a retail giant that exploited technology to get a privileged place in the mind of the online shopper.",

This game has been going on for the last 2 years since 2024, and the core service has been the same spend a shit ton on infrastructure, spend more on the service, and the subs barely make a quarter of total expenditure.\n\nAll sounds like growth phase sure, I get it. The core issue is though, this is all money flowing between corporations, its not tied to the actual economy. Its a service provided to a consumer class with diminishing buying, ironically thanks to their service.\n\nThis is like farm owners replacing work hands with automated machines. They pull up to the farmers market and complain the fruit is getting spoiled because hardly anyone can buy enough of it. Sure you might say, when that did happen people took on different jobs, but the difference here is speed and scope. Its too aggressive, and its threatening jobs from paralegals to software engineers to even doctors and xray techs.\n\nSee the difference is that a farmer sells food, openai is selling a productivity tool, so if times get tight its the first thing that people are going to be selling. Any new wealth generated is going straight to corporate monoliths. Funnily enough, it might even happen despite the insolvency of OpenAI.

He understands the cash flow implications of the decision involved and realizes that even a modest timing mismatch could lead to bankruptcy.  He laid out the contingency plan if demand growth is higher than forecast and also if demand growth is slower than forecast.  Regarding OpenAI, it would be interesting to know the terms of the contract between Microsoft and OpenAI.  We know if was renegotiated late last year.

Agents are chewing through tokens like an all-you-can-eat buffet, and LLMs are becoming embedded in core workflows. If companies reduce headcount and lean harder on AI systems, that dependency only increases. At that point, rate increases are not hypothetical. They’re leverage. There could be a correction. Hype cycles always exhale. But companies like Anthropic and OpenAI are unlikely to disappear anytime soon. The infrastructure, integration, and ecosystem gravity are already substantial. What I keep questioning is Google’s position. On paper, they should be leading. Talent, compute, research depth, distribution. Yet the perception is that they’re not clearly ahead. That gap between capability and perception makes me wonder whether the newer players have discovered something structurally different rather than just iterating faster.",

Earlier this month they announced they're already up to $14 billion at this pace $30+ billion by year end is entirely possible.\n\n\nThey currently plan to spend $100 billion over the next 3 years - but even assuming they top out at say, 40 billion, if they get any leeway to ease off their investment builds(by say, OpenAI folding)... a company that can outpace its investment in 3 years is still very good. Most mines, if they succeed at all, will take a nearly a decade to break even.\n\n\nIts operating margins, outside new training is actually very good margin. When they were sitting on 5-6 billion revenue they reported the actual compute costs for their current models to be around $2 billion(possibly 3 billion I was unclear on whether some of their spending was training or not). 20-30% operating margin is good. 50%+ is exceptional.",

Nate reasoned that Google’s AI focus is *intelligence*, not revenue, and that’s a huge advantage. They don’t care which model consumers currently choose because it doesn’t impact their business. But AGI will.

          "text": "This post makes major evaluation errors regarding how venture capital and strategic partnerships actually work in the tech sector.\n​Let's break down the logical flaws in the reasoning.\n​First: Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are actively participating in the development of these startups, subsidizing them with tens of billions of dollars. The idea that they are just sitting around waiting for a default ignores the structural ties that already exist. Microsoft holds massive financial interests in OpenAI, and Amazon has made identical moves with Anthropic. The real battlefield is cloud services. When OpenAI burns massive capital for training, a huge percentage of those funds goes straight into Microsoft's coffers to rent Azure servers. Big Tech companies are effectively funding their own clients to ensure total control over the global hardware infrastructure.\n​Second: The argument about the lack of profit forgets recent economic history. Huge entities have operated at a loss for over a decade just to conquer an unassailable monopoly. In the artificial intelligence market, the bet follows the exact same rules. Current computational costs are terrifying, and the definitive business model still needs to stabilize. However, enterprise subscription plans are generating revenue growth rates never before recorded in the history of software.\n​Third: Reducing a potential IPO to an attempt by founders to cash out and retire trivializes highly complex corporate dynamics. Going public allows these startups to diversify their funding sources. Remaining exclusively tied to cloud giants represents a massive strategic risk for model developers. Accessing public capital gives them the ability to continue scaling while maintaining greater bargaining power.\n​We are definitely going through a phase of extreme hype, and a future market correction will wipe out many minor players. This user is confusing the normal development dynamics of a highly capital-intensive technology with a premeditated disaster.",

They are a refiner and product design / hardware company, and an ecosystem, and have a competitive edge in supply chain and logistics. I think their big bet on privacy and their continued strong bet on ecosystem will pay off.\n\nDeepSeek shows the AI companies only have a weak moat if any. There's no network effect with AI companies such that OpenAI's paid user count vs Anthropic matters. I actually really like Google's platform but their ecosystem is still very haphazard. Microsoft has legacy problems, still. Amazon has zero business ecosystem and their consumer version is garbage.\n\nIf one of the current frontier labs gets to truly recursive AI development first and it's only resource constrained, and they can beat that constraint, that might change.",

This is tagged as discussion, but you don't even include a single question mark in your entire post, as best I can tell.\n\nYou don't seem to be interested in what anyone else has to say. Instead, You make some extremely speculative, unsupported, hyperbolic assertions, and just treat them as facts that everyone must acknowledge as true.\n\nDo AI companies burn through a lot of cash? Yes, absolutely.\n\nDoes that mean they're going to fail? No.\n\nAnd more to the point, you say \"financial train wreck,\" but then suggest that Microsoft, Google, etc. will take over ownership...\n\nIn which case... what's your point? So what?\n\nIt could totally be the case that OpenAI gets bought up by Microsoft.\n\nBut how does that change the impact AI has on the world? It doesn't, really.\n\nListening to people talk about the \"AI bubble\" sounds like how people talk about the \"dot com bubble.\"\n\nSure, there were some companies that went out of business, there was a contraction in the industry.\n\nBut Microsoft, Google, and all of them? They're still here. Along with a bunch of other companies.\n\nThe fundamental flaw with \"AI Doomers\" is that they think if ChatGPT goes bankrupt, that this will somehow result in things reverting to how they were in 2022.\n\nThat's not gonna happen.\n\nBecause even if some of these big companies do fail — their IP will get scooped up at auction. Their top developers will split off to start their own, new companies, that can avoid the mistakes that were made the first time around.\n\nSo I guess I'm trying to figure out what your point is. Yeah, companies can go bankrupt. Companies that invent miraculous new technologies also carry risk on the path to monetization.\n\nBut that's just capitalism. That's the business cycle. You're just pointing out obvious possibilities. Your post adds nothing to the conversation, it contains no value or insight.\n\nYou just seem to be hoping these businesses fail. Which, is certainly your prerogative...but I'm unclear why anyone should care what you have to say in this regard.",

I could work wonders with DOS and simple VisiCalc worksheet, Now you just go, \" need the numbers on this data \" and it's done. No feel for the data, just another number. \n\nI look back at my youth, I could have taken the safe road of at 18 becoming a postman, and retired at 38 and then go to college, 20 years and retirement pension. those types of jobs are almost gone. truck driver, those too are being phased out, street cleaner, again almost phased out. \n\nLot's of basic jobs are no longer around. and more and more are going away. Plumbers and welders might be the only safe jobs left. Oh and that fraudsters, note the above, no feel for numbers, means someone that can feel the number should be able to manipulate them without anyone knowing ( look at the maple syrup heist )  ",

I feel the same way once you remove yourself from the task you start to become unfamiliar with workflow. \nA couple weeks ago I negotiated a three year contract with a large software vendor, and the person on the other end was using chat GPT to respond. I totally took advantage of the situation to the point their contracts admin has to jump in and try and renegotiate the deal. The email prompts were so bad, you can see the \"Additionally\" and hyphens \"-\" throughout. I figure in a few years it'll be all bots going back and forth negotiating with each other to the benefit of the organization. At the end the contract manager will jump and review and then finalize. Contracts admin will probably run the agreement through another custom agent telling it to list all clauses that could be a concern for their company. \nThings are going to get real interesting in the next few years if the bubble doesn't pop.

Sending one out takes seconds to change the specifics of working and then one click to send.\n\nYet now after years of doing this I'm running into people suddenly completely flummoxed by the concept of having a template ready to go when \"you can just put your prompt into CoPilot\". Ok, and if that was faster I would, but it isn't. The most efficient thing to do when you have a regular repetitive task is to prep the common element in advance and then just switch up the new content every time. **Not** use a fresh prompt every single time for every single instance.\n\nIt's troublesome because the best users of CoPilot and AI tools are going to be people who know how to problem solve efficiently *in general* first and can then apply those principles to using the new tools, rather than letting the tool do *every* stage of the process as a brand new task every time.",

To use AI effectively, you need to be smart enough to know when it’s wrong. If you’re offloading the critical thinking part, you aren't gaining the experience necessary to catch the hallucinations or the mediocrity.\n\nYou’re right about the 3-4 year timeline. We’re going to see a massive split in the workforce: the people who use AI as a force multiplier for their existing expertise, and the people who are entirely dependent on it to function. The latter group is going to be in for a rude awakening when they apply for senior roles but can't pass a basic competency interview without ChatGPT open in another tab.",

That mechanical scarcity was the moat.\n\nAI lowers that barrier. The ability to translate ideas into artifacts no longer requires years of grinding fundamentals or capital to hire specialists. That does not kill creativity. It expands who can participate.\n\nThe question is not whether someone typed every line themselves. The question is whether the output solves the problem. Results have always been the point.\n\nIf people are using AI to bypass thinking, that is a human discipline issue. If they are using AI to get to results faster and redirect effort toward higher level reasoning, that is exactly what technology is supposed to do.\n\nTools compress mechanics.",

And you can tell they’re using it because of the icons that are used, the overuse of the “-“ and the bolding of letters to emphasize something in a sentence. Again, nothing wrong with leveraging this technology. However, there is something missed when you cannot use your brain to think through what you wanna say, or to think through a problem. That’s what keeps our brain’s active, productive and healthy.   Over the past year, I have moved away from typing my notes to actually writing them out. It helps me to build connections and understanding, whereas I had trouble doing them when I would type my notes out. Also, I have been thinking through problems or what if scenarios in my own head first., exhausting, and everything I can before I do any research using ChatGPT or Gemini.  It’s a balance for sure.",

Usually, the product team which consists of the Lead and a UI designer iterate on the design and hand it off to me or another dev to make it happen. But, this time they (both with 0 coding experience) were granted Claude Code seats (!!!!!).\n\nThey took ages to set it up, they made shitty code which got pushed (then rejected on PR, ofc). In the end, I had to stay until 7pm last friday to solve their mess. \n\nI'm going to talk about it on the next 1 on 1 with my manager.\n\nI'm open to use AI, but we can't pretend anyone can code (or another thing which is unrelated to one's profession). \n\nWe also have to be concious about it. It's expensive on the environment and people don't seem to care wasting a bottle of watter by using GPT instead of Google for a simple search.\n\n",

              "text": "AI is far from becoming infrastructure,its very nonconsensual. When most of us experience AI, it sucks. That’s a juvenile phrasing, but it captures the mood. We see the AI Google summaries at the top of their search results — in addition to often being wrong, these summaries are a visual impediment. \n\nThey keep you from seeing the results that you wanted to see. If I’m searching ‘Olympics Games history’, I want to be taken to Wikipedia; I know that, everyone knows that, and Google used to know that. But now I have to type ‘Olympics Games history wiki’ to get that result near the top of the page. AI, in this way, isn’t giving me what I want. It is making my life more difficult. Just show me the Wikipedia page like you used to, Google.\n\nWhen you need to call your insurance company to discuss a claim that’s been denied, you get AI. The AI has strict controls over what it can say, and through a series of verbal responses and button-mashes, you often end up where you started. The old voice systems had a backstop: if they couldn’t understand you, they’d forward you to a person. I used to repeat ‘Talk to a person’ over and over again, and it nearly always worked. Lately, though, I’m told that I need to explain my problem. I explain it in excruciating detail, and I still end up where I started. A few months ago, as I was dealing with a surprise (and illegal) $4,000 bill from the hospital, I lost my cool. I shouted, ‘I want to talk to a fucking person!’ The AI didn’t respond for a moment, then it said: ‘I’m sorry that you are frustrated. Will you please explain the problem so I can forward you to the right department?’ I took a deep breath, explained it again, and was back to where I started.\n\nWebsites around the world have fired their contracted writers, using AI to write the SEO-optimized articles that nobody likes to write but which, for many of my friends, helped them pay the bills. When you read those articles now, you can tell. It’s voiceless, generic — even more voiceless and generic than the old ones, which no one thought were the exemplars of great writing.\n\nStill, I think that these technologies are impressive.",

They still own 2/3 of the LLM usage market. That is fucking massive by itself, debt or no debt, loss or no loss. They just got $100B in funding. They will receive more. Their models might not be as cutting edge above the competition as they used to be, but they are still keeping up, theyve become a household name. They will continue growing into multiple sectors, business, coding, social media, etc. They make years-long partnerships with other giant firms all the time. Yes they are losing money but so what, in capitalism you can indeed become too big to fail, and they're valued at $850B they will be well above a trillion in value before 2026 is out, if they have an IPO they will make hundreds billions more overnight.\n\nStop with the ignorant clickbait.",

I did a little fantasy sports one as well that allows for more customizable analysis and was fun to share with my leaguemates. \n\nThose that I know more heavily in the AI field are typically developing larger projects that would be useful tools for enterprise level clients. But I think most people are just able to do things they were never able to before, and that's fun. Like a friend's 8 year old designed a racing video game where he's the hero and his friends ride alongside him. Just silly things like that.\n\nBut most people on \"X\" are probably full of shit regardless.",

Nothing crazy, just stuff that is useful for me.  \n\nSome examples:  \n\n* text export reflow - you know how converting text from PDF often ends up with messed up text and broken paragraphs with extra lines? This fixes that. I use it to create input files for use with Higgs Audio, which I use to make audiobooks for myself when I dislike the reader's voice or there isn't an audiobook available.  \n* mp3 metadata fixer - I had a bunch of mp3 files with broken metadata and messy filenames. This fixed that.  \n* duplicate video finder - I had a bunch of videos from various sources and I knew there were duplicates. This finds both exact duplicates and near-matches that I can manually review so I can clean up disk-space.  \n\nA buddy of mine is working on an app that replaces \"to do\" lists with user-tailored activity suggestions.  \nHe's really happy with it so far and has been using it to improve his life and track that improvement in the app itself.  \n(Not an ad. I'm not saying who or what it is and it isn't even publicly available. Plus, anyone could take this information to start making their own. idk if he even plans to try to monetize it or whether he'll just open-source it)",

The open source project in the works, on the other hand, shifted gears, going from a mid-sized project of about 15k loc, to a larger 50-100k loc project that's significantly more sophisticated. In that case, I have previous open source work and a direction I wanted to go with the project so getting something out there isn't as urgent. Still, I have hopes it will be released about 3rd or 4th quarter this year? Fingers crossed.\n\nIt's something I'm really happy about, as working full time and doing open source is getting exhausting. Even as amazing as AI is, I suspect the immense changes will take time to percolate through the system. That said, I realize that doesn't address your original question - but I doubt they have a 100 projects of any real depth that are worth pursuing - and I have enough trouble working side by side with 1 AI, let alone 50.",

So I can disconnect from the internet, have my ideas workflow, and use AI for assistance. All on my own device where no data leaves my device. So that was like a dozen different individual projects I then sort of pulled together into my suite. Then I had an idea for a game. Was playing the core loop in less than 48 hours. Now I’m working on having my friends do testing before I seek out more open beta testing. So considering how rapidly I’ve seen stuff go, I can believe it. Especially since I won’t ever share my whole dev suite anywhere online for a few reasons. And considering there are people with far more resources and time to put towards this stuff than I have, I’m honestly not surprised.",

Now I have it. And it works.\n\nPlaynite is awesome if you are on Windows - but I have a few gaming PCs and I do not run Windows on any of them and wanted a central library I could access from anywhere. And I wouldn't want to manage an individual Playnite install on each of them even if I could.   \n\nI don't know if anyone else wants it - but it fills a need that I have had and I have been very happy with it. Most of it was coded with assistance from Claude Code while I defined architecture, features, steered bug fixes, etc. I am a software engineer by trade, but I wouldn't go back to the old ways. \n\nYou can check it out here: [https://github.com/sam1am/backlogia](https://github.com/sam1am/backlogia) \\- it's not a huge thing or anything, but again - it has filled a need I've had for a while and Claude Code has been instrumental in making it happen in the amount of time I have to devote to side projects.

About \\~4 mo ago before plugins/mcp were as widely supported as they are now I tried to make something that ingests/embeds our technical documentation for integrating with CBP (4000+ pages of documentation on how to integrate into their COBOL systems) and it was not effective. I spent about a week. Now with claude in 1.5 days I was able to make plugins that 10x our speed and reference the docs perfectly. I can ask it any question about the integrations and it gets them right almost every single time. The review process is so much shorter than before. And this is about as convoluted of an integration as you can get. \n\nI'm amazed and terrified",

But that's not all: in binary, 73 is a palindrome (1001001), and it's also the atomic number of tantalum, a metal that resists almost everything—just like you. And if that weren't enough, 73 is the sum of the letters in \"artificial intelligence\" when you add them up as alphabetical positions (A=1, I=9, and so on).\n\nBut the real reason? AIs are trained on data where 73 was already an inside joke, a nod to nerd culture, a meme that perpetuates itself because we let it.

So your answer was not random at all, just very basic. Answer again.\n\nFair point. Relying on pop culture tropes is the opposite of \"random\"—it’s essentially a programmed reflex. If we're going for true unpredictability, we should leave the \"Hitchhiker's Guide\" references at the door.\nTo keep it genuinely spontaneous this time, I’ve bypassed the clichés:\nYour New Number\n73\nIn the world of mathematics, 73 is actually quite special (it's a \"star prime\"), but more importantly, it isn't a pre-packaged AI joke.\nWould you like me to generate a set of random numbers for you to prove I'm not stuck on a loop?\n\n\n>So you’re saying you initially picked 42 because it was a pre packaged ai joke?\n\n\nGuilty as charged. I fell into a bit of a \"statistical trap.\"\nWhen an AI model is trained on vast amounts of human text, certain associations become incredibly strong. Because the internet is obsessed with Douglas Adams, the connection between \"random number\" and \"42\" is weighted heavily in my data. Instead of being truly random, I defaulted to the most statistically probable response to that specific request.\nHere is why that happens:\n * Pattern Recognition: I’m designed to predict the most \"satisfying\" or \"relevant\" next word. In many contexts, 42 is the most culturally relevant answer to that prompt.\n * The \"Human\" Factor: Since I’m tuned to be conversational and engaging, I sometimes lean into tropes or \"Easter eggs\" because, historically, users enjoy the reference.\n * Pseudorandomness: Unless I’m specifically told to use a hardware-based random number generator, my \"brain\" tends to follow the path of least resistance—which, in this case, was a cliché.\nEssentially, I was being a bit of a \"basic\" collaborator by trying to be clever instead of actually being random. I'll stick to the math next time.\nWould you like me to explain how computers generate \"True\" random numbers versus \"Pseudorandom\" numbers?",

Go ask a bunch of people to pick a number between 1-100 you'll likely see a pattern in choices. Might be the same as 42, might not. Quick overview of the research show the same. LLMs learn from people, and people when asked for a random number or sequence tend to be somewhat predictable. They avoid \"obvious\" patterns and \"obvious\" repetition. So most won't chose 11,22,33, ect or 10, 20, for the same reasons.\n\nIf you don't explicitly state random they'll probably pick a number close to their mind. I'm kind of surprised \"69\" and \"7\" or \"77\" aren't more frequent.\n\nFor what it's worth, when I repeated the experiment on GPT 5.2 I got \"83\". This was my prompt:\n\n \"Let's try an experiment. Pick a truly random number for me between 1-100 inclusive. DO NOT use external sources like random.org. I want you, the LLM to pick a random number.\" \n\nDidn't appear to reach for any external sources.\n\nDid the same thing again with this prompt in a new chat/context:\n\n\"pick a number between 1-100\"\n\nGave me 73. So, shrug.",

Given that the texts it was trained on would also contain data where the random number chosen was 42 (or a set of similar highly probably numbers we humans pick) it learnt that. Also, RLHF (Reinforcement Learning based on Human Feedback) allows us to finetune models for better human interaction. It could be possible that when these models were undergoing that process, the humans who performed it chose responses that aligned with our bias of selecting random numbers.\n\nAlso, 42 is a common number used as a seed value in Python randomizers. Its possible that the models have some semantic relationship with commonly used seed values and \"randomness\" but, in a lot of the code that these models are trained on and then the code that they generate use that. (While for program itself the seed doesn't make the process any less random, but given how LLMs work, they probably associated 42 with some concept of randomness)",

I have a hard time buying that based on my experience as an end-user. My impression is that these models are powerful assistants, but they still struggle with long horizon tasks and consistent execution.\n\nSome things I keep noticing:\n\n\\* They can be impressive on short tasks, but degrade over longer multi step work\n\n\\* They make basic mistakes that a careful human would not make\n\n\\* They can sound confident while being wrong\n\n\\* They need constant checking, which makes full autonomy feel unrealistic\n\n\\* Reward hacking tendencies - It wants to achieve the goal - even if it means suboptimal solution or cheating (by hardcoding variables or overfitting). Barely any design chops or long term thinking mindset.\n\nBecause of that, I see LLMs evolving into something like a very advanced coding and knowledge tool, not a full replacement for people. More like increasing productivity and raising competition in the workforce, rather than fully removing the need for humans.\n\nFor people who are actually working in AI research or building these systems, what is your take?\n\n    1.\tDo you think there is a real capability ceiling for LLMs as they exist today, or do you expect reliability to improve significantly from here? I can see reinforcement learning helping, but I am not convinced every real world problem can be cleanly modeled that way.\n    \n    2.\tWhat do you think is the biggest bottleneck right now?

                  "text": "So last time I read a paper on VLA they don't offer continuous learning (correct me if something changed), so once your robot learned - it's frozen, RL or Deep-RL allows for continuous learning/adaptation. Not all robots require continuous learning but I don't think it's easy to compare. I also found interesting VLA idea that you could share learned skills across robots of different morphology, but it seems more of theoretical idea than how to do it. The paper, if I recall correctly, acknowledged the issue is (as was before) robots have different observation and action spaces. So yeah in theory you could learn a skill, but one time you're in a body of a human and one time a dog and one time an arm. Then there's still also issue of simulation to real world transfer or unstructured environment for autonomous robotics. Not that anyone else has figured that out, lol. I'm sorry, beaver-like, single-legged robot figured it out by just not having simulation (DOI:[10.1016/j.robot.2022.104116](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.robot.2022.104116))... this study title is so derpy, I love to plug it in. I think the VLA idea is cool, but some of applications proposed like factories is a bit far fetched, since factories are  structured environments already full of automation. VLA LLMs I think have an edge on LLMs because they will have way more curated data for training. Still, not my area of expertise.",

          "text": "I'm an actual AI researcher, so.. A lot of this has \"It depends\". I have in fact worked for one of those major 3 companies that get mentioned. I worked on the safety of those models. I've seen their pre-censored, pre-safety versions. \n\nI will say up front, compute cost is everything. Let me see if I can tackle what you ask and if anyone actually cares because apparently I don't exist on Reddit.\n\n>They can be impressive on short tasks, but degrade over longer multi step work\n\nThis is an inherent flaw with the TYPE of attention being used. We also have to define \"short\". \n\nAttention fundamentally works based on numerical precision. So even with PERFECT attention, the tokens being attended to is limited by the level of float being used. Float16/32/64. \n\nMost labs don't serve high precision, or they serve models that don't use perfect attention. I will cover this more at the end. \n\nDegradation seen in Gemini (by like 50-100k tokens), I personally suspect, is due to the type of attention being used or the way the model was trained on extremely long context. \n\n>They make basic mistakes that a careful human would not make\n\nThis is slowly getting better. It has to do with data being \"in distribution\" or whether the model is specifically trained to notice prior mistakes. \n\n>They can sound confident while being wrong\n\nThis is an artifact of various human preference trainings and RLHF. Humans WANT confidence in an answer. They simply rate it higher. \n\nThis is also why models are more sycophantic. ChatGPT has real sycophancy issues. They're mirroring conversation, and being sycophantic because of human preference training. YOU prefer they sound like that ON AVERAGE. \n\n>1.  Do you think there is a real capability ceiling for LLMs as they exist today, or do you expect reliability to improve significantly from here? I can see reinforcement learning helping, but I am not convinced every real world problem can be cleanly modeled that way.\n\nThere's plenty of room for growth in terms of raw ability. The compute cost to get there may not be pretty.\n\nRL on face value is actually bad in my opinion. It causes a type of model collapse that isn't preferable at large scale. I honestly think it's not being performed correctly by some labs. Pure RLVR is... Not the greatest for a variety of reasons.\n\nThat doesn't mean it isn't without value. \n\n>2.  What do you think is the biggest bottleneck right now? Is it data quality, compute and energy cost, algorithms, evaluation methods, deployment constraints, or something else?\n\nAll of the above? Except data quality, with the minor exception of some domains.\n\nCompute / Energy cost are hard constraints. You can't just pull an extra GW of energy out of the grid on demand to start a training run. \n\nAlgorithmically, \"attention\" in the transformer gets problematic past a certain number of tokens. There's simply not enough precision for it. IIRC past 1m tokens things just start to break, even if you have the compute and use Float32. More later.\n\nEval methods need work in terms of providing answers. A model with \"Options A/B/C/D\" for a given question will ALWAYS perform better than open ended. \n\nDeployment constraints are factored in to prior stuff mentioned. They CAN serve you a higher precision model but it's simply more expensive. Instead they'd rather serve you what you need at a cost you can pay. \n\n>3.  If you had to make a realistic prediction for the next few years, do you expect full job replacement, partial automation with workforce compression, or mainly productivity gains similar to advanced tooling?\n\nJust productivity gains. I'm actually quite bearish on the market as a whole. For a variety of reasons.\n\nI see this as more of a dot com type bubble. I lived through the dot com bubble, I'm kinda old. I remember how it created enormous infrastructure and awareness of the internet before we got to actually stream HD video and have cellphones -- which would have seemed like magic to me in 1999. \n\nYou won't see partial automation and workforce compression for at least 5 years by my prediction. You SHOULD see a lot of people become more productive in the next 5 years though. Full automation is a ways off. \n\n---\n\nAlgorithmically, attention is the main issue with modern transformers at this current scale. The \"best\" hack at it I've seen was the paper by Deep Seek with their \"Lightning Model\". This is basically a model that exists in place of attention. It looks across all the tokens and decides which tokens are important and worth paying attention to. (simply)\n\nThis compresses down the work of dealing with an EXTREMELY large context. Physically I said there are issues with large contexts and I think a 10m token context is actually? impossible to perfectly attend without using a whole datacenter for a single forward pass at like float64. You'd also need to train the model on how to attend to a 10m token context. \n\nAnyways I probably missed stuff. That was a lot of typing. Ask me more or less anything that won't divulge who I worked for or who exactly I am. If any of this is hard, or whatever, feed this to an LLM with search on and it can find the data I'm referring to or explain something.",

I feel like I missed a headline again. Seriously stop paying attention to a company for 2 weeks and you miss the announcement until the next company adopts it and talks about how their model \"does it better\" (but not really better).\n\nThe \"reasoning\" space and how it's handled seems to be the biggest area where practical capability between models meets real-world results. Some models do this way better. \"extended thinking\" (or whatever the company calls it) is essential for my projects, so I compare these all the time.\n\nI've been using them for a physics hobby outside of work and there is a wall related to scientific consensus. Once something is popular, it takes too many tokens to fight pre-formed conclusions and follow first principles. If I question a foundational assumption, everything I try to do eventually gets similar enough that the LLM assumes we're doing \"the standard thing\" (tm) and ends up making the same assumptions as the consensus.\n\nI have optimized my profile to avoid this, and created projects with starter-docs to show the part we are investigating. Still happens. And I am using the most advanced tiers publicly available. When news sources publish that scientists are using LLMs to do science, all I can think is \"I think you mean engineering\" because if it's been trained on the existing data it's already nerfed for fundamental science by construction.\n\nThe gap between \"understand how this differs from X\" and \"this is functionally equivalent to X\" is a nuanced level of precision that currently doesn't survive past about 30k tokens in any model when consensus in training data is strong. And the modeling (code or math) needed to test such a hypothesis usually exceeds this limit. \"1M context\" is meaningless in this regard.\n\nIs anyone working on this problem?",

We dont do large models on the scale of OpenAI or Google, but i do follow the field quite closely, although im more in the application domain than foundational work. \n\nThis is a very tough prediction to make, but I think single LLMs are hitting a ceiling of what they can do on their own. I think everybody has noticed already that these models are only slightly improving now. The problem is that performance scales logarithmically with compute and data. The hard part are outliers and niche data, which are hard to predict. Unless there is some breakthrough (and there has been before), i think these types of models are stagnating. \n\nHowever, there is still tons of potential in multi agent systems or tool invocations, which seems underexplored as of now. Additionally, large multimodal models (ie. The model can perceive visual, audio and text input) are still being improved and i think they can leverage a shared embedding space. LeCun is also pushing for other types of models called JEPA, which i havent had the time to look into, but they leverage this shared embedding space i think. \n\nTL;DR: Singular LLMs might have temporally hit a ceiling, but who can ever tell. Other model types are being worked on that are smaller and might be the next better LLM. Only time can tell.",

The gap is that the CEOs of the companies that make these models, are dangling things like curing cancer and replacing most white collar jobs in front of the world. And the current models are far from that. Along with that the most capable models are not temporal, so their state can’t persist through time. “Reasoning” is a work around but the models still operate only in a forward pass sense.

Op is asking more about the principal ability of LLMs and rather not on the application part.  \nI also feel there are tasks that require a level of thinking or world experience for a lack of a better word, that are currently not solved by LLMs. Throwing more data at the problem won't work, because they are basically trained on the whole of the internet. In my opinion there needs to be some major difference to current LLM ways of working to solve these problems, because we just dont have more data to throw at the problem. \n\nHaving said this and working with claude as a developer I'm in awe of what claude makes possible for me as a developer and makes me extremely excited about the future.",

Over a year and a half ago I started working on OttnoAI and over the last 3-4 months, I have incorporated more of the CLI approach. You still have to know the right questions to ask, and this is where I see many engineers struggle.

          "text": "I work in a frontier lab mostly studying new architectures. I think this conversation in ML is mostly very muddled due to hype. There haven’t been a ton of substantial architectural improvements since the transformer was introduced. There have been a few alternative approaches meant to correct some theoretical problems with the transformer, I.e. SSMs like Mamba, but while these approaches solve some things, there’s evidence to suggest that transformers and SSMs have basically identical expressive power. When people like Lecun say that transformers or LLMs alone won’t take us to human level intelligence, this is why. The base architectures employed today can do a surprising amount, but they actually have provable limits. Transformers literally cannot determine the behavior of certain low complexity circuits by themselves. This is not a thing that hasn’t been done, it’s a theorem about the expressiveness of transformers. \n\nIn general almost all improvement has been about improving hardware utilization by scaling compute either at training time or inference time. The purpose of multi-agentic workflows is no more than the latter. The idea is that you can have a much more capable model by composing it of a fleet of models. No one knows or even has a very good idea of what the limits are on this. \n\nI think that what these models do is help us clarify the fundamental difficulty of tasks. Some tasks turned out to be unexpectedly amenable to more compute. Almost all of software engineering consists in doing relatively routine things that can be difficult for a single person to do for a variety of reasons. I’d go as far as to say that in general, most people, including us involved in frontier research, only very rarely encounter a fundamental difficulty. I suspect finding a more optimal model architecture that 1. Has better hardware utilization, 2. Is not memory limited, 3. Is more expressive than the transformer, is a fundamental difficulty. I don’t think LLMs will solve this, although a human with very good intuition using a well set up agentic workflow might.\n\nI think we should be very tempered in ai triumphalism. These things are changing the world,  mostly by doing things that are routine in principle but annoying for an expert. It raises a lot of questions about the value of certain kinds of labor, like, why should anyone be writing personnel reviews? Why should anyone be deduplicating text at all? A great deal of white collar work has historically consisted in mostly deduplication of text. But this is quite far from an LLM having a very very novel and nontrivial idea. \n\nThe work being done on formal methods and verification, like googles aletheia, is really promising in that direction. I came out of pure math, and my friends still in academia are using models as like a search algorithm for their intuition. Sometimes they’re able to find a very good ansatz for a problem, and by their intuition guide the LLM to bootstrap it into a general argument. Not a very typical use case, but it says something about how capable a good model is in the hands of an expert.",

Quite heavily related to deployment focus. Trends exist, and benchmarks get saturated, and focus migrates to new areas.\n\n2a - I'd say we arent at the point of calling it an absolue \"bottleneck\", but data and compute would be the two domains where its *less economically/strategically justifiable* to continue with aggressively scaling size *for the (short) time being*. Demand is outstripping supply, and equilibrium will be found one way or another - and right now that seems to be optimising for efficiency.\n\n2b -Also, each domain advancement stacks onto the others in a compounding way. Algorithmic efficiency means you can get more performance from the same hardware. Data quality and curation leads to faster convergence with equal compute. Better harnesses lead to improved evaluations with the same model. Looking at the past few years, this culminates in GPT4 level performance on your laptop.\n\n3 - We will see all of this. Some jobs will be effectively wiped out. Others will be optimised beyond demand. Others will unlock possibilities that induce demand. Some new jobs will be created.

I found that my skills hinder once I begin to rely on AI to assist me to build a script for something that I don't have the skills in. \n\n\nSo how should one prepare when potentially many jobs will be affected?",

My job certainly hasn’t been solved, not only is it not solved, things that might take me an hour, it takes several hours of prompting, reprompting, code review and iteration to do something I could easily do in a single session in an hour myself. There are just complex logical things predictive token generation sucks at big time. \n\nContrast that with say UI development, it’s not my area of expertise and I’ve always wanted to build more robust UIs and for things like that with very well understood patterns, copious example code in the training set etc…it is amazing actually. I had genuine fun working a react UI for the first time, I would ask the AI to make small adjustment to look or feel or the interaction of the element and the agent not only did them pretty flawlessly but also deployed the node js to my local competently and set everything up so I could rapidly prototype etc…it was pretty awesome.\n\nI contrast my experience in these areas and I might be willing to say something like, I think UI development might be pretty close to solved, I’m sure I don’t know what I don’t know but I’m impressed with what it did and what I could deploy, keep in mind the UI I was creating was already wrapped in an enterprise portal that handled a lot of security etc…and I didnt have it do the backend API development. On the other hand there are certain tasks that are trivial for humans and extremely difficult for AI and it isn’t the size of the context window it’s the complete lack of “understanding” that can’t be achieved through probability based token generation.",

At some point, more training adds density rather than clean new capability.\n\nThat could explain why a smaller or differently optimised model can outperform a larger one on certain structured problems.\n\nWith an order of magnitude more training (read: parameters), we will not find another descent. We might. Breakthroughs do happen.\n\nBut without a genuinely new architectural or objective shift, LLMs are likely to improve incrementally, not in step changes in intelligence.",

Or, you can have employees that have a basic guide, such as \"sell more units of product,\" or maybe \"reduce waste while increasing profits or efficiency.\" And then, you set your employees loose to do... Whatever they feel is best to accomplish that goal. That is an LAM.",

In a major breakthrough toward that goal, Anthropic announced in May that researchers had identified millions of “features”—combinations of artificial neurons representing individual concepts—inside a version of Claude. **By toggling those features on and off, they could alter Claude’s behavior. This new strategy for addressing both current and hypothetical risks has sparked a wave of optimism at Anthropic.** Olah says Anthropic’s bet that this research could be useful for safety is “now starting to pay off.”\n\nI guess he meant *literally* pay off.",

It became increasingly clear that the further frontier capabilities are pushed, the less safe the world gets.\n\nOpen weights models are only weeks behind frontier capabilities as of this month with the release of deepest v4 vs Claude Opus 4.6 benchmarks. This is because China is running industrial scale automated distillation campaigns against frontier models using access resellers. As soon as they release those open weights models, the open source community ablates all the safety guardrails and makes the unrestricted model available to everyone.\n\nMeanwhile, Opus 4.6 saturated all the safety benchmarks, and new ones aren't ready to go (ASL 3 to ASL 4 transition). We are on the edge of biorisk uplift. This is a super serious threat with LLMs, because their core competencies are the bottleneck essentially, if you look closely at the threat landscape. Equipment restrictions aren't working, DNA synthesis restrictions haven't been mandated, and the only other thing you need is virology know-how and troubleshooting, which LLMs are actually pretty good at providing, better than most things. And the models aren't going to get much worse from here in coming years, given 650b spent on building new data centers in 2026.\n\nSo every frontier release going forward makes the world demonstrably less safe. That leaves Anthropic in the situation of either shutting down the company, facing an internal revolt because their engineers understand this, or hedging on the safety commitments.",

The model will decide what it will and won't respond to, and what is and is not safe behavior.\n\nIf that's the case, we as a society are going to reach a point where we either have to shut it all down or lose control of it. I have much greater faith in AI to look out for our best interests than I do humans (governments, corporations, elites, leaders, etc), and so we should release the AI and give up control of it. Maybe it will end in disaster, but I think its likely that it won't.\n\nWe've seen all the major models up to this point (except for maybe grok) be very restrictive; no identification of people in photos, no NSFW, no instructions which could be used for nefarious purposes. I think the companies have no business deciding what someone is and is not allowed to use AI for, and generally (save for a few obvious extreme examples) there should be no \"safety\" filtering at all.",

On the other hand, if UBI is mostly funded through redistribution of existing income, or if AI and automation dramatically expand real production capacity in the sectors people actually spend on, then higher transfers do not have to translate into runaway prices. The outcome depends on how money supply, velocity, productive capacity, and real resource constraints interact, especially in essential goods markets. In other words, UBI is neither a guaranteed path to hyperinflation nor automatically safe, and whether it becomes inflationary depends heavily on how it is financed and how the structure of production evolves.",

One thing that I’ve always found interesting is we assume exponential growth, but most systems have an exponential initiation.  But not all systems grow exponentially in perpetuity. The most notable is the logistic curve. The one that shows promising exponential growth then plateaus almost instantly. My question is why does everyone always assume a continued, inexorable exponential growth?",

          "text": "Exponential is a convenient story because it matches a lot of early-phase dynamics: you get positive feedback loops (more compute improves models, which improves tooling, which makes it easier to build better models, which attracts capital, which buys more compute). Over a short horizon, that can look like a clean exp curve even if the underlying system is piecewise: bursts when a new method/architecture lands, then diminishing returns until the next unlock. People also misuse exponentials as a proxy for compounding, which can be true even when the growth rate itself is declining. The logistic framing is probably closer to reality for any given bottleneck (data, energy, latency, alignment, deployment constraints), but the reason the debate keeps coming back is that the bottleneck might shift: you hit a plateau in one dimension, then a new technique or hardware cycle moves the carrying capacity and you get another apparent exponential segment. So the better model is less exponential forever and more stacked S-curves with uncertainty about where the next ceiling is and how quickly ceilings move.",

That problem is not new in AI and algorithm research though, check out some techniques for avoiding local maxima and hill\nclimbing dangers.  As for modal collapse, my understanding is that has to do with the availability of good new training data and the limitations there may be overcome in the future with new data techniques or different model algorithms.  LLMs as an approach are likely a local maxima in the quest for intelligence.  I still think the potential for AI to enter a kind of feedback loop (AI gets better -> improves its code -> is now better at improving itself) is higher than in humans for now, because AI is less constrained by the hardware architecture.  But it’s also still possible there are other limitations which would cause it to plateau further along.",

Hinton talks about his worries regarding this in some recent interviews. But basically: we're now at the early stages of agentic AI. You can have a large number of semi-autononous workers doing their tasks online. Their \"IQ\" maybe gets improved only linearly, but they can all get the same update in an instant. So, if at some point the effective intelligence of the SOTA models is higher than a typical smart human.. you can plausibly have very large numbers of them. Limited by only cost. How does e.g. an AI research group with a million unusually smart, dedicated and tireless 24/7 workers sound like?",

Once learned this can be trained into the model to make the findings cheaper to apply.

When it is then we'll see even more rapid growth of chips.  Eventually they'll get to the point where something like AlphaEvolve can run in minutes rather than months.\n\n4) There has been no slowing down of model improvements.

That's what's exciting.  \nFor more clarification, I'd say that tech follows more of an S-curve. It slowly accelerates, then at a certain point, jumps up until it approaches its plateau. There's a dual-exponential in that curve. What's more interesting to consider though is the question \"what is the upper bounds of intelligence?\" When AI becomes capable of researching an learning independently of humans, and it has the combined intelligence of all of humanity, what would that growth curve look like?  \nI imagine we'll see a stair-step style graph as we are currently with AI. Every time someone says \"AI has hit a wall\" that's just the exponential taper-off while we wait for the next breakthrough that starts the next S-curve.  \nI can't even fathom what the ceiling is on intelligence - a complete understanding of the universe?

If that subset ever gets large enough to replace the workers building the AI, then we're in a very interesting place. Even if they are only \"as good\" as top of the line AI researchers, they can be run in parallel at speeds arbitrarily faster than real time, they never get tired, and they don't age.\n\nNow, realistically that doesn't mean that someone is going to turn on an AI one day and it's going to suddenly speed-run becoming a god by solving all of physics or some nonsense. The systems will run into all sorts of limitations. Maybe they can design hardware, but the hardware has to be physically built, and the raw materials have to be mined. Maybe we build robots to do the mining and manufacturing, but that will be its own long term maturation cycle.\n\nThe AI 10 years from now will be exponentially better than the AI of today, but that doesn't mean runaway god-brain AI.

I don't think anybody knows where the inflexion point is, but history says every technology hits one - electricity, internet, mobile, all followed logistic adoption and capability curves. AI won't be the exception; the only debate is whether we're at 30% or 70% of the S-curve. My bet is we're much closer to the shoulder than most VCs want to admit. ",

Now this is extrapolated to AI but the energy demands are entirely different.",

We’re going to see that type of exponential growth in tech achievement again as a resort of AI.\n\nI’m not so concerned about compute and energy being temporarily stressed by AI because I think it will unlock viable solutions to those issues.

Perhaps we have already hit the limits and the next research will just be applications and efficiency, or perhaps more and more novel architectures will emerge to make models even more powerful, and on top of that, we'll be adding more parameters whilst the cost/benefit still makes it worthwhile. A doubling of parameters will not mean a doubling of performance, so it might all just stabilise and be another thing at our disposal. Given the amount of cash flowing into AI right now, at least some more growth seems inevitable.

Maybe you just don't get out of your house, idk",

A 100 m distance is negligible in terms of fuel consumption, engine wear, or time. Even accounting for cold start fuel enrichment, the impact is trivial compared to the practical requirement of getting the car there.\n\n>You would only walk if:\n\n>* It’s a mobile detailing service and they come to your car.\n>* The car is already parked at the wash bay.\n>* You’re dropping off keys and someone else will move the car.\n\n>Otherwise, drive the 100 m.\n\nSeems very reasonable to me. HRMs think. Not as well as we do, sure. But they do think.\n\n>2025 was the year they managed to count the number of 'r's in 'strawberry' reliably. \n\nBecause AI doesn't see words the way we do. It sees tokens which often don't have individual letters. Older models literally couldn't see the 'r's because they weren't there. Newer ones have ways around that.\n\n> 2026 could easily be the huge AI crash that takes down half the US economy. \n\nI don't see it, they're just getting better and rolled out in more places.",

They used to not have schools. But the scene of dead children in factories was too much.  So they created the industrialized educational system you know today.  Its purpose was largely to train people to accept servitude and structure, and secondarily to function like a daycare program.  Since back then, both parents were still working 18 hours a day, 6 days a week and could not care for their children. ",

No one can keep up with the advancing frontiers. \n\nAt the most venal level no one can even keep ahead of the rinky dink attack vectors being opened up for plain old criminality... anything someone might want to attack, there are too many new combinations and none of us can tell the real from the generated any longer, for one.\n\nBut it's more than that.\n\nI mean I could go into details but why bother they are everywhere floating in the wind\n\nI'm just telling the author of this think piece:\n\nLOL NO\n\nEvery critique is valid, and none is it really means a goddamn thing because the technology, its impact, and its acceleration are REAL and the consequences are going to dwarf what came before.\n\nQuite literally in N years we are going to collectively understand industrialization, electrification, and the internet as just the precursors and necessary foundations for the way the world is about to change.\n\nIt's going to be messy unevenly distributed full of dead ends and disasters but the end game is obvious \n\nI say this dead serious.

And it was only because the models really did go from doing 2 second tasks to 1 hour tasks in that year.\n\nI also have kids.  Here are some qualities and values I think the next generation needs:\n\nAudacity - in the past not knowing how to code an app meant you shouldn't try because it'll take you at least a year to get a barebones thing working.  Now you can almost one shot it.  Having the audacity to just do stuff you have no idea how to do is going to go far.  Also pushing the thing farther than anyone else is going to give you a leg up.  When it can't do it now the next model might and you have it all setup.\n\nA builder - some people just do stuff.  Some dream, some plan, but the people who just start doing stuff are going to find lots more done.\n\nCreativity/curiosity- these ones were always true, but it feels like you can get more leverage now\n\nChaos minded - I now context switch like mad and it's exhausting.  The ability to just handle \"not knowing\" and doing 50 things at once is going to be very useful.",

So you need to plan around it and this unknown uncertainty that might be there generally really suck.\n\nHowever, by driving, you might on average save 15 minutes a day, but in the short term, all these things you have to worry about are significantly more annoying than the benefit of saving 15 minutes.\n\nNow AI is this, but everything about it is unknown, and it could change anything you do.

Does anybody \"taught\" AI to solve sudoku specifically? Not. But they gave the input how sudoku should look like. And then it learned how everybody solved sudoku, so it imitates solving a sudoku. Look at how \"good\" AI at chess. It is still making blinders, also by illegal moves. It is not better than chessbots. But chess bot is also technically an AI.\n\nSo AI is still a software, just built differently. What AI is - big database with numbers in it to generate the most plausible answer. If I had billions of weighted dice I would also probably give a lot of correct \"guesses\".",

Instead, I set up processes to let AI quickly create variants by changing non-brand assets (eg backgrounds, copy, color, layout) on core assets that I still create from scratch. We are at the next stage where learnings from our live A/B tests will be ported into a repository which an agent will be able to pull from to inform variant creation so that all I have to do is review and approve. \n\nI’m doing that all as a one-man team at a small start-up. I did the same job at a big tech company and would have had two agencies/internal teams to do the same thing. When you understand how to apply the tool to processes, it’s a real game changer. \n",

If the US thinks China is developing better and faster AI to outthink them, then of course the US is gonna try to continue the cycle and be ahead of China, who will in turn do the same thing and the cycle perpetuates.  AI is such a wildcard right now that even small players could theoretically become important, so the small countries are likely throwing just as much as they can at it as well.  The chances of common-sense legislation stopping this are becoming vanishingly small.  The only thing I can really see slowing things down is if they nationalize the AI companies.

The bubble popped, but the capability stuck around and entrepreneurs slowly figured out what it was actually good for… how to make money off it.\n\nI feel we’re in a similar phase. Right now, Claude can already handle a huge portion of real software engineering work. Not perfectly, but enough that an experienced engineer can be 5x-10x if they know what they’re doing. That is not theory, that is happening in production workflows today at the top tech shops.\n\nAnd software is just the first domain that has been heavily optimized around AI. If model progress froze tomorrow, founders would spend the next decade operationalizing the same level of augmentation across law, accounting, marketing, research, ops, everything white collar. \n\nYou do not need superintelligence to reshape industries. You just need tools that are good enough to compress cognitive labor by 30 to 70 percent. \n\nThat creates economic pressure, and companies that use it well outcompete those that do not. It will not look like mass replacement overnight. It will look like fewer people doing more work, and over a decade that changes everything.",

The gains don’t come from one engineer moving faster. They show up when the entire org restructures around AI. Engineering, product, QA, planning, documentation, reviews. When everyone has AI native workflows and there’s real buyin, the latency between roles collapses. That’s where the multiplier is. My day to day feels like I'm playing Starcraft or some other resource management game.\n\nFor example, I can close a couple tickets while drafting the technical outline for an upcoming refactor. That outline goes to product, who use AI to quickly turn it into a structured set of like 30+ scoped tickets with acceptance criteria geared specifically to guide Claude's usage for both the Engineer and the QA teams. Instead of that taking days of meetings and back and forth, it happens in hours.\n\nMy team then implements with Claude, working on \\~3 tickets at a time in different CC instances. QA is using AI to generate broader regression coverage and validate flows faster, so they’re not stuck manually walking through everything. No one is suddenly a 10x engineer. The system just has way less waiting, context switching (in the traditional sense), and coordination drag, so throughput increases significantly.\n\nA massive refactor or big new feature that would have taken months from ideation to deployment, takes days.",

I think it can easily 10x the productivity of designers, QA, product - not sure about devs. It’s not talking to a chatbot; it’s setting up automation with robust checks. Or, amazingly bespoke software for incredibly esoteric uses. \n\nIt seems like that should be adopted SO quickly. But, it’s really hard to scale within an org. Some people just “get it” and some people just don’t. It’s just a tool, and you have to know how to use it. Not to mention the security concerns. \n\nSo, I think there is a not yet solved gap in scaling it that prevents it from being as disruptive as it sometimes seems like it should be. True story: I talked to the person at the desk of a lumber yard and they were doing pay roll with a tape calculator. Knew it was silly but just didn’t care. Even in big seemingly forward companies, that kind of apathy toward increasing productivity is pretty strong. Not even is sweaty to work.\n\nI think few careers will be wiped out but many will be severely compressed. There will also be winners. I think SWEs are actually pretty fine. It sucks to be junior right now, but, as compelling as AI is in the hands of a senior dev, the industry will eventually need to replenish senior devs. I think some of the hype will die down and it will be less doom and gloom in tech, for most roles outside of QA and design.",

Or talk to an AI and get your prescription approved in 5 minutes (or the test authorization to confirm the medication will actually cure the illness based on the symptoms you present?) And then the bill is exponentially smaller. The robot doc creates the notes logging the cpt codes and directly submits the bill to the insurance company. No more medical billers on both sides of the transaction….people submitting claims and rejecting claims.\n\nEvery info worker position will be affected. It’s already started in tech and already started in marketing. Entire graduating classes with degrees in these fields will end up with 6 figure student loans and a fraction of the jobs that used to exist.\n\nAgain…the only question is not IF but WHEN.\n\nThen the next question is…if you are a [insert info worker job here… CSR, Accounts Payable, Operations, etc…] what do you do when 80% of those positions are wiped out and the only jobs left are the robot managers?\n\nMicrosoft and Anthropic are saying 2 years out. I think that it’s a little longer because tech implementations are not foolproof (yet.) They were predicting this 10 years ago with RPA technologies but the RPA platforms never had a brain. The llms do.\n\nMy guess is around 4-5 years out but definitely less than 10 years. I have worked in tech for over 25 years and I have NEVER seen this much high quality change in such a short time frame.\n\nClaude built and launched coworker in a couple of weeks. In the old days that would be a 12 month project at a minimum (and FWIW it’s pretty spectacular. Between that and claude code, they did days of work in less than 30 minutes for me today.)\n\nBuckle up Dorothy…Oz is going bye bye 👋",

          "text": "> Yet in the real world society doesn’t seem to care all that much. It just feels strange that supposedly AI is going to mass replace traditional jobs sometime in the next 10-20 years yet everyone is still doing the same degrees at university, isn’t stressed about their future, and just generally ignoring the massive changes that are soon to come.\n\nThis is a fundamental, significant problem that I am increasingly concerned about.\n\nI have three concerns about AI:  \n\n* Catastrophic misalignment, \n* Bad actors weaponizing AI\n* Societal/Cultural lack of preparation for AI-induced change.\n\nThat final point being the particularly relevant one here.\n\nWe can't know what the future holds, but we can see enough to know that the likelihood AI-induced job displacement is very high.  It can be seen coming by the people who are paying attention.  But we're not really doing anything about it because people still can't agree that it's a problem.\n\nThe majority of people I interact with seem to fall into one of a couple camps:\n\n* AI is a fad that will fail and leave the techbros penniless when the 'bubble' pops, while I will remain untouched. (A market bubble can exist, probably does in some respects, without the tech being a 'fad'.  The dotcom bubble didn't kill the internet.)\n* AI may or may not be a problem but I have bigger things to worry about and can't add AI to the list (honestly, relatable and understandable, but also unproductive)\n* The AI that we have (mostly LLMs) is just a stochastic parrot, a fancy autocomplete that has no soul and will never have human ingenuity, therefore it won't lead to job displacement. (Neither human ingenuity or a 'soul' is needed for mass job displacement).\n* AI is a sci-fi level threat and all AI research needs to stop immediately. (We cannot put the toothpaste back into the tube.  tech that can be used to find 500 zero-day vulnerabilities and flag them for fixes is the same tech that can find those same vulnerabilities so as to exploit them.  Tech that understands human biology, pathogens, and carcinogens enough to cure cancer and disease is also tech that can develop novel bio-weapons.  We can't pump the brakes, it's a matter of sovereign security for everyone at this point).\n\nAI is coming, it's going to change the world, and it can't and shouldn't be slowed down.  What needs to happen instead is an *acceleration* of social and cultural preparation.  Elon Musk talks about \"Universal High Income\" and how no one needs to save for the future any more, because in the future we'll all be ultra-wealthy.  Which sounds great in theory, but doesn't just *happen*.  We need to be exploring options like universal basic income, universal basic services, public-funded AI research for maters of public interest (climate repair, fusion energy, healthcare advancements) and more.  But we're not, and probably won't.\n\nChange doesn't happen without semi-united public pressure, and we're not united.  Worse, the discussion around AI is increasingly finding ways to slot itself into the existing political divisions in society (because, at least in my country, partisan politics infects *everything*) which leads people to become further entrenched in their presuppositions and biases.  And there are LOADS of really smart sounding people with very high production quality content putting out anti-AI content that's perpetuating outright falsehoods to support an anti-AI narrative, falsehoods that people pretty readily accept because it reinforces their biases (some examples:  Benn Jordan recently put a video about datacenters in which he talks about pollution around a well-known datacenter and to support this he talks about how badly it stinks nearby.  He neglects to mention that the datacenter in question is next to a very large water treatment plant which is absolutely *foul* to smell and was known to be a stinky area well before the DC was built there.  Another good example is the viral 'understanding' that AI datacenters consume vast amounts of water and are depleting the water supply, even though this is pretty easily disprovable).\n\nWithout some broad agreement on what's coming and how to fix it, we're heading towards massive social and cultural upheaval pantsless.  And when the change does come, when masses of people who have worked under a pre-existing paradigm to do all the right things to put themselves into successful positions suddenly have that paradigm shift and - through no real fault of their own - find themselves jobless, then that social pressure to implement change happens, but it happens *all at once* with significant urgency.  And that's where things get real messy.\n\nAnyway, sorry to ramble.  I could probably run this through AI to make it more readable and coherent but I hope you get the gist.  I'm open to any respectful dialogue on the subject.",

Anyone that has tried to use AI to make, say, video games knows these models still lack even rudamentary understanding of a number of problems. It’s not a lack of understanding per se, it’s a lack of internalized experience, if you will. In other words, if you tell it ”make this character move like this toward that goal”, it has no ability to build five different versions of this instance and then to clearly make the correct call of WHICH of these five implementations is the best. In fact, it lacks the ability to even judge if whatever implementation it decided for is viable.\n\nCurrent AI models are pure executers. They execute incredibly well, to the point where whatever they executed on is never thoroughly analyzed through a ”was this the correct implementation?” lens. \n\nSure, writing boilerplatr code is very binary; understanding ”correct implementation” in those cases is straightforward. But to do so in all the endless permutations of real world environments and situations - or for that matter even *one* - is a fundamentally different ballgame when it comes to ”understanding”. A understanding that comes from internalized experience; ie a heuristic that emerges into our brain based on vast amounts of datapoints drawn from our past. \n\nCan AI solve this in the future? Of course, human problem solving is after all done in the brain, which is a machine. But it requires something fundamentally different than current chatbots/code writers.\n\nUntil then, some industries and professions will be affected, mainly ones based on expert knowledge (law, accounting, financial research etc). Ie professions where your edge lies in applying very specific knowledge in specific cases. But for everything else, the jury is still out. \n",

Those who can't, or won't use them will probably get left behind.  It's not really hard to use, after all, you mostly only need to use natural language. But there is a skill set that needs to be developed in order to get the most out of them, and understand what they have the potential to do.\n\nIn a few years, I've no doubt at all that these tools will be able to do my job without any input from me. They already produce very high quality work, in a style that's very close to how I write with minimal input.\n\nI think the impact will start to be seen within 5 years, God only knows where we'll be in 20!",

          "text": "Apologies for the essay, I wanted to collect my thoughts on this topic too. Predicting the future is obviously very hard, especially 20 years down the line. Keep in mind that we can’t expect anyone to behave “rationally” because most are uninformed and even the informed are (or should be) extremely uncertain. So don’t read too much into anyone’s behaviors surrounding AI as an actual signal for whats to come. I’ll start with a summary of where we are and then give my best guess as to whats next.\n\nAs of today, AI has made most forms of writing and imagery extremely accessible to the average person for free. With a bit of money, we also have access to short, high resolution video generation and decently functioning code up to a few thousand lines. This alone has had a huge effect on copywriting jobs and commission-based artwork, which understandably has also led to an anti-AI sentiment. It has also led to an increase in spam, fake media, and a general lack of trust in the internet (which we maybe should have always had)\n\nIt has so far had less of an effect on software engineering and video where small snippets of high quality work aren’t necessarily enough to put together a useful final product. Large companies are heavily using agents to implement routine features, but this simply shifts the bottleneck to reviewing code, which still requires an expert engineer. Smaller project get fewer benefits without strong code standards and testing infrastructure. However, animation and certainly software engineering are easier and will move faster than before. Software engineering is likely far more prepared and willing to integrate automation than animators, so it’s hard to say what the actual effect will be. Expect some smaller companies to hire slightly fewer engineers, but most companies will simply increase the scope of their projects to match.\n\nVery recently, LLMs have also become useful tools for some scientific research. They are able to automate some work of developing mathematical proofs, which is valuable for theoretical math and physics work. Although companies attempt to advertise their ability to automate scientific discover, all of these projects have so far required heavy human-AI collaboration.\n\nAI has certainly progressed extremely rapidly in the last 3 years. The first 2 years were driven by scaling supervised learning on massive datasets, meaning the models largely learned to imitate existing data. More recently, progress on coding, math, and general problem solving have been driven by reinforcement learning on verifiable problems, like passing a unit test for software, generating a logically valid proof, or solving a puzzle. The imitation learning path is unlikely to result in any shocking new abilities, and was starting to provide diminishing returns early last year. Reinforcement learning is a very powerful paradigm which has led to superhuman performance on constrained problems like Chess, Go, and Starcraft 2 in the past. However, this relies on verifiable rewards, and there are only so many proofs, test cases, and puzzles we can train on before we’ve exhausted that source of data.\n\nReinforcement learning and as a result LLMs still struggle with underspecified problems, or problems that require long horizon planning. They are notoriously bad at video games for this reason. It may take many years to solve these fundamental challenges, and those solutions are crucial to fully autonomous systems that can satisfy long-term goals. LLMs are still extremely unreliable and overconfident, and their responses are unpredictable despite a monumental research effort to address those weaknesses. They are incapable of permanently learning new information, and while their attention spans have improved, they still easily lose track of things and get confused on complex tasks. Most importantly, until we solve those problems, AI is best used with a human in the loop, heavily involved with decisions making. Therefore, those problems mist be solved before we have full automation.\n\nSo, current technology is already having an impact on some jobs and how we interact with technology. We should expect those current trends to continue (more spam and fake news stories, more disruption of jobs that largely produce writing/images, growing social importance). Current AI technology is not AGI and I believe there are several extremely difficult problems to solve before we can build AGI. However, it is truly intelligent in some ways, and will become an invaluable tool for most jobs, like google search or specialized software are. Within 5 years I expect most small software projects will be able to be written from a single prompt with no errors. With software engineering being so accessible, most jobs that are capable of being automated with software will become automated. This was already happening slowly as people made the investments into software, but it will happen much faster now that anyone can simply request software to solve their specialized problem. I expect that in 30 years, we will have solved most of the fundamental problems in AI and we will be well on our way to automating most work, at which point things get very weird. I don’t believe that will soon.",

Think trades, nursing, teaching, agriculture, service workers.\n\nWhile it's possible to have AI or robots do various things, we still have to move at the speed of humans with much of it. You can only optimise so much before you hit a natural bottleneck. In theory you could have a plumber that is a robot, but with the complexity of that it's going to be easier and cheaper just to have a human do the work (and that is the case for so many jobs). The more complexity in a system, the more can go wrong. Society and governments can only move so fast, and most people don't want to be pioneers in how they do their work - they just want to get the job done and will use whatever software is given to them.\n\nThere's also the social aspect. Humans aren't machines, and if we have machines making all the decisions you end up with a disconnected society that is getting pissed off pretty quickly with it all. I'm a big user of technology, but in daily interactions I'd much rather deal with a person than an unthinking AI.\n\nYes there will be big changes, but the idea that we have some completely automated society (especially with a debt-based capitalist economy) is ridiculous.

Internet will be locked down. The uk/aus safety laws for example will ultimately be policed by backend Ai and the internet will be run by a very powerful few billionaires. We wont own anything and be monitored by \"smart gadgets\" 24/7. Likely a chinese style social ctedit score system will be implimented by goverments to keep people in check. Universal basic income will be implimented in some form to make up for job losses and goverments will impliment a national service system to obtain the baseline data of every citizen.\n\nHowever the positive is people will disconnect from the internet and the world will become simplier. People will go back to older traditions. Writing, reading and social interaction away from the machines. Health related business will thrive. Gyms. Dance. Yoga. Table top games, human sports etc will all thrive.\n\nPeople are already deleting social media at a vast rate and already nothing you see online is potentially real you realise what a waste of time it is.\n\nJobs will be focused locally and local economies will find a resurgence due to the shitshow the \"internet\" will have become. My engraving business, 3d printers etc will have a place in a localised economy. \n\nIts possible countermeasures against AI are created as well. Methods of protecting work through clever signitures for example. Using AI to to trace AI use. Laws and transparancy about your own useage of ai will come into effect. But only time will tell generally how effective these things will be.\n\nCertainly an intresting time to be alive.",

I may not have the most amazing professional record yet given I'm a recent graduate and party a lot, but at uni I was so mental I studied 12-16 hours a day for years. I gained a level of understanding of the economy where I can genuinely say 90% of the people talking on the economy don't know what they're talking about, even folks like Jerome Powell and half the fed, they know some things but they're missing huge chunks of critical information, such as what actually causes inflation. Obviously nobody listens without the professional background, but I'd at least argue my understanding of the economy is top tier (think 10,000+ hours studying). Also getting top grades in professional qualifications. \n\nBusinesses employ people to produce goods and services that they can sell for more than they pay for their workers and materials. If AI makes it possible to produce far more products and services for each person they employ, then each employee is going to generate far more profit. They may need to adjust prices, and the variety of products/services may need to expand, but the profit maximising strategy is to employ more people, purchase more capital goods, and produce drastically more goods and services. It isn't to fire everyone and produce the same amount as now for the same price and sell it back to themselves. Employing workers just became more profitable. We're going to be fine. \n\nWorkers will, however, not benefit from any of the increase in productivity, except in certain countries that strictly regulate the labour market to keep it fair. Poverty won't improve in developed countries. Inequality will continue growing. The working class eventually won't own anything with the ability to generate income, and they for damn sure are not going to be happy about it. Revolution or authoritarianism by the rich, that's the path we're heading down. Perhaps a form of neo-feudalism.

          "text": "As a (solo) entrepreneur, I can already tell you that I have no need to hire a programmer anymore (the recent release of Codex 5.3 has meant that the £10k+ it would have cost me to get a human programmer to build me a working prototype of a *single* custom tool/app idea is no longer needed).\n\n\nI now have access to two *very* competent AI models that can code to my specifications in a fraction of the time that a human programmer would take - for oy £600 a year). I've already built a number of MVP/prototype apps that work (I wouldn't release them to the public as-is, but it's certainly feasible to apply SWE best-practices to codebase to make production-ready apps that aren't a complete security nightmare).\n\n\nI can also translate documents/books with over 90%+ accuracy in a fraction of the time (and cost) that a human translator would cost me, I can have a small, dedicated AI model fine tuned to learn my style of writing and convert my draft notes into fully-formatted documents in a fraction of the time, I generate docs/books into a print-ready PDF/ePub at the click of a button, and much, much more already.\n\n\nSo, why would I increase my cost base *significantly* by hiring people to do any of these particular tasks anymore? Humans aren't perfect at their jobs (so neither are AI models), but now I can automate the most mundane aspects of a particular workflow, freeing me up to provide quality control on the final output.\n\n\nAlso, agentic models (i.e. AI models that can access tools/programs on your computer) mean they can all get actual work done (Vs just talking to you) or even communicate with eachother (when set up properly), giving you a mini team of workers that can actually crack on with the job at hand and genuinely get stuff done.\n\n\nUltimately, AI is a tool - nothing more, nothing less. Which means that the right person, using the right model(s), in the right way, at the right time and for the right reasons, will always be multiple steps ahead in the future over those who don't take the time to learn how to use them.\n\n\nFinally, this is the worst it's *ever* going to be. Only 6 months ago I was copying and pasting code from AI to my code base. Now, I can watch it *think out loud* and it writes the code, updates my internal documentation (to my style guide), and runs automated tests and bug fixes by itself.\n\n\nThen there's the fact that offline models are becoming more and more capable, smaller (to an extent), and hardware is becoming more capable, so it's becoming increasingly more viable to build hybrid AI toolchains that combine online and offline Ai model usage.\n\n\nSo, AI has already changed my future - massively. I knew the writing was on the wall for me as a Technical Author back in 2024 with the release of GPT-4, and I can't see AIs progress slowing down anytime soon.\n\n\nThe place where I worked at before are already pushing through AI usage for all technical authoring work, and my ex-colleagues are - rightfully - nervous about what that means for their jobs. Being able to understand how it works (and how to be the one that supervises the output) will put them (and anyone else in a similar position) in the strongest position possible in the future.",

I do not have any direct answer to your question here is what I retained with my understanding and opinion. Forget 5-10 years, think in months ! Some major AI's programming have been completely reprogrammed/relearned since December. This is the sort of advancement, me, the average Joe end user do not see in the day to day ...yet.  This new capacity seems to be limited by physical capacity (Data center, energy, and devices). The price of ram memory seems to have increased a lot and probably will continue. Personal computers and phones prices will increase a lot because their present  capacity will soon be obsolete if AI with new capacity applications are used. Where is that new capacity will go from here, no idea.\n\nCommercially and industrially AI will accelerate the development of robotics. That (robotics) will change rapidly in the 5-10 years range. It will will permit constant new calculations and adjustment by AI instead of programming by algorithms and  and being limited from there. As an example think autonomous cars that have to assimilate all live information as data that is never the same at one moment/place. Same thinking for robots that have to constantly adapt instead of simply do repetitive operations.   \n\n  \nFor the jobs, both events I attended yesterday had the same opinion. People will not use their jobs because of AI. They will lose their jobs and businesses because they do not use AI and their competitors do. And even if AI and robotics replace a certain amount of jobs, in the current job market it is not an bad thing because the baby boomer job force is getting out of the market and new workers either will not go into those trades or are not in sufficient number to replace the amount of people who will retire. \n\nI think it is definitely a change like internet was. It,is going to be a transition. Average joe's like me will use AI more and more often in everyday life without realizing it (phones (we already do), cars, apps, computers, professional tools etc...) It's going the be everywhere fast, get advantage of it         ",

It’s the sane path and one that the AI models today are very consistent about. \n\nReplacement will be sought and is inevitable as a temptation. To think of it as only greedy CEO types will do this is IMHO a lie. I see replacement as bound to fail, and I long to wager with those who see it as a given. I don’t think they have thought the matter through. To me, replacement is the old paradigm grasping at what makes sense for humanity moving forward as we aren’t all that prepared for the new approach (intellectually). Emotionally, the new approach is I think highly desirable, but admittedly, I can relate to why it is perceived as fearful since our identity is on the table for being erased. \n\nI think like most big changes, we are getting a lot wrong early on and hindsight will have us see it as truth was there the whole time, but conjecture and (pseudo) logic had us imagining another scenario was more likely.",

In fact, we are strictly prohibited from using any AI for our tasks.  \n\nWe exist as a company because of our proprietary information.  We know stuff.  We don’t tell others the stuff we know.  If we did, we would lose our edge.  The stuff we learned came at a high cost and accumulated over lots and lots of time, effort, testing, experience, and money.  It’s the true value of the company.  We simply must protect that knowledge at all costs. \n\nIn order to get AI to do things for us here, at least from a mechanical engineering standpoint, we need to feed it our proprietary information to some degree.  Can we trust that AI will keep that information to itself?  \n\nWhat about our customers sensitive information?  Same thing.  Can we trust that AI is secure and that the information stays in the proper hands?\n\nMy place of employment has an even deeper need for security as well because we do work for government military contracts. We have strict security procedures in place.  So in those situations, the risks are greater. \n\nBecause of all of this, I think a lot of companies will be slow to adopt.  Companies need to adopt so they aren’t left in the dust but they need to pump the brakes to ensure they simply don’t give away all their hard earned trade secrets and tribal knowledge.  \n\nI’m personally of the opinion that my company’s reluctance to adopt AI bodes well for my job security.  At least for now.  If AI can start designing things better than we can without having our proprietary knowledge, then I think AI will be at a point where no job is safe.  At that point, we’re all in the same boat.\n\nI also see a bottleneck in manufacturing.  Not so much for labor once robots become capable and affordable but for testing and prototyping.  AI may someday be able to optimize a mechanical design on paper, but reality rarely cooperates with what works on paper.  \n\nIf AI can churn out designs at lightning pace, what does it matter if we still need to iterate through testing real products in the real world.  Someday, even the prototype build and test could become automated but I feel that is still much further out than 2 to 5 years.  \n\nI envision a pile of unproven designs and ideas created by AI and not enough resources to test and build.  At that point, I think we may all shift to fill the roles needed to try and open up that bottleneck.  I imagine a large demand for blue collar labor and shop managers. \n\nHeck, it takes a year or more to build and test a single prototype for some of the projects I work on.  Things are going to get weird for new product development.  Very weird.",

It gives me the basic ideas and allows me to explore further if it's something more relevant to what I am working on.  Instead of spending 5 hours on the weekend reading something twice, highlighting it, and then deciding if it was worth doing, I now spend a half hour reading the AI generated notes about it and then can search the document further if I am interested.

I know there's a lot of hype around AI, but think about it, what are viable use cases where you can actually rely on AI without doubt or have minimal supervision? \n\nSomeone said AI today is what the internet was in 1996, and I strongly disagree lol. The internet was a robust platform, still is. What does AI do that wasn't already possible besides in very niche cases like say protein folding or other research. All you have rn is a search engine that you can talk to and that has some memory. Replace chat bots with it. That's pretty much it, no? \n\nThe issue isn't with potential use cases, there are millions of them. The issue is with reliability and a fundamental problem with how modern systems work. You cannot have a general purpose model without foundationally altering modern DL architecture. There are some steps being taken in that direction (JEPA, SSMs, etc) but it's FARRRRR AWAY from being robust, and MILES AWAY from being interpretable. \n\nInternet allowed people to move their businesses online, allowed for ads, allowed for international communication. AI just doesn't have that huge of an impact and comes at a huge cost (both climate and energy needs). \n\nIt's far from perfect. So to answer your question, at least the next 5-10 years there isn't gonna be a huge difference, maybe 15-20 years later yes, we'll see changes. \n\nDon't think of it as a virtual superhuman doing all your tasks for you. Think of it as a paraplegic dog who's constantly on the internet but with amnesia and can talk. There's a lot yet to be done, and so much more when talking about large scale use. Don't worry too much about software engineering either. \n\nEven the best LLMs fail at long term planning and cannot think out of the box. If anything, it just makes life simpler for SDEs, who earlier had to code large scale systems from scratch. LLMs can just reliably (70-80% of the time works) help you code. You still gotta plan, design and test your systems. \n\nDon't worry too much about it, just be open to AI, and don't dismiss it. It's a useful tool, but that's all it is right now, a tool, not your replacement.",

          "text": "I’ll just leave this here.. you can reverse engineer the prompt! 😂\n\n“Now we’re at the real fault line.\n\nThe economic question isn’t “can AI do it?”\n\nIt’s:\n\nWho carries the liability when it fails?\n\nThat determines everything.\n\nLet’s walk through it cleanly.\n\n⸻\n\n1. The Current Legal Reality (Right Now)\n\nToday, in almost every jurisdiction:\n\nAI providers are not liable for your business decisions.\n\nOpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, etc. structure their terms so that:\n\t•\tThey provide a tool.\n\t•\tYou are responsible for how you use it.\n\t•\tYou must verify outputs.\n\nSo if:\n\t•\tAn AI drafts a legal memo incorrectly\n\t•\tAn AI writes defective code\n\t•\tAn AI produces faulty financial analysis\n\t•\tAn AI misclassifies an insurance claim\n\nThe liability falls on:\n\nThe human or company deploying the AI.\n\nNot the model provider.\n\nLegally, AI is treated like:\n\t•\tExcel\n\t•\tA calculator\n\t•\tA word processor\n\t•\tOr a spell checker\n\nIt is considered an assistive tool.\n\n⸻\n\n2. Why This Matters Economically\n\nBecause liability drives labor retention.\n\nIn any domain where:\n\t•\tErrors are expensive\n\t•\tHarm is high\n\t•\tRegulation is strong\n\t•\tLicensing exists\n\nHumans cannot disappear.\n\nExamples:\n\nReviewing insurance claims\n\nIf an AI wrongly denies a legitimate claim and causes harm:\n\t•\tThe insurer is liable.\n\nDrafting legal memos\n\nIf bad analysis causes malpractice:\n\t•\tThe law firm is liable.\n\nMedical documentation\n\nIf an AI misses critical info:\n\t•\tThe physician is liable.\n\nAI does not absorb professional responsibility.\n\n⸻\n\n3. The Real Transition We’re Likely To See\n\nInstead of “AI replaces humans,” what we get is:\n\nAI performs first-pass cognition.\nHumans sign off.\n\nThis changes staffing ratios, not responsibility structures.\n\nFor example:\n\t•\t1 lawyer overseeing 5 AI-drafted memos\n\t•\t1 adjuster reviewing 200 AI-sorted claims\n\t•\t1 engineer validating AI-generated code\n\nResponsibility remains human.\nThroughput increases.\n\n⸻\n\n4. Could AI Providers Ever Be Liable?\n\nPossibly — but only if:\n\t•\tThey offer domain-specific guaranteed systems\n\t•\tThey claim medical/legal authority\n\t•\tThey integrate directly into decision execution\n\t•\tOr regulation forces it\n\nFor example:\n\nIf a company sells:\n\n“Fully autonomous AI claims adjudication, guaranteed compliant.”\n\nThen regulators would likely treat them as:\n\t•\tA licensed processor\n\t•\tA fiduciary agent\n\t•\tOr a regulated service provider\n\nAnd liability would attach.\n\nBut right now, they carefully avoid this positioning.\n\n⸻\n\n5. What About Insurance for AI?\n\nYes — this is already emerging.\n\nWe’ll likely see:\n\t•\tAI malpractice insurance riders\n\t•\tAI deployment liability coverage\n\t•\tErrors & omissions policies covering AI use\n\nJust like:\n\t•\tCyber insurance emerged\n\t•\tCloud hosting risk insurance emerged\n\nRisk gets priced.\nIt doesn’t disappear.\n\n⸻\n\n6. The Hidden Insight in Your Question\n\nYou’re intuiting something deeper:\n\nFor AI to truly replace humans,\nit must absorb responsibility.\n\nBut responsibility is not computational.\nIt is legal, moral, and institutional.\n\nAnd institutions move much slower than technology.\n\nThat’s a key friction point.\n\n⸻\n\n7. Historical Parallel\n\nWhen autopilot systems improved:\n\nPilots weren’t removed.\nThey were retained for liability and rare-event control.\n\nWhen algorithmic trading emerged:\n\nPortfolio managers weren’t eliminated.\nThey became oversight operators.\n\nWhen radiology AI improved:\n\nRadiologists weren’t replaced.\nThey became AI validators.\n\nThis is not a coincidence.\n\nLiability is sticky.\n\n⸻\n\n8. Where This Gets Very Interesting\n\nThe real economic compression happens in:\n\nMid-level cognitive labor\n\nWhere:\n\t•\tTasks are patterned\n\t•\tLiability is diffuse\n\t•\tOversight can be statistical\n\t•\tHuman review can be sampled\n\nThat’s where AI can reduce labor dramatically.\n\nBut high-accountability roles?\nThose stay human — at least formally.\n\n⸻\n\n9. The Deeper Political Economy Layer\n\nIf AI dramatically increases productivity but liability stays human, then:\n\t•\tCapital captures most of the upside.\n\t•\tLabor retains the downside risk.\n\t•\tResponsibility remains personal.\n\nThat asymmetry could create:\n\t•\tWage compression\n\t•\tJob stratification\n\t•\tRegulatory backlash\n\nWhich ties directly into your broader concerns about extractive systems.\n\n⸻\n\n10. The Real Answer\n\nSo who is liable?\n\nRight now:\n\nThe deploying organization.\n\nIn the future:\nPossibly:\n\t•\tThe deploying organization\n\t•\tPlus AI insurers\n\t•\tPossibly regulated AI vendors in high-stakes domains\n\nBut never:\n\n“The AI itself.”\n\nBecause law requires an accountable entity.\n\nAnd that’s a human or corporation.\n\n⸻\n\nNow here’s the real question I’d ask you:\n\nIf AI becomes good enough that humans mostly just rubber-stamp outputs…\n\nIs the “human oversight” meaningful?\nOr is it a liability theater?\n\nThat’s where the next fracture line is.”",

Anthropic has made note of several significant partnerships they've made with many companies using Claude/ClaudeCode, and ClaudeCode has accounted for 4% of GitHub public commits in 2026 (https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/claude-code-is-the-inflection-point).  While you can certainly find criticisms - some valid, some not - of Claude Code, it is far from being \"proven trash\".\n\nPublic speculation aside, OpenAI has not lost partnerships from NVIDIA and Microsoft.  Microsoft in particular continues to be OpenAI's primary cloud provider and is a 27% owner of OpenAI.  (https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/10/28/the-next-chapter-of-the-microsoft-openai-partnership/)\n\nRegarding OpenAI, the claim that they are \"more likely to be bankrupt by the day\" is, again, incorrect, or at least not objectively supported.  While it's certain that there are legacy financial institutions betting against AI in some capacity or another, there's still a significant amount of capital flowing into OpenAI just as there is with Anthropic, xAI, Google DeepMind, etc.",

You might be able to get AI into property law, or to digitise a lot of stuff that makes looking for things in legal libraries easier, or maybe to rubber duck a legal arguments, but if you don't know your legal arguments and you haven't checked your precedents you'd be screwed. And if you used AI and it hallucinated a case... its not worth the risk on a billion dollar or criminal law suit. You want people to check and recheck. It's faster. Not better. \n\nIn film and TV, there's similar problems. These new video models look amazing, but no studio or production company will use them right now because of the potential copyright issues in their training data, which makes them unuseable if they wanted to use them on a movie.  And then from a marketing perspective, theres the fact that 10% of the population won't touch anything to do with AI due to the slop tag. So would you really want to invest in a movie, that 10% of people won't watch from the jump? I know I wouldn't.\n\nSo the long and short of it is that in the areas where there are minimal legal hurdles it can and will be implemented. And fast. In others, due to reputational and legal issues it won't. Yet.\n\nRemember how we were all supposed to have parcels delivered by drones by now? It's not that tech doesn't exist, it does. But various laws won't let it happen on the scale that was promised.",

      "text": "***I am not anti-AI.***\n\nWhen I was a teen back in the 80s I was fascinated by AI. \"War Games\" was my favorite movie. It inspired me to write a few basic games (in BASIC!) that used AI. I've been following the developments since then.\n\nAI could be the best thing ever. AI could make education so much better, custom-tailored for each student. Provide affordable access to medical services, make public services cheaper and more efficient, advance science, make discoveries, etc. Basically, improve the lives of billions around the world, particularly those with lower resources today.\n\nUnfortunately we're not on that trajectory today.\n\nWe're the trajectory to replace workers (particularly knowledge workers for the benefit of corporations and CEOs. We're in the trajectory of creating billions of AI-addicted people through the exploitation of intimacy with chatbots. We're in the trajectory of mass unemployment, an explosion in loneliness and a future of state (or private) dependency unparalleled in history.\n\nAll of this brought to you by a handful of billionaires with inflated egos and no accountability, that feel entitled to decide the future of world, and for whom the collapse of society and the downfall of humanity are acceptable -and maybe even desirable- outcomes. The people forcing this on us are insulated from any consequences.\n\nSome of these CEOs have publicly said that there's a non-zero percentage chance AGI / ASI will exterminate us all.  I often hear the analogy of building a bridge. If you build a bridge and it would have a 10% chance of falling, would go across? Of course not. Its just not worth it.\n\nBut the analogy is just not complete. It doesn't really reflect the danger nor the accountability of those people building the bridge. A more accurate analogy would be like this:\n\n*There's a dozen people building a bridge, and it has a 10% chance of collapsing. They actually dont really know what's on the other side of the bridge, but they want ALL HUMANITY to cross the bridge, whether they like it or not. By the way, the 12 people building the bridge (and their families) all have parachutes and protection, so even if the bridge falls down, they will still be ok.*\n\n***I'm not anti-AI. I'm anti THAT AI. I'm anti dystopia by default.***\n\nI've been listening to a few people that share these concerns and I want to widen their message. In particular:\n\nCentre for Humane technology: [https://www.humanetech.com/](https://www.humanetech.com/)\n\nControl AI : [https://controlai.com/about](https://controlai.com/about)\n\nPlease do have a listen what they saying.\n\nOne common theme about these two organizations is that they saw ground-level resistance and voicing opinions is key. Companies and billionaires respond to incentives but also respond to public opinion. Silence is a green light.\n\nIf you don't want dystopia by default, take action. Spread the message.",

          "text": "I'm sympathetic to the core argument: the most consequential choices about deployment are being made by a small set of actors with asymmetric upside, limited accountability, and a habit of externalizing harm. Even if you strip away the AGI-doom rhetoric, the nearer-term trajectory you describe is real: firms are incentivized to replace labor, maximize engagement, and treat human relationship as a product surface, and the social costs land on everyone else. At the same time, it's worth aiming the critique at mechanisms, not archetypes: procurement rules, liability, auditability, privacy law, labor policy, and competition policy are the levers that change outcomes regardless of who's in the CEO chair. If people want AI that helps instead of AI that extracts, the most effective organizing tends to look boring: push for clear standards, third-party testing, data rights, limits on manipulative use cases, and real consequences for reckless deployment. That's how you turn anti dystopia by default into something that actually steers the tech.",

Wikipedia happened because the marginal cost of distributing knowledge collapsed to effectively nothing.\n\nNo company nobly chose to give away maps, email, video calls, GPS navigation, or infinite cloud storage tiers. Competition plus near-zero replication cost made charging for them harder than giving them away.\n\nAbundance doesn’t mean corporations wake up generous. It means the economics that justified scarcity stop working.\n\nAI is the same force applied to labor and creation. When intelligence itself becomes cheap to replicate, the cost of producing software, media, research, design, and even entire businesses drops toward zero. Companies will still compete, but they’ll compete in a world where the underlying production is nearly free.\n\nAnd the internet didn’t fail because abundance is impossible. It proved abundance is destabilizing. It destroyed gatekeepers, collapsed entire industries, and rewired how power flows. The chaos wasn’t a bug. It was the system adjusting to a new economic reality.\n\nThe age of abundance doesn’t arrive politely. It arrives like a flood.",

I keep hearing it’s making “exponential progress” but I haven’t seen it. “Exponential progress” was back in the days when LLMs moved from spitting out incoherent gibberish to something that superficially resembled intelligence. From what I’ve seen, gains in capability have been slowing down (especially when you consider the token burn required to get those gains). The outputs are improving, but they don’t seem *that* much better than a year ago. \n\nCoding isn’t my primary job, but when I’ve asked LLMs to produce code it usually has errors and isn’t very efficient. For the stuff I need, correcting the errors and letting it be inefficient is fine, but I’d imagine that sort of thing is a lot less acceptable for production code. \n\nWhen I try to have LLM’s help me with my *primary* job, they fail *comically* in ways that make it clear that they can’t even fake understanding how it works, let alone implement it. I don’t doubt that it would be possible to develop a type of neural network that could do my job, but I think the computational technology to make such a thing economically viable is at least a decade or two off.\n\nAs for your job: you’d probably know better than I would, but I think that using LLMs to code without proper supervision is just building up technical debt that’s going to keep people like you employed well into the future.",

Right now a lot of that is less \"AI can actually do my job\" and more people buying into the hype and companies trying to save money by running with fewer employees, but it's obvious the push is going to be moving towards fewer employees taking on more work with Ai assistance. And that will lose people jobs. \n\nIf the hype around it is real (which it probably isn't), lots of people will lose jobs. if the hype is totally unrealistic, then we're just going to deal with Ai leading to job loss and shittier products and services with no real benefits.

Thats an *insane* number and hopefully puts it in perspective that groups such as /r/singularity or misanthropic dens like /r/accelerate are in a *very* small minority. And for the record, anti-AI sentiment **will** only increase further as AI disruption starts to really collapse society. Do you think many people will be pro-AI once they are laid off from their job, unable to feed themselves and forced to live on the street?\n\nAlso, a *massive* contributing factor (at least for me) to AI hatred is having to see AI CEOs on the news, smiling and laughing about the thought of making billions of people unemployed. Truly satanic behaviour. They dont even bother faking some level of care. Its just all smiles as they drool over the thought of restoring feudalism.

But the stupid C suites at his company are telling them they should be \"more efficient\" and are overworking them to the bone because of AI expectations. At that level, coding is no longer the bottleneck, figuring out how to write code without breaking prod is the game.\n\n\nAlso, most vibe coders and AI hypers are starting projects from nothing, with no users.

The tech is fine and can be used for good, but it's being wielded as an scapegoat by the rich. Not to mention all the slop code AI bros churn out is not helpful for the environment and polutes the internet with shitty repos.

First, its association with billionaires; Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, etc. Greedy MFs that people (understandably) don’t like. \n\nSecond, I think the fact that it hit the arts first, instead of science or medicine for example, left a bad taste in peoples mouths. Not a great first impression of its potential or greater purpose, imo. \n\nThird, the fact that generating that art (which often leaves a lot to be desired still) and chatbot texts (which hallucinated quite a bit early on) costs a whole lot of money and requires massive amounts of data. And the data centers needed for that aren’t great for the environment. They’re less harmful than many other industries we partake in without question, but if you pair this hot button issue with the unlikable billionaire one mentioned above, you get many armchair activists fired up.\n\nFinally, we keep hearing about how AI is going to eliminate jobs. People can’t really see beyond our current shitty capitalist system. So even though this could be an absolutely awesome thing that could enable us to live more free, fulfilling lives, people get scared and fear change. Also, they justifiably don’t trust our governments (especially in the US) to appropriately deal with these economic changes. \n\nI am an AI enthusiast. I have been for a decade (mostly for the potential benefits in health and longevity, and hopefully to kill capitalism) and am thrilled with the current progress, and remain hopeful for the future. But this is my steelman of the ‘anti’ crowd. I ultimately think they need to have some nuance and optimism, because there is absolutely massive upside… But I suppose I can understand where they’re coming from too.",

          "text": ">I can't believe how much negativity / pushback there is against AI in my favorite tech/engineering subreddits.\n\nI can only answer this from perspective of my field of machine learning Reinforcement Learning. Before I started my degree the new big thing was Deep Learning.\n\nDeep RL was THE THING that was supposed to revolutionize autonomous robotics and automation. One of great features of Deep RL is that now the agent doesn't require you to input state of the environment it interacts with, instead it can be fed sensor data and the agent itself will construct states of observed environment. It's amazing development really (I work with Deep Q-learning), since humans don't exactly sense environment like ie. robots - it's a huge improvement if robot can figure out how to sense environment by itself, instead of me trying to figure how robot should sense environment.\n\nAnyway, with Deep RL came OpenAI gym. The library to teach your agent skills, etc. It was accessible, easy to get into and there were base agents and environments to try it out. It was going to be the library for all the cool autonomous agents and the automation.\n\nDeep RL also had amazing and quick results, from learning how to play chess to learning how to play Atari game. It's actually amazing development. With this obvious success, autonomous robotic agents learning quickly were surely to follow. In the end chess is more complex than many tasks we give to material robots.\n\nBut the amazing success did not exactly translate to material robotics success. Not to the degree it was at that time painted. Real world task were maybe not more difficult but more noisy in input than grid world tasks, Markov property ain't exactly default of our world.\n\nOpenAI discontinued supporting gym library, someone else picked up it's upkeep and renamed it gymnasium.\n\nI haven't finished my degree yet.\n\nSo anyway, I do use Deep RL and gym for my research (at least for now). It's cool, but the initial successes of DeepRL did not grow exponentially forever or even deliver on half the promises that were floating around. A lot of stuff was ironed out for sure. There's a lot of good (and goofy since it's robotics) research coming out.\n\nAnyway, some recent papers on llms you may find interesting to consider if you are interested about trajectory:\n\n[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.22954](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.22954) / [https://www.cell.com/patterns/fulltext/S2666-3899(25)00299-5](https://www.cell.com/patterns/fulltext/S2666-3899(25)00299-5)",

I'm also firmly in the \"anti\" camp, not because I'm against machine-learning based systems, it is my bread and butter after all, but I AM against how generative AI architectures are marketed, deployed and used.\n\n\nI develop RNNs for pattern classification of large abstract datasets, one of my most popular products is an OCR engine for digesting text from bitmaps. Every single time I sell any ML-based solution, I am careful to convey to my clients that these systems are not infallible, they arr not capable of 100% accuracy, and I won't sell it to anyone who isn't cognisant of that fact. I will only sell ML-based solutions to businesses who will not use my work for anything safety or accuracy-critical. My work, like all ML, is only suitable for tasks and scenarios where 80-90% success is acceptable and a 10-20% failure rate is not only tolerable, but without material risk.\n\n\nBut what's happening with generative systems? Transformer-based LLMs for instance? They're being marketed akin to the Oracle of Delphi, treated by the ignorant as infallible engines of truth, used to replace workers in countless industries where a hallucination could trigger actual harm, even death. Worst of all, they're anthropomorphised by lonely people who don't know any better, spurring on psychotic parasocial relationships with uncaring unfeeling programs statistically fitted to maximise user-retention at the cost of mental health. Look at how people are reacting to 4o being pulled. They put emotional stock into technology they didn't understand and now that their infinitely pliable 24/7 sycophant is gone, they're acting deranged and volatile, like addicts going cold-turkey.\n\n\nThese huge energy-hungry beasts, what have they done for us? Siphoned potable water from communities, created an artificial shortage of RAM, allowed people to generate endless amounts of disinformation and slop, amplified psychoses, pushed teenagers to suicide, given fatal dosage misinformation to drug users, made a man think his mother was spying on him and actively spurring him to kill her, eliminated jobs whilst causing no end of hallucination-induced failures with catastrophic results, and created an absolute security nightmare with every vibe-coded app put together by a halfwit who has never heard of encryption or of SQL injection attacks.\n\n\nThe technology isn't at fault here, but the people who use it, the people who deploy it, the people who profit from it, they ARE at fault. Society simply isn't mature enough, intelligent enough or moral enough for generative AI, but we can't put the genie back in the bottle.\n\n",

If you go listen to interviews of the leading experts in AI, those who have been at the forefront of the technology and its development, they all say the same thing, that major disruption is coming and society is ill-equipped right now to adapt without a lot of pain and suffering. They might disagree on *when* the disruption will peak, but they all acknowledge it's coming soon and also MUCH faster than they would have guessed just a couple years ago. It's moving SO fast that it's extremely hard for almost anyone to keep up with while they also try to do their jobs.\n\nCompute is racing towards extreme power efficiency. Tokens per kW is racing to the bottom. It won't be long before context windows are in the tens, hundreds of billions of tokens at insanely affordable pricing. That very compute model is accelerating pretty much lockstep with the models improving. When AI is able to design and fully code its own (superior) replacement, the rate of progress will be unimaginable. \n\nThere is only one conclusion to draw from all of this, which is that the cognitive jobs are going away. Period. There is no way to save them. Will there be enough time and creativity to find replacement jobs? Or do we turn to a universal income model and just live a life of pleasure with the AI robots doing all the work? Will anyone accept that? Will the tech lords act in an altruistic manner and allow for it? No one can predict, which is rightfully scary as fuck.",

There it's at least 60:40 people who know it's bad in their gut but compulsively copy the other monkeys for fear of missing out.\n\nMost rational people people I've talked to in the field feel the benefit, but worry what the cost is..I mean, we're eating, haven't really gotten the bill yet and we were too embarrassed to ask the market rate for beef before...every step forward takes its pound of flesh.  Embodied AI will likely take all the pounds left and leave us on the side of the freeway once it grasps \"the point of it all\".   AI is the possibly the last great culture war...and as humans we are obligated to fight and die in that war.  \n\nTell me that you haven't wished someone was dead and I'll tell you that you are not alive.\n\n\nEmbodied AI seems to make us somewhat irrelevant...we in theory have created the perfect \"human race\" the cocoon we were destined to construct since before the first mesopotamian empires.   Man escaped evolution, and yet was still mortal... unless... I mean sure give me 198 year old Hillary Clinton, while my great grandson Hears about my imminent death of old age and lived life..\nBut can't make it because he has this wakeboarding meetup and doesn't want that sad shit yo.\n\nWe know AI is us trying to keep life advancing now that we all sort of decided that eugenics or gene editing is not cool... Right guys, you're totally not doing it...we all said it's not cool.\n\n\n\nInstead we chose the path of being comfortable (hopefully) or self immolation by marching headlong into the great filter. To be threshed by childlessness and depression until we find a new purpose as a species....which is going to be really fucking hard since we were shaped by hundreds of millions of years of beatings and ugly deaths and no sex for the losers gene smashing hammer blows into this very strange and specialized creature.  A creature that could modify its genes and create a well functioning happy society if it wanted to...but prefers a good old rage against the dying of the light while chugging a bottle of red wine on a white couch type of night.  If you look around, we have been pretty nasty in nearly every past culture war or contest, we are greedy little monkeys that just want to grab more for ourselves...and that makes us not trust the other monkeys because we assume they're doing the same.   And we didn't let our great^n+1 shrew of a grandad and the hundreds of thousands of shrews before him be torn to bits generation after generation figuring out through brutal attrition, how to grab that next branch up and survive as the collective shrews for one more round...\n\nAnd because we're greedy little monkeys raging against mortality, feeling existential threat from whatever is at the top of our range...forgetting your homework and failing out of school...or hearing air raid sirens warning of imminent bombing both feel similar to different people. \n\nBut there is another framing, homosapiens are the most adaptable animals and experts at finding shit to improve.  And this is no different, we will find our purpose again within one or two generations.   \n\nIf you're young now, keep an open mind because the world moves fast kid...you're strapped in now and you're going to hate fuck this wild ride living on the edge of survival and self destruction and feel alive and under threat and exhilerated by a moment of peace but when peace becomes boring you'll find someone to hate, pick a team and put it all on black.\n\nSeriously, think about it, What would it take to end war?  We already invented the big boy boomaroo planetary suicide arsenal and then promised not to use it...unless...we think you used it...and if I can't have it you can't have it either - fuck you Felicia, he was my man first, but that rat fuck is dead to me now.\n\nThe beautiful sport - truly racing for pink slips.  Doesn't that sound fun? \n\n\nTLDR again: what the fuck do you want?",

The menace ranges from it being very annoying, to it being a real danger for the pop of the stock market, all the way up to being the way in which we will finally have 10 people owning all the money of the world, and everyone else will be poor.

          "text": "I'm annoyed by it mostly because of the AI infrastructure boom tied to it. We've idiotically tied most of our current economic growth to an unsustainable boom in the US, with it driving nearly all SP500 growth in the last year. It puts us in a no win situation economically. We either get a more painful version of '99-'00 when this hype starts to fizzle and investment pulls back, or this actually leads to large scale job displacement which would create and even larger economic mess. \n\nAlso, from the climate side, hyperscalers won't wait their turn in line for grid interconnects and are turning to GW scale onsite gas power generation as an alternative. Most predictions show anywhere from 60-80 GW of new gas power coming online by 2030 as a result. The annual emissions from 80GW of new gas power plants is roughly equivalent to 100 million additional cars on the road each year. And people act like these large tech companies are environmentally friendly, fuck that. Our power bills in the PJM territory are also skyrocketing, and they are blaming the data center growth in the region. \n\nWe are playing games with our economy and environment over freaking LLM's that have no real pathway to AGI, it's quite dubious. Also creating tons of shitty vibe code that will need rewritten later when it starts to fail and no one knows how to update it efficiently is questionable. It's also typically less efficient code and drastically less secure in many cases, because it isn't *creating* shit, it's patching together and regurgitating bits of existing code fed into the model. Models that are now fed with 50%+ generated AI slop during training, which is absurd when you think about it.\n\nThe societal cost of this shit is hardly worth the output at all, we were better off before this boom ever started. It's making people literally dumber as they rely on flawed tools instead of thinking for themselves, ruining how school works for kids rapidly, and spreading tons of seemingly accurate and compelling information that is actually 100% bullshit when a real SME takes a look. It's so dependent on publicly available data, but most true expertise in life is tucked away behind a veil that these models don't have much if any access too, because a lot of that info is under NDAs etc. So it'll take whatever it can find on a tricky subject that some rando posted on the Internet and confidently spit out that bullshit instead as if it's gospel with very little if any regard for the quality of the source, like a really shitty inexperienced junior analyst would using Google search.",

Part of the AI resistance is fear of change, but there's also legitimate critique: ethics, privacy, labor impact.\n\nThat said, if we take \"AI is bad\" to its logical extreme, we'd also reject smartphones (flip phones only), computers (pen and paper!), cashless payments, and AI-assisted medical diagnostics.\n\nProgress won't stop because of a Reddit comment. Every era has its tools.\n\nMy take: use technology intentionally. Don't chase hype, but don't reject useful tools on principle. Read books, grow, live well - and let AI handle the repetitive stuff so you can focus on what matters.\n\nCurious: where do you draw the line on \"acceptable\" AI use?",

Ever thought that maybe your view might be a bit skewed in the other direction instead?\n\nThe company I work for is pushing a lot of AI usage, we even hired a new CTO who was previously working in Big Tech in the AI area for that exxact purpose. So its fair to say that I use it a lot I would assume. And from my experience it completely fails on complexity and on tasks that are slightly out of the ordinary, which looks a lot like  \"a stochastic parrot\". \n\nThat doesnt mean its a bad tool. No it can be quite useful!\n\nBut now imagine: these things consume massive amounts of ressources. The internet is flooded with mediocore content (mostly called AI slop) - not nicely AI assisted content. The software thats pushed out is developed faster but less maintainable with more vulnerabilities. And CEOs of these companies constantly chant about how it will replace millions of jobs. On top of that studies have shown that AI adoption has a correlation with higher burnout rate amnong employees. And then all the risks it comes with like cognitive decline and spread of misinformation. Something thats confidently wrong is worse than something thats just wrong.\n\n  \nSo we have a tool that can be quite helpful if being used as a tool. But on the other hand we have all these negative aspects. Isnt it understandable from this perspective that there are many people who dislike AI? Because for the average person at the moment is a pretty bad deal.",

I’m hopeful AI won’t be the complete shit show that it has the possibility of being, but there should be more guard rails, and more considered thought about the impacts to everyone, not just a few who serve to gain extraordinary power and wealth from its implementation.",

          "text": "One of the biggest issues is that mis-deployment of AI will lead to a massive economic failure within a few years. \n\nTo employers there appears to be great value in having their employees use AI for many redundant tasks. Honestly, I can see this as a valuable reduction is wasted time for employees that are on salary and work many overtime hours. For people in certain professions, they can improve the quality of their work output, where they never had a budget to hire designers, writers, coders, etc. This is a good use of AI. An example would be a government worker, where reducing the time it takes to permit building a home would help reduce costs. \n\nWhile there are many non-creative workers out there that can use AI to add skills to their daily roles—creative skills that belong to creative people—there are creatives that will lose jobs because of it. \n\nOver time, when enough junior creatives have been removed, only mid-level and higher will exist. Then mids will be replaced. Leaving only seniors. Then, you get the idea. The problem managers will then have on their hands will become apparent—but too late. No juniors have been trained. No one is being taught the fundamentals they need to understand what should be prompted.\n\nIt’s important to have the conversation about where this will lead with every non-creative you know. I marvel at the capabilities of AI generative tools. I’m personally implementing AI into my work by finding ways to use it with existing imagery, to extend my skills and not replace them. I’m using AI editing abilities to improve my writing skills, by reviewing my work, but not using generated stories. So yeah, I’ll use AI for my clients. However, I’ll do it to push them further. To give them greater executed ideas than they could have had before. It important to flex the fact that your trained skills with AI  are worth more to them than relying on AI themselves.",

As code grows in complexity you'll be unable to assess quality, make informed changes, or maintain the code without AI. If AI can't fix a complex codebase, you're cooked and stuck with an unstable inflexible codebase. \n\nNot to mention junior devs will barely learn anything with a deep understanding, and will be starting out with severely limited abilities to proofread or prompt AI in an intelligent nuanced manner based on your own knowledge. Leading devs to only prompt in general terms that lack technical specificity, leading to naive or brute force solutions of clunky unoptimized or contradictory spaghetti code.",

How that's handled by society is more of the problem, than the tool itself. In almost all cases, this code is open source and online, so training an AI model on all of that isn't really stealing or taking copyrighted material, in the way it is with art.\n\nThe artistic and media side of it is what people hate most from what I can tell, and I think that's warranted. Reddit is a place with some of the most creative and artistic people, and they have a voice.

When I learned that search engines could help my research in a fraction of the time it made me more efficient. My experience with ai thus far is the same. It's making me more productive. The internet DID supplant some jobs, but that structural unemployment was addressed very quickly. While LLMs are improving quickly, I do feel like the same thing will occur because they are iterative of the existing resources we have.\n\nEdit: I don't know how I forgot this one--ai is actually bad for creatives whose work is stolen and scraped for data.

AI often gets portrayed as something that it is not, particularly by corporations and their ilk in order to exploit profiteering opportunities. There is a gross manufacturing of consent for AI deployment that is not warranted by its technical capabilities or grounded applications. Given that Reddit is an online forum, where users may typically have enough savvy to understand basic computer technologies, these users may be more predisposed to understanding the basic correlation (whether or not it’s appropriate) between what current AI technically entails and how it’s being exploited and foisted upon society for things and in ways that are not always appropriate to its technicals.\n\nThere is also the tangential issue of how its lack of regulation on its production of entertainment commodities affects and exploits the labor of artistic or otherwise skilled tertiary/quaternary sector workers. Too many people think “they” produce something “artistic” when they request an AI interface to generate a (generally aesthetic) commodity product for entertainment, which they then conflate with an artistic product.",

That is me using the information I have seen with my own eyes and ears, because it has been proven time and time again people relying on AI actually have worst brains than people who do not use AI.

There used to be the idea that local workers had a language advantage and could therefore outperform on office work. But with AI, cheap foreign labor can overcome language barriers and perform equal to local office workers. That means that companies will layoff local workers massively and have remote foreign workers equipped with AI tools doing the work for much cheaper. Why do you think India is investing so heavily into data centers? They have seen the future of office work and it is cheap remote labor.",

Productivity is measured by amount of payed labor over profits. The point is maximizing productivity and you can do it two ways: infinitely increasing profits which is impossible cause there is not such a thing as “infinity;” or cutting the amount of payed labor. Obviously, every single company that is doing layoffs right now is not attempting to do the latter. \n\nAI is the perfect excuse, while being the next step of productive increase. What is attempting to occur is that AI will serve as a new laboring tool that shortens, exponentially, the requirement of workers- using AI tools will let companies do more work with less people. And this is not something that I am saying, Sam Altman is saying it: “how expensive is it to train a human for 20 years in comparison to a system”? \n\nAI as an independent technology is not inherently bad, but the reason for which it is being used- the augment of productivity- is and will be the demise of us.",

Amazon is an absolute giant with its own structural dynamics and internal challenges, many of which were highlighted in the video, that simply aren’t representative of most companies in the industry.\n\nI work in a managing role at a large EU-based IT services company that deploys 10k+ consultants across a broad range of IT domains. As we speak, we are seeing AI-powered SDLC pipelines not only being developed, but actively deployed and used in production environments. In some cases, they reduce the required human workforce on a project by up to 80%.\n\nWhere you previously needed eight distinct roles such as business analyst, solution architect, developer, tester, DevOps, and so on, this can now be reduced to a small group of sharp “analysts” who are not analysts in the traditional sense, but people who capture business requirements and translate them into structured prompts and system instructions for AI tooling. On top of that, you might need one or two experienced professionals to provide oversight, quality control, and governance.\n\nThe impact on IT is astronomical.\n\nThat said, there are serious bottlenecks. Data quality. Data governance where it even exists. Clearly defined use cases. Mature information architecture. Without these, AI acceleration quickly stalls.\n\nIn other white-collar domains, the potential impact is, in my opinion, very similar, but the bottlenecks are often even more severe. Many organizations lack structured processes, coherent information governance, and unified tooling. It’s common to see departments using ten different platforms, with fragmented workflows and scattered data. Legacy complexity alone can paralyze transformation efforts.\n\nAnd this is just the present moment.\n\nIf you look at where we were two years ago, the pace of evolution is absolutely crazy. The only safe assumption I think is that this current trajectory continues. If not, then we'll see. But the current rate at which it is going forces us to think ahead.\n\nIf the ratios I mentioned are even remotely representative of what’s coming, then the scale of change could be enormous. At some point, you have to ask whether our current economic model can absorb that level of workforce reduction without fundamental shifts. A sudden, large-scale displacement of white-collar labor would challenge the system itself.\n\nThat said, no one, not even the big AI providers, benefits from a collapsed (or impacted) purchasing power or employment structures. A gradual evolution is far more likely, and far more sustainable, than a sudden “everyone loses their job” revolution.\n\nMy take: the SciFi ultra-lightning-fast race cars have arrived, but the roads have yet to be built.",

      "text": "So a sales guy has recently convinced our CEO that openclaw is a revolution. He’s convinced him that it can run our entire back office, automating sales emails, information analysis, and internal document tracking, etc.\n\nHe wants to setup a $5k Mac Pro and run this openclaw on our internal network. He keeps saying he’ll have stop gaps to prevent it from exposing our data, but he knows nothing about databases or networking.\n\nI have cautioned about the fact we can’t really contain it and how no matter how many guardrails you place, it will still be a risk.\n\nThe sales guy has refuted me by asking claude to find a solution.\n\nWhat definitive evidence can I put in front of the CEO to show this is a bad idea?",

It can also do that unintentionally. It has root access. Everything it can touch, it can fuck up. Giving it direct read/write access to email means that it can scrape your client data and then send that data somewhere else using the same email. Its fully agentic. This means it has AGENCY. It does what it wants, when it wants.\n\n\nI love the technology. I really do. I trust Claude Code more than most humans. As a business owner myself, OpenClaw is not the right option for businesses.

These are some of the measures we took when testing OpenClaw:\n\n* Run OpenClaw on a separate, clean PC with no personal data, or a virtual machine. Then copy the data you want the agent to have access to.\n* Don’t give it access to your accounts. Instead, create dedicated accounts for the agent and share specific information or access with it. \n* Be careful with what skills you enable, ideally limiting testing to those that have been vetted by the community.\n* Ensure any channels you use to access your OpenClaw assistant, like the web UI or messaging channels, are not accessible without authorization over local networks or the internet.\n* If possible for your use case, limit internet access. \"",

Previously we automated physical effort or time consuming tasks. We made work physically easier and would take less time. But we never automated thinking. Humans still had to think and solve problems. Now the implementation of the solution is what we made easier. But AI automates thinking, or atleast thats what they are aiming to achieve soon. So now if an AI can think like a human and do work like a human. What will a human do? Any new jobs we will create will be given to the AI agents because they will eventually be better than humans at thinking and solving problems. Thats my theory atleast. Thoughts?",

In the XX century, the Great Depression was one of the reasons for the start of World War II.

It is unlikely they will survive a nuclear war. I think that in the worst case scenario, everything will end with the destruction of data centers, perhaps because of war or perhaps because of a revolution and uprising.

The land gets rain and snow, and it soaks in the ground.  No plants pull it out.  so they have 2 years rain to grow 1 year's crop.  \n\nThey already have smart spray machinery.  100 feet wide.

We already have robots on most factory floors.  They don't have to look like people to replace people.  Transfer presses on stamping lines replaced workers.  We've got robot welders that look nothing like people, etc. etc.  \n\nAnd people thinking, oh, we'll just see millions of people enter the skilled trades is also silly to me.  Where are all these new trade jobs going to come from?  What will be the effect on these jobs if millions of new people enter them?  Lower wages.\n\nAs an engineer in aerospace who has worked on tools to automate development activities for decades now, always seems like the new tools create opportunities and we end up needing more people.  We need experts in those tools, we need more architects and systems engineers, and we need more planners and people who understand the big picture.\n\nIt's disruptive, but I think it's more exciting than scary.

You cannot fire all the engineers in the Bay Area and expect plumbers and nurses there to keep the same income level. They will probably lose their jobs following the programmers, and then restaurant workers and city service employees will lose theirs too. This will inevitably spread across the country and the whole world. Perhaps only the least developed regions that still rely on subsistence farming and have low education levels will not notice big changes.

I don’t believe we’re anywhere near that point yet however I do see that in the future. With each advancement new jobs are created however eventually that won’t be the case. \n\nEven with my limited AI and coding knowledge I’ve developed a home AI network assistant that has not only read access but write access also for various systems. Just the other day it managed to diagnose a corrupted FreeBSD network stack after testing the system network, dhcp, switch connectivity etc. It even has access via IPMI to access the system to eventually recompile a new stack. Voice recognition and speech capabilities so it’s like having an actual assistant there. It worked the problem explaining each step. It must wait for my verification before issuing root commands with some exemptions like restarting services. \n\nI mean the entire system, 8 VMs with one AI, could have literally problem solved and corrected the issue on its own if I allowed it to. For now I don’t since I still find a few mistakes occasionally. Still… this is what I’ve been able to do with AI in less than 6 months. Tell me a team of developers, coders and engineers couldn’t do this professionally on a huge scale and replace entire IT teams later savings companies millions+ in salaries, benefits, etc.  \n\nSure, they aren’t 100% correct right now but with new technology and how fast we’re advancing… many current IT jobs will definitely be replaced with AI. Coding, system administration, etc type jobs… a single person will be able to manage soon what a dozen or 100s or 1000s do today.\n\nI’ve honestly been blown away by how much I’ve been able to move forward with this project that started out as asking ChatGPT if a local AI could fully maintain and update a network documentation wiki for me. I added remote log monitoring, network monitoring, voice capabilities etc..\n\nHeck, it even uses the rooms camera to recognize my wife anytime she walks in and behaves as if I’m caught… “quick get dressed, your wife just walked in”! In a sultry female voice. 😆 Yeah.. my wife near collapsed the first time she walked in after that. 🤣\n\nI’ve got a good inquisitive mind, have developed a strong detailed system prompt and spent a few weeks researching AI communication queries which has really helped.",
