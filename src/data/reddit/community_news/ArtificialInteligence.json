They are disorganized, don’t follow up, have terrible customer service skills, look and act like people you wouldn’t want in your home, etc. \n\nIt takes very little time to learn a trade. Far less than most think given that 90% of most trades are the same work over and over again. Building codes and methods have largely been systematized. I have a buddy who is a constantly out-of-work electrician. He blames immigrants but when I ask him how it is that uneducated immigrants can do his job he says it’s because all their work has been dumbed down to the point that it’s like building Lego sets and pretty much anyone can do it. \n\nThe people who own and operate blue collar businesses are going to be in for a rude awakening once the white collar managerial class sees how easy most of the work in the trades is and begins starting these kinds of businesses. The older folks in the trades who’ve been allowed to be unprofessional for so long will be the first to go. They will be replaced by younger workers who will be trained differently and these companies will quickly surpass the more established companies with bad business habits. \n\nNow, don’t get me wrong. While 90% of blue collar work is “easy” there’s still a need for master level workers and those folks will still get coddled. But by and large the trades are going to see major disruption once the managerial class is forced to work in these fields.",

I have a mixed computer science and life sciences background, so although my focus today is in systems theory and ML/AI, over the years I also ended up learning how to grow human tissue in a lab environment, operate and troubleshoot mass spectrometers (and a handful of less complex machines) and build custom microfluidic setups, various bits of organic and inorganic chemistry, etc..

You can now watch a video on how to do that, which is way better than some boring no picture Chilton car repair book. Also, there's going to be new online tools where car repair shops will bid for your business.  And those online tools will be using AI to get the prices optimal for customers.  So yes accountants may not do electrical work in their house but there's a lot of other things they can do in their house.  And, most importantly Electrician students now can use AI to learn things more easily.  So even the pros will be using AI and that will mean more supply and when there's more labor supply prices tend to go down.\n\nCase in point. I'm changing my rear tail light this weekend.

Office jobs shrinking would definitely affect demand for things like renovations, new builds, and big purchases. When people feel uncertain, they stop spending. That part’s already visible in some sectors.\n\nWhere I’m less convinced is the idea that large numbers of office workers will successfully retrain into skilled trades fast enough to flood the market. Welding, electrical, HVAC, etc. still take time, certification, and real-world experience. You can’t just pivot in a few months and compete with someone who’s been doing it for 10 years.\n\nWhat I *do* think happens is pressure across the board: tighter budgets, more competition, more cost-cutting. Nobody is fully insulated. We see the same thing in our line of safety, manufacturing, and compliance inspection work. Even when tools get smarter, real-world constraints, regulations, and physical risk keep humans in the loop. So yeah, AI affects more than just “office jobs,” but the ripple effects are probably slower and messier than a sudden collapse.",

That's the problem it's untrained it takes five years of some form of apprenticeship to reach journeyman status in nonunion or union setting. Some states have lower standards, but in return any trade requiring licenses often have no reciprocity agreements. Meaning a Texas electrician or plumber or HVAC guy can't legally go to Washington and start doing their trade. States like Wisconsin require their plumbers and electricians (anything with a license really) to go through a pretty solid 5 year schooling program.\n\nSo it's not like these people will just magically be integrated into the trades and boom every market is saturated. Roofing, insulators, laborers, yeah they'll probably get saturated, but honestly those trades aren't really for the weak so not everyone is going to make it coming from an office job. Then Commercial construction isn't just stores, and restaurants it's hospitals, schools so yeah that might slow down but those never stop. There's also industrial which can go from warehouses to factories, to nuke plants etc etc again those may slow down, but they never stop. Just because residential would take a hit doesn't mean it would also affect the other aspects. There's infrastructure as well.",

Office workers aren’t going to transition en masse to manual labor jobs, the vast majority of them are far too old to make that kind of transition and that isn’t even counting how many of them are female.\n\nThe problem with trades compared to knowledge work is the vast majority of trades have very very explicit caps on how much labor that they actually need to do the work and once that number is hit then they just have too many people on the bench to potentially drive wages down. The risk isn’t transitions, it’s a massive amount of cheap young labor going into those fields at a young age and flooding in and creating over supply in most major metros. That will mean anyone who isn’t a business owner or entrenched in a union is shit out of luck.\n\nThis is still all irrelevant because every semi imperial number and survey we have still says that Americans overwhelmingly do not want to do trades or manual labor and it will probably take much bigger changes in the work force than AI has done yet to convince them otherwise.",

There's a reason most job applications call for 2-4 even 6 years of experience. Like you can have a technician work on Ford motors and Ford cars all his life. But the moment you bring let's say a Mercedes or a Honda in front of them. They don't know how to work on it (they were never a good tech. They were a part swapper) All the engines work fundamentally the same way, but let's say Honda for their VTEC uses hydraulic pressure with your oil and actually changes the camshaft rockers itself while in a BMW instead of changing the camshafts they use some kind of mechanism in between the lifters and the camshaft and has nothing to do with the rockers. They both fundamentally operate in the same way but they're completely different systems and it takes time to learn the difference. I'm not saying I'm the best tech because I can work on both motors. There's a lot of things I don't know but I will say there's a lot of things I do know and I'm sorry My diagnostic skills and my ability to talk to my customers will definitely keep me in business over someone who just got into the career, especially as a mechanic. You got to be good at explaining how something works to someone with no experience. That's not the fault of the consumer driver. Whatever it's the fault of the damn company that makes these complicated motors. They don't need to be this complicated. They got to have a certain thism to keep up with all the bull they be putting in it. And if you want to know the difference between Honda's VTEC and Mercedes advance valve control or whatever they call it, Honda uses the the camshaft rockers and the lobe stays the same except when you go above 5000 RPM or something. I can't remember exact your oil pump adds enough pressure to push a pin through the rockers. There's one set that's normal for a fuel efficiency and another set that opens both the intake and exhaust valves for more air and to flow better turning your little 4 before banger into a race 4 banger And BMW does the same thing except it's electronically controlled through an actuator. No hydraulic fluids and it has this weird Goofy system to mechanically change said rockers fundamentally the same but one's more reliable (Honda) and the other not so much. But if you ask a BMW dealership they'll say it's just normal wear and tear, 😭🫩",

When we finally started to see a real hosing recovery several years later, we had a persistent trades shortage because everyone felt burned only a few years prior. \n\nWe’re already not building a lot of residential housing. Commercial construction is overwhelmingly in data centers. Industrial construction starts have [nearly ground to a halt](https://zeihan.com/keep-an-eye-on-industrial-construction-spending/). \n\nIf data center construction slows, the calls to be an electrician will end overnight.",

I have a bit more respect for academics in this regard; they're aware of it—not all of them, but many more than blue-collar workers.\n\nAnd another fine example from our history. It will show once again that blue-collar workers will be left even more out in the cold, or rather, sitting pretty at the mercy of E.A.T.R. The carriage driver could simply be retrained as a taxi driver. Who will be favored for these retraining programs in the \"new jobs\" that AI creates? If there are even any jobs left at all. All our lives hang by a thread at the mercy of a select few in this world. Anyone who hasn't grasped the gravity of the situation is, in my opinion, either an NPC or deeply entrenched in their own existence.\n\nI'm curious to see how much weight the WEF and its participants will give to the issue of unemployment.

It's not the education needed behind the job you all are missing it's the physical tolerance on your body AND your intellect.  Yes, some things are routine. But there's a lot out there that isn't. And just like in tech there are things you're not going to learn from an online course but via experience. But the physical aspect of some jobs are extreme and I don't care how fit you are, there's a difference between work strong and gym strong. And there's a massive difference between moving your body 5-10 hours a week and doing it 40-60 hours a week physically speaking. \n\nSecond, automation will take over mundane trade skills that you can use on repeat. But the ability to fix broken things isn't something I see a robot being able to accomplish, even with AI, anytime soon. Repairs being the main one. Everything breaks at some point, but not everything is going to break the same way. Now, I can see people behind a robot getting the robot to fix something but not just the robot doing it autonomously.\n\nLastly, I'm really disappointed by these comments. The number of you that believe blue collar workers aren't smart enough or have the capacity to surpass you via intellect is pretty astounding.

Since they don’t seem worried, at all, then it leads me to believe that they must be lying, especially about their timeline. AI isn’t coming for the majority of white collar jobs anytime soon. \n\nBig obstacles are heading at the industry, as OP mentioned. Then there’s the fact that people are quickly becoming aware that having an AI server farm in your city is not something you want. The noise alone is unbearable and physically disabling, which makes your property worthless and your health compromised. I guess that’s great for the farm, because they can then buy your property at pennies on the dollar, in order to expand their farm. Rinse and repeat. \n\nCan’t forget about the water supply they need and, industry being what it is, the pollution and environmental impact that will happen. \n\nEnergy usage/supply is another obstacle when they raise prices for everyone else. \n\nHopefully solutions to these issues can be discovered because I appreciate AI, for the most part, because it’s free. If I had to pay for it, I would rarely use it. ",

          "text": "This thread is spicy for a reason, but it’s also mixing three very different things into one “OpenAI is doomed” narrative - tech limits, business math, and vibes. Let me poke at all three a bit.\n\nFirst, a lot of the numbers being thrown around might be directionally true but they’re being interpreted like OpenAI is a normal startup. It isn’t. This is closer to early AWS than WeWork. AWS lost money for years while Amazon lit cash on fire building infra no one else wanted to pay for yet. Same pattern here: OpenAI is front-loading the most expensive part of the curve (training + inference at scale) before enterprise pricing, regulation moats, and distribution fully kick in. That doesn’t mean it can’t fail - just that “losing $X per quarter” on its own isn’t a death sentence.\n\nSecond, the “Gemini is winning because it’s bundled” argument cuts both ways. Bundling wins short-term MAUs, not necessarily mindshare or platform gravity. Internet Explorer had the bundle. Chrome won the developers. Right now ChatGPT is still the verb. That matters more than Reddit wants to admit. If OpenAI turns that verb into workflows (agents, memory, internal tools, enterprise copilots), the revenue math changes fast. If they don’t, then yeah - BlackBerry comparisons start to feel earned.\n\nOn the exec exits: this is the strongest bearish signal IMO, but people are over-romanticizing it. Frontier labs are inherently unstable. The moment you shift from “pure research lab” to “global product + gov relationships + $10B infra decisions,” you will lose researchers who hate that world. That’s not automatically “rats fleeing,” it’s often “wrong personality for the phase.” The real red flag would be research stagnation plus talent drain plus declining usage. We don’t have all three yet.\n\nWhere I do agree with OP: scaling laws are getting ugly, and OpenAI is the most exposed because they set the pace. Being first means you pay the most tuition. Google can wait, copy, and amortize across Search, Ads, Android, and TPU. OpenAI doesn’t have that luxury. If on-device models reach “good enough” faster than expected, cloud-first players get squeezed hard.\n\nSo no, I don’t think this is an AI winter. The tech is too useful, and adoption is too real. But could OpenAI specifically end up being the company that proved it was possible, but not the one that captured the most value? Absolutely. History is full of those.\n\nThe real question isn’t “will OpenAI fail?”\nIt’s: will they become an infra layer, a product company, or an acquisition?\nBecause only one of those justifies the current narrative - and they’re running out of time to choose.",

          "text": "Honestly, I have trouble reading this as the “end of AI.” It sounds much more like the end of the illusion that everything would scale indefinitely without friction.\n\nWhat strikes me most isn’t the competition from Gemini or the benchmarks, but the gap between:\n\n• the almost mythological promise (imminent AGI, ever-improving models),\n\n• and the very industrial reality: costs, energy, infrastructure, diminishing returns.\n\nThe scaling laws that are reaching their limits are perhaps the real weak signal here. Not “AI no longer works,” but “AI is becoming a problem of heavy engineering and brutal business,” not a magic hack.\n\n\nRegarding OpenAI in particular, I get the impression they're paying the price for:\n\n• their leading position (everyone compares them, no one forgives them),\n\n• and a complicated transition from research to consumer product to cash cow.\n\nThe feedback about them being \"too robotic/corporate\" is also interesting: technically, they're progressing, but in terms of user experience, there might be stagnation, or even regression. And benchmarks don't capture that.\n\n\nSo for me:\n\n• not an AI winter in the 2010 sense,\n\n• but probably the end of the \"free money + hype + naive scaling\" phase.\n\nThe question I'm asking myself is:\n\nWill the next wave of innovation come from new giant models, or from more refined, more human, better integrated—but less spectacular—uses?\n\nCurious to know what you think will be the next real differentiator: raw performance, cost, or user experience?",

Another 30% from here.\n\nbut Everyone's asking why..!? The answer is almost embarrassing for the AI industry.\n\nChatGPT, Gemini and Claude all cite Reddit constantly. Like every third answer has \"according to discussions on Reddit\" or links to some thread from 2019 where a guy solved the exact problem you're asking about. There's also a meme going around. \"The biggest technological achievement of the 2020s is an AI that can find the Reddit comment a random person wrote in 2015.\" And it's kinda true :)\n\nWe spent $1 trillion building these models. Entire data centers. Billions of parameters. Cutting edge research. And the most valuable thing they do is point you to what some human already said.\n\nReddit didn't build any AI. They don't have a research lab. No PhD engineers working on transformers. They just have a website where people talk to each other. That's it.\n\nWhile Google spent $70 billion on AI and Microsoft spent $80 billion and Meta spent god knows how much. Reddit just kept the servers running and let people argue about whether the new iPhone is worth it.\n\nNow those billion dollar models need Reddit to sound credible.\n\nGoogle's paying Reddit $60 million a year for training data. OpenAI has a similar deal. Reddit made $1.3 billion in 2025 partly from these licensing agreements. Just from letting AI companies scrape conversations people had for free.\n\nthe funny thing is We built AI to replace humans. To automate knowledge work. To make human expertise obsolete. Turns out the most valuable thing in the AI era is authentic human conversation. The messy unfiltered stuff where someone who actually used the product tells you if it sucks or not.\n\nPerfect loop. Humans talk. AI learns. Humans visit to see what AI cited. Talk more. Repeat.",

The forum starts with a Summary of the topic, and then includes a \"ripple\".  a ripple is how the topic itself may interact with indirect subjects.  I then am using AI to parse aggregated news sources to develop and validate the ripples, and to cause automated polls to get created that validate the actual cause/effect relationship of the ripple.  the end game is a budgetary simulation environment that can take concepts and be able to try to determine outcomes that are not cleanly bridged.  this means that the AI usage though is very much constrained to specific functions, and does not simply function as the typical generative AI.  It has definitely been a wild ride trying to connect the dots.  Not sure if it is the right way to approach this, but it seems to be working so far.  Although I think i need some more beta testers at this point.",

The problem wasn’t having standards, it was how those standards were enforced—being “right” turned into being condescending.\n\nAI didn’t win because it’s perfect, it won because it’s patient and doesn’t make you feel dumb for asking. That’s more of a community and UX issue than a tech one.\n\nThere’s probably still a place for high-quality, human-curated answers—but only if helping people matters more than reputation points.",

After making no headway and getting responses like “Honestly, if you don’t know what {specific technical jargon} is, you shouldn’t even have a jellyfin server”, he gave up and tried ChatGPT and got his server upgraded in around 5 minutes. \n\nThis led the community to share their experiences about having to use AI in place of traditional older options like subreddits and stack overflow because those communities are just not helpful enough to justify dealing with the verbal abuse when you can go to ChatGPT and get the same answer in less time. ",

The issue is not that the tech is not available, but rather the cost to run it is far more than the revenue so why would you? You would only run at a loss if you believe that in the long run, people will be locked to your platform where you can then extract profit.  This is what USA tech is doing right now.  We use the USA tech as they have lured us with bargain basement prices at their loss.  It is a gamble that is impacting every day Americans who really are competing for resources with AI that a % of is serving other nations.  Maybe big tech and the American way is going to make the USA even more powerful, but the evidence surrounding AI would suggest the leverage to lock people to your platform does not exist as there is no moat.  I think when the dust settles on this era of AI, America will have owners themselves.  Might already have when they revoted in their tribal brained leader again.",

              "text": "Its mostly nimbys running on disinfo. Data centers do not use up much power\n\n>The Economist has adapted a model of state-level retail electricity prices from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to include data centres (see chart 2). We find no association between the increase in bills from 2019 to 2024 and data-centre additions. The state with the most new data centres, Virginia, saw bills rise by less than the model projected. The same went for Georgia. In fact, the model found that higher growth in electricity demand came alongside lower bills, reflecting the fact that a larger load lets a grid spread its fixed costs across more bill-payers. Still, problems may be coming. The clearest warning sign comes from pjm Interconnection, the largest grid operator in the country. Prices at auctions for future generation capacity there have soared, as data-centre growth has yanked up projected demand. That will hit households; pjm reckons the latest auction will lift bills by up to 5%.\n\n>In principle, data centres could lower power prices. As well as adding more load to spread costs over, if data-centre operators are able to learn to curtail demand when the grid is under most strain (either with algorithmic tweaks, or paying for on-site backup batteries or generators), they could help use the existing grid more efficiently. On October 23rd Chris Wright, the energy secretary, proposed a rule that would speed-up grid connections for curtailable data centres. The optimistic scenario, then, is that new demand from data centres pays for upgrades to America’s power infrastructure.\n\nhttps://archive.is/RXoJG\n\nThere’s a reason electricity prices are rising. And it’s not data centers. It’s not AI. It’s not even data centers. https://archive.is/6q4gv\n\nAccording to a recent published study from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, data centers seem to have reduced household electricity costs where they're built. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040619025000612\n\n>Contrary to these concerns, our analysis finds that state-level load growth in recent years (through 2024) has tended to reduce average retail electricity prices. Fig. 5 depicts this relationship for 2019–2024: states with the highest load growth experienced reductions in real prices, whereas states with contracting loads generally saw prices rise. Regression results confirm this relationship: the load-growth coefficient is among the most stable and statistically significant across model variants. In the 2019–2024 timeframe, the regression suggests that a 10 % increase in load was associated with a 0.6 (±0.1) cent/kWh reduction in prices, on average (note here and in all future references the ± refers to the cluster-robust standard error). \n\n>This finding aligns with the understanding that a primary driver of increased electricity-sector costs in recent years has been distribution and transmission expenditures—often devoted to refurbishment or replacement of existing infrastructure rather than to serve new loads (ETE, 2025, Pierpont, 2024, EIA, 2024a, Forrester et al., 2024). Spreading these fixed costs over more demand naturally exerts downward pressure on retail prices.\n\nThis study was peer reviewed and published in the Electricity Journal Volume 38, Issue 4, December 2025, 107516\n\nAI is not causing energy prices to increase https://andymasley.substack.com/p/data-centers-and-electricity-part\n\n>The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory concluded that data center activity has not contributed to changes in national average household electricity costs.\nElectricity prices rose (4.8% nominally per year from 2019–2023) primarily due to inflation and surging utility costs. The single biggest factor was the spike in natural gas prices caused by the Russia-Ukraine war, which drove up fuel and purchased power expenses.\nData center electricity demand has grown steadily and predictably, making it an unlikely cause for sudden price shocks. While US electricity demand is rising (with data centers accounting for ~40% of growth), it is growing slower than it did in the 20th century—a period when inflation-adjusted prices often fell despite high demand.\n>While Virginia residents saw bills rise by 28.1% alongside a massive data center buildout, most of that increase was inflation. Virginia’s electricity prices actually increased less than the national average.\nThere is no strong correlation between data center density and skyrocketing rates. States with few data centers (like Maine) saw the fastest rate hikes, while 11 of the 15 states with the most data center expansion saw lower-than-average rate increases.\nHigh total electricity usage does not permanently raise prices (e.g., urban vs. rural rates are similar). Price spikes occur when demand outpaces supply in the short term, but prices balance once supply catches up.\nWhile data centers are not the national driver of inflation, they have been cited by authorities in specific locations (Virginia, Arizona, Delaware, Oregon) as one of several factors contributing to localized cost increases, though the exact impact remains unclear.",

              "text": "They never were \n\n>The Economist has adapted a model of state-level retail electricity prices from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to include data centres (see chart 2). We find no association between the increase in bills from 2019 to 2024 and data-centre additions. The state with the most new data centres, Virginia, saw bills rise by less than the model projected. The same went for Georgia. In fact, the model found that higher growth in electricity demand came alongside lower bills, reflecting the fact that a larger load lets a grid spread its fixed costs across more bill-payers. Still, problems may be coming. The clearest warning sign comes from pjm Interconnection, the largest grid operator in the country. Prices at auctions for future generation capacity there have soared, as data-centre growth has yanked up projected demand. That will hit households; pjm reckons the latest auction will lift bills by up to 5%.\n\n>In principle, data centres could lower power prices. As well as adding more load to spread costs over, if data-centre operators are able to learn to curtail demand when the grid is under most strain (either with algorithmic tweaks, or paying for on-site backup batteries or generators), they could help use the existing grid more efficiently. On October 23rd Chris Wright, the energy secretary, proposed a rule that would speed-up grid connections for curtailable data centres. The optimistic scenario, then, is that new demand from data centres pays for upgrades to America’s power infrastructure.\n\nhttps://archive.is/RXoJG\n\nThere’s a reason electricity prices are rising. And it’s not data centers. It’s not AI. It’s not even data centers. https://archive.is/6q4gv\n\nAccording to a recent published study from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, data centers seem to have reduced household electricity costs where they're built. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040619025000612\n\n>Contrary to these concerns, our analysis finds that state-level load growth in recent years (through 2024) has tended to reduce average retail electricity prices. Fig. 5 depicts this relationship for 2019–2024: states with the highest load growth experienced reductions in real prices, whereas states with contracting loads generally saw prices rise. Regression results confirm this relationship: the load-growth coefficient is among the most stable and statistically significant across model variants. In the 2019–2024 timeframe, the regression suggests that a 10 % increase in load was associated with a 0.6 (±0.1) cent/kWh reduction in prices, on average (note here and in all future references the ± refers to the cluster-robust standard error). \n\n>This finding aligns with the understanding that a primary driver of increased electricity-sector costs in recent years has been distribution and transmission expenditures—often devoted to refurbishment or replacement of existing infrastructure rather than to serve new loads (ETE, 2025, Pierpont, 2024, EIA, 2024a, Forrester et al., 2024). Spreading these fixed costs over more demand naturally exerts downward pressure on retail prices.\n\nThis study was peer reviewed and published in the Electricity Journal Volume 38, Issue 4, December 2025, 107516\n\nAI is not causing energy prices to increase https://andymasley.substack.com/p/data-centers-and-electricity-part\n\n>The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory concluded that data center activity has not contributed to changes in national average household electricity costs.\nElectricity prices rose (4.8% nominally per year from 2019–2023) primarily due to inflation and surging utility costs. The single biggest factor was the spike in natural gas prices caused by the Russia-Ukraine war, which drove up fuel and purchased power expenses.\nData center electricity demand has grown steadily and predictably, making it an unlikely cause for sudden price shocks. While US electricity demand is rising (with data centers accounting for ~40% of growth), it is growing slower than it did in the 20th century—a period when inflation-adjusted prices often fell despite high demand.\n>While Virginia residents saw bills rise by 28.1% alongside a massive data center buildout, most of that increase was inflation. Virginia’s electricity prices actually increased less than the national average.\nThere is no strong correlation between data center density and skyrocketing rates. States with few data centers (like Maine) saw the fastest rate hikes, while 11 of the 15 states with the most data center expansion saw lower-than-average rate increases.\nHigh total electricity usage does not permanently raise prices (e.g., urban vs. rural rates are similar). Price spikes occur when demand outpaces supply in the short term, but prices balance once supply catches up.\nWhile data centers are not the national driver of inflation, they have been cited by authorities in specific locations (Virginia, Arizona, Delaware, Oregon) as one of several factors contributing to localized cost increases, though the exact impact remains unclear.",

This account is not labeled by AI, 121k people think this account is a real chick (I looked through the comments on a few posts and couldn’t find anyone saying this is AI) I strongly believe users should know if there content is AI or not, it’s also more common for younger people to notice AI better than older pepe and this account is directly targeting older men for that reason. \n\nAI content has flipped social media in a complete 180 and it’s genuinely scary to watch. AI users flood social media used for manipulation and monetization. AI slop is everywhere.\n\nThey need to start doing 1 of 2 things\n\nMake mandatory AI labeling, so people know if their content is legit or not, or ban it entirely which might be the better option. The internet is a wasteland once made to connect humans and share human moments and art has turned into fabricated people, art, moments, and to me ruining why social media and the internet was invented in the first place. \n\nIn the future I really hope to see more laws in place on this to make the internet what it once was. What do you think? Would you wanna see more laws in place or do you think i’m being dramatic? ",

People have been lying, scamming, and manipulating online forever; AI just makes it easier and more visible. To me the real issue is transparency and platform responsibility, not banning the tech altogether. If accounts were clearly labeled, people could make their own call, and the genuinely cool, creative uses of AI wouldn’t get drowned out by the creepy stuff. Every big tech shift goes through this awkward phase where the worst use cases show up first. I don’t think the internet is dead; it’s just changing faster than we’re used to, and we’re still catching up on rules and norms.",

It is not only an insult to society, it is illegal>, said Liz Kendall, the Secretary of State for Technology, in Parliament.\n\n=> [EuroNews](https://fr.euronews.com/next/2026/01/13/des-interdictions-aux-enquetes-quels-pays-visent-le-chatbot-ia-grok-delon-musk)\n\n*** Which countries have banned Grok? ***\n\n- Indonesia was the first country to temporarily block Grok in order to protect women and children.\n\n- Malaysia\nThe Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) ordered a temporary ban on Grok on Sunday after what it called \"repeated misuse\" of the tool to generate obscene, sexually explicit, and manipulated images without consent.\n\n=> [EuroNews](https://fr.euronews.com/next/2026/01/13/des-interdictions-aux-enquetes-quels-pays-visent-le-chatbot-ia-grok-delon-musk)\n\nFeel free to add any countries I've missed.\n\n\nNote: The premium on-demand undressing service is no longer available. Or almost. Elon Musk's social network announced Wednesday evening, January 14, measures to prevent the editing of images of real people in revealing outfits, such as bikinis, by the account of its artificial intelligence tool, Grok. This is a \"geographic\" block, not a global one; the restriction is limited to \"jurisdictions where it is illegal,\" X emphasized in a message posted late that day in the United States.\n\n=>[Libération](https://www.liberation.fr/economie/economie-numerique/x-restreint-partiellement-le-deshabillage-des-personnes-reelles-avec-grok-sous-la-pression-de-plusieurs-pays-20260115_ZCVPBKOECRE7HBDCLRZ4GRHUF4/)\nIf I've forgotten a country, please feel free to add it.",

      "text": "Alphabet recently moved ahead of Apple in overall valuation, but focusing on rankings misses the more important shift underneath.\n\nGoogle built much of the early neural network infrastructure, and the current wave of large models is playing directly to those strengths. What caught attention internally wasn’t a flagship product launch, but a research image model experiment that showed meaningfully lower inference latency than comparable systems, which in turn triggered broader organizational changes.\n\nDeepMind and Google Research were consolidated into what is now the Gemini engineering organization. Instead of fragmented research and product groups, model development, systems, and deployment started operating as a single pipeline.\n\nThe hardware layer is a large part of this story. Google’s latest TPU generation, Ironwood, moves to a 3nm process and higher-bandwidth memory, allowing much higher throughput per pod and noticeably better energy efficiency for large-scale training workloads compared to general-purpose accelerators.\n\nOn top of that stack, Gemini’s largest models are trained and served within the same vertically controlled environment, keeping training scale, inference latency, and cost tightly coupled. That kind of optimization is difficult to replicate without owning the entire pipeline.\n\nThis is where the structural advantage shows. Google controls custom silicon, global cloud infrastructure, and uniquely large real-world data streams from Search, YouTube, Maps, and Android, with distribution built into products people already use daily. That combination is hard for partnerships to fully reproduce.\n\nAs Gemini features roll into Google One, AI stops being a standalone tool and starts looking more like a default layer bundled into everyday digital life, shared across households rather than adopted one user at a time.The shift here isn’t speculative hype. It’s an infrastructure advantage gradually translating into long-term platform leverage.\n\nEdit: Been testing different AI platforms lately. The ones with full stack control perform noticeably better. X-Design is one example where solid infrastructure shows in output quality.\n\n",

But I think their AI is hampered by not being able to commit copyright violations on a massive scale like their competitors. Gemini loves to tell me \"no\" when anything even gets close to someone else's IP. Being paranoid about this sort of thing is one of the curses of being a large company.\n\nGoogle has been the company benefiting from pirating before...YouTube was successful (and purchased by Google) initially because it was the first place that had all sorts of instantly-delivered pirated content that was reliably accessible. It wasn't until Viacom's lawsuit that Content ID appeared...before then it was the wild west.\n\nAnyhow, all the AI stuff being shoved down our throats by Googlr, et al still hasn't provided a killer app to people that aren't computer programmers. Like a lot of programmer-derived anything aimed at the mass market, they see it as something obvious that everyone needs but don't realize it's not true because they don't have any friends that aren't programmers.\n\nIt's cryptocurrency all over again but with political and reality destabilizing effects that even the most diamond-handed crypto zealots could not have dreamed of. They've managed to reinvent art but for doing crime.\n\nP.S. It's funny that the telltale sign of \"OP used ChatGPT to write their post\" didn't show up until the end:\n\n> The shift here isn’t speculative hype.

If you think you're safe because you know things the AI can't possibly know, you don't understand AI at all and that means you WILL be replaced. \n\nIf you think AI is only beneficial to programmers you're living under a rock or haven't actually stepped outside in a very long time.

There will be mass unemployment.  All of our skills will be useless.  And they would say it with glee, almost. As if we, the people, would be so excited to be laid off, out of work, and fighting for survival. Me, and everyone I know that I have talked to about this has wondered: how detached from reality are they? They think people want to hear how obsolete people will become?\n\nNow, people are getting fed up with AI and the tech bros. They have shown their true colors, that they seem to hate humanity, for some reason. Or at the least just have a general disdain for all of us, because honestly, why else would people in positions of power and money keep happily talking about how we'll all be out work one day. They had this conference in Davos now stating how they're shifting towards a \"human-centered\" AI goal, but I think this was more of a publicity stunt to perform some measure of damage control. I'm not buying it. Just heard them for too many years bragging about putting everyone out of work. There is no way they are suddenly becoming kind and are concerned about the human workforce.\n\nAlso, on a lighter note, did they ever consider this: who will buy their products and services in this future they keep trying to sell where everyone is out of jobs and broke?",

Its no secret that OpenAI has pumped in billions of dollars into diversifying its portfolio and investing into what I recently read would not provide returns until the early 30's. Is the need to resort to ads then a consequence of Altman's hubris or a sign that the rat race has outpaced itself? Are we likely to see similar things across the board with Anthropic and Gemini (although it's hard to imagine Google running out of money)? Do you think the government would bail OpenAI out? And ultimately, is OpenAI having to turn to its \"last resort\" an optimistic turn, lessening competition pressure with a slower pace of development  and allowing Safety and AI Ethics to catch up?  \n",

These models are insanely expensive to run and train, and subscription revenue alone clearly isn't cutting it. Google's obviously fine since they print money with search ads, but yeah Anthropic might be sweating a bit\n\n  \nThe government bailing out OpenAI would be wild but honestly not impossible given how much political capital is tied up in \"AI leadership\"",

          "text": "1. They are offering ads on the free version. That seems fair to me.\n2. OpenAI is the closest competitor to Google ever created in terms of their tech capabilities. They have already started eating into Google’s market share. Why would you google something when ChatGPT can tell you the answer step-by-step. This is the perfect step to bust up the ad duopoly which has been scamming businesses since 1999. There are only two businesses that have made trillions of dollars with a 3% success rate (only 3% of ads convert IF you are GOOD.) I would rather see ads from ChatGPT than from Google and Facebook every day.\n3. That company would have the biggest IPO ever. Why do you think they need bailing out?\n\nThe AI bubble will burst for the companies who created ChatGPT wrapper apps and call it an AI platform. I saw something recently where they did a deep dive into startups for a fund and 70% of them who claimed to have AI were just using ChatGPT APIs. I have no idea on why funds never complete due diligence before giving ‘fake it til you make it’ guys millions of dollars after companies like Theranos spectacularly failed, but here we are.\n\nFor OpenAI specifically, Veo3 and RunwayML are winning over Sora for video. Midjourney and Nanobanana (what a stupid product name) are winning over Dali. Claude is a better writer and coder than ChatGPT (although both of them have competitive deep research platforms.)\n\nThat said- OpenAI is the most solid all-around platform so if you can only afford one subscription, they are the clear winner.\n\nThere is no AI winter coming for the major AI platforms unless companies like Nvidia stop selling to US based businesses. The only thing remaining is to continue improving the quality until you can’t tell if it’s real or AI (and that’s probably 2-3 years out), improve performance to optimize the hardware/electricity consumption, identify the price point for a sustainable business.\n\nBetween OpenAI and Anthropic- these two companies have created more innovation in the past 3 years than the past 20. Siri is a bust. Gemini is terrible and Google has a bloated mess on their hands.\n\nNow… let’s project into the future. The solutions are being built now to automate many info worker jobs in many industries. Those solutions haven’t gotten traction yet and aren’t hardened and the implementations aren’t foolproof. We have had support chatbots for over 10 years and IT teams do a terrible job of implementing them. Once the bots can train themselves and ask their human robot manager questions, the 50-80% of info worker jobs are gone. Customer service, accounts payable, sales, marketing. Instead of having 10 people on these teams m you will have 2 guiding and directing the AIs. This has already started happening in tech. Self driving vehicles are pretty close to maturity so boom….transportation industry is gone.\n\nNext up…the robot companies solve the problems of cost per unit, battery life and dexterity- add in an AI brain and boom 💥…the trades are gone.\n\n\nIf you think the AI winter is coming- you are not paying attention. Big brands like McDonalds would totally replace their teenage workforce with a robot and their franchise owners have the capital to invest once the technology is mature….probably 5-10 years out. A robot will always be a better employee than a human and will do exactly as programmed\n\nThe real AI winter is what do HUMANS do when they have no marketable skills, no savings, and new industries haven’t been created yet to create new jobs for the unemployed masses?",

I gave it the idea and then the two first short chapters, and a synopsis.\n\nWorking “together” we then wrote a highly satisfactory first draft in a day and a half. I estimate it will need one or two more brisk edits to be good enough for submission to publishers. Maybe a week in total?\n\nThis process would normally take 6-9 months. We are all screwed. ",

          "text": "Wow, feels like a bit of a synchronicity seeing this post now. I'm a software developer. I opened this sub (that Ive never really frequented) because before this I was getting lost in thought, thinking about how much the past ~4 years have changed things in my profession, and honestly lots of other things I do also, due to advances in AI. \n\nWhat got me down that mental rabbit hole was thinking about how things have changed in competitive chess play since Deep Blue's victory over Kasparov, and the later rise of chess analysis engines. Admittedly I'm a pretty casual observer and an extreme amateur at chess, so maybe my understanding isn't 100% accurate, but I like to think I know at least the broad strokes.\n\nDeep Blue's victory famously shook Kasparov, and to an extent the wider chess community pretty hard. I don't think it took long for the revolutionary nature of the moment to become obvious to anyone watching though. The game was no longer about beating the computer. In a way, it was no longer about being the best anymore. Everyone whose held the title of \"best\" in chess since has been able to claim that title without an asterix. \"Best *human player\". Sure, Chess is such a vast complex collection of states that even now it's far from being \"solved\", but since 1997 and increasingly since then, no human could hope to be in even the same league as a chess engine. \n\nI think it'd be easy to understand why someone, especially people who dedicated their lives to competitive Chess, might feel a bit depressed at that reality. I'm sure plenty did, plenty probably still do. But actually, I'd argue that the effect it had as a whole was to the contrary. Players at all levels learned pretty quick that the name of the game was now using the engines as a tool, and many have realized just how powerful the engines are in that regard. Rather than making chess at its highest levels look like a tedious exercise in memorizing \"correct\" sets of moves (Ironically, this was a criticism Grandmaster Bobby Fischer would have about the game before Deep Blue), it did more to make chess seem vibrant, alive, and inject creativity into the game. I'm sure a lot of people could speak a lot better than I could on these points, but my point is, In the age of AI dominance it seems like Chess is doing better than ever. \n\nThinking about that, it made me realize I feel like I'm seeing the same things happen in the world of software development. I wonder if I feel similarly to a Chess Grandmaster might have in the early 90s as the best engines became better than a higher and higher percent of players? I'm not sure if we've had our \"Deep Blue\" moment yet, but it doesn't feel like it's too far off for me. I think I see a lot of the same feelings I can imagine the chess community felt then among other developers, maybe even myself sometimes. \"What was the point of learning this skill/choosing this career if a computer was just gonna eventually take it?\" is a really common sentiment nowadays for those who can see the writing on the wall. But, I also don't think that does the best job capturing what's really written. \n\nChess engines better than the best grandmaster being free and publicly available doesn't make me better than Magnus Carlsen, and in the same way, it doesn't matter how far agents advance, it won't make a complete newcomer know how to build good, reliable, useful software. Carlsen is probably the best grandmaster who has ever lived, part of that might be who he is, I don't wanna diminish that because dude is a freak. But it's also true he wouldn't be at the level he is today, nor would anyone at the highest level of Chess, without having engines as an invaluable tool. \n\nI see similar things happening with software. Sure, slop vibe-code is everywhere, and that's probably gonna cause a lot of issues in the short term. But what you don't always hear about in the extreme pessimism and negativity pool that is modern social media, is the other side of that. The best, the people who were gonna build dope shit AI or not, the ones that are most effectively using the wealth of tools available to us now, are only doing more and more awesome things. \n\nWhat really struck me about your post was how similar your approach sounded to the one I take to development nowadays, and the approach of those who I look up to in my field. You mention \"working together\" with Claude. It doesn't sound like you're replacing your writing process, moreso that you are expediting it and (hopefully) enhancing it by a few factors. \n\nThat's the kind of mental rabbit hole that led me here. Like chess, like the way I can see programming going, I imagine as AI becomes something that can be realistically applied to more and more domains, we'll see this process happen again and again. Not exactly the same, but it'll rhyme. Art was one of the first things that I think got the public thinking about AI, as it became image generation was something on the horizon. And now that it's mostly here, why can we still pick out what images are \"slop\" so easily? Part of that is errors or AI idiosyncrasies, but those are less and less by the day and I don't really think that's the whole reason. It's the same reason I've been talking about, at the end of the day you need an \"artist\" to make art. \n\nI get a lot of this might sound overly optimistic, it's a real issue that more and more people are gonna have trouble finding work. Not to mention the very clear negative externalities AI is putting on us, this is long enough I don't need to get those here. I DO understand why you also said \"we are doomed\" even if it was tongue in cheek. But I think it's worth mentioning still, I do have a fundamentally positive outlook on what continued AI advancement is gonna do for society. I feel naive saying that. Maybe I'm wrong? \n\nI think really the question to be answered is whether the good that clearly exists as a result of this, can outpace the bad that also very clearly exists. That's something we have agency to answer I think, and to that I'm gonna keep learning how I can best use the absolute boon of resources available to me to be a better software developer than I ever would have been otherwise. I hope your experiment here allows you to do the same, maybe you'll be able to reach a higher level of writing than you thought possible, positively impact a lot of people's lives that way. Idk if you'll be able to post it anywhere here or if I'll ever read it(if you want to, I would be interested btw lol). Or maybe this experiment won't work out as good as you thought, and neither of us know what we're talking about. Maybe 4 more years from now, things will change even more drastically and we'll be amazed it was even a question.\n\nAnyway that's where my head is at haha, I wish you the best with the new book. I'm pulling for you to prove some of the haters here wrong, and hopefully not put more \"slop\" in the world. Good luck!",

          "text": "People are doubting me. Fair enough.\n\nSomeone asked me to produce a random chapter of another non-existent book as evidence. So. I just fed Claude a prompt, an idea for a completely new novel, asked for a style, and gave it some extra context and direction. Here’s what it gave me after 5 minutes \n\n\n\n\nThe Salt Library\n\nChapter One\n\nThe letter arrived on a Thursday, which was the day my sister used to say the world held its breath. I don't know where she got that idea—perhaps from our grandmother, who collected silly superstitions the way other women collected teacups. Thursdays were for waiting, she'd say. Fridays were for knowing.\nI found it wedged between a gas bill and a charity appeal, her handwriting unmistakable even after three years of silence. The envelope smelled faintly of woodsmoke and something sharper—eucalyptus, maybe, or the particular vegetal tang of high places.\n\nDear Eliza,\nDo you remember the salt library? I found another one. Bigger. Older. The walls here remember everything.\nCome if you can. But hurry.\n— V\n\nThat was all. No return address, only a postmark I couldn't quite read. Something ending in \"-cachi.\" Peru, perhaps. Vera always did love the edges of maps, those places where the cartographer's confidence began to fray.\n\nI teach restoration at the Slade now—the patient work of bringing damaged paintings back from the dead. My students think it's boring until they understand: every crack tells a story, every flake of pigment that lifts away is a small catastrophe of chemistry and time. I have learned to read disasters in their aftermath.\nPerhaps that's why Vera's letter unsettled me so deeply. I am trained to recognise damage, and her words carried the particular weight of something already broken.\nThe salt library. I hadn't thought about it in years.\nWe'd found it by accident, the summer I turned twelve and Vera fourteen—in Cornwall, during one of Mother's \"restorative\" holidays, which meant cheap cottages and long walks while she nursed her third divorce with gin. The library was carved into the cliffs below Tintagel, accessible only at certain tides through a crack in the rock face that seemed far too narrow until suddenly it wasn't.\nInside: shelves cut directly into the salt-white stone, filled with objects left by generations of visitors. A compass with a cracked face. Smoothed glass in every colour. Letters folded into origami birds. A child's shoe, perfectly preserved by the mineral air. Someone had started it—who knows when—and others had continued, adding their own small offerings to the darkness.\nVera wept when she saw it. I didn't understand why until years later, when I began to grasp how some people feel the weight of accumulated time more heavily than others. For her, that cave was unbearable proof that the world had existed before us and would go on existing after, indifferent to our particular sorrows.\n\"We have to add something,\" she said, her torch beam wavering across the shelves.\nI gave her my hair ribbon—green, with small white flowers. She folded a page from her sketchbook: a drawing of our mother's face, though she'd never show Mother that.\nWe sealed them in a jam jar and placed them on a high shelf, near the back, where the salt crystals grew thick as frost.\n\nMy flat in Bloomsbury is small and deliberate—books organised by spine colour (a habit Vera once called \"aesthetically correct but intellectually criminal\"), dried flowers in specimen jars, a single armchair positioned to catch the morning light. I've made a life of careful choices, of measured gestures. The opposite of Vera, who moved through the world like weather, sudden and impossible to predict.\nShe left London three years ago with nothing but a rucksack and a name I didn't recognise—some researcher she'd met at a conference, studying glacial cores in the Andes. The name was Miguel or Marco or something appropriately Peruvian, and Vera spoke of him the way she used to speak of undiscovered places: with a hunger that frightened me.\n\"He says the glaciers hold memory,\" she told me, the night before she flew. \"Thousands of years of atmosphere, trapped in bubbles. Every volcanic eruption. Every forest fire. You can read it, Eliza, like a book.\"\n\"That sounds like your kind of library,\" I said, meaning it as a joke.\nShe looked at me then with an expression I still can't name. Gratitude, maybe. Or warning.\n\"The ice is melting,\" she said. \"We're running out of pages.\"\n\n\nClaude then went on for another 1000 words and finished the chapter.",

Waiting for what? The weekend, and a day off from reading AI slop? Fridays are for knowing what, that you're a bad writer? The point of a metaphor is to bring forth a mental image. This brings forth nothing but confusion. \n\n>I teach restoration at the Slade now—the patient work of bringing damaged paintings back from the dead. My students think it's boring until they understand: every crack tells a story, every flake of pigment that lifts away is a small catastrophe of chemistry and time. I have learned to read disasters in their aftermath. \n\nWhat disasters does the authour encounter and \"read\" in the aftermath of art restoration? Surely the point of art restoration is to take a disaster and reconstruct something? Art restoration leading to disaster is actually a good metaphor for this writing.\n\nIf this is the best AI has to offer, even the writers of *The Daily Mail* are safe. Dear lord.",

The problem with AI is it has a \"way\" that it writes, and it writes that way all the time, even when you explicitly prompt it not to. It's very similar to how AI images have this uncanny signature that is hard to put your finger on but you know it when you see it, but \" who collected silly superstitions the way other women collected teacups.\" is exactly how AI writes all the time. It over-writes, over-elaborates and writes almost exclusively with cliches because that is what's in it's training data. The writing lacks the authority of a human author, and so it will very likely never meaningfully capture readers. From what I've seen, rather than improving, AI's havie actually only gotten worse in this regard over time. Trying to rewrite this slop to take the AI voice out of it would likely end up being significantly more work than just writing a novel yourself in your own voice. AI output also becomes increasingly incoherent over time. People will learn what signatures identify AI slop and will end up  specifically looking for works that go against those tendencies.\n\nThe best way to use AI for writing is the same way you would use google, as a research assistant, for brainstorming or to check for grammar and syntax. This alone should supercharge the writing process compared to what has been possible in the past. Trying to pump out AI slop in this way is a waste of your own time (and potentially money, if you subscribe to these programs)",

Even if good writing becomes ubiquitous due to AI, there will always be a “best, most recommended, most discussed” book/entertainment that wins the monoculture audience’s attention. So I think the traditional book game may stay the same? \n\nNow with so many novels published, the challenge falls to the book-reviewers to help readers pick their next book or reading journey. I could see individual readers develop a personal LLM that reviews a produced novel with specific insights into their preferences and how they might like or dislike a book. \n\nPerhaps the new competition is finding a way to enhance the reader’s experience in some novel way. And each reader may be different. Some folks will want a canonized “great book” that is produced, recommended, blessed, and book-club-discussed. Maybe the medium evolves into some sort of choose-your-own-adventure flavor that plays with the audience a little more (but loses a bit of canonization). Or books become more like interactive text based games where the author has baked a world into an LLM style interface and plays actively with the reader. If the brains of great authors are going to be so enhanced in terms of volume output, no reason to think this isn’t possible despite becoming a massive tome in total content (produced swiftly and easily with Claude). But “a book” would lose a bit of the canonization (I’m not sure how to put it). Thoughts? \nAlso tagging /u/superredhat",

It kinda kept the style i requested but lost all the beats. Like when you ask it to tell a unique joke,  you get the worst unfunny tries back. It never did dialouge voluntairily. It never transitioned well. It never ask followup that would clarify something for it if it could just skip it.\n\nIf you ask it to write as Terry Prachett, an mainly comedic writer from the last century, you don't get any jokes. You just get brisk standard english. If you ask it to write as Chuck Palahniuk (of Fight Club fame) on the other hand, you get a lot of swearing and the short hard style.\n\nAnyway, my story was a fantasy story and had part where the group would go on adventures, five of them. Three of the five adventures were \"they go to location, they are presented with a riddle in the form of a wise man asking them an actual riddle, a stone statue of a wise man comes to life and talk to the protaganist, he realizes selftruth (never specified)\". Never mentioned that as an example or anything, just straight up wrote three of the chapters pretty much identically. Never made a new location like an cavesystem or underground maze, it always went to what seems to be a glen in each case outside the location. Not much details about what anything looked like.\n\nI didn't notice at first because I had asked for 10 chapters and then to make each chapter into 3, and just gave it 30 prompts that I saved, I was hoping to read a cohesive book after all the prompts were done. That was after 2 worse earlier tries. I was mainly trying to get it to write longer, and it did, 2.5 pages about so 7-8 pages per original 10 chapters.\n\nWhat I lacked most of all was that it never made up a magical forest, or a glen in the forest they were, or a flower in the glen they were, or a breeze when they smelled a flower. It is the most stunted writer I can imagine.\n\nWhat it did do good was dividing an idea it came up with into chapters, and changing the list of chapters somwhat intelligently (in a way that required alot of handholding) when I asked for changes. I think AI is much better at planning writing than actually writing.",

If yes then nothing a LLM produces counts as creative writing, because it didn't mean anything by it. If no then we're in the world of the post-structuralists who said there is only text. There is no \"author\" only the \"scriptor\" who combines bits of previous texts. In which case \"expressing myself\" ceases to be a reason to write. \n\nSo, why write? All the remaining justifications are practical -- writing to sell books the audience wants, writing to get investors, writing to win the case. All writing becomes action plans and memos and other business-school bullshit, IOW. And AI will be better at that. So either we refuse the \"it's all text\" theory or writers are screwed indeed.",

Just that there's a formula for some books, like romance, and LLMs are really good at repeating common formulas. You might just be really good at leveraging that formula. And that's fine, a lot of popular works are derivative. \n\n\nYou'll run into an interesting problem if you get you good at using LLMs. No one will believe you cranked out a great novel in 3 weeks, over and over again. If you try to release that often you'll be assumed to be a fraud, somehow. Ghostwriter or LLM, same same. I wondered what the acceptable minimum interval between releasing new books could be before you would come under scrutiny.\n\n\nBest of luck. Please update the thread with hope your novel goes. ",

What I find so intriguing about collaborating with Claude, though, is that it's much like engaging with a human. Before our conversations even begin, I'll discover characters and tales within myself I never imagined imagining. \n\nMy latest novel concept spans 1812 Prague to 2100 Silicon Valley. Claude and I have developed a 181-page outline for it that is likely to be 200 pages when completed. We've also intricately outlined my eight-realm children's fantasy novel as well as its eight-portal sequel, for which another language model helped me imagine and develop several new languages. Those outlines are over 200 pages in length. 100% of their plot and character content is of my conception.\n\nThe issue then becomes, am I a good enough writer, and do I have the attention span to then write these books myself? I am a writer of what I deem to be quite gorgeous poetry, but I have no prior experience as a novelist. \n\nI did have Claude complete a draft of my eight-realm children's novel as I was curious to see what the result would be. Claude did a wonderful job with its draft. But to truly honor the story for the purpose of publication, I feel I should write it myself. \n\nIn some ways, it's horribly disheartening to develop these richly compelling stories, yet then lack the persistence and possibly the skill to actually write them. What is incredibly valuable, though, is Claude's canvas feature and its expertise in developing meticulous outlines/\"story bibles.\" I plan to save all of the work to a thumb drive in hopes that, should I fail to bring these books to life, a better novelist than I may one day wish to do so.",

Why do we pretend it’s ever been anything more than small twists on an amalgamation of the ideas we’ve absorbed over a lifetime?\nAnd why the fatalism? Why are we “cooked”? Why not just make better, more interesting art?\nIf someone can write that fast, why not do something genuinely ambitious with it? Why not try to build the best choose-your-own-adventure novel ever written? Until now, that kind of project was prohibitively time-consuming, nearly impossible to track, and structurally fragile. Those constraints are largely gone.\nHonestly, treating AI as a shortcut to crank out the same linear stories faster feels like one of the least creative ways to use what is effectively a new kind of brush.",

It would have taken me months to learn the 3D software required to do it justice.\n\nThe learning process does more than teach technical skills. It teaches you many other related aspects that make you better at your craft as a whole. People learning 3D modeling aren’t just learning Blender, they’re learning how motion works and conveys meaning, how lighting influences a scene, and how to combine disparate elements into a composition. Skipping the learning also skips a lot of those little progressions in your ability. \n\n>Honestly, I didn't feel like I \"lost\" the art.\n\nYou’d really have no idea because you never actually learned anything. As someone who hasn’t gone to med school, me saying, “med school isn’t important for doctors” is pretty meaningless. \n\n>I felt like a director rather than a painter. I still had to refine the script and tweak specific scenes using the supplementary prompt files it generated, but the heavy lifting was gone.\n\nThis is important. You’re not describing making art. You’re not even meaningfully describing a director. You’re describing the job of a producer or executive. You’re just giving top level notes to the actual producers of the art. \n\n>It really is just like photography. You don't paint the landscape pixel by pixel, but you still choose the frame, the lighting, and the subject.\n\nExcept you don’t. AI does. You just give notes to what AI produces. You can’t possibly compare that to an animator or filmmaker obsessing about every detail. This is much closer to A/B testing than it is to art. \n\n>The tool just changes where the effort goes.\n\nAnd where the effort goes makes a difference. A craftsman from the 1700s building a handcrafted plaster wall with intricate iron & wood flourishes and accents could be described as an artist. A construction worker pouring concrete in an office building probably wouldn’t be. I’m not saying the construction worker has an *easier* or *less important* job, but that where effort goes is extremely important in judging art.",

After all it literally takes everything it puts on the piece from the work of others (I am not even talking about copyrights issues).\n\nSo, here comes the problem of effort. It takes very low effort to take a picture but it takes a lot of effort to become a good photographer. The effort is in the learning, and the constant practice, and it is this process that creates your style. \n\nI understand that you may practice a lot as an \"AI director\", however I believe you are constrained by decisions made by the machine that you are unware of. One may think of oneself as a director when they ask AI to write a blog post, feeding it some topics, but in the end we know it just produces generic writing, generic structures etc (AI slop). \n\nProblem is today we are not creating a lot of art, but a lot of \"content\".",

Biggest problem right now is posting AI stuff and pretending it's a photography, or digital painting you made etc. To keep the photography vs painting analogy - if someone showed me pretty much the same picture, but one of them was just a photo taken with a phone camera of, let's say, my backyard and the other one was someone's actual painting of my backyard but so real it looked like photography, I would certainly have no admiration of the first but was amazed by the second. The creator of the phone photo would earn little to no respect, while the creator of the painting would deserve all the praise I could offer. Even if the end result pics looked pretty much the same.\n\nRight now, if I look at a picture of amazing sunset over a mountain set and I know it's real photography - I know the creator went though all the effort of planning the journey, timing it, had to plan around the lighting condition they found on site, use their knowledge to select and set proper equipment, set the frame then postprocess the pic to enhance end result. It's a long adventure that part of me is jealous of and the other part admires due to the whole picture making process. If someone showed me pretty much same quality picture but it would be just something out of a prompt, I have no respect for that picture. It may be pretty on the surface, but does not carry the creator process weight that is as important for assessment as the end result. For me at least. Knowing what the creator had to do for that art to be made is quite important for valuation, and if all they did was spamming prompts to PC until they liked the result then I am not impressed.\n\nOf course, that may not matter for utility pictures, simple advertisement etc. Ordering parties will be thrilled about artist margins going down or even off the table, even though they weren't really that great so far. And let's be real, they won't hire \"prompt artists\" for these, they will be mostly just made with lowest effort possible.",

To them, art was defined by “aurality,” or the quality of being one unique thing, and they really had to grapple with the idea of a piece of art being reproduced many times. Did it still have value as art? Was there some quantifiable diminished value the more something was reproduced? Say, 1/n where n is the number of reproductions?\n\nBut society absorbs it and moves on. They would be aghast at the idea that we could just create some art on a computer and then transmit it to every other computer screen in the world. Yet, today, we are entirely comfortable saying digital art has value as art.\n\nAnd that’s just one example. So it will be again. This stuff is like an arms race between technology and its cultural absorption, and it will never end.

Just go look at sci-fi book covers: Back in [1980 and before you had beautiful illustrations](/r/CoolSciFiCovers/). In the 1990 people toyed around with [early CGI](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1650813084i/207410.jpg). And around 2000 everything started being a [lazy stock image Photoshop](/r/badscificovers/comments/1o5vvij/starwater_strains_by_gene_wolfe/).\nEven the less than stellar examples of [old covers](/r/badscificovers/), while a bit wonky, still managed to look interesting, something I can't say about the vast majority of modern covers, which seem to be optimized for being fast&cheap, not for looking good.\n\nSame with many other areas, e.g. animation like Ghost in the Shell, Akira and Co. were the peak of animation and that just no longer exist, since everything went CGI or no longer spends the time and money to get to that level of quality. \n\nAll that said, I am not arguing against AI here, quite the opposite, AI is the best chance of reviving that level of quality. [Star Wars fan movies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4t3eKmOcVM) already looks better than what Disney managed to produce with a $600 million budget in [Rise of Skywalker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJrd6cyN8rw). It's not quite perfect yet, but the remaining issues will disappear in the not so distant future. The ease and flexibility of creation is just on another level with AI.\n\nThe biggest thing to worry about is that it will be too easy. We value things for their novelty and their rarity, and with AI that goes away, as it can just clone everything with a few clicks. The shared experience of going to the movie might disappear when everybody just watches random AI movies that are generated on the fly, without even a creator behind them.",

I thought it was a model issue, so I kept adding negative prompts like \"bad anatomy\" or piling on buzzwords like \"unreal engine 5, 8k, ultra detailed.\"\n\nI stumbled upon this breakdown today that actually explains the logic behind the plastic look, and it completely changed my workflow.\n\nThe gist is: Models are trained on photography captions. When you use generic buzzwords, the AI defaults to a flat, wide-angle \"smartphone\" look (infinite depth of field = fake looking).\n\nI started testing what the article suggested--swapping \"hyper-realistic\" for actual camera physics (e.g., \"shot on 85mm, f/1.8 aperture\"). The difference in skin texture and lighting is night and day. It stops trying to \"render\" the image and starts \"photographing\" it.\n\nThere’s a decent lens cheat sheet in here if you want to test the physics yourself.

Third, AI will significantly reduce Onlyfans traffic as many may want to just hang out with some sexy time. And that doesn’t even touch on AI GFEs - a HUGE, almost non-existent market today.\n\nPorn is already 100% fantasy, so I don’t think people will be nearly as hung up on is it human or not as long as it *LOOKS* real enough.
