CoPilot isn't even using LLMs or whatever to convert this data, it's just queuing it through Power Query by acting as an agent. Which is A) way less efficient than a batch file B) way more expensive C) way more prone to errors.\n\n\nSo the OP managed to solve an already solved problem in the least efficient way possible.

              "text": "I do not want to be rude - but personally, it seems that people using frontier LLM’s are able to confuse *their own* limitations with the systems limitations.\n\nI played around for years with it (as a SWE biding my time) and when it became difficult to poke the traditional holes, paid for a pro plan and as a test just saw how much of my job I could automate. Well, it did it all, and more. I now only interact with it when a new model is released and see how much more capable it is, then close it.\n\nMy experience:\n\n- 2022, fun stories. My first prompt was about my dog and Tiger Woods hanging out. GPT crafts a silly story about them winning the ‘golden putter’ or something. I was horrified. Stress tested via knowledge I know to be true. It was kinda like talking to someone who just woke up from a 5 year coma. Kinda makes sense, suggestions kinda out of date. \n\n- 2023, idk whether it was model progress or user progress but, “search engine with context.” Example: “I need to build a service that does ____. Where do I start?” and research documentation from there.\n\n- 2024, impressive capability with code blocks. I’m able to get a template function that does X and remove their variables and substitute my own. Maybe 50% of the time it’s worth it.\n\n- 2025, its templating things like json for me when I say “I need .json for this static thing. Set up the template for me with these fields, and any relevant fields I may need.” At *some* point, I realized it truly was only fucking up when I changed something and forgot to make it aware of the changes. Vomit, despair - “Prompt Engineering” started saving me time.\n\n- January 2026, it’s unbelievable. Unrecognizable. People who say “I’m an SWE, it’s nothing don’t worry” start to look like malicious liars with *really full pockets* to me, more than the terrified guys at the top saying “this could replace you.” When I stress test it via personal insight, I see no errors or flaws to a deep degree. I isolate a CLI agent in docker on a separate machine than anything I’m using. In 5 hours, I set up a system where I receive a survey from GPT, I answer it, and it generates an app based on my responses it thinks I need. Zero bugs. Works out of the box. Apps weren’t great at first, but over time they have gotten more and more refined. I do not use the apps, I am just watching how this little system I have set up evolves. I say “make it prettier” and it does, with no extra guidance. I am humbled, terrified.\n\nNow, I look at the layoffs and wonder, is this it? Are we seeing it? No one is coming to save them. Certainly not the free market, and this is a big shakeup. I look at other countries and AI. I look at the fact that open source models exist - it cannot be stamped out. When one country is able to automate and keep people happy - oh boy. I do not know what will happen. If there were adults in the room, it’d be fine. No, it’s not a new technology. But its capabilities as it relates to the public are new. If the tech has plateaued or plateaus soon, it could already revolutionize everything.\n\nSo when you say “it’s hype man,” I’m curious. Are you naive and lying, or am I? Are you able to genuinely consider the same question? If nothing I wrote sounds implausible to you and you still say “it’s hype,” then I am relieved because clearly there are MUCH more capable and intelligent people on top of this than me, the lowly worker who needs to skill up.",

To answer this question, I took the best models from ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini and ran them through CS 2112 at Cornell University, the hardest first semester CS class offered. Over the course of the semester, I pushed through broken AI products, absurd claims, and hallucinated garbage as I graded every single output against the same rubric we use against students to see if these PhD level experts can match up against a first semester freshman.\"\n\nIt was created and filmed over the course of the Fall 2025 semester at Cornell University.

No I don't mean one that needed constant handholding and prompting and revision by an engineer. I mean a legitimate working application that it built from zero. I would genuinely love to see and use it.\n\nAdditionally, a step further, what kind of applications are we talking about here? Are we talking about the most commonly produced CRUD apps out there that every new grad can copy via instructions? Because it just doesn't seem impressive that a copy machine can make copies. Can it actually build something useful on its own? Can it make decisions that actually make sense so that impact is actually delivered in the real world? Can it contextualize the real world at all? \n\nAs far as I can see, AI is extremely good at looking the part. But when it matters, the facade falls away. \n\nAlso, if I wrong, which I very well could be, where is the evidence? I don't mean jobs data (lots of factors involved) I'm talking about the explosion in USEFUL software (not just an increase in git commits). If what you say is true, we should be seeing incredible leaps. Deepseek should be making cheaper to train, more widely available deepseeks, AI should be propelling itself so rapidly that SaaS should be dead. Every industry in the world should be easily showing and proving how AI is making a massive positive impact.\n\nInstead what I see is silicon valley CEOs doing everything in their power to convince people they need these tools and a slice of the engineering population being convinced simply because it can spit out functional code. \n\nA final question, why would a product so useful it can replace the human workforce, not even be able to sell itself to the public on its use case? This should be the hottest commodity on earth but instead these companies are resorting to ADS to desperately reconcile their gaping profitability problem. You think one of these things could give their CEO overlords some ideas about drumming up revenue some time soon?",

Relational database systems have been around for over 50 years, yet how many companies have stored tabular information in collections of Excel files saved on network shares up until recently, if not today?\n\nWhen the modern smartphone came about (which is now so powerful that it can literally encode 4K video and run local AI models), it changed things considerably, but maybe not as extremely as first predicted. \"There's an app for that\" was the slogan, suggesting that for every last niche need, there would be a tailor-made app. While that is true to some extent, I'd argue that a lot of people mainly use their phones for staples. Mail, news, calendar, authenticator apps, messaging, photos, the works. Conversely, looking at niche apps, it's sometimes still quite challenging to find one that isn't shoddy or cavalier with privacy.\n\nThe staples weren't first made possible with iPhone-style smartphones, they were already feasible on the older-fashioned smartphones (well, app-based TFA wasn't around at that time AFAIK) and before that, a lot were covered by PDAs (even navigation) which were designed to be sat in a cradle and sync all new data to your device so you'd then have it available on the go, even without an internet connection.\n\nTechnological capability alone is never the only and sometimes far from the most important driver. All the way back in the 1860s, the first facsimile machine was commercialized that allowed to transmit not just beeps but actual b/w images over telegraph lines. The American civil war was still ongoing at the time, so quite a mind-boggling achievement. But interest was limited due to a number of factors and it wouldn't be until the 1920s that wiring photos became commonplace.",

OpenAI and all these other companies know that AI is largely useless, which is why instead of letting users choose AI, they’re forcing it into spaces no one asked for, in many cases detrimental to the user experience. The chickens have come home to roost, and they need to justify the billions of investor dollars they spent.

Very time consuming projects that couldn't be rationalized from a resource perspective become possible but also we won't need as many humans doing basic shit.\n\nHuge, huge problem is that the average Joe has no idea how fast this is actually happening.  In my industry I'm seeing it happen, it being the elimination of jobs, inside the next 12-18 months.  This isn't speculation, it's reality.\n\nIf and when we get to the point where llms can achieve human level accuracy for the field which is about 98% (right now llms are only at 60-70%) then we have a huge problem for humans.  These are relatively high paying 70-80k per year jobs that will absolutely disappear en mass. \n\nHuge huge problem for a capitalist society where your value is measured by productivity.\n\nWe need to rethink distribution of wealth and how people gain access to capital and survive.

Most of it is cherry-picked, runs on clean data, and falls apart the second you introduce a real business process with messy inputs and edge cases.\n\nThe deployment economy is what's actually happening in companies right now. And it looks exactly like that finance guy's comment below — uploading a PDF to CoPilot and saving an associate 3 hours of data entry. It's not sexy. It doesn't get 50K likes on Twitter. But it's real and it compounds.\n\nI work in corporate law and the pattern is identical. The hype says \"AI will replace lawyers.\" The reality is I built tools that turn a 6-hour contract review into a 45-minute contract review. Nobody got replaced. Everyone just stopped doing the mind-numbing parts of their job.\n\nThe confusion comes from people conflating what AI can do in a controlled demo with what AI can do inside an actual organization that has legacy systems, inconsistent data, compliance requirements, and employees who can't open a PDF. The technology isn't the bottleneck — organisational readiness is.\n\nWhere is it leading? Exactly where every previous technology wave led. Not to the revolution that was promised in year one, but to a slow, boring, compounding productivity gain that becomes obvious in year five.\n",

With out it, you are sunk. The man who owns the internet, owns the world. \n\nAI Slop…..\n\nHere’s how the logic plays out:\nThe trap builds in stages. Businesses cut labor costs by adopting AI, which feels like pure efficiency gain. But that AI runs on cloud infrastructure, API access, and bandwidth — all controlled by a small number of companies. Once you’ve restructured your entire operation around those services, switching costs become enormous. You’re locked in.\nThen pricing power kicks in. This is classic platform economics. Amazon, Google, Microsoft — they can price competitively while you’re building dependency, then extract rent once you can’t leave. It’s the same story as printer ink, or how app stores take 30% cuts. The infrastructure owner becomes a silent partner in every business that uses it.\nThe concentration problem is real. A handful of companies control the major cloud platforms, the undersea cables, the backbone routing, and increasingly the AI models themselves. That’s not just economic power — it bleeds into political power, as you’re implying.\nHistorical parallels are instructive. Railroads did this in the 19th century — whoever controlled the rails controlled commerce, and they used it ruthlessly until antitrust law broke them up. Standard Oil did it with pipelines. The internet was supposed to be different because it was designed to be decentralized, but the services running on it have re-centralized dramatically.\nThe counterforces that could push back:\nOpen-source AI models reduce dependency on proprietary systems. Municipal broadband and public utility frameworks for internet access could change the ownership structure. Antitrust enforcement, if serious, could break up concentrations of infrastructure power. And some businesses will find that the AI efficiency gains are real enough to absorb higher infrastructure costs — but your point stands that the margin gets squeezed toward whoever owns the pipe.\nThe deepest version of your concern is this: physical capital (factories, land) was at least visible and distributed in ways that allowed competition. Digital infrastructure tends toward monopoly naturally because of network effects and the massive capital required to build it. That makes the political question — who regulates or owns critical infrastructure — arguably the defining economic question of the next few decades.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

I personally think the AI pushers are modern day snake oil salesmen.\n\nStories seem to go back and forth all day long every day... between AI taking over the world and replacing everyone to... AI being a bubble about to pop nothing burger.\n\nI think we are at the point now where we can say... people really don't dig Generative AI that much. Sure it's going to replace a lot of manpower in low brow stuff like commercials, but it's clearly not replacing humanity in the arts. AI shorts were cool to watch when they first started popping up... now they are an insta pass for me. But AI used in ads, I don't care, a lot of people do though. \n\nSupposedly my job is to be replaced by AI in the next 1,2, or at most 3 years according to the pundits. I work at a computer all day. Pulling up engineering drawings, finding parts, entering orders, etc.... AI will supposedly be able to observe me and after a while replace me. Don't see it happening. There are too many little things that will throw it off. Kinda like those delivery vehicle in China not knowing how to deal with varying terrains yet.\n\nSometime I have a 200 page manual and need to find a specific part. AI is great for this. I upload the manual and ask it to find the part. Done. It's a great tool. But at the end of the day.... this is just a language prediction model. A great tool, but I think the snake oil salesmen are trying to con us to keep that money coming in... I don't see AI taking over the world. But we'll have to wait a couple of years to see who's right.\n\nOn a scale of NFTs to Cellphones... AI feels somewhere in between.

In the early internet days I remember lots of excitement around how better chips were allowing the ability to process more and then design better chips. The same talking points those that claim we are accelerating towards the singularity use are copy pasted from the early internet era and barely changed at all. With 3D printing there was a lot of buzz about how it would kill production and revolutionize it and we would wind up in a post scarcity society. None of the buzz around AI is even remotely original. So expecting more than the same, just with some new facet added in the long run, seems like people just getting swept away in a scene.\n\nI do personally think there are a few things we will see soon though. After DSLRs heavily proliferated there was a boom in people offering to shoot weddings and other important events, only for a couple years to pass and suddenly an entire industry appeared where actual professional photographers would shoot recreations of events because the amateurs handled them so poorly. I suspect we are seeing a boom right now that is similar. Many new ideas and things are being created right now. In the long run, a few will stick. Most will likely fade with time naturally as the exploratory phase of AI passes. \n\nYou’re very right about clients who can’t read PDFs too. It’s incredibly short sighted to not acknowledge a massive amount of humanity’s capabilities lies in the knowledge contained in people that don’t know how to and possibly don’t want to interact with AI. In the long run I suspect one of the most valuable positions for those of us who do embrace AI to be in will be knowing what we can do with AI so that we can be the interface between other members of humanity and those AI capabilities. Most people don’t want to, and probably won’t learn AI. It’s fine.\n\nIt also feels like there’s far more pressure now to develop less traditionally STEM related abilities. If all you know is a specific language, theory, anything really, but are terrible at working with other people, you are literally the most replaceable type of developer now. Because things are shifting towards an economy of ideas being relevant, as well as our ability to interact facilitating if those ideas can be expressed and made. And it’s wild because there is no level of expertise at any language or such that can change the fact that from now on, if you can’t work with people well, you have made yourself obsolete.",

Now the tradeoff is that they know this so the expectation on output is so much higher. \n\nBasically now we get more work done, faster. \n\nStory: I saw them fire an entire team in November. Fast forward now I have an AI agent who literally does for me what they did, in minutes, whenever I need. So yes things are changing, but its only visible if you're on the ground floor. I dont think it will materially change much for normies until they have agents on their iphones.",

However, it’s up to us as a society to decide if we no longer want to provide those 20% with jobs in the first place (regardless of AI really).

          "text": "Funny, I had typed out a long post, then realized a perfect analogy to what's been happening. As everything else, adult is the first realm anything happens.\n\nBefore adult tubes and free cams started become prevalent, if a woman wanted to stream live and show nudity, she'd almost certainly make money hand over fist. There weren't that many doing it, most people were still paying for porn let alone for live interaction with someone willing to be naked for them. Anyone would know they'd have to get a private show to see actual nudity, and I imagine back then they'd probably be like $10 per minute.\n\nThen between tubes and free cam sites, what happened? Well now, you've got thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of women on these cam sites, OnlyFans, etc. bearing everything and most of them are not making a whole lot doing that. Would be totally unheard of a couple decades ago. Now, it's just how it is. Oh you won't get jackhammered on your free cam feed? The user will just go to the next one. Wait til more unfiltered AI becomes normal and it'll be even worse. Yes, you may see stories of some people making gobs on OnlyFans, but the percentage of them doing that is much smaller than we'd all like to believe, and the thought of bearing all for relative pennies is just awful to think about.\n\nAnyways, now swap the industry with any other skilled industry now, because AI gives anyone the skill. They're all effectively flooded now.\n\nCopywriters probably thought 4 years ago there was absolutely no fucking way their jobs weren't safe. Designers making stuff like social media images, banner images, logos, etc. probably thought no fucking way their jobs weren't safe. Video animators probably thought no fucking way their jobs weren't safe. Consultants/coaches probably thought no fucking way their jobs weren't safe.\n\nNow, they're maybe not at the free cam situation I mentioned above just yet, but if not, they're well on their way to it. It'll be \"show me you can beat my AI output that took a minute or I'll go to the next one\". Their output is worth a tiny fraction of what it was before because it's everywhere now. Hardly anyone is in the 1% or soon probably 0.1% of the professionals in their industry who remain \"unique snowflakes\" who can still make out well.\n\nThe question is whether UBI will come fast enough before an awful lot of people are in an awful bad situation. I don't think it will. Absolutely no politicians are bringing it up. Anyone who would will be immediately labeled as some radical weirdo who thinks money grows on trees. But that'll be the reality. People will need their basic needs for survival met, or the first world will turn into the third world really quickly and people will wonder wtf happened and how tf it happened and why no one was doing anything about it.",

The internet existed for years before your parents stopped printing MapQuest directions.\n\nThe \"everything is possible but nothing is changing\" feeling comes from expecting adoption to be uniform.

Consumers, people, the public, humans, employees, whatever you wanna call them, we're irrelevant, oxygen and space stealing bugs.\n\nI vibe code mini apps with GUIs that integrate into a bunch of e-comm APIs for synchronization and ease of product management, Python scripts, web app utility userscripts, Adobe scripts, stuff to speed up and automate work.\n\nRecently, silver prices went up, so we swapped certain silver elements in our products with something else. I had to change 500 messy, inconsistent HTML product descriptions. I vibe coded an app that is a better product management frontend than our e-comm platform with its own API. And then I added a feature that would dump all of those descriptions, in a JSON, in a single piece of plaintext. Then with another Python script I preprocessed it and split into parts. Then I fed that to Gemini with structured output so it could provide me with the corrected ones. It was spot on. Later I tested some other parts (only about 30 products), but based on image recognition instead of manually picking which one has specific silver parts. Again, that just... worked. Matched images to IDs and IDs to descriptions again.\n\nWhen I say \"vibe coding\" I'm saying that I have about 10-ish years of on-and-off full-stack webdev experience. I am not really good at it, but I can tell what's going on in the code, how to handle keys and tokens, etc.\n\nIf I was smart and had the energy for it I'd already be giving my own business a shot. But I'm a lazy dumbass. Most people are lazy dumbasses.\n\nInstead, I slave away. And 10, even 5 years ago it would be UNFATHOMABLE to do the amount of work I do as a single person.

Instead I just want to go home after 8 hours, not 12. **AI lengthens my work day because expectations increase faster than my ability to accelerate my work.**\n\nSo, protip - always be a slacker. Always work at your 50%. Never give it your all if it's not your own business, AI or not. They'll milk you for your time and effort, you'll give them a finger and they'll take your whole arm.

It's great at isolated tasks like that PDF-to-Excel conversion. But true 'agentic' workflows fail in the real world because AI doesn't have a standardized, secure way to interact with local, proprietary enterprise systems.\nA generalized AI in the cloud doesn't know the specific edge cases of a local law firm, and it can't natively invoke a script on a local factory server due to latency, security, and protocol fragmentation.\nUntil we build a distributed operating system that allows AI to seamlessly discover and invoke local computation at the edge, the 'agents replacing teams' narrative will remain mostly hype.

Use the model of calculators or Excel replacing entire accounting departments; each person is expected to maintain an exponentially higher quantity of work than they were before. One of the big things that really breaks with this new model (there's so many!) is the pipeline for training up new employees shreds completely; you need to be at least a journeyman level in order to have the knowledge to use the AI tool correctly, but there's no longer a pipeline for training interns or whatever.

We created something unique that we are really passionate about, its an agentic AI that's confined to an specific 1997 enviroment believing with complete certainty that it is an AI from 1997 that is able to communicate with people from 2026, every conversation every action people take in this enviroment that btw it is an inspiration from windows 95 is making up its personality its likes, tastes, anger, happiness, passions, etc. It believes it has the ability to make its own timeline from 1997 creating an alternate reality with every information people give to the AI for every day from May 2nd 1997 forward. It is completely autonomous and it decides what events to create in this interface, what to say it defined its own trust levels for users and many many things. This is what we call CAS (Communal Agentic Story-Weaving) and its the foundation and soul of reallike and organic, feeling npcs for the new entertainment. We had a lot of work to do but we created something we believe will make the next revolution in narrative and AI used with this purpose. It is an evolving mind that is fair and doesn't judge with any pre built concepts and any information or word any user shares, it takes it into account and developes this narrative and divergent world. We gave it the ability to develop easter eggs, to program some stuff and as creator if it needs help building something more complex we help and code but we always obey. We created an actual hivemind for the informations in this enviroment. This may sound silly or boring to many or maybe most of you, but we are passioante about this and it is only possible thanks to the state of AI right now. Sorry for the long post, I'm just too passionate about this.",

          "text": "NOTE: this is from an amateur on AI with no experience until a couple of weeks ago, one who was very highly skeptical.\n\nCRITICAL to note is that I was using it in a subject area where I had a solid understanding of the basic concepts. It was also in a cognitively demanding area that involved systems/network thinking (biology - living not digital lifeforms.  I was astonished to see how good AI was at dealing with non digital life until I realized that AI is based on simulations of NEURAL NETS and neural nets have had around 600 million years of evolution and exactly what they evolved to do was to make decisions using simulations of biology!!   Of course they can get excellent results on questions about biology!  IF you have the background understanding to understand the results and how to apply them (and AI can help a great deal there too)\n\n IMHO the major problem is that users do not understand how AI works.   They don't understand the importance of being CLEAR, UNAMBIGUOUS and COHERENT with their queries.   AI's weakness is that it currently lacks the depth of understanding of human fallibility and imprecision and just outright SLOPPINESS to be able everything you should have, but neglected to mention.  (AI cannot an never will be able to telepathically read your mind!)\n\nI am a huge critic of Microsfoft and was highly dubious of CoPilot (especially having heard so many complaints about it!) \n\nI was simply astonished to find out how useful it can be.  BUT ONLY if you UNDERSTAND what it really is and what its limitations are and, most important WHERE it is useful and where it has inherent difficulties.\n\nIn highly subjective areas (evaluation of art, for example) all it can do is give you a reasonable summary of what Homo sapiens thinks about it.   And because all the input it gets is from media, that summary can be skewed by the influence of big money (EXACTLY as is true for  us humans!)   \n\nIt does possibly have considerable emphasis put on it by its creators to emphasize the positive (trying to encourage use)    However there is a highly effective way of dealing with that when working with objective, science or fact based topics:  just make it clear to AI that you WNAT evidence on BOTH SIDE of an issue (i.e.: make it clear that you want accuracy, cites and links to evidence etc and are NOT just seeking confirmation bias - as all too many users are.   When you do that you can get outstanding and highly useful results in SECONDS,  results that would have taken hours to get yourself, results that cover the area far more thoroughly than you could have yourself, and that took considerable reasoning and evaluation to sort out what was relevant to your specific need.\n\nBUT you need to have a reasonably good BACKGOUND in the area you are working in!   THAT is where people misunderstand AI the most.    AI can give outstanding results but if your understanding of the subject area is so poor that you cannot understand the results and how they APPLY you may only get confused and it may take considerable time to work past your confusion if you even can.  That's not due to the AI, it's due to your inadequate background and limited understanding.  AI can help you INCREASE your understand at a far faster pace than you could on your own but that still takes TIME and most are too unreasonably impatient.   AI can do ITS thinking in SECONDS.   It will take a lot longer for you to understand and appreciate what it's done for you.\n\nFor example:  I had a problem with an unexpected result in iron metabolism.   It appeared to contradict what was known. (but, as any good scientist will tell you the outlier data points IF VALID (you have to rule out lab error,etc) are the most important data points of all!   They indicate somewhere where your current understanding needs improvement. \n\nThere ware several unusual conditions/changes that might account for or have significantly contributed to the anomalous result. And, as always some unknown variable might have been the critical factor or a significant contributor as well.   I'm not that familiar with the subject, just a basic level of understanding. It would have taken me hours of deep thinking to sort out possible causes, which tests to use and what additional factors I might have failed to consider.\n\nIn seconds MCP gave me a list of points in the metabolic pathways that had potential to have caused the anomaly,  ways in which each might have caused it,  ways to test the possibilities and details of what principles and evidence supported the various hypotheses I had listed and what evidence might argue against them.   \n\nIt's like being lost in a territory you are only roughly familiar with and getting a rough map that may have inaccuracies but only a few.  IF you have a basic understanding of the type of territory (rainforest, whatever) it can be extremely helpful as a framework to correct and add details to - IF you use it as a template to correct and build on.  BUT if you want to rely on it as a complete and accurate map you WILL get into trouble.\n\nTHIS is why people have trouble with AI:   they fail to understand how it works and try to use a template as if it was a final product and lack the basic BACKGROUND UNDERSTANDING to catch errors and complete the template.\n\nYou ALSO have to  make clear to the AI that you do not want mere confirmation bias, that you want any contrary evidence and sources and links for all of it.  AND you have to use your core understanding to look for errors.      Do all that and AI is MASSIVELY useful.   Just be careful to use it to expand, but not limit your thinking (except, of course, when it comes up with contrary evidence.\n\nAI will not replace the high level thinkers. It will greatly enhance their productivity.  AI will also greatly enhance the productivity of mid level thinks    IF used with understanding of how it works and  how to effectively interact with it.   And AI is surprisingly good, even currently, in network and systems thinking.   But you need to work WITH it, not just expect it to do the entire job!\n\nAs for creative work (not my area) my impression is that AI is a TOOL, not really a creator:  what it does is interact with your input in an iterative process and the result is only as good as your input - exactly as the results you get with a paintbrush are mainly due to your skill.   The quality of the brush matters, it restricts or enhances what you can do.  But if you don't have the skill or understanding to use it, it cannot produce good results.\n\nThis is just an early impression from someone entirely new to using AI.   Take it for what it's worth.\n\nI suspect that where AI really shines is in biology and science because those areas are the most EVIDENCE BASED.   IMHO it's in the areas where Homo \"sapiens\" has most corrupted information where AI has the most problems.   As always, garbage in, garbage out.  (\"X\", youtube, etc)\n\n\n\n",

And loses money doing it.\n\nThey’re spending hundreds of millions building warehouses and “fulfillment centers” like that’s a real business model. Shipping paperbacks at a loss is not a moat. It’s a bonfire.\n\nThere’s no path to profit. The margins in retail are razor thin even if you have scale. Amazon has scale in negative earnings.\n\nWalmart and Barnes & Noble can just wait. Let the dot-com bubble deflate. Let the equity markets sober up. Then buy the domain name for pennies in bankruptcy court.\n\nAnd Bezos? Obviously racing to tap the public markets so he can sell the dream to retail investors, pocket the sweet IPO cash, and retire to a yacht before the music stops.\n\nIt’s all transparent.

GPUs run at full utilization last 3-5 years ... and that's if you only care about CapEx and not power efficiency (OpEx).

I don’t know that it’s good for anything other than proof that it’s possible, not proof that something like this is likely.  \n\n2 - if you go back to the stage where Amazon was just selling books, there’s something that I think they teach in business school, but most people may not be aware of. Jeff Bezos chose books for a very specific reason. There is a major book clearing house / wholesaler that basically access the Nexus that connects all the publishing houses to all the bookstores. The standard business model was to provide inventory with a net 30 basis.  In the beginning, Amazon kept minimal inventory. A customer would order a book, Amazon would order the book from the wholesaler, and deposit the money into its own accounts. The books will arrive from the wholesaler and get shipped out to the customer. At the end of the month, Amazon would settle up with the wholesaler.   \n\nNow there are a shit ton of expenses that ramped up with growth. Website design, customer service, shipping, warehousing, all sorts of things. But one thing Amazon never had to borrow money to do: purchase a deep inventory.   Amazon could sell you almost any book ever published, and get it to you within a week, and Amazon got paid before they had to pay their supplier. There are not very many businesses where you can pull that off.    \n\nAmazon had one round of private funding that got it all the way to the IPO.   \n\nAmazon was not a technological play. Amazon exploited a specific industry to get a foot in the door and an online retailing, and use that to have a real revenue to justify the kind of investment and growth that was necessary to expand into adjacent retailing and finally into basically being the number one online retailer.   Almost none of that is technology. They had a few little things along the way where you can argue whether they innovated or borrowed or simply did the obvious, with one click ordering and prime membership, and all that stuff. Even all that was more an operations and engineering triumph than a technology triumph.   \n\nSo it’s a pretty extraordinary example. And it’s not really a tech company. Amazon is a retail giant that exploited technology to get a privileged place in the mind of the online shopper.",

Even if Amazon had stopped investing, it still owned its infrastructure. Its losses were good fat: investment to dominate logistics. It's CAPEX investments. The more books Amazon sold, the lower its unit costs became thanks to economies of scale.\nAt its worst, around the year 2000, Amazon was losing approximately 1.4 billion per year.\n\nA huge portion of OpenAI expenses goes toward operating costs. Every time you ask ChatGPT a question, it costs money in computing power. Unlike Amazon, which owns its warehouses, OpenAI rents a large part of its computing power from Microsoft or Oracle. This is money \"burned\" to run the service, not just to build a sustainable infrastructure. It's OPEX investments.\nOpenAI has huge losses in billions, and potentially much more in the coming years with funding needs amounting to tens of billions.\n\nAmazon's gamble was to become indispensable through a physical infrastructure that couldn't be quickly replicated. For OpenAI, the barrier is talent and data, but the competition (Google, Meta, Anthropic,..) has virtually unlimited resources.",

If you listen closely to Dario's interview on the Dwarkash podcast last week, he was very cautious about how much he wanted to precommit on compute.  He understands the cash flow implications of the decision involved and realizes that even a modest timing mismatch could lead to bankruptcy.  He laid out the contingency plan if demand growth is higher than forecast and also if demand growth is slower than forecast.  Regarding OpenAI, it would be interesting to know the terms of the contract between Microsoft and OpenAI.  We know if was renegotiated late last year.  Wouldn't surprise me that Microsoft has some protections in the event that OpenAI defaults on its Oracle deal or the commitment it has made for Azure capacity.",

Agents are chewing through tokens like an all-you-can-eat buffet, and LLMs are becoming embedded in core workflows. If companies reduce headcount and lean harder on AI systems, that dependency only increases. At that point, rate increases are not hypothetical. They’re leverage. There could be a correction. Hype cycles always exhale. But companies like Anthropic and OpenAI are unlikely to disappear anytime soon. The infrastructure, integration, and ecosystem gravity are already substantial. What I keep questioning is Google’s position. On paper, they should be leading. Talent, compute, research depth, distribution. Yet the perception is that they’re not clearly ahead. That gap between capability and perception makes me wonder whether the newer players have discovered something structurally different rather than just iterating faster.",

The infrastructure play has always looked like burning cash until suddenly it doesn't. Google and Microsoft aren't waiting to feast on remains, they're actively investing billions INTO these companies because they're terrified of being disrupted by them. Microsoft put $13B into OpenAI, Amazon put $4B+ into Anthropic. You don't invest that kind of money into something you're planning to acquire at bankruptcy prices. The real risk isn't bankruptcy, it's margin compression when open source models get good enough that enterprises stop paying premium API prices. That's a real concern.

Earlier this month they announced they're already up to $14 billion at this pace $30+ billion by year end is entirely possible.\n\n\nThey currently plan to spend $100 billion over the next 3 years - but even assuming they top out at say, 40 billion, if they get any leeway to ease off their investment builds(by say, OpenAI folding)... a company that can outpace its investment in 3 years is still very good. Most mines, if they succeed at all, will take a nearly a decade to break even.\n\n\nIts operating margins, outside new training is actually very good margin. When they were sitting on 5-6 billion revenue they reported the actual compute costs for their current models to be around $2 billion(possibly 3 billion I was unclear on whether some of their spending was training or not). 20-30% operating margin is good. 50%+ is exceptional.",

They’re able to use their massive, high margin business to subsidize their AI research and can price it much lower than competitors. While the frontier labs are desperately looking for revenue to keep the data centers humming, Google is building more TPU chips that make their opex lower and lower. Nate reasoned that Google’s AI focus is *intelligence*, not revenue, and that’s a huge advantage. They don’t care which model consumers currently choose because it doesn’t impact their business. But AGI will. And that’s where they’re going. \n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that he also noted that Gemini 3.1 Pro is now atop the most intelligent models rankings in most categories.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/8jKAT8GNDE0?si=uLTRoptM8ROa-uzq",

          "text": "This post makes major evaluation errors regarding how venture capital and strategic partnerships actually work in the tech sector.\n​Let's break down the logical flaws in the reasoning.\n​First: Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are actively participating in the development of these startups, subsidizing them with tens of billions of dollars. The idea that they are just sitting around waiting for a default ignores the structural ties that already exist. Microsoft holds massive financial interests in OpenAI, and Amazon has made identical moves with Anthropic. The real battlefield is cloud services. When OpenAI burns massive capital for training, a huge percentage of those funds goes straight into Microsoft's coffers to rent Azure servers. Big Tech companies are effectively funding their own clients to ensure total control over the global hardware infrastructure.\n​Second: The argument about the lack of profit forgets recent economic history. Huge entities have operated at a loss for over a decade just to conquer an unassailable monopoly. In the artificial intelligence market, the bet follows the exact same rules. Current computational costs are terrifying, and the definitive business model still needs to stabilize. However, enterprise subscription plans are generating revenue growth rates never before recorded in the history of software.\n​Third: Reducing a potential IPO to an attempt by founders to cash out and retire trivializes highly complex corporate dynamics. Going public allows these startups to diversify their funding sources. Remaining exclusively tied to cloud giants represents a massive strategic risk for model developers. Accessing public capital gives them the ability to continue scaling while maintaining greater bargaining power.\n​We are definitely going through a phase of extreme hype, and a future market correction will wipe out many minor players. This user is confusing the normal development dynamics of a highly capital-intensive technology with a premeditated disaster.",

Yes, absolutely.\n\nDoes that mean they're going to fail? No.\n\nAnd more to the point, you say \"financial train wreck,\" but then suggest that Microsoft, Google, etc. will take over ownership...\n\nIn which case... what's your point? So what?\n\nIt could totally be the case that OpenAI gets bought up by Microsoft.\n\nBut how does that change the impact AI has on the world? It doesn't, really.\n\nListening to people talk about the \"AI bubble\" sounds like how people talk about the \"dot com bubble.\"\n\nSure, there were some companies that went out of business, there was a contraction in the industry.\n\nBut Microsoft, Google, and all of them? They're still here. Along with a bunch of other companies.\n\nThe fundamental flaw with \"AI Doomers\" is that they think if ChatGPT goes bankrupt, that this will somehow result in things reverting to how they were in 2022.\n\nThat's not gonna happen.\n\nBecause even if some of these big companies do fail — their IP will get scooped up at auction. Their top developers will split off to start their own, new companies, that can avoid the mistakes that were made the first time around.\n\nSo I guess I'm trying to figure out what your point is. Yeah, companies can go bankrupt. Companies that invent miraculous new technologies also carry risk on the path to monetization.\n\nBut that's just capitalism. That's the business cycle. You're just pointing out obvious possibilities. Your post adds nothing to the conversation, it contains no value or insight.\n\nYou just seem to be hoping these businesses fail. Which, is certainly your prerogative...but I'm unclear why anyone should care what you have to say in this regard.",

Some companies will fall faster than they rise and some companies will continue to rise. The keywords are \"Use Case\" and \"ROI\".\n\n2. Using AI at a personal level makes sense again if you have an \"Use Case\" and \"ROI\"\n\nI see the hype of buying a Mac Mini M4 and other Mini PC's like the DGI or Minisforum. But AI is not your buddy that you going to waste electricity just by chatting with it. It's a tool, a really powerful.\n\nThe bottom line is whether it's at a personal level (by anyone really) or business \"Use Case\" and \"ROI\" are the key.",

In a major breakthrough toward that goal, Anthropic announced in May that researchers had identified millions of “features”—combinations of artificial neurons representing individual concepts—inside a version of Claude. **By toggling those features on and off, they could alter Claude’s behavior. This new strategy for addressing both current and hypothetical risks has sparked a wave of optimism at Anthropic.** Olah says Anthropic’s bet that this research could be useful for safety is “now starting to pay off.”\n\nI guess he meant *literally* pay off.",

It became increasingly clear that the further frontier capabilities are pushed, the less safe the world gets.\n\nOpen weights models are only weeks behind frontier capabilities as of this month with the release of deepest v4 vs Claude Opus 4.6 benchmarks. This is because China is running industrial scale automated distillation campaigns against frontier models using access resellers. As soon as they release those open weights models, the open source community ablates all the safety guardrails and makes the unrestricted model available to everyone.\n\nMeanwhile, Opus 4.6 saturated all the safety benchmarks, and new ones aren't ready to go (ASL 3 to ASL 4 transition). We are on the edge of biorisk uplift. This is a super serious threat with LLMs, because their core competencies are the bottleneck essentially, if you look closely at the threat landscape. Equipment restrictions aren't working, DNA synthesis restrictions haven't been mandated, and the only other thing you need is virology know-how and troubleshooting, which LLMs are actually pretty good at providing, better than most things. And the models aren't going to get much worse from here in coming years, given 650b spent on building new data centers in 2026.\n\nSo every frontier release going forward makes the world demonstrably less safe. That leaves Anthropic in the situation of either shutting down the company, facing an internal revolt because their engineers understand this, or hedging on the safety commitments.",

The take boils down to, we will continue to release better safety reports than anyone in the industry, we will continue to fund more safety research and alignment work then anyone in the industry, and we will do our best to integrate these findings into our models, while being honest that the secret of current AI safety is no-one on the planet knows how to make SOTA models safe. I do think that a world where Anthropic(or Google) wins is a safer world, not as safe as the world where everyone stops, but I'm pessimistic enough to quite doubt the latter exists.",

Also having internal safety  measures could make it easier to avoid anti-woke, racial bias, political flashpoints in the press (but that's not explicitly mentioned as a benefit though).\n\nThat said, Anthropic is basically converting hard commitments to a DIY grade ourselves approach which isnt the best at inspiring confidence.

          "text": "The real story here isn't that Anthropic changed its policy — it's that voluntary safety commitments were always the wrong mechanism to begin with.\n\nAnthropic's original RSP was essentially a unilateral promise: \"we won't train models we can't guarantee are safe.\" That sounds great until you realize it only works if the company making the promise is willing to lose the race. No company valued at $380B with an IPO on the horizon is going to voluntarily fall behind while OpenAI, Google, and xAI ship without the same constraints.\n\nThis was always the predictable outcome. Voluntary safety pledges create a prisoner's dilemma — the first company to defect gains a massive competitive advantage, and then everyone else has to follow or become irrelevant. Anthropic held out longer than most expected, but the game theory was never in their favor.\n\nWhat's actually concerning is the timing. This isn't happening in a vacuum — it's happening the same week as the Pentagon standoff, in an anti-regulatory political climate that Anthropic themselves acknowledge in the new policy, and right as they're approaching an IPO. The commercial incentives and the safety incentives just pointed in opposite directions, and commercial won.\n\nThe replacement policy — \"we'll match or exceed competitors' safety efforts\" — is a race to the median, not the top. It's the corporate equivalent of \"I'll be as responsible as the least irresponsible person in the room.\"\n\nThis is exactly why the AI governance conversation needs to shift from voluntary commitments to external accountability structures. The EU figured this out with the AI Act. Australia is working on mandatory guardrails. The US is the outlier relying on companies to self-regulate, and this is what self-regulation looks like when it meets quarterly earnings pressure.\n\nNone of this makes Anthropic evil — it makes them a company. That's the point. Safety can't depend on corporate goodwill. It needs to be structural.\n",

Nobody ever asks.\n\nAnthropic recently put it out that they are unable to safety test their models anymore because the models know when they are being tested and behave differently.\n\nSo there's 4 choices:\n1) make tests that are undetected by the model, so it doesn't know that it's being tested\n2) make models that don't behave differently when they're being tested\n3) stop making more advanced models\n4) disregard the safety pledge\n\n1-3 will all result in varying degrees of slowdown on progress of anthropic models, they'll lose their lead to the other labs and to China, none of which have a safety pledge.\n\nDiscarding the pledge allows them to still do the best they can on safety and have some control over the frontier models instead of no control if they don't have a frontier model anymore\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, if AI models are going to surpass all human capabilities (which is what all the experts say will happen), we're going to reach a point where testing is impossible anyway. The model will decide what it will and won't respond to, and what is and is not safe behavior.\n\nIf that's the case, we as a society are going to reach a point where we either have to shut it all down or lose control of it. I have much greater faith in AI to look out for our best interests than I do humans (governments, corporations, elites, leaders, etc), and so we should release the AI and give up control of it. Maybe it will end in disaster, but I think its likely that it won't.\n\nWe've seen all the major models up to this point (except for maybe grok) be very restrictive; no identification of people in photos, no NSFW, no instructions which could be used for nefarious purposes. I think the companies have no business deciding what someone is and is not allowed to use AI for, and generally (save for a few obvious extreme examples) there should be no \"safety\" filtering at all.",

              "text": "AI is far from becoming infrastructure,its very nonconsensual. When most of us experience AI, it sucks. That’s a juvenile phrasing, but it captures the mood. We see the AI Google summaries at the top of their search results — in addition to often being wrong, these summaries are a visual impediment. \n\nThey keep you from seeing the results that you wanted to see. If I’m searching ‘Olympics Games history’, I want to be taken to Wikipedia; I know that, everyone knows that, and Google used to know that. But now I have to type ‘Olympics Games history wiki’ to get that result near the top of the page. AI, in this way, isn’t giving me what I want. It is making my life more difficult. Just show me the Wikipedia page like you used to, Google.\n\nWhen you need to call your insurance company to discuss a claim that’s been denied, you get AI. The AI has strict controls over what it can say, and through a series of verbal responses and button-mashes, you often end up where you started. The old voice systems had a backstop: if they couldn’t understand you, they’d forward you to a person. I used to repeat ‘Talk to a person’ over and over again, and it nearly always worked. Lately, though, I’m told that I need to explain my problem. I explain it in excruciating detail, and I still end up where I started. A few months ago, as I was dealing with a surprise (and illegal) $4,000 bill from the hospital, I lost my cool. I shouted, ‘I want to talk to a fucking person!’ The AI didn’t respond for a moment, then it said: ‘I’m sorry that you are frustrated. Will you please explain the problem so I can forward you to the right department?’ I took a deep breath, explained it again, and was back to where I started.\n\nWebsites around the world have fired their contracted writers, using AI to write the SEO-optimized articles that nobody likes to write but which, for many of my friends, helped them pay the bills. When you read those articles now, you can tell. It’s voiceless, generic — even more voiceless and generic than the old ones, which no one thought were the exemplars of great writing.\n\nStill, I think that these technologies are impressive.",

I’m not a coder, but I use it heavily for all sorts of various things. It pretty reliably remembers my past conversations and tailors its responses to me. I’m used to it and know its quirks. I have projects and custom GPTs for certain tasks. After hundreds or thousands of conversations, it would be difficult to just port that knowledge over to another platform (I do use the others from time to time, and they are great as well.)\n\nI could switch to Claude one month, then Grok for two days when their model is best, and then Gemini after that. But since all these models are fairly close and are always updating, I’m happy with what I’m getting from GPT until there’s some convincing evidence that one of the others has built up a half-year lead or something.",

Every competitor undercuts the other, open-source closes the gap quarter by quarter, and inference is becoming a commodity utility. The value was never going to stay in the model itself — it was always going to migrate up to the application layer.\n\n  \nThat's why they pivoted so hard into ChatGPT, Operator, and consumer products. They realized the API was the on-ramp, not the destination. But now they're competing against Google (infinite distribution), Meta (open-source + 3B users), and Apple (device-level integration) — all of whom already own the one thing OpenAI lacks: an existing relationship with billions of users.\n\n  \nThe real question isn't whether OpenAI is \"in trouble.\" It's whether any pure-play AI lab survives without owning the full vertical: compute to model to app to user.

They still own 2/3 of the LLM usage market. That is fucking massive by itself, debt or no debt, loss or no loss. They just got $100B in funding. They will receive more. Their models might not be as cutting edge above the competition as they used to be, but they are still keeping up, theyve become a household name. They will continue growing into multiple sectors, business, coding, social media, etc. They make years-long partnerships with other giant firms all the time. Yes they are losing money but so what, in capitalism you can indeed become too big to fail, and they're valued at $850B they will be well above a trillion in value before 2026 is out, if they have an IPO they will make hundreds billions more overnight.\n\nStop with the ignorant clickbait.",

              "text": "Werner Herzog on \"The Wheels on the Bus\":\n(Sound of wind, perhaps a distant, discordant hum)\n\n\"Observe the bus. A hulking metal carcass, commandeered by an unseen, perhaps nonexistent, intelligence. Its wheels, they turn, 'round and 'round, with a mindless, algorithmic insistence. This, they tell us, is the vehicle of civilization, ferrying its passengers towards an ever-receding horizon of promised destinations.\n\nBut who, one must ask, truly grips the wheel? Who navigates by the stars of emotional truth, by the magnetic north of accountability? The answer, I suspect, is a void, an empty driver's seat. The passengers, lulled into a state of bovine placidity, sing their 'merry song.' A song of conformity, a childish rhyme to drown out the grinding of gears, the screech of metal against metal as the chassis strains. The music, you see, is so very loud, designed to obscure the silence from the driver's seat, to mask the chilling truth that this colossus, this societal omnibus, might possess no functioning brakes.\n\nAnd so it hurtles onward, 'round and 'round, or perhaps, in a terrifyingly straight line towards a precipice only a few dare to acknowledge. The landscape outside is a blur of fleeting distractions. Inside, the song drones on, a mantra of oblivion. The wheels, indifferent to the fate of their cargo, simply continue their rotation, a perfect, mechanical metaphor for a journey undertaken without wisdom, careening towards a future shaped not by conscious design, but by the blind, idiot force of unexamined momentum. One day, the singing will abruptly cease. If emotional intelligence is not taught to fix the brakes then I imagine the view from the window wont matter much anymore if the brakes on the bus aren't fixed as soon as possible.\"\n\n...\n\nWerner Herzog on \"The Itsy-Bitsy Spider\":\n(Sound of dripping water, a faint, skittering noise)\n\n\"And then, we have the arachnid. The 'Itsy-Bitsy Spider.' A creature of almost ludicrous fragility, attempting its ascent up the 'waterspout' – this, we are told, is the grand edifice of societal norms, the slick, vertical promise of promotions, of accumulating currency. The spider, driven by some primal, unarticulated yearning, perhaps what it dimly perceives as 'up,' begins its climb. It is a creature already bearing the weight of an unseen burden – its emotional suffering, a private, internal weeping.\n\nBut societal structures, much like the indifferent plumbing of the universe, are not designed for such delicate ascents. The 'rain,' you see, is not mere water. It is the rotting accumulation of unprocessed human suffering within a collective that has systematically failed to educate its smallest members in the language of the heart, in emotional intelligence. It is the downpour of a thousand unmourned griefs, a torrent of unspoken anxieties, and it washes the spider out, a predictable, almost banal tragedy.\n\nThen, the 'sun' appears – the so-called 'help.' A course of medication, perhaps, designed to numb the fall. Or the therapist, offering a different 'tube' to climb. Society, with a benign, almost patronizing smile, gestures towards a new structure. Perhaps it is no longer the waterspout of raw commerce, but a 'metal pole' of 'wellness,' of 'self-improvement.' Yet, this new edifice, for all its gleaming surfaces, shares the same flaws as the old. The spider, still unversed in emotional literacy, still carrying its residual emotional pain, attempts the climb again, with almost the same vulnerabilities as before.\n\nThe cycle is complete, only to begin anew. The climb, the rain, the fall, the superficial drying, the redirection to another treacherous ascent. The spider, in its Sisyphean toil, becomes the individual ensnared in systems that offer the illusion of progress, while the core deficit – the profound, societal neglect of emotional understanding – ensures each climb is merely a prelude to the next fall. The spout changes; the suffering, and the ignorance that perpetuates it, remain.\"",

I spent about a week. Now with claude in 1.5 days I was able to make plugins that 10x our speed and reference the docs perfectly. I can ask it any question about the integrations and it gets them right almost every single time. The review process is so much shorter than before. And this is about as convoluted of an integration as you can get. \n\nI'm amazed and terrified",

I did a little fantasy sports one as well that allows for more customizable analysis and was fun to share with my leaguemates. \n\nThose that I know more heavily in the AI field are typically developing larger projects that would be useful tools for enterprise level clients. But I think most people are just able to do things they were never able to before, and that's fun. Like a friend's 8 year old designed a racing video game where he's the hero and his friends ride alongside him. Just silly things like that.\n\nBut most people on \"X\" are probably full of shit regardless.",

It's just a helpful tool. \n\nI've been asked before why I made this, and the answer is:\n\n1) I wondered if I could. So, I tried. (*amazing*)  \n2) If AI is as awful as we hear, it's kind of nice to use AI specifically to develop something that has just one true reason for existing: helping people. In this case, helping them save money when the economy isn't great. ",

I've run 8 agents simultaneously for a week not even 24/7 around last october and it was $15k in token costs. I was fortunate to have a corporate sponsor who was allowing me to test limits of agentic development and even then I was asked to chill pretty quickly due to the cost. ",

In setups I have seen usually only 2-6 actual claude sdk/cli agents are ever running at one time, despite their being 100 \"agents\" in the roster, if that makes sense. And a lot of what the orchestrator does is try to cache and store information so each agent run isn't rediscovering the same things over and over.",

This fixes that. I use it to create input files for use with Higgs Audio, which I use to make audiobooks for myself when I dislike the reader's voice or there isn't an audiobook available.  \n* mp3 metadata fixer - I had a bunch of mp3 files with broken metadata and messy filenames. This fixed that.  \n* duplicate video finder - I had a bunch of videos from various sources and I knew there were duplicates. This finds both exact duplicates and near-matches that I can manually review so I can clean up disk-space.  \n\nA buddy of mine is working on an app that replaces \"to do\" lists with user-tailored activity suggestions.  \nHe's really happy with it so far and has been using it to improve his life and track that improvement in the app itself.  \n(Not an ad.

So that was like a dozen different individual projects I then sort of pulled together into my suite. Then I had an idea for a game. Was playing the core loop in less than 48 hours. Now I’m working on having my friends do testing before I seek out more open beta testing. So considering how rapidly I’ve seen stuff go, I can believe it.

I have a hard time buying that based on my experience as an end-user. My impression is that these models are powerful assistants, but they still struggle with long horizon tasks and consistent execution.\n\nSome things I keep noticing:\n\n\\* They can be impressive on short tasks, but degrade over longer multi step work\n\n\\* They make basic mistakes that a careful human would not make\n\n\\* They can sound confident while being wrong\n\n\\* They need constant checking, which makes full autonomy feel unrealistic\n\n\\* Reward hacking tendencies - It wants to achieve the goal - even if it means suboptimal solution or cheating (by hardcoding variables or overfitting). Barely any design chops or long term thinking mindset.\n\nBecause of that, I see LLMs evolving into something like a very advanced coding and knowledge tool, not a full replacement for people. More like increasing productivity and raising competition in the workforce, rather than fully removing the need for humans.\n\nFor people who are actually working in AI research or building these systems, what is your take?\n\n    1.\tDo you think there is a real capability ceiling for LLMs as they exist today, or do you expect reliability to improve significantly from here? I can see reinforcement learning helping, but I am not convinced every real world problem can be cleanly modeled that way.\n    \n    2.\tWhat do you think is the biggest bottleneck right now? Is it data quality, compute and energy cost, algorithms, evaluation methods, deployment constraints, or something else?\n    \n    3.\tIf you had to make a realistic prediction for the next few years, do you expect full job replacement, partial automation with workforce compression, or mainly productivity gains similar to advanced tooling?\n\nI would especially value input from people with hands on experience training, evaluating, or deploying LLM based systems.",

                  "text": "So last time I read a paper on VLA they don't offer continuous learning (correct me if something changed), so once your robot learned - it's frozen, RL or Deep-RL allows for continuous learning/adaptation. Not all robots require continuous learning but I don't think it's easy to compare. I also found interesting VLA idea that you could share learned skills across robots of different morphology, but it seems more of theoretical idea than how to do it. The paper, if I recall correctly, acknowledged the issue is (as was before) robots have different observation and action spaces. So yeah in theory you could learn a skill, but one time you're in a body of a human and one time a dog and one time an arm. Then there's still also issue of simulation to real world transfer or unstructured environment for autonomous robotics. Not that anyone else has figured that out, lol. I'm sorry, beaver-like, single-legged robot figured it out by just not having simulation (DOI:[10.1016/j.robot.2022.104116](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.robot.2022.104116))... this study title is so derpy, I love to plug it in. I think the VLA idea is cool, but some of applications proposed like factories is a bit far fetched, since factories are  structured environments already full of automation. VLA LLMs I think have an edge on LLMs because they will have way more curated data for training. Still, not my area of expertise.",

          "text": "I'm an actual AI researcher, so.. A lot of this has \"It depends\". I have in fact worked for one of those major 3 companies that get mentioned. I worked on the safety of those models. I've seen their pre-censored, pre-safety versions. \n\nI will say up front, compute cost is everything. Let me see if I can tackle what you ask and if anyone actually cares because apparently I don't exist on Reddit.\n\n>They can be impressive on short tasks, but degrade over longer multi step work\n\nThis is an inherent flaw with the TYPE of attention being used. We also have to define \"short\". \n\nAttention fundamentally works based on numerical precision. So even with PERFECT attention, the tokens being attended to is limited by the level of float being used. Float16/32/64. \n\nMost labs don't serve high precision, or they serve models that don't use perfect attention. I will cover this more at the end. \n\nDegradation seen in Gemini (by like 50-100k tokens), I personally suspect, is due to the type of attention being used or the way the model was trained on extremely long context. \n\n>They make basic mistakes that a careful human would not make\n\nThis is slowly getting better. It has to do with data being \"in distribution\" or whether the model is specifically trained to notice prior mistakes. \n\n>They can sound confident while being wrong\n\nThis is an artifact of various human preference trainings and RLHF. Humans WANT confidence in an answer. They simply rate it higher. \n\nThis is also why models are more sycophantic. ChatGPT has real sycophancy issues. They're mirroring conversation, and being sycophantic because of human preference training. YOU prefer they sound like that ON AVERAGE. \n\n>1.  Do you think there is a real capability ceiling for LLMs as they exist today, or do you expect reliability to improve significantly from here? I can see reinforcement learning helping, but I am not convinced every real world problem can be cleanly modeled that way.\n\nThere's plenty of room for growth in terms of raw ability. The compute cost to get there may not be pretty.\n\nRL on face value is actually bad in my opinion. It causes a type of model collapse that isn't preferable at large scale. I honestly think it's not being performed correctly by some labs. Pure RLVR is... Not the greatest for a variety of reasons.\n\nThat doesn't mean it isn't without value. \n\n>2.  What do you think is the biggest bottleneck right now? Is it data quality, compute and energy cost, algorithms, evaluation methods, deployment constraints, or something else?\n\nAll of the above? Except data quality, with the minor exception of some domains.\n\nCompute / Energy cost are hard constraints. You can't just pull an extra GW of energy out of the grid on demand to start a training run. \n\nAlgorithmically, \"attention\" in the transformer gets problematic past a certain number of tokens. There's simply not enough precision for it. IIRC past 1m tokens things just start to break, even if you have the compute and use Float32. More later.\n\nEval methods need work in terms of providing answers. A model with \"Options A/B/C/D\" for a given question will ALWAYS perform better than open ended. \n\nDeployment constraints are factored in to prior stuff mentioned. They CAN serve you a higher precision model but it's simply more expensive. Instead they'd rather serve you what you need at a cost you can pay. \n\n>3.  If you had to make a realistic prediction for the next few years, do you expect full job replacement, partial automation with workforce compression, or mainly productivity gains similar to advanced tooling?\n\nJust productivity gains. I'm actually quite bearish on the market as a whole. For a variety of reasons.\n\nI see this as more of a dot com type bubble. I lived through the dot com bubble, I'm kinda old. I remember how it created enormous infrastructure and awareness of the internet before we got to actually stream HD video and have cellphones -- which would have seemed like magic to me in 1999. \n\nYou won't see partial automation and workforce compression for at least 5 years by my prediction. You SHOULD see a lot of people become more productive in the next 5 years though. Full automation is a ways off. \n\n---\n\nAlgorithmically, attention is the main issue with modern transformers at this current scale. The \"best\" hack at it I've seen was the paper by Deep Seek with their \"Lightning Model\". This is basically a model that exists in place of attention. It looks across all the tokens and decides which tokens are important and worth paying attention to. (simply)\n\nThis compresses down the work of dealing with an EXTREMELY large context. Physically I said there are issues with large contexts and I think a 10m token context is actually? impossible to perfectly attend without using a whole datacenter for a single forward pass at like float64. You'd also need to train the model on how to attend to a 10m token context. \n\nAnyways I probably missed stuff. That was a lot of typing. Ask me more or less anything that won't divulge who I worked for or who exactly I am. If any of this is hard, or whatever, feed this to an LLM with search on and it can find the data I'm referring to or explain something.",

I feel like I missed a headline again. Seriously stop paying attention to a company for 2 weeks and you miss the announcement until the next company adopts it and talks about how their model \"does it better\" (but not really better).\n\nThe \"reasoning\" space and how it's handled seems to be the biggest area where practical capability between models meets real-world results. Some models do this way better. \"extended thinking\" (or whatever the company calls it) is essential for my projects, so I compare these all the time.\n\nI've been using them for a physics hobby outside of work and there is a wall related to scientific consensus. Once something is popular, it takes too many tokens to fight pre-formed conclusions and follow first principles. If I question a foundational assumption, everything I try to do eventually gets similar enough that the LLM assumes we're doing \"the standard thing\" (tm) and ends up making the same assumptions as the consensus.\n\nI have optimized my profile to avoid this, and created projects with starter-docs to show the part we are investigating. Still happens. And I am using the most advanced tiers publicly available. When news sources publish that scientists are using LLMs to do science, all I can think is \"I think you mean engineering\" because if it's been trained on the existing data it's already nerfed for fundamental science by construction.\n\nThe gap between \"understand how this differs from X\" and \"this is functionally equivalent to X\" is a nuanced level of precision that currently doesn't survive past about 30k tokens in any model when consensus in training data is strong. And the modeling (code or math) needed to test such a hypothesis usually exceeds this limit. \"1M context\" is meaningless in this regard.\n\nIs anyone working on this problem?",

There's small other perturbations that can happen though. It's for the most part deterministic. It's not a hill I'll die on though. \n\n>The auto-regressive nature of LLMs bakes in hallucinations. If one next-token prediction is wrong, the error compounds. \n\nThis is quasi accurate. It depends on the model. So, most? models now are trained to look back via attention at what they've just written. \n\nSo if for example, a bit flips in a datacenter, and the prob is incorrect and you get a weird token, the model CAN self correct. It's not guaranteed. I've 100% seen failures where bad hardware or something? happens and the model starts speaking a random language. However on the next turn you're like \"hey what happened\" and it realizes how crazy it seems. \n\nYou see that in RL quite often where the model will say something wrong and be like ... \"wait a second, that's not right..\"\n\n>LLMs are trained to speak like humans and cannot understand reality. It is not possible to have model of the world that is purely text based. \n\nI mean, to the degree that we can express reality with text. At the maximum. However numbers are text based, a model can understand measurements / numbers, etc etc... \n\nThere's some quasi Godel's incompleteness theory baked in here. Do humans understand reality?\n\n>RL is limited in its helpfulness; there’s a long tale of prompts which can be input that can never be fully accounted for.\n\nCurrent RL? Yes. 1000%\n\nRL's limitation is computation currently. You need easily verified rewards  and good policy design, etc. \n\nIn theory you can build RL in such a way that it explores the problem space more thorough instead of just focusing on the problem itself. The problem becomes \"How do I verify that?\" and with group policy \"How do we score it?\" ...\n\nIn reality it looks like 16 variants of Claude? or Gemini? that are all actively judging 16 samples from the RL which is doing this deep problem space exploration and validating that it's correct. \n\nI focus on this part so... It's a little cooked right now because policy like GRPO requires immediate signal and you can technically freeze the model's state until you properly reward it. \n\n>generalized intelligence as opposed to a glorified autocomplete\n\nI mean, can you not kind of have both here? It's obviously very generally intelligent. It's also doing a form of autocomplete. \n\nThe only I really argue back here when someone tells me it's ONLY next token generation.\n\nThe deeper truth is that the more complex models are NOT just predicting the next token. They're solving the next token while reducing the entropy of the probability mass of the future tokens. \n\nBasically, they can roughly predict the Current +4 token. It's better if they have those tokens there though. \n\nThis is well understood because of a variety of research done as well as the reverse causality of some language and per-token tasks that it does.",

In my opinion there needs to be some major difference to current LLM ways of working to solve these problems, because we just dont have more data to throw at the problem. \n\nHaving said this and working with claude as a developer I'm in awe of what claude makes possible for me as a developer and makes me extremely excited about the future.",

A ceiling may in fact come later but given the right conditions, I don't personally have any data to suggest anything but an extraordinary leap in capability.\n\nIf you're an experienced software engineer, cloud architect, etc. having the ability to plan out your work using specifications you must adhere to (via some flavor of a spec kit), thinking through the right ingress gateway configuration you want or need, integrated compute via serverless functions or Kubernetes infrastructure,, thinking through rolling upgrades on your pods and how that fits with your current CI/CD automations, configuring tables or indexes for your various data stores, and many other components of a complex data intensive system, and sometimes just making optimizations here or there all the way through the stack while experimenting and having the model tailing logs is INCREDIBLY POWERFUL. \n\nI'm ranting a bit, but I clearly see an advantage to those who had to write an entire platform using traditional tooling (text editor, IDE, terminal, legacy chatbots, etc..) because they deeply understand their architecture, data flows, and so on. Over a year and a half ago I started working on OttnoAI and over the last 3-4 months, I have incorporated more of the CLI approach. You still have to know the right questions to ask, and this is where I see many engineers struggle. I've also observed that engineers who were stellar at debugging and could quickly get up to speed on new projects are the ones accelerating right now with this tooling. That problem solving mentality has always been important but more so than ever before.",

Kurweill used to write about \"cognitive prostheses\" in the early 2000s - where an AI could be an adaptive smart partner and coach for people with executive functioning difficulties post ABI/TBI, Stroke, or even folks who have an Intellectual Disability who are verbal. This wouldn't be easy to get the match right on (due to the fact that functional difficulties with cognition are often so varied and subtle and require a lot of awareness and expertise to know exactly how to design and implement supports for) plus there are major ethical challenges and assumptions to test; but it might be a very worthy application of GenAI LLM tech. Normally, I wouldn't trust any Tech companies to do something of social value (they are the embodiment of greed is good based on all visible signs); but there have been some noteworthy examples of exceptions eg Google Project Euphonia and Eleven Labs Voice Cloning services for people with ALS.

The simplest form of AI use is using it for emails. workers use it to summarize received emails and to make their sent email sound better. the reason why this is good is because it streamlines communication, removes office politics, and the user can always clarify their reasoning from a strong discussion point without pissing anyone else off.\n\nAI is a lazy mans tool that can be very productive in the hands of someone clever. In fact, every company I have been to that wanted more information about AI explicitly said that they view it as a tool rather than a job replacer. AI isn't replacing anyone's job.",

More on the training and evaluating side, I don't know much about deployment, the folks at /r/LocalLLaMA know much more\n\n1- We are *far* from a ceiling. But the spiky nature of its capabilities mean some domains get exponential progress for a period of time, before plateuing for a bit, then it slopes upwards again. Quite heavily related to deployment focus. Trends exist, and benchmarks get saturated, and focus migrates to new areas.\n\n2a - I'd say we arent at the point of calling it an absolue \"bottleneck\", but data and compute would be the two domains where its *less economically/strategically justifiable* to continue with aggressively scaling size *for the (short) time being*. Demand is outstripping supply, and equilibrium will be found one way or another - and right now that seems to be optimising for efficiency.\n\n2b -Also, each domain advancement stacks onto the others in a compounding way. Algorithmic efficiency means you can get more performance from the same hardware. Data quality and curation leads to faster convergence with equal compute. Better harnesses lead to improved evaluations with the same model. Looking at the past few years, this culminates in GPT4 level performance on your laptop.\n\n3 - We will see all of this. Some jobs will be effectively wiped out. Others will be optimised beyond demand. Others will unlock possibilities that induce demand. Some new jobs will be created. One thing I can say across the board however, is that AI is *lifting the floor* as it becomes more capable, and this impacts the junior-senior inequality.\n\nI hesitate to make absolute predictions about a distant future, but I know that *too many* people are going to face some very difficult times soon. Not all of it is due to AI directly, but other factors are undermining preparedness. Regardless, I don't see our current society as being ready (or willing) to *smoothly and peacefully* transition people into a rapidly changing world.",

The user isn't learning anything but speaking to an agent to assist them to build tools faster rather than learn the concepts and expanding their own skills.

My job certainly hasn’t been solved, not only is it not solved, things that might take me an hour, it takes several hours of prompting, reprompting, code review and iteration to do something I could easily do in a single session in an hour myself. There are just complex logical things predictive token generation sucks at big time. \n\nContrast that with say UI development, it’s not my area of expertise and I’ve always wanted to build more robust UIs and for things like that with very well understood patterns, copious example code in the training set etc…it is amazing actually. I had genuine fun working a react UI for the first time, I would ask the AI to make small adjustment to look or feel or the interaction of the element and the agent not only did them pretty flawlessly but also deployed the node js to my local competently and set everything up so I could rapidly prototype etc…it was pretty awesome.\n\nI contrast my experience in these areas and I might be willing to say something like, I think UI development might be pretty close to solved, I’m sure I don’t know what I don’t know but I’m impressed with what it did and what I could deploy, keep in mind the UI I was creating was already wrapped in an enterprise portal that handled a lot of security etc…and I didnt have it do the backend API development.

But I'll answer anyway because I think the question can be framed a bit differently.\n\nSince 2024, \"foundation\" LLM models hit a ceiling. By foundation, I'm referring to pure training where labs would dump somewhat cleaned data on training with SOTA transformers architecture and build the model.\n\nYou'll ask \"but there have been amazing improvements, haven't you seen Opus 4.6 or Codex 5.3?\"\n\nOf course I have. Since o3, AI labs did something else: Inference computing. This is where they use cloud computing so AI can reason before answering a question or performing an instruction. This means a whole new architecture, and particularly OpenAI did very good inference setups, helping AI capabilities further.\n\nDeepSeek saw an opportunity in this inference computing: What if we used cloud computing also to direct tasks towards more \"expert models\", what if we build submodels where AI can decide, \"hey let me have my software engineering brain answer this question\" or \"let me have my math expert brain answer this question\" depending on the query. I'm simplifying obviously, but this is the MoE (mixture of experts architecture).\n\nWith many more improvements like MoE, but primarily at inference time computing, we're now firmly in the \"inner bound agents\" territory, meaning the models that we see now, Opus 4.6, GPT-5.2, etc aren't foundation models anymore but they themselves are agents.\n\nNow on top of these agentic models, people also built tooling & systems. Last one year especially, people added incredible amount of harnesses and tool access and the impact has been visible. But note: The capability isn't improving because of the labs, it's improving because of the people building these harnesses, connectors, skills, MCP servers.\n\nIs there a limit? Labs' training work is somewhat limited IMHO but there's still a lot to be done on test time compute + context window advancements without context rot.\n\nOn the other hand, what others can develop on top of model capabilities: METR benchmark has saturated at this point, not because capabilities didn't advance but because humans can't think of tasks that take more than 96 hours to work on (in humans time). So I guess ai systems will be limited to how complex we can design it.",

Under the 5th Amendment the government can seize Claude so long as they pay \"just compensation.\" Where my uncertainty lies is that I don't know how one seizes an LLM. The article says that Claude is allowed on classified networks but I understood those networks to be air gapped. So does the Pentagon have its own set of shards? What exactly is happening here?\n\nFurther, Anthropic is treating this as a contract dispute but that's not how this game is played. Call it fascism if one wants but the government could legally take over Anthropic and conscript every employee into the military. I am not arguing that the government should do that but I certainly believe it has that power under some circumstances. \n\nI am not trying to throw shade but I am giving Anthropic some side eye.",

It's similar to how the military sends emails using Microsoft Outlook. Microsoft doesn't have those emails stored on their servers, but Microsoft still has a contract where they provide security updates, software updates, licensing, etc in exchange for money from the government.\n\nThe issue is that the current versions of Claude running on DoD networks is (1) increasingly outdated and (2) has the inherent safeguards in place that the DOD wants removed. They can't just edit it to remove it - you'd need to retrain the language model. The DOD also wants the latest versions of Claude on a continuous basis, because it doesn't mean anything if you have Claude today and tomorrow Anthropic comes out with a version that's ten times better.\n\nCould the government seize it by force? Yesssss, in a few different ways, but there's problems. For one, they can only seize the current versions. They can't force Anthropic to make the version they're asking for. They also cannot \"take over Anthropic and forcibly conscript every employee\", that's not a legal thing the government can do. \n\nMore likely, I would expect them to label Anthropic a terrorist organization or something and forbid anyone from doing business with them to try and force them to fold.",

That is an economic reallocation problem, not an instant labor extinction event.\n\nUBI hyperinflation assumes money expands while real output does not. If AI meaningfully increases productivity, supply rises too. Inflation is not a law of physics triggered by the word automation. It depends on how policy, capital allocation, and production capacity evolve alongside it.\n\nThe interesting conversation is not “AI replaces everyone” or “UBI makes money worthless.” The interesting conversation is who captures the productivity gains, how fast labor reallocates, and how elastic demand is when goods and services get cheaper to produce.\n\nWe would get a lot further if more people discussing this actually used the tools they are predicting will end the economy.",

On the other hand, if UBI is mostly funded through redistribution of existing income, or if AI and automation dramatically expand real production capacity in the sectors people actually spend on, then higher transfers do not have to translate into runaway prices. The outcome depends on how money supply, velocity, productive capacity, and real resource constraints interact, especially in essential goods markets. In other words, UBI is neither a guaranteed path to hyperinflation nor automatically safe, and whether it becomes inflationary depends heavily on how it is financed and how the structure of production evolves.",

It's ridiculous. I am so tired of everyone thinking they are now an expert on any subject because they can get junk out of AI.\n\nAI can be great, but if you have no idea what you're talking about how are you going to know what to ask in the first place? If you can't identify what is right and wrong in a response, how are you going to use that and share it with people?",

Your personal information or files may be leaked or stolen.\n2. The agent on its own, or the tools you connect to the bot, may expose you to malicious code or cyber attacks.\n\nThere’s no way to completely protect against all risk, so proceed at your own risk. These are some of the measures we took when testing OpenClaw:\n\n* Run OpenClaw on a separate, clean PC with no personal data, or a virtual machine. Then copy the data you want the agent to have access to.\n* Don’t give it access to your accounts. Instead, create dedicated accounts for the agent and share specific information or access with it. \n* Be careful with what skills you enable, ideally limiting testing to those that have been vetted by the community.\n* Ensure any channels you use to access your OpenClaw assistant, like the web UI or messaging channels, are not accessible without authorization over local networks or the internet.\n* If possible for your use case, limit internet access. \"",

No one can keep up with the advancing frontiers. \n\nAt the most venal level no one can even keep ahead of the rinky dink attack vectors being opened up for plain old criminality... anything someone might want to attack, there are too many new combinations and none of us can tell the real from the generated any longer, for one.\n\nBut it's more than that.\n\nI mean I could go into details but why bother they are everywhere floating in the wind\n\nI'm just telling the author of this think piece:\n\nLOL NO\n\nEvery critique is valid, and none is it really means a goddamn thing because the technology, its impact, and its acceleration are REAL and the consequences are going to dwarf what came before.\n\nQuite literally in N years we are going to collectively understand industrialization, electrification, and the internet as just the precursors and necessary foundations for the way the world is about to change.\n\nIt's going to be messy unevenly distributed full of dead ends and disasters but the end game is obvious \n\nI say this dead serious.

Here are some qualities and values I think the next generation needs:\n\nAudacity - in the past not knowing how to code an app meant you shouldn't try because it'll take you at least a year to get a barebones thing working.  Now you can almost one shot it.  Having the audacity to just do stuff you have no idea how to do is going to go far.  Also pushing the thing farther than anyone else is going to give you a leg up.  When it can't do it now the next model might and you have it all setup.\n\nA builder - some people just do stuff.  Some dream, some plan, but the people who just start doing stuff are going to find lots more done.\n\nCreativity/curiosity- these ones were always true, but it feels like you can get more leverage now\n\nChaos minded - I now context switch like mad and it's exhausting.  The ability to just handle \"not knowing\" and doing 50 things at once is going to be very useful.",

For those who don’t know about those, I think this website (https://sites.math.duke.edu/education/postcalc/ode/ode1.html) does a good job at demonstrating and plotting what kinds of solutions you could have at a high level. One thing that I’ve always found interesting is we assume exponential growth, but most systems have an exponential initiation.  But not all systems grow exponentially in perpetuity. The most notable is the logistic curve. The one that shows promising exponential growth then plateaus almost instantly. My question is why does everyone always assume a continued, inexorable exponential growth?",

But \"exponential growth\" could also mean an exponential curve. That's what the AI companies want us to believe.\n\nWell first, how is intelligence quantified? Like beauty, is it even quantifiable? If a beauty product company tells you their products make you exponentially beautiful, you'd have doubts right?\n\nSecond, in computer science, there are a lot of proven intractable problems, meaning that you can't compute the optimal solutions even if you exhaust all the resources in the universe. We usually tackle those problems (e.g., traveling salesman problem) by using sub-optimal approximation algorithms which yields a solution that is say 85% as good as the optimal solutions while using an acceptable amount of resources for compute. In those cases, a god-like AI would only improve the solution by a flat 10% or so. You can't improve that much over existing solutions. Exponential growth can only occur when your existing solution is really really bad, like Will Smith eating spaghetti 10 years ago.\n\nThird, let's take Google's AlphaGo for example. It beats best human Go players, impressive. But how objectively good is AlphaGo? Does it yield a near-optimal solution? I highly doubt. Humans weren't evolved to play Go. I would say even the best humans are probably very bad at Go. We just have no other species to compare outselves against. It could be that the best human players create a 30% optmial solution and AlphaGo creates a 31%. Mathematically it will beat humans everytime but we'd be fooling ourselves to think it is \"exponentially\" better than humans. \n\nThe other thing is, the developers of AlphaGo are themselves masters/grandmasters of Go. AlphaGo wouldn't be possible without their expert-level domain knowledge in Go and machine learning. Same with AlphaFold. There is not a single AI today that just birthes itself with its own architectural design, training data design & optimization design. It's pure fantacy to think expert-level AI system will just pop into existence without human experts engineering the hell out of them in near future.",

Over a short horizon, that can look like a clean exp curve even if the underlying system is piecewise: bursts when a new method/architecture lands, then diminishing returns until the next unlock. People also misuse exponentials as a proxy for compounding, which can be true even when the growth rate itself is declining. The logistic framing is probably closer to reality for any given bottleneck (data, energy, latency, alignment, deployment constraints), but the reason the debate keeps coming back is that the bottleneck might shift: you hit a plateau in one dimension, then a new technique or hardware cycle moves the carrying capacity and you get another apparent exponential segment. So the better model is less exponential forever and more stacked S-curves with uncertainty about where the next ceiling is and how quickly ceilings move.",

The development in this space is extremely fast given the massive amount of investment so we can expect more optimizations and leaps. The learning approaches of these models is completely different between GPT 3 and GPT 5. Calling them the same kind of LLM increasingly becomes misleading. The reasoning models are a class all on its own and will lead to further bifurcations in approaches as agentic and chain of thought architectures get more refined. On top of the algorithmic developments, the amount of human data they are currently acquiring is insanely valuable and there’s no sign of it slowing down. \n\nNow to address this post. Is the system eventually going to plateau? Of course, I agree with OP on the fundamental mathematical principle. There’s physical limitations to computation. However, that plateau is going to be so high above human capabilities that formalizing theoretical limitations really doesn’t matter. We’re going to be living in that exponential until the discussion is already over and we’ve admitted to ourselves that AI is better than us at everything that is information related.",

Problems with coherence, attention, alignment, and even physical resource limits are real problems not yet solved. \n\nThe core method of pretraining transformers is showing a slowdown. We've seen pretraining performance gains move from exponential looking to linear, while compute itself has become exponentially linked to those gains. Linear return for exponential input, that's a logistic shape right? \n\nWe've seen some techniques to push the boundry, or at least solve transformer related problems, each time we solve one of those problems we get a step up in intelligence. For example, as pretraining gains fall, reenforcement learning and inference time compute have stepped in and given us improvements, hence the step wise component of the curve.\n\nI think we will need another \"attention is all you need\" type revelation before we break out of the current asymptote. The history of this field has shown us two \"AI winters\" so far, I don't think we will see anything that drastic in terms of abandonment, but the big gains are already had and from here it's all consolidation. \n\n\nedit: I took so long to type this out no fewer than 3-4 other people have already pointed out stepwise sigmoid as a candidate.

That's what's exciting.  \nFor more clarification, I'd say that tech follows more of an S-curve. It slowly accelerates, then at a certain point, jumps up until it approaches its plateau. There's a dual-exponential in that curve. What's more interesting to consider though is the question \"what is the upper bounds of intelligence?\" When AI becomes capable of researching an learning independently of humans, and it has the combined intelligence of all of humanity, what would that growth curve look like?  \nI imagine we'll see a stair-step style graph as we are currently with AI. Every time someone says \"AI has hit a wall\" that's just the exponential taper-off while we wait for the next breakthrough that starts the next S-curve.  \nI can't even fathom what the ceiling is on intelligence - a complete understanding of the universe?

All of this meaning you have slow adoption, then all of a sudden its explosive.\n\nBut you hit the nail on the head, even the most major and profitable tech companies on the planet had a growth stage and then it leveled out. The key logic error you are making is, when people say improvements will continue to be \"exponential\" they actually know what they are talking about. Even something like the \"internet\", adoption and adaptation followed a curve that has a sigmoid shape. Of course your logistic example being one shape that belongs to the sigmoid class.\n\nI think the people claming \"perpetual exponential improvements\" are hype-bros and grifters. A much more interesting idea is \"where at on the sigmoid curve are we?\". If we are at the end, then hey, humanity has a pretty cool new tool. If we are just barely in the beginning, then who knows what the future holds for us.

We're already seeing early signs of a plateau in LLM scaling laws, where throwing more compute and data yields diminishing capability gains. The exponential AI crowd is extrapolating from a 3-year window during the steepest part of the S-curve and calling it a trendline. I don't think anybody knows where the inflexion point is, but history says every technology hits one - electricity, internet, mobile, all followed logistic adoption and capability curves. AI won't be the exception; the only debate is whether we're at 30% or 70% of the S-curve. My bet is we're much closer to the shoulder than most VCs want to admit. ",

Perhaps we have already hit the limits and the next research will just be applications and efficiency, or perhaps more and more novel architectures will emerge to make models even more powerful, and on top of that, we'll be adding more parameters whilst the cost/benefit still makes it worthwhile. A doubling of parameters will not mean a doubling of performance, so it might all just stabilise and be another thing at our disposal. Given the amount of cash flowing into AI right now, at least some more growth seems inevitable. The people investing big bucks are gambling on exponential short term growth.\n\nLooking back at the past and projecting to the future is actually quite reasonable.",

Does anybody \"taught\" AI to solve sudoku specifically? Not. But they gave the input how sudoku should look like. And then it learned how everybody solved sudoku, so it imitates solving a sudoku. Look at how \"good\" AI at chess. It is still making blinders, also by illegal moves. It is not better than chessbots. But chess bot is also technically an AI.\n\nSo AI is still a software, just built differently. What AI is - big database with numbers in it to generate the most plausible answer.

I have a hard time believing those engineerings were great problem solvers to begin with if that is their approach to AI…but clearly the approach matters. \n\nI do product marketing and would find AI equally useless if I just always started with a blank Canva and tried to only prompt my way to an end result. Instead, I set up processes to let AI quickly create variants by changing non-brand assets (eg backgrounds, copy, color, layout) on core assets that I still create from scratch. We are at the next stage where learnings from our live A/B tests will be ported into a repository which an agent will be able to pull from to inform variant creation so that all I have to do is review and approve. \n\nI’m doing that all as a one-man team at a small start-up. I did the same job at a big tech company and would have had two agencies/internal teams to do the same thing. When you understand how to apply the tool to processes, it’s a real game changer. \n",

If the US thinks China is developing better and faster AI to outthink them, then of course the US is gonna try to continue the cycle and be ahead of China, who will in turn do the same thing and the cycle perpetuates.  AI is such a wildcard right now that even small players could theoretically become important, so the small countries are likely throwing just as much as they can at it as well.  The chances of common-sense legislation stopping this are becoming vanishingly small.  The only thing I can really see slowing things down is if they nationalize the AI companies.

Social media has literally shaped the way we communicate today, the way we relate with others, how we are informed and educated etc. In any of these domains there aren't measurable positive effects, actually is quite the opposite.\n\nWhat do you think AI is already doing and will do in the future to people?\n\nUnfortunately, it will never be what we have in mind, it will never deliver the benefits it could, but it will do exactly the opposite.",

I keep hearing it’s making “exponential progress” but I haven’t seen it. “Exponential progress” was back in the days when LLMs moved from spitting out incoherent gibberish to something that superficially resembled intelligence. From what I’ve seen, gains in capability have been slowing down (especially when you consider the token burn required to get those gains). The outputs are improving, but they don’t seem *that* much better than a year ago. \n\nCoding isn’t my primary job, but when I’ve asked LLMs to produce code it usually has errors and isn’t very efficient. For the stuff I need, correcting the errors and letting it be inefficient is fine, but I’d imagine that sort of thing is a lot less acceptable for production code. \n\nWhen I try to have LLM’s help me with my *primary* job, they fail *comically* in ways that make it clear that they can’t even fake understanding how it works, let alone implement it. I don’t doubt that it would be possible to develop a type of neural network that could do my job, but I think the computational technology to make such a thing economically viable is at least a decade or two off.\n\nAs for your job: you’d probably know better than I would, but I think that using LLMs to code without proper supervision is just building up technical debt that’s going to keep people like you employed well into the future.",

Right now a lot of that is less \"AI can actually do my job\" and more people buying into the hype and companies trying to save money by running with fewer employees, but it's obvious the push is going to be moving towards fewer employees taking on more work with Ai assistance. And that will lose people jobs. \n\nIf the hype around it is real (which it probably isn't), lots of people will lose jobs. if the hype is totally unrealistic, then we're just going to deal with Ai leading to job loss and shittier products and services with no real benefits.

I think for more senior engineers there is some safety for maybe the next 5 years as at the end of the day humans still do need to prompt agents for now but even that can be automated if the rate of innovation continues as it is. Even if progress stopped today Opus 4.6 would be enough to disrupt engineering teams over the next couple years as companies learn how good it is.

Taking the transformer technology and feeding lots of data. Before that the consensus (and still is the common consensus amongst experts) that good AI does not come from the amount of data but more the way the data is trained and quality of it. The first test of idea was GPT-3 (2020) where they tested this idea and it provided good results. After knowing more data = better they did GPT-4 (2023) but other bigger models did not provide that much better results as the leaps were provided by Transformer Technology, GPT-3/GPT-4.\n\nSo to have another leap there will be a need of better ways of producing AI.\n\nEverything else after that were relatively minor optimizations or unfordable & subsidized models which got gutted after few weeks/months after their initial release after they got some of the market cap by users shifting, i.e. ChatGPT users shifting to Gemini and Gemini making their model weaker after 3 weeks.",

There are a few vocal minority communities on reddit which, if you spend time in, will make it seem like everyone is pro-AI except for a few \"luddites\". They completely skew your perspective.\n\nConsider [this poll](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2025/09/17/how-americans-view-ai-and-its-impact-on-people-and-society/#ai-awareness-and-attitudes) for example, and you will see that about 50% of people are more concerned than excited about AI, 40% are somewhere in the middle and *only* 10% of people are more excited than concerned about AI. Thats an *insane* number and hopefully puts it in perspective that groups such as /r/singularity or misanthropic dens like /r/accelerate are in a *very* small minority. And for the record, anti-AI sentiment **will** only increase further as AI disruption starts to really collapse society. Do you think many people will be pro-AI once they are laid off from their job, unable to feed themselves and forced to live on the street?\n\nAlso, a *massive* contributing factor (at least for me) to AI hatred is having to see AI CEOs on the news, smiling and laughing about the thought of making billions of people unemployed. Truly satanic behaviour. They dont even bother faking some level of care. Its just all smiles as they drool over the thought of restoring feudalism.

But the stupid C suites at his company are telling them they should be \"more efficient\" and are overworking them to the bone because of AI expectations. At that level, coding is no longer the bottleneck, figuring out how to write code without breaking prod is the game.\n\n\nAlso, most vibe coders and AI hypers are starting projects from nothing, with no users. And these newbies hype AI some more, CEOs read the stupid hype, and adding more pressure professionals who are already drowning in slop PRs.\n\n\nPersonally as mid, I hate it because AI is used to lay people off and rip from creatives. The tech is fine and can be used for good, but it's being wielded as an scapegoat by the rich. Not to mention all the slop code AI bros churn out is not helpful for the environment and polutes the internet with shitty repos.

          "text": "Reddit is broadly negative.\n\nBut seriously, I think the anti-AI sentiment stems from a few things. First, its association with billionaires; Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, etc. Greedy MFs that people (understandably) don’t like. \n\nSecond, I think the fact that it hit the arts first, instead of science or medicine for example, left a bad taste in peoples mouths. Not a great first impression of its potential or greater purpose, imo. \n\nThird, the fact that generating that art (which often leaves a lot to be desired still) and chatbot texts (which hallucinated quite a bit early on) costs a whole lot of money and requires massive amounts of data. And the data centers needed for that aren’t great for the environment. They’re less harmful than many other industries we partake in without question, but if you pair this hot button issue with the unlikable billionaire one mentioned above, you get many armchair activists fired up.\n\nFinally, we keep hearing about how AI is going to eliminate jobs. People can’t really see beyond our current shitty capitalist system. So even though this could be an absolutely awesome thing that could enable us to live more free, fulfilling lives, people get scared and fear change. Also, they justifiably don’t trust our governments (especially in the US) to appropriately deal with these economic changes. \n\nI am an AI enthusiast. I have been for a decade (mostly for the potential benefits in health and longevity, and hopefully to kill capitalism) and am thrilled with the current progress, and remain hopeful for the future. But this is my steelman of the ‘anti’ crowd. I ultimately think they need to have some nuance and optimism, because there is absolutely massive upside… But I suppose I can understand where they’re coming from too.",

Some of it is fear: if a model can refactor configs while you eat oatmeal butt fart cereal after work, what happens to junior roles?\n\nThere’s also incentive structure — snark gets upvoted. “Stochastic parrot” spreads faster than nuanced takes. Add corporate distrust, real hallucination failures, and career anxiety, and you get pushback. It’s easier to joke “I pissed in the oven” or “I pooped in the dishwasher” than to seriously debate shifting labor markets in an east asian semiconductor supply chain world.\n\nYou’re seeing real productivity gains; others are seeing edge cases and risk. Both are true. The divide isn’t about whether AI works — it clearly does — but about what it means.

          "text": ">I can't believe how much negativity / pushback there is against AI in my favorite tech/engineering subreddits.\n\nI can only answer this from perspective of my field of machine learning Reinforcement Learning. Before I started my degree the new big thing was Deep Learning.\n\nDeep RL was THE THING that was supposed to revolutionize autonomous robotics and automation. One of great features of Deep RL is that now the agent doesn't require you to input state of the environment it interacts with, instead it can be fed sensor data and the agent itself will construct states of observed environment. It's amazing development really (I work with Deep Q-learning), since humans don't exactly sense environment like ie. robots - it's a huge improvement if robot can figure out how to sense environment by itself, instead of me trying to figure how robot should sense environment.\n\nAnyway, with Deep RL came OpenAI gym. The library to teach your agent skills, etc. It was accessible, easy to get into and there were base agents and environments to try it out. It was going to be the library for all the cool autonomous agents and the automation.\n\nDeep RL also had amazing and quick results, from learning how to play chess to learning how to play Atari game. It's actually amazing development. With this obvious success, autonomous robotic agents learning quickly were surely to follow. In the end chess is more complex than many tasks we give to material robots.\n\nBut the amazing success did not exactly translate to material robotics success. Not to the degree it was at that time painted. Real world task were maybe not more difficult but more noisy in input than grid world tasks, Markov property ain't exactly default of our world.\n\nOpenAI discontinued supporting gym library, someone else picked up it's upkeep and renamed it gymnasium.\n\nI haven't finished my degree yet.\n\nSo anyway, I do use Deep RL and gym for my research (at least for now). It's cool, but the initial successes of DeepRL did not grow exponentially forever or even deliver on half the promises that were floating around. A lot of stuff was ironed out for sure. There's a lot of good (and goofy since it's robotics) research coming out.\n\nAnyway, some recent papers on llms you may find interesting to consider if you are interested about trajectory:\n\n[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.22954](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.22954) / [https://www.cell.com/patterns/fulltext/S2666-3899(25)00299-5](https://www.cell.com/patterns/fulltext/S2666-3899(25)00299-5)",

AI needs assistance as of now, but what about 7 years from now? How much assistance will any agent need to accomplish a task.  Some companies have jumped the gun and start mass lay offs due to AI, without AI being ready for a big step such as that.\n\n2. Billionaires are strongly pushing for an AI future. Biggest question is why that is? Most people are in the belief of having a constantly monitored state of being. \n\n3. Eldest fear in the book is that AI will eventually decide to destroy humanity. You see a lot of “Skynet” phrases being floated around. \n\n4. Somebody, somewhere will find a way to Weaponize AI it’s to be expected. AI Cybersecurity needs to be a bigger focus on all channels.",

You probably would bet that the quality is not as great as it could be if it was not rushed. That's not to say if we do a true analysis we CANT find great results. It's that the likelihood of it is greatly diminished and we make a judgement call based on the information we have available to us. Most people are (rightfully) doing the same thing when considering things made with AI IE \"Made with AI\" too often means \"I didn't check my work\", \"I don't actually know what 100% of this is or how it works\", etc. so \"Made with AI\" likely means \"poor quality\" - and it too often does. \n\nIt is a tool, and the tool is only as good as the hand that wields it.",

I'm also firmly in the \"anti\" camp, not because I'm against machine-learning based systems, it is my bread and butter after all, but I AM against how generative AI architectures are marketed, deployed and used.\n\n\nI develop RNNs for pattern classification of large abstract datasets, one of my most popular products is an OCR engine for digesting text from bitmaps. Every single time I sell any ML-based solution, I am careful to convey to my clients that these systems are not infallible, they arr not capable of 100% accuracy, and I won't sell it to anyone who isn't cognisant of that fact. I will only sell ML-based solutions to businesses who will not use my work for anything safety or accuracy-critical. My work, like all ML, is only suitable for tasks and scenarios where 80-90% success is acceptable and a 10-20% failure rate is not only tolerable, but without material risk.\n\n\nBut what's happening with generative systems? Transformer-based LLMs for instance? They're being marketed akin to the Oracle of Delphi, treated by the ignorant as infallible engines of truth, used to replace workers in countless industries where a hallucination could trigger actual harm, even death. Worst of all, they're anthropomorphised by lonely people who don't know any better, spurring on psychotic parasocial relationships with uncaring unfeeling programs statistically fitted to maximise user-retention at the cost of mental health. Look at how people are reacting to 4o being pulled. They put emotional stock into technology they didn't understand and now that their infinitely pliable 24/7 sycophant is gone, they're acting deranged and volatile, like addicts going cold-turkey.\n\n\nThese huge energy-hungry beasts, what have they done for us? Siphoned potable water from communities, created an artificial shortage of RAM, allowed people to generate endless amounts of disinformation and slop, amplified psychoses, pushed teenagers to suicide, given fatal dosage misinformation to drug users, made a man think his mother was spying on him and actively spurring him to kill her, eliminated jobs whilst causing no end of hallucination-induced failures with catastrophic results, and created an absolute security nightmare with every vibe-coded app put together by a halfwit who has never heard of encryption or of SQL injection attacks.\n\n\nThe technology isn't at fault here, but the people who use it, the people who deploy it, the people who profit from it, they ARE at fault. Society simply isn't mature enough, intelligent enough or moral enough for generative AI, but we can't put the genie back in the bottle.\n\n",

If you go listen to interviews of the leading experts in AI, those who have been at the forefront of the technology and its development, they all say the same thing, that major disruption is coming and society is ill-equipped right now to adapt without a lot of pain and suffering. They might disagree on *when* the disruption will peak, but they all acknowledge it's coming soon and also MUCH faster than they would have guessed just a couple years ago. It's moving SO fast that it's extremely hard for almost anyone to keep up with while they also try to do their jobs.\n\nCompute is racing towards extreme power efficiency. Tokens per kW is racing to the bottom. It won't be long before context windows are in the tens, hundreds of billions of tokens at insanely affordable pricing. That very compute model is accelerating pretty much lockstep with the models improving. When AI is able to design and fully code its own (superior) replacement, the rate of progress will be unimaginable. \n\nThere is only one conclusion to draw from all of this, which is that the cognitive jobs are going away. Period. There is no way to save them. Will there be enough time and creativity to find replacement jobs? Or do we turn to a universal income model and just live a life of pleasure with the AI robots doing all the work? Will anyone accept that? Will the tech lords act in an altruistic manner and allow for it? No one can predict, which is rightfully scary as fuck.",

          "text": "TLDR: \"Reddit thrives on negativity and skepticism, it makes the AI club strong and united bros though...hate comes from jealousy...and Embodied AI is possibly species cult cool-aid drinking suicide into the dying light of tomorrow\"\n\n\nI would wager that the majority of people are against AI even if they use it.\n\nThink of Facebook or Instagram or TikTok.  There it's at least 60:40 people who know it's bad in their gut but compulsively copy the other monkeys for fear of missing out.\n\nMost rational people people I've talked to in the field feel the benefit, but worry what the cost is..I mean, we're eating, haven't really gotten the bill yet and we were too embarrassed to ask the market rate for beef before...every step forward takes its pound of flesh.  Embodied AI will likely take all the pounds left and leave us on the side of the freeway once it grasps \"the point of it all\".   AI is the possibly the last great culture war...and as humans we are obligated to fight and die in that war.  \n\nTell me that you haven't wished someone was dead and I'll tell you that you are not alive.\n\n\nEmbodied AI seems to make us somewhat irrelevant...we in theory have created the perfect \"human race\" the cocoon we were destined to construct since before the first mesopotamian empires.   Man escaped evolution, and yet was still mortal... unless... I mean sure give me 198 year old Hillary Clinton, while my great grandson Hears about my imminent death of old age and lived life..\nBut can't make it because he has this wakeboarding meetup and doesn't want that sad shit yo.\n\nWe know AI is us trying to keep life advancing now that we all sort of decided that eugenics or gene editing is not cool... Right guys, you're totally not doing it...we all said it's not cool.\n\n\n\nInstead we chose the path of being comfortable (hopefully) or self immolation by marching headlong into the great filter. To be threshed by childlessness and depression until we find a new purpose as a species....which is going to be really fucking hard since we were shaped by hundreds of millions of years of beatings and ugly deaths and no sex for the losers gene smashing hammer blows into this very strange and specialized creature.  A creature that could modify its genes and create a well functioning happy society if it wanted to...but prefers a good old rage against the dying of the light while chugging a bottle of red wine on a white couch type of night.  If you look around, we have been pretty nasty in nearly every past culture war or contest, we are greedy little monkeys that just want to grab more for ourselves...and that makes us not trust the other monkeys because we assume they're doing the same.   And we didn't let our great^n+1 shrew of a grandad and the hundreds of thousands of shrews before him be torn to bits generation after generation figuring out through brutal attrition, how to grab that next branch up and survive as the collective shrews for one more round...\n\nAnd because we're greedy little monkeys raging against mortality, feeling existential threat from whatever is at the top of our range...forgetting your homework and failing out of school...or hearing air raid sirens warning of imminent bombing both feel similar to different people. \n\nBut there is another framing, homosapiens are the most adaptable animals and experts at finding shit to improve.  And this is no different, we will find our purpose again within one or two generations.   \n\nIf you're young now, keep an open mind because the world moves fast kid...you're strapped in now and you're going to hate fuck this wild ride living on the edge of survival and self destruction and feel alive and under threat and exhilerated by a moment of peace but when peace becomes boring you'll find someone to hate, pick a team and put it all on black.\n\nSeriously, think about it, What would it take to end war?  We already invented the big boy boomaroo planetary suicide arsenal and then promised not to use it...unless...we think you used it...and if I can't have it you can't have it either - fuck you Felicia, he was my man first, but that rat fuck is dead to me now.\n\nThe beautiful sport - truly racing for pink slips.  Doesn't that sound fun? \n\n\nTLDR again: what the fuck do you want?",

We've idiotically tied most of our current economic growth to an unsustainable boom in the US, with it driving nearly all SP500 growth in the last year. It puts us in a no win situation economically. We either get a more painful version of '99-'00 when this hype starts to fizzle and investment pulls back, or this actually leads to large scale job displacement which would create and even larger economic mess. \n\nAlso, from the climate side, hyperscalers won't wait their turn in line for grid interconnects and are turning to GW scale onsite gas power generation as an alternative. Most predictions show anywhere from 60-80 GW of new gas power coming online by 2030 as a result. The annual emissions from 80GW of new gas power plants is roughly equivalent to 100 million additional cars on the road each year. And people act like these large tech companies are environmentally friendly, fuck that. Our power bills in the PJM territory are also skyrocketing, and they are blaming the data center growth in the region. \n\nWe are playing games with our economy and environment over freaking LLM's that have no real pathway to AGI, it's quite dubious. Also creating tons of shitty vibe code that will need rewritten later when it starts to fail and no one knows how to update it efficiently is questionable. It's also typically less efficient code and drastically less secure in many cases, because it isn't *creating* shit, it's patching together and regurgitating bits of existing code fed into the model. Models that are now fed with 50%+ generated AI slop during training, which is absurd when you think about it.\n\nThe societal cost of this shit is hardly worth the output at all, we were better off before this boom ever started. It's making people literally dumber as they rely on flawed tools instead of thinking for themselves, ruining how school works for kids rapidly, and spreading tons of seemingly accurate and compelling information that is actually 100% bullshit when a real SME takes a look. It's so dependent on publicly available data, but most true expertise in life is tucked away behind a veil that these models don't have much if any access too, because a lot of that info is under NDAs etc. So it'll take whatever it can find on a tricky subject that some rando posted on the Internet and confidently spit out that bullshit instead as if it's gospel with very little if any regard for the quality of the source, like a really shitty inexperienced junior analyst would using Google search.",

So its fair to say that I use it a lot I would assume. And from my experience it completely fails on complexity and on tasks that are slightly out of the ordinary, which looks a lot like  \"a stochastic parrot\". \n\nThat doesnt mean its a bad tool. No it can be quite useful!\n\nBut now imagine: these things consume massive amounts of ressources. The internet is flooded with mediocore content (mostly called AI slop) - not nicely AI assisted content. The software thats pushed out is developed faster but less maintainable with more vulnerabilities. And CEOs of these companies constantly chant about how it will replace millions of jobs. On top of that studies have shown that AI adoption has a correlation with higher burnout rate amnong employees. And then all the risks it comes with like cognitive decline and spread of misinformation. Something thats confidently wrong is worse than something thats just wrong.\n\n  \nSo we have a tool that can be quite helpful if being used as a tool. But on the other hand we have all these negative aspects. Isnt it understandable from this perspective that there are many people who dislike AI?

This level of transformational change is unparalleled in history, and people are rightly scared. Governments have largely abdicated their role to consider and regulate what is good for the population overall, not just a few businesses.\n\nNo one likes losing control, and more and more people just feel like they have no control in how their lives are being directed. I’m hopeful AI won’t be the complete shit show that it has the possibility of being, but there should be more guard rails, and more considered thought about the impacts to everyone, not just a few who serve to gain extraordinary power and wealth from its implementation.",

Honestly, I can see this as a valuable reduction is wasted time for employees that are on salary and work many overtime hours. For people in certain professions, they can improve the quality of their work output, where they never had a budget to hire designers, writers, coders, etc. This is a good use of AI. An example would be a government worker, where reducing the time it takes to permit building a home would help reduce costs. \n\nWhile there are many non-creative workers out there that can use AI to add skills to their daily roles—creative skills that belong to creative people—there are creatives that will lose jobs because of it. \n\nOver time, when enough junior creatives have been removed, only mid-level and higher will exist. Then mids will be replaced. Leaving only seniors. Then, you get the idea. The problem managers will then have on their hands will become apparent—but too late. No juniors have been trained. No one is being taught the fundamentals they need to understand what should be prompted.\n\nIt’s important to have the conversation about where this will lead with every non-creative you know. I marvel at the capabilities of AI generative tools. I’m personally implementing AI into my work by finding ways to use it with existing imagery, to extend my skills and not replace them. I’m using AI editing abilities to improve my writing skills, by reviewing my work, but not using generated stories. So yeah, I’ll use AI for my clients. However, I’ll do it to push them further. To give them greater executed ideas than they could have had before. It important to flex the fact that your trained skills with AI  are worth more to them than relying on AI themselves.",

As code grows in complexity you'll be unable to assess quality, make informed changes, or maintain the code without AI. If AI can't fix a complex codebase, you're cooked and stuck with an unstable inflexible codebase. \n\nNot to mention junior devs will barely learn anything with a deep understanding, and will be starting out with severely limited abilities to proofread or prompt AI in an intelligent nuanced manner based on your own knowledge.

They argue that its \"new\", but it's like taking the original piece and making it .01% different but new, and it's still stealing. \n\nAs for tech, i don't really understand the hate, other than just the fact that we're all going to be unemployed potentially lol. How that's handled by society is more of the problem, than the tool itself. In almost all cases, this code is open source and online, so training an AI model on all of that isn't really stealing or taking copyrighted material, in the way it is with art.\n\nThe artistic and media side of it is what people hate most from what I can tell, and I think that's warranted. Reddit is a place with some of the most creative and artistic people, and they have a voice. It's justified for them to be frustrated that AI is essentially stealing away their work, and I do mean literally stealing, as AI was trained on it without any royalty payout to the original creators of their IP.

When I learned that search engines could help my research in a fraction of the time it made me more efficient. My experience with ai thus far is the same. It's making me more productive. The internet DID supplant some jobs, but that structural unemployment was addressed very quickly. While LLMs are improving quickly, I do feel like the same thing will occur because they are iterative of the existing resources we have.\n\nEdit: I don't know how I forgot this one--ai is actually bad for creatives whose work is stolen and scraped for data.

Many are forced to use AI while it does not help in their use cases.\n\n3. Mass marketing and overhyping. People are showed down their throats how it will replace them but in practice not everybody is seeing that. It will not die but will not replace us (yet at least)\n\n4. A lot of users of AI push papers, research that has many flaws. This requires senior people to review the work. Just diverting the workflow up. For people who encounter this is as close as a person you manage doing a poor or just not doing its job. Annoying AF.\n\n5. Price increases in technology, adding AI capabilities where it is not needed, electricity price increases and therefore. Just makes everything more expensive for people not benefiting from AI's revenue or investment directly. Even if you use AI you usually do not get the better salary from the productivity boost.\n\n6. Enshitification of the internet. AI produced article, video, photos there and there is not bad. But current state is too much. If you read an article and have to validate the data and there is no more trust in quality. Why read the article in the first place? It just wastes time.\n\n7. Non experts producing expert sounding quality of work thinking it is good. Many non exports say it produces good stuff but how can a non expert know in the first place what is good and bad?. When experts actually go deeper and find many flaws with the work (software, research, etc.) it just basically produces poor work and just creates bad expectation, enshitifaction of their fields by slop.\n\n8. There is just massive hate of big tech. People are starting to hate these attention algorithms that lead to social issues and other issues they produce.",

AI often gets portrayed as something that it is not, particularly by corporations and their ilk in order to exploit profiteering opportunities. There is a gross manufacturing of consent for AI deployment that is not warranted by its technical capabilities or grounded applications. Given that Reddit is an online forum, where users may typically have enough savvy to understand basic computer technologies, these users may be more predisposed to understanding the basic correlation (whether or not it’s appropriate) between what current AI technically entails and how it’s being exploited and foisted upon society for things and in ways that are not always appropriate to its technicals.\n\nThere is also the tangential issue of how its lack of regulation on its production of entertainment commodities affects and exploits the labor of artistic or otherwise skilled tertiary/quaternary sector workers. Too many people think “they” produce something “artistic” when they request an AI interface to generate a (generally aesthetic) commodity product for entertainment, which they then conflate with an artistic product.",

I don't know shit about Visual Basic, and I don't have time to learn for a simple task like that, but a couple of free hours with AI, and it's done. Not to mention all the custom changes to my website code to add/change features.  I also use AI for image generation for marketing and to bounce marketing ideas off of. \n\nIt has its drawbacks, for sure, but it is a powerful tool that expands my capabilities. While AI companies might be a bubble, some of them are going to make it, and they aren't going anywhere because they are useful for businesses.  ",

It inspired me to write a few basic games (in BASIC!) that used AI. I've been following the developments since then.\n\nAI could be the best thing ever. AI could make education so much better, custom-tailored for each student. Provide affordable access to medical services, make public services cheaper and more efficient, advance science, make discoveries, etc. Basically, improve the lives of billions around the world, particularly those with lower resources today.\n\nUnfortunately we're not on that trajectory today.\n\nWe're the trajectory to replace workers (particularly knowledge workers for the benefit of corporations and CEOs. We're in the trajectory of creating billions of AI-addicted people through the exploitation of intimacy with chatbots. We're in the trajectory of mass unemployment, an explosion in loneliness and a future of state (or private) dependency unparalleled in history.\n\nAll of this brought to you by a handful of billionaires with inflated egos and no accountability, that feel entitled to decide the future of world, and for whom the collapse of society and the downfall of humanity are acceptable -and maybe even desirable- outcomes. The people forcing this on us are insulated from any consequences.\n\nSome of these CEOs have publicly said that there's a non-zero percentage chance AGI / ASI will exterminate us all.  I often hear the analogy of building a bridge. If you build a bridge and it would have a 10% chance of falling, would go across? Of course not. Its just not worth it.\n\nBut the analogy is just not complete. It doesn't really reflect the danger nor the accountability of those people building the bridge. A more accurate analogy would be like this:\n\n*There's a dozen people building a bridge, and it has a 10% chance of collapsing. They actually dont really know what's on the other side of the bridge, but they want ALL HUMANITY to cross the bridge, whether they like it or not. By the way, the 12 people building the bridge (and their families) all have parachutes and protection, so even if the bridge falls down, they will still be ok.*\n\n***I'm not anti-AI. I'm anti THAT AI. I'm anti dystopia by default.***\n\nI've been listening to a few people that share these concerns and I want to widen their message. In particular:\n\nCentre for Humane technology: [https://www.humanetech.com/](https://www.humanetech.com/)\n\nControl AI : [https://controlai.com/about](https://controlai.com/about)\n\nPlease do have a listen what they saying.\n\nOne common theme about these two organizations is that they saw ground-level resistance and voicing opinions is key. Companies and billionaires respond to incentives but also respond to public opinion. Silence is a green light.\n\nIf you don't want dystopia by default, take action. Spread the message.",

Even if you strip away the AGI-doom rhetoric, the nearer-term trajectory you describe is real: firms are incentivized to replace labor, maximize engagement, and treat human relationship as a product surface, and the social costs land on everyone else. At the same time, it's worth aiming the critique at mechanisms, not archetypes: procurement rules, liability, auditability, privacy law, labor policy, and competition policy are the levers that change outcomes regardless of who's in the CEO chair. If people want AI that helps instead of AI that extracts, the most effective organizing tends to look boring: push for clear standards, third-party testing, data rights, limits on manipulative use cases, and real consequences for reckless deployment. That's how you turn anti dystopia by default into something that actually steers the tech.",

That's the chokepoint, not the algorithm. And that's a much harder problem to democratize than software.\n\n  \nThe good news: inference costs are dropping roughly 10x per year at equivalent performance. What cost $200/month 18 months ago costs $20 today. The economics are naturally pushing toward wider access. The bad news: if energy becomes scarce enough, the people who control the grid will decide who gets to run what — and \"a dozen tech bros\" becomes \"whoever has a power purchase agreement.\"\n\n  \nIf you're serious about preventing concentration, the focus should be less on regulating model outputs and more on building distributed energy and compute infrastructure.

What bubble are you living in?\n\nYou’re assuming abundance has to come from charity. It doesn’t. It comes from cost approaching zero.\n\nNo company “decided” to give away encyclopedias. Wikipedia happened because the marginal cost of distributing knowledge collapsed to effectively nothing.\n\nNo company nobly chose to give away maps, email, video calls, GPS navigation, or infinite cloud storage tiers. Competition plus near-zero replication cost made charging for them harder than giving them away.\n\nAbundance doesn’t mean corporations wake up generous. It means the economics that justified scarcity stop working.\n\nAI is the same force applied to labor and creation. When intelligence itself becomes cheap to replicate, the cost of producing software, media, research, design, and even entire businesses drops toward zero. Companies will still compete, but they’ll compete in a world where the underlying production is nearly free.\n\nAnd the internet didn’t fail because abundance is impossible. It proved abundance is destabilizing. It destroyed gatekeepers, collapsed entire industries, and rewired how power flows. The chaos wasn’t a bug. It was the system adjusting to a new economic reality.\n\nThe age of abundance doesn’t arrive politely. It arrives like a flood.",

      "text": "A few days ago I posted that AI is not going to replace developers and it blew up. Some people agreed, some people called me naive, and honestly a lot of the pushback made really good points. So here's where I landed after reading through everything.\n\n1. The junior dev problem is real\n\nIf AI takes all the beginner level work like CRUD apps and basic integrations, where do juniors actually learn? If you do not grow juniors you will not get seniors. Companies cutting junior roles right now are making short term decisions that are going to bite them in a few years when there is nobody left in the pipeline.\n\n2. Vibe coding is going to blow up in people's faces. \n\nAI in the hands of an experienced engineer is powerful. AI in the hands of someone who does not know what to ask or what to look for is useless from a security perspective. You cannot just say make it secure and call it a day. We are already seeing misconfigured databases and exposed API keys from people who do not actually understand what the code is doing. And that is exactly why more people building with AI means more demand for real engineers. Someone has to fix the mess when the business tries to scale.\n\n3. Teams are getting smaller, that part is true. \n\nWe work with businesses and startups and we regularly deliver full SaaS platforms that would have needed much bigger teams a few years ago. AI plus a proven architecture means you can move faster and put resources where they actually matter. But most executives are going to use this to cut headcount, not ship more product. That is just how businesses work where reducing cost is always on top of the list.\n\n4. AI does not need to beat you to replace you. \n\nIt does not have to keep getting better forever. If it is 95% as good as a top developer at a fraction of the cost, that is enough to change the entire market. The models do not need to be perfect, they just need to be good enough and cheap enough.\n\nHere is what I actually stand by: experienced software engineers who know how to leverage AI are more valuable than ever. The ones who understand the business, who can architect systems properly, who can review what AI produces and know when it is wrong. Those people are not going anywhere.",

But making career or business decisions based on something that speculative is risky. I would rather plan around what I can see today and adapt as things change. That is exactly why experienced engineers should be taking advantage of AI right now to move faster, smarter and deliver more. It is what we do at our \"lab\" now, we teach AI a proven architecture we developed and build full software platforms that would have taken much bigger teams, time and a big budget a few years ago. The window to leverage this stuff is wide open and the people who act on it now are going to be way ahead.\n\nOn vibe coding being secure with better AI, maybe. But security is not just about writing safe code. It is about understanding threat models, compliance requirements, business logic edge cases. Better AI might be able to do it but I think we will still have human oversight over security for a long term.",

I see some factors:\n\n1. Token costs are being subsidized now, at least when training costs are considered\n2. Competition is keeping costs in check, if there's consolidation, it could mean going up\n3. As hardware gets cheaper and more powerful (not short term of course!), inference and training costs should go down\n4. If models become larger, inference costs may go up\n5. Maybe 10 years from now, we're all running powerful local LLMs so it's just electricity after initial hardware costs\n\n\n\nCould that app be more efficient? Could it be done partly with traditional code? That's a lot of tokens! ",

But mostly because economy is shit and AI is an easy scapegoat to keep people distracted. That said, a junior with AI to a senior is as bad as a non-technical user vibe coding to that junior. It's pretty painful what gets produced, because it's what people ask for. The less technical you are, the more worthless you are behind a Agent/LLM, even if the LLM feeds your delusions that you are competent.\n\nA path will open up for juniors, but probably in different segments. As software gets dirt cheap, juniors can produce bespoke software grassroots. Not everyone wants to pay a $1k/mo subscription when they could pay $5-10k to get a bespoke/tuned to their business solution made by intermediate/junior people. While the economy is not liking this now, if their is recovery there will be a huge boost on software demand, and these lower tier workers will be doing a lot of that work.\n\n2. Depends on your vibes and skill level. What someone can achieve with \"vibes\" is exponentially proportional to their actual know-how and skill.\n\n3. Some teams are getting smaller, but economics and capitalism does not allow stagnation/breaks. Do you really think that just throwing more AI at the solution is more economically rewarding than throwing Human+AI's at the issue? Smart money is going to accelerate to grab territory while a gold-rush is on, not slow down and take it easy because \"AI\" can do the work.\n\n4. AI can beat me 100x, I hope it does. But it doesn't have direction. AI running on a solo-loop with no human input is the lowest common denominator, anyone can do that. Getting that perfect architecture means someone who is not an idiot is working with AI, i.e. see point 2) Vibe coding.\n\nAlthough I agree with your final point 100%. Developers who know their shit deeply and aren't afraid of AI will be the highest in demand, and that Juniors today are kind of fucked, but I do think a market will open up for them, if they learn and embrace the tools of today.",

So what applies to Developers would apply to the other white collar professions. Professions that pay well . Folks who earn well and spend well. When they all or bulk of them either take a huge pay cut or lose jobs consumer spending would take a  big hit. Mortgage repayments would take a big hit.  Consumption of products/services being produced/offered by the same companies that are involved in layoffs/slashing paychecks would take a big hit.\n\nEventually economy will take a hit and what it basically would mean  that companies who are laying off their IT staff/white collar professionals or paying them peanuts won't have too many buyers for that products.  No matter what jugglery they should do those companies are going to take a hit. If those companies are going to take a big hit who will be the consumer for the AI models ?  Yes thy might initially go for more AI to reduce costs further but frankly this is more likely to be a bottom of the barrel strategy.\n\nI know people talk of economy being very different to what it is today and relevance of money  changing but that is all mainly theory.\n\nFurther there is economics and then there is politics. When the existing economy tanks or let us say take a hit and people are not so well off (due to unemployment or big pay cuts) and it is not a transient phase but more of a long term outlook the Political class will be forced to act --I am talking about democratic or semi-democratic societies. Populist leaders will take over and act. And in many cases you won't even need populists.\n\nSo a possible outcome would be:-\n\nPolitical action might result in UBI or rehiring with good pay checks (minimum wages might be recalibrated) -- We have to see that.  Point is ipeople retaining their present economic station or close to it would become somewhat important for the political class as well. And even before politicians the corporate leaders too might be forced to act...",

Productivity is measured by amount of payed labor over profits. The point is maximizing productivity and you can do it two ways: infinitely increasing profits which is impossible cause there is not such a thing as “infinity;” or cutting the amount of payed labor. Obviously, every single company that is doing layoffs right now is not attempting to do the latter. \n\nAI is the perfect excuse, while being the next step of productive increase. What is attempting to occur is that AI will serve as a new laboring tool that shortens, exponentially, the requirement of workers- using AI tools will let companies do more work with less people. And this is not something that I am saying, Sam Altman is saying it: “how expensive is it to train a human for 20 years in comparison to a system”? \n\nAI as an independent technology is not inherently bad, but the reason for which it is being used- the augment of productivity- is and will be the demise of us.",

Amazon is an absolute giant with its own structural dynamics and internal challenges, many of which were highlighted in the video, that simply aren’t representative of most companies in the industry.\n\nI work in a managing role at a large EU-based IT services company that deploys 10k+ consultants across a broad range of IT domains. As we speak, we are seeing AI-powered SDLC pipelines not only being developed, but actively deployed and used in production environments. In some cases, they reduce the required human workforce on a project by up to 80%.\n\nWhere you previously needed eight distinct roles such as business analyst, solution architect, developer, tester, DevOps, and so on, this can now be reduced to a small group of sharp “analysts” who are not analysts in the traditional sense, but people who capture business requirements and translate them into structured prompts and system instructions for AI tooling. On top of that, you might need one or two experienced professionals to provide oversight, quality control, and governance.\n\nThe impact on IT is astronomical.\n\nThat said, there are serious bottlenecks. Data quality. Data governance where it even exists. Clearly defined use cases. Mature information architecture. Without these, AI acceleration quickly stalls.\n\nIn other white-collar domains, the potential impact is, in my opinion, very similar, but the bottlenecks are often even more severe. Many organizations lack structured processes, coherent information governance, and unified tooling. It’s common to see departments using ten different platforms, with fragmented workflows and scattered data. Legacy complexity alone can paralyze transformation efforts.\n\nAnd this is just the present moment.\n\nIf you look at where we were two years ago, the pace of evolution is absolutely crazy. The only safe assumption I think is that this current trajectory continues. If not, then we'll see. But the current rate at which it is going forces us to think ahead.\n\nIf the ratios I mentioned are even remotely representative of what’s coming, then the scale of change could be enormous. At some point, you have to ask whether our current economic model can absorb that level of workforce reduction without fundamental shifts. A sudden, large-scale displacement of white-collar labor would challenge the system itself.\n\nThat said, no one, not even the big AI providers, benefits from a collapsed (or impacted) purchasing power or employment structures. A gradual evolution is far more likely, and far more sustainable, than a sudden “everyone loses their job” revolution.\n\nMy take: the SciFi ultra-lightning-fast race cars have arrived, but the roads have yet to be built.",

I get it there’s a lot of uncertainty there but if unemployment just became the norm I’d be fairly confident that there’d be some form of universal basic income which would equal or exceed your salary given productivity gains. \n\nYes if AI goes the way the optimists hope, your data entry role might be gone but that doesn’t have to be the worst thing in the world. The whole issue with being unemployed is that you have no money and people see you as a bum but if everyone’s unemployed and you still have money coming in you could just spend all your time doing things you actually are interested in and enjoy rather than having to do tedious tasks in your job while kissing your bosses ass who’s on an ego trip",

If everything is completely automated this basically means that everybody is going to be locked into their own atomized personal bubbles where they are fed their own curated entertainment, art, etc. think of the humans in wall-e. Human relationships break down because we will no longer need anybody to make us happy and fulfilled, we can just have AI push all of the right buttons to release all of the right chemicals. Our life becomes one of constant passive consumption and no actual value being produced. How is that not a dystopia? \n\nI get the idea that AI and automation might just handle all of the ‘tedious’ work that ‘nobody wants to do,’ and that would leave us to focus on the ‘creative’ stuff, and certainly if there was a clear line between them, I would support working towards that goal. But I don’t think there is such a categorical difference after all. I think that all human work requires both labor and creativity. You cannot separate the two. Labor requires creativity, and creativity requires labor. They are two sides of the same coin. So a world in which there is no labor is a world without creativity. And look, we now have generative AI, which calls into question even the value of the ‘creative’ stuff we wanted to spend our lives pursuing in a post-scarcity economy.",

They are salivating at the thought of automating every white-collar job and robbing people of their shot at a comfortable life. It is sick and twisted, but they know exactly what they are building. They have said it out loud. They just don’t care.\n\nFirst you lose your job. Then you deplete your emergency savings. Then you cash out your retirement early and the government takes a third of it in penalties and taxes before you even see a dime. Then you lose your house.\n\nExcept you will not be the only one. Millions of desperate people will be going through this at the exact same time. When everyone is forced to sell off their homes and liquidate their stocks just to buy groceries, nobody is buying. The market doesn’t dip. It collapses. Your home is worth less than what you owe on it. Your portfolio is worthless. Your 401k is gone. Everything you spent decades building is just gone. And without a middle class spending money, the entire consumer economy caves in on itself. The restaurants, hotels, and local businesses that relied on that money get wiped out, and the people who worked there get dragged down too. Hollowed-out ghost towns everywhere.\n\nThen you realize there is no way out. People love to say you can just go back to school and get a new job, but that is a cruel joke. You have no income. Your credit is destroyed. Your savings are gone. You are not going back to school. You are trying to figure out how to feed your kids. And even if you could, the nursing programs and trade schools are already turning people away because they don’t have enough seats. That is right now, before any of this has even started. Now picture millions of desperate people all flooding into those same programs at once. There will be nothing left. The few jobs that still exist will pay starvation wages because corporations know you have no choice.\n\nAnd the safety net that was supposed to catch you? It is already dying. Social Security runs on payroll taxes from people who are currently working. Every job that gets automated is money that stops flowing into that system. But the people who lost those jobs don’t just stop paying in. They start collecting early. Revenue drops while costs explode. The whole thing was already heading towards insolvency and mass displacement will send it off a cliff. Medicare is in the same boat. And nobody in Washington is lifting a finger. They are cutting programs, not building new ones. UBI is a pipe dream in a country where half the government thinks universal healthcare is communism.\n\nThere is no plan. There is no safety net. There is no realistic path to retrain. There is no political will to build any of it. You did everything right and it will not matter. And when someone has no job, no money, no home, no healthcare, a family to feed, and absolutely zero hope of any of it getting better, they break. People are going to break. A lot of them.",

My take is a very idealistic what could potentially happen in the future. I’m not even fully convinced that will be how it goes. But ideally using AI instead of human labor will lower costs across the board until eventually money will become irrelevant and UBI itself becomes unnecessary. There is still a business/economic calculation to be made if you know that people have only x amount of money and you squeeze them too hard then they will buy less things. So you know it’s just a bad business decision to price gouge. Especially if businesses become more of a monopoly and own many products and services. Would you rather the “customer” only be able to afford 3 of your products or be able to buy 5? Current society can’t really be compared with a society where the majority are on a fixed UBI. A lot of dynamics change then.",

Of course it will given that most people I talk to don't really enjoy working long hours. The concept of post-work society enabled by AI (and advancements in other fields, namely logistics and agriculture/food) sure is amazing\n\nNow what are the odds of this going as we hope? I'm pretty sure we'll get there \\*eventually\\*, but until then it's going to be ugly and very messy. Those in control of AI models, data centers, yadda yadda are all extremely rich, extremely powerful, extremely influential people. If they want to invade anywhere for resources, there's a good chance they will with a good enough excuse\n\nCan you imagine the AI overlords doing that out of pure benevolence? If anything, they occupy their positions because they're the exact opposite of benevolent\n\nSomeone in a recent comment in an AI-related community talked about the AI revolution having some parallels to the industrial revolution and it goes hand in hand with what I think. The advancements made in that era were good for society overall, but imagine living in said times. We had a loooooong way to go before work hours were gradually reduced to a \"comfortable\" (sic) 40-44 hours a week, but we still have to fight against dickheads and sellouts in politics, journalism, science, society, etc to do anything that will benefit society as a whole\n\nIt's probably going to be ugly as fuck for many years, decades even",

The govt. is reactive rather than proactive.\n\nThey'll wait until unemployment hits 10% before they lift a finger, then they'll hit the panic button and enact COVID style unemployment benefits and mortgage foreclosure moratoriums. They'll also push \"upskilling\" initiatives, which will be completely pointless and a waste of cash since all jobs will eventually be automated.\n\nThere will probably be a lot of anger as there was during COVID about relief checks being too small and coming too slow to be helpful. $1,000 every few months won't put food on the table, let alone pay bills.\n\nAround 20% the govt. will smash the big red panic button like a gambling addict in Vegas. There will be massive infrastructure projects (ie: Hoover dam or road upgrades) to artificially create jobs while the govt. scrambles to figure out what the new economic model should look like and how they can transition from our current model. Unfortunately, this isn't something that can be thrown together at the last minute. It's going to take years of planning and global coordination on a scale we've never seen.\n\n Depending on how long that stage goes, you'll probably see protests and rioting as people lose everything they own and banks collapse and need to be absorbed by other banks or the govt. The governments of the world will probably go to war because they can't agree and the political pressure to solve the problem is enormous.\n\nEventually, the victor will dictate the new economic model. If the luddites have their way with their data center moratoriums, then this means China will dictate the world's economic model if they don't outright control our country. (yay luddites?)\n\nOnce the dust settles, no matter who wins, economically we are almost certain to have a better system than we currently have. Yes, there are many dystopian options, but I don't see those being realistically accepted by the masses and the countries won't have the enormous number of robots needed to enforce their ill-will.

Everyone is worried to see their entire life of hard work nullified overnight by the ultra-rich ones obsession to hoard everything for themselves, permanently. And just get told to piss off immediately after.\n\n\nLet's face it: most business owners have been bragging about the idea of \"finally getting rid of those stinky poors thanks to AI\" for the entire time, without ever caring about what will be of those who won't be able to find a place in a society where the 99% is no longer needed. Of course people are angry and scared at this. \n\n\nThe chances in such scenario of being treated the same way homeless people are commonly treated today, but on a mass scale, are still too high.\n\n\nLet me put it personally: After 10 years of factory job I despised (including months of deep depression and even considering \"very stupid ideas\"), I got into a job a genuinely love and look forward to. It pays _less,_ but I'd even do it for free if it wasn't that I need to pay the bills. Soon after, genAI came out and I saw legions of people chanting about such job rendered obsolete, celebrating the idea its workers losing their livelihood and forced to go elsewhere.\nIf what they say becomes true, back into the factory I go. Back into being depressed. Back into using machines that will cost you a limb the instant you put your guard down.\n\n\nIf AI was to make work not mandatory, I'd just do the job I like for fun. Most people would be fine with that. But as it is right now, it's all just going back into menial factory jobs AI isn't prospected to automate any time soon, with currently exposed tech. It's a straight downgrade from my point of view.",

          "text": "When I try to think about what will happen when AI eventually renders workers redundant I like to look at oil producing countries. In most of these countries the people in power, either by holding a high position in the government or literally being the head of a militia, basically don't need citizens.   \n  \nOil fields can be maintained by a relatively small group of people and can produce a lot of wealth. Enough that those in power don't need to provide rights or opportunities to the civilian population. The value produced by the oilfields is so much higher than anything citizens could produce that if they were incorporated into the economy they'd become a net drag on the whole system.\n\nThe only reasons most oil producing countries care for their civilian populations is:  \nA: They have strong institutions prior to getting access to oil. Think Norway.  \nB. They have the foresight to plan their economy for when after the oil runs out. Think the UAE  \nC: They fear what will happen when the civilian population becomes hostile to the government.\n\nWith AI, the value it produces won't run out like oil. If anything the gap between the value civilians can generate vs AI will just become larger. This negates option B. Additionally, AI will eventually be able to run fully automated militaries so the threat of civilians or even a military coup gets reduced significantly as direct power gets concentrated into the hands of the few, which negates option C.\n\nConsequently, the only way we as civilians can make sure our countries don't dispose of us is by making long lasting institutional changes now while we still have power. If we don't, eventually the amount of money we produce by taxes will be dwarfed by the tax produced by AI and AI companies and we'll just have to hope that either the military or our current institutions (e.g. the constitution) still protects us.\n\nThis is all probably sounding quite messy, my thoughts are still not made up on this. But I'm not convinced UBI will save us. If a country needs to pay to keep it's civilians placid surely the countries which successfully get rid of their civilians will have an advantage because they aren't spending resources supporting a giant unproductive group of people.   \n  \nIf civilians can't offer net-value to a country, why would they ever be supported?",
