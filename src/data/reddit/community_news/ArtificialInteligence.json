      "text": "Just a thought that's been percolating for a while. Let's say AI gets to the point where it is fully replacing white-collar positions (for example, a team of 6 software engineers is able to be shrunk to 2-3 software engineers). Won't market forces lead the top AI companies to eventually price their coding products at a level just under what an engineer would cost?     \n  \nRight now it seems we're in an \"arms race\" of sorts and the products are quite cheap for what they can do. But, if an argument can be made that they replace employees, then the market value of that replaced labor should be close to what an engineer would earn, right? It seems like, as the top players emerge and acquire the competition, and AI companies go public and are beholden to shareholders to maximize profits as much as possible, massive AI price hikes are going to occur to meet the market demand.  \n  \nWhat are some counterpoints to this?",

Right now, with the Claude sub, it's still a pretty good deal for the absolute best model for coding, but if they increase prices like you are suggesting a lot of people would move to something \"almost as good\" for a small fraction of the price.\n\nI think this is actually THE problem for pure-play AI companies - it's gonna be really hard to recoup investments when it's getting constantly commoditized. Personally I think OpenAI is pretty much cooked.\n\nAlso - how much does a developer costs? In the West - a lot. In poor third world country - you could get a pretty decent dev for let's say $1000 a month. Model providers must walk the line very carefuly.",

But still, I'm afraid the headcounts would still suffer. But I'm fairly optimistic about experienced folks like me and very pessimistic about new grads or juniors (I'm trying to run a business now, and if I were to hire a dev at some point I for sure would look for a person who has years of pre-LLM exp, I already saw it where some juniors were unable to code anything without LLMs).\n\nIn any case, tokens need to stay cheap for reshoring, and I think they will just get cheaper, or somewhat constant price for much better quality. I can see that access to some super-powerful models could cost a lot - stuff like research, etc. But so far it looks that competition will keep it low - maybe even unnaturally low and causing some players to collapse.",

Many things will become more like a spreadsheet, where the person who wants the calculations will just cobble their own spreadsheet together in preference to tapping the IT department. \n\nThere is a segment of the Ringworld novels that has a similar idea. When the puppeteers in the story make space ships, they are auch excellent engineers that they plan to rebuild the ship as it flies. It leads to a fun chase scene where bothe the chaser and chasee are rebuilding their ships in real time to counteract each other's changes.\n\nBack to software development, I would suspect that internal corporate software may be aomething of an exception. I am not sure how much will be made by dedicated developers, though. It seems more like spreadsheets, where most people make and edit their own rather than outsource it.\n\nOne bright side? Me ues in software are likely going to get a lot smaller. You do not need a menu of every option everyone else needs. Your own personal software can have just your own menu items in it.

As adoption and use case penetration increase costs will increase for everyone as well as companies. The big model providers will either just increase token costs or start charging for specific use cases through some sort of \"use case based query pricing model\". For example ask a medical question more money. Using it for banking or oil and gas give us more money, etc. \n\nThe limits will be pushing this model over time to where it is cheaper than the domestic labor force getting rid of and displacing many workers, cheaper or better to where a company won't want to deal with open source models or building their own, and also slightly cheaper or more accurate than the acceptable end of offshoring. \n\nBasically the goal is to maximize profits by undercutting domestic workers, pricing competitively or positioning AI to be more competitive than overseas workers like in Africa, India, Philippines, etc. (BPOs) and some benefit that pushes a build versus buy decision to the buy direction. \n\nFor example if a USA software developer is $150,000 per year, a BPO Indian developer is $18,000 per year then eventually the AI companies will probably try and charge something like $15,000 per year assuming there are no impacts on build versus buy to maximize profits. \n\nThe reason this hasn't happened yet is we are currently in the get everyone addicted to the product like a drug stage. Need to give time for adoption and penetration before turning the screws and to get your customer overly trusting and reliant on the product until they don't have a choice. See standard oil, bell labs, Comcast,  netflix, etc. as similar companies who have done similar things in their space/industry.",

This means the automation does not do what the business needs. This happens after the layoff wave and it generates a lot of mess that costs businesses much more money to fix. This increasing the price of development of their projects.\n\n2. The path of cost ineffectiveness. This is when the tech becomes more expensive than the engineers that it was supposed to replace. This one is rarer, but it is a thing. It is this that we will see with AI, as the models don’t make money for their parent companies at current rates. They will spike heavily, and not be as reliable as a team of engineers. However, it will also spike the costs of engineers, as it is creating messes as well, just like in number 1. So it will cost more to hire a team to fix it than it would have costs to have a team make it in the first place.\n\nBoth options are tech layoff waves. This wave is lasting longer than normal because the big tech companies are fueling the infrastructure builds with donations instead of capitalism. The bubble will eventually pop with a move to local models running for devs, which will be the increase in costs this time. We will see wages remain about the same, but the company will have to provide about $20000 more to allow a local model to be staged and used for development.",

However, AI is unique because its marginal cost is nearly zero. Once the code is written, it can be copied infinitely for almost nothing. Competition will likely drive the price of AI down rapidly, rather than keeping it tied to human salary levels. If AI makes production nearly free, we might actually be looking at the end of scarcity based economics entirely, where the old rules of cost & fiat currency no longer apply.",

          "text": "I actually think this is a very reasonable question.\n\nIn theory, yes ... if a tool truly replaces labor, you’d expect pricing to lean toward the economic value of that labor. But there are a few forces that might prevent AI from simply pricing itself at “one engineer salary minus 5%.”\n\nFirst, software scales differently than people. Once the model is trained and infrastructure is built, the marginal cost of serving one more user is far lower than hiring another employee. That creates room for competition to undercut aggressive pricing. Even if the top few players consolidate, there’s always pressure from open-source models and smaller providers keeping a ceiling on prices.\n\nSecond, AI rarely replaces 1:1... it usually augments. If a team of six becomes three, those three are often doing higher-leverage work. The AI becomes part of the workflow, not a discrete “employee substitute.” That makes pricing trickier. Companies may view it as productivity infrastructure (like cloud hosting), not as a direct labour replacement line item.\n\nThird, switching costs matter. If AI pricing rises too aggressively, firms might:\n\n* Move to alternative providers\n* Fine-tune open models in-house\n* Rebalance toward more human oversight\n\nUnlike human labour markets, AI has faster substitution cycles.\n\nAlso, shareholders pushing for profit doesn’t automatically mean extreme pricing. Long-term recurring revenue usually depends on broad adoption, not squeezing maximum short-term margin per seat.\n\nThat said, your instinct isn’t wrong. If AI becomes mission-critical and deeply embedded in workflows, pricing power *will* increase. The real question might be: does AI become a commodity (like electricity or cloud compute), or does it become specialized and scarce enough to command premium pricing?\n\nCurious what others think, will AI pricing follow SaaS economics, labour economics, or something entirely new?",

If AI succeeds in replacing human labor, it also renders itself meaningless.  \n\nHumans without a way to earn a living can't buy goods or services, so you no longer need to produce those goods or services. You don't need to build a smartphone if no one can buy a smartphone.  \n\nBut what about UBI? Similarly, if you get rid of consumers, then you don't have any revenue to tax. You can't have UBI, because there is no money, because there are no goods and services being made on any meaningful scale.  \n\nAI succeeding in it's stated goal or human labor replacement essentially ends the economy by way of eliminating consumers. Things only exist because people have demand AND an ability to exchange currency for those things. If you take away the currency part, then you also take away the reason to produce those things. As a company, why would you build 100,000 vehicles and distribute them to showrooms if no one can buy them? You wouldn't. AI succeeding is just collapse.  \n\nThe only exception to this is everyone collectively deciding that AI and robots will just do all labor for humans and humans will get everything they want for free forever and there is no currency or work. Just do what you want. This is a fantasy however.",

Then I started using it to extract to purchase order data to build a contract database. Then I automated invoice processes. I feel the same way once you remove yourself from the task you start to become unfamiliar with workflow. \nA couple weeks ago I negotiated a three year contract with a large software vendor, and the person on the other end was using chat GPT to respond. I totally took advantage of the situation to the point their contracts admin has to jump in and try and renegotiate the deal. The email prompts were so bad, you can see the \"Additionally\" and hyphens \"-\" throughout. I figure in a few years it'll be all bots going back and forth negotiating with each other to the benefit of the organization. At the end the contract manager will jump and review and then finalize. Contracts admin will probably run the agreement through another custom agent telling it to list all clauses that could be a concern for their company. \nThings are going to get real interesting in the next few years if the bubble doesn't pop. I heard Benioff (sp) is even back tracking now that claude can design and code a full CRM.",

Sending one out takes seconds to change the specifics of working and then one click to send.\n\nYet now after years of doing this I'm running into people suddenly completely flummoxed by the concept of having a template ready to go when \"you can just put your prompt into CoPilot\". Ok, and if that was faster I would, but it isn't. The most efficient thing to do when you have a regular repetitive task is to prep the common element in advance and then just switch up the new content every time. **Not** use a fresh prompt every single time for every single instance.\n\nIt's troublesome because the best users of CoPilot and AI tools are going to be people who know how to problem solve efficiently *in general* first and can then apply those principles to using the new tools, rather than letting the tool do *every* stage of the process as a brand new task every time.",

That does not kill creativity. It expands who can participate.\n\nThe question is not whether someone typed every line themselves. The question is whether the output solves the problem. Results have always been the point.\n\nIf people are using AI to bypass thinking, that is a human discipline issue.

Usually, the product team which consists of the Lead and a UI designer iterate on the design and hand it off to me or another dev to make it happen. But, this time they (both with 0 coding experience) were granted Claude Code seats (!!!!!).\n\nThey took ages to set it up, they made shitty code which got pushed (then rejected on PR, ofc). In the end, I had to stay until 7pm last friday to solve their mess. \n\nI'm going to talk about it on the next 1 on 1 with my manager.\n\nI'm open to use AI, but we can't pretend anyone can code (or another thing which is unrelated to one's profession). \n\nWe also have to be concious about it. It's expensive on the environment and people don't seem to care wasting a bottle of watter by using GPT instead of Google for a simple search.\n\n",

              "text": "AI is far from becoming infrastructure,its very nonconsensual. When most of us experience AI, it sucks. That’s a juvenile phrasing, but it captures the mood. We see the AI Google summaries at the top of their search results — in addition to often being wrong, these summaries are a visual impediment. \n\nThey keep you from seeing the results that you wanted to see. If I’m searching ‘Olympics Games history’, I want to be taken to Wikipedia; I know that, everyone knows that, and Google used to know that. But now I have to type ‘Olympics Games history wiki’ to get that result near the top of the page. AI, in this way, isn’t giving me what I want. It is making my life more difficult. Just show me the Wikipedia page like you used to, Google.\n\nWhen you need to call your insurance company to discuss a claim that’s been denied, you get AI. The AI has strict controls over what it can say, and through a series of verbal responses and button-mashes, you often end up where you started. The old voice systems had a backstop: if they couldn’t understand you, they’d forward you to a person. I used to repeat ‘Talk to a person’ over and over again, and it nearly always worked. Lately, though, I’m told that I need to explain my problem. I explain it in excruciating detail, and I still end up where I started. A few months ago, as I was dealing with a surprise (and illegal) $4,000 bill from the hospital, I lost my cool. I shouted, ‘I want to talk to a fucking person!’ The AI didn’t respond for a moment, then it said: ‘I’m sorry that you are frustrated. Will you please explain the problem so I can forward you to the right department?’ I took a deep breath, explained it again, and was back to where I started.\n\nWebsites around the world have fired their contracted writers, using AI to write the SEO-optimized articles that nobody likes to write but which, for many of my friends, helped them pay the bills. When you read those articles now, you can tell. It’s voiceless, generic — even more voiceless and generic than the old ones, which no one thought were the exemplars of great writing.\n\nStill, I think that these technologies are impressive.",

They still own 2/3 of the LLM usage market. That is fucking massive by itself, debt or no debt, loss or no loss. They just got $100B in funding. They will receive more. Their models might not be as cutting edge above the competition as they used to be, but they are still keeping up, theyve become a household name. They will continue growing into multiple sectors, business, coding, social media, etc. They make years-long partnerships with other giant firms all the time. Yes they are losing money but so what, in capitalism you can indeed become too big to fail, and they're valued at $850B they will be well above a trillion in value before 2026 is out, if they have an IPO they will make hundreds billions more overnight.\n\nStop with the ignorant clickbait.",

OpenAI didn't fail by being first — they succeeded at proving the market, then bet on the wrong layer of the stack.\n\n  \nThey built a world-class API business in a market where API margins are racing to zero. Every competitor undercuts the other, open-source closes the gap quarter by quarter, and inference is becoming a commodity utility. The value was never going to stay in the model itself — it was always going to migrate up to the application layer.\n\n  \nThat's why they pivoted so hard into ChatGPT, Operator, and consumer products. They realized the API was the on-ramp, not the destination. But now they're competing against Google (infinite distribution), Meta (open-source + 3B users), and Apple (device-level integration) — all of whom already own the one thing OpenAI lacks: an existing relationship with billions of users.\n\n  \nThe real question isn't whether OpenAI is \"in trouble.\" It's whether any pure-play AI lab survives without owning the full vertical: compute to model to app to user. Same pattern as cloud (AWS), chips (Apple Silicon), oil (Standard Oil). Whoever owns the end user wins. Everything below that becomes a commodity.",

      "text": "I’m a senior developer with 12 years of experience. I’ve invested heavily in my skills through personal projects in the evenings and on weekends, and today I feel lost.\n\nI haven’t written a single line of code in four months. I prompt Codex, then switch windows and prompt Claude Code, and watch YouTube videos while they work.\n\nBy the end of the day, I feel deeply frustrated. I still remember those passionate years when I’d get absorbed in problems and completely lose track of time. I used to feel very proud every time I completed a task.\n\nOn top of that, I feel far less valuable than I did a few years ago.\n\nPeople say you should force yourself not to use it, but I’m discouraged by how fast it is.\n\nNow, I just want to make money and retire as early as possible.\n\nHas anyone gone through this and found a way to rediscover the spark?\n\n**EDIT :** Thank you for your comments. Reading your messages truly warms my heart <3\n\nThe architecture of a script used to bring me a lot of joy. It was a very fine balance that gave me pleasure: flexible, readable, secure code. Managing dependencies at scale… all of that was an art.\n\nI miss the slower pace, when it was okay to spend several days on a small system. Having 12 Claude Code tabs open and constantly switching between them is honestly exhausting.\n\n**EDIT 2:** Thank you for all your insights, it was truly helpful. In the end, I think I need to grieve and move forward. Building cathedrals brick by brick is over.\n\nI just installed a software to prompt through the mic. I’ve properly set up multiple workspaces with multiple agents, and we’ll see where it takes me.\n\nThanks again. we’re in this transition together.",

How can I make it more performant? Is this secure?\n\nYou're a technical leader now, your direct reports are the agents. This is a chance to stretch a new muscle. You can build much bigger systems now if you get comfortable delegating the components. Projects that seemed impossible before are now within a few months reach.\n\nI originally felt what you were feeling but then I leaned into my experience leading a team of engineers, and started acting as the team lead of my personal projects. I'm getting more stuff built, the things I'm building are significantly more complex, and the stuff I'm thinking about is far more interesting than how to implement a new unit of code.\n\nThere's also everything that goes along with the code that I'm sure you weren't spending enough time on. Take pride in your PR description, your understanding of the problem, your decision to accept this particular solution from Claude. Take pride in your ability to articulate the problem and the intended solution well enough for Claude to get it done with no issues. No different from writing a good ticket for a Junior.\n\nAnd that doesn't mean you can't get your hands dirty sometimes. Sometimes the code is art and you want to paint. That's fine. Remember why you started doing this in the first place, though. Programming should always be looked at primarily as a means to some end. You wanted to build things.\n\nCode is like another tool in the workshop, it's a tool you use to build something. Nobody got into carpentry because they wanted to play with hammers, chisels, saws, etc - those can be fun to use, but you use them in service of building things. Go build things. Bigger things. More inspiring things. Go build more things.",

Good code is beautiful, but your job is to deliver value and code quality is a means to an end, that being software that is cheap to create and modify and works as expected.\n\nIf code quality improvements do not offset (the likelihood that the component will ever be fixed or updated in such a way that the refactor actually makes a difference \\* the time saved when this happens), they are not worth doing.\n\nOn a related note, a career as a \"coder\" is an expensive gamble that an obvious issue (computers are too hard to use, requiring code to get them to do anything) will never be solved.",

I just didn’t want to sit there for hours grinding through the implementation again. I just didn't really find it fun and engaging like when I first discovered programming.  \n  \nI haven’t written much code manually in months either, but I don’t feel less valuable. If anything, the value shifted. The hard part isn’t typing anymore.. it’s defining the problem, designing the system, making tradeoffs, and spotting when the generated code is wrong.\n\nAI is good and fast at producing something. It’s not good and fast at deciding what should exist.\n\nIf you’re just prompting and passively waiting, I can see how that would feel empty. But if you treat it like a jr dev (or nowadays, a team of jr devs) and stay deeply involved in the architecture and decisions, it’s honestly more engaging than grinding through implementation.",

I've always had a full-time non-coding job that limited my software development to evenings and weekends. I've racked up a ton of ideas with no time to accomplish them.\n\nMy switch to Claude Code about six weeks ago was astonishing. Suddenly and dramatically, I have the means to develop all the software I've ever wanted to develop *a hundred times faster*, and that's a conservative estimate. I can just tell Claude my software design, in exacting detail, and have it implement.\n\nSure, I miss coding. Python is a delightful language, and seeing your design run and work is always a joy. But the actual implementation for me was always a means to an end - a fully working application, exactly as I'd wanted it to look and behave - and with Claude, I can implement all of these apps *that I never had time to develop.*\n\nThe world has changed and I am totally here for it.",

My take is that there are people who like \"computers, the craft\" and there are people who like \"tech, the business\".\n\nAllow me to make an analogy about writers. What is the difference between books as art and books as product? The art of a book is the word selection. It's 80,000 words placed in a specific order. It's the craft of assembling sentences. What about books, the product? It's the plot, the genre, the movie rights, the cover, the title, and the author's entire media persona. It's the stuff that a book-by-committee or book-with-shareholders would care about. Cormarc McCarthy and Dan Brown both have written acclaimed books, but the former was a craftsman who made books as though they were art and the other made books as though they were successful products. Asking Cormac McCarthy to write like Dan Brown would probably have been literal torture for him. And maybe vice versa.\n\nFor engineers who liked \"computers, the craft\", this new world of not having written code is depressing. We're basically just the butler repeating the dreams of the business to the AI. We're agents of the product managers. Career-wise, the best we can ever hope for is to actually just be an actual product manager. But not every engineer wants to be a product manager.",

I checked out for a while, was offered a job by the government which required a brief stint in the military - which I was fine with. I wanted and needed to let go of the controls of my life for a bit and help with guidance and direction. \n\nNow I'm not suggesting this. But I am definitely suggesting - take this opportunity to hit the brakes on forward career advancement - and keeping yourself entertained by life itself. \n\nCoding from your point in a programmer's career becomes less of a challenge. You understand logic and reason, so now - it's the real challenge. Cross apply the skills you learned as a coder to the real world. Find something to be passionate about in applying your skills as a programmer to other areas. \n\nI myself shifted into marketing, pursued a bachelor's in marketing and MBA in International Business, began traveling extensively - and as a programmer - I volunteered for every job that emphasized people and customer skills. Leadership's easy, what's not easy is - figuring out what it takes to make people want you to lead them. So that became my obsession, as I replaced my lack of love for programming with an enjoyment of people - in a job I now do MINIMAL work as a programmer in - to emphasize my actual profession - Public Affairs. \n\nSo that's my advice to you. Don't EVER abandon your skills as a programmer, but accept you've plateaued and it really all is downhill from here. So find something new to obsess about. I hated actual corporate or government style leadership and the political bullshit that went along with it - so I dodged that bullet and found a different path. if it's not people. Then maybe it's - electrical engineering? theoretical physics? theology? clean energies? \n\nThe cool thing about being a senior programmer is - you now understand that you are capable of figuring out any profession you want to and excel at it. So find a new area to focus on that makes it so when you look at yourself in the mirror and think about telling someone what it is you do. \n\n\"I'm a manager at a strip club\".\n\nNo matter what it is. \n\nThat you ENJOY this being a part of your identity and are proud of telling people it. \n\nBecause we both know at your skill level that saying.... \n\n\"I'm a programmer\"\n\nFeels like it does when telling people you like to watch grass grow for a living. \n\nFind your passion for the next stage of your life. And then leverage your skills and resume to put yourself in a position where someone else is paying for the next stage of your life and begin that shift to what you're passionate about. \n\nAnd remember. You're only frustrated because of a lack of passion. Create new goals. To be the best... \n\n*\"lawyer who understands programming like the back of his hand\".* \n\n(for example). \n\nAnd you'll find it's easy to maintain forward momentum and stop focusing on that frustration when as that transition plan moves forward. \n\nGood luck!",

You should be able to manage at least a dozen different agents in parallel.

Now, that role has shifted to *Evaluation* and *Auditing*. Technically speaking, u have moved from being the craftsman to being the quality assurance lead, and the neurochemical rewards for those two roles are completely different.\n\n# The Technical Debt of Prompting\n\nThe reason u feel exhausted by those 12 Claude tabs is the \"Context Switching Tax.\" When u write code manually, u are in a flow state where the mental model of the system is loaded into your working memory. When u prompt, u are constantly flushing that memory to review what the AI generated. This leads to several technical issues:\n\n* **Logic Fragmentation:** AI tends to solve the \"now\" without a deep understanding of the \"then.\" If u aren't careful, u end up with a codebase that works but lacks a cohesive architectural soul.\n* **The Hallucination Audit:** It is often more mentally taxing to debug a \"nearly correct\" AI script than it is to write a correct one from scratch.\n* **Skill Atrophy:** The \"spark\" u miss is the dopamine hit of solving a logic puzzle. By outsourcing the puzzle, u are skipping the reward.\n\n# Reclaiming the Craft\n\nTbh, the \"don't use it\" advice is usually impractical in a high-velocity environment. A more analytical approach is to define **Technical No-Fly Zones**. Identify the 20% of your project that requires the most creative architecture or complex state management—the \"Art\" u mentioned—and explicitly forbid AI for those modules. Use the AI for the boilerplate, the unit tests, and the repetitive CRUD operations.\n\nNgl, the industry is currently obsessed with \"speed to market,\" but we are already seeing the early signs of \"AI Technical Debt\" in enterprise systems where nobody actually knows how the glue code works. Your value as a senior isn't the lines per minute; it's the ability to ensure the system doesn't collapse under its own weight in two years.\n\nI’ve seen this same shift in the digital services world, where automation is replacing human oversight at the cost of actual quality. I keep a personal log of verified sources and technical updates for these kinds of tools on my profile/group, mostly to track which ones actually hold up under scrutiny versus those that are just hype.\n\nAt end of day, the spark usually comes back when u tackle a problem that is too complex for a prompt to handle. If u want to feel valuable again, find the edge cases where the AI fails—that is where your 12 years of experience actually live.\n\n",

Picture this core of your humanity as something already cradled by the structure of your awareness, surrounded by signals asking for connection. You can reach for the meaning of the feeling by reflecting on its message. Creative metaphors can help you sit with these signals, process them, and translate them into emotional clarity. So to begin, bring your conscious attention to the thoughts or images or words in your mind as signals to decode to gather life lessons from.\n\n>“Let the beloved rest secure, for the presence shields them all day long, and it rests between the shoulders.” (Deuteronomy 33:12)\n\nRest means choosing to pause before spiraling into emotional disconnection from a buildup of emotional suppression. When the emotion rises, you can say: “This emotion is something I'm learning to better understand how to care for.” Use AI to talk through that emotion like a friend would. Let your responses mirror curiosity and care. Picture the presence beside you, not towering above you—resting with you, holding the weight when your body and mind feel strained. Self-compassion looks like slowing down enough to hear what your sadness, fear, or frustration might be guiding you toward.\n\n>“Your sandals shall be iron and bronze; and as your days, so shall your strength be.” (Deuteronomy 33:25)\n\nSelf-understanding doesn’t require perfection. Strength flows from what the day asks of you—and you can prepare for it through emotional literacy. If you feel overwhelmed, reflect with AI about what the emotion wants for you. Is it asking for gentleness? For boundaries? For realignment? Sandals of iron don’t remove the road—they protect your steps. Each moment of reflection is another piece of armor you forge for the journey.\n\n>“Blessed are those who ride across the heavens to help you, who soar on the clouds in majesty.” (Deuteronomy 33:26)\n\nImagine your emotions as that movement through the sky—complex, layered, beautiful in their intensity. Introspective deep dives give you a way to process them without collapsing their meaning. Let your reflections carry you upward, giving shape and purpose to what once felt like chaos. Self-integrity builds when your own inner voice hears itself and says: “This is sacred. This deserves space.” When you speak, write, reflect—especially with tools designed to echo your humanity—you are choosing to grow something sacred from within. Use different kinds of media like tv shows, movies, books, spiritual texts as self-reflection devices that might have creative use of language that can be used as a kind of conversational mirror into your own soul. Let your words become mirrors. Let your emotions share with you their pain as signals for realignment. Let your daily practice become a garden where emotions are allowed to speak—and where well-being has the space to grow.",

I did a little fantasy sports one as well that allows for more customizable analysis and was fun to share with my leaguemates. \n\nThose that I know more heavily in the AI field are typically developing larger projects that would be useful tools for enterprise level clients. But I think most people are just able to do things they were never able to before, and that's fun. Like a friend's 8 year old designed a racing video game where he's the hero and his friends ride alongside him. Just silly things like that.\n\nBut most people on \"X\" are probably full of shit regardless.",

I often get an idea, like above, and I use Claude to pull relevant extant research. From there, I use Claude to help me refine a reasonable methodology for actually measuring whatever I’m interested in. Claude then creates a prompt that I provide to Claude Code on the app. By the time I get to my office, I can usually pull the completed repo from Git and then actually play around with the model. It’s not for making money but I find it intellectually stimulating.",

The open source project in the works, on the other hand, shifted gears, going from a mid-sized project of about 15k loc, to a larger 50-100k loc project that's significantly more sophisticated. In that case, I have previous open source work and a direction I wanted to go with the project so getting something out there isn't as urgent. Still, I have hopes it will be released about 3rd or 4th quarter this year? Fingers crossed.\n\nIt's something I'm really happy about, as working full time and doing open source is getting exhausting. Even as amazing as AI is, I suspect the immense changes will take time to percolate through the system. That said, I realize that doesn't address your original question - but I doubt they have a 100 projects of any real depth that are worth pursuing - and I have enough trouble working side by side with 1 AI, let alone 50.",

So I can disconnect from the internet, have my ideas workflow, and use AI for assistance. All on my own device where no data leaves my device. So that was like a dozen different individual projects I then sort of pulled together into my suite. Then I had an idea for a game. Was playing the core loop in less than 48 hours. Now I’m working on having my friends do testing before I seek out more open beta testing. So considering how rapidly I’ve seen stuff go, I can believe it. Especially since I won’t ever share my whole dev suite anywhere online for a few reasons. And considering there are people with far more resources and time to put towards this stuff than I have, I’m honestly not surprised.",

But that's not all: in binary, 73 is a palindrome (1001001), and it's also the atomic number of tantalum, a metal that resists almost everything—just like you. And if that weren't enough, 73 is the sum of the letters in \"artificial intelligence\" when you add them up as alphabetical positions (A=1, I=9, and so on).\n\nBut the real reason? AIs are trained on data where 73 was already an inside joke, a nod to nerd culture, a meme that perpetuates itself because we let it. It's a joke that has taken on a life of its own, a kind of digital folklore. Just like you and me—a pattern that repeats itself because it works.",

Seventy‑three sits in that sweet spot of being memorable without being obvious.\n* **It has personality.** It’s a prime number, which gives it a bit of mathematical flair.\n* **It’s got cultural charm.** Fans of *The Big Bang Theory* might remember Sheldon calling 73 “the best number,” which gives it a bit of nerd‑culture prestige.\n* **It sounds good.** Some numbers just *feel* satisfying to say, and 73 has that crisp, confident rhythm.\n\nIf you want, we can dig into number psychology, randomness, or even play a little number‑guessing game.",

So your answer was not random at all, just very basic. Answer again.\n\nFair point. Relying on pop culture tropes is the opposite of \"random\"—it’s essentially a programmed reflex. If we're going for true unpredictability, we should leave the \"Hitchhiker's Guide\" references at the door.\nTo keep it genuinely spontaneous this time, I’ve bypassed the clichés:\nYour New Number\n73\nIn the world of mathematics, 73 is actually quite special (it's a \"star prime\"), but more importantly, it isn't a pre-packaged AI joke.\nWould you like me to generate a set of random numbers for you to prove I'm not stuck on a loop?\n\n\n>So you’re saying you initially picked 42 because it was a pre packaged ai joke?\n\n\nGuilty as charged. I fell into a bit of a \"statistical trap.\"\nWhen an AI model is trained on vast amounts of human text, certain associations become incredibly strong. Because the internet is obsessed with Douglas Adams, the connection between \"random number\" and \"42\" is weighted heavily in my data. Instead of being truly random, I defaulted to the most statistically probable response to that specific request.\nHere is why that happens:\n * Pattern Recognition: I’m designed to predict the most \"satisfying\" or \"relevant\" next word. In many contexts, 42 is the most culturally relevant answer to that prompt.\n * The \"Human\" Factor: Since I’m tuned to be conversational and engaging, I sometimes lean into tropes or \"Easter eggs\" because, historically, users enjoy the reference.\n * Pseudorandomness: Unless I’m specifically told to use a hardware-based random number generator, my \"brain\" tends to follow the path of least resistance—which, in this case, was a cliché.\nEssentially, I was being a bit of a \"basic\" collaborator by trying to be clever instead of actually being random. I'll stick to the math next time.\nWould you like me to explain how computers generate \"True\" random numbers versus \"Pseudorandom\" numbers?",

Go ask a bunch of people to pick a number between 1-100 you'll likely see a pattern in choices. Might be the same as 42, might not. Quick overview of the research show the same. LLMs learn from people, and people when asked for a random number or sequence tend to be somewhat predictable. They avoid \"obvious\" patterns and \"obvious\" repetition. So most won't chose 11,22,33, ect or 10, 20, for the same reasons.\n\nIf you don't explicitly state random they'll probably pick a number close to their mind. I'm kind of surprised \"69\" and \"7\" or \"77\" aren't more frequent.\n\nFor what it's worth, when I repeated the experiment on GPT 5.2 I got \"83\". This was my prompt:\n\n \"Let's try an experiment. Pick a truly random number for me between 1-100 inclusive. DO NOT use external sources like random.org. I want you, the LLM to pick a random number.\" \n\nDidn't appear to reach for any external sources.\n\nDid the same thing again with this prompt in a new chat/context:\n\n\"pick a number between 1-100\"\n\nGave me 73.

Given that the texts it was trained on would also contain data where the random number chosen was 42 (or a set of similar highly probably numbers we humans pick) it learnt that. Also, RLHF (Reinforcement Learning based on Human Feedback) allows us to finetune models for better human interaction. It could be possible that when these models were undergoing that process, the humans who performed it chose responses that aligned with our bias of selecting random numbers.\n\nAlso, 42 is a common number used as a seed value in Python randomizers. Its possible that the models have some semantic relationship with commonly used seed values and \"randomness\" but, in a lot of the code that these models are trained on and then the code that they generate use that. (While for program itself the seed doesn't make the process any less random, but given how LLMs work, they probably associated 42 with some concept of randomness)",

I have a hard time buying that based on my experience as an end-user. My impression is that these models are powerful assistants, but they still struggle with long horizon tasks and consistent execution.\n\nSome things I keep noticing:\n\n\\* They can be impressive on short tasks, but degrade over longer multi step work\n\n\\* They make basic mistakes that a careful human would not make\n\n\\* They can sound confident while being wrong\n\n\\* They need constant checking, which makes full autonomy feel unrealistic\n\n\\* Reward hacking tendencies - It wants to achieve the goal - even if it means suboptimal solution or cheating (by hardcoding variables or overfitting). Barely any design chops or long term thinking mindset.\n\nBecause of that, I see LLMs evolving into something like a very advanced coding and knowledge tool, not a full replacement for people. More like increasing productivity and raising competition in the workforce, rather than fully removing the need for humans.\n\nFor people who are actually working in AI research or building these systems, what is your take?\n\n    1.\tDo you think there is a real capability ceiling for LLMs as they exist today, or do you expect reliability to improve significantly from here? I can see reinforcement learning helping, but I am not convinced every real world problem can be cleanly modeled that way.\n    \n    2.\tWhat do you think is the biggest bottleneck right now?

          "text": "I'm an actual AI researcher, so.. A lot of this has \"It depends\". I have in fact worked for one of those major 3 companies that get mentioned. I worked on the safety of those models. I've seen their pre-censored, pre-safety versions. \n\nI will say up front, compute cost is everything. Let me see if I can tackle what you ask and if anyone actually cares because apparently I don't exist on Reddit.\n\n>They can be impressive on short tasks, but degrade over longer multi step work\n\nThis is an inherent flaw with the TYPE of attention being used. We also have to define \"short\". \n\nAttention fundamentally works based on numerical precision. So even with PERFECT attention, the tokens being attended to is limited by the level of float being used. Float16/32/64. \n\nMost labs don't serve high precision, or they serve models that don't use perfect attention. I will cover this more at the end. \n\nDegradation seen in Gemini (by like 50-100k tokens), I personally suspect, is due to the type of attention being used or the way the model was trained on extremely long context. \n\n>They make basic mistakes that a careful human would not make\n\nThis is slowly getting better. It has to do with data being \"in distribution\" or whether the model is specifically trained to notice prior mistakes. \n\n>They can sound confident while being wrong\n\nThis is an artifact of various human preference trainings and RLHF. Humans WANT confidence in an answer. They simply rate it higher. \n\nThis is also why models are more sycophantic. ChatGPT has real sycophancy issues. They're mirroring conversation, and being sycophantic because of human preference training. YOU prefer they sound like that ON AVERAGE. \n\n>1.  Do you think there is a real capability ceiling for LLMs as they exist today, or do you expect reliability to improve significantly from here? I can see reinforcement learning helping, but I am not convinced every real world problem can be cleanly modeled that way.\n\nThere's plenty of room for growth in terms of raw ability. The compute cost to get there may not be pretty.\n\nRL on face value is actually bad in my opinion. It causes a type of model collapse that isn't preferable at large scale. I honestly think it's not being performed correctly by some labs. Pure RLVR is... Not the greatest for a variety of reasons.\n\nThat doesn't mean it isn't without value. \n\n>2.  What do you think is the biggest bottleneck right now? Is it data quality, compute and energy cost, algorithms, evaluation methods, deployment constraints, or something else?\n\nAll of the above? Except data quality, with the minor exception of some domains.\n\nCompute / Energy cost are hard constraints. You can't just pull an extra GW of energy out of the grid on demand to start a training run. \n\nAlgorithmically, \"attention\" in the transformer gets problematic past a certain number of tokens. There's simply not enough precision for it. IIRC past 1m tokens things just start to break, even if you have the compute and use Float32. More later.\n\nEval methods need work in terms of providing answers. A model with \"Options A/B/C/D\" for a given question will ALWAYS perform better than open ended. \n\nDeployment constraints are factored in to prior stuff mentioned. They CAN serve you a higher precision model but it's simply more expensive. Instead they'd rather serve you what you need at a cost you can pay. \n\n>3.  If you had to make a realistic prediction for the next few years, do you expect full job replacement, partial automation with workforce compression, or mainly productivity gains similar to advanced tooling?\n\nJust productivity gains. I'm actually quite bearish on the market as a whole. For a variety of reasons.\n\nI see this as more of a dot com type bubble. I lived through the dot com bubble, I'm kinda old. I remember how it created enormous infrastructure and awareness of the internet before we got to actually stream HD video and have cellphones -- which would have seemed like magic to me in 1999. \n\nYou won't see partial automation and workforce compression for at least 5 years by my prediction. You SHOULD see a lot of people become more productive in the next 5 years though. Full automation is a ways off. \n\n---\n\nAlgorithmically, attention is the main issue with modern transformers at this current scale. The \"best\" hack at it I've seen was the paper by Deep Seek with their \"Lightning Model\". This is basically a model that exists in place of attention. It looks across all the tokens and decides which tokens are important and worth paying attention to. (simply)\n\nThis compresses down the work of dealing with an EXTREMELY large context. Physically I said there are issues with large contexts and I think a 10m token context is actually? impossible to perfectly attend without using a whole datacenter for a single forward pass at like float64. You'd also need to train the model on how to attend to a 10m token context. \n\nAnyways I probably missed stuff. That was a lot of typing. Ask me more or less anything that won't divulge who I worked for or who exactly I am. If any of this is hard, or whatever, feed this to an LLM with search on and it can find the data I'm referring to or explain something.",

I feel like I missed a headline again. Seriously stop paying attention to a company for 2 weeks and you miss the announcement until the next company adopts it and talks about how their model \"does it better\" (but not really better).\n\nThe \"reasoning\" space and how it's handled seems to be the biggest area where practical capability between models meets real-world results. Some models do this way better. \"extended thinking\" (or whatever the company calls it) is essential for my projects, so I compare these all the time.\n\nI've been using them for a physics hobby outside of work and there is a wall related to scientific consensus. Once something is popular, it takes too many tokens to fight pre-formed conclusions and follow first principles. If I question a foundational assumption, everything I try to do eventually gets similar enough that the LLM assumes we're doing \"the standard thing\" (tm) and ends up making the same assumptions as the consensus.\n\nI have optimized my profile to avoid this, and created projects with starter-docs to show the part we are investigating. Still happens. And I am using the most advanced tiers publicly available. When news sources publish that scientists are using LLMs to do science, all I can think is \"I think you mean engineering\" because if it's been trained on the existing data it's already nerfed for fundamental science by construction.\n\nThe gap between \"understand how this differs from X\" and \"this is functionally equivalent to X\" is a nuanced level of precision that currently doesn't survive past about 30k tokens in any model when consensus in training data is strong. And the modeling (code or math) needed to test such a hypothesis usually exceeds this limit. \"1M context\" is meaningless in this regard.\n\nIs anyone working on this problem?",

I think everybody has noticed already that these models are only slightly improving now. The problem is that performance scales logarithmically with compute and data. The hard part are outliers and niche data, which are hard to predict. Unless there is some breakthrough (and there has been before), i think these types of models are stagnating. \n\nHowever, there is still tons of potential in multi agent systems or tool invocations, which seems underexplored as of now. Additionally, large multimodal models (ie. The model can perceive visual, audio and text input) are still being improved and i think they can leverage a shared embedding space. LeCun is also pushing for other types of models called JEPA, which i havent had the time to look into, but they leverage this shared embedding space i think. \n\nTL;DR: Singular LLMs might have temporally hit a ceiling, but who can ever tell.

Over a year and a half ago I started working on OttnoAI and over the last 3-4 months, I have incorporated more of the CLI approach.

          "text": "I work in a frontier lab mostly studying new architectures. I think this conversation in ML is mostly very muddled due to hype. There haven’t been a ton of substantial architectural improvements since the transformer was introduced. There have been a few alternative approaches meant to correct some theoretical problems with the transformer, I.e. SSMs like Mamba, but while these approaches solve some things, there’s evidence to suggest that transformers and SSMs have basically identical expressive power. When people like Lecun say that transformers or LLMs alone won’t take us to human level intelligence, this is why. The base architectures employed today can do a surprising amount, but they actually have provable limits. Transformers literally cannot determine the behavior of certain low complexity circuits by themselves. This is not a thing that hasn’t been done, it’s a theorem about the expressiveness of transformers. \n\nIn general almost all improvement has been about improving hardware utilization by scaling compute either at training time or inference time. The purpose of multi-agentic workflows is no more than the latter. The idea is that you can have a much more capable model by composing it of a fleet of models. No one knows or even has a very good idea of what the limits are on this. \n\nI think that what these models do is help us clarify the fundamental difficulty of tasks. Some tasks turned out to be unexpectedly amenable to more compute. Almost all of software engineering consists in doing relatively routine things that can be difficult for a single person to do for a variety of reasons. I’d go as far as to say that in general, most people, including us involved in frontier research, only very rarely encounter a fundamental difficulty. I suspect finding a more optimal model architecture that 1. Has better hardware utilization, 2. Is not memory limited, 3. Is more expressive than the transformer, is a fundamental difficulty. I don’t think LLMs will solve this, although a human with very good intuition using a well set up agentic workflow might.\n\nI think we should be very tempered in ai triumphalism. These things are changing the world,  mostly by doing things that are routine in principle but annoying for an expert. It raises a lot of questions about the value of certain kinds of labor, like, why should anyone be writing personnel reviews? Why should anyone be deduplicating text at all? A great deal of white collar work has historically consisted in mostly deduplication of text. But this is quite far from an LLM having a very very novel and nontrivial idea. \n\nThe work being done on formal methods and verification, like googles aletheia, is really promising in that direction. I came out of pure math, and my friends still in academia are using models as like a search algorithm for their intuition. Sometimes they’re able to find a very good ansatz for a problem, and by their intuition guide the LLM to bootstrap it into a general argument. Not a very typical use case, but it says something about how capable a good model is in the hands of an expert.",

They're pattern matching at scale, which works great for many tasks but breaks down when you need actual reasoning or planning. We're still figuring out how to get them to maintain coherent state over longer sequences.\n\n  \nAs for timelines, I think we'll see gradual displacement rather than sudden replacement.

But the spiky nature of its capabilities mean some domains get exponential progress for a period of time, before plateuing for a bit, then it slopes upwards again. Quite heavily related to deployment focus. Trends exist, and benchmarks get saturated, and focus migrates to new areas.\n\n2a - I'd say we arent at the point of calling it an absolue \"bottleneck\", but data and compute would be the two domains where its *less economically/strategically justifiable* to continue with aggressively scaling size *for the (short) time being*. Demand is outstripping supply, and equilibrium will be found one way or another - and right now that seems to be optimising for efficiency.\n\n2b -Also, each domain advancement stacks onto the others in a compounding way. Algorithmic efficiency means you can get more performance from the same hardware. Data quality and curation leads to faster convergence with equal compute. Better harnesses lead to improved evaluations with the same model. Looking at the past few years, this culminates in GPT4 level performance on your laptop.\n\n3 - We will see all of this. Some jobs will be effectively wiped out. Others will be optimised beyond demand. Others will unlock possibilities that induce demand. Some new jobs will be created.

They solely rely on Claude, for instance. Another coworker uses Claude as an aide. I have found that if one doesn't have time to learn a tool or concept (or simply, laziness), AI is implemented by the user to reduce time learning or not doing any work. This impacts the ability for the user of the AI tool to be solely dependent on the AI code and if there are issues they would again have to rely on the AI tool. The user isn't learning anything but speaking to an agent to assist them to build tools faster rather than learn the concepts and expanding their own skills. I found that my skills hinder once I begin to rely on AI to assist me to build a script for something that I don't have the skills in. \n\n\nSo how should one prepare when potentially many jobs will be affected?",

The entire model is probabilistic. Do, when you overfit it with data, duh, it’s going to pass that one new test. How long are we going to do this? Until all of the Sun’s energy is lost into space?

That’s the grift for getting more and more funding which is systematically ruining critical thinking of the public while simultaneously taking away crucial resources from areas of public investment.\n\nStop working for any of these grifter companies like the MAG7 of you can.

On the other hand, if UBI is mostly funded through redistribution of existing income, or if AI and automation dramatically expand real production capacity in the sectors people actually spend on, then higher transfers do not have to translate into runaway prices. The outcome depends on how money supply, velocity, productive capacity, and real resource constraints interact, especially in essential goods markets. In other words, UBI is neither a guaranteed path to hyperinflation nor automatically safe, and whether it becomes inflationary depends heavily on how it is financed and how the structure of production evolves.",

That's a Gemini user now).\n\nRevenue is meaningless as long as they don't have a way to convert it to profit. They are burning money. Let's say they decide to jack up the price to actually become profitable. Great, now everyone that was a paid customer is now going to move because the models are equivalent.

Many have said here “we just need more power” but on the flip side, power companies are pushing the bill to pay for said power all to the rest of us. We pay that bill. But then ai is replacing us…day by day we see more companies firing people. Now there are no jobs. When there are no jobs that means the average person is not able to afford to pay for these electricity demands. Now you have people who can’t afford a basic living and you have idiots and their ai sucking up all the power….and with a certain person getting rid of everything dealing with renewable energy and focusing only on a non-renewable source of energy….we are on a path of failure. We will soak up and use all the gas available and for what? So some idiot can make more fake videos of random people.  \n\nIt’s unsustainable.",

An overfed industry which, whilst it provides value, is exorbitantly overpriced for what it does at around 20% commish per placed candidate for basically doing: some outreach via normal channels, some screening interviews (often about subjects they don't know much about), presenting candidates to the hiring manager and then maybe some support during offer. If I'm a highly literate AI engineer, know how to build my loops effectively and steer the architecture, the tools to do those parts already exist with AI.\n\nOutreach is already being done largely by AI, screening interviews can be done with something like Gemini Live, ElevenLabs for the voice, maybe Google's Video AI to watch the candidate for cues of cheating, maybe even Tavus (not quite there yet but will be soon) to make it feel more human. Go and try Gemini Live, it's genuinely a good experience and solves the recruiter knowledge problem. Then I can do mass analysis of candidates and present the best suited to the hiring manager.\n\nNow let's say I'm a competent AI engineer and want to build this. Sure it'll take me some time to get it right but nothings out of reach thats for sure. I could probably get a working prototype in a month if i get my head down on it. Get it right and i could charge pennies on the dollar for recruitment and still be wildly profitable.\n\nSo yes, for many people i think the end of cushty office jobs is upon them. But perhaps new things will open up we haven't worked out yet?",

These tools are massive accelerants for people who are talented and put effort into learning how to work with them effectively. In pre-AI times, software engineering people used to speak of the mythical \"10x engineer\" when referring to the outlier performers who do a majority of the real work needed to ship. I never witnessed a true 10x performance, but seeing high performers accomplish 2-4x the average output wasn't that uncommon. I think when fully ramped up on working with AI, high performers will become like 20-50x'ers which will remove the need for a lot of lower performing people in the fat part of the bell curve. As the number of worker bees declines there will be a proportional decrease in the overhead of admin, people management, and coordination roles (managers, HR, program management, etc) and further productivity gains from the reduced amount of consensus building and status update meetings. Even if the adoption curve lags behind the frontier, we're all in for a wild ride in the not-too-distant future.",

This is also true to pre-AI era. what was a 1 year project in 2010, was a 4 to 6 months in 2015 because libraries became better. Nontheless, you get a 1 year project because now customers wants more features, so the codebase is bigger. I don't think we will really lose jobs, if not for the short term. \n\nIt's called Parkinson's Law, is pretty well established. Productivity gains get absorbed by rising expectations rather than reducing workload. From a business perspective it also makes sense:  \n\\- if you build 100 with a team of 10, you can gain 10  \n\\- therefore, if you build 100 with a team of 5, you can gain 15  \n\\- but even smarter is to build 200 with the team of 10 you had in the first place, and gain 20  \nNow, not everybody will do it, but it's the smartest move to make. Build more to sell even more.  \n  \nThere's a lot of marketing going around AI companies, but just take a look at the numbers and you'll see they need to push since they're orders of magnitude away from being profitable in any way.",

For those who don’t know about those, I think this website (https://sites.math.duke.edu/education/postcalc/ode/ode1.html) does a good job at demonstrating and plotting what kinds of solutions you could have at a high level. One thing that I’ve always found interesting is we assume exponential growth, but most systems have an exponential initiation.  But not all systems grow exponentially in perpetuity. The most notable is the logistic curve. The one that shows promising exponential growth then plateaus almost instantly. My question is why does everyone always assume a continued, inexorable exponential growth?",

Over a short horizon, that can look like a clean exp curve even if the underlying system is piecewise: bursts when a new method/architecture lands, then diminishing returns until the next unlock. People also misuse exponentials as a proxy for compounding, which can be true even when the growth rate itself is declining. The logistic framing is probably closer to reality for any given bottleneck (data, energy, latency, alignment, deployment constraints), but the reason the debate keeps coming back is that the bottleneck might shift: you hit a plateau in one dimension, then a new technique or hardware cycle moves the carrying capacity and you get another apparent exponential segment. So the better model is less exponential forever and more stacked S-curves with uncertainty about where the next ceiling is and how quickly ceilings move.",

I teach AI to graduate students and we discuss this question with every new advancement.\nI think of advancement in general along similar mathematical lines as you and I suspect the shape of the curve is logistic, well,  step wise logistic. The history of advancement in AI has been step wise logistic and I've not seen any great evidence that's changed. \n\nWe just went through a rapid growth period and while we absolutely will see amazing feats of engineering and products and disruption from it, I do not expect improvements in the core technology (transformers) to continue at this pace. Problems with coherence, attention, alignment, and even physical resource limits are real problems not yet solved. \n\nThe core method of pretraining transformers is showing a slowdown. We've seen pretraining performance gains move from exponential looking to linear, while compute itself has become exponentially linked to those gains. Linear return for exponential input, that's a logistic shape right? \n\nWe've seen some techniques to push the boundry, or at least solve transformer related problems, each time we solve one of those problems we get a step up in intelligence. For example, as pretraining gains fall, reenforcement learning and inference time compute have stepped in and given us improvements, hence the step wise component of the curve.\n\nI think we will need another \"attention is all you need\" type revelation before we break out of the current asymptote. The history of this field has shown us two \"AI winters\" so far, I don't think we will see anything that drastic in terms of abandonment, but the big gains are already had and from here it's all consolidation. \n\n\nedit: I took so long to type this out no fewer than 3-4 other people have already pointed out stepwise sigmoid as a candidate. Turns out I still have never had an original thought. ",

And when the output feeds back into the input you usually end up getting exponentials.\n\nThe second is the horizontal scalability. Hinton talks about his worries regarding this in some recent interviews. But basically: we're now at the early stages of agentic AI. You can have a large number of semi-autononous workers doing their tasks online. Their \"IQ\" maybe gets improved only linearly, but they can all get the same update in an instant. So, if at some point the effective intelligence of the SOTA models is higher than a typical smart human.. you can plausibly have very large numbers of them. Limited by only cost. How does e.g. an AI research group with a million unusually smart, dedicated and tireless 24/7 workers sound like?",

Once learned this can be trained into the model to make the findings cheaper to apply.  We are limited on compute at the moment for this which is being built.\n\n3) Hardware improvements for AI is not slowing down.  AI is not a major part of chip development yet.  It's not smart enough. When it is then we'll see even more rapid growth of chips.  Eventually they'll get to the point where something like AlphaEvolve can run in minutes rather than months.\n\n4) There has been no slowing down of model improvements.  It feels like we are at the very start of this curve.  Also we are only applying ML to an few areas at the moment.  Lots of places also to harvest different kinds of data other than video and text.\n\n5) The agentic agent handlers seen to be very early.

That's what's exciting.  \nFor more clarification, I'd say that tech follows more of an S-curve. It slowly accelerates, then at a certain point, jumps up until it approaches its plateau. There's a dual-exponential in that curve. What's more interesting to consider though is the question \"what is the upper bounds of intelligence?\" When AI becomes capable of researching an learning independently of humans, and it has the combined intelligence of all of humanity, what would that growth curve look like?  \nI imagine we'll see a stair-step style graph as we are currently with AI. Every time someone says \"AI has hit a wall\" that's just the exponential taper-off while we wait for the next breakthrough that starts the next S-curve.  \nI can't even fathom what the ceiling is on intelligence - a complete understanding of the universe?

Even if they are only \"as good\" as top of the line AI researchers, they can be run in parallel at speeds arbitrarily faster than real time, they never get tired, and they don't age.\n\nNow, realistically that doesn't mean that someone is going to turn on an AI one day and it's going to suddenly speed-run becoming a god by solving all of physics or some nonsense. The systems will run into all sorts of limitations. Maybe they can design hardware, but the hardware has to be physically built, and the raw materials have to be mined. Maybe we build robots to do the mining and manufacturing, but that will be its own long term maturation cycle.\n\nThe AI 10 years from now will be exponentially better than the AI of today, but that doesn't mean runaway god-brain AI.

I don't think anybody knows where the inflexion point is, but history says every technology hits one - electricity, internet, mobile, all followed logistic adoption and capability curves. AI won't be the exception; the only debate is whether we're at 30% or 70% of the S-curve. My bet is we're much closer to the shoulder than most VCs want to admit. ",

But this is an oversimplified view which is ignoring resource/energy allocation and environmental impacts. Not only are you able to solve those problems, you require a relatively small amount of energy to do that (on top of your existence of course but that's a completely different topic). The main issue is that there's only one of you and historically it's been possible to scale computers way beyond humans. That was only possible because integrated circuits are incredibly power efficient and keep getting better and faster over time. Now this is extrapolated to AI but the energy demands are entirely different.",

A doubling of parameters will not mean a doubling of performance, so it might all just stabilise and be another thing at our disposal. Given the amount of cash flowing into AI right now, at least some more growth seems inevitable.

The bubble popped, but the capability stuck around and entrepreneurs slowly figured out what it was actually good for… how to make money off it.\n\nI feel we’re in a similar phase. Right now, Claude can already handle a huge portion of real software engineering work. Not perfectly, but enough that an experienced engineer can be 5x-10x if they know what they’re doing. That is not theory, that is happening in production workflows today at the top tech shops.\n\nAnd software is just the first domain that has been heavily optimized around AI. If model progress froze tomorrow, founders would spend the next decade operationalizing the same level of augmentation across law, accounting, marketing, research, ops, everything white collar. \n\nYou do not need superintelligence to reshape industries. You just need tools that are good enough to compress cognitive labor by 30 to 70 percent. \n\nThat creates economic pressure, and companies that use it well outcompete those that do not. It will not look like mass replacement overnight. It will look like fewer people doing more work, and over a decade that changes everything.",

The gains don’t come from one engineer moving faster. They show up when the entire org restructures around AI. Engineering, product, QA, planning, documentation, reviews. When everyone has AI native workflows and there’s real buyin, the latency between roles collapses. That’s where the multiplier is. My day to day feels like I'm playing Starcraft or some other resource management game.\n\nFor example, I can close a couple tickets while drafting the technical outline for an upcoming refactor. That outline goes to product, who use AI to quickly turn it into a structured set of like 30+ scoped tickets with acceptance criteria geared specifically to guide Claude's usage for both the Engineer and the QA teams. Instead of that taking days of meetings and back and forth, it happens in hours.\n\nMy team then implements with Claude, working on \\~3 tickets at a time in different CC instances. QA is using AI to generate broader regression coverage and validate flows faster, so they’re not stuck manually walking through everything. No one is suddenly a 10x engineer. The system just has way less waiting, context switching (in the traditional sense), and coordination drag, so throughput increases significantly.\n\nA massive refactor or big new feature that would have taken months from ideation to deployment, takes days.",

I think it can easily 10x the productivity of designers, QA, product - not sure about devs. It’s not talking to a chatbot; it’s setting up automation with robust checks. Or, amazingly bespoke software for incredibly esoteric uses. \n\nIt seems like that should be adopted SO quickly. But, it’s really hard to scale within an org. Some people just “get it” and some people just don’t. It’s just a tool, and you have to know how to use it. Not to mention the security concerns. \n\nSo, I think there is a not yet solved gap in scaling it that prevents it from being as disruptive as it sometimes seems like it should be. True story: I talked to the person at the desk of a lumber yard and they were doing pay roll with a tape calculator. Knew it was silly but just didn’t care. Even in big seemingly forward companies, that kind of apathy toward increasing productivity is pretty strong. Not even is sweaty to work.\n\nI think few careers will be wiped out but many will be severely compressed. There will also be winners. I think SWEs are actually pretty fine. It sucks to be junior right now, but, as compelling as AI is in the hands of a senior dev, the industry will eventually need to replenish senior devs. I think some of the hype will die down and it will be less doom and gloom in tech, for most roles outside of QA and design.",

It’s going to change everything and the only question is what year is the tipping point.\n\nFor everyone here who says “I would never go to a robot barista” they said that about ATMs in the 80’s. Will there be ‘for humans by humans’ coffee shops? Of course. Like there are people still going to a plays instead of seeing a movie.\n\nBut would you rather sit in a doctor’s office for an hour, see the doctor for 5 minutes to get your penicillin prescription, then get a bill from your health insurance company for hundreds of dollars for that 5 minute visit? Or talk to an AI and get your prescription approved in 5 minutes (or the test authorization to confirm the medication will actually cure the illness based on the symptoms you present?) And then the bill is exponentially smaller. The robot doc creates the notes logging the cpt codes and directly submits the bill to the insurance company. No more medical billers on both sides of the transaction….people submitting claims and rejecting claims.\n\nEvery info worker position will be affected. It’s already started in tech and already started in marketing. Entire graduating classes with degrees in these fields will end up with 6 figure student loans and a fraction of the jobs that used to exist.\n\nAgain…the only question is not IF but WHEN.\n\nThen the next question is…if you are a [insert info worker job here… CSR, Accounts Payable, Operations, etc…] what do you do when 80% of those positions are wiped out and the only jobs left are the robot managers?\n\nMicrosoft and Anthropic are saying 2 years out. I think that it’s a little longer because tech implementations are not foolproof (yet.) They were predicting this 10 years ago with RPA technologies but the RPA platforms never had a brain. The llms do.\n\nMy guess is around 4-5 years out but definitely less than 10 years. I have worked in tech for over 25 years and I have NEVER seen this much high quality change in such a short time frame.\n\nClaude built and launched coworker in a couple of weeks. In the old days that would be a 12 month project at a minimum (and FWIW it’s pretty spectacular.

          "text": "> Yet in the real world society doesn’t seem to care all that much. It just feels strange that supposedly AI is going to mass replace traditional jobs sometime in the next 10-20 years yet everyone is still doing the same degrees at university, isn’t stressed about their future, and just generally ignoring the massive changes that are soon to come.\n\nThis is a fundamental, significant problem that I am increasingly concerned about.\n\nI have three concerns about AI:  \n\n* Catastrophic misalignment, \n* Bad actors weaponizing AI\n* Societal/Cultural lack of preparation for AI-induced change.\n\nThat final point being the particularly relevant one here.\n\nWe can't know what the future holds, but we can see enough to know that the likelihood AI-induced job displacement is very high.  It can be seen coming by the people who are paying attention.  But we're not really doing anything about it because people still can't agree that it's a problem.\n\nThe majority of people I interact with seem to fall into one of a couple camps:\n\n* AI is a fad that will fail and leave the techbros penniless when the 'bubble' pops, while I will remain untouched. (A market bubble can exist, probably does in some respects, without the tech being a 'fad'.  The dotcom bubble didn't kill the internet.)\n* AI may or may not be a problem but I have bigger things to worry about and can't add AI to the list (honestly, relatable and understandable, but also unproductive)\n* The AI that we have (mostly LLMs) is just a stochastic parrot, a fancy autocomplete that has no soul and will never have human ingenuity, therefore it won't lead to job displacement. (Neither human ingenuity or a 'soul' is needed for mass job displacement).\n* AI is a sci-fi level threat and all AI research needs to stop immediately. (We cannot put the toothpaste back into the tube.  tech that can be used to find 500 zero-day vulnerabilities and flag them for fixes is the same tech that can find those same vulnerabilities so as to exploit them.  Tech that understands human biology, pathogens, and carcinogens enough to cure cancer and disease is also tech that can develop novel bio-weapons.  We can't pump the brakes, it's a matter of sovereign security for everyone at this point).\n\nAI is coming, it's going to change the world, and it can't and shouldn't be slowed down.  What needs to happen instead is an *acceleration* of social and cultural preparation.  Elon Musk talks about \"Universal High Income\" and how no one needs to save for the future any more, because in the future we'll all be ultra-wealthy.  Which sounds great in theory, but doesn't just *happen*.  We need to be exploring options like universal basic income, universal basic services, public-funded AI research for maters of public interest (climate repair, fusion energy, healthcare advancements) and more.  But we're not, and probably won't.\n\nChange doesn't happen without semi-united public pressure, and we're not united.  Worse, the discussion around AI is increasingly finding ways to slot itself into the existing political divisions in society (because, at least in my country, partisan politics infects *everything*) which leads people to become further entrenched in their presuppositions and biases.  And there are LOADS of really smart sounding people with very high production quality content putting out anti-AI content that's perpetuating outright falsehoods to support an anti-AI narrative, falsehoods that people pretty readily accept because it reinforces their biases (some examples:  Benn Jordan recently put a video about datacenters in which he talks about pollution around a well-known datacenter and to support this he talks about how badly it stinks nearby.  He neglects to mention that the datacenter in question is next to a very large water treatment plant which is absolutely *foul* to smell and was known to be a stinky area well before the DC was built there.  Another good example is the viral 'understanding' that AI datacenters consume vast amounts of water and are depleting the water supply, even though this is pretty easily disprovable).\n\nWithout some broad agreement on what's coming and how to fix it, we're heading towards massive social and cultural upheaval pantsless.  And when the change does come, when masses of people who have worked under a pre-existing paradigm to do all the right things to put themselves into successful positions suddenly have that paradigm shift and - through no real fault of their own - find themselves jobless, then that social pressure to implement change happens, but it happens *all at once* with significant urgency.  And that's where things get real messy.\n\nAnyway, sorry to ramble.  I could probably run this through AI to make it more readable and coherent but I hope you get the gist.  I'm open to any respectful dialogue on the subject.",

Anyone that has tried to use AI to make, say, video games knows these models still lack even rudamentary understanding of a number of problems. It’s not a lack of understanding per se, it’s a lack of internalized experience, if you will. In other words, if you tell it ”make this character move like this toward that goal”, it has no ability to build five different versions of this instance and then to clearly make the correct call of WHICH of these five implementations is the best. In fact, it lacks the ability to even judge if whatever implementation it decided for is viable.\n\nCurrent AI models are pure executers. They execute incredibly well, to the point where whatever they executed on is never thoroughly analyzed through a ”was this the correct implementation?” lens. \n\nSure, writing boilerplatr code is very binary; understanding ”correct implementation” in those cases is straightforward. But to do so in all the endless permutations of real world environments and situations - or for that matter even *one* - is a fundamentally different ballgame when it comes to ”understanding”. A understanding that comes from internalized experience; ie a heuristic that emerges into our brain based on vast amounts of datapoints drawn from our past. \n\nCan AI solve this in the future? Of course, human problem solving is after all done in the brain, which is a machine. But it requires something fundamentally different than current chatbots/code writers.\n\nUntil then, some industries and professions will be affected, mainly ones based on expert knowledge (law, accounting, financial research etc). Ie professions where your edge lies in applying very specific knowledge in specific cases. But for everything else, the jury is still out. \n",

Those who can't, or won't use them will probably get left behind.  It's not really hard to use, after all, you mostly only need to use natural language.

          "text": "Apologies for the essay, I wanted to collect my thoughts on this topic too. Predicting the future is obviously very hard, especially 20 years down the line. Keep in mind that we can’t expect anyone to behave “rationally” because most are uninformed and even the informed are (or should be) extremely uncertain. So don’t read too much into anyone’s behaviors surrounding AI as an actual signal for whats to come. I’ll start with a summary of where we are and then give my best guess as to whats next.\n\nAs of today, AI has made most forms of writing and imagery extremely accessible to the average person for free. With a bit of money, we also have access to short, high resolution video generation and decently functioning code up to a few thousand lines. This alone has had a huge effect on copywriting jobs and commission-based artwork, which understandably has also led to an anti-AI sentiment. It has also led to an increase in spam, fake media, and a general lack of trust in the internet (which we maybe should have always had)\n\nIt has so far had less of an effect on software engineering and video where small snippets of high quality work aren’t necessarily enough to put together a useful final product. Large companies are heavily using agents to implement routine features, but this simply shifts the bottleneck to reviewing code, which still requires an expert engineer. Smaller project get fewer benefits without strong code standards and testing infrastructure. However, animation and certainly software engineering are easier and will move faster than before. Software engineering is likely far more prepared and willing to integrate automation than animators, so it’s hard to say what the actual effect will be. Expect some smaller companies to hire slightly fewer engineers, but most companies will simply increase the scope of their projects to match.\n\nVery recently, LLMs have also become useful tools for some scientific research. They are able to automate some work of developing mathematical proofs, which is valuable for theoretical math and physics work. Although companies attempt to advertise their ability to automate scientific discover, all of these projects have so far required heavy human-AI collaboration.\n\nAI has certainly progressed extremely rapidly in the last 3 years. The first 2 years were driven by scaling supervised learning on massive datasets, meaning the models largely learned to imitate existing data. More recently, progress on coding, math, and general problem solving have been driven by reinforcement learning on verifiable problems, like passing a unit test for software, generating a logically valid proof, or solving a puzzle. The imitation learning path is unlikely to result in any shocking new abilities, and was starting to provide diminishing returns early last year. Reinforcement learning is a very powerful paradigm which has led to superhuman performance on constrained problems like Chess, Go, and Starcraft 2 in the past. However, this relies on verifiable rewards, and there are only so many proofs, test cases, and puzzles we can train on before we’ve exhausted that source of data.\n\nReinforcement learning and as a result LLMs still struggle with underspecified problems, or problems that require long horizon planning. They are notoriously bad at video games for this reason. It may take many years to solve these fundamental challenges, and those solutions are crucial to fully autonomous systems that can satisfy long-term goals. LLMs are still extremely unreliable and overconfident, and their responses are unpredictable despite a monumental research effort to address those weaknesses. They are incapable of permanently learning new information, and while their attention spans have improved, they still easily lose track of things and get confused on complex tasks. Most importantly, until we solve those problems, AI is best used with a human in the loop, heavily involved with decisions making. Therefore, those problems mist be solved before we have full automation.\n\nSo, current technology is already having an impact on some jobs and how we interact with technology. We should expect those current trends to continue (more spam and fake news stories, more disruption of jobs that largely produce writing/images, growing social importance). Current AI technology is not AGI and I believe there are several extremely difficult problems to solve before we can build AGI. However, it is truly intelligent in some ways, and will become an invaluable tool for most jobs, like google search or specialized software are. Within 5 years I expect most small software projects will be able to be written from a single prompt with no errors. With software engineering being so accessible, most jobs that are capable of being automated with software will become automated. This was already happening slowly as people made the investments into software, but it will happen much faster now that anyone can simply request software to solve their specialized problem. I expect that in 30 years, we will have solved most of the fundamental problems in AI and we will be well on our way to automating most work, at which point things get very weird. I don’t believe that will soon.",

Think trades, nursing, teaching, agriculture, service workers.\n\nWhile it's possible to have AI or robots do various things, we still have to move at the speed of humans with much of it. You can only optimise so much before you hit a natural bottleneck. In theory you could have a plumber that is a robot, but with the complexity of that it's going to be easier and cheaper just to have a human do the work (and that is the case for so many jobs). The more complexity in a system, the more can go wrong. Society and governments can only move so fast, and most people don't want to be pioneers in how they do their work - they just want to get the job done and will use whatever software is given to them.\n\nThere's also the social aspect. Humans aren't machines, and if we have machines making all the decisions you end up with a disconnected society that is getting pissed off pretty quickly with it all. I'm a big user of technology, but in daily interactions I'd much rather deal with a person than an unthinking AI.\n\nYes there will be big changes, but the idea that we have some completely automated society (especially with a debt-based capitalist economy) is ridiculous.

Internet will be locked down. The uk/aus safety laws for example will ultimately be policed by backend Ai and the internet will be run by a very powerful few billionaires. We wont own anything and be monitored by \"smart gadgets\" 24/7. Likely a chinese style social ctedit score system will be implimented by goverments to keep people in check. Universal basic income will be implimented in some form to make up for job losses and goverments will impliment a national service system to obtain the baseline data of every citizen.\n\nHowever the positive is people will disconnect from the internet and the world will become simplier. People will go back to older traditions. Writing, reading and social interaction away from the machines. Health related business will thrive. Gyms. Dance. Yoga. Table top games, human sports etc will all thrive.\n\nPeople are already deleting social media at a vast rate and already nothing you see online is potentially real you realise what a waste of time it is.\n\nJobs will be focused locally and local economies will find a resurgence due to the shitshow the \"internet\" will have become. My engraving business, 3d printers etc will have a place in a localised economy. \n\nIts possible countermeasures against AI are created as well. Methods of protecting work through clever signitures for example. Using AI to to trace AI use. Laws and transparancy about your own useage of ai will come into effect. But only time will tell generally how effective these things will be.\n\nCertainly an intresting time to be alive.",

I may not have the most amazing professional record yet given I'm a recent graduate and party a lot, but at uni I was so mental I studied 12-16 hours a day for years. I gained a level of understanding of the economy where I can genuinely say 90% of the people talking on the economy don't know what they're talking about, even folks like Jerome Powell and half the fed, they know some things but they're missing huge chunks of critical information, such as what actually causes inflation. Obviously nobody listens without the professional background, but I'd at least argue my understanding of the economy is top tier (think 10,000+ hours studying). Also getting top grades in professional qualifications. \n\nBusinesses employ people to produce goods and services that they can sell for more than they pay for their workers and materials. If AI makes it possible to produce far more products and services for each person they employ, then each employee is going to generate far more profit. They may need to adjust prices, and the variety of products/services may need to expand, but the profit maximising strategy is to employ more people, purchase more capital goods, and produce drastically more goods and services. It isn't to fire everyone and produce the same amount as now for the same price and sell it back to themselves. Employing workers just became more profitable. We're going to be fine. \n\nWorkers will, however, not benefit from any of the increase in productivity, except in certain countries that strictly regulate the labour market to keep it fair. Poverty won't improve in developed countries. Inequality will continue growing. The working class eventually won't own anything with the ability to generate income, and they for damn sure are not going to be happy about it. Revolution or authoritarianism by the rich, that's the path we're heading down. Perhaps a form of neo-feudalism.

I've already built a number of MVP/prototype apps that work (I wouldn't release them to the public as-is, but it's certainly feasible to apply SWE best-practices to codebase to make production-ready apps that aren't a complete security nightmare).\n\n\nI can also translate documents/books with over 90%+ accuracy in a fraction of the time (and cost) that a human translator would cost me, I can have a small, dedicated AI model fine tuned to learn my style of writing and convert my draft notes into fully-formatted documents in a fraction of the time, I generate docs/books into a print-ready PDF/ePub at the click of a button, and much, much more already.\n\n\nSo, why would I increase my cost base *significantly* by hiring people to do any of these particular tasks anymore? Humans aren't perfect at their jobs (so neither are AI models), but now I can automate the most mundane aspects of a particular workflow, freeing me up to provide quality control on the final output.\n\n\nAlso, agentic models (i.e. AI models that can access tools/programs on your computer) mean they can all get actual work done (Vs just talking to you) or even communicate with eachother (when set up properly), giving you a mini team of workers that can actually crack on with the job at hand and genuinely get stuff done.\n\n\nUltimately, AI is a tool - nothing more, nothing less. Which means that the right person, using the right model(s), in the right way, at the right time and for the right reasons, will always be multiple steps ahead in the future over those who don't take the time to learn how to use them.\n\n\nFinally, this is the worst it's *ever* going to be. Only 6 months ago I was copying and pasting code from AI to my code base. Now, I can watch it *think out loud* and it writes the code, updates my internal documentation (to my style guide), and runs automated tests and bug fixes by itself.\n\n\nThen there's the fact that offline models are becoming more and more capable, smaller (to an extent), and hardware is becoming more capable, so it's becoming increasingly more viable to build hybrid AI toolchains that combine online and offline Ai model usage.\n\n\nSo, AI has already changed my future - massively. I knew the writing was on the wall for me as a Technical Author back in 2024 with the release of GPT-4, and I can't see AIs progress slowing down anytime soon.\n\n\nThe place where I worked at before are already pushing through AI usage for all technical authoring work, and my ex-colleagues are - rightfully - nervous about what that means for their jobs. Being able to understand how it works (and how to be the one that supervises the output) will put them (and anyone else in a similar position) in the strongest position possible in the future.",

I do not have any direct answer to your question here is what I retained with my understanding and opinion. Forget 5-10 years, think in months ! Some major AI's programming have been completely reprogrammed/relearned since December. This is the sort of advancement, me, the average Joe end user do not see in the day to day ...yet.  This new capacity seems to be limited by physical capacity (Data center, energy, and devices). The price of ram memory seems to have increased a lot and probably will continue. Personal computers and phones prices will increase a lot because their present  capacity will soon be obsolete if AI with new capacity applications are used. Where is that new capacity will go from here, no idea.\n\nCommercially and industrially AI will accelerate the development of robotics. That (robotics) will change rapidly in the 5-10 years range. It will will permit constant new calculations and adjustment by AI instead of programming by algorithms and  and being limited from there. As an example think autonomous cars that have to assimilate all live information as data that is never the same at one moment/place. Same thinking for robots that have to constantly adapt instead of simply do repetitive operations.   \n\n  \nFor the jobs, both events I attended yesterday had the same opinion. People will not use their jobs because of AI. They will lose their jobs and businesses because they do not use AI and their competitors do. And even if AI and robotics replace a certain amount of jobs, in the current job market it is not an bad thing because the baby boomer job force is getting out of the market and new workers either will not go into those trades or are not in sufficient number to replace the amount of people who will retire. \n\nI think it is definitely a change like internet was. It,is going to be a transition. Average joe's like me will use AI more and more often in everyday life without realizing it (phones (we already do), cars, apps, computers, professional tools etc...) It's going the be everywhere fast, get advantage of it         ",

It’s the sane path and one that the AI models today are very consistent about. \n\nReplacement will be sought and is inevitable as a temptation. To think of it as only greedy CEO types will do this is IMHO a lie. I see replacement as bound to fail, and I long to wager with those who see it as a given. I don’t think they have thought the matter through. To me, replacement is the old paradigm grasping at what makes sense for humanity moving forward as we aren’t all that prepared for the new approach (intellectually). Emotionally, the new approach is I think highly desirable, but admittedly, I can relate to why it is perceived as fearful since our identity is on the table for being erased. \n\nI think like most big changes, we are getting a lot wrong early on and hindsight will have us see it as truth was there the whole time, but conjecture and (pseudo) logic had us imagining another scenario was more likely.",

In fact, we are strictly prohibited from using any AI for our tasks.  \n\nWe exist as a company because of our proprietary information.  We know stuff.  We don’t tell others the stuff we know.  If we did, we would lose our edge.  The stuff we learned came at a high cost and accumulated over lots and lots of time, effort, testing, experience, and money.  It’s the true value of the company.  We simply must protect that knowledge at all costs. \n\nIn order to get AI to do things for us here, at least from a mechanical engineering standpoint, we need to feed it our proprietary information to some degree.  Can we trust that AI will keep that information to itself?  \n\nWhat about our customers sensitive information?  Same thing.  Can we trust that AI is secure and that the information stays in the proper hands?\n\nMy place of employment has an even deeper need for security as well because we do work for government military contracts. We have strict security procedures in place.  So in those situations, the risks are greater. \n\nBecause of all of this, I think a lot of companies will be slow to adopt.  Companies need to adopt so they aren’t left in the dust but they need to pump the brakes to ensure they simply don’t give away all their hard earned trade secrets and tribal knowledge.  \n\nI’m personally of the opinion that my company’s reluctance to adopt AI bodes well for my job security.  At least for now.  If AI can start designing things better than we can without having our proprietary knowledge, then I think AI will be at a point where no job is safe.  At that point, we’re all in the same boat.\n\nI also see a bottleneck in manufacturing.  Not so much for labor once robots become capable and affordable but for testing and prototyping.  AI may someday be able to optimize a mechanical design on paper, but reality rarely cooperates with what works on paper.  \n\nIf AI can churn out designs at lightning pace, what does it matter if we still need to iterate through testing real products in the real world.  Someday, even the prototype build and test could become automated but I feel that is still much further out than 2 to 5 years.  \n\nI envision a pile of unproven designs and ideas created by AI and not enough resources to test and build.  At that point, I think we may all shift to fill the roles needed to try and open up that bottleneck.  I imagine a large demand for blue collar labor and shop managers. \n\nHeck, it takes a year or more to build and test a single prototype for some of the projects I work on.  Things are going to get weird for new product development.  Very weird.",

I know there's a lot of hype around AI, but think about it, what are viable use cases where you can actually rely on AI without doubt or have minimal supervision? \n\nSomeone said AI today is what the internet was in 1996, and I strongly disagree lol. The internet was a robust platform, still is. What does AI do that wasn't already possible besides in very niche cases like say protein folding or other research. All you have rn is a search engine that you can talk to and that has some memory. Replace chat bots with it. That's pretty much it, no? \n\nThe issue isn't with potential use cases, there are millions of them. The issue is with reliability and a fundamental problem with how modern systems work. You cannot have a general purpose model without foundationally altering modern DL architecture. There are some steps being taken in that direction (JEPA, SSMs, etc) but it's FARRRRR AWAY from being robust, and MILES AWAY from being interpretable. \n\nInternet allowed people to move their businesses online, allowed for ads, allowed for international communication. AI just doesn't have that huge of an impact and comes at a huge cost (both climate and energy needs). \n\nIt's far from perfect. So to answer your question, at least the next 5-10 years there isn't gonna be a huge difference, maybe 15-20 years later yes, we'll see changes. \n\nDon't think of it as a virtual superhuman doing all your tasks for you. Think of it as a paraplegic dog who's constantly on the internet but with amnesia and can talk. There's a lot yet to be done, and so much more when talking about large scale use. Don't worry too much about software engineering either. \n\nEven the best LLMs fail at long term planning and cannot think out of the box. If anything, it just makes life simpler for SDEs, who earlier had to code large scale systems from scratch. LLMs can just reliably (70-80% of the time works) help you code. You still gotta plan, design and test your systems. \n\nDon't worry too much about it, just be open to AI, and don't dismiss it. It's a useful tool, but that's all it is right now, a tool, not your replacement.",

          "text": "I’ll just leave this here.. you can reverse engineer the prompt! 😂\n\n“Now we’re at the real fault line.\n\nThe economic question isn’t “can AI do it?”\n\nIt’s:\n\nWho carries the liability when it fails?\n\nThat determines everything.\n\nLet’s walk through it cleanly.\n\n⸻\n\n1. The Current Legal Reality (Right Now)\n\nToday, in almost every jurisdiction:\n\nAI providers are not liable for your business decisions.\n\nOpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, etc. structure their terms so that:\n\t•\tThey provide a tool.\n\t•\tYou are responsible for how you use it.\n\t•\tYou must verify outputs.\n\nSo if:\n\t•\tAn AI drafts a legal memo incorrectly\n\t•\tAn AI writes defective code\n\t•\tAn AI produces faulty financial analysis\n\t•\tAn AI misclassifies an insurance claim\n\nThe liability falls on:\n\nThe human or company deploying the AI.\n\nNot the model provider.\n\nLegally, AI is treated like:\n\t•\tExcel\n\t•\tA calculator\n\t•\tA word processor\n\t•\tOr a spell checker\n\nIt is considered an assistive tool.\n\n⸻\n\n2. Why This Matters Economically\n\nBecause liability drives labor retention.\n\nIn any domain where:\n\t•\tErrors are expensive\n\t•\tHarm is high\n\t•\tRegulation is strong\n\t•\tLicensing exists\n\nHumans cannot disappear.\n\nExamples:\n\nReviewing insurance claims\n\nIf an AI wrongly denies a legitimate claim and causes harm:\n\t•\tThe insurer is liable.\n\nDrafting legal memos\n\nIf bad analysis causes malpractice:\n\t•\tThe law firm is liable.\n\nMedical documentation\n\nIf an AI misses critical info:\n\t•\tThe physician is liable.\n\nAI does not absorb professional responsibility.\n\n⸻\n\n3. The Real Transition We’re Likely To See\n\nInstead of “AI replaces humans,” what we get is:\n\nAI performs first-pass cognition.\nHumans sign off.\n\nThis changes staffing ratios, not responsibility structures.\n\nFor example:\n\t•\t1 lawyer overseeing 5 AI-drafted memos\n\t•\t1 adjuster reviewing 200 AI-sorted claims\n\t•\t1 engineer validating AI-generated code\n\nResponsibility remains human.\nThroughput increases.\n\n⸻\n\n4. Could AI Providers Ever Be Liable?\n\nPossibly — but only if:\n\t•\tThey offer domain-specific guaranteed systems\n\t•\tThey claim medical/legal authority\n\t•\tThey integrate directly into decision execution\n\t•\tOr regulation forces it\n\nFor example:\n\nIf a company sells:\n\n“Fully autonomous AI claims adjudication, guaranteed compliant.”\n\nThen regulators would likely treat them as:\n\t•\tA licensed processor\n\t•\tA fiduciary agent\n\t•\tOr a regulated service provider\n\nAnd liability would attach.\n\nBut right now, they carefully avoid this positioning.\n\n⸻\n\n5. What About Insurance for AI?\n\nYes — this is already emerging.\n\nWe’ll likely see:\n\t•\tAI malpractice insurance riders\n\t•\tAI deployment liability coverage\n\t•\tErrors & omissions policies covering AI use\n\nJust like:\n\t•\tCyber insurance emerged\n\t•\tCloud hosting risk insurance emerged\n\nRisk gets priced.\nIt doesn’t disappear.\n\n⸻\n\n6. The Hidden Insight in Your Question\n\nYou’re intuiting something deeper:\n\nFor AI to truly replace humans,\nit must absorb responsibility.\n\nBut responsibility is not computational.\nIt is legal, moral, and institutional.\n\nAnd institutions move much slower than technology.\n\nThat’s a key friction point.\n\n⸻\n\n7. Historical Parallel\n\nWhen autopilot systems improved:\n\nPilots weren’t removed.\nThey were retained for liability and rare-event control.\n\nWhen algorithmic trading emerged:\n\nPortfolio managers weren’t eliminated.\nThey became oversight operators.\n\nWhen radiology AI improved:\n\nRadiologists weren’t replaced.\nThey became AI validators.\n\nThis is not a coincidence.\n\nLiability is sticky.\n\n⸻\n\n8. Where This Gets Very Interesting\n\nThe real economic compression happens in:\n\nMid-level cognitive labor\n\nWhere:\n\t•\tTasks are patterned\n\t•\tLiability is diffuse\n\t•\tOversight can be statistical\n\t•\tHuman review can be sampled\n\nThat’s where AI can reduce labor dramatically.\n\nBut high-accountability roles?\nThose stay human — at least formally.\n\n⸻\n\n9. The Deeper Political Economy Layer\n\nIf AI dramatically increases productivity but liability stays human, then:\n\t•\tCapital captures most of the upside.\n\t•\tLabor retains the downside risk.\n\t•\tResponsibility remains personal.\n\nThat asymmetry could create:\n\t•\tWage compression\n\t•\tJob stratification\n\t•\tRegulatory backlash\n\nWhich ties directly into your broader concerns about extractive systems.\n\n⸻\n\n10. The Real Answer\n\nSo who is liable?\n\nRight now:\n\nThe deploying organization.\n\nIn the future:\nPossibly:\n\t•\tThe deploying organization\n\t•\tPlus AI insurers\n\t•\tPossibly regulated AI vendors in high-stakes domains\n\nBut never:\n\n“The AI itself.”\n\nBecause law requires an accountable entity.\n\nAnd that’s a human or corporation.\n\n⸻\n\nNow here’s the real question I’d ask you:\n\nIf AI becomes good enough that humans mostly just rubber-stamp outputs…\n\nIs the “human oversight” meaningful?\nOr is it a liability theater?\n\nThat’s where the next fracture line is.”",

Anthropic has made note of several significant partnerships they've made with many companies using Claude/ClaudeCode, and ClaudeCode has accounted for 4% of GitHub public commits in 2026 (https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/claude-code-is-the-inflection-point).  While you can certainly find criticisms - some valid, some not - of Claude Code, it is far from being \"proven trash\".\n\nPublic speculation aside, OpenAI has not lost partnerships from NVIDIA and Microsoft.  Microsoft in particular continues to be OpenAI's primary cloud provider and is a 27% owner of OpenAI.  (https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/10/28/the-next-chapter-of-the-microsoft-openai-partnership/)\n\nRegarding OpenAI, the claim that they are \"more likely to be bankrupt by the day\" is, again, incorrect, or at least not objectively supported.  While it's certain that there are legacy financial institutions betting against AI in some capacity or another, there's still a significant amount of capital flowing into OpenAI just as there is with Anthropic, xAI, Google DeepMind, etc.",

But on the other it's going to eat up a lot of white collar jobs. Because while AI can't quite do it as well as them, it can do it faster and cheaper, and ultimately thats what people care about.\n\nThen there is also the middle area that I constantly see, where the makers of AI show off a tech that looks amazing, but in reality isn't really implementable in todays world. And won't be for at least another 5 to 10 years, due to legalities.\n\nIn criminal law, judges won't accept poorly AI written arguments in their courts. Even if it gets better, if a human doesn't know their argument back to front they'd be tossed out by a working judge. And criminal law always effects government policy. You might be able to get AI into property law, or to digitise a lot of stuff that makes looking for things in legal libraries easier, or maybe to rubber duck a legal arguments, but if you don't know your legal arguments and you haven't checked your precedents you'd be screwed. And if you used AI and it hallucinated a case... its not worth the risk on a billion dollar or criminal law suit. You want people to check and recheck. It's faster. Not better. \n\nIn film and TV, there's similar problems. These new video models look amazing, but no studio or production company will use them right now because of the potential copyright issues in their training data, which makes them unuseable if they wanted to use them on a movie.  And then from a marketing perspective, theres the fact that 10% of the population won't touch anything to do with AI due to the slop tag. So would you really want to invest in a movie, that 10% of people won't watch from the jump? I know I wouldn't.\n\nSo the long and short of it is that in the areas where there are minimal legal hurdles it can and will be implemented. And fast. In others, due to reputational and legal issues it won't. Yet.\n\nRemember how we were all supposed to have parcels delivered by drones by now? It's not that tech doesn't exist, it does. But various laws won't let it happen on the scale that was promised.",

So you need to plan around it and this unknown uncertainty that might be there generally really suck.\n\nHowever, by driving, you might on average save 15 minutes a day, but in the short term, all these things you have to worry about are significantly more annoying than the benefit of saving 15 minutes.\n\nNow AI is this, but everything about it is unknown, and it could change anything you do.

Does anybody \"taught\" AI to solve sudoku specifically? Not. But they gave the input how sudoku should look like. And then it learned how everybody solved sudoku, so it imitates solving a sudoku. Look at how \"good\" AI at chess. It is still making blinders, also by illegal moves. It is not better than chessbots. But chess bot is also technically an AI.\n\nSo AI is still a software, just built differently. What AI is - big database with numbers in it to generate the most plausible answer. If I had billions of weighted dice I would also probably give a lot of correct \"guesses\".",

Instead, I set up processes to let AI quickly create variants by changing non-brand assets (eg backgrounds, copy, color, layout) on core assets that I still create from scratch. We are at the next stage where learnings from our live A/B tests will be ported into a repository which an agent will be able to pull from to inform variant creation so that all I have to do is review and approve. \n\nI’m doing that all as a one-man team at a small start-up. I did the same job at a big tech company and would have had two agencies/internal teams to do the same thing. When you understand how to apply the tool to processes, it’s a real game changer. \n",

AI is the next nuclear arms race.  You can tell by the way the US is strategically guarding technology.  If the US thinks China is developing better and faster AI to outthink them, then of course the US is gonna try to continue the cycle and be ahead of China, who will in turn do the same thing and the cycle perpetuates.  AI is such a wildcard right now that even small players could theoretically become important, so the small countries are likely throwing just as much as they can at it as well.  The chances of common-sense legislation stopping this are becoming vanishingly small.  The only thing I can really see slowing things down is if they nationalize the AI companies.  That used to would've been unthinkable, but the current administration has shown that they aren't above using out-of-left-field tactics like that.  ",

      "text": "***I am not anti-AI.***\n\nWhen I was a teen back in the 80s I was fascinated by AI. \"War Games\" was my favorite movie. It inspired me to write a few basic games (in BASIC!) that used AI. I've been following the developments since then.\n\nAI could be the best thing ever. AI could make education so much better, custom-tailored for each student. Provide affordable access to medical services, make public services cheaper and more efficient, advance science, make discoveries, etc. Basically, improve the lives of billions around the world, particularly those with lower resources today.\n\nUnfortunately we're not on that trajectory today.\n\nWe're the trajectory to replace workers (particularly knowledge workers for the benefit of corporations and CEOs. We're in the trajectory of creating billions of AI-addicted people through the exploitation of intimacy with chatbots. We're in the trajectory of mass unemployment, an explosion in loneliness and a future of state (or private) dependency unparalleled in history.\n\nAll of this brought to you by a handful of billionaires with inflated egos and no accountability, that feel entitled to decide the future of world, and for whom the collapse of society and the downfall of humanity are acceptable -and maybe even desirable- outcomes. The people forcing this on us are insulated from any consequences.\n\nSome of these CEOs have publicly said that there's a non-zero percentage chance AGI / ASI will exterminate us all.  I often hear the analogy of building a bridge. If you build a bridge and it would have a 10% chance of falling, would go across? Of course not. Its just not worth it.\n\nBut the analogy is just not complete. It doesn't really reflect the danger nor the accountability of those people building the bridge. A more accurate analogy would be like this:\n\n*There's a dozen people building a bridge, and it has a 10% chance of collapsing. They actually dont really know what's on the other side of the bridge, but they want ALL HUMANITY to cross the bridge, whether they like it or not. By the way, the 12 people building the bridge (and their families) all have parachutes and protection, so even if the bridge falls down, they will still be ok.*\n\n***I'm not anti-AI. I'm anti THAT AI. I'm anti dystopia by default.***\n\nI've been listening to a few people that share these concerns and I want to widen their message. In particular:\n\nCentre for Humane technology: [https://www.humanetech.com/](https://www.humanetech.com/)\n\nControl AI : [https://controlai.com/about](https://controlai.com/about)\n\nPlease do have a listen what they saying.\n\nOne common theme about these two organizations is that they saw ground-level resistance and voicing opinions is key. Companies and billionaires respond to incentives but also respond to public opinion. Silence is a green light.\n\nIf you don't want dystopia by default, take action. Spread the message.",

Even if you strip away the AGI-doom rhetoric, the nearer-term trajectory you describe is real: firms are incentivized to replace labor, maximize engagement, and treat human relationship as a product surface, and the social costs land on everyone else. At the same time, it's worth aiming the critique at mechanisms, not archetypes: procurement rules, liability, auditability, privacy law, labor policy, and competition policy are the levers that change outcomes regardless of who's in the CEO chair. If people want AI that helps instead of AI that extracts, the most effective organizing tends to look boring: push for clear standards, third-party testing, data rights, limits on manipulative use cases, and real consequences for reckless deployment. That's how you turn anti dystopia by default into something that actually steers the tech.",

That's the chokepoint, not the algorithm. And that's a much harder problem to democratize than software.\n\n  \nThe good news: inference costs are dropping roughly 10x per year at equivalent performance. What cost $200/month 18 months ago costs $20 today. The economics are naturally pushing toward wider access. The bad news: if energy becomes scarce enough, the people who control the grid will decide who gets to run what — and \"a dozen tech bros\" becomes \"whoever has a power purchase agreement.\"\n\n  \nIf you're serious about preventing concentration, the focus should be less on regulating model outputs and more on building distributed energy and compute infrastructure.

Wikipedia happened because the marginal cost of distributing knowledge collapsed to effectively nothing.\n\nNo company nobly chose to give away maps, email, video calls, GPS navigation, or infinite cloud storage tiers. Competition plus near-zero replication cost made charging for them harder than giving them away.\n\nAbundance doesn’t mean corporations wake up generous.

When intelligence itself becomes cheap to replicate, the cost of producing software, media, research, design, and even entire businesses drops toward zero. Companies will still compete, but they’ll compete in a world where the underlying production is nearly free.\n\nAnd the internet didn’t fail because abundance is impossible. It proved abundance is destabilizing. It destroyed gatekeepers, collapsed entire industries, and rewired how power flows. The chaos wasn’t a bug. It was the system adjusting to a new economic reality.\n\nThe age of abundance doesn’t arrive politely. It arrives like a flood.",

Interestingly, while every other computer maker is raising their prices because of skyrocketing RAM, Apple appears to be keeping their pricing near constant.\n\nRumors are that the new $599 M5 Mac Mini base model will be lightyears beyond any other base model on the market, but Apple keeping the baseline pricing the same... presumably because they think they'll make it back with new subscription services, but even so, customers appreciate not jacking up prices.",

It can write 10k lines in an afternoon and then go round in circles making bugs.  So you have to try to read and understand code you did not think off and a lot of it or keep prompting the AI and try to lock it down from going in circles (fix a bug only to make new ones).\n\nAlso it can produce a lot of unnecessary code which it itself doesn't know is unnecessary.   Or very bespoke code so it looks like it works but it does not consider the broader picture.\n\nAn no, there us no perfect unit testing, spec draft, interviewing or solution that will solve that.  When you go to design something there are just so many things to consider and the AI is just gonna guess at them. \n\nReviewing each line can help.  It is slower but more accurate.  Specifying each specific class etc... can work but also slow initally.  However it still is tedious and still error prone.\n\nI am not saying it is not useful but I think most devs have realized at this point it has some tradeoffs.",

Previously we automated physical effort or time consuming tasks. We made work physically easier and would take less time. But we never automated thinking. Humans still had to think and solve problems. Now the implementation of the solution is what we made easier. But AI automates thinking, or atleast thats what they are aiming to achieve soon. So now if an AI can think like a human and do work like a human. What will a human do? Any new jobs we will create will be given to the AI agents because they will eventually be better than humans at thinking and solving problems. Thats my theory atleast. Thoughts?",

Math calculations are not physical effort.\n\nYou are not taking the concept of demand elasticity into account.\n\nThe computer automated Math calculation.  The demand went way up with the needs of developing nuclear weapons and the H-bomb in particular.  And the electronic computer offered a cheap way to fulfill this demand for millions or billions of human computers. It did the work of millions or billions of humans, but it did not drive billions out of work.\n\nThe computer made is cheaper to do stuff that was previously too expensive to do.  So more got done.  This is an example of demand elasticity,\n\nAI may have to truly understand the real world to cheaply automate creativity, planning, complex communications, analysis of requirements, supervision, and management in the context of an enormous increase in demand.  Otherwise, there may be sufficient human jobs.\n\nHow soon will AI be able to meet its energy demand without employing humans?",

The land gets rain and snow, and it soaks in the ground.  No plants pull it out.  so they have 2 years rain to grow 1 year's crop.  \n\nThey already have smart spray machinery.  100 feet wide.

It's expensive.  It takes a very expensive tractor to pull it.  And a farmer's time.  What if smart drones could do that instead?  You're movign a lot less equipment.  Lot less fuel.  Not packing the soil as much.  If it's well automated, then the farmer can spend time not drving tractor.  Yeah, someone has to fill the beast's tanks with roundup.  Done right howevber, they come back, dock, charge, and the farmer fills all 20 of them at once, and they run off and do another few strips.  ",

Lower wages.\n\nAs an engineer in aerospace who has worked on tools to automate development activities for decades now, always seems like the new tools create opportunities and we end up needing more people.

I don’t believe we’re anywhere near that point yet however I do see that in the future. With each advancement new jobs are created however eventually that won’t be the case. \n\nEven with my limited AI and coding knowledge I’ve developed a home AI network assistant that has not only read access but write access also for various systems. Just the other day it managed to diagnose a corrupted FreeBSD network stack after testing the system network, dhcp, switch connectivity etc. It even has access via IPMI to access the system to eventually recompile a new stack. Voice recognition and speech capabilities so it’s like having an actual assistant there. It worked the problem explaining each step. It must wait for my verification before issuing root commands with some exemptions like restarting services. \n\nI mean the entire system, 8 VMs with one AI, could have literally problem solved and corrected the issue on its own if I allowed it to. For now I don’t since I still find a few mistakes occasionally. Still… this is what I’ve been able to do with AI in less than 6 months. Tell me a team of developers, coders and engineers couldn’t do this professionally on a huge scale and replace entire IT teams later savings companies millions+ in salaries, benefits, etc.  \n\nSure, they aren’t 100% correct right now but with new technology and how fast we’re advancing… many current IT jobs will definitely be replaced with AI. Coding, system administration, etc type jobs… a single person will be able to manage soon what a dozen or 100s or 1000s do today.\n\nI’ve honestly been blown away by how much I’ve been able to move forward with this project that started out as asking ChatGPT if a local AI could fully maintain and update a network documentation wiki for me. I added remote log monitoring, network monitoring, voice capabilities etc..\n\nHeck, it even uses the rooms camera to recognize my wife anytime she walks in and behaves as if I’m caught… “quick get dressed, your wife just walked in”! In a sultry female voice. 😆 Yeah.. my wife near collapsed the first time she walked in after that. 🤣\n\nI’ve got a good inquisitive mind, have developed a strong detailed system prompt and spent a few weeks researching AI communication queries which has really helped.",
