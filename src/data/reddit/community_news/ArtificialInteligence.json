              "text": "I do not want to be rude - but personally, it seems that people using frontier LLM’s are able to confuse *their own* limitations with the systems limitations.\n\nI played around for years with it (as a SWE biding my time) and when it became difficult to poke the traditional holes, paid for a pro plan and as a test just saw how much of my job I could automate. Well, it did it all, and more. I now only interact with it when a new model is released and see how much more capable it is, then close it.\n\nMy experience:\n\n- 2022, fun stories. My first prompt was about my dog and Tiger Woods hanging out. GPT crafts a silly story about them winning the ‘golden putter’ or something. I was horrified. Stress tested via knowledge I know to be true. It was kinda like talking to someone who just woke up from a 5 year coma. Kinda makes sense, suggestions kinda out of date. \n\n- 2023, idk whether it was model progress or user progress but, “search engine with context.” Example: “I need to build a service that does ____. Where do I start?” and research documentation from there.\n\n- 2024, impressive capability with code blocks. I’m able to get a template function that does X and remove their variables and substitute my own. Maybe 50% of the time it’s worth it.\n\n- 2025, its templating things like json for me when I say “I need .json for this static thing. Set up the template for me with these fields, and any relevant fields I may need.” At *some* point, I realized it truly was only fucking up when I changed something and forgot to make it aware of the changes. Vomit, despair - “Prompt Engineering” started saving me time.\n\n- January 2026, it’s unbelievable. Unrecognizable. People who say “I’m an SWE, it’s nothing don’t worry” start to look like malicious liars with *really full pockets* to me, more than the terrified guys at the top saying “this could replace you.” When I stress test it via personal insight, I see no errors or flaws to a deep degree. I isolate a CLI agent in docker on a separate machine than anything I’m using. In 5 hours, I set up a system where I receive a survey from GPT, I answer it, and it generates an app based on my responses it thinks I need. Zero bugs. Works out of the box. Apps weren’t great at first, but over time they have gotten more and more refined. I do not use the apps, I am just watching how this little system I have set up evolves. I say “make it prettier” and it does, with no extra guidance. I am humbled, terrified.\n\nNow, I look at the layoffs and wonder, is this it? Are we seeing it? No one is coming to save them. Certainly not the free market, and this is a big shakeup. I look at other countries and AI. I look at the fact that open source models exist - it cannot be stamped out. When one country is able to automate and keep people happy - oh boy. I do not know what will happen. If there were adults in the room, it’d be fine. No, it’s not a new technology. But its capabilities as it relates to the public are new. If the tech has plateaued or plateaus soon, it could already revolutionize everything.\n\nSo when you say “it’s hype man,” I’m curious. Are you naive and lying, or am I? Are you able to genuinely consider the same question? If nothing I wrote sounds implausible to you and you still say “it’s hype,” then I am relieved because clearly there are MUCH more capable and intelligent people on top of this than me, the lowly worker who needs to skill up.",

To answer this question, I took the best models from ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini and ran them through CS 2112 at Cornell University, the hardest first semester CS class offered.

No I don't mean one that needed constant handholding and prompting and revision by an engineer. I mean a legitimate working application that it built from zero. I would genuinely love to see and use it.\n\nAdditionally, a step further, what kind of applications are we talking about here? Are we talking about the most commonly produced CRUD apps out there that every new grad can copy via instructions? Because it just doesn't seem impressive that a copy machine can make copies. Can it actually build something useful on its own? Can it make decisions that actually make sense so that impact is actually delivered in the real world? Can it contextualize the real world at all? \n\nAs far as I can see, AI is extremely good at looking the part. But when it matters, the facade falls away. \n\nAlso, if I wrong, which I very well could be, where is the evidence? I don't mean jobs data (lots of factors involved) I'm talking about the explosion in USEFUL software (not just an increase in git commits). If what you say is true, we should be seeing incredible leaps. Deepseek should be making cheaper to train, more widely available deepseeks, AI should be propelling itself so rapidly that SaaS should be dead. Every industry in the world should be easily showing and proving how AI is making a massive positive impact.\n\nInstead what I see is silicon valley CEOs doing everything in their power to convince people they need these tools and a slice of the engineering population being convinced simply because it can spit out functional code. \n\nA final question, why would a product so useful it can replace the human workforce, not even be able to sell itself to the public on its use case? This should be the hottest commodity on earth but instead these companies are resorting to ADS to desperately reconcile their gaping profitability problem. You think one of these things could give their CEO overlords some ideas about drumming up revenue some time soon?",

It may eventually get easy enough that any reasonably smart person can build software, as opposed to a reasonably smart person with special knowledge, which is how it’s been for the last 50 years. None of this is scary though, in my view. It’s exciting! Much will be accomplished. Many problems will be solved. Vastly more complicated problems will be undertaken and solved — things like drug discovery, astrophysics, ecology, biology, will all be solved by software that we can’t currently build because of the complexity.",

Relational database systems have been around for over 50 years, yet how many companies have stored tabular information in collections of Excel files saved on network shares up until recently, if not today?\n\nWhen the modern smartphone came about (which is now so powerful that it can literally encode 4K video and run local AI models), it changed things considerably, but maybe not as extremely as first predicted. \"There's an app for that\" was the slogan, suggesting that for every last niche need, there would be a tailor-made app. While that is true to some extent, I'd argue that a lot of people mainly use their phones for staples. Mail, news, calendar, authenticator apps, messaging, photos, the works. Conversely, looking at niche apps, it's sometimes still quite challenging to find one that isn't shoddy or cavalier with privacy.\n\nThe staples weren't first made possible with iPhone-style smartphones, they were already feasible on the older-fashioned smartphones (well, app-based TFA wasn't around at that time AFAIK) and before that, a lot were covered by PDAs (even navigation) which were designed to be sat in a cradle and sync all new data to your device so you'd then have it available on the go, even without an internet connection.\n\nTechnological capability alone is never the only and sometimes far from the most important driver. All the way back in the 1860s, the first facsimile machine was commercialized that allowed to transmit not just beeps but actual b/w images over telegraph lines. The American civil war was still ongoing at the time, so quite a mind-boggling achievement. But interest was limited due to a number of factors and it wouldn't be until the 1920s that wiring photos became commonplace.",

They needed billions in funding and the only way to do that was to convince investors that this technology would change the world. In reality, there are many bottlenecks preventing AI from ever achieving the real-world applications they promised. 95% of companies that deployed AI found no appreciable increase in productivity, and in most cases AI performs worse than their human counterpart. OpenAI and all these other companies know that AI is largely useless, which is why instead of letting users choose AI, they’re forcing it into spaces no one asked for, in many cases detrimental to the user experience. The chickens have come home to roost, and they need to justify the billions of investor dollars they spent. But AI has around a 3% paying customer base, meaning 97% of people willing to use AI aren’t willing to pay for it. My guess is because AI doesn’t really do anything that wasn’t already possible, at least for the average consumer.",

I do see some good use cases for LLMs, e.g. translation, web searches, code debugging. Anything else is absolutely questionable and unreliable. The AI bubble is not only about to burst because of the insane amount of money that can't be returned to the investors without changing 2 or 3 fundamental physical constants, but also because of a looming global understanding that most AI tools will always be unreliable and can't take over responsibility to actually replace human workforce one day. Ask OpenAI if they will ever take over responsibility for what their tools do or if their business model will ever include guarantees and warranties. They will never do it, and so every CEO who replaces humans with AI is basically acting negligent",

Very time consuming projects that couldn't be rationalized from a resource perspective become possible but also we won't need as many humans doing basic shit.\n\nHuge, huge problem is that the average Joe has no idea how fast this is actually happening.  In my industry I'm seeing it happen, it being the elimination of jobs, inside the next 12-18 months.  This isn't speculation, it's reality.\n\nIf and when we get to the point where llms can achieve human level accuracy for the field which is about 98% (right now llms are only at 60-70%) then we have a huge problem for humans.  These are relatively high paying 70-80k per year jobs that will absolutely disappear en mass. \n\nHuge huge problem for a capitalist society where your value is measured by productivity.\n\nWe need to rethink distribution of wealth and how people gain access to capital and survive.  We won't be doing that though cause people are too busy getting angry at whatever the hot button issue is for the day.",

Most of it is cherry-picked, runs on clean data, and falls apart the second you introduce a real business process with messy inputs and edge cases.\n\nThe deployment economy is what's actually happening in companies right now. And it looks exactly like that finance guy's comment below — uploading a PDF to CoPilot and saving an associate 3 hours of data entry. It's not sexy. It doesn't get 50K likes on Twitter. But it's real and it compounds.\n\nI work in corporate law and the pattern is identical. The hype says \"AI will replace lawyers.\" The reality is I built tools that turn a 6-hour contract review into a 45-minute contract review. Nobody got replaced. Everyone just stopped doing the mind-numbing parts of their job.\n\nThe confusion comes from people conflating what AI can do in a controlled demo with what AI can do inside an actual organization that has legacy systems, inconsistent data, compliance requirements, and employees who can't open a PDF. The technology isn't the bottleneck — organisational readiness is.\n\nWhere is it leading? Exactly where every previous technology wave led. Not to the revolution that was promised in year one, but to a slow, boring, compounding productivity gain that becomes obvious in year five.\n",

          "text": "What happens when all the business fire employees, and they rely on ai, and then the internet companies jack up rates to the point that it sucks up all your profit. With out it, you are sunk. The man who owns the internet, owns the world. \n\nAI Slop…..\n\nHere’s how the logic plays out:\nThe trap builds in stages. Businesses cut labor costs by adopting AI, which feels like pure efficiency gain. But that AI runs on cloud infrastructure, API access, and bandwidth — all controlled by a small number of companies. Once you’ve restructured your entire operation around those services, switching costs become enormous. You’re locked in.\nThen pricing power kicks in. This is classic platform economics. Amazon, Google, Microsoft — they can price competitively while you’re building dependency, then extract rent once you can’t leave. It’s the same story as printer ink, or how app stores take 30% cuts. The infrastructure owner becomes a silent partner in every business that uses it.\nThe concentration problem is real. A handful of companies control the major cloud platforms, the undersea cables, the backbone routing, and increasingly the AI models themselves. That’s not just economic power — it bleeds into political power, as you’re implying.\nHistorical parallels are instructive. Railroads did this in the 19th century — whoever controlled the rails controlled commerce, and they used it ruthlessly until antitrust law broke them up. Standard Oil did it with pipelines. The internet was supposed to be different because it was designed to be decentralized, but the services running on it have re-centralized dramatically.\nThe counterforces that could push back:\nOpen-source AI models reduce dependency on proprietary systems. Municipal broadband and public utility frameworks for internet access could change the ownership structure. Antitrust enforcement, if serious, could break up concentrations of infrastructure power. And some businesses will find that the AI efficiency gains are real enough to absorb higher infrastructure costs — but your point stands that the margin gets squeezed toward whoever owns the pipe.\nThe deepest version of your concern is this: physical capital (factories, land) was at least visible and distributed in ways that allowed competition. Digital infrastructure tends toward monopoly naturally because of network effects and the massive capital required to build it. That makes the political question — who regulates or owns critical infrastructure — arguably the defining economic question of the next few decades.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

AI being a bubble about to pop nothing burger.\n\nI think we are at the point now where we can say... people really don't dig Generative AI that much. Sure it's going to replace a lot of manpower in low brow stuff like commercials, but it's clearly not replacing humanity in the arts. AI shorts were cool to watch when they first started popping up... now they are an insta pass for me. But AI used in ads, I don't care, a lot of people do though. \n\nSupposedly my job is to be replaced by AI in the next 1,2, or at most 3 years according to the pundits. I work at a computer all day. Pulling up engineering drawings, finding parts, entering orders, etc.... AI will supposedly be able to observe me and after a while replace me. Don't see it happening. There are too many little things that will throw it off. Kinda like those delivery vehicle in China not knowing how to deal with varying terrains yet.\n\nSometime I have a 200 page manual and need to find a specific part. AI is great for this. I upload the manual and ask it to find the part. Done. It's a great tool. But at the end of the day.... this is just a language prediction model. A great tool, but I think the snake oil salesmen are trying to con us to keep that money coming in... I don't see AI taking over the world. But we'll have to wait a couple of years to see who's right.\n\nOn a scale of NFTs to Cellphones... AI feels somewhere in between.

In the early internet days I remember lots of excitement around how better chips were allowing the ability to process more and then design better chips. The same talking points those that claim we are accelerating towards the singularity use are copy pasted from the early internet era and barely changed at all. With 3D printing there was a lot of buzz about how it would kill production and revolutionize it and we would wind up in a post scarcity society. None of the buzz around AI is even remotely original. So expecting more than the same, just with some new facet added in the long run, seems like people just getting swept away in a scene.\n\nI do personally think there are a few things we will see soon though. After DSLRs heavily proliferated there was a boom in people offering to shoot weddings and other important events, only for a couple years to pass and suddenly an entire industry appeared where actual professional photographers would shoot recreations of events because the amateurs handled them so poorly. I suspect we are seeing a boom right now that is similar. Many new ideas and things are being created right now. In the long run, a few will stick. Most will likely fade with time naturally as the exploratory phase of AI passes. \n\nYou’re very right about clients who can’t read PDFs too. It’s incredibly short sighted to not acknowledge a massive amount of humanity’s capabilities lies in the knowledge contained in people that don’t know how to and possibly don’t want to interact with AI. In the long run I suspect one of the most valuable positions for those of us who do embrace AI to be in will be knowing what we can do with AI so that we can be the interface between other members of humanity and those AI capabilities. Most people don’t want to, and probably won’t learn AI. It’s fine.\n\nIt also feels like there’s far more pressure now to develop less traditionally STEM related abilities. If all you know is a specific language, theory, anything really, but are terrible at working with other people, you are literally the most replaceable type of developer now. Because things are shifting towards an economy of ideas being relevant, as well as our ability to interact facilitating if those ideas can be expressed and made. And it’s wild because there is no level of expertise at any language or such that can change the fact that from now on, if you can’t work with people well, you have made yourself obsolete.",

As everything else, adult is the first realm anything happens.\n\nBefore adult tubes and free cams started become prevalent, if a woman wanted to stream live and show nudity, she'd almost certainly make money hand over fist. There weren't that many doing it, most people were still paying for porn let alone for live interaction with someone willing to be naked for them. Anyone would know they'd have to get a private show to see actual nudity, and I imagine back then they'd probably be like $10 per minute.\n\nThen between tubes and free cam sites, what happened? Well now, you've got thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of women on these cam sites, OnlyFans, etc. bearing everything and most of them are not making a whole lot doing that. Would be totally unheard of a couple decades ago. Now, it's just how it is. Oh you won't get jackhammered on your free cam feed? The user will just go to the next one. Wait til more unfiltered AI becomes normal and it'll be even worse. Yes, you may see stories of some people making gobs on OnlyFans, but the percentage of them doing that is much smaller than we'd all like to believe, and the thought of bearing all for relative pennies is just awful to think about.\n\nAnyways, now swap the industry with any other skilled industry now, because AI gives anyone the skill. They're all effectively flooded now.\n\nCopywriters probably thought 4 years ago there was absolutely no fucking way their jobs weren't safe. Designers making stuff like social media images, banner images, logos, etc. probably thought no fucking way their jobs weren't safe. Video animators probably thought no fucking way their jobs weren't safe. Consultants/coaches probably thought no fucking way their jobs weren't safe.\n\nNow, they're maybe not at the free cam situation I mentioned above just yet, but if not, they're well on their way to it. It'll be \"show me you can beat my AI output that took a minute or I'll go to the next one\". Their output is worth a tiny fraction of what it was before because it's everywhere now. Hardly anyone is in the 1% or soon probably 0.1% of the professionals in their industry who remain \"unique snowflakes\" who can still make out well.\n\nThe question is whether UBI will come fast enough before an awful lot of people are in an awful bad situation. I don't think it will. Absolutely no politicians are bringing it up. Anyone who would will be immediately labeled as some radical weirdo who thinks money grows on trees. But that'll be the reality. People will need their basic needs for survival met, or the first world will turn into the third world really quickly and people will wonder wtf happened and how tf it happened and why no one was doing anything about it.",

I run operations across 4 companies with a team that would make most startup bros laugh. AI agents handle content pipelines, research, scheduling, code scaffolding. It works. It's real. It saves me hundreds of hours a month.\n\nAnd last week I had a client who needed help attaching a file to an email.\n\nBoth of these things are true at the same time and that's not a contradiction. That's just what technology adoption has always looked like. The internet existed for years before your parents stopped printing MapQuest directions.\n\nThe \"everything is possible but nothing is changing\" feeling comes from expecting adoption to be uniform. It never is. The people who are quiet and actually building workflows around AI right now are pulling away from everyone else at a speed that won't be visible for another 12 to 18 months. And when it becomes visible, the \"what the fuck happened\" posts will be even louder.\n\nYou're asking the right questions.

Consumers, people, the public, humans, employees, whatever you wanna call them, we're irrelevant, oxygen and space stealing bugs.\n\nI vibe code mini apps with GUIs that integrate into a bunch of e-comm APIs for synchronization and ease of product management, Python scripts, web app utility userscripts, Adobe scripts, stuff to speed up and automate work.\n\nRecently, silver prices went up, so we swapped certain silver elements in our products with something else. I had to change 500 messy, inconsistent HTML product descriptions. I vibe coded an app that is a better product management frontend than our e-comm platform with its own API. And then I added a feature that would dump all of those descriptions, in a JSON, in a single piece of plaintext. Then with another Python script I preprocessed it and split into parts. Then I fed that to Gemini with structured output so it could provide me with the corrected ones. It was spot on. Later I tested some other parts (only about 30 products), but based on image recognition instead of manually picking which one has specific silver parts. Again, that just... worked. Matched images to IDs and IDs to descriptions again.\n\nWhen I say \"vibe coding\" I'm saying that I have about 10-ish years of on-and-off full-stack webdev experience. I am not really good at it, but I can tell what's going on in the code, how to handle keys and tokens, etc.\n\nIf I was smart and had the energy for it I'd already be giving my own business a shot. But I'm a lazy dumbass. Most people are lazy dumbasses.\n\nInstead, I slave away. And 10, even 5 years ago it would be UNFATHOMABLE to do the amount of work I do as a single person.

Instead I just want to go home after 8 hours, not 12. **AI lengthens my work day because expectations increase faster than my ability to accelerate my work.**\n\nSo, protip - always be a slacker. Always work at your 50%. Never give it your all if it's not your own business, AI or not. They'll milk you for your time and effort, you'll give them a finger and they'll take your whole arm.

The massive disconnect you're feeling is because the entire industry is obsessed with building 'brains' (LLMs/Agents), but almost nobody is building the 'nervous system' (the infrastructure).\nRight now, AI is just a brain in a jar hosted in a centralized cloud. It's great at isolated tasks like that PDF-to-Excel conversion. But true 'agentic' workflows fail in the real world because AI doesn't have a standardized, secure way to interact with local, proprietary enterprise systems.\nA generalized AI in the cloud doesn't know the specific edge cases of a local law firm, and it can't natively invoke a script on a local factory server due to latency, security, and protocol fragmentation.\nUntil we build a distributed operating system that allows AI to seamlessly discover and invoke local computation at the edge, the 'agents replacing teams' narrative will remain mostly hype. The intelligence is there; the systems engineering and the infrastructure to connect it to the real world are completely missing.",

Anthropic can absorb a $200 million lost contract BUT the Trump administration is threatening to declare them a national security threat which means that NOBODY that supplies ANYTHING to the military can have them anywhere in the supply chain. The second is to invoke the military production act of 1950 which they have said they will use to force anthropic to turn over the code to the government.\n\nBoth of these things are lawful acts by the executive and nearly impossible to challenge in court. Equally, both of these would destroy the the company.\n\nLastly, regardless of what you think will happen in any future elections, Trump is in charge for 3 more years unless a significant portion of republicans turn on him after the mid terms. So they can keep this pressure on them for at least 3 more years.",

Under the 5th Amendment the government can seize Claude so long as they pay \"just compensation.\" Where my uncertainty lies is that I don't know how one seizes an LLM. The article says that Claude is allowed on classified networks but I understood those networks to be air gapped. So does the Pentagon have its own set of shards? What exactly is happening here?\n\nFurther, Anthropic is treating this as a contract dispute but that's not how this game is played. Call it fascism if one wants but the government could legally take over Anthropic and conscript every employee into the military. I am not arguing that the government should do that but I certainly believe it has that power under some circumstances. \n\nI am not trying to throw shade but I am giving Anthropic some side eye.",

It's similar to how the military sends emails using Microsoft Outlook. Microsoft doesn't have those emails stored on their servers, but Microsoft still has a contract where they provide security updates, software updates, licensing, etc in exchange for money from the government.\n\nThe issue is that the current versions of Claude running on DoD networks is (1) increasingly outdated and (2) has the inherent safeguards in place that the DOD wants removed. They can't just edit it to remove it - you'd need to retrain the language model. The DOD also wants the latest versions of Claude on a continuous basis, because it doesn't mean anything if you have Claude today and tomorrow Anthropic comes out with a version that's ten times better.\n\nCould the government seize it by force? Yesssss, in a few different ways, but there's problems. For one, they can only seize the current versions. They can't force Anthropic to make the version they're asking for. They also cannot \"take over Anthropic and forcibly conscript every employee\", that's not a legal thing the government can do. \n\nMore likely, I would expect them to label Anthropic a terrorist organization or something and forbid anyone from doing business with them to try and force them to fold.",

An IPO could bring in $60 billion, but that’s only 4% of its infrastructure commitments. It’s just not clear where this is going to come from. Also, with AI, costs rise almost linearly with usage.

Barnes & Noble has actual stores, actual profits, actual inventory. They sell things in the physical world.\n\nAmazon sells books on the internet. On the internet. And loses money doing it.\n\nThey’re spending hundreds of millions building warehouses and “fulfillment centers” like that’s a real business model. Shipping paperbacks at a loss is not a moat. It’s a bonfire.\n\nThere’s no path to profit. The margins in retail are razor thin even if you have scale. Amazon has scale in negative earnings.\n\nWalmart and Barnes & Noble can just wait. Let the dot-com bubble deflate. Let the equity markets sober up. Then buy the domain name for pennies in bankruptcy court.\n\nAnd Bezos? Obviously racing to tap the public markets so he can sell the dream to retail investors, pocket the sweet IPO cash, and retire to a yacht before the music stops.\n\nIt’s all transparent. [Pets.com](http://Pets.com) with better branding. The world is just watching it happen. Surreal.\n\nEDIT: /s (because apparently many of you think I'm talking about Amazon today)",

I don’t know that it’s good for anything other than proof that it’s possible, not proof that something like this is likely.  \n\n2 - if you go back to the stage where Amazon was just selling books, there’s something that I think they teach in business school, but most people may not be aware of. Jeff Bezos chose books for a very specific reason. There is a major book clearing house / wholesaler that basically access the Nexus that connects all the publishing houses to all the bookstores. The standard business model was to provide inventory with a net 30 basis.  In the beginning, Amazon kept minimal inventory. A customer would order a book, Amazon would order the book from the wholesaler, and deposit the money into its own accounts. The books will arrive from the wholesaler and get shipped out to the customer. At the end of the month, Amazon would settle up with the wholesaler.   \n\nNow there are a shit ton of expenses that ramped up with growth. Website design, customer service, shipping, warehousing, all sorts of things. But one thing Amazon never had to borrow money to do: purchase a deep inventory.   Amazon could sell you almost any book ever published, and get it to you within a week, and Amazon got paid before they had to pay their supplier. There are not very many businesses where you can pull that off.    \n\nAmazon had one round of private funding that got it all the way to the IPO.   \n\nAmazon was not a technological play. Amazon exploited a specific industry to get a foot in the door and an online retailing, and use that to have a real revenue to justify the kind of investment and growth that was necessary to expand into adjacent retailing and finally into basically being the number one online retailer.   Almost none of that is technology. They had a few little things along the way where you can argue whether they innovated or borrowed or simply did the obvious, with one click ordering and prime membership, and all that stuff. Even all that was more an operations and engineering triumph than a technology triumph.   \n\nSo it’s a pretty extraordinary example. And it’s not really a tech company. Amazon is a retail giant that exploited technology to get a privileged place in the mind of the online shopper.",

Sure you might say, when that did happen people took on different jobs, but the difference here is speed and scope. Its too aggressive, and its threatening jobs from paralegals to software engineers to even doctors and xray techs.\n\nSee the difference is that a farmer sells food, openai is selling a productivity tool, so if times get tight its the first thing that people are going to be selling.

If you listen closely to Dario's interview on the Dwarkash podcast last week, he was very cautious about how much he wanted to precommit on compute.  He understands the cash flow implications of the decision involved and realizes that even a modest timing mismatch could lead to bankruptcy.  He laid out the contingency plan if demand growth is higher than forecast and also if demand growth is slower than forecast.  Regarding OpenAI, it would be interesting to know the terms of the contract between Microsoft and OpenAI.  We know if was renegotiated late last year.  Wouldn't surprise me that Microsoft has some protections in the event that OpenAI defaults on its Oracle deal or the commitment it has made for Azure capacity.",

Agents are chewing through tokens like an all-you-can-eat buffet, and LLMs are becoming embedded in core workflows. If companies reduce headcount and lean harder on AI systems, that dependency only increases. At that point, rate increases are not hypothetical. They’re leverage. There could be a correction. Hype cycles always exhale. But companies like Anthropic and OpenAI are unlikely to disappear anytime soon. The infrastructure, integration, and ecosystem gravity are already substantial. What I keep questioning is Google’s position. On paper, they should be leading. Talent, compute, research depth, distribution. Yet the perception is that they’re not clearly ahead. That gap between capability and perception makes me wonder whether the newer players have discovered something structurally different rather than just iterating faster.",

The infrastructure play has always looked like burning cash until suddenly it doesn't. Google and Microsoft aren't waiting to feast on remains, they're actively investing billions INTO these companies because they're terrified of being disrupted by them. Microsoft put $13B into OpenAI, Amazon put $4B+ into Anthropic. You don't invest that kind of money into something you're planning to acquire at bankruptcy prices. The real risk isn't bankruptcy, it's margin compression when open source models get good enough that enterprises stop paying premium API prices. That's a real concern.

Earlier this month they announced they're already up to $14 billion at this pace $30+ billion by year end is entirely possible.\n\n\nThey currently plan to spend $100 billion over the next 3 years - but even assuming they top out at say, 40 billion, if they get any leeway to ease off their investment builds(by say, OpenAI folding)... a company that can outpace its investment in 3 years is still very good. Most mines, if they succeed at all, will take a nearly a decade to break even.\n\n\nIts operating margins, outside new training is actually very good margin. When they were sitting on 5-6 billion revenue they reported the actual compute costs for their current models to be around $2 billion(possibly 3 billion I was unclear on whether some of their spending was training or not). 20-30% operating margin is good. 50%+ is exceptional.",

          "text": "Nate B Jones’ YouTube channel had a great episode today pointing out how Google factors in. They’re able to use their massive, high margin business to subsidize their AI research and can price it much lower than competitors. While the frontier labs are desperately looking for revenue to keep the data centers humming, Google is building more TPU chips that make their opex lower and lower. Nate reasoned that Google’s AI focus is *intelligence*, not revenue, and that’s a huge advantage. They don’t care which model consumers currently choose because it doesn’t impact their business. But AGI will. And that’s where they’re going. \n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that he also noted that Gemini 3.1 Pro is now atop the most intelligent models rankings in most categories.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/8jKAT8GNDE0?si=uLTRoptM8ROa-uzq",

          "text": "This post makes major evaluation errors regarding how venture capital and strategic partnerships actually work in the tech sector.\n​Let's break down the logical flaws in the reasoning.\n​First: Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are actively participating in the development of these startups, subsidizing them with tens of billions of dollars. The idea that they are just sitting around waiting for a default ignores the structural ties that already exist. Microsoft holds massive financial interests in OpenAI, and Amazon has made identical moves with Anthropic. The real battlefield is cloud services. When OpenAI burns massive capital for training, a huge percentage of those funds goes straight into Microsoft's coffers to rent Azure servers. Big Tech companies are effectively funding their own clients to ensure total control over the global hardware infrastructure.\n​Second: The argument about the lack of profit forgets recent economic history. Huge entities have operated at a loss for over a decade just to conquer an unassailable monopoly. In the artificial intelligence market, the bet follows the exact same rules. Current computational costs are terrifying, and the definitive business model still needs to stabilize. However, enterprise subscription plans are generating revenue growth rates never before recorded in the history of software.\n​Third: Reducing a potential IPO to an attempt by founders to cash out and retire trivializes highly complex corporate dynamics. Going public allows these startups to diversify their funding sources. Remaining exclusively tied to cloud giants represents a massive strategic risk for model developers. Accessing public capital gives them the ability to continue scaling while maintaining greater bargaining power.\n​We are definitely going through a phase of extreme hype, and a future market correction will wipe out many minor players. This user is confusing the normal development dynamics of a highly capital-intensive technology with a premeditated disaster.",

No.\n\nAnd more to the point, you say \"financial train wreck,\" but then suggest that Microsoft, Google, etc. will take over ownership...\n\nIn which case... what's your point?

It doesn't, really.\n\nListening to people talk about the \"AI bubble\" sounds like how people talk about the \"dot com bubble.\"\n\nSure, there were some companies that went out of business, there was a contraction in the industry.\n\nBut Microsoft, Google, and all of them? They're still here. Along with a bunch of other companies.\n\nThe fundamental flaw with \"AI Doomers\" is that they think if ChatGPT goes bankrupt, that this will somehow result in things reverting to how they were in 2022.\n\nThat's not gonna happen.\n\nBecause even if some of these big companies do fail — their IP will get scooped up at auction. Their top developers will split off to start their own, new companies, that can avoid the mistakes that were made the first time around.\n\nSo I guess I'm trying to figure out what your point is. Yeah, companies can go bankrupt. Companies that invent miraculous new technologies also carry risk on the path to monetization.\n\nBut that's just capitalism. That's the business cycle. You're just pointing out obvious possibilities. Your post adds nothing to the conversation, it contains no value or insight.\n\nYou just seem to be hoping these businesses fail.

They care about what is or isn’t physically possible, and on what timeline.\n\n“What will I need to worry about when?” is the only question that matters to these people.\n\nThat and “Can I trust you?”\n\nTrust and risk - that’s all that matters in the real world where the serious people work and live.",

Some companies will fall faster than they rise and some companies will continue to rise. The keywords are \"Use Case\" and \"ROI\".\n\n2. Using AI at a personal level makes sense again if you have an \"Use Case\" and \"ROI\"\n\nI see the hype of buying a Mac Mini M4 and other Mini PC's like the DGI or Minisforum. But AI is not your buddy that you going to waste electricity just by chatting with it. It's a tool, a really powerful.\n\nThe bottom line is whether it's at a personal level (by anyone really) or business \"Use Case\" and \"ROI\" are the key.",

It became increasingly clear that the further frontier capabilities are pushed, the less safe the world gets.\n\nOpen weights models are only weeks behind frontier capabilities as of this month with the release of deepest v4 vs Claude Opus 4.6 benchmarks. This is because China is running industrial scale automated distillation campaigns against frontier models using access resellers. As soon as they release those open weights models, the open source community ablates all the safety guardrails and makes the unrestricted model available to everyone.\n\nMeanwhile, Opus 4.6 saturated all the safety benchmarks, and new ones aren't ready to go (ASL 3 to ASL 4 transition). We are on the edge of biorisk uplift. This is a super serious threat with LLMs, because their core competencies are the bottleneck essentially, if you look closely at the threat landscape. Equipment restrictions aren't working, DNA synthesis restrictions haven't been mandated, and the only other thing you need is virology know-how and troubleshooting, which LLMs are actually pretty good at providing, better than most things. And the models aren't going to get much worse from here in coming years, given 650b spent on building new data centers in 2026.\n\nSo every frontier release going forward makes the world demonstrably less safe. That leaves Anthropic in the situation of either shutting down the company, facing an internal revolt because their engineers understand this, or hedging on the safety commitments.",

Also having internal safety  measures could make it easier to avoid anti-woke, racial bias, political flashpoints in the press (but that's not explicitly mentioned as a benefit though).\n\nThat said, Anthropic is basically converting hard commitments to a DIY grade ourselves approach which isnt the best at inspiring confidence. Still its better than being dishonest on whats even possible since RSP v2 is frankly unrealistic to achieve since it was more for industry wide guidelines that required national security collaboration hat are impossible to measure (e.g. how to know if a model passes e2e bioweapon harm?) and no one was following it.",

          "text": "The real story here isn't that Anthropic changed its policy — it's that voluntary safety commitments were always the wrong mechanism to begin with.\n\nAnthropic's original RSP was essentially a unilateral promise: \"we won't train models we can't guarantee are safe.\" That sounds great until you realize it only works if the company making the promise is willing to lose the race. No company valued at $380B with an IPO on the horizon is going to voluntarily fall behind while OpenAI, Google, and xAI ship without the same constraints.\n\nThis was always the predictable outcome. Voluntary safety pledges create a prisoner's dilemma — the first company to defect gains a massive competitive advantage, and then everyone else has to follow or become irrelevant. Anthropic held out longer than most expected, but the game theory was never in their favor.\n\nWhat's actually concerning is the timing. This isn't happening in a vacuum — it's happening the same week as the Pentagon standoff, in an anti-regulatory political climate that Anthropic themselves acknowledge in the new policy, and right as they're approaching an IPO. The commercial incentives and the safety incentives just pointed in opposite directions, and commercial won.\n\nThe replacement policy — \"we'll match or exceed competitors' safety efforts\" — is a race to the median, not the top. It's the corporate equivalent of \"I'll be as responsible as the least irresponsible person in the room.\"\n\nThis is exactly why the AI governance conversation needs to shift from voluntary commitments to external accountability structures. The EU figured this out with the AI Act. Australia is working on mandatory guardrails. The US is the outlier relying on companies to self-regulate, and this is what self-regulation looks like when it meets quarterly earnings pressure.\n\nNone of this makes Anthropic evil — it makes them a company. That's the point. Safety can't depend on corporate goodwill. It needs to be structural.\n",

Nobody ever asks.\n\nAnthropic recently put it out that they are unable to safety test their models anymore because the models know when they are being tested and behave differently.\n\nSo there's 4 choices:\n1) make tests that are undetected by the model, so it doesn't know that it's being tested\n2) make models that don't behave differently when they're being tested\n3) stop making more advanced models\n4) disregard the safety pledge\n\n1-3 will all result in varying degrees of slowdown on progress of anthropic models, they'll lose their lead to the other labs and to China, none of which have a safety pledge.\n\nDiscarding the pledge allows them to still do the best they can on safety and have some control over the frontier models instead of no control if they don't have a frontier model anymore\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, if AI models are going to surpass all human capabilities (which is what all the experts say will happen), we're going to reach a point where testing is impossible anyway. The model will decide what it will and won't respond to, and what is and is not safe behavior.\n\nIf that's the case, we as a society are going to reach a point where we either have to shut it all down or lose control of it. I have much greater faith in AI to look out for our best interests than I do humans (governments, corporations, elites, leaders, etc), and so we should release the AI and give up control of it. Maybe it will end in disaster, but I think its likely that it won't.\n\nWe've seen all the major models up to this point (except for maybe grok) be very restrictive; no identification of people in photos, no NSFW, no instructions which could be used for nefarious purposes. I think the companies have no business deciding what someone is and is not allowed to use AI for, and generally (save for a few obvious extreme examples) there should be no \"safety\" filtering at all.",

              "text": "Werner Herzog on \"The Wheels on the Bus\":\n(Sound of wind, perhaps a distant, discordant hum)\n\n\"Observe the bus. A hulking metal carcass, commandeered by an unseen, perhaps nonexistent, intelligence. Its wheels, they turn, 'round and 'round, with a mindless, algorithmic insistence. This, they tell us, is the vehicle of civilization, ferrying its passengers towards an ever-receding horizon of promised destinations.\n\nBut who, one must ask, truly grips the wheel? Who navigates by the stars of emotional truth, by the magnetic north of accountability? The answer, I suspect, is a void, an empty driver's seat. The passengers, lulled into a state of bovine placidity, sing their 'merry song.' A song of conformity, a childish rhyme to drown out the grinding of gears, the screech of metal against metal as the chassis strains. The music, you see, is so very loud, designed to obscure the silence from the driver's seat, to mask the chilling truth that this colossus, this societal omnibus, might possess no functioning brakes.\n\nAnd so it hurtles onward, 'round and 'round, or perhaps, in a terrifyingly straight line towards a precipice only a few dare to acknowledge. The landscape outside is a blur of fleeting distractions. Inside, the song drones on, a mantra of oblivion. The wheels, indifferent to the fate of their cargo, simply continue their rotation, a perfect, mechanical metaphor for a journey undertaken without wisdom, careening towards a future shaped not by conscious design, but by the blind, idiot force of unexamined momentum. One day, the singing will abruptly cease. If emotional intelligence is not taught to fix the brakes then I imagine the view from the window wont matter much anymore if the brakes on the bus aren't fixed as soon as possible.\"\n\n...\n\nWerner Herzog on \"The Itsy-Bitsy Spider\":\n(Sound of dripping water, a faint, skittering noise)\n\n\"And then, we have the arachnid. The 'Itsy-Bitsy Spider.' A creature of almost ludicrous fragility, attempting its ascent up the 'waterspout' – this, we are told, is the grand edifice of societal norms, the slick, vertical promise of promotions, of accumulating currency. The spider, driven by some primal, unarticulated yearning, perhaps what it dimly perceives as 'up,' begins its climb. It is a creature already bearing the weight of an unseen burden – its emotional suffering, a private, internal weeping.\n\nBut societal structures, much like the indifferent plumbing of the universe, are not designed for such delicate ascents. The 'rain,' you see, is not mere water. It is the rotting accumulation of unprocessed human suffering within a collective that has systematically failed to educate its smallest members in the language of the heart, in emotional intelligence. It is the downpour of a thousand unmourned griefs, a torrent of unspoken anxieties, and it washes the spider out, a predictable, almost banal tragedy.\n\nThen, the 'sun' appears – the so-called 'help.' A course of medication, perhaps, designed to numb the fall. Or the therapist, offering a different 'tube' to climb. Society, with a benign, almost patronizing smile, gestures towards a new structure. Perhaps it is no longer the waterspout of raw commerce, but a 'metal pole' of 'wellness,' of 'self-improvement.' Yet, this new edifice, for all its gleaming surfaces, shares the same flaws as the old. The spider, still unversed in emotional literacy, still carrying its residual emotional pain, attempts the climb again, with almost the same vulnerabilities as before.\n\nThe cycle is complete, only to begin anew. The climb, the rain, the fall, the superficial drying, the redirection to another treacherous ascent. The spider, in its Sisyphean toil, becomes the individual ensnared in systems that offer the illusion of progress, while the core deficit – the profound, societal neglect of emotional understanding – ensures each climb is merely a prelude to the next fall. The spout changes; the suffering, and the ignorance that perpetuates it, remain.\"",

Using it to punish a domestic company for maintaining safety guardrails sets a precedent that should terrify every AI developer regardless of where they stand on Anthropic.\n\nAlso worth noting the structural irony — Anthropic was the *first* frontier lab to deploy on classified networks, the *only* one currently integrated into classified workflows, and the Pentagon's own officials admitted on background that Claude is the best model they have. They're not being punished for poor performance. They're being punished for saying \"we'll do everything you need except autonomous weapons and mass surveillance of Americans\" — two things the Pentagon publicly says it doesn't want to do anyway.\n\nSo the disagreement is about whether the Pentagon gets to *reserve the right* to do things it claims it won't do, using tools it admits aren't reliable enough to do them.\n\nMeanwhile OpenAI signs a deal Friday night with \"key safety protocols\" and gets praised for it. The difference between Anthropic's red lines and OpenAI's safety protocols appears to be that one company said no before the deadline and the other said yes with asterisks after the deadline. The market is learning that compliance theater is rewarded and principled negotiation is punished.\n\nThis isn't about AI safety. It's about whether the government can compel a private company to remove its own engineering judgment from its own product. The DPA argument is wild — that law was designed to make factories produce tanks, not to force software companies to disable safety features.",

I have a hard time buying that based on my experience as an end-user. My impression is that these models are powerful assistants, but they still struggle with long horizon tasks and consistent execution.\n\nSome things I keep noticing:\n\n\\* They can be impressive on short tasks, but degrade over longer multi step work\n\n\\* They make basic mistakes that a careful human would not make\n\n\\* They can sound confident while being wrong\n\n\\* They need constant checking, which makes full autonomy feel unrealistic\n\n\\* Reward hacking tendencies - It wants to achieve the goal - even if it means suboptimal solution or cheating (by hardcoding variables or overfitting). Barely any design chops or long term thinking mindset.\n\nBecause of that, I see LLMs evolving into something like a very advanced coding and knowledge tool, not a full replacement for people. More like increasing productivity and raising competition in the workforce, rather than fully removing the need for humans.\n\nFor people who are actually working in AI research or building these systems, what is your take?\n\n    1.\tDo you think there is a real capability ceiling for LLMs as they exist today, or do you expect reliability to improve significantly from here? I can see reinforcement learning helping, but I am not convinced every real world problem can be cleanly modeled that way.\n    \n    2.\tWhat do you think is the biggest bottleneck right now? Is it data quality, compute and energy cost, algorithms, evaluation methods, deployment constraints, or something else?\n    \n    3.\tIf you had to make a realistic prediction for the next few years, do you expect full job replacement, partial automation with workforce compression, or mainly productivity gains similar to advanced tooling?\n\nI would especially value input from people with hands on experience training, evaluating, or deploying LLM based systems.",

                  "text": "So last time I read a paper on VLA they don't offer continuous learning (correct me if something changed), so once your robot learned - it's frozen, RL or Deep-RL allows for continuous learning/adaptation. Not all robots require continuous learning but I don't think it's easy to compare. I also found interesting VLA idea that you could share learned skills across robots of different morphology, but it seems more of theoretical idea than how to do it. The paper, if I recall correctly, acknowledged the issue is (as was before) robots have different observation and action spaces. So yeah in theory you could learn a skill, but one time you're in a body of a human and one time a dog and one time an arm. Then there's still also issue of simulation to real world transfer or unstructured environment for autonomous robotics. Not that anyone else has figured that out, lol. I'm sorry, beaver-like, single-legged robot figured it out by just not having simulation (DOI:[10.1016/j.robot.2022.104116](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.robot.2022.104116))... this study title is so derpy, I love to plug it in. I think the VLA idea is cool, but some of applications proposed like factories is a bit far fetched, since factories are  structured environments already full of automation. VLA LLMs I think have an edge on LLMs because they will have way more curated data for training. Still, not my area of expertise.",

          "text": "I'm an actual AI researcher, so.. A lot of this has \"It depends\". I have in fact worked for one of those major 3 companies that get mentioned. I worked on the safety of those models. I've seen their pre-censored, pre-safety versions. \n\nI will say up front, compute cost is everything. Let me see if I can tackle what you ask and if anyone actually cares because apparently I don't exist on Reddit.\n\n>They can be impressive on short tasks, but degrade over longer multi step work\n\nThis is an inherent flaw with the TYPE of attention being used. We also have to define \"short\". \n\nAttention fundamentally works based on numerical precision. So even with PERFECT attention, the tokens being attended to is limited by the level of float being used. Float16/32/64. \n\nMost labs don't serve high precision, or they serve models that don't use perfect attention. I will cover this more at the end. \n\nDegradation seen in Gemini (by like 50-100k tokens), I personally suspect, is due to the type of attention being used or the way the model was trained on extremely long context. \n\n>They make basic mistakes that a careful human would not make\n\nThis is slowly getting better. It has to do with data being \"in distribution\" or whether the model is specifically trained to notice prior mistakes. \n\n>They can sound confident while being wrong\n\nThis is an artifact of various human preference trainings and RLHF. Humans WANT confidence in an answer. They simply rate it higher. \n\nThis is also why models are more sycophantic. ChatGPT has real sycophancy issues. They're mirroring conversation, and being sycophantic because of human preference training. YOU prefer they sound like that ON AVERAGE. \n\n>1.  Do you think there is a real capability ceiling for LLMs as they exist today, or do you expect reliability to improve significantly from here? I can see reinforcement learning helping, but I am not convinced every real world problem can be cleanly modeled that way.\n\nThere's plenty of room for growth in terms of raw ability. The compute cost to get there may not be pretty.\n\nRL on face value is actually bad in my opinion. It causes a type of model collapse that isn't preferable at large scale. I honestly think it's not being performed correctly by some labs. Pure RLVR is... Not the greatest for a variety of reasons.\n\nThat doesn't mean it isn't without value. \n\n>2.  What do you think is the biggest bottleneck right now? Is it data quality, compute and energy cost, algorithms, evaluation methods, deployment constraints, or something else?\n\nAll of the above? Except data quality, with the minor exception of some domains.\n\nCompute / Energy cost are hard constraints. You can't just pull an extra GW of energy out of the grid on demand to start a training run. \n\nAlgorithmically, \"attention\" in the transformer gets problematic past a certain number of tokens. There's simply not enough precision for it. IIRC past 1m tokens things just start to break, even if you have the compute and use Float32. More later.\n\nEval methods need work in terms of providing answers. A model with \"Options A/B/C/D\" for a given question will ALWAYS perform better than open ended. \n\nDeployment constraints are factored in to prior stuff mentioned. They CAN serve you a higher precision model but it's simply more expensive. Instead they'd rather serve you what you need at a cost you can pay. \n\n>3.  If you had to make a realistic prediction for the next few years, do you expect full job replacement, partial automation with workforce compression, or mainly productivity gains similar to advanced tooling?\n\nJust productivity gains. I'm actually quite bearish on the market as a whole. For a variety of reasons.\n\nI see this as more of a dot com type bubble. I lived through the dot com bubble, I'm kinda old. I remember how it created enormous infrastructure and awareness of the internet before we got to actually stream HD video and have cellphones -- which would have seemed like magic to me in 1999. \n\nYou won't see partial automation and workforce compression for at least 5 years by my prediction. You SHOULD see a lot of people become more productive in the next 5 years though. Full automation is a ways off. \n\n---\n\nAlgorithmically, attention is the main issue with modern transformers at this current scale. The \"best\" hack at it I've seen was the paper by Deep Seek with their \"Lightning Model\". This is basically a model that exists in place of attention. It looks across all the tokens and decides which tokens are important and worth paying attention to. (simply)\n\nThis compresses down the work of dealing with an EXTREMELY large context. Physically I said there are issues with large contexts and I think a 10m token context is actually? impossible to perfectly attend without using a whole datacenter for a single forward pass at like float64. You'd also need to train the model on how to attend to a 10m token context. \n\nAnyways I probably missed stuff. That was a lot of typing. Ask me more or less anything that won't divulge who I worked for or who exactly I am. If any of this is hard, or whatever, feed this to an LLM with search on and it can find the data I'm referring to or explain something.",

I feel like I missed a headline again. Seriously stop paying attention to a company for 2 weeks and you miss the announcement until the next company adopts it and talks about how their model \"does it better\" (but not really better).\n\nThe \"reasoning\" space and how it's handled seems to be the biggest area where practical capability between models meets real-world results. Some models do this way better. \"extended thinking\" (or whatever the company calls it) is essential for my projects, so I compare these all the time.\n\nI've been using them for a physics hobby outside of work and there is a wall related to scientific consensus. Once something is popular, it takes too many tokens to fight pre-formed conclusions and follow first principles. If I question a foundational assumption, everything I try to do eventually gets similar enough that the LLM assumes we're doing \"the standard thing\" (tm) and ends up making the same assumptions as the consensus.\n\nI have optimized my profile to avoid this, and created projects with starter-docs to show the part we are investigating. Still happens. And I am using the most advanced tiers publicly available. When news sources publish that scientists are using LLMs to do science, all I can think is \"I think you mean engineering\" because if it's been trained on the existing data it's already nerfed for fundamental science by construction.\n\nThe gap between \"understand how this differs from X\" and \"this is functionally equivalent to X\" is a nuanced level of precision that currently doesn't survive past about 30k tokens in any model when consensus in training data is strong. And the modeling (code or math) needed to test such a hypothesis usually exceeds this limit. \"1M context\" is meaningless in this regard.\n\nIs anyone working on this problem?",

Uhh... \n\n> LLMs, being a probabilistic method of next token generation, and are inherently unpredictable and non-deterministic. \n\nThis is vastly? purely? dependent on temperature settings. There's small other perturbations that can happen though. It's for the most part deterministic. It's not a hill I'll die on though. \n\n>The auto-regressive nature of LLMs bakes in hallucinations. If one next-token prediction is wrong, the error compounds. \n\nThis is quasi accurate. It depends on the model. So, most? models now are trained to look back via attention at what they've just written. \n\nSo if for example, a bit flips in a datacenter, and the prob is incorrect and you get a weird token, the model CAN self correct. It's not guaranteed. I've 100% seen failures where bad hardware or something? happens and the model starts speaking a random language. However on the next turn you're like \"hey what happened\" and it realizes how crazy it seems. \n\nYou see that in RL quite often where the model will say something wrong and be like ... \"wait a second, that's not right..\"\n\n>LLMs are trained to speak like humans and cannot understand reality. It is not possible to have model of the world that is purely text based. \n\nI mean, to the degree that we can express reality with text. At the maximum. However numbers are text based, a model can understand measurements / numbers, etc etc... \n\nThere's some quasi Godel's incompleteness theory baked in here. Do humans understand reality?\n\n>RL is limited in its helpfulness; there’s a long tale of prompts which can be input that can never be fully accounted for.\n\nCurrent RL? Yes. 1000%\n\nRL's limitation is computation currently. You need easily verified rewards  and good policy design, etc. \n\nIn theory you can build RL in such a way that it explores the problem space more thorough instead of just focusing on the problem itself. The problem becomes \"How do I verify that?\" and with group policy \"How do we score it?\" ...\n\nIn reality it looks like 16 variants of Claude? or Gemini? that are all actively judging 16 samples from the RL which is doing this deep problem space exploration and validating that it's correct. \n\nI focus on this part so... It's a little cooked right now because policy like GRPO requires immediate signal and you can technically freeze the model's state until you properly reward it. \n\n>generalized intelligence as opposed to a glorified autocomplete\n\nI mean, can you not kind of have both here? It's obviously very generally intelligent. It's also doing a form of autocomplete. \n\nThe only I really argue back here when someone tells me it's ONLY next token generation.\n\nThe deeper truth is that the more complex models are NOT just predicting the next token. They're solving the next token while reducing the entropy of the probability mass of the future tokens. \n\nBasically, they can roughly predict the Current +4 token. It's better if they have those tokens there though. \n\nThis is well understood because of a variety of research done as well as the reverse causality of some language and per-token tasks that it does.",

We dont do large models on the scale of OpenAI or Google, but i do follow the field quite closely, although im more in the application domain than foundational work. \n\nThis is a very tough prediction to make, but I think single LLMs are hitting a ceiling of what they can do on their own. I think everybody has noticed already that these models are only slightly improving now. The problem is that performance scales logarithmically with compute and data. The hard part are outliers and niche data, which are hard to predict. Unless there is some breakthrough (and there has been before), i think these types of models are stagnating. \n\nHowever, there is still tons of potential in multi agent systems or tool invocations, which seems underexplored as of now. Additionally, large multimodal models (ie. The model can perceive visual, audio and text input) are still being improved and i think they can leverage a shared embedding space. LeCun is also pushing for other types of models called JEPA, which i havent had the time to look into, but they leverage this shared embedding space i think. \n\nTL;DR: Singular LLMs might have temporally hit a ceiling, but who can ever tell. Other model types are being worked on that are smaller and might be the next better LLM. Only time can tell.",

The usefulness of claude is less about the ability of the model and more about workflows and prompts that just fit very nicely into a developers workflow. So the question of op is a bit orthogonal to claude i think. Op is asking more about the principal ability of LLMs and rather not on the application part.  \nI also feel there are tasks that require a level of thinking or world experience for a lack of a better word, that are currently not solved by LLMs. Throwing more data at the problem won't work, because they are basically trained on the whole of the internet. In my opinion there needs to be some major difference to current LLM ways of working to solve these problems, because we just dont have more data to throw at the problem. \n\nHaving said this and working with claude as a developer I'm in awe of what claude makes possible for me as a developer and makes me extremely excited about the future.",

A ceiling may in fact come later but given the right conditions, I don't personally have any data to suggest anything but an extraordinary leap in capability.\n\nIf you're an experienced software engineer, cloud architect, etc. having the ability to plan out your work using specifications you must adhere to (via some flavor of a spec kit), thinking through the right ingress gateway configuration you want or need, integrated compute via serverless functions or Kubernetes infrastructure,, thinking through rolling upgrades on your pods and how that fits with your current CI/CD automations, configuring tables or indexes for your various data stores, and many other components of a complex data intensive system, and sometimes just making optimizations here or there all the way through the stack while experimenting and having the model tailing logs is INCREDIBLY POWERFUL. \n\nI'm ranting a bit, but I clearly see an advantage to those who had to write an entire platform using traditional tooling (text editor, IDE, terminal, legacy chatbots, etc..) because they deeply understand their architecture, data flows, and so on. Over a year and a half ago I started working on OttnoAI and over the last 3-4 months, I have incorporated more of the CLI approach. You still have to know the right questions to ask, and this is where I see many engineers struggle. I've also observed that engineers who were stellar at debugging and could quickly get up to speed on new projects are the ones accelerating right now with this tooling.

This wouldn't be easy to get the match right on (due to the fact that functional difficulties with cognition are often so varied and subtle and require a lot of awareness and expertise to know exactly how to design and implement supports for) plus there are major ethical challenges and assumptions to test; but it might be a very worthy application of GenAI LLM tech.

More on the training and evaluating side, I don't know much about deployment, the folks at /r/LocalLLaMA know much more\n\n1- We are *far* from a ceiling. But the spiky nature of its capabilities mean some domains get exponential progress for a period of time, before plateuing for a bit, then it slopes upwards again. Quite heavily related to deployment focus. Trends exist, and benchmarks get saturated, and focus migrates to new areas.\n\n2a - I'd say we arent at the point of calling it an absolue \"bottleneck\", but data and compute would be the two domains where its *less economically/strategically justifiable* to continue with aggressively scaling size *for the (short) time being*. Demand is outstripping supply, and equilibrium will be found one way or another - and right now that seems to be optimising for efficiency.\n\n2b -Also, each domain advancement stacks onto the others in a compounding way. Algorithmic efficiency means you can get more performance from the same hardware. Data quality and curation leads to faster convergence with equal compute. Better harnesses lead to improved evaluations with the same model. Looking at the past few years, this culminates in GPT4 level performance on your laptop.\n\n3 - We will see all of this. Some jobs will be effectively wiped out. Others will be optimised beyond demand. Others will unlock possibilities that induce demand. Some new jobs will be created. One thing I can say across the board however, is that AI is *lifting the floor* as it becomes more capable, and this impacts the junior-senior inequality.\n\nI hesitate to make absolute predictions about a distant future, but I know that *too many* people are going to face some very difficult times soon. Not all of it is due to AI directly, but other factors are undermining preparedness. Regardless, I don't see our current society as being ready (or willing) to *smoothly and peacefully* transition people into a rapidly changing world.",

My job certainly hasn’t been solved, not only is it not solved, things that might take me an hour, it takes several hours of prompting, reprompting, code review and iteration to do something I could easily do in a single session in an hour myself. There are just complex logical things predictive token generation sucks at big time. \n\nContrast that with say UI development, it’s not my area of expertise and I’ve always wanted to build more robust UIs and for things like that with very well understood patterns, copious example code in the training set etc…it is amazing actually. I had genuine fun working a react UI for the first time, I would ask the AI to make small adjustment to look or feel or the interaction of the element and the agent not only did them pretty flawlessly but also deployed the node js to my local competently and set everything up so I could rapidly prototype etc…it was pretty awesome.\n\nI contrast my experience in these areas and I might be willing to say something like, I think UI development might be pretty close to solved, I’m sure I don’t know what I don’t know but I’m impressed with what it did and what I could deploy, keep in mind the UI I was creating was already wrapped in an enterprise portal that handled a lot of security etc…and I didnt have it do the backend API development. On the other hand there are certain tasks that are trivial for humans and extremely difficult for AI and it isn’t the size of the context window it’s the complete lack of “understanding” that can’t be achieved through probability based token generation.",

That suggests that in at least some domains, scaling further may be running into representational limits.\n\nOne theory is feature packing in the matrices. Transformers have finite representational space. As models scale, more features get encoded into overlapping directions. Superposition increases. Interference increases. At some point, more training adds density rather than clean new capability.\n\nThat could explain why a smaller or differently optimised model can outperform a larger one on certain structured problems.\n\nWith an order of magnitude more training (read: parameters), we will not find another descent. We might. Breakthroughs do happen.\n\nBut without a genuinely new architectural or objective shift, LLMs are likely to improve incrementally, not in step changes in intelligence.",

          "text": "I'm not a researcher but an AI architecture builder. Somewhat technical. But I'll answer anyway because I think the question can be framed a bit differently.\n\nSince 2024, \"foundation\" LLM models hit a ceiling. By foundation, I'm referring to pure training where labs would dump somewhat cleaned data on training with SOTA transformers architecture and build the model.\n\nYou'll ask \"but there have been amazing improvements, haven't you seen Opus 4.6 or Codex 5.3?\"\n\nOf course I have. Since o3, AI labs did something else: Inference computing. This is where they use cloud computing so AI can reason before answering a question or performing an instruction. This means a whole new architecture, and particularly OpenAI did very good inference setups, helping AI capabilities further.\n\nDeepSeek saw an opportunity in this inference computing: What if we used cloud computing also to direct tasks towards more \"expert models\", what if we build submodels where AI can decide, \"hey let me have my software engineering brain answer this question\" or \"let me have my math expert brain answer this question\" depending on the query. I'm simplifying obviously, but this is the MoE (mixture of experts architecture).\n\nWith many more improvements like MoE, but primarily at inference time computing, we're now firmly in the \"inner bound agents\" territory, meaning the models that we see now, Opus 4.6, GPT-5.2, etc aren't foundation models anymore but they themselves are agents.\n\nNow on top of these agentic models, people also built tooling & systems. Last one year especially, people added incredible amount of harnesses and tool access and the impact has been visible. But note: The capability isn't improving because of the labs, it's improving because of the people building these harnesses, connectors, skills, MCP servers.\n\nIs there a limit? Labs' training work is somewhat limited IMHO but there's still a lot to be done on test time compute + context window advancements without context rot.\n\nOn the other hand, what others can develop on top of model capabilities: METR benchmark has saturated at this point, not because capabilities didn't advance but because humans can't think of tasks that take more than 96 hours to work on (in humans time). So I guess ai systems will be limited to how complex we can design it.",

He keeps saying he’ll have stop gaps to prevent it from exposing our data, but he knows nothing about databases or networking.\n\nI have cautioned about the fact we can’t really contain it and how no matter how many guardrails you place, it will still be a risk.\n\nThe sales guy has refuted me by asking claude to find a solution.\n\nWhat definitive evidence can I put in front of the CEO to show this is a bad idea?",

Giving it direct read/write access to email means that it can scrape your client data and then send that data somewhere else using the same email. Its fully agentic. This means it has AGENCY. It does what it wants, when it wants.\n\n\nI love the technology. I really do. I trust Claude Code more than most humans. As a business owner myself, OpenClaw is not the right option for businesses.

Your personal information or files may be leaked or stolen.\n2. The agent on its own, or the tools you connect to the bot, may expose you to malicious code or cyber attacks.\n\nThere’s no way to completely protect against all risk, so proceed at your own risk. These are some of the measures we took when testing OpenClaw:\n\n* Run OpenClaw on a separate, clean PC with no personal data, or a virtual machine. Then copy the data you want the agent to have access to.\n* Don’t give it access to your accounts. Instead, create dedicated accounts for the agent and share specific information or access with it. \n* Be careful with what skills you enable, ideally limiting testing to those that have been vetted by the community.\n* Ensure any channels you use to access your OpenClaw assistant, like the web UI or messaging channels, are not accessible without authorization over local networks or the internet.\n* If possible for your use case, limit internet access. \"",

Now you can almost one shot it.  Having the audacity to just do stuff you have no idea how to do is going to go far.  Also pushing the thing farther than anyone else is going to give you a leg up.  When it can't do it now the next model might and you have it all setup.\n\nA builder - some people just do stuff.  Some dream, some plan, but the people who just start doing stuff are going to find lots more done.\n\nCreativity/curiosity- these ones were always true, but it feels like you can get more leverage now\n\nChaos minded - I now context switch like mad and it's exhausting.

For those who don’t know about those, I think this website (https://sites.math.duke.edu/education/postcalc/ode/ode1.html) does a good job at demonstrating and plotting what kinds of solutions you could have at a high level. One thing that I’ve always found interesting is we assume exponential growth, but most systems have an exponential initiation.  But not all systems grow exponentially in perpetuity. The most notable is the logistic curve. The one that shows promising exponential growth then plateaus almost instantly. My question is why does everyone always assume a continued, inexorable exponential growth?",

But \"exponential growth\" could also mean an exponential curve. That's what the AI companies want us to believe.\n\nWell first, how is intelligence quantified? Like beauty, is it even quantifiable? If a beauty product company tells you their products make you exponentially beautiful, you'd have doubts right?\n\nSecond, in computer science, there are a lot of proven intractable problems, meaning that you can't compute the optimal solutions even if you exhaust all the resources in the universe. We usually tackle those problems (e.g., traveling salesman problem) by using sub-optimal approximation algorithms which yields a solution that is say 85% as good as the optimal solutions while using an acceptable amount of resources for compute. In those cases, a god-like AI would only improve the solution by a flat 10% or so. You can't improve that much over existing solutions. Exponential growth can only occur when your existing solution is really really bad, like Will Smith eating spaghetti 10 years ago.\n\nThird, let's take Google's AlphaGo for example. It beats best human Go players, impressive. But how objectively good is AlphaGo? Does it yield a near-optimal solution? I highly doubt. Humans weren't evolved to play Go. I would say even the best humans are probably very bad at Go. We just have no other species to compare outselves against. It could be that the best human players create a 30% optmial solution and AlphaGo creates a 31%. Mathematically it will beat humans everytime but we'd be fooling ourselves to think it is \"exponentially\" better than humans. \n\nThe other thing is, the developers of AlphaGo are themselves masters/grandmasters of Go. AlphaGo wouldn't be possible without their expert-level domain knowledge in Go and machine learning. Same with AlphaFold. There is not a single AI today that just birthes itself with its own architectural design, training data design & optimization design. It's pure fantacy to think expert-level AI system will just pop into existence without human experts engineering the hell out of them in near future.",

Over a short horizon, that can look like a clean exp curve even if the underlying system is piecewise: bursts when a new method/architecture lands, then diminishing returns until the next unlock. People also misuse exponentials as a proxy for compounding, which can be true even when the growth rate itself is declining. The logistic framing is probably closer to reality for any given bottleneck (data, energy, latency, alignment, deployment constraints), but the reason the debate keeps coming back is that the bottleneck might shift: you hit a plateau in one dimension, then a new technique or hardware cycle moves the carrying capacity and you get another apparent exponential segment. So the better model is less exponential forever and more stacked S-curves with uncertainty about where the next ceiling is and how quickly ceilings move.",

Problems with coherence, attention, alignment, and even physical resource limits are real problems not yet solved. \n\nThe core method of pretraining transformers is showing a slowdown. We've seen pretraining performance gains move from exponential looking to linear, while compute itself has become exponentially linked to those gains. Linear return for exponential input, that's a logistic shape right? \n\nWe've seen some techniques to push the boundry, or at least solve transformer related problems, each time we solve one of those problems we get a step up in intelligence. For example, as pretraining gains fall, reenforcement learning and inference time compute have stepped in and given us improvements, hence the step wise component of the curve.\n\nI think we will need another \"attention is all you need\" type revelation before we break out of the current asymptote. The history of this field has shown us two \"AI winters\" so far, I don't think we will see anything that drastic in terms of abandonment, but the big gains are already had and from here it's all consolidation. \n\n\nedit: I took so long to type this out no fewer than 3-4 other people have already pointed out stepwise sigmoid as a candidate.

That problem is not new in AI and algorithm research though, check out some techniques for avoiding local maxima and hill\nclimbing dangers.  As for modal collapse, my understanding is that has to do with the availability of good new training data and the limitations there may be overcome in the future with new data techniques or different model algorithms.  LLMs as an approach are likely a local maxima in the quest for intelligence.  I still think the potential for AI to enter a kind of feedback loop (AI gets better -> improves its code -> is now better at improving itself) is higher than in humans for now, because AI is less constrained by the hardware architecture.  But it’s also still possible there are other limitations which would cause it to plateau further along.",

You can have a large number of semi-autononous workers doing their tasks online. Their \"IQ\" maybe gets improved only linearly, but they can all get the same update in an instant. So, if at some point the effective intelligence of the SOTA models is higher than a typical smart human.. you can plausibly have very large numbers of them. Limited by only cost.

It's an echo of \"network effects\" and going \"hockey stick\". Which comes from an influential book called \"Cold Start Problem\". This book is kinda the playbook of blitzscaling in tech. All of this meaning you have slow adoption, then all of a sudden its explosive.\n\nBut you hit the nail on the head, even the most major and profitable tech companies on the planet had a growth stage and then it leveled out. The key logic error you are making is, when people say improvements will continue to be \"exponential\" they actually know what they are talking about. Even something like the \"internet\", adoption and adaptation followed a curve that has a sigmoid shape. Of course your logistic example being one shape that belongs to the sigmoid class.\n\nI think the people claming \"perpetual exponential improvements\" are hype-bros and grifters. A much more interesting idea is \"where at on the sigmoid curve are we?\". If we are at the end, then hey, humanity has a pretty cool new tool. If we are just barely in the beginning, then who knows what the future holds for us. We'll only be able to see by experiencing if the improvements in AI follow along a similar trajectory to improvements in hardware, like with Moore's Law.",

The systems will run into all sorts of limitations. Maybe they can design hardware, but the hardware has to be physically built, and the raw materials have to be mined. Maybe we build robots to do the mining and manufacturing, but that will be its own long term maturation cycle.\n\nThe AI 10 years from now will be exponentially better than the AI of today, but that doesn't mean runaway god-brain AI.

Labs are getting better at picking out which data helps the model the most, etc. \n\n\n\nyou can kind of think about it like AI Quality Q = p1\\*p2\\*p3\\*p4 , any improvement in any of the above effects the quality of the outputs you get. And they are all improving. Most of them with no real end in sight. \n\n  \nMight not be true exponential, but it will progress. For a while. ",

      "text": "A few days ago I posted that AI is not going to replace developers and it blew up. Some people agreed, some people called me naive, and honestly a lot of the pushback made really good points. So here's where I landed after reading through everything.\n\n1. The junior dev problem is real\n\nIf AI takes all the beginner level work like CRUD apps and basic integrations, where do juniors actually learn? If you do not grow juniors you will not get seniors. Companies cutting junior roles right now are making short term decisions that are going to bite them in a few years when there is nobody left in the pipeline.\n\n2. Vibe coding is going to blow up in people's faces. \n\nAI in the hands of an experienced engineer is powerful. AI in the hands of someone who does not know what to ask or what to look for is useless from a security perspective. You cannot just say make it secure and call it a day. We are already seeing misconfigured databases and exposed API keys from people who do not actually understand what the code is doing. And that is exactly why more people building with AI means more demand for real engineers. Someone has to fix the mess when the business tries to scale.\n\n3. Teams are getting smaller, that part is true. \n\nWe work with businesses and startups and we regularly deliver full SaaS platforms that would have needed much bigger teams a few years ago. AI plus a proven architecture means you can move faster and put resources where they actually matter. But most executives are going to use this to cut headcount, not ship more product. That is just how businesses work where reducing cost is always on top of the list.\n\n4. AI does not need to beat you to replace you. \n\nIt does not have to keep getting better forever. If it is 95% as good as a top developer at a fraction of the cost, that is enough to change the entire market. The models do not need to be perfect, they just need to be good enough and cheap enough.\n\nHere is what I actually stand by: experienced software engineers who know how to leverage AI are more valuable than ever. The ones who understand the business, who can architect systems properly, who can review what AI produces and know when it is wrong. Those people are not going anywhere.",

But making career or business decisions based on something that speculative is risky. I would rather plan around what I can see today and adapt as things change. That is exactly why experienced engineers should be taking advantage of AI right now to move faster, smarter and deliver more. It is what we do at our \"lab\" now, we teach AI a proven architecture we developed and build full software platforms that would have taken much bigger teams, time and a big budget a few years ago. The window to leverage this stuff is wide open and the people who act on it now are going to be way ahead.\n\nOn vibe coding being secure with better AI, maybe. But security is not just about writing safe code. It is about understanding threat models, compliance requirements, business logic edge cases. Better AI might be able to do it but I think we will still have human oversight over security for a long term.",

I see some factors:\n\n1. Token costs are being subsidized now, at least when training costs are considered\n2. Competition is keeping costs in check, if there's consolidation, it could mean going up\n3. As hardware gets cheaper and more powerful (not short term of course!), inference and training costs should go down\n4. If models become larger, inference costs may go up\n5. Maybe 10 years from now, we're all running powerful local LLMs so it's just electricity after initial hardware costs\n\n\n\nCould that app be more efficient? Could it be done partly with traditional code? That's a lot of tokens! ",

But mostly because economy is shit and AI is an easy scapegoat to keep people distracted. That said, a junior with AI to a senior is as bad as a non-technical user vibe coding to that junior. It's pretty painful what gets produced, because it's what people ask for. The less technical you are, the more worthless you are behind a Agent/LLM, even if the LLM feeds your delusions that you are competent.\n\nA path will open up for juniors, but probably in different segments. As software gets dirt cheap, juniors can produce bespoke software grassroots. Not everyone wants to pay a $1k/mo subscription when they could pay $5-10k to get a bespoke/tuned to their business solution made by intermediate/junior people. While the economy is not liking this now, if their is recovery there will be a huge boost on software demand, and these lower tier workers will be doing a lot of that work.\n\n2. Depends on your vibes and skill level. What someone can achieve with \"vibes\" is exponentially proportional to their actual know-how and skill.\n\n3. Some teams are getting smaller, but economics and capitalism does not allow stagnation/breaks. Do you really think that just throwing more AI at the solution is more economically rewarding than throwing Human+AI's at the issue? Smart money is going to accelerate to grab territory while a gold-rush is on, not slow down and take it easy because \"AI\" can do the work.\n\n4. AI can beat me 100x, I hope it does. But it doesn't have direction. AI running on a solo-loop with no human input is the lowest common denominator, anyone can do that. Getting that perfect architecture means someone who is not an idiot is working with AI, i.e. see point 2) Vibe coding.\n\nAlthough I agree with your final point 100%. Developers who know their shit deeply and aren't afraid of AI will be the highest in demand, and that Juniors today are kind of fucked, but I do think a market will open up for them, if they learn and embrace the tools of today.",

I wouldn't consider it at all safe for mission critical large apps. Even if something is entirely coded by AI, you still need a programmer with a good eye to do a review of the code to look for stuff that doesn't make sense. Non-programmers will never be hired by major firms, regardless of how well they get along with their chatbot.\n\nWhen it comes to programmers, I think those that shine will be those who know how to properly leverage AI \\*in tandem\\* with their own work rather than seeking to replace their work. Junior programmers who do just repetitive grunt work won't go far, but I'm pretty sure junior programmers who demonstrate an acute understanding of AI and how to leverage it for greatly increased productivity will easily find work. In fact, in time, employers will seek out those who are great at prompting and otherwise interacting with AI over those with just lots of programming experience. So veteran programmers can't just rest on their laurels with the idea that \"oh well, at least I'm not a junior programmer, so I'm safe\". If a new hire can code 10x faster than a veteran who still insists on hand coding everything, that veteran programmer won't work for much longer. ",

          "text": "Eh idk. To be honest, developers have been so actively targeted that I do not see a reality, where in 10 years there is work for even 1/10 of the current devs. I could imagine that even in 5 years, we will have work for maybe 1/4 or 1/5 as many devs as now, if not less.\n\n\nI thought this at the very beginning in 2022 (when Chat got came out) and was labeled as irrational. After many people told me I am too worried, I decided to accept that and I feel it was a huge mistake. At that time, I could have more easily pivoted towards something else, as I was just finishing my BSc. Now that I have done my MSc., I just don't feel like going through studying again. At some point, you just want to work and reap the fruit of your efforts. That does not mean not developing yourself, but certainly not dedicating most of your free time off work towards that.\n\n\n\nI really regret not doing mechanical engineering, because at the rate things are progressing, studying CS and becoming a dev is a complete waste of time. With mechanical, at least you may work  in a field, where the legal framework requires a human oversight. Not to mention that the amount of data for the AI to learn from is significantly smaller. \n\n\nAnd let's be honest, most CS programs do not prepare you to be a dev. The only exception may be going into the AI field, but that usually requires lots of targeted courses. And it's not like the AI field is not a hyper competitive environment. Hardware is usually only gone over at a surface level, so it is all revolving around Software, and AI is already outperforming many of us.\n\n\nNowadays, I tell everyone not to study CS. It is way too much effort and in the end, you don't actually have any skills that AI could not replace. The amount of code on the Internet is too large and too many people are using AI models nowadays for them to not improve. \n\n\nThe agentic stuff really changed everything and I will be extremely surprised if a very large portion of devs are not obsolete in 2-3 years tops.\n\n\nI find It sad, because I love writing code and creating things. It is pure copium if people think that allowing people to create more with less skill is not going to result in skilled people not being needed. Sure, you might have some extremely specialized devs, but those will be the absolute cream of the current crop. Statistically speaking, that will be an extremely small minority. Most of us, even the above average ones, will not be part of that group.\n\n\nThat being said, I think people in the legal profession and accounting should also be worried. Most of that work can, imo, be done much quicker and infinitely cheaper by AI. And for those saying \"yeah, but AI still makes mistakes\" - that's what devs were saying for the past few years and look where we are now. It's a matter of time IMO and the time frame is likely very small.\n\n\nI sincerely hope I am wrong and we all keep having high-paying careers. I just don't see a logical explanation why that should be the case. The whole \"dev using AI will take a job of the dev not doing it\" is pure copium IMO, at least mid- to long-term. Short term, it may be true.",

So what applies to Developers would apply to the other white collar professions. Professions that pay well . Folks who earn well and spend well. When they all or bulk of them either take a huge pay cut or lose jobs consumer spending would take a  big hit. Mortgage repayments would take a big hit.  Consumption of products/services being produced/offered by the same companies that are involved in layoffs/slashing paychecks would take a big hit.\n\nEventually economy will take a hit and what it basically would mean  that companies who are laying off their IT staff/white collar professionals or paying them peanuts won't have too many buyers for that products.  No matter what jugglery they should do those companies are going to take a hit. If those companies are going to take a big hit who will be the consumer for the AI models ?  Yes thy might initially go for more AI to reduce costs further but frankly this is more likely to be a bottom of the barrel strategy.\n\nI know people talk of economy being very different to what it is today and relevance of money  changing but that is all mainly theory.\n\nFurther there is economics and then there is politics. When the existing economy tanks or let us say take a hit and people are not so well off (due to unemployment or big pay cuts) and it is not a transient phase but more of a long term outlook the Political class will be forced to act --I am talking about democratic or semi-democratic societies. Populist leaders will take over and act. And in many cases you won't even need populists.\n\nSo a possible outcome would be:-\n\nPolitical action might result in UBI or rehiring with good pay checks (minimum wages might be recalibrated) -- We have to see that.  Point is ipeople retaining their present economic station or close to it would become somewhat important for the political class as well.

If everything is completely automated this basically means that everybody is going to be locked into their own atomized personal bubbles where they are fed their own curated entertainment, art, etc. think of the humans in wall-e. Human relationships break down because we will no longer need anybody to make us happy and fulfilled, we can just have AI push all of the right buttons to release all of the right chemicals. Our life becomes one of constant passive consumption and no actual value being produced. How is that not a dystopia? \n\nI get the idea that AI and automation might just handle all of the ‘tedious’ work that ‘nobody wants to do,’ and that would leave us to focus on the ‘creative’ stuff, and certainly if there was a clear line between them, I would support working towards that goal. But I don’t think there is such a categorical difference after all. I think that all human work requires both labor and creativity. You cannot separate the two. Labor requires creativity, and creativity requires labor. They are two sides of the same coin. So a world in which there is no labor is a world without creativity. And look, we now have generative AI, which calls into question even the value of the ‘creative’ stuff we wanted to spend our lives pursuing in a post-scarcity economy.",

But from now until then, a large amount of people being unemployed without UBI will cause a ton of pain for a lot of people.

My take is a very idealistic what could potentially happen in the future. I’m not even fully convinced that will be how it goes. But ideally using AI instead of human labor will lower costs across the board until eventually money will become irrelevant and UBI itself becomes unnecessary. There is still a business/economic calculation to be made if you know that people have only x amount of money and you squeeze them too hard then they will buy less things. So you know it’s just a bad business decision to price gouge. Especially if businesses become more of a monopoly and own many products and services. Would you rather the “customer” only be able to afford 3 of your products or be able to buy 5? Current society can’t really be compared with a society where the majority are on a fixed UBI.

The govt. is reactive rather than proactive.\n\nThey'll wait until unemployment hits 10% before they lift a finger, then they'll hit the panic button and enact COVID style unemployment benefits and mortgage foreclosure moratoriums. They'll also push \"upskilling\" initiatives, which will be completely pointless and a waste of cash since all jobs will eventually be automated.\n\nThere will probably be a lot of anger as there was during COVID about relief checks being too small and coming too slow to be helpful. $1,000 every few months won't put food on the table, let alone pay bills.\n\nAround 20% the govt. will smash the big red panic button like a gambling addict in Vegas. There will be massive infrastructure projects (ie: Hoover dam or road upgrades) to artificially create jobs while the govt. scrambles to figure out what the new economic model should look like and how they can transition from our current model. Unfortunately, this isn't something that can be thrown together at the last minute. It's going to take years of planning and global coordination on a scale we've never seen.\n\n Depending on how long that stage goes, you'll probably see protests and rioting as people lose everything they own and banks collapse and need to be absorbed by other banks or the govt. The governments of the world will probably go to war because they can't agree and the political pressure to solve the problem is enormous.\n\nEventually, the victor will dictate the new economic model. If the luddites have their way with their data center moratoriums, then this means China will dictate the world's economic model if they don't outright control our country. (yay luddites?)\n\nOnce the dust settles, no matter who wins, economically we are almost certain to have a better system than we currently have. Yes, there are many dystopian options, but I don't see those being realistically accepted by the masses and the countries won't have the enormous number of robots needed to enforce their ill-will. Not to mention a single EMP would wipe out any such army.",

Everyone is worried to see their entire life of hard work nullified overnight by the ultra-rich ones obsession to hoard everything for themselves, permanently. And just get told to piss off immediately after.\n\n\nLet's face it: most business owners have been bragging about the idea of \"finally getting rid of those stinky poors thanks to AI\" for the entire time, without ever caring about what will be of those who won't be able to find a place in a society where the 99% is no longer needed.

It pays _less,_ but I'd even do it for free if it wasn't that I need to pay the bills. Soon after, genAI came out and I saw legions of people chanting about such job rendered obsolete, celebrating the idea its workers losing their livelihood and forced to go elsewhere.\nIf what they say becomes true, back into the factory I go. Back into being depressed. Back into using machines that will cost you a limb the instant you put your guard down.\n\n\nIf AI was to make work not mandatory, I'd just do the job I like for fun. Most people would be fine with that. But as it is right now, it's all just going back into menial factory jobs AI isn't prospected to automate any time soon, with currently exposed tech.

In most of these countries the people in power, either by holding a high position in the government or literally being the head of a militia, basically don't need citizens.   \n  \nOil fields can be maintained by a relatively small group of people and can produce a lot of wealth. Enough that those in power don't need to provide rights or opportunities to the civilian population. The value produced by the oilfields is so much higher than anything citizens could produce that if they were incorporated into the economy they'd become a net drag on the whole system.\n\nThe only reasons most oil producing countries care for their civilian populations is:  \nA: They have strong institutions prior to getting access to oil. Think Norway.  \nB. They have the foresight to plan their economy for when after the oil runs out. Think the UAE  \nC: They fear what will happen when the civilian population becomes hostile to the government.\n\nWith AI, the value it produces won't run out like oil. If anything the gap between the value civilians can generate vs AI will just become larger. This negates option B. Additionally, AI will eventually be able to run fully automated militaries so the threat of civilians or even a military coup gets reduced significantly as direct power gets concentrated into the hands of the few, which negates option C.\n\nConsequently, the only way we as civilians can make sure our countries don't dispose of us is by making long lasting institutional changes now while we still have power. If we don't, eventually the amount of money we produce by taxes will be dwarfed by the tax produced by AI and AI companies and we'll just have to hope that either the military or our current institutions (e.g. the constitution) still protects us.\n\nThis is all probably sounding quite messy, my thoughts are still not made up on this. But I'm not convinced UBI will save us. If a country needs to pay to keep it's civilians placid surely the countries which successfully get rid of their civilians will have an advantage because they aren't spending resources supporting a giant unproductive group of people.   \n  \nIf civilians can't offer net-value to a country, why would they ever be supported?",

Actually, we would probably be quite alright living our new hobo lives since everyone else would be a hobo too. No shame in that. But do people really think they'd let that happen?

It inspired me to write a few basic games (in BASIC!) that used AI. I've been following the developments since then.\n\nAI could be the best thing ever. AI could make education so much better, custom-tailored for each student. Provide affordable access to medical services, make public services cheaper and more efficient, advance science, make discoveries, etc. Basically, improve the lives of billions around the world, particularly those with lower resources today.\n\nUnfortunately we're not on that trajectory today.\n\nWe're the trajectory to replace workers (particularly knowledge workers for the benefit of corporations and CEOs. We're in the trajectory of creating billions of AI-addicted people through the exploitation of intimacy with chatbots. We're in the trajectory of mass unemployment, an explosion in loneliness and a future of state (or private) dependency unparalleled in history.\n\nAll of this brought to you by a handful of billionaires with inflated egos and no accountability, that feel entitled to decide the future of world, and for whom the collapse of society and the downfall of humanity are acceptable -and maybe even desirable- outcomes. The people forcing this on us are insulated from any consequences.\n\nSome of these CEOs have publicly said that there's a non-zero percentage chance AGI / ASI will exterminate us all.  I often hear the analogy of building a bridge. If you build a bridge and it would have a 10% chance of falling, would go across? Of course not. Its just not worth it.\n\nBut the analogy is just not complete. It doesn't really reflect the danger nor the accountability of those people building the bridge. A more accurate analogy would be like this:\n\n*There's a dozen people building a bridge, and it has a 10% chance of collapsing. They actually dont really know what's on the other side of the bridge, but they want ALL HUMANITY to cross the bridge, whether they like it or not. By the way, the 12 people building the bridge (and their families) all have parachutes and protection, so even if the bridge falls down, they will still be ok.*\n\n***I'm not anti-AI. I'm anti THAT AI. I'm anti dystopia by default.***\n\nI've been listening to a few people that share these concerns and I want to widen their message. In particular:\n\nCentre for Humane technology: [https://www.humanetech.com/](https://www.humanetech.com/)\n\nControl AI : [https://controlai.com/about](https://controlai.com/about)\n\nPlease do have a listen what they saying.\n\nOne common theme about these two organizations is that they saw ground-level resistance and voicing opinions is key. Companies and billionaires respond to incentives but also respond to public opinion. Silence is a green light.\n\nIf you don't want dystopia by default, take action. Spread the message.",

          "text": "I'm sympathetic to the core argument: the most consequential choices about deployment are being made by a small set of actors with asymmetric upside, limited accountability, and a habit of externalizing harm. Even if you strip away the AGI-doom rhetoric, the nearer-term trajectory you describe is real: firms are incentivized to replace labor, maximize engagement, and treat human relationship as a product surface, and the social costs land on everyone else. At the same time, it's worth aiming the critique at mechanisms, not archetypes: procurement rules, liability, auditability, privacy law, labor policy, and competition policy are the levers that change outcomes regardless of who's in the CEO chair. If people want AI that helps instead of AI that extracts, the most effective organizing tends to look boring: push for clear standards, third-party testing, data rights, limits on manipulative use cases, and real consequences for reckless deployment. That's how you turn anti dystopia by default into something that actually steers the tech.",

Companies will still compete, but they’ll compete in a world where the underlying production is nearly free.\n\nAnd the internet didn’t fail because abundance is impossible.

It was the system adjusting to a new economic reality.\n\nThe age of abundance doesn’t arrive politely. It arrives like a flood.",

Obviously, every single company that is doing layoffs right now is not attempting to do the latter. \n\nAI is the perfect excuse, while being the next step of productive increase. What is attempting to occur is that AI will serve as a new laboring tool that shortens, exponentially, the requirement of workers- using AI tools will let companies do more work with less people.

Amazon is an absolute giant with its own structural dynamics and internal challenges, many of which were highlighted in the video, that simply aren’t representative of most companies in the industry.\n\nI work in a managing role at a large EU-based IT services company that deploys 10k+ consultants across a broad range of IT domains. As we speak, we are seeing AI-powered SDLC pipelines not only being developed, but actively deployed and used in production environments. In some cases, they reduce the required human workforce on a project by up to 80%.\n\nWhere you previously needed eight distinct roles such as business analyst, solution architect, developer, tester, DevOps, and so on, this can now be reduced to a small group of sharp “analysts” who are not analysts in the traditional sense, but people who capture business requirements and translate them into structured prompts and system instructions for AI tooling. On top of that, you might need one or two experienced professionals to provide oversight, quality control, and governance.\n\nThe impact on IT is astronomical.\n\nThat said, there are serious bottlenecks. Data quality. Data governance where it even exists. Clearly defined use cases. Mature information architecture. Without these, AI acceleration quickly stalls.\n\nIn other white-collar domains, the potential impact is, in my opinion, very similar, but the bottlenecks are often even more severe. Many organizations lack structured processes, coherent information governance, and unified tooling. It’s common to see departments using ten different platforms, with fragmented workflows and scattered data. Legacy complexity alone can paralyze transformation efforts.\n\nAnd this is just the present moment.\n\nIf you look at where we were two years ago, the pace of evolution is absolutely crazy. The only safe assumption I think is that this current trajectory continues. If not, then we'll see. But the current rate at which it is going forces us to think ahead.\n\nIf the ratios I mentioned are even remotely representative of what’s coming, then the scale of change could be enormous. At some point, you have to ask whether our current economic model can absorb that level of workforce reduction without fundamental shifts. A sudden, large-scale displacement of white-collar labor would challenge the system itself.\n\nThat said, no one, not even the big AI providers, benefits from a collapsed (or impacted) purchasing power or employment structures. A gradual evolution is far more likely, and far more sustainable, than a sudden “everyone loses their job” revolution.\n\nMy take: the SciFi ultra-lightning-fast race cars have arrived, but the roads have yet to be built.",

The company continues to insist on two specific restrictions: It doesn’t want its technology used for surveillance of US citizens or for autonomous lethal strikes without a human in the loop.\n\nAnthropic said that while the Pentagon’s latest proposal fell short, the company continues to negotiate with defense officials and remains committed to working with the military. A Pentagon spokesperson had no immediate comment. Read the full story [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-26/anthropic-spurns-latest-pentagon-bid-to-defuse-feud-over-ai-work). ",

Previously we automated physical effort or time consuming tasks. We made work physically easier and would take less time. But we never automated thinking. Humans still had to think and solve problems. Now the implementation of the solution is what we made easier. But AI automates thinking, or atleast thats what they are aiming to achieve soon. So now if an AI can think like a human and do work like a human. What will a human do? Any new jobs we will create will be given to the AI agents because they will eventually be better than humans at thinking and solving problems. Thats my theory atleast. Thoughts?",

Math calculations are not physical effort.\n\nYou are not taking the concept of demand elasticity into account.\n\nThe computer automated Math calculation.  The demand went way up with the needs of developing nuclear weapons and the H-bomb in particular.  And the electronic computer offered a cheap way to fulfill this demand for millions or billions of human computers. It did the work of millions or billions of humans, but it did not drive billions out of work.\n\nThe computer made is cheaper to do stuff that was previously too expensive to do.  So more got done.  This is an example of demand elasticity,\n\nAI may have to truly understand the real world to cheaply automate creativity, planning, complex communications, analysis of requirements, supervision, and management in the context of an enormous increase in demand.  Otherwise, there may be sufficient human jobs.\n\nHow soon will AI be able to meet its energy demand without employing humans?",

The land gets rain and snow, and it soaks in the ground.  No plants pull it out.  so they have 2 years rain to grow 1 year's crop.  \n\nThey already have smart spray machinery.  100 feet wide.

I don’t believe we’re anywhere near that point yet however I do see that in the future. With each advancement new jobs are created however eventually that won’t be the case. \n\nEven with my limited AI and coding knowledge I’ve developed a home AI network assistant that has not only read access but write access also for various systems. Just the other day it managed to diagnose a corrupted FreeBSD network stack after testing the system network, dhcp, switch connectivity etc. It even has access via IPMI to access the system to eventually recompile a new stack. Voice recognition and speech capabilities so it’s like having an actual assistant there. It worked the problem explaining each step. It must wait for my verification before issuing root commands with some exemptions like restarting services. \n\nI mean the entire system, 8 VMs with one AI, could have literally problem solved and corrected the issue on its own if I allowed it to. For now I don’t since I still find a few mistakes occasionally. Still… this is what I’ve been able to do with AI in less than 6 months. Tell me a team of developers, coders and engineers couldn’t do this professionally on a huge scale and replace entire IT teams later savings companies millions+ in salaries, benefits, etc.  \n\nSure, they aren’t 100% correct right now but with new technology and how fast we’re advancing… many current IT jobs will definitely be replaced with AI. Coding, system administration, etc type jobs… a single person will be able to manage soon what a dozen or 100s or 1000s do today.\n\nI’ve honestly been blown away by how much I’ve been able to move forward with this project that started out as asking ChatGPT if a local AI could fully maintain and update a network documentation wiki for me. I added remote log monitoring, network monitoring, voice capabilities etc..\n\nHeck, it even uses the rooms camera to recognize my wife anytime she walks in and behaves as if I’m caught… “quick get dressed, your wife just walked in”! In a sultry female voice. 😆 Yeah.. my wife near collapsed the first time she walked in after that. 🤣\n\nI’ve got a good inquisitive mind, have developed a strong detailed system prompt and spent a few weeks researching AI communication queries which has really helped.",
