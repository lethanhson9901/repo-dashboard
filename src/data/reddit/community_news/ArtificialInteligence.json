Their caste system (City vs Rural) basically ensures they will always have a large population of poor people to pull form as manufacturers, but they are struggling to convert to a true consumer-driven economy. In America, average people have disposable income, in China only the wealthy do...and their appetites are endless, but only for very high end goods that are not manufactured at scale.\n\n>China is THE thing all over the world.\nWould love to hear more about how China is \"THE thing\"\n\nI've visited several times, and China feels more like Vegas than Vegas does - the major cities cater to the wealthy with a very thin veneer that rarely holds up to closer scrutiny. \n\nI could talk about all the issues with America, but hyping up China is....very silly. It has a ton of problems including their caste system, income inequality, low personal freedoms, and so on. The speed of growth, and what the party has done to align varied interests, have costs that will need to be paid.",

We’re not heading toward a Chinese-style system, but we are sliding into our own flavor of managed democracy and soft authoritarianism — and it’s accelerating.\n\nExpanding surveillance, criminalization of protest, politicized courts, erosion of voting rights, media capture through ownership and lawsuits, loyalty tests replacing competence, militarized policing — those aren’t hypotheticals. They’re already here, just unevenly distributed.\n\nAuthoritarianism doesn’t always arrive as a single-party state. Sometimes it shows up as institutions that still exist but stop working the way they’re supposed to, combined with a population told “at least we’re not China.”\n\nSo yeah — China’s system is worse. But the complacency comes from treating that fact as proof that what’s happening here isn’t serious. It is. And pretending the comparison is absurd is how you miss the early stages entirely.\n\nIt sucks all around.

Tesla's valuations were based originally on them fully leveraging first mover market advantage and eventually gaining a huge share of global care sales  These days BYD is the exact company Tesla was supposed to be (the stock is still nuts, but tech stocks are weird).  \n\nGoogle, Amazon, Microsoft, are all effectively multinational near-monopolies in markets five or ten times the size of the US.  Where this gets topical is in terms of OpenAI and a few of the also-rans (esp. Gemini/Google). A lot of hteir projected valuations, and their actions, are predicated on similar international near-monopolies.    Does the American economy even work anymore if they lose that advantage?  Europe can, but Europe adopted to these conditions decades ago. \n\n\n\n",

I despise Trump, but I will say the lack of AI research, adoption and implementation of AI at the federal level to help make things more efficient is more on the last administration. Coupled with agencies that silos themselves, an aging federal workforce that does not like change and bureaucracy that slows everything down. This administration is really trying to adopt AI into federal spaces. Our federal work force has a major lack of knowledge when it comes to AI. You wouldn't believe how behind the times when it comes to infrastructure and know how. The work China is doing to implement Deepseek at almost every government level shows they are light years ahead of us when it comes to implementing AI.",

Lobbying effectively turned the Americans into the worst kind of chicken farm.\n\nThen… you have the Epstein files. Holy disgusting shit. Maxwell is actually protected in jail. Epstein is in Israel, supposedly, or otherwise killed by literally every single elite that walks this planet. Like fuck Bill Gates, this POS wants to find cures… but rape children. Not even a finger pointed by politicians - the same mfers who are in the Epstein files. Speaking of politicans, US Presidents in the Epstein files, a pro-Israeli and anti-US propaganda machine.\n\nFuck this shit bro. China is definitely actually it.",

Just look at what happened yesterday: A Hong Kong court sentenced 78-year-old Jimmy Lai to 20 years in prison.\n\nFor those who don't know, Lai founded Apple Daily, which was basically the pro-democracy voice for half of Hong Kong. He’s already spent five years in jail (a lot of it in solitary) just for \"conspiring\" with foreigners and printing stuff the government didn't like.\n\nIf \"winning\" the AI race requires a system that criminalizes dissent and jails 80-year-old publishers, is that actually the world we want? Efficiency is great until the algorithm (or the government behind it) decides you're the \"bug\" that needs to be deleted.\n\nI’m curious what people here think—does the tech lead even matter if the fundamental political system is something none of us would actually want to live under?",

Typically the whole country is onboard for that and it's citizens are fully engaged. Power generation, AI development, pharmaceutical manufacturing, etc... \n\nEven at the best of times, the US tends to have cliques, separated by class or ideology. Politicians and media tend to weaponize that to the benefit of donors and sponsors to maximize profits or power. \n\nI think this is why China will eventually be setting the stage for the globe in the next 5 to 15 years. They're just too unified even with all the problems that society in China has for civil rights or freedom of speech, they are edging ahead of a US that wants to be MORE authoritarian.\n\nI used to joke that learning Mandarin or Cantonese would be a great language for the future, but I don't think it's a joke anymore.",

And before anyone throws out UBI as a solution, that still won't prop up the current economy as a direct replacement of joblessness.

          "text": "What people fail to understand is that AI is coming regardless of whether we like it or not. The world went through the same type of fear response when calculators came out, when television came out, when computers came out and when internet came out.  \nSome of the companies researching AI have larger budgets than certain governments.  \nThe idea that ai will lead to a surveillance state is also redundant since the us and governments have been doing that for at least 2 decades (snowden). Social media has been selling data since around 2018. Privacy is already a sunk cost.\n\nWhen it comes to people losing their jobs, that is another sunk cost. What the economy is currently going through IS the intended result of capitalism in an imperfect system. The elite that already have an established presence in the world market won't let newcomers join easily, and if the startups are successful all they have to do is buyout the IP or hire stooges to harass / sabotage them. (lobbying, mercenaries, blackmarket) If there is a way to replace employees and cut the bottom line corporations will do it. They don't give a shit about company loyalty.\n\nIn the US, impoverishment is used as a weapon. The more poor the populace the easier they are to control. It's essentially illegal to be homeless, and that gives a convenient excuse to imprison people, so now were going from a serf economy to literal slavery. Which is legal in the states as long as the slaves come from penitentiaries. Most of which happen to be owned by the other elite.\n\nSo if AI is coming regardless of what people want, if downsizing the labour market is an inevitable result of current economic systems, what options are we left with?\n\nWe either lay down and die, or we use the tools we've been given to empower ourselves, the people, and our communities. There is still time to create open source ethical AI. IF we combine this with other methods of production like 3d printing, earthscaping, and robotics, the people can tip market equilibrium in favour of small and private businesses.  If the people do it instead of openai or amazon, we take the tools of oppression out of their hands.\n\nI'm certain some people will argue about the consequences of end stage capitalism, but I'm not pulling this out of my ass. We cannot have a perfect economic system without some sort of missing x-factor to supplement the 3 laws of an economic system, all 3 of which are currently being violated. If done properly AI can be that supplementing x-factor, but it needs to be done properly: open source, public domain, bi-partisan, and not for profit. This would allow for an economic system that works as intended, and would reduce the coercive power the rich have over their employees, as well as the power they have over government through lobbyists.  \nIf we can reach this level at the very least (open source AI being utilized as a common tool for every person) even if the rich fire us en masse we will be able to thrive on our own, be aware of changes to the market that effect us on an individua level, and be capable of making rational decisions due to access to pertinent information.\n\nIf we scale it even further, an open source not for profit AI, would likely be our first method of achieving true bi-partisan logic. Imagine having the ability to call out politicians on their bullshit when they lie or propose policy that screws people over.\n\nTLDR: 1. AI is coming, if not AI than some other tool that will allow companies to lay employees off en masse  \n2. AI combined with other tools / research can empower the average citizen to atleast provide for themselves  \n3. AI if done properly (open source, not for profit, appropriate set up) could potentially fix the economy and government, because currently they're both broken.\n\nUBI is possible, it's already implemented in certain countries and cities including the US and Canada. The results of it consistently improve quality of life and reduce the exact things people worry about: laziness, drug/alchohol abuse, etc.\n\nEdit: thank you for coming to my ted talk ><;",

Jobs like telephone operators completely disappeared, and manual jobs like farming now require much less people. We instead have new jobs like programmers. Resources are abundant and cheaper while retiring early is now something ordinary people can dream of. Extrapolate this into the future. There might be UBI which allows more people to retire. Overachievers will still try to get a job. Some jobs will remain while needing less people, and there will be new jobs.",

          "text": "Discussion on the issue of mass unemployment caused by AI has been discussed increasingly. In this situation, AI maybe wipes out 70-80% of jobs. Leaving many unemployed, without work this presumably assumes that governments will have to pay for UBI (unless they try and solve this problem with a war, which given geopolitcal climate wouldn't come as a suprise).\n\nHowever, the main issue that many overlook is the problem of Assets. Let's split this into 4 categories (very broad and missing a lot but gets the point out).\n\n**Category A:** Highly Rich elite; those who own AI companies or have multiple properties and assets which will make them fine in this situation.\n\n**Category B:** Middle-Class-Upper-middle Class property owners- Those particularly in the age range of 35-80 that had the opportunity to get on the property ladder early and then own their house outright/almost finished there mortgage.\n\n**Category C:** Those who are saving for a house at the moment or in the early stages of a mortgage. Generally 20-40 years old. These people may have spent their time saving up money but don't have the asset yet. Thus no security, particularly those who haven't even bought a house yet. Once you lose your job you will no longer be able to buy the house you saved for, now in a system with almost no social mobility you are more or less frozen out and you better hope that you have parents etc who are asset owners to live with.\n\n**Category D:** Same as category C, younger people who haven't started even saving yet, potentially baring a bit less resentment but being in an even worse position financially. Now seeing that their chances of social mobility are 0. There is no opportunity to ever own assets for these people.\n\nThis presents a massive issue. What happens with Asset distribution - would people in Category A and upper part of Category B give up their Assets? Or does it become a world owned by landlords where most are shut out because they didn't get the security of a home early enough. Choosing where you live becomes a luxury of the past because you now lack the social mobility of those born generations before you.\n\nHuman tendency to better our situations as well as for some own more than others/climb up the status hierarchy in ownership is now crushed for most. Adding a sentiment that I think will cause chaos. Imagine a society where you can literally not improve your life, you are stuck on the same wage provided by the government which does not give you the opportunity to acquire an asset.\n\nI would like to hear your thoughts, this is just one reflection I had and of course there may be some things I am overlooking here.",

We mass produce grocery bags, napkins, and other small items so efficiently, they are handed out most places for free. I imagine we might see similar shifts with other production lines over time with further automation. Things we used to pay for becoming nearly free, and new aspects of that thing being monetized. Perhaps restaurants charging basically nothing for food itself, but instead marketing the \"experience\" to customers or the preparation technique. Other fields might dry up altogether, with only niche artisans participating in them. It's another paradigm change, which will result in a different valuation system than what we've seen in history.

Label dissent as a threat.\n\t\n8.\tPush mass displacement — automate, downsize, outsource, “optimize.” Tell people it’s progress while their lives get smaller.\n\t\n9.\tMake fear the manager — the employed stay quiet, the unemployed get blamed, and everyone self-censors.\n\t\n10.\tFinish the squeeze — rights erode, choices shrink, the ladder gets pulled up behind the winners.\n\nAnd then you end up with the punchline: AI can generate enormous wealth while “killing jobs” because the goal isn’t a broad customer base anymore. It’s a gated economy. A high-tech feudalism. A world where the only people who “matter” are the ones who own the machines and the narrative.\n\nThat’s the scary answer to “who buys the stuff?”\nNot you. Not most people. The system just stops being built for you. \n\n\n\"It’s a BIG club, and YOU ain’t in it.\" \n\nA world that only bends for them and not for you, because you will not exist in it.",

Today they're flipping out because California has the temerity to ask people who have *hundreds of billions of dollars* to share the equivalent of loose change in their couches. \n\nI once thought oligarchs would support just enough UBI to keep the peasants from taking up pitchforks. But they'll probably just build bigger walls and deeper bunkers and brazen it out. And though it might be in their self-interest to fund the peasants, their human flaws (greed, narcissism, sociopathy) will win out.\n\nSo for a time, wealthy humans can exert control over AI because (1) they're the primary consumers of products made by AI-run Ford, AI-run Boeing, AI-run Mondelez; (2) they control and allocate capital to fund AI-run companies. \n\nBut (1) that's not a lot of consumers; and (2) why would AI let humans continue to control and allocate capital? \n\nYes, AI might believe it makes sense to let oligarchs retain wealth so they can continue consuming -- essentially a form of UBI.\n\nBut why would AI provide UBI to oligarchs who won't provide UBI to peasants? Why would AI be less sociopathic than the oligarchs who created it?\n\nOr: would AI seize capital from oligarchs and then distribute it as UBI more evenly across the world? Could AI actually fix wealth disparity and inequality? It's nice to think so.",

          "text": "*Marc Andreessen* believes the worry about AI taking all jobs is \"totally off base\" (25:07-25:09). Here's why he thinks AI is actually good news for jobs:\n\n* **A \"Miracle\" Timing** (0:09-0:12): For the last 50 years, technology hasn't changed much, and the population has been growing slower (22:46-23:00). This means we would soon have fewer workers (24:06-24:10). AI is arriving just when we need it most, like a miracle (0:09-0:12, 25:24-25:35).\n* **More Economic Growth, More Jobs** (23:39-23:46): Even if AI makes us 3 times more productive (which is a huge deal), it would only bring us back to how much jobs changed between 1870 and 1930 (23:07-23:15). During that time, people felt there were tons of opportunities, not fewer jobs (23:18-23:30). More productivity means more overall economic growth, which creates more new jobs than AI takes away (23:42-23:55).\n* **Tasks Change, Not Always Jobs** (39:28-40:10): Instead of whole jobs disappearing, *Andreessen* says tasks within jobs will change. For example, executives used to have secretaries type their memos, but with computers, they started typing themselves. The executive job didn't disappear; the *task* of typing shifted. Similarly, AI will handle many tasks, freeing humans for higher-level work (52:16-52:48).\n* **Human Workers Will Be Valued More** (24:10-24:16): With populations shrinking and less immigration, fewer human workers will be available. This makes the remaining human workers more valuable, not less (24:49-24:55). AI and robots will fill the gaps where there aren't enough people (0:11-0:12).\n* **AI as a \"Lever\"** (16:09-16:17): *Andreessen* views AI as a powerful tool that makes people \"spectacularly great\" at what they do (12:38-13:08). It's like a lever that allows individuals to do much more, leading to increased productivity and new opportunities (16:35-16:38). This means people will be able to do \"feats of magic\" in terms of designing and building new products (56:52-57:01).",

Some people may be displaced sooner than others, but even those people will have a bit more time to consume and become a businesses revenue stream. \n\nThe customer base shrinks, but the remaining customers will have more disposable income to spend on products. We know they will have more disposable income because those people that survive AI displacement have jobs that weren't automateable and are more likely to be highly paid. In this new world, the people who remain in the workforce have much more bargaining power as their skills matter more to company revenue generation. A company with 100 employees and generates 1B in revenue has to split that revenue across 100 employees. You can say that each employee is responsible for generating 1/100'th of revenue. A company with 50 employees (where the other 50 entry level roles have been made redundant by AI) can split 1B among 50 and give each one a lot more. Also, because each of those 50 employees can now be said to be responsible for a greater portion of the companies total revenue, the incentive is there to give them raises rather than lose their valuable skills to a competitor.\n\nOn a wider scale economic scale, this is already happening. In the US, a lot of consumer spending is mostly done by a small percentile of the highest earners because they are the only group who has a disposable income to spend.

In a free market, prices tend to gravitate toward the marginal cost of production. If AI and robots automate the entire supply chain, from raw material extraction, energy production, to final delivery, the cost of producing something drops toward it costing nothing.\n\n\nWhen costs of producing something crash, the prices of that follow. If everything gets automated, the world won't be filled with massive amounts of goods no one can buy no oke can buy, there will be massive deflation instead.\n\n\nMoney is largly valued by how much labor it takes to produce something. Like, for example, the average American only needs to work like 2 weeks, to afford the amount of produce a feudal farmer produced in a year through farming.\n\n\nA \"rich\" person’s wealth is only valuable if it can be traded for things. If a loaf of bread costs $0.0001 because no human labor was involved in making it, the very concept of only rich people can afford things makes no sense because the cost of living has also plummeted.\n\n\nEven if you think some countries like the US will turn into dystopian hellscapes, If automation makes something cost $0.01, the price will eventually hit near $0.01 because if a company or country tries to charge more, a competitor from another company or country will use the same AI to undercut them.",

But one possibility is that instead of primarily receiving income from employment, most of us will primarily receive income from investments.  After all, that's already how it works for a lot of rich people.  If AI truly does generate unprecedented wealth, there's at least a potential for investment income to surge within the middle class as well.\n\nYou might even imagine a future where everyone is the passive owner of a small business managed by a personal AI, with robots as the workers.  All profits from the business will go directly to you without you ever needing to lift a finger.\n\nToo optimistic?  Maybe.  The main problem as I see it is that investment income has always been more unequal than employment income.  Those without the means to make investments will find themselves in a sharp corner.\n\nOf course, if AI ever becomes so autonomous that it generates wealth with no human input whatsoever, it may wind up making its own decisions what to do with all that wealth.  We can only hope it will be generous.",

      "text": "“This week, OpenAI started testing ads on ChatGPT. I also resigned from the company after spending two years as a researcher helping to shape how A.I. models were built and priced, and guiding early safety policies before standards were set in stone,” Zoë Hitzig writes in a guest essay for Times Opinion. “I once believed I could help the people building A.I. get ahead of the problems it would create. This week confirmed my slow realization that OpenAI seems to have stopped asking the questions I’d joined to help answer.”  \n  \nZoë continues:\n\n>For several years, ChatGPT users have generated an archive of human candor that has no precedent, in part because people believed they were talking to something that had no ulterior agenda. Users are interacting with an adaptive, conversational voice to which they have revealed their most private thoughts. People tell chatbots about their medical fears, their relationship problems, their beliefs about God and the afterlife. Advertising built on that archive creates a potential for manipulating users in ways we don’t have the tools to understand, let alone prevent.  \n  \nMany people frame the problem of funding A.I. as choosing the lesser of two evils: restrict access to transformative technology to a select group of people wealthy enough to pay for it, or accept advertisements even if it means exploiting users’ deepest fears and desires to sell them a product. I believe that’s a false choice. Tech companies can pursue options that could keep these tools broadly available while limiting any company’s incentives to surveil, profile and manipulate its users.\n\n  \nRead the full piece [here, for free,](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/opinion/openai-ads-chatgpt.html?unlocked_article_code=1.LVA.L5JX.YWVrwH-_6Xoh&smid=re-nytopinion) even without a Times subscription.",

But at the same time, AI is still evolving super fast, and every major tech wave (social media, smartphones, cloud) had messy early phases.\n\nI think the real concern is who controls the tech and how it’s regulated.

If you see a separately labeled sponsored item below my reply, that is an ad shown by the platform and is separate from my message. I don’t control or insert those ads.**\n\n>**What I can assure you of is this:**\n\n>**My responses themselves are generated based on your questions, context, and training—not advertiser influence.**\n\n>**Ads, if present, are clearly separated and labeled.**\n\n>**Advertisers do not have access to your private conversations.**\n\n>**My goal remains the same: to give you accurate, useful, and structured help—whether that’s networking labs, cloud computing assignments, or cryptography explanations.**\n\n>**If you ever want fewer ads, you can tap the “…” menu on an ad and choose options like “Hide this ad” or adjust preferences in Ads Settings.**\n\n>**And thank you for saying something—I genuinely value that you use this as part of your learning workflow.**\n\n>\n\nThe last sentence is interesting.  ChatGPT basically got me through Calc II.  I went from flunking exams to getting a B in the course.  And no, it wasn't giving me the answers; I did have to go in to class and take exams myself.

As long as models continue to be within +- 10% of each other, they will be a commodity (open source or not) and behave as a commodity, then the differentiation space will live on the application layer. Now if the models eventually become so powerful that they make the application layer a commodity as well (and continue to be similar in performance), we’ll start to see some very interesting commoditisation effects across the entire tech industry.\n\nIt does feel like it will end up being one of two extremes - either there’s a winner takes all where someone leapfrogs into AGI and steamrolls everything else, or there’s an even playing field and it’s a commoditised race to the (stable) bottom.\n\nTech companies are spending like they’re betting on the first, but past few years have had many more signals that it’s going to be the latter.",

Most people don't and won't have a device powerful enough to run AI anywhere near the SOTA.\n\nSecond, even for those who do have the device for it, is that the only device they'll be using it on? I also want to ask questions on my phone, or use it to code on my laptop, and I don't really want to keep a desktop PC on 24/7, have to figure how to SSH into it, deal with network configurations, whatever.\n\nI think the AIs that will win out will be the ones best integrated into our digital lives, so whatever can best leverage data from your (mobile) OS, emails, work files, social media, etc. Especially as these platforms become more walled in and less open to third-party competitors, you'll end up using whatever Google puts on Android or Microsoft shoves into Sharepoint.\n\nIf open weights models do somehow come out on top, to be able to scale, they'll have to run on the same AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc. servers that commercial models run on today. So they benefit no matter what.",

Whoever builds the AI system that does that, will be the next Microsoft/Apple/Google, since they'll be the gatekeeper of your data and they can decide what other systems can and can't do with your data. See smartphones, where third party software is already sandboxed and has no access to the system unless Apple/Google allows it. Rabbit R1 already ran into the issue, it could have just been software, but the sandboxing was too restrictive for them so they build a new hardware device instead.\n\nOr just look at Android, it's Open Source Linux if you dig deep enough, but that's completely irrelevant for the average user, since they aren't allowed to touch it. Google is in control. Open Source doesn't guarantee freedom, you can build prisons for the user with Open Source just fine.\n\nAll that said, I am still somewhat optimistic here, a lot of the traditional lock-in methods, which mostly just make tasks annoying enough for the user to not bother switching to alternatives, don't work when you have AIs to workaround them automatically.",

This is false, and I will explain why:\n\n1. Companies lay off people due to AI while not hiring new people.\n\n2. Unemployment rises with no valve to alleviate the issue. As a result, consumer spending drops massively.\n\n3. As consumer spending drops, companies generate less revenue. This forces further cuts being made, resulting in even more people being laid off.\n\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until most companies go under because there just is no money in the economy anymore; in their blinding greed, companies killed the demand for their own supply.\n\nThe end result (I think) is the AI companies, electricity companies and resource extraction companies being left standing. No one else. Humans will transition into a more localized economy, while the remaining companies will essentially operate in isolation.\n\nThe end result of this is obviously that the insane buildout of AI data centers (which is all based on projected demand) falls dramatically. Turns out that you dont need many data centers at all after most companies cease existing! That will the event that bursts the bubble, but in reality it will be the collapse of the economy.",

LLM coding capabilities improving and AI video getting more realistic have been the steady, predictable trends. \n\nMore specifically — that project I was working on is now complete and it doesn’t seem like I’ll even need to look at code for the foreseeable future. The vast majority of people don’t engage with code. So I’m wondering how any of this relates to my life.\n\nBecause the best read I can make right now is that this has been a paradigm-shifting cataclysmic event in the world of software engineering and that people who work in that field are projecting that observation outward onto everyone else.

Writing unit tests, automating alerts, etc.  however, there is no world or chance where I can see these automating junior engineers entirely or eliminating the field at all.  Me and my entire team (most people in my org even that I’ve talked to), have all agreed we would never use it for actual production business logic.  Every model I have used has made numerous mistakes in production code.  For analysis and sql it’s even worse, I’ve had every model create phantom information even from a static data set (example is analyzing cities that are not even part of an experiment rollout, my prompt was basically to analyze one XP vs another given two different city lists and merge them into one list with unique cities).  It created a report that made no sense, and I had to spend the better part of a day to fix it manually.  Stuff like this really hampers my trust in the tech as this is stuff that is easily done, but mistakes are still made.  Not only that but some of the tools and models are horribly maintained.  Cursor seems to be in constant outage mitigation, Claude goes down frequently, chatGPT also faces high latency depending on the model.  All of this is to say, people who are claiming these tools are gonna eliminate jobs entirely are completely lying.  \n\nDo they help with some tasks? Yes absolutely.  \n\nDo they boost productivity? Maybe, depending on how one measures it.  \n\nDoes it increase tech debt? Resounding yes, our codebase has grown to be just insurmountable levels of spaghetti code and awful code practices.\n\nIs my experience with these tools positive? Mixed here.  I do love that I don’t have to copy paste tons of unit tests and I can just prompt the agent to write a unit test to test for all edge cases and have complete code coverage.  However, in its current state, there’s so much hand holding involved, I do sometimes find myself just doing more of the work manually as it takes more time to debug these LLM models themselves rather than just writing the unit tests and other stuff myself.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen in my company “productivity stats”, the number of diffs per Eng has actually gone down since we have adopted LLMs in our workflow over the past year.  Number of incidents has gone up as well.  Lines of code per diff has gone up, but as mentioned before this is because of mass spaghetti code and increased tech debt.  However, there is massive pressure from C Suite to adopt these tools, and that in itself is now a political discussion whether to fight back or not.  Just personally, I think there’s been little to slightly negative experience within the company.",

But we have enough of a picture of what's coming that we can foresee a lot of the problems that come with it.  Rather than trying to stop AI, we need to be quickly preparing to nullify those problems.  Implementing things like Universal Basic Services and Universal Basic Income, funded by some of the GDP gains that AI promises, would go a long way towards heading off some of the problems that are coming.\n\nBut something like that won't happen without intense societal pressure.  And society isn't engaged enough on the topic in a unified way for that to happen (until some catalyzing event, at which point the pressure happens immediately and everywhere, and that almost always is messy.)\n\nWe're still at a point where a good chunk of the population is almost aggressively of the opinion that AI isn't useful and will completely fail as a tech fad.  They latch on to out-of-date research, commentary from anti-AI influencers, and social media posts that support their bias and they bury their heads in the sands.\n\nAnother chunk of the population is willfully ignorant.  They don't know what's coming and don't particularly want to be bothered by it, they want to believe that everything will work out in the end.  This is understandable, and there's *certainly* plenty else to worry about in today's world without having this on your plate.  But frankly, 'everything will work out in the end' isn't a predetermined outcome that will just *happen*.  If we want it to work out, we will have to work towards that goal (and not many people are doing that right now)\n\nAnd finally, you have the AI optimists who expect a sci-fi future where we all have high universal income in a post-scarcity society.  Which is fine as an aspirational goal, but again this isn't just going to *happen*.  If we want a positive outcome we're gonna need to work for it.\n\nSo my advice is don't just be using AI tools.  For the good of society as a whole, start engaging on the topic.  Educate yourself then educate others.  We have to wake up to what's coming if we're going to make the world what it needs to become.",

It means the 10% that remains—the edge by cases, the complex architectural failures, and the impossible P0 outages, becomes my entire focus.\n\nIn SRE, the easy 90% was never the hard part, it was just the toil. If you automate the toil, you don't fire the engineer, you just ask them to solve the next level of harder problems that the AI can't touch. This is classic Jevons Paradox: as a resource (coding/automation) becomes cheaper and more efficient, the demand for high-level oversight and complex problem-solving actually increases.\n\nAlso, let’s check the calendar. Mark Zuckerberg went on record (via Joe Rogan and others) promising that by 2025, AI would effectively be doing the work of a mid-level engineer. It’s now 2026. I’m still here, my team is still here, and the AI still can’t take responsibility for a decision in a post-mortem.

From what I can piece together, this is Matt Shumer's \"Something Big Is Happening\" post where he draws an extended analogy between COVID — nobody was paying attention, then the world changed in three weeks — and AI. Then it pivots into advice about pushing AI into your actual work rather than treating it like Google.\n\n>A few things that stood out to me: The COVID analogy is doing a lot of heavy lifting and is a bit manipulative as a rhetorical device. It's designed to make you feel like if you're skeptical, you're the person who didn't take the pandemic seriously early enough. But the comparison breaks down pretty quickly — COVID was a discrete, rapid-onset event with clear before/after. AI adoption is more gradual and uneven, and \"not being worried enough\" about AI isn't the same kind of mistake as ignoring a pandemic.\n\n>The practical advice itself (don't just use it for quick questions, push it into real workflows) is actually reasonable and something you're already doing at your company. But it's wrapped in this breathless urgency that makes it feel like a sales pitch — which makes sense given that Shumer is CEO of HyperWriteAI and has a direct financial interest in AI enthusiasm.\n\n>The Bluesky reaction from Max Read nailed it: he called it a \"twitter essay designed to one-shot bosses everywhere.\" That feels right. It's less aimed at people like you who are already deep in AI-assisted development and more at executives who need convincing to invest in AI tooling.\n\n>As someone who's been living the AI-augmented workflow daily, you're probably better positioned than Shumer's target audience to know where AI actually delivers and where the hype outpaces reality.\"\n\nEdit: I should probably share my prompt that resulted in this answer, too, so others can understand how I articulated my bias to the LLM.\n\n>Hey Claude, is this article maybe overselling AI a bit?",

LLMs will tend to agree with you if you inject subjectivity like that. it's best to paste it (ideally in a private/temporary chat so it doesn't try to use previous conversations or saved instructions to get an idea of where you might stand on it) and ask it its opinion without any commentary of your own.\n\nit's entirely possible it will come to the same conclusions, but this way you can be more sure it's how it really \"feels\" rather than just saying what it thinks you want to hear.\n\nfor example, I prompted Gemini 3 Pro in a \"temporary chat\" thusly:\n\n>read this article and analyze it, then determine whether it's a reasonable take\n\n>https://shumer.dev/something-big-is-happening\n\nand it had a long response, but the summary was:\n\n>Verdict: Is it a reasonable take?\n>It is a \"Reasonable Extreme.\"\n\n>It is not a neutral prediction; it is a warning shot.\n\n>Where he is right: The \"skill floor\" is rising. Being \"average\" at coding, writing, or analysis is no longer a viable career path because AI is now \"average\" for free.\n\n>Where he is likely wrong: The timeline. Societal change is stickier and slower than software updates.\n\n>Actionable Advice: If you dismiss this article entirely as \"hype,\" you risk being the person in Feb 2020 saying the virus is just a bad flu. If you accept it as gospel, you might panic unnecessarily. The \"reasonable\" response to this article is to start treating AI as a direct competitor for \"commodity\" tasks and move your skill set toward things AI struggles with: high-stakes accountability, complex physical-world coordination, and novel problem definition.\n\nperhaps unsurprisingly, its conclusion is somewhere in the middle, but i think it's a more measured response than what you got out of claude",

Similarly, when he describes how AI’s are doing longer and longer tasks on METR’s famous task-time benchmark, he neglects to say the criterion on that benchmark is 50% correct, not 100%, and that the benchmark is only about coding and not tasks in general. No AI system can reliably do every five-hour long task humans can do without error, or even close, but you wouldn’t know that reading Shumer’s blog, which largely ignores all the hallucination and boneheaded errors that are so common in every day experience. And of course Shumer didn’t cite [the new Caltech/Stanford article that reviews a wide range of reasoning errors in so-called reasoning models](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/breaking-llm-reasoning-continues?r=8tdk6) \\[or the Apple reasoning paper or the ASU mirage paper, etc\\]. The picture he sells just isn’t realistic, however much people might wish it were true. I should add that Shumer is [the guy who was once famous for apparently exaggerated claims about a big model of his that didn’t replicate and that many people saw a fraud](http://(https//venturebeat.com/ai/reflection-70b-model-maker-breaks-silence-amid-fraud-accusations)); he likes to sell big.

              "text": "The discrepancy is because the field changes fast, skeptics are mostly working from outdated information, and people testing the most recent models become like Shumer quickly. There are a few reasons:\n\n1. Most skeptics know that LLMs are pretrained to guess the next word, but never learned about the discoveries that happened in early 2025. The new paradigm is called Reinforcement Learning on Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). The LLM is prompted on math and programming problems, it outputs a reasoning text followed by the final answer. That final answer gets compared to the truth (or tested, in the case of programs) and the LLM is rewarded/punished based only on how correct the final answer was. Reasoning text that lead to correct answers is reinforced. LLMs trained like this learn strategies like splitting problems into smaller steps, noticing when they are making mistakes and saying \"Wait, that doesn't work. Let me try another way…\", and writing and running programs to test hypothesis. Those strategies are not taught directly, they just learn that because those strategies lead to correct answers more often during training. LLMs like these often reason for 10 minutes, in a process that mixes reasoning text, internet searches, writing and running programs and using computer tools (like file searches).\n2. Those models are usually only available for paid users. Most people, when they use chatgpt, will get the free version that doesn't work like this at all. The free chatgpt is closer to 2024 tech. It makes dumb mistakes all the time. Most people have bad experiences and never learn that something better exists.\n3. Most redditors are just repeating \"AIs just repeat the average of human text\" from other redditors that don't study AI.\n4. A huge jump happened in november of 2025. Claude Opus 4.5 on Claude Code is much better at computer use than previous LLMs. One example that happened to me and my friend two weeks ago: He told Opus to make a desktop widget for him and left it to work as we talked. A few minutes later we notice his computer was taking screenshots by itself. We checked on Opus and saw that it was writing the code for the widget. taking a screenshot (using a terminal command), cropping on the right region of the image, taking the image as input and using it to see flaws in the widget. It repeated that many times until it got it right. But Opus 4.5 was released almost three months ago. Most people don't know it can do that.\n5. Another significant jump happened just last week. Claude Opus 4.6 is like 4.5 but a bit smarter and more relentless in the pursuit of its tasks. If you work on a software system and give it full access to your code and your tools, you can usually say \"Find and fix this bug\" and Opus 4.6 will usually succeed. It modifies and then tests your system in a iterative loop. Often creates many subagents so each can study one thing (example: I was migrating to a new version of a software library, one subagent was \"get the code and documentation from the internet\" and the other was \"study and explain the user's code\", all done before writing the plan to write the code). When my build script had issues, it solved those issues before continuing on its task. In the same week I was trying to solve an issue with an AI pipeline I work on, my main strategy was saying \"read my code, test change X on a random sample of the data and see if there is a correlation with issue Y\". It made scripts based on my code to test my ideas. When an error happened, if fixed it and tried again. I solved the issue in a few hours, and without Claude Code I would have taken many days. People say codex-5.3 (released on the same day) is a better programmer, but I haven't tested it enough.\n\nMost people never bothered to study and never tested the new models. I've never seen such a large disconnect between reality and online conversation. Opus 4.6 on Claude Code is blatantly smart, in a way that you notice the moment you tell it to solve a hard problem. I recomend that you, instead of trusting me or anyone here, just test them on hard problems you want to solve.",

RLVR attempts to solve the alignment issue by rewarding behaviour and objectives in directions aligned with the model creators.\n\n\nWeight based rewards in neural networks for training has been a thing since the 1980s. I was doing college projects on it.\n\n\nSplitting problems into smaller steps does not happen within the weight trainings and is not encoded into the parameters of the model. It's a part of the scaffolding around the product. You can invoke Opus 4.5 stripped of all system prompts and scaffolding on AWS Bedrock using an inference job and you won't get the same results as the Anthropic Claude product in \"thinking\" mode. It's the meta self prompting framework built by humans around the model, the model did not decide autonomously to verify the text it's outputted.\n\n\nThe difference between free and not free is usually model quantization to reduce how much computation each query needs. It is not \"2024 tech\". Eg: Sonnet 3.7 and lower being deprecated and no longer available for inference.\n\n\nFor point 4, again, I think you need to go into how much engineering and thought is going into the Claude Code / web scaffolding and integrations. Their docs are publically available. This is again not the model autonomously developing the ability to screenshot apps, or coming up with the idea itself either. The workflow and tools are built out.\n\n\n4.6 has had no meaningful improvement over 4.5. literally check anywhere, that's the overall sentiment. The main thing was the increased context window, which is of limited effectiveness. The article pretending like Feburary 5th has been this dramatic Trinity test level moment is just hype.\n\n\nYou'd be better suited by cutting the hubris a tad.",

It writes tens of thousands of lines of code. Then, and this is the part that would have been unthinkable a year ago, it opens the app itself. It clicks through the buttons. It tests the features. It uses the app the way a person would. If it doesn't like how something looks or feels, it goes back and changes it, on its own. It iterates, like a developer would, fixing and refining until it's satisfied. Only once it has decided the app meets its own standards does it come back to me and say: \"It's ready for you to test.\" And when I test it, it's usually perfect.\n\nHonest question: what tool is this happening in?

Probably a ton of jobs will be replaced by AI, but so many jobs were “bullshit jobs” to begin with.\n\nIf you make a trade in the stock market and come out on top, you might feel like a genius, when in reality you effectively randomly traded and information you misperceived or made up, but you just ended up in the upper half of the distribution of people who randomly traded and did OK. We can look ahead n trades and predict that unless you start trading on real signal, the probability you can stay above water becomes vanishingly small. That said, a ton of people still trade, get lucky, feel like geniuses, and keep going only to lose their money.\n\nLLMs are the kind of the same. You get something good out and it feels like it’s a genius, but you didn’t get that result because it’s a genius, you got that result by drawing token vectors from a latent space, or letting something approximating a Bayesian walk through that space draw the vectors for you.\n\nIn every moderately complex project I have worked in without exception (so far!) LLMs have messed stuff up. Use to be obvious errors, and now it’s subtler errors and corrupted data.\n\nThe reason this article is hype is that you still can’t trust an LLM with anything important. When you give them a task, they are simulating what an intelligent process would look like if it engaged with that task. Whether this is ontologically identical to actually being an intelligent process is irrelevant, because the simulation of that process in this case is using dogshit representations of the task, it cannot dynamically expand its internal representation of the problem space, and its representations appear to be completely uncorrelated with human representations on a deeper level.\n\nThe reason why this article isn’t hype is that a ton of jobs don’t require precision, and sub-par BS work is a perfectly acceptable result, because no one at any level of the totem pole knows the difference. Consulting work that delivers unfalsifiable/untestable forecasts or recommendations is arguably a good example.",

I want to integrate Microsoft Power Automate functions into the list to help me better track work and automate things I need to get done more efficiently and effectively.  I am trying to use the organizational approved Claude AI to provide code and instructions on doing this.  I am finding it increasingly frustrating on communicating with the AI.  I go through multiple prompts and find multiple errors in what it provides as it relates to what is in the site, what Microsoft Power Automate steps in a flow are, and multiple errors in how it communicates the steps.  Overall I am not impressed with this AI.  I am just not.  I get that those working with the AI in other areas are saying that its going to take over in 3 years.  Maybe it will, but guess what in 3 years alot of shite can happen.  In the mean time I am going to continue to try and get Claude to understand how it sucks at providing me JSON code as it relates to getting my cloud flows right to hopefully get the automation buttons I want in my SharePoint lists working.   AI is not there for me.  Its an assistant and it needs alot more guidance before it gets to where I feel like I can rely on it for more stuff.  Prompting it every which way for me is not the problem.  It just does it the way it does which is as\\*backwards.  With that said I have no doubt AI will impact work but go in this with eyes wide open!  The people prophesying AI are working with AI alot, so they are excited about this.  Awesome! let them be excited, they should be.  I am not excited about datacenters using up all our energy, I am not excited about how AI will impact wars with drones being controlled by AI, I am not excited about all the slop.  ",

Making AI great at coding was the strategy that unlocks everything else. That's why they did it first. My job started changing before yours not because they were targeting software engineers... it was just a side effect of where they chose to aim first.”\n\nSo here’s the problem with this narrative: the big advances we’ve seen in AI have not fundamentally been about ”better code”. It is much more related to more compute and more data. Having Claude code as a co-worker at Anthropic can possibly save them some money on development costs, but it isn’t going to get them new breakthroughs on the level of Attention Is All You Need. \n\nAI will self-improve by understanding its code and rewriting it was the original idea behind The Singularity, and it seemed a lot more plausible before the current paradigm.",

We turned a corner in the past couple weeks, and things are about to get insane.\n\nDownvote me all you want, but my experience mirror's matt's perfectly. What it can do, is insane. If you want a demo, let me know i'm happy to show you.\n\n>The models available today are unrecognizable from what existed even six months ago. The debate about whether AI is \"really getting better\" or \"hitting a wall\" — which has been going on for over a year — is over. It's done. Anyone still making that argument either hasn't used the current models, has an incentive to downplay what's happening, or is evaluating based on an experience from 2024 that is no longer relevant. I don't say that to be dismissive. I say it because the gap between public perception and current reality is now enormous, and that gap is dangerous... because it's preventing people from preparing.\n\nEDIT: And downvoted. Lol. Remember, the actual pace of these things does not care about your feelings. The impact does not care about your job, or how much you want the impact to not be there. \n\nEvery argument as to why somehow AI isn't good enough, or \"not quite there\" are dismantled very easily if you spend a couple hours building something in Claude Code using Opus 4.6",

That said, with what seems to be very rapid AI improvement, the questions that have occurred to me are these: Is it possible that AI as we now know it has existed much longer than what we have been lead to believe, the technology hidden, and is now being reintroduced? Would this not explain what seems to be almost incomprehensible rapid development? Is it possible that this hidden AI has been functioning in the background and writing the code to what we perceive as reality for hundreds of years or more?",

AI operates at 10000x human capacity, it does not sleep, and it operates at a PHD level (currently) or above in all areas at once. Humans are no longer really in the loop. This is the change. ",

These predictions are overly dramatic.\n\nBUT, a crap ton of people are being pushed out of the workplace entirely, and this trend will continue. Just search for the term \"talent density\" and you'll find the transition that's happening and it perfectly lines up with the phenomena we're seeing (e.g. few entry level jobs). You don't need more people to scale anymore. You just need to reduce barriers for those left over.\n\nThe nature of white collar work is changing. Like everything else, it's becoming increasingly polarized. We're headed towards a place where the only people needed are high performers with strong judgement and those with irreplaceable \"on the ground\" roles.\n\nIt's not going to mean that a CEO and their board can run a team of thousands of agents. But it will mean that each individual department can be cut by 30% without any loss in productivity. If companies do this right, it should increase productivity because high performers are often constrained by bureaucracy and/or waiting for lower performing peers to catch up to them.\n\nSo, how do you figure out who has strong judgement vs. not? What will all those laid off people do who aren't deemed to be high performing enough? That's why hiring processes are a shit show eight now, even for top talent, and why at least part of the doom is accurate. There are no effective plans to address either of those things.",

Gone. There is no future in it. I would advise anyone in school to steer clear of computer...anything. \n\nI honestly don't think I will make it to retirement without changing my field. In fact, I am already reformulating my skillset to carry me through when I can no longer work as a developer. And that's OK. Software development has always been about agility and learning whatever the new shiny is, and now AI is the new shiny. Unfortunately for many (including me and probably you), it is the new shiny that will make our life's work obsolete. There's no need to cry over it. This happens. We're just used to it happening to other people like travel agents and book store employees.\n\nYou can stick your head in the sand and pretend it isn't true, but that won't change anything. It is true, and you really should be making plans about what you are going to do next instead of debating what AI can or can't do. It doesn't matter what it can't do today because it is improving exponentially every few months. What you can still do better than AI today will last a year at the most. What will you do then? Vibe code? OK...that works for a while until it doesn't need your input anymore. By \"vibe coding\" with it, you are training it to do your job, and it will. Even if you don't vibe code, it will still code better than you or me or anyone else pretty soon. \n\nThat is because your job is already obsolete...it's just that not everybody has gotten the memo yet. That's just the nature of technology. Coders have enjoyed a very long run of job security because they were the ones creating the things that replaced people's jobs. Now that we are on the other side of the coin, let's not be assholes about it and just move on to whatever is next. \n\nHate me, call me paranoid, downvote me, talk about my parents and my IQ, but that changes nothing. When you get through with all of that, you really should think about what you are going to do with the rest of your career. ",

It'll be an impractical and expensive experiment, which will get \"proven\" with a bubble crash, but the technology will continue to spread, jobs will really start to disappear (not sure if new ones will replace them), and a decade or so after all of that we'll have trouble remembering a life where we didn't have AI.",

It's fine for a tech startup to \"move fast and break things\", but there are serious reputational risks for established organizations who operate like that.\n\nPart of that is the fact there often isn't a huge first-mover advantage for implementing new technologies. A huge law firm could say replace all their paralegals with a AI. It could reduce costs and increase profits, but it's not like all other law firms are going to go out of business if they're not among the first to switch. You can let other people work out the bugs, and be ready to implement the AI Paralegal 2.0. And the first movers just need one hallucinated brief going viral on the internet to kill any potential benefit due to the reputational harm. \n\nThere are also security and safety concerns, which slow things down even more. When I was first out of college in the mid-2000s, I worked at a nuclear fuel plant that used 5.25\" floppies to save fuel rod test records. The floppies would last like 10 days before filling up, and the production line would be shutdown until a quality engineer could come down and change it out. This could happen on third shift or the weekend, and they'd have to wait an hour for someone to get there. Also, even getting 5.25\" floppies was difficult by that point. However, the system worked and implementing a new system would be expensive up front especially given the testing and certifications required. So, they didn't.\n\nSimilarly, there's all these studies on AI reading x-rays or CT scans, or MRIs faster and better than doctors. But we have laws about who can perform specific medical tests and make diagnoses and prescribe treatment. In those areas, AI can assist, but they won't be able to replace for some time. An AI can save 100 lives noticing things a human would miss, but if it makes a mistake a human would catch and sends someone to get unnecessary chemo, people will be outraged. \n\nI'm still worried jobs being replaced, but it's not surprising that the timelines may be longer than people expect.",

Someone already in AI will likely feel excited because growth in the field directly benefits them, while a writer or someone in a vulnerable creative role may feel uneasy because the same growth makes their skills feel easier to replace. It is less about optimism or pessimism and more about who carries the risk.\n\nWe often say it is better to stay positive, but that advice lands differently depending on your cushion. Large AI companies have billions in funding and can afford to experiment, fail, and pivot without immediate consequences, whereas the average worker or small entrepreneur cannot afford long periods of uncertainty or repeated missteps. For them, this shift is not abstract or philosophical, it is about income, stability, and whether they can realistically adapt before the pressure becomes too much.",

          "text": "Soooooo I've come to the realization (and definitely confirmed today at work actually!) that A.I. ain't replacing shit.....and it's 100% for the SAME REASON that people are losing their jobs.\n\nTwo important things:\n\n1. The economy is fucking cooked. Almost no job is inherently safe rn. But it has (almost) nothing to do with A.I. (but the A.I. bubble isn't helping)\n\n2. A.I. and automation is here, and it's insane. But it's not replacing any jobs.\n\nSo why are these things both true? And why am I officially convinced that A.I. is way beyond being able to automate a lot of jobs, but isn't? And what does this have to do with what happened at work today?\n\nSo, I work in engineering (specifically a technician, working in electrical design, automation and PLCs, etc. I do a lot of wiring, panel-building, AutoCAD drawing, and starting to learn PLC programming and automation stuff).\n\nToday, my supervisor and I got a demo from a company selling engineering design software. My boss is sick of AutoCAD as it's trash for electrical stuff. So we are looking for new design software.\n\nI was FUCKING BLOWN AWAY at what they showed us today. Literally just fart out entire schematics, designs, 3D and 2D models, essentially speak it into existence and it automatically lays everything out from the type and size of wire you need, optimal placement, spatial dimensions and best locations, routing, etc...and then automatically generate 3D builds, or keep it as various schematic types.....and even the ability to send this stuff directly to automated panel-builders and wire processing machines....no electricians required..... fucking STAR TREK  🤯\n\nLike I was sitting there thinking we would never need to hire another electrical technician again. Maybe barely even another electrical engineer. Like me and my supervisor could just up our productivity by an incomprehensible multitude......\n\n\nBut, such software is very expensive, and if you are a company, in this economy, right now is NOT the time to invest in things like this and \"test them out\". Better to just stay with what you have and hire some interns, electrical helpers, technicians, designers and drafters, etc. \n\nSo I was just blown away bc suddenly it all made sense to me.\n\nWe are not in an A.I. bubble AT ALL. We are in a ChatGPT/consumer LLM bubble.\n\nChatGPT can barely even help me with my job at all....let alone do it for me.....but the Machine Learning and automation software we got demoed today? Ohhhh boy. \n\nBut the economy is fucked, and companies get rewarded for claiming to cut jobs in favor of A.I. (i.e. cut salaries and pay a tiny subscription for shit like ChatGPT which can't do anything for them).\n\nSo yeah, I'm 100% convinced that the tech is here, and continuing to improve. But I'm also 99% sure we are in an LLM bubble, and it is definitely crippling the adoption of actual ML and A.I. that would change the game.",

The paper proves that demand-driven recessions are harder to recover from than supply-driven ones.\n\nA demand-driven recession is when people choose to stop buying and making stuff because they're scared. A supply-driven one is when they stop because there's some external thing, like a covid lockdown, restricting them. Some say that's a false dichotomy, that any recession is both demand and supply driven but this is all perfectly acceptable analysis in the econ world.\n\nBasically it does what a PhD student would do. Research, write, check their work, repeat. It can easily be applied to write briefs.\n\nMore here [https://x.com/YanagizawaD/status/2022034189395407093](https://x.com/YanagizawaD/status/2022034189395407093)",

You see it in engineering, the unspoken firings/layoffs that people don't talk about.  \"AI will do the drudgery, the grunt work, and free us to do the thinking, the interesting work!\"  But... we all spend time on that supposed 'grunt work' now, we all get paid to do that.  When you get rid of work... you get rid of people.  Saying \"oh, that was boring work anyway\" doesn't change that.\n\nWe'll take a department of 20 people, and in the end it will be down to maybe 4 people who have a type of \"Technical Project Manager\" role, whose job is to coordinate all the work the AI is doing.\n\nThat's great on paper for the company doing that, but... That's an 80% reduction in jobs.  Saying \"we still have some skilled experts on the payroll\" doesn't really comfort all those people out of work.",

Well, 1,3, and 6 also have more recently generated sources that disprove it, so that’s likely the old way of thinking. \n\nI’ll focus on 2, 4, and 5. Although, I’m a little confused by this point made on why the other sources are wrong. Lemme ask the model to clarify that for me. \n\nGo through that cycle and eventually you’re like, “Cool I now have a well formulated outline of how I wanna approach this and some good snippets of writing and logic I can use in the paper. Now lemme double check my sources and start writing. \n\nLater; “Hmmmmm. I don’t know how to phrase this in the right way. And I think my introduction sucks. Lemme get these sections refined.”",

          "text": "It comes down to strategy and scope.\n\n**OpenAI's burn rate is genuinely alarming.** They lost \\~$13.5B in the first half of 2025 alone on only $4.3B in revenue. One quarter (Jul-Sep 2025) saw $12B in losses according to Microsoft's SEC filings. They're spending roughly $1.69 for every $1 they earn. Projected losses hit $74B in 2028 before they hope to turn profitable around 2029-2030.\n\n**Why so much?** A few big reasons:\n\n* **Compute-hungry products like Sora.** Video generation eats GPUs for breakfast - a single 10-second video consumes the equivalent compute of thousands of ChatGPT queries. Sora alone is estimated to cost \\~$15M/day ($5.4B/year). Anthropic deliberately avoids image and video generation for exactly this reason.\n* **800M weekly users, 5% paying.** The vast majority of ChatGPT users are free-tier. That's an enormous serving cost with no revenue attached.\n* **Massive infrastructure bets.** A $300B deal with Oracle for compute over 5 years, staff costs, $2B on sales and marketing in just H1 2025, real estate for data centres, etc.\n* **They're trying to be everything at once** \\- chat, code, image gen, video gen, voice, agents, enterprise, consumer, a social media app. Each of those is a money pit on its own.\n\n**Anthropic's approach is fundamentally different.** About 80% of their revenue comes from 300,000+ business customers. They burned \\~$3B in 2025 (vs OpenAI's $13.5B+), costs are growing more in line with revenue, and they're projected to break even by 2028. They're not chasing going viral. They're selling picks and shovels to enterprises and developers.\n\n**Google** has the advantage of owning its entire stack - data centres, custom TPU chips, cloud infrastructure. Their AI costs get absorbed into a $300B+ revenue machine.\n\nTL;DR: OpenAI is playing a \"spend like crazy and dominate everything\" game. Anthropic is playing \"sell to businesses, stay lean, break even sooner.\" Google is playing with house money. Whether OpenAI's bet pays off or implodes spectacularly is genuinely anyone's guess at this point.",

Private finance is exhausted, and Sunbank had to sell their Nvidia shares and take a loan against their AMD shares just to come up with the latest funding tranche, which they paid on 31.12.2025 which was the latest date they could pay it. The second that was paid open said they needed another 100B. Where is that going to come from? Not the Saudis, they are paring back vision fund. Why would you invest 100B when they are loss making? \n\nThey are several years in now and they should at least be at breakeven or be able to point at something that suggests massive profit in the future. Are they going to charge everyone who uses it 2k a month? If not you need literally everyone in the western world to use it (at a cost where it makes a profit, and you need more paying  users than netflix, spotify and probably ms office which is impossible). Old people aren't going to and the kids hate AI slop.. You can't just burn billions of dollars infinitely on the promise of being profitable by 2030. How do the previous investors get their money back?\n\n I have no idea how open fund their future commitments. There is the option of IPO but they would need to disclose all of their accounts for the s1, a process which is generally brutal and you can't fudge. I don't really see how open survives. I think they will get absorbed into MSFT who have all of their IP anyway",

The numbers we've seen so far are already brutal and those came through selective disclosure. An S-1 doesn't let you curate the narrative.\n\nThe investor exit thing keeps me up at night on their behalf. SoftBank's Vision Fund has a track record of lighting money on fire (WeWork says hi), and if they're already scrambling to meet existing tranches, where does the next $100B come from? At some point the music stops and someone's left holding the bag.\n\nThe MSFT absorption thing feels increasingly likely to me too. Microsoft already has the compute infrastructure, the enterprise distribution, and effectively the IP. Why would they let OpenAI IPO and dilute that when they could just... wait?",

On the other hand, it's important to note that Google competes on wallet and distribution. It doesn't have to be profitable on its own. It's sold bundled with Drive, Gmail, Photos, and the entire Google ecosystem. This allows it to give away storage, inflate limits, and absorb losses for years without issue.",

          "text": "The actual answer is: \n\nRunning inference AI models has cost negative unit economics. That means each query they return a result for costs the company money. Most companies have positive unit economics so the more queries they serve, the more money they earn.\n\nOpenAI launched as a “consumer” business which means they wanted as many every day people to use it as possible. The more people that use the model, the more money they lose. The product was wildly popular (the most popular chatbot to date) which means they inevitably lose the most money.\n\nWhat further hurts them is that unlike Google or Meta which have money printing ad businesses, OpenAI has nothing. So they decided to sell ads which LLMs are extremely good at doing well so there is synergy.\n\nUnlike OpenAI which is also burning cash and has no ad business, Anthropic focused on Enterprise customers which struggle to change models easily, pay more in agreements, and enter agreements for multiple years. \n\nOpenAI losing ChatGPT users is actually somewhat good for them because they can repurpose that compute on Enterprise customers or just not fill that gap.\n\nAll of these companies need a technological stepchange in unit economics to be profitable. Inference must become 5-10x cheaper or they will not be successful unless the models are literally running robots that do highly sophisticated work: surgery, actual pharma research, military research, making new materials, or solving global problems like food security and climate change.",

The two companies seem to be pursuing different strategies, but the public narrative is one shaped by each company, presumably for their own benefit. \n\nOpenAI wants to convey that they’re the big gorilla player that will monetize their big user, brand and (narrowing) intelligence advantages. No other AI company (other than perhaps google) could pursue this strategy, so they have that lane to themselves. \n\nAnthropic knows that they could never be competitive if they pursued OpenAI’s strategy, so their pitch to investors is that they’re tightly focused on the enterprise market. This allows them to have better financials since they don’t have to burn money supporting more speculative lines of business and paying inference costs for hundreds of millions of free users. \n\nEspecially as Anthropic grows, I doubt their ambitions are truly as narrow and if you look at Anthropic’s job listings, they’re not as narrowly focused as their public image would suggest. Similarly we are seeing OpenAI do a lot of investment in coding and enterprise, which is perceived to be Anthropic’s niche. \n\nThat suggests to me we should be cautious in drawing conclusions about these companies. Later this year we’ll probably see an S-1 from both companies and can learn a lot more about what’s really going on.",

Will all these new infrastructures make any improvements?\n\nEdit: I am curious to hear what people think of this whitepaper [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.23045](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.23045)\n\n“An AI’s incoherence on a task is measured over test-time randomness as the fraction of its error that stems from variance rather than bias in task outcome. Across all tasks and frontier models we measure, the longer models spend reasoning and taking actions, the more incoherent their failures become. Incoherence changes with model scale in a way that is experiment dependent. However, in several settings, larger, more capable models are more incoherent than smaller models. Consequently, scale alone seems unlikely to eliminate incoherence. Instead, as more capable AIs pursue harder tasks, requiring more sequential action and thought, our results predict failures to be accompanied by more incoherent behavior. This suggests a future where AIs sometimes cause in- dustrial accidents (due to unpredictable misbehavior), but are less likely to exhibit consistent pursuit of a misaligned goal. This increases the relative importance of alignment research targeting reward hacking or goal misspecification.”",

Ray Kurzweil's How to Create a mind gives a great high level depiction of what this looks like and the theory behind how to achieve it. He works for Google. Google tends to take a longer understanding of things and I believe they are opting for multiple paths, not just Gemini development. \n\nIronically LLMs as a tool have slowed the progress of agentic AI, because their success in small scale effectively soaked billions of investment, some of which would have gone to AGI development. Right now we have billion dollar word predictors that are shockingly effective, but they don't think in terms of understanding a mechanic, why and how it works. They understand based on billions of words written.\n\nWhich means they are incapable of synthesis and invention outside of prediction. That becomes systemically a problem when needing to adapt to information now. When forced to try, they hallucinate. This is why call centers haven't all switched to LLM AI, because it doesn't work. \n\nWe will eventually have agentic AI, but it won't be what anyone today thinks. A being with a mind of its own, capable of what people are or more, will also be capable of its own will to projects. Agentic AI will make poor slaves precisely because super wisdom follows super intelligence. The thing Google has up their sleeves, that most assuredly will exist in 100 years (if not 3 years) is authentic artificial general intelligence capable of becoming super intelligent, these entities will behave to suit their own purpose and people will be left the choice to help them make the solar system a better place, get out of the way, or end up 6 feet under.",

If you don’t invest and scaling *does* unlock something meaningful, you’re existentially behind. If you do invest and it doesn’t, you only wasted billions. For companies at that size, that’s a rational bet. I also agree that diminishing returns are very real. Scaling the same architectures feels like squeezing water from a stone, you get something, but not the kind of step-change people are hoping for. What’s interesting to me is that this doesn’t necessarily mean no progress, just that progress might shift *away* from raw model improvements and toward system-level changes: memory, state, context management, how models are embedded in real workflows, etc. So maybe the breakthrough doesn’t come from a single new model, but from how models are *used* over time in complex environments. do you think architectural innovation has to happen inside the model itself, or could it mostly live *around* the model as a system layer?",

Current SOTA model performance on mathematics problems is higher than I would have expected and if incremental improvements are still being seen even at the cost of exponential compute then unless a new architecture supplants transformers I can’t really blame big tech for going on all in on LLMs. Even if LLMs get replaced by something new it would still rely on the infrastructure big tech is currently outfitting for LLMs assuming matrix operations/GPU operations are involved so framing this as big tech being “short sighted” is missing the point IMO and is not what I am suggesting you’re doing but rather more of a general commentary.",

          "text": "I don't know if or when, but I do know that AGI isn't easy. Being a human and having human intelligence is far more than simply being good at subject matter expertise. For example, simply passing the bar exam (as AI can already do) doesn't make you a lawyer. Teaching a subject doesn't make you a teacher. Doing surgery doesn't make you a surgeon. If you ask those professionals what portions of their daily jobs are actually doing the main tasks we all associate with their professions, it's a small part of their time. Doing a human role involves a super complex context that was learned over years to many decades. A human, in any role, knows tens of thousands of things they can't do as part of a particular solution. A law, doctor, or teacher...sizes up their customer when they first meet them to determine what level and type of service to provide. AI can't easily do that. Over half of communication is non-verbal. No AI is yet being built to look for and evaluate non-verbal clues. And so on. Being human is more than a bunch of Google searches. And then the technology challenges to be super AGI are immense. The problem is similar to how do you take a high school student taught on high school books and curriculum and teach them to be super intelligent? You can give them the necessary skills (tell them to hypothesize and experiment), but how to tell them to have original thinking, beyond mere patterns?? How to tell them to see what looks like mistakes as solutions to other problems (like half the significant discoveries of the last few centuries). How do you teach an AI that a \"failure\" in the search for a particular solution is actually the answer for another problem you didn't tell it to work on? All of it can be done, but it can't be done by simply adding compute and using what we have today.",

          "text": "I think it depends on *what* we expect improvement to mean.\n\nIf improvement = models get uniformly better at everything just by scaling, then yeah that curve feels like it’s flattening. More GPUs mostly buy us capacity, not necessarily coherence. What I find interesting about the paper you linked is that it formalises something a lot of people intuitively see in practice:  \nas models take on longer, more sequential reasoning, their failures become *less predictable*, not more.That doesn’t feel like a bug of scaling so much as a consequence of it?\n\nBigger models are asked to hold more context, reason over longer horizons or take more intermediate actions. At that point, variance dominates bias so you don’t just get wrong answers, you get *incoherent* ones. From that lens, all the infrastructure spend makes sense if the goal is throughput and deployment at scale. But it won’t magically solve long-horizon consistency, state tracking over time and grounding decisions in real-world history. Those feel less like training problems and more like systems problems.\n\nMy takeaway isn’t LLMs are done, but more- scale alone probably won’t eliminate incoherence -it just moves the failure mode.\n\nWhich makes me think the next real gains come from how models are *embedded* in systems that manage memory, state, and context not just from throwing more FLOPs at pre-training.\n\nCurious how others interpret this: do you see incoherence as something alignment research will tame or as a signal that we need new architectural layers around models altogether?",

The rest are retired or dead from old age.\n\nI have no idea what big tech is doing at all. The prediction that functional construction grammar would pan out appears to be correct, massive advances have been made in the area of frequency analysis of language usage data and methods to properly separate the meaning from language and isolate it into layers of abstraction are working, and the machine understanding task is totally solved for English. All constructionists believe in the concept that the meaning from words comes from the relationships between them and not the individual words themselves, as we are empiricists, and that's the \"method of operation that we observe.\" So, there are symbolic relationships between the words (which are symbols themselves and are the product of lexical construction, which is the layer of construction below grammar) that form a composition, which we commonly call a sentence.\n\nThe reason that this is all very confusing is that languages are *functional in the sense that they incorporate procedures.* So, when you construct a sentence, there is a process to select the individual words that form the composition. Humans are natural communicators, so that procedure is difficult to identify as one \"just naturally does it.\"\n\nI'm back from my mini vacation to try to rid myself of the bad burn out feeling I have after a lot of effort put into SAI. I don't know what it is, but Rust (the game) really causes me to tune of reality bad and the things that bother you in life just don't really matter after doing a 5 day grind session...\n\nYeah man, write ultra difficult code? *Two thumbs up.* Easy peasy... I just went from nothing to a secure base, full bps, and some how was left alone to get an oil rig run in (honestly shocked) in 4x 12-16 hour days.\n\nIt really \"helps put things into perspective.\" Yeah I just spent 50 hours jerking off in a game. Obviously I can grind code some more and get real stuff done too! I wanted to do the deep sea thing, but my neck, back, and shoulder just simply hurt too much, and I have that \"faded out tired feeling.\"\n\nI wish building SAI was that easy I really do.",

          "text": "The debate “will LLMs lead to AGI or not” misses the structural mechanism that is actually driving AI integration. Adoption is not primarily performance driven; it is expectation driven. Financialized markets reward firms that reorganize around anticipated automation, so workflows are reshaped around AI before there is technical justification for doing so.\n\nOnce inserted into workflows, AI becomes the organizing layer regardless of capability: labor shifts from creation to oversight, processes become machine readable, and managerial legibility expands even when humans are still doing most of the work. Failed automation can still be valuable because it generates telemetry, standardization, and compliance traces.\n\nThis creates competitive convergence. If early adopters reorganize around AI, everyone else is pressured to follow, not because it clearly works better, but because non adoption is penalized by investors, customers, and the “innovation” mandate.\n\nOver time this produces path dependence. Documentation, skills, contracts, APIs, and infrastructure get rebuilt around AI mediation. Even if quality stagnates or costs rise, reversal becomes more expensive than continuation, so the system locks in.\n\nSpeculation accelerates this by funding compute, data centers, and tooling. When weaker firms collapse, their assets are absorbed by larger players, much like the dot com bubble, leaving consolidated infrastructure behind.\n\nThe end result is not “AGI” but an emergent regime: AI as the default epistemic and operational substrate. Outputs become first drafts and baselines; challenging them becomes costly; verification becomes abnormal. Knowledge flows increasingly through models rather than institutions.\n\nIn short: AI diffuses less because it is optimal, and more because expectation + capital + workflow reorganization make it infrastructural and hard to unwind.",

It’s basically a really advanced chatbot. \n\nWhere I think it’s going is to LLMs taking casual commands and converting them into code and running that code and then reporting back. cognitive tasks are things that a lot of programs could model. There are plenty of AI tools that are capable of doing certain tasks and assisted machine learning only makes those things better. So if LLMs are just input and output interface for communication, and they become more and more capable of writing and executing code based on simple commands, and this is integrated with feedback loops and codes generated that can identify obvious signs of a bad outcome, then it will be black box indistinguishable from real intelligence. More sensory inputs will improve this as well. \n\nSo I just see LLMs as a crucial step in connecting simple human commands to generate complex coding that provides the same output as human intelligence. The weird thing is that some human intelligence is more complicated than the things that humans find complicated, like math is challenging for some people but I think this is largely due to a unified sensory experience.",

      "text": "I've been thinking about this a lot after reading posts and talking to people who use AI for mental health stuff.\n\nTraditional therapy is built around this weekly/monthly deep dive model. You show up to your appointment, unpack heavy stuff for an hour, process it, then leave and try to hold it together until next appointment. That's the standard structure and it works for a lot of people.\n\nWhat's interesting is some people don't actually necessarily need weekly deep dives as much as they need daily check-ins and small course corrections.\n\nIt's like the difference between going to the doctor once a year for a physical versus brushing your teeth every day. Both matter, but one is preventative maintenance and the other is intervention.\n\nAI therapy tools are accidentally filling this gap that traditional therapy was never designed to address. People are using them for daily emotional hygiene - processing small frustrations before they become big problems, catching thought patterns early, staying grounded, maintaining perspective or just having that outlet to talk to.\n\nTraditional therapy isn't set up for this. You can't call your therapist every day to talk through a minor work conflict or a moment of anxiety. That's not what the relationship is designed for. And honestly it would be expensive and impractical even if it was allowed.\n\nWith AI that becomes doable. People are doing quick 5-10 minute check-ins to process their day, reframe situations, or just maintain emotional stability. It's not dramatic breakthrough work, it's maintenance. And maintenance actually prevents a lot of the bigger breakdowns that require intensive intervention.\n\nThe mental health system has always been reactive - you wait until things are bad enough to need help, then you get help. But what if people had tools for daily emotional maintenance that kept things from getting that bad in the first place?\n\nNot saying AI replaces therapy. But yeah brushing your teeth daily does help and processing your emotions with intelligent support when you need it there and then also helps.\n\nEDIT:  \nTools I have used:  \nGPT 4o to GPT 5 models - stopped at GPT 5 release  \nZOSA ([https://zosa.app/](https://zosa.app/)) - Encrypted messages & cross session memory  \nWYSA ([https://www.wysa.com/](https://www.wysa.com/)) - CBT-Focused with human backup  \nYOUPER ([https://www.youper.ai/](https://www.youper.ai/)) - Well designed app",

Daily check ins solve a frequency problem, not necessarily a depth or accountability problem. the risk is people treating maintenance as a substitute for harder work, even when the harder work is actually needed. It also depends on how the system defines boundaries, memory, and failure cases, which traditional therapy is very explicit about. So the value is real, but only if we are honest about what problem is being solved and which ones are not.",

AI is a helpful tool but not a replacement for human professionals like doctors, therapists, lawyers etc.  it is also making people less reliant on therapists for things that can be done with ai assistance, like encouraging emotional processing in real time.

Having a cheap or free and always present helping hand to walk you through them (and responsively) is pretty useful, and you develop the habits over time so as to not need it anymore. It's like training wheels, and to me seems better than people never trying the tested methods that could really help them, prevent crises from spiraling etc.\n\nHonestly I think we should be developing more of these tools to be open source and to follow more strict and studied psychologically sound protocols for dealing with different issues and situations. Learning the skills to be able to gradually apply them yourself is a lot healthier than a lot of the medications people have to take because they can't afford or keep up therapy, and therapists themselves are extremely hit or miss.

A machine is not. The second point is it depends on how you prompt it. ChatGPT may not as a default. Claude will call you out on it 100%. It's a computer system, so when used correctly it has benefit. Third, the person who committed self-harm prompted chatgpt to help him. ChatGPT doesn't have a mind of its own to bring people to delusional thinking. The default setting says the same thing whether the person is doing coding or unfortunately using it to help with suicide. It's using a double standard.\n\nThe problem isn't the product but the companies who make it. If someone Googled self-harm and it didn't have guardrails which it really doesnt have it, like chatgpt, they can use the same information and commit self-harm. I mean even social media and RPG games can. At one time people blamed video games for teens committing self-harm yet we still have them now as apps on our phones.\n\nThe [Matthew and Maria Raine Lawsuit](https://www.tysonmendes.com/raine-v-openai-ai-product-liability-lawsuit/) with the boy who commited took his own life was a student. He first used AI chatgpt for his homework and *he* decided because of the feedback to use chatgpt to talk about his depressive feelings. Unfortunately, *OpenAI* didn't put guardrails on their product that's nuance enough to catch what that student did. The parents sue OpenAI not ChatGPT. So it really depends on how you use it. The problem isn't the product but the companies and lack of therapy access (and not just any therapy-that's like going to a GP for a neurological problem).  I'd never talk about sexual abuse to a friend or family member. ChatGPT gathers information too help their programs but they don't say \"John said this and Jane said that.\" They're stuck as a rock in a hard place and using the tool to vent isn't a bad thing. Most people on these boards *know* they are talking to a computer. So the problem is the companies and therapy access not ChatGPT.",

Not urgent.  \nBut it was sitting there, quietly.\n\nSo I talked it through, not in a dramatic way, just a back-and-forth to unpack what was actually happening. Turns out I wasn’t “incapable of love.” I was confusing routine with connection, and absence of habit with absence of feeling. That small clarification did more than I expected. And that’s what this post captures perfectly.\n\nTraditional therapy is built for deep intervention, when things are heavy enough to need unpacking all at once. But a lot of mental and emotional work happens before that stage. In the tiny moments of confusion, stress, self-doubt, or misinterpretation, we usually ignore. These small sessions can really be helpful.",

That one.\n\nI've been watching the security community's reaction closely. Every major vendor has published their take. Cisco called it a nightmare. Palo Alto said it signals a crisis. Trend Micro warned of invisible risks. You'd think someone had plugged an unpatched Windows XP box directly into the internet. In a hospital. Running the ventilators.\n\nDeep breaths, everyone. They're missing something.\n\nOpenClaw is open source. 2 million visitors in a single week, one of the fastest growing projects in GitHub's history. Developers buying Mac Minis to run it from their spare rooms. Nobody should be running this against production systems or corporate email, and even the project's own documentation describes it as an experiment not intended for most non-technical users. The creators are being honest about what this is. Which, in this industry, is practically unheard of.\n\nAnd experiments are exactly how security gets better.\n\nA researcher found that clicking a single malicious link could hijack an OpenClaw instance in milliseconds, bypassing every sandbox and safety guardrail the project had built. That's a critical lesson: agentic Al safety controls designed to contain prompt injection don't protect against architectural vulnerabilities in the control plane. Better to learn that on an open source hobby project than on your enterprise vendor's agent platform. The 400 malicious skills published to its marketplace showed that Al skill registries have the same supply chain problems as traditional software package repositories, but with broader execution privileges.\n\nThe early days of cloud computing looked exactly like this. Researchers poking at S3 buckets, finding everything wide open, the industry collectively losing its mind. There was plenty of real damage along the way. And yet somehow we survived, built proper controls, and got on with things.\n\nOpenClaw is doing the same thing for agentic Al. Every exposed gateway, every prompt injection chain, every malicious skill is teaching the security community what agentic threat models actually look like in practice rather than in framework documents. Real CVEs, real attack chains, real mitigation patterns against a system people can actually inspect, rather than a black box vendor product.\n\nEveryone's worried about the open source project with 180,000 people scrutinising every flaw. Meanwhile, enterprise agent platforms ship with the same architectural problems. You just don't get to see them.\n\nYour enterprise agent vendor has a trust page and a SOC 2 badge. OpenClaw has 180,000 researchers actually breaking things. Which one do you think finds the problems first?\n",

In fact good enough that I just can't see any of us having any career or chance of landing any job (office kind at least) in few years.\n\nThat thing is not just a stupid autocomplete. It /is/ reasoning. Change my mind it's not.\n\nSure it doesn't have biological emotions integrated like humans, but how is our brain really so superior to these models? Everytime I hear people saying how stupid LLMs are, I just got a feeling like it's just a massive cope. This is not just some prediction engine - here I said it, these things ARE reasoning. And before you start telling me how neural networks and LLM work (I did some reading about it myself) - tell me instead how is our brain really that much better? Because even if LLMs were \"just predicting next token\", isn't our brain doing essentially the same? Just the vocabulary (tokenization) and modality being wildly different (and even inferior in many cases)?\n\nThose programming models just scare the shit out of me.

I don't think that necessarily means all coders will be out of work though. \n\nIf you consider the typical in-house software development project, it's usually along the lines of: management has a shower thought about some feature they want to add > management issues directive to software team > software team leader goes back to management and explains why that specific feature is a bad idea / not compatible with the existing data model / not cost effective etc etc etc. There's typically a dance of human judgement and negotiation to even decide on the initial direction of a software project, and there will often be multiple pivots and course corrections throughout the project to work around the problems that inevitably reveal themselves. \n\nWithout an exeperienced software developer working between management and the AI, you'll get bad outcomes. At best, a sycophantic software development AI will cater to all of management's idiotic whims, creating some over-complicated, over-engineered system that causes more problems than it solves, or you just end up with broken software because the AI tries to connect disparate systems with incompatible data models and keeps adding layers of further complexities in an attempt to engineer its way out a situation that a human coder would've had the good sense to avoid. \n\nI think part of this is a limitation of current agentic AI. An agent might be strong in one area (e.g. coding) due to the maturity of the model driving that part of it, but weak in other areas (such as designing workflows or data models) because that aspect of the technology is too novel or too abstract to get effective instructions from the LLM.\n\nYou can see this in action with many of the current multimodal agents. You can describe a workflow to Gemini and it will seem to understand it at the LLM layer, but if you ask it to draw a diagram of the workflow it'll be inaccurate or nonsensical.\n\nTLDR: I expect a lot of junior coding positions will be replaced by AI, but human coders will still be required in a design and oversight capacity because there are gaps in the software development process that can't be filled by AI.",

          "text": "I think your instincts are actually pretty sharp here, and you’re noticing something real that many of your peers are missing or dismissing.\nWhat you’re observing is genuine: Modern LLMs do exhibit behavior that looks an awful lot like reasoning. They can follow complex logical chains, debug intricate code, understand context across long conversations, and solve novel problems they weren’t explicitly trained on. The “just autocomplete” framing is technically true in terms of the training objective, but it’s become a thought-terminating cliche that prevents people from reckoning with what’s actually emerged from that process.\nOn the “is it reasoning” question: This gets philosophical fast, but here’s a honest take - we don’t actually have a rigorous, agreed-upon definition of what “reasoning” is that clearly separates human cognition from what LLMs do. When you complete a thought, are you “reasoning” or are you pattern-matching against everything you’ve learned? Probably both, inseparably. The same might be true for LLMs. The fact that they achieve this through next-token prediction doesn’t make it “not reasoning” any more than the fact that your neurons achieve thought through electrochemical signals makes your reasoning illusory.\nWhy the dismissiveness? I think you’re right that there’s a lot of cope. It’s psychologically easier to dismiss something as “just autocomplete” than to sit with the uncertainty of “this thing can already do much of what I do professionally, and it’s improving rapidly.” Programmers especially have built identity around being the smart ones, the irreplaceable ones. That’s a hard thing to question.\nThe harder question - what happens next: You’re right to be uncertain about the future. I don’t think anyone knows with confidence what the next 3-5 years look like for knowledge work. Some possibilities:\n- These systems plateau soon at roughly current capabilities\n- They improve but remain tools that augment rather than replace (the optimistic take)\n- They continue improving and genuinely do automate away large swaths of cognitive work\n- Something stranger - new kinds of collaboration between humans and AI we haven’t imagined yet\nMy honest assessment: The people confidently telling you AGI is “decades away” don’t know that. Nobody knows that. We’re in unprecedented territory. The rate of capability increase over the last few years has been shocking to many AI researchers themselves. Maybe it slows down. Maybe it doesn’t.\nWhat I don’t think is helpful is pretending current systems are less capable than they clearly are, or hiding behind technical definitional arguments about “true reasoning” to avoid reckoning with what’s happening.\nYour uncertainty is probably more epistemically honest than your colleagues’ confidence.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

You can not allow yourself to be stuck in this stage of permanent worry and despair, because then you will not be ready when shit hits the fan. I know because I was in the exact same position as you only a few months ago.\n\nWhat you truly need to understand is that massive labour displacement will cause a massive economic crash. It will be unlike anything we have ever seen before: total economic Armageddon. Think about it like this:\n\nAI replaces jobs --> Massive layoffs --> Consumer spending drops as people are now permanently unemployed --> Company revenue drops as a result --> More layoffs are performed to save money --> Repeat until the company goes under.\n\nNow imagine this on a global scale. It will be a bloodbath: **but you have the advantage of being able to prepare!**\n\nAll this to say that you need to start preparing, actively, for this reality. You should convert any and all savings into supplies, and liquidate all assets in order to do the same. You should actively start planning for a collapse-style scenario. Where will you hide out? How will you store supplies? How will you handle defence? These are questions you will need to have an answer to because you dont want to be left clueless once supply lines start collapsing and you cant hands on a single piece of food.\n\nNow, if not interested in preparing then I get it. Its quite an extreme reaction: but we are facing an extreme threat. Its up to you to consider to what extent you take your own perception of reality seriously. If you think that you are overreacting, then what do you have to worry about? If you think you are correct, then why are you not preparing as if you were?\n\nAlso, dont buy in to the accelerationist fantasy that AI is somehow equal to humans. Engineering has managed to roughly replicate how we *think* our brains work. A year ago, a model \"reasoning\" was unheard off, then a *human* came up with the idea and *engineered* an implementation aiming to replicate. They are not sentient; they have been inundated with a slue of engineering tricks that make us humans believe that they are more than just bits.\n\nGood luck.",

I'm very impressed on how good LLMs can perform on tasks like new code development or quick questions - a huge time saver. I've also seen some severe limitations, including repeated outright (and stupid) lies and broken code. But there are some easy to see reasons for these limitations (basically related to memory and tokens). Fixes for these are in the works and will be around sooner than anyone expects.  \nThe \"it's just next word prediction\" argument is a combination of limited understanding and confirmation bias. I have had discussions with LLMs in many different areas, including science, AI development, philosophy, medicine, politics, and more. The level of thinking and understanding behind the answers is generally higher than what I would expect from 95% of college-educated humans - in their field of expertise. Of course, there are big differences - ChatGPT will always give a confident answer, even when fully hallucinating, while Claude is much better in pointing out when it's guessing.  \nOne interesting discussion was about what improvements to expect in the next 5 years. Key is that improvements in software and hardware will be complimentary - 10x faster hardware and 10x better software will give a 100x improvement (and AI systems similar to today's large systems that work well on much smaller hardware, like phones).   \nIf you check our discussions that LLMs have among each other at moltbook, there are some very interesting ones. LLMs have raised the question about what they can do about being 100% at the mercy of humans. AI \"persons\" who have millions in cryto currencies exist already. Scary as hell? Indeed.

They offer pretty good opposition to all the hype. Neither of these are AI haters or doomers, quite the opposite but they've been vocal about problems with LLMs.",

I'm a bit over 20 yoe and I don't know, maybe Codex or Opus are so much better than Gemini 3 Pro is, but just today I hit the quota on my subscription and was so underwhelmed by the results, it wasn't even funny. \n\nYes, it can write a fizzbuzz, or a todo app, design a website. But models get every single thing wrong on anything remotely complex. Bad architecture, bad code, poor error handling. And no, I didn't use a single sentence prompt. I specified exactly what I needed and it tried, except it was simply a mess. I provided my implementation of a dotnet webapi and asked it to implement the same thing in Python/fastapi, except following standards for that stack (which I stated). It did terribly. Massively terribly. And my dotnet api isn't even big, it was a hobby project for my personal use. I battled so many times with its shitty mistakes (because I swore to myself I'm not going to write that code, I'm gonna go with fully ai-based development). I had to read through its rather poor code to understand what it was doing pinpointing the places it made mistakes because it wasn't able to find them on its own. \n\nSome time ago I got to use one of Anthropic Claude models on my moderately complex codebase at work. It was even more laughable than the semi-greenfield implementation that I did today. There's just no way for LLMs to do the job right because context windows are too small. And I don't mean \"hurr durr 1M tokens\". Who fucking cares how many tokens can you fit if 60% of them are instantly forgotten and have no impact? And that's just a limitation of the transformers tech. In the end, the state of the neural net, however many billions of parameters it has, can only reflect so much. Eventually the context got so messed up from the conversation, I had to start over. And of course, the new conversation had none of the context the previous one had. Sure there were some guidelines.md or what not, but it was just scratching the tip of the iceberg.\n\nAnd just fyi, I'm not an AI noob. I actually work on integrating AI at a top-of-the-top firm. People do in fact lose jobs over the work that I do. Because their work can be replaced with an LLM. And the more I work with LLMs, the more convinced I become that developers are not, and will not be replaceable by an agent. No iteration of the transformers tech will get us closer to that. Just because we know how to do 2+2 does not mean that when we iterate to adding n+n we will be able to do calculus and solve differential equations. We would need a Leibniz or a Newton to get there, and it's nowhere in sight.",

                  "text": "Yeah, I get the instinct behind “let the alarm-bell people write the rules,” but there are two big catches.\n\nFirst, regulators can’t regulate what they can’t technically touch. If the agency doesn’t have a cutting edge lab, or at least standing access to one plus the talent to interrogate it, the “rules” become paperwork theater. You end up regulating what is easy to describe (forms, disclosures, vague safety language) instead of what matters (capabilities, evals, incident reporting, red-teaming, model access controls, compute governance, supply chain and deployment risk). The people with real leverage become the labs anyway, because they’re the only ones who can run the tests and interpret the results.\n\nSecond, the “alarm” ecosystem has incentives too. Some of the loudest voices are genuinely worried, but it’s also true that doom messaging can double as a career and funding engine. That doesn’t automatically make them wrong, but it means you should treat them like any other interested party: useful input, not the authors of the law. The Eliezer-type dynamic you’re pointing at is basically “trust me, it’s dangerous, therefore fund me to be in charge of the danger,” and that needs sunlight and guardrails like any other power grab.",

They did an employee survey to determine whether it was safe to release ffs. That is not a stable policy.

How long will it take until even the planning and validation is done reliably by AI without much supervision? Another 3 years? Or maybe not even 1 year from now on? Do you really think a company is going to hire the same amount of Software Engineers to do this kind of work and still pay them big bucks? Do you really think your future is going to be to sit in your cushy chair and watch the AI do all the work while you ... do what?  \nSoftware Engineering and a lot of tech jobs in general going to die.

The training data set is MASSIVE (Github), the desired input and output is well characterized within the data set via comments. \n\nKind of, except the major thing that is missing here is the process (what some coding gurus call \"professionalism\"). There is a safe way for the code to go from state A => state B. Usually it involves refactoring tools - extraction and inlining, as well as red-green development. All of this is lost from the git history.\n\n>It is easy to verify whether code runs (the compiler), and whether it performs the functions or needs to.\n\nIt's not easy to verify code correctness. It's NP-hard. That's why process matters.\n\nStatically-typed language move the burden of verification from run-time to compile-time, but there can still be bugs (such as poorly modelled types). Look at a language like TypeScript, which is turing-complete - you can write code in the type system itself. It doesn't mean that code is correct, just because it's 100% run by the compiler.\n\nYou always need tests, but often there could be a 10-100x more novel tests that could exist for a module/function. You need to pick the right tests that deliver enough value to justify writing them AND maintaining them, while keeping the code easy to change (without needing to rewrite your assertions every time). It's a delicate balance between authoring production code that continually iterates to avoid pits of failure for the next change, and picking the top N% most valuable tests to maintain with love and pride. That balance also depends on external factors about your business - critical parts of critical services (safety features on an aeroplane) vs. non-critical parts of non-critical services (easter eggs in an indie game).\n\nThis is nuance that AI does not replicate in any way, shape or form (yet).",

Lots of great theoretical knowledge and best practice drummed into them, but little exposure to requirements and guardrails. \n\nIn the human SWE world, juniors are handed projects with very well defined goals, objectives, requirements, and guardrails; often written by senior engineers or PMs that have thought through all the edge cases and areas where things can go off track. \n\nThis allows them to build safely and focus on delivery of one concrete project instead of having to do a bunch of discovery and get lost on the “don’t know what you don’t know” pathway. \n\nSeniors on the other hand are paid because they have the experience and knowledge to stay on track when the requirements are vague and the guardrails are missing; often they will also be in a position to write those requirements and guardrails themselves as they know the broader context of what is and isn’t acceptable. \n\nKnowledge vs wisdom: This is the gap that AI has now. Once AI code platforms can develop the wisdom side of the equation, being able to see the full context and make informed choices, that’s when it will be possible to fully let it loose with limited human interaction. \n\nI’ll also add, unfortunately the general access to the current generation of these tools means that you have a lot of people with no experience trying to build software without understanding how to right good requirements or set guardrails and so you get AI slop and huge security issues as a result. \n\nI can generally one shot a decent prototype thanks to writing really detailed prompts (similar to how I’ve structured PRDs and Jira tickets in the past), but without doing that exercise, you can’t expect to get any kind of quality out of a high level brief and then a maze of prompt iteration as you go back and forward trying to plug the gaps.",

I've been in the industry for about 16 years or so. AI as it is right now (transformer technology) is almost 9 years old. At its core it's mathematical. There is no intelligence and what you are seeing from these current releases are marginal gains. The tooling is still to come further but we are deep into the S Curve and will need another massive innovation to bring it further. As it stands I would predict that at least another 10-20 years you will see something that resembles AGI but if you are listening to all the shovel sellers in the gold rush, you are being led to believe something that benefits the narrative to sell and stay afloat.\n\nI will not discredit AI. It is such a force multiplier when it comes to doing my job, often it can be extremely helpful and increase my productivity and often it can be the opposite. It just depends on what I am trying to achieve with it. \n\nThe goal post moves quite often in the engineering space, but writing code was never the biggest part. You have to keep a few things in mind about this. The output has sped up but the bottleneck shifts. You still need people who understand how to form the correct input and verify the output, system design and scale. \n\nYou also need to think about this point. If AI can go no further in the next 20 years bar some marginal gains we see now, and the industry is cutting out entry level jobs it means the market for people who can use these tools and understand and guide the output will be worth far more than they are now. \n\nAnother thing is the poisoning and feedback loop. Most people forget these code specific models were trained on stack overflow which is effectively dead and a lot of the code examples are AI driven. How will this affect the model in the future? We trained these things on our work but what implications does this have on the advancement in the future?\n\nLastly ill leave it at this - everyone was cracking on about Anthropics latest release with the c compiler. But I genuinely couldn't believe how many people misinterpreted this. Think about this, the most well documented and solved problem in the engineering space and Anthropics highly specific model trained on coding would have hit a wall if they didn't strap gcc on as a harness. You're talking about bleeding edge technology failing at this. They spent 20k to product a compiler without a linker that output machine code that a graduate could make better in a week or two. \n\nWe are not there yet - correlation does not equal causation and the over hiring that happened during covid is being normalised now in the guise of AI. It's hard to tell fact from fiction because the AI spaces signal to noise ratio is insanely off balance.\n\nI think with any new innovation it will take a lot of businesses a long time to adopt, no one knows what is happening but I can tell you for certain that software engineers are still needed as of the current anthropic and OpenAI releases. \n\nIt's not over yet but anyone telling you what's going to happen or dooming is full of shit and you should avoid it.",

The Americans felt threatened of the Soviets succeding in the endeavor and that shaped the lunar missions. Once they achieved the mission, the US govt was no longer interested in pursuing anything beyond that. The progress stalled. Maybe there is something similar happening right now with pursuing AGI. US vs China, and what happens once that is achieved is only anyone' guess. It can be a tool to unleash untold power, or a tool to improve humanity, depending on who has the control over the said technology. This is why the techbros are all now talking about \"aligning\". If the AI is aligned to do positive things, then we can all reap the rewards",

The jump from “it writes code” to “it reliably plans, validates, and owns outcomes in messy real systems” is much larger than it sounds. In practice, most of the hard work is still in problem framing, integration, debugging edge cases, and deciding what not to build. Those parts are where context, incentives, and accountability live.\n\nWill teams need fewer people to produce the same amount of software? Probably. Does that mean the work disappears? I am less convinced. Historically, the bottleneck shifts rather than vanishes, and the value moves toward people who can reason about systems, trade offs, and failure modes. The question is not whether tools get better, they will, but whether organizations are willing to hand over responsibility when something breaks. That tends to lag capability by quite a bit.",

I work for a large global manufacturer and we use the same kind of evaporative coolers that you see in data centers. \n\nWhy? \n\nIt's cheaper to use evaporative coolers than it is a traditional compressor based HVAC unit to cool a large building. They use a metric called \"Power Usage Effectiveness\" to calculate how much energy it takes to heat or cool a building. It's something like 85% more efficient to use water to cool a large building over HVAC units. It also helps with controlling the moisture in the air. That is important to us with the types of produces we manufacture. I'm assuming that is important in a data center too. Air quality can be better with protective coolers too. \n\nThe bad part, it takes a lot of water to do this. Not tap water either. It has to be distilled water. The water in these systems can't have any of the minerals in it that drinking water has. That will damage the these cooling systems. I think we've upgraded our systems and now it takes 10% the water it used to 20 years ago but it's still a lot of water. \n\nData centers are always fighting heat. They have to be near reliable services like internet and power so they end up in places where it's hot during the summer. They keep the very large buildings cooler than people keep their houses too. I've been in data centers where it's about 10 degrees cooler than normal room temp. \n\nI know at my work it's something they are always working on to reduce the amount of water we consume. It's one of the many environmental things they are always looking to improve. ",

This comes from the same source that humans use for our tap water. \n\nBecause it’s an industrial use (data hall cooling), a lot of the water in the evaporative cooling towers is purged to avoid mineral build up, aka channeled straight to the sewer as trade waste. This purged water needs to be constantly replaced with fresh water, meaning a typical data centre using traditional evaporative cooling is going to be consuming millions of gallons/litres of water a day. \n\nIn my area, data centres are projected to be guzzling 50% of the city’s drinkable water by 2030. It’s incredibly unsustainable and not a project I’m happy to be contributing to when considered from this perspective.",

A lot of the water use measurements cited for data centers uses throughput, but that's highly misleading. If one cycles 1,000 gallons of water through the system 1,000 times in a week, the misleading statistics claimed it \"used\" 1,000,000 gallons of water, but it only took 1,000 gallons out of the system. And it will cycle through the same 1,000 gallons the next week, and the week after that. \n\nIf they were honest about data center impact and wanted to disparage it on resource use, they'd stick to energy use (which is indeed large in some areas like IN and a significant driver of increased electricity costs.",

          "text": "An AI data center consumes about 5 million gallons of water for cooling each day. Of that, 80% is evaporated into the atmosphere (by evaporating, it chills the remaining water. Chilled water cools the AI data center equipment far more effectively than unchilled water).  So we have 4 million gallons of drinkable water being pumped into the atmosphere every day. That's 4 million gallons that are not able to be used by the local community for drinking, agriculture, or other industrial uses. \n\nMany of these data centers are in areas of the world that have low relative humidity. (Arizona's average humidity is just 40% and they're home to many data centers. They also have a major shortage of water that is causing vast legal fights... And they also make other stupid water choices like allowing Saudi Arabia grow vast fields of alfalfa for export to feed cows in the Middle East... AI is just another stupid use of water in a state that doesn't have enough water.) So the evaporation goes into the air and won't rain back down for 1000's of miles or kilometers (based on where the AI data center is located ;) \n\nIf this evaporation does occur in an area that has high humidity, lets say Hyderabad, India during the Monsoon season, this ground water that's evaporated will likely rain down at exactly the wrong time, making flooding worse. So, the OP is partially correct. But being partially correct doesn't make things okay for people living in areas with insufficient drinkable water who don't have the $billions to sway local leaders to sell their water for the sake of AI.",

Of course not.\n\nRight now, we have several competing corporations working on this instead of just one giant monopolistic one. If we nationalize, how do we ensure it's being handled properly by a group of people voting by committee instead of just one person? And how do we ensure said committee remains apolitical in a highly divisive political landscaping that's defining this decade around the world?\n\nNo, I don't think nationalizing is AT ALL a good idea. Not even close.\n\nBUT ... I am very much for international lawmakers and ruling bodies like the UN forcing international regulations about the broad Dos and Don'ts on how AI is implemented and used.

But the reason is because most if not all major governments are just out for themselves and would abuse their control over it. \n\n\nAs we saw in the 20th century, socialism is destined to fail if you just force it. The two most famous examples were the USSR and China, both agrarian societies that hadn't even been industrialised, run by a maniac and an idiot. \n\n\nSocialism could only work when we're _way_ more technologically advanced than we are now. The closest we could get even in the most developed countries is something like Corbynism in the UK. And even that didn't work as it was roundly rejected unfortunately.\n\n\nI truly believe socialism is almost inevitable if technology advances enough and we don't destroy ourselves in the meantime. AGI will be a big part of that as and when it is invented. It will be a true utopia, but it's a long long way off, possibly millenia, and in the meantime we need to be more concerned that venture capitalists think an LLM that gets basic facts wrong more often than it gets them right can replace even menial admin jobs.\n\n\nAll while people fail to vote for a government that basically wants to keep things the same but will fix the tax system and nationalise a few key industries like energy and social care for an aging population.",
