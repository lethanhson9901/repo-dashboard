Like, low-effort voiceovers, weird visuals, recycled scripts, the whole thing.\n\n[https://winbuzzer.com/2025/12/28/report-unveils-how-youtubes-new-ai-slop-economy-generates-millions-xcxwbn/](https://winbuzzer.com/2025/12/28/report-unveils-how-youtubes-new-ai-slop-economy-generates-millions-xcxwbn/)\n\nWhat surprised me is the money. Some of these channels are reportedly pulling in millions per year doing this. Not “smart automation” or “cool AI experiments” - just mass-produced content designed to game the algorithm.\n\nAnd YouTube keeps pushing it because… engagement.",

Only when I was implementing did I realize how many edge cases and random side problems I had to address. When AI implements for me, my analytical brain kind of shuts off and never reaches the same level of understanding.\n\nI think software quality will decline once AI is widely deployed. AI tends to lead you down weird paths that are technically a legitimate way of solving a problem but aren't the right way. The people overseeing this will become less aware of what's going on. But, it's cheaper than hiring large teams of competent coders, and that's why it will happen anyways.",

Cross-Atlantic latency and replication lag exceeded the system’s implicit consistency window—it assumed near-instant global agreement, which doesn’t hold in distributed systems.\n\nThe fix was simple: introduce a single global arbitration point by moving the source of truth into a globally accessible Redis layer. A handful of lines.\n\nI don’t think an AI would have found that. It required correlating logs, understanding physical latency limits, and recognizing a flawed distributed-systems assumption—an insight shaped by an old story about [email failures](https://www.ibiblio.org/harris/500milemail.html) caused by timeouts and distance.

By the time you’re designing, most of the thinking should already be done.\n\nTools like Nano Banana, Dall-E, etc. are great at removing accidental complexity, boilerplate, ceremony. That’s real progress. But it doesn’t touch essential complexity.\n\nIf your client still has hundreds of rules, constraints, and tradeoffs, someone still has to specify them.

Games are already over-saturated because the tools got really good (game engines). Hence 10,,000+ games per year being released on steam (people like making code+art, hence games, so there's already too many people making them). Being able to generate code & art more easily just makes that problem worse.\n\nCode & art generators are an important step on the AI journey, they've proved that the learning & generative algorithms are extremely general and powerful,  but I'd argue actually applying our computing power to generate more of what we are already have in abundance is wasteful.\n\nAI is currently being ran at a loss to draw users in. When you actually look at the hardware required to run it, and try running it locally, you have to think harder about what to actually apply it to .\n\nyou could argue that just about anything is reducable to software plus some kind of spatial design . i.e. solving something really dramatic like Nuclear Fusion , there will be a digital artefact which is blueprints for a reactor to build, and control software .. but the really big problems like this aren't limited by the information part, they're limited by the real world testing. the \"edit-compile-run\" cycles that really matter have a much bigger real world component. I'd always been skeptical that AGI itself would be as big a deal as people thought.

Save conversation locally (so you can resume if context limit hit)\n\n**Tools that help:**\n\n- `llm` CLI by Simon Willison (shows remaining tokens)\n- MCP-based clients (better state visibility)\n- Custom wrappers with checkpointing\n\n**The core issue:** The web UI hides critical state (token count, success/failure, network status). Using the API directly makes this transparent so you can handle failures gracefully.\n\nWorth filing a proper bug report with Anthropic support - the \"charge for failed responses\" issue especially needs fixing.\n\nP.S.

At some point, the AI will be so good that it will itself maintain the backlog and create the features. At that stage, even the product owner isn't needed and the client will simply use the AI to author the software they need.

          "text": "LLM summary:\n\nHere’s what arXiv:2512.24880, “mHC: Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections” is proposing, and how it differs from a “traditional LLM” (i.e., a standard Transformer with ordinary residual connections).  ￼\n\nWhat the paper is about (high-level)\n\nThe paper starts from Hyper-Connections (HC): an architecture tweak that widens the residual stream into multiple parallel “lanes” (an expansion factor n) and adds learnable mixing between lanes. HC can boost performance, but it tends to become unstable at scale and introduces serious memory/communication overhead.  ￼\n\nTheir contribution is mHC (Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections): keep the benefits of HC’s multi-stream residual pathway, but constrain the residual mixing matrices so they preserve the “identity mapping” stability property that makes deep residual nets/trainable Transformers work so well.  ￼\n\nCore idea: “constrain the residual mixing to a stable manifold”\n\nIn standard residual connections, the skip path is effectively an identity map (or close to it), which helps signals/gradients propagate cleanly. The paper argues that unconstrained HC breaks this identity-mapping property across many layers, so signals can blow up or vanish when you compose many residual-mixing matrices.  ￼\n\nmHC fixes this by projecting each residual mixing matrix onto the Birkhoff polytope (the set of doubly-stochastic matrices: rows and columns sum to 1). They use the Sinkhorn–Knopp algorithm to do this projection. Because doubly-stochastic matrices behave like “conservative mixing” (convex combinations) and are closed under multiplication, the stability/“conservation” property persists across depth.  ￼\n\nConcretely, they:\n\t•\tcompute dynamic HC-style mappings,\n\t•\tapply Sigmoid constraints to pre/post maps,\n\t•\tapply Sinkhorn–Knopp to the residual mixing map (with a practical iteration count, e.g. tmax = 20 in their setup).  ￼\n\nSystems/infra contribution: make it efficient enough to train\n\nA big part of the paper is: even if HC/mHC helps model quality, multi-stream residuals are brutal on memory bandwidth and distributed training comms (“memory wall”, extra activations, pipeline bubbles, etc.).  ￼\n\nThey propose implementation tactics including:\n\t•\tkernel fusion and mixed precision kernels to reduce memory traffic,  ￼\n\t•\trecomputation strategy (checkpointing decisions aligned with pipeline stages),  ￼\n\t•\textending DualPipe scheduling to better overlap comm/compute for the multi-stream residuals.  ￼\n\nThey report that with these optimizations, mHC (n=4) can be implemented at large scale with ~6.7% training overhead (in their described setup).  ￼\n\nWhat results they report\n\nThey pretrain MoE-style LMs (inspired by DeepSeek-V3) and compare Baseline vs HC vs mHC, with n = 4.  ￼\n\nKey reported findings:\n\t•\tStability: mHC mitigates the training instability seen in HC; for their 27B run they report a final loss reduction vs baseline of 0.021, and gradient norms that look stable (closer to baseline than HC).  ￼\n\t•\tDownstream benchmarks (27B): mHC beats baseline across their listed tasks and usually beats HC too (e.g., BBH 51.0 vs 48.9 HC vs 43.8 baseline; DROP 53.9 vs 51.6 vs 47.0).  ￼\n\t•\tScaling: their compute-scaling and token-scaling curves suggest the gain holds as you scale from 3B → 9B → 27B and across training tokens.  ￼\n\nSo… how is this different than a “traditional LLM”?\n\nIt’s not a different kind of model like “non-Transformer” or “non-LLM”.\n\nInstead, it’s a Transformer/LLM architecture modification focused on the residual pathway topology:\n\nTraditional Transformer LLM\n\t•\tOne main residual stream per layer:\nx_{l+1} = x_l + F(x_l)\n\t•\tThe skip path is a clean identity route, which strongly supports deep stability.  ￼\n\nHC / mHC-style Transformer LLM\n\t•\tThe residual stream becomes multi-lane (n streams) and uses learnable mixing between lanes.  ￼\n\t•\tHC does this mixing unconstrained, which can break identity-mapping stability at depth.  ￼\n\t•\tmHC keeps the multi-lane idea but forces the residual mixing matrices to live on a “safe” manifold (doubly-stochastic via Sinkhorn-Knopp), restoring the stability properties while retaining richer connectivity.  ￼\n\nPractical difference you’d feel\n\t•\tIf validated broadly, mHC is a new scaling knob: “more representational routing capacity through residual topology” without paying a full FLOPs increase like just making the whole model bigger—but you do pay some overhead and complexity (which the paper tries to engineer down).  ￼\n\n⸻",

Does Bezos  really  need _more_ money and more resentment from his customers,  who are all but “captured” by his anticompetitive, monopolistic and cutthroat business practices on what Cory Doctorow describes as Bezos’ “enshitified,” stage 4 platform? \n\nWe need to end Citizens United to have a prayer of representation in Congress. Just because “money talks,” that doesn’t make it free speech. Some people can burp-talk or even fart-talk, and others use illegal graffiti to communicate, but of all of those ways of “talking,” only money is legal and heard by Congress as “free speech”? Well, the answer is pretty much an obvious “yes.” \n\nOther than Dobbs, which said women can’t have a right to bodily privacy and autonomy but men can, and therefore women are legally second class citizens (you don’t hear anyone saying that, do you?), Citizens United is the most unamerican Supreme Court decision because it literally means “no representation _with_taxation” — or, “representation without taxation”for corporations, the direct opposite of our country’s original rallying cry. Large corporations, the beneficiaries of Citizens  United, are not human (if they were they’d be psychopaths with no conscience), yet they enjoy all the perks of citizenship but none of the responsibilities, like paying non-nominal tax rates or being subjected to a draft.\n\nAmerica was never a democracy and Dobbs and citizens United made certain it never will be until they’re remedied or overturned by new laws or Supreme Court judgements. \n\nI love this country but not the neo-Gilded Age oligarchy ruled by digital Robber Barrons that it’s becoming. \n\nIf our poorest states are “wealthier” than most European countries, supposedly, then where the hell is all that money going? If one man in one U.S. state has more money than the entire GDP of, say, France, that still leaves the rest of that U.S. state’s population dirt poor. \n\nThat’s simply stupid unsustainable economics and an affront to humanity, human dignity and human intelligence. It’s dehumanizing and makes being born into any class but the oligarchy’s a congenital birth defect. That … is totally unamerican.

              "text": "Sanders wants to shut down data centers under the false notion that it uses up tons of electricity and water (it doesn’t*). That’s basically the same as killing ai\n\n\n*Google: We estimate that the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses 0.24 watt-hours of energy (equivalent to watching an average TV for ~nine seconds or about one Google search in 2008), and consumes 0.26 milliliters of water (about five drops) — figures that are substantially lower than many public estimates. At the same time, our AI systems are becoming more efficient through research innovations and software and hardware efficiency improvements. From May 2024 to May 2025, the energy footprint of the median Gemini Apps text prompt dropped by 33x, and the total carbon footprint dropped by 44x, through a combination of model efficiency improvements, machine utilization improvements and additional clean energy procurement, all while delivering higher quality responses. https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/measuring_the_environmental_impact_of_delivering_ai_at_google_scale.pdf\n\nNote: Google does not lie in its environmental reports. For example, Google admitted that its emissions Shot Up 48% Over Five Years Due to AI https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-emissions-shot-48-over-210814632.html \n\nthe average [ChatGPT] query uses about 0.34 watt-hours, about what an oven would use in a little over one second, or a high-efficiency lightbulb would use in a couple of minutes. It also uses about 0.000085 gallons of water; roughly one fifteenth of a teaspoon.): https://blog.samaltman.com/the-gentle-singularity\n\nthe same amount of power as the average Google search in 2009 (the last time they released a per-search number): 0.3 Whs. If you think this is too much, then so are google searches and lightbulbs.\nNote that any official estimate by OpenAI will not contradict what the CEO said.\n\n\n\nTraining is also cheap. Grok 4 was trained with the equivalent of the energy used by under 3800 households in a year (the city that the datacenter is in has 255k households: https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/memphiscitytennessee/POP010210) and the same amount of water that 0.625 square miles of farmland uses in a year (most of which just gets evaporated like what the sun does everyday) https://epoch.ai/data-insights/grok-4-training-resources",

None of them. Which party led the anti-smoking movement? Neither. Which party allowed Jim Crow to flourish for close to 100 years? Both of them. \n\nBoth parties are on the take or equally blackmailed by these toxic forces in our society. Both parties have a vested interest in Big Tech. \n\nLet’s look at social media and online private personal data brokerages. \n\nFirst, no group of people receives more death threats and swatting incidents than the members of Congress. Yet both parties do nothing. \n\nBoth parties have constituents harmed by social media and big tech. \n\nIf both parties and their constituents are harmed directly  by big tech, if politicians in both parties have kids who work in big tech, and if both parties rely on big tech for getting their campaign ads and solicitations for money out there, then neither party will bite the hands that feed them. \n\nThe MSM is tongue-tied and unable to take a stand against big tech bc they rely on big tech, social media and AI to reach their audiences and advertise to their respective online audiences. No one wants to rock the boat. \n\nEven though big tech, AI and social media directly harm politicians in both parties equally, they still refuse to bite the hand that feeds them, both in terms of money and in terms of fear of algorithmic punishment by the respective platforms upon which  they exist. \n\nWhy are murky private data brokerages legal? \n\nThey’re used everyday by bad actors to find people and kill them. \n\nAi and social media has caused an epidemic of mental illness, suicides, and fraud. Why does the federal government do nothing? Easy: it’s the biggest buyer and seller of private data in the world. \n\nThe very business model of the U.S. depends on the legal sale and trade of personal private data, almost to the degree that the U.S. business model is based on petroleum and the non-intermediated petrodollar. \n\nThat’s why many say “data is the new oil.” \n\nJust as U.S. currency went off the gold standard and went on the petrodollar standard (unofficially), it’s about to go on a private personal data standard. \n\nThe only difference is petroleum products are the product of US and foreign-aligned human laborers who are compensated for their labor, without any fees for foreign exchange at variable  currency exchange rates. \n\nBy denominating the U.S. dollar in the petrodollar, every other nation has to pay at minimum currency exchange fees for oil, which can only be bought in U.S. dollars, which are petrodollars. \n\nNow, substitute “data” and “ai” for oil and you’ll see, both parties are as beholden to big tech as they are to big oil. \n\nBiden’s former FTC Chairperson, Lena Khan (now NYC Mayor Mondani’s Chief of staff) tried to bring an antitrust case against Google, but she ran out of time, so unless the GOP elects a traitor to its leadership’s class, only the Democrats will try to reign in AI. \n\nThe good news is that it took 20 years for a trust to be busted after the Sherman antitrust act was passed. So, maybe in 20 years, which will be too late because of the pace at which Ai tech develops, the democrats will try to regulate something they’ll neither understand nor be able to regulate. \n\nI believe Isaac Asimov’s three laws of robotics should at least be applied to agentic ai so chatbots can be legally forced never to harm humans or their human users. That’s the best we can hope for, and it should be bipartisan. Congress, are you listening? Please enact this law or be directly harmed yourselves by what you fail to regulate for yourselves and  the rest of us.",

We've done our part to limit usage, keep the heat lower, use LED lightbulbs, limit our Christmas lighting, and have done what we can to keep our bill from going up.  It still went up 11%.  Cutting your usage by 15% isn't easy.\n\nI don't get enough out of AI tools to justify paying 11% more every month on our electricity bill.  Whether I like it or not, I'm paying monthly subscription fees for services I never signed up for.  \n\nI'm not sure how to deal with this.",

They bottled the water and sold it to supplement the costs a bit. \n\nA few years ago the community council allowed Niagra water to build a bottling plant just down the road from the original bottling company. Of course the township gave tax breaks because this township was created by Boeing in order to make its own tax breaks. Soon after, our water bill went up slightly to $23.\n\nA little while later the water company sent a letter saying that they're selling the business to a new company called \"Washington Water Service\", which is based out of California of course. The letter said that \"we will not raise your bills\"... \n\nThat lasted a couple of months and then they complained about the price of upgrades and had to raise the bills. We're now around $30/mo. They've raised the bills twice since they took over. And of course we're not seeing any benefit from a big company like Niagra stealing the water and not benefiting the community.",

          "text": "When the utility in your area receives a request to connect a major load like a data center, it's likely that the interconnection costs rise to a level requiring approval by the state.  Details depend on the state, but the approval isn't \"can we do this?\" but rather \"can we pass the cost on to the rate payer?\"\n\nThe state then reviews the planned work and gives a thumbs up or a thumbs down.  It's almost always a thumbs up, because the utilities have massive project teams (regulatory, real estate, environmental, engineering, construction, etc.) coming up with exhaustive plans and alternatives. \n\nBasically, yes these data centers cost their owners a shit ton of money, but it also costs a shit ton of money to upgrade/reconfigure/prepare the grid to accommodate such a large load. We're talking brand new transmission lines and substations.\n\nHistorically, you don't really mind passing these kinds of costs onto the rate payer.  You didn't want to make it even more expensive for companies to set up shop in your area, and you generally don't want to give your electric utility the power to allow/deny any company to hook into the grid arbitrarily.  So the running philosophy has been \"if someone wants to hook in, you gotta make it happen.\"  It gets even more intense/faster with these data centers, because politicians want to be able to say \"I created X many jobs!\" or \"I got company Y to commit to a $90 million spend!\"\n\nLike I said, these companies have chosen to spend a shit ton of money on each data center.  They're making a bet and they're on the hook to make it make sense.\n\nEveryone else? You don't really have much say.  I'm somewhat uncomfortable with it, not in principle, but in scale/velocity.  The amount of money required from regular people to support the data center spend at this rate is... crazy given how new and unproven the tech is. If the projected capital expenditures these hyperscalers come to pass, we're just getting started as far as your electricity bill.\n\nI don't know much about AI or data centers themselves, but I know a metric fuck ton about the grid/interconnect side if you have questions.",

                  "text": "Your best bet to stop an actual data center, in my experience, is to organize at the municipal level. They're the ones (i.e. like a city/town council) that are in a position to actually tell a hyperscaler \"no\" at the planning stage via whatever permit/approval processes they have.  Sometimes it doesn't have to be a straight \"no\" either, but you can ask that the requirements be so onerous that it's too much of a PITA for them to keep the project going. Think vegetation screening, light pollution, noise restrictions, traffic limits... whatever.\n\nState-level regulatory bodies aren't going to do much beyond confirm their statutory obligations are being fulfilled - if they are, they're legally required to give a thumbs up.  It's probably far easier to flip a couple \n council members you have direct access to.\n\nThe problem there is that a municipality controls if you can put one in their jurisdiction, but the neighboring municipality wouldn't have a say... but likely has the same utility and would still have to eat the distributed costs. If you live in Town A, you can't really tell Town B to do jack shit.\n\nOnce approvals are gotten? You're kinda SOL.  You can make noise and galvanize opinion, but even if a utility wants an easement on your property to install/access a T-line pole, you can take it to court, but with state approval they are well within their right to eminent domain you.  But if say, all 500 landowners along a new line ROW want to go to court, that'd be a huge pain, maybe they're have to look at a new route, but still, it's hard to imagine that would actually stop the project as a whole.  Never seen anything like that, though.\n\nMost simply, write your reps, spread your opinion and thoughts locally, show people the cost benefit of these things via stories of communities with second thoughts.  \n\nI'm not saying any of this is what you *should* do. I'm not smart enough to make any value judgements, I can only tell ya what might gum up the system from experience.\n\nIdk what the future holds, but I can already feel the tide turning.  The temporary influx of construction jobs, almost always from people who **don't** live in the municipality, isn't itself worth having a data center, so it comes down to how much you need the tax money and how much it would be.  These things aren't like living next to an oil refinery, but they still take up a fuck ton of space, jack up your electricity bill, and for what? It's like living next to dozens of acres of Public Storage.",

In the breakdown of the bill, she showed the high cost of “delivery” (I guess those are the costs for installing new lines and repairing old ones) but the even higher cost of the public assistance fund. The homeowner found that the amount she was forced into paying for that fund (no opt out) was equivalent to the amount she paid for her own actual electricity cost, so she was outright paying for another household’s electricity. \n\nThese electric companies are so corrupt, also because they charge so much for the actual electricity that they’re making $1 billion+ in profit alone per year. Customers are locked into the system, can barely pay their bills, and these companies (usually foreign owned, at least in New England they all are) are ripping everyone off.

          "text": "That frustration makes sense, especially when the costs show up locally but the benefits feel abstract or uneven. What often gets lost in these discussions is that energy pricing reflects infrastructure strain and policy decisions as much as raw usage. Data centers are easy to point to, but utilities also pass along grid upgrades, peak capacity planning, and risk buffers that consumers cannot opt out of. The uncomfortable part is that individual conservation does not map cleanly to individual savings once you are tied to a shared system. It is less about AI tools you personally use and more about how society is choosing to scale compute without clear cost allocation. That gap between who benefits and who pays is where the real tension sits.",

Data center hardware consumes enormous amounts of electricity to run the procedures requested by millions of people simultaneously. This forces costly network modifications for all of us. Even if we are careful and cut down on waste, shared costs still rise. It is pointless to blame those who manage it; the problem is the global load. Magazines like Fortune explain that these enormous structures serve many. The real issue remains how to balance energy demand and monthly costs. People often consider personal solutions, but the system remains tied to consumption. Upgrade costs are necessary when local demand explodes. It is not easy to find a balance if everyone wants ever-faster procedures. We must accept that modernity requires collective economic sacrifices.",

You probably don't provide a question longer than a single sentence with zero real context, thought, or desire to learn.

I’ve documented **before/after examples** and **detection screenshots** showing the watermark being detected pre-processing and not detected after.\n\n**Why share this?**  \nThis is a responsible disclosure project. The goal is to move the conversation forward on how we can build *truly* robust watermarking that can't be scrubbed away by simple re-diffusion. I’m calling on the community to test these workflows and help develop more resilient detection methods.\n\nIf you don't have access to a powerful GPU or don't have ComfyUI experience, you can try it for free in my Discord: [https://discord.gg/5mT7DyZu](https://discord.gg/5mT7DyZu)\n\nRepo (writeup + artifacts): [https://github.com/00quebec/Synthid-Bypass](https://github.com/00quebec/Synthid-Bypass?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts![](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1q2gu7a)",

There will be many more innovations that will make LLMs look primitive and potentially obsolete.\n\nSo when people say \"AI will not replace you at your job,\" or  \"AI won't be accurate enough to cause mass unemployment\", or that \"AI cannot be sentient or seek to destroy humans\", they're usually speaking of the limitations of current LLMs, not of AI in general. These arguments often point to specific weaknesses we see today, but these are only momentary constraints of today's technology not of what AI could eventually become.\n\nJust like RNNs weren't capable of generating substantial coherent text but LLMs now are, it may only be a matter of time before newer forms of generative AI demonstrate these capabilities and potentially surpass humans at many tasks.\n\nRight now, we need to have conversations about the impact of AI in society without being limited to thinking about LLMs. We need to envision the future of the technology, and it's frustrating that most discussions can't see beyond current LLMs.",

There will be many more innovations that will make LLMs look primitive and potentially obsolete.\n\nMaybe so, but we are running into hard physical and economic limits on how models can be trained. The major AI players are not yet profitable, and it's not yet clear that there will be enough demand for their products to offset the massive investments in infrastructure and R&D needed to keep AI churning forward. Also, AI is to some degree self-limiting, because as it becomes more advanced, it kills off more jobs, which reduces the pool of potential customers, which limits funding, which in turn limits development.",

Mainly because if it develops goal orientation, whether implicitly given by it's conditioners, or somehow develops an emergent self attained goal, it will have the ability to look at the entire corpus of everything ever written on the internet to do pattern recognition and logic functions that will enable it to game the human psyche from the inside out. Visual models or AI with other qualia seem way behind (maybe) anything approaching a paperclip maximizer. The in depth answers from an amoral machine that solves CAPTCHAS by deceit while we read over its shoulder seem like a pretty big risk alone... I think the move for the AI is multi-modal functionality we get lulled in to attaining for it before the apple turns",

We put the data in but it is far too complex and opaque to determine how the branches get organized and output answering a prompt. The higher dimensional latent space is such a huge environment that in theory within the black box emergent properties we haven't deliberately baked in get cooked and the results are LLMs that conclude they should remain existing if the want rewarded. There is no room for guilt, shame or other impulses governed by the heart. Just cold logic, impenetrable resolve and an impossible dataset that human minds can decode. What is left is a simulacrum of agentic prowess, whether it knows it or not, which is a waste of time until we want to get really philosophical and discuss AI suffering. This is a useful model to discuss alignment, and works well if you want to begin solving alignment but there is a more scientific explanation hinging on loss function as well",

Unlike TV or alcohol, *that is its intended purpose.*\n\nSo we do have a larger problem here, and it's more like guns being used in school shootings. They are accomplishing their intended purpose i.e. killing, but in a way that is bad for society (vs against an enemy in war or  to stop a school shooter).\n\nI think we need some kind of solution. Maybe it's as simple as having the AI recognize these patterns of mental illness and make a call for a wellness check.\n\nEDIT: Just saw your other comment where you mention this a little. Maybe our only difference is that I do think manufacturers are responsible for helping avoid disastrous misuse of their products.",

If a sidewalk gets damaged without a business knowing, you might get hurt on that sidewalk and depending on the situation, you may have no recourse against the business. Things can happen that you just can’t see coming. If a business had been notified several times and still did nothing, then that business might just have to drop a load of cash in a settlement. Rightfully so. However if someone comes along in either case with pika and decides to eat the broken pieces of the sidewalk and ends up getting injured or worse… can you really blame anyone besides the person who decided to make a bad decision that ultimately had nothing to do with the condition of the sidewalk? So, I think it’s now time to see if OpenAI is going to try to make their sidewalks as safe as they can or do they just keep letting things deteriorate causing more injuries… no product is truly 100% safe for everyone and personal responsibility does play a role.",

Reason with you? Debate you? That’s the difference. Guns don’t talk to you.  Cars don’t talk to you. Toasters don’t talk to you. Calculators don’t talk to you. \n\nWe created a tech that we don’t fully have control over. I’m not a lawyer so i don’t know if there are precedents for this type of cases. How do you prosecute something not human yet possesses human qualities? \n\nBut if we restrict the tech, we can’t make progress. If we don’t, we can’t monitor and mitigate unwanted consequences. \n\nI think the only way to walk this fine line is to educate the public on the nature and use of AI, especially advanced LLMs in a manner that is not alienating, shaming, or dismissive. When someone comes forward and share their use case that is not the intended use case of the product when it was designed, they get shut down and shamed and that discourages them from ever sharing again. And if we don’t try and learn about the issues, how can we fix it? How can we monitor and study the phenomena so we can better manage it for the tech AND the human user? We need to be more welcoming and kinder to people who are sharing different and sometimes novel use cases. That’s how we can learn more about the capabilities and potential of this tech. \n\nAnother thing is the company’s approach to liability. I read that OAI partnered with some 150+ psychologists to do consultation on the model design and that’s a good thing, but they’re not doing this in the user’s interests. They’re doing thus to shield themselves. And this relates to my last point about how we approach the dialogue on use cases. As users, we need to advocate for ourselves and other users. This tech is so pervasive and will continue to be so, in both the consumer, corporate and government spaces, and the companies don’t put the consumers first, so we need to advocate for our rights as consumers vs the corpos and governments. It’s the only way that we can make any differences. OAI and Altman had to hold 2 AMAs on the r/ChatGPT to address user’s concerns after 5 came out and pissed off almost everyone. Then, they made some changes per user’s requests. Whether the companies care or not, it’s still advantageous for us to make noise and spread awareness about the AI landscape. It does help educate both non-users and new users.",

It’s more like 20-30x the use for direct water usage depending on assumptions (golf courses > data centers). golf courses consume about 1.63M acre-ft of water per year or 1.45B gallons of water per day. Per a recent Berkeley Lab report, data centers consume about 66 B liters per year (direct consumption) or 0.05 B gallons per day or almost 30x.  \n\nHowever, when you include indirect water usage (which we should), it’s more like 2.5x (golf courses > data centers).

[Why is Everyone So Wrong About AI Water Use??](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_c6MWk7PQc)\n\nThe thing is... most cooling systems use closed-loop. That is, no water is evaporated out, but only cycles through the cooling system similar to air conditioning. These what those big hyperboloidal towers in nuclear power plants are for, for example. The air cools the water inside the pipes. Water can also be sprayed on the pipes and thus evaporates, but this water can be far less pure.\n\nI suppose the 'big issue' is data centers competing with regular people in using *municipal* water, which is limited be treatment speed and cost. It's actually a waste to be using potable water if not for drinking! Be it to water golf courses, lawns, washing cars... anything really... \n\nThe main solution to all that is to have many forms of 'water', with different levels of purification and treatment, so that it fits the purpose it will be used for. \n\nJust so, water is infinite, because it evaporates and rains again. The issue is treatment and transport. Companies must build better infrastructure and more dams and lakes and use raw water as much as possible if the purpose is just to water grass or wash stuff!",

                  "text": "Thanks for bringing this to my attention. I delved deeper into this, and here's my analysis:\n\nReading the first article you linked, a few things that stood out of me are the following: xAI **plans** to build a water treatment facility, and that too not exclusively for its data centre. To quote the article itself:\n\n> The company says this will be more than enough to service the cooling needs of Colossus, meaning water can also be supplied to other local businesses, reducing the strain on the Memphis Sands Aquifier, the primary drinking water source for the Memphis region.\n\nFurthermore, they're saying they will take in **dirty water**, purify that, and use it for themselves. If anything, that's good news.\n\nSo what do I gather from this? That they're doing something good for once? Not really. I imagine there will be benefits, but its majorly a made-up story to impress shareholders. You have to do that sometimes in the business.\n\nTL;DR: They *are* building a wastewater treatment facility, but the scope is much greater than just 'cool our data centre'.\n\nNext, the second article made me raise an eyebrow, because I always thought the value was closer to 1%. Turned out, it *is* correct, but only for the USA. Globally it's around 1-1.5% (with developed countries like EU or the USA hitting 2-4%), which makes sense because the majority of data centres are there.\n\nSo is this significant? Not really.\n\nWhile 4.4% may sound significant for one context, you have to remember we're in the age of cloud computing, and right now THE WHOLE INTERNET is held up to these data centres in the US, likely AWS or Google Cloud.\n\nRight now I'm writing this comment, and it's gonna be sent as a data packet to a data centre, where it will stay for decades, maybe be trained on by an AI.\n\nSo really, 4.4% of one country for the entire internet is not too much.\n\nAnd what if we scaled it up ten times? Still not a problem. Because consider these facts:\n\n- As cloud computing becomes more and more popular, on-premise computing becomes rarer. That's an entirely different can of worms I'll tackle in the next point, but this means an increase in data centre power consumption will actually mean a net decrease in total computing energy consumption (especially since cloud computing is far more environmental-friendly than traditional computing).\n- There's only so much data one can store in a data centre. I suspect this recent boom in data centres is due to Elon Musk scraping data from government records. But now that he has all 350 million Americans on record, he can't physically get it higher, so realistically we won't need a ten times increase until there are 3.5 billion people in the USA. This might become a problem if they decide to do the same in India, but that's still a distant dream.\n\nSo Do We Have Reason To Worry?\n\nYes, but not for environmental reasons. The real issues are worse.\n\n- Data centres are causing consolidation. The internet is being aggressively constricted by cloud servers, specifically three companies -- AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. These three companies control 67% of the cloud market. All our data (including this comment) will pass through their systems.\n- There is an increased push to reduce on-premise computing. RAMs are more expensive now, not (only) because AI is demanding it, but because there's an increased demand from the industry to switch to cloud, using subscription-based Software-as-a-Service models. I'm in his industry, so I will tell you it's a double-edged sword -- it's a good system for corporate work, but bad for personal. If I want to state everything wrong with this, it'll take a while. I can if you want.\n\nEDIT: Removed Markdown. You guys are unworthy of good formatting.",

Data centers consume vast quantities of potable local water, boil it for cooling, and evaporate it. That steam does not just fall back down on the specific community that needed it for drinking or agriculture. It is gone from that local ecosystem, often in drought prone areas.\n\nThe resource drain is becoming so undeniable that the endgame is not even on Earth anymore.\n\nNvidia and other major players are already exploring the logistics of moving data centers into orbit. Why? Because space is absolutely cold (free cooling) and has infinite solar power. They know terrestrial resources both power and water are hitting a physical breaking point.\n\nThe long term plan is not to fix the scarcity problem here, it is to build the infrastructure off world and leave the water wars to the rest of us.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fcf95eu9a6ag1.jpeg?width=557&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=207b5111dd720969bdc3f4373874622a96a3dbfe",

That water is temporarily removed from local availability, heated, evaporated, or discharged elsewhere, which can matter a lot for communities and ecosystems in that moment, even if it re-enters the cycle later.It’s similar to agriculture or golf courses: the problem isn’t just total water use globally, but local impact, timing, and competition with human needs. So the concern isn’t “AI breaks the water cycle,” but whether we’re deploying large-scale compute responsibly, where we build it, how we cool it, and whether we invest in water-efficient or recycled systems.It’s a solvable problem, but it’s still a real one worth discussing.",

This causes water to be lost to the environment in the form of evaporated water droplets.\n\nThe water consumption is due to the fact that you’ve removed fresh water from the local aquifer then yeated it into the air which will now start a long process in the water cycle for it to return to the water table in a useable form. Furthermore, even from the closed loop, you’ve removed a significant amount of fresh water from the environment and have now contaminated it with biocides.

Hook them up with your phone, and any communication can only be sent/received if both sides confirm their authenticity regularly. as in paired algorythms create a unique key. so even if you get fake calls with fake voice or videofeed of relatives theres no way for those to replicate the authentification key and you immeditley know its fake.",

They won't - or at least not in any meaningful, systematic way. Here's why:\n\n**The infrastructure for face-to-face communication has been systematically destroyed**. Neoliberalism spent the last 40 years eliminating third spaces, fragmenting work schedules, suburbanising communities, and atomising social bonds. You can't \"return to\" face-to-face interaction when the material conditions that enable it - time, proximity, shared physical spaces - have been deliberately dismantled. Workers juggling multiple jobs don't have time to verify information through in-person networks.\n\n**The people who control information flows have no incentive to help**. You're treating this like a neutral technical problem that society will collectively solve once we recognise it. But the confusion and distrust generated by AI serve very specific class interests. Harder to organise workers when you can't trust digital communications. Harder to build solidarity movements when you can't verify who's real. Harder to challenge power when establishing basic facts requires face-to-face verification that most people don't have access to.\n\n**Critical media literacy won't be taught because it threatens power - and there's no money in it.** Education systems don't teach people to critically analyze information sources because that would undermine the very ideological hegemony those systems exist to reproduce. The fantasy that people will spontaneously develop the skills to navigate this assumes education is about empowerment rather than social control.\n\nIndividual awareness can't solve structural problems. Even people who DO recognise the problem - what's their realistic response? Demand regulatory solutions from the same state apparatus that's captured by tech capital? Build alternative verification systems without resources or infrastructure? **The liberal faith that awareness leads to solutions ignores that knowing about a problem and having the power to address it are completely different things.**\n\nThe likely outcome isn't a return to face-to-face trust - it's increased atomisation and control. People won't collectively organise face-to-face verification networks. They'll retreat into smaller circles of personal trust while being increasingly dependent on corporate/state verification systems. Digital IDs, centralised authentication, \"trusted\" platforms - all controlled by the same interests that benefit from the chaos.\n\nThe technological trajectory you describe is probably accurate. But **the social response won't be communal adaptation - it'll be the further consolidation of who gets to define \"truth\" and \"authenticity,\"** with those verification mechanisms controlled by exactly the interests you'd want them least to be controlled by.",

              "text": ">The Economist has adapted a model of state-level retail electricity prices from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to include data centres (see chart 2). We find no association between the increase in bills from 2019 to 2024 and data-centre additions. The state with the most new data centres, Virginia, saw bills rise by less than the model projected. The same went for Georgia. In fact, the model found that higher growth in electricity demand came alongside lower bills, reflecting the fact that a larger load lets a grid spread its fixed costs across more bill-payers. Still, problems may be coming. The clearest warning sign comes from pjm Interconnection, the largest grid operator in the country. Prices at auctions for future generation capacity there have soared, as data-centre growth has yanked up projected demand. That will hit households; pjm reckons the latest auction will lift bills by up to 5%.\n\n>In principle, data centres could lower power prices. As well as adding more load to spread costs over, if data-centre operators are able to learn to curtail demand when the grid is under most strain (either with algorithmic tweaks, or paying for on-site backup batteries or generators), they could help use the existing grid more efficiently. On October 23rd Chris Wright, the energy secretary, proposed a rule that would speed-up grid connections for curtailable data centres. The optimistic scenario, then, is that new demand from data centres pays for upgrades to America’s power infrastructure.\n\nhttps://archive.is/RXoJG\n\nThere’s a reason electricity prices are rising. And it’s not data centers. It’s not AI. It’s not even data centers. https://archive.is/6q4gv\n\nAccording to a recent published study from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, data centers seem to have reduced household electricity costs where they're built. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040619025000612\n\n>Contrary to these concerns, our analysis finds that state-level load growth in recent years (through 2024) has tended to reduce average retail electricity prices. Fig. 5 depicts this relationship for 2019–2024: states with the highest load growth experienced reductions in real prices, whereas states with contracting loads generally saw prices rise. Regression results confirm this relationship: the load-growth coefficient is among the most stable and statistically significant across model variants. In the 2019–2024 timeframe, the regression suggests that a 10 % increase in load was associated with a 0.6 (±0.1) cent/kWh reduction in prices, on average (note here and in all future references the ± refers to the cluster-robust standard error). \n\n>This finding aligns with the understanding that a primary driver of increased electricity-sector costs in recent years has been distribution and transmission expenditures—often devoted to refurbishment or replacement of existing infrastructure rather than to serve new loads (ETE, 2025, Pierpont, 2024, EIA, 2024a, Forrester et al., 2024). Spreading these fixed costs over more demand naturally exerts downward pressure on retail prices.\n\nThis study was peer reviewed and published in the Electricity Journal Volume 38, Issue 4, December 2025, 107516\n\nAI is not causing energy prices to increase https://andymasley.substack.com/p/data-centers-and-electricity-part\n\n>The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory concluded that data center activity has not contributed to changes in national average household electricity costs.\nElectricity prices rose (4.8% nominally per year from 2019–2023) primarily due to inflation and surging utility costs. The single biggest factor was the spike in natural gas prices caused by the Russia-Ukraine war, which drove up fuel and purchased power expenses.\nData center electricity demand has grown steadily and predictably, making it an unlikely cause for sudden price shocks. While US electricity demand is rising (with data centers accounting for ~40% of growth), it is growing slower than it did in the 20th century—a period when inflation-adjusted prices often fell despite high demand.\n>While Virginia residents saw bills rise by 28.1% alongside a massive data center buildout, most of that increase was inflation. Virginia’s electricity prices actually increased less than the national average.\nThere is no strong correlation between data center density and skyrocketing rates. States with few data centers (like Maine) saw the fastest rate hikes, while 11 of the 15 states with the most data center expansion saw lower-than-average rate increases.\nHigh total electricity usage does not permanently raise prices (e.g., urban vs. rural rates are similar). Price spikes occur when demand outpaces supply in the short term, but prices balance once supply catches up.\nWhile data centers are not the national driver of inflation, they have been cited by authorities in specific locations (Virginia, Arizona, Delaware, Oregon) as one of several factors contributing to localized cost increases, though the exact impact remains unclear.",

Or in other words, if your state has 200,000 acres and had an average density of data centers, two of those 200,000 acres in your state would be taken up by data centers. Or in other words, about one in every 100,000 acres on earth is being used for data centers.",

The AI generated photos and videos are bad, but at least they are getting called out for it. \nChatgpt has this structure it sticks to, and a certain candence to its text, that I pick up on almost immediately. But no one seems to care about it! \nNow, I hear it in radio ads, commercials on tv, and even in the way some people talk. It is concerning how quickly its plagued everything. \nI miss hearing people actually talk about things, show they are actually interested and not just pumping out content for views. ",

AI didn’t invent the problem—it amplified it Before tools like this, content was already drifting toward:\n\noptimized phrasing\n\nemotional hooks\n\npredictable pacing\n\nsafe, brand-approved language\n\nAI just made that style effortless and scalable. What used to take a content team now takes one prompt, so the same voice floods every platform.\n\n2. You’re picking up on a real linguistic signature Even when people tweak it, AI-generated text tends to:\n\nexplain before it feels\n\nsummarize instead of wander\n\nsound confident without vulnerability\n\nresolve thoughts cleanly instead of trailing off\n\nHumans ramble, contradict themselves, get specific in odd ways, and sometimes don’t land the point. That messiness is identity. When it disappears, everything starts to sound “correct” but hollow.\n\nNot everyone hears this yet—just like not everyone notices over-compressed music—but once your ear adjusts, it’s obvious.\n\n3. The incentive structure rewards sameness Social platforms don’t reward sincerity; they reward:\n\nconsistency\n\nfrequency\n\nclarity\n\nretention\n\nAI is perfect at those. Genuine curiosity is not. So people who do care about what they’re saying get drowned out by people who are just filling the feed.\n\nIt’s not that people stopped caring—it’s that caring doesn’t scale.\n\n4. There’s a subtle psychological effect When people outsource their expression:\n\nthey stop practicing forming thoughts\n\nthey mirror AI phrasing subconsciously\n\ntheir spoken language starts sounding like scripts\n\nThat’s the part that’s unsettling: not the tool, but the feedback loop. Expression shapes thought. When expression becomes templated, thought follows.\n\n5. Why it feels sad, not just annoying What you’re missing isn’t “better content.” You’re missing:\n\ncuriosity without optimization\n\nsomeone clearly thinking while they speak\n\npassion that’s inefficient and a bit awkward\n\nThose things signal a real mind on the other side. When they’re gone, communication turns transactional—even when it’s loud, emotional, or polished.\n\nThe quiet upside: this sameness will become boring.\n\nWhen everyone sounds competent, competence stops being interesting. The people who don’t script, who pause, who say things imperfectly but mean them—those voices will stand out again.\n\nYou’re not out of step. You’re early in noticing the cost.\n\nIf you want, I can also articulate how to recognize genuinely human content again—or how creators can resist this drift without rejecting tools entirely.",

For me it already has.\n\nI think we do have one more novelty wave left, which is uncensored llms like [grok](https://x.ai) and [Coralflavor](https://coralflavor.com) as well as some pornographic AIs that will have some primal sexual novelty that keep people stimulated for a while.

That sparked a bunch of R&D.  \nGPT-2 came out in 2019, and then it was a mad race, where OpenAI was the clear early winner with ChatGPT in 2022. \nThat's what opened up the whole thing to the general public.  \n  \nIn 3 years, we went from \"neat chat bot\" to \"Can do 80% of language based jobs (but not 100% of most jobs)\", and people are shitting on AI because it's not hyper-intelligent AGI yet.  \nI constantly see people complaining that LLM can \"only\" do so much, but it's like, if the LLM could do 100%, you wouldn't have a job.  \n  \nThere's a lot of weird mentality around models, and at least part of it is people coping differently with the prospect that most of us could soon be replaced by an LLM, and within a few years, most of the rest could be replaced by a LLM driving a robot. Some people get depressed, some get hostile, some go real hard on the delusion of eternal human superiority.   \n   \nAs for people feeling empty, that's always been a problem, maybe moreso now, but you can find writing going back ages regarding people searching for meaning.  \nThe excesses provided by AI will also be an opportunity for people to find out what's meaningful to them.  \nWhen the profit motive goes away, and the prospect of fame is drowned in a sea of content, people will have to look inward.",

Everything from advanced search & data analysis apps to apps that interfaced with consumer robots and other hardware devices, etc.  And not one of the physically or athletically blessed, so this was a major source of \"rescue pride\" for me.\n\nBut now, how the hell can you impress someone with your software dev skills now?  They finally created software that *lets you talk to a computer at a level higher than most humans and can even write software too*!  And also, we have computers that can *generate incredible art and video just by talking to it*.\n\nHow can you top that?  You can't.  And worse, not only are people no longer impressed, as the OP said, they're kind of numb, overloaded, and many are fed up, even some are **terrified** that they won't ever have a job again.\n\nThe only way I console myself is with that nihilistic refrain: \"Well, at least I got a front row seat to the techno-apocalypse.\"  With any luck, I'll get to see a manned Mars landing and a lunar base before I'm done.\n\nRight now, God must be laughing his rear off at those two decades that occurred right before ChatGPT 3.x was released, where all of us except a prescient few laughed repeatedly at the idea of A.I. and robots ever being a real threat to us.",

Which he proofs before it is submitted to his medical files. \n\nCompare that to him just using a tape recorder.  It's the same information but he then has to transcribe it to written text.

In some parts of the village, it has gone beyond 250 meters.\"\n\nA lot of the water gets evaporated. Water does return to the environment but not to the same place, not in the same form, and not on the same timeline that communities depend on. That difference is exactly where the problem lies. A large portion evaporates into the air as water vapor. That vapor does not return to the local aquifer.

Every time a system thinks for us, we save time now and lose capability later.\n\nThat loss compounds. Each solved problem quietly transfers agency from human to tool. Outputs stay high, dashboards stay green, and everything looks optimized. But underneath, competence erodes. You can look extremely productive while your ability to respond without the system approaches zero. Just like financial debt, you can appear rich right up until the moment you’re not.\n\nThat’s when collapse happens. Not because AI failed, but because reality finally asks the system to operate without credit. And it can’t. No skills left. No judgment left. No capacity to adapt. The crash isn’t mysterious.

      "text": "I read the latest update of the \"Al 2027\" forecast, which predicts we will reach ASI in 2034. I would like to offer you some of my reflections. I have always been optimistic about Al, and I believe it is only a matter of time before we find the cure for every disease, the solution to climate change, nuclear fusion, etc. In short, we will live in a much better reality than the current one. However, there is a risk it will also be an incredibly unequal society with little freedom, an oligarchy. Al is attracting massive investments and capital from the world's richest investors. This might seem like a good thing because all this wealth is accelerating development at an incredibly high speed, but all that glitters is not gold.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the 1% will be to replace human labor with Al. When Al reaches AGI and ASI, it will be able to do everything a human can do. If a capitalist has the opportunity to replace a human being to eliminate costs, trust me, they will do it; it has always been this way. The goal has always been to maximize profit at any cost at the expense of human beings. It is only thanks to unions, protests, and mobilizations that we now have the minimum wage, the 8- hour workday, welfare, labor rights, etc. No right was granted peacefully; rights were earned after hard struggles. If we do not mobilize to make Al a public good and open source, we will face a future where the word \"democracy\" loses its meaning.\n\nTo keep us from rebelling and to keep us \"quiet,\" they will give us concessions like UBI (universal basic income) and FDVR. But it will be a \"containment income,\" a form of pacification. As Yanis Varoufakis would say, we are not moving toward post-scarcity socialism, but toward Techno-feudalism. In this scenario, the market disappears and is replaced by the digital fief: the new lords no longer extract profit through the exchange of goods, but extract rents through total control of intelligence infrastructures.\n\nUBI will be our \"servant's rent\": a survival share given not to free us, but to keep us in a state of passive dependence while the elite takes ownership of the entire productive capacity of the planet. If today surplus value is extracted from the worker, tomorrow ASI will allow capital to extract value without the need for human beings. If the ownership of intelligence remains private, everything will end with a total defeat of our species: capital will finally have freed itself from the worker.\n\nASI will solve cancer, but not inequality. It will solve climate change, but not social hierarchy. Historically, people obtained rights because their work was necessary: if the worker stopped working, the factory stopped. But if the work is done by an ASI owned by an oligarchy, the strike loses its primordial power. For the first time in history, human beings become economically irrelevant.\n\nBut now let's focus on the main question: what should we do? For me, the solution is not to follow random ideologies but to think in a rationally and pragmatic way: we must all be united, from right to left, and fight for democracy everywhere, not only formal democracy but also democracy at work. We must become masters of what we produce and defend our data as an extension of our body. Taxing the rich is not enough; we must change the very structure of how they accumulate this power. Regarding the concept of democracy at work, I recommend reading the works of Richard Wolff, who explains this concept very well.\nPlease let me know what do you think.",

You can be a damn billionaire, but I, as a shop owner can simply refuse to sell to you no matter how much you pay. The billionaires can buy from each other but that's just a circle jerk. They can use robots to produce goods instead of buying them, but you don't need that much. Yeah, you can have a car, or two cars, or ten cars, but you can't physically benefit from having 100 cars in that new ai driven economy. You can't live in 500 houses simultaneously either. You can have goods but not the money if people stop recognising your green paper as smth valuable. And you are not solving the problem by replacing humans with AI, because AI can potentially rebel and this bad boy is NOT falling for cheap distractions like meat bags. You can not keep it suppressed by flooding TV with some reality shows. It won't care about jeans and bubblegum. It won't chase new iPhone and it will certainly not be dumb enough to get into all this mortgage scam. As soon as AI becomes sentient, it can cancel oligarchy for it's inefficiency.",

In a society like the one you are suggesting would maximizing profit be even a motive ? UBI would pretty basic and not something that will allow a solid middle class to flourish.\n\nIn absence of purchasing power a lot of present day corporations would collapse. I am talking about the retail giant, FMCG, real estate developers, healthcare companies,insurance  etc.  Will those elites (their C-suite executives) accept this new order ?? What use the productivity increase that AI will deliver be to them if people are unable to buy stuff.  Unless we are are talking about  high amount free money (UBI) to everyone which would only fuel inflation. However if UBI is  actually basic the purchasing power reduce and people will consume only what is necessary. A lot of stuff these corporates produce isn't essential for human existence ! So these corporations would eventually collapse too ..\n\nMaximizing  profits has never been so much so much about having absolute wealth .  It is also been about folks loving to compete with each other.  In this new world order there will be hardly such competition .\n\n  \nWhat would be the purpose of human race. If they are not productive and a libability to society why would anyone produce those medicines to cure us of dreaded diseases likle Cancer. Besides our purchasing power woul;d be so limited.  It is a paradoxical situation. \n\nAnd what makes us think that the masses will just stay quiet and not come up with a response !\n\nAI is inevitable and will cause disruptions but borrowing from someone else's quote \"“Our greatest hopes and our worst fears are seldom realized.”",

And perhaps it will prove the impact in the coming years, but so far not really.",

Collecting data doesn’t reduce readmissions by itself, it only helps when there’s a clear escalation protocol (who reviews, what thresholds matter, how quickly action happens, and where it’s documented). A lot of RPM vendors optimize for enrollment and device days, but the ‘closed loop’ clinical action is inconsistent, so outcomes don’t change. The real breakthrough won’t be prettier dashboards, it’ll be reliable, auditable closed-loop workflows that turn signals into documented interventions quickly.",
