      "text": "OpenAI hit \"Code Red\" in December after Google's Gemini 3 started dominating benchmarks and user growth, forcing teams to drop everything and scramble to catch up.\n\nTraffic dipped month-over-month in late 2025 (second decline of the year), while Gemini surged to 650M+ monthly active users; even Salesforce's CEO publicly switched after a quick test.\n\nMicrosoft's filings show OpenAI lost \\~$12B in a single quarter; projections point to $143B cumulative losses before profitability — no startup has ever bled this much; Sora video gen alone costs $15M/day and is called \"completely unsustainable\" even internally.\n\nScaling laws are brutal now: 2x better models need 5x+ compute/energy/data centers; 2025 training runs reportedly failed to beat prior versions despite huge resources.\n\nHyped as making GPT-4 \"mildly embarrassing,\" but users called it underwhelming, worse at basics like math/geography, too robotic/safe/corporate; OpenAI rolled back to GPT-4o in \\~24 hours due to backlash, then dropped incremental .1/.2 updates with the same complaints.\n\nKey exits include: \n\nCTO Mira Murati, Chief Research Officer \n\nBob McGrew, Chief Scientist \n\nIlya Sutskever, President \n\nGreg Brockman, and half the AI safety team; some cited toxic leadership under Altman.\n\nSeeking up to $134B; federal judge ruled it heads to jury trial (set for early 2026), citing evidence OpenAI broke nonprofit promises Musk funded with $38M early on.\n\nNeeds \\~$200B annual revenue by 2030 (15x growth) amid exploding costs; Altman himself warned investors are overexcited and \"someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money.\"\n\nAI bubble peaking with competitors closing in, lawsuits mounting, and fundamentals ignored at $500B valuation; smart move might be exiting hype plays, trimming Mag7 AI bets, and rotating to undervalued small/mid-caps with real earnings.\n\nThoughts? Is this the start of the AI winter we've been warned about, or is it just growing pains for the leader? 🚀💥",

These are intelligent and educated people, which really throws me off because they have to, at some point, realize that their white collar tech job is one of the first to go. Since they don’t seem worried, at all, then it leads me to believe that they must be lying, especially about their timeline. AI isn’t coming for the majority of white collar jobs anytime soon. \n\nBig obstacles are heading at the industry, as OP mentioned. Then there’s the fact that people are quickly becoming aware that having an AI server farm in your city is not something you want. The noise alone is unbearable and physically disabling, which makes your property worthless and your health compromised. I guess that’s great for the farm, because they can then buy your property at pennies on the dollar, in order to expand their farm. Rinse and repeat. \n\nCan’t forget about the water supply they need and, industry being what it is, the pollution and environmental impact that will happen. \n\nEnergy usage/supply is another obstacle when they raise prices for everyone else. \n\nHopefully solutions to these issues can be discovered because I appreciate AI, for the most part, because it’s free. If I had to pay for it, I would rarely use it. ",

          "text": "This thread is spicy for a reason, but it’s also mixing three very different things into one “OpenAI is doomed” narrative - tech limits, business math, and vibes. Let me poke at all three a bit.\n\nFirst, a lot of the numbers being thrown around might be directionally true but they’re being interpreted like OpenAI is a normal startup. It isn’t. This is closer to early AWS than WeWork. AWS lost money for years while Amazon lit cash on fire building infra no one else wanted to pay for yet. Same pattern here: OpenAI is front-loading the most expensive part of the curve (training + inference at scale) before enterprise pricing, regulation moats, and distribution fully kick in. That doesn’t mean it can’t fail - just that “losing $X per quarter” on its own isn’t a death sentence.\n\nSecond, the “Gemini is winning because it’s bundled” argument cuts both ways. Bundling wins short-term MAUs, not necessarily mindshare or platform gravity. Internet Explorer had the bundle. Chrome won the developers. Right now ChatGPT is still the verb. That matters more than Reddit wants to admit. If OpenAI turns that verb into workflows (agents, memory, internal tools, enterprise copilots), the revenue math changes fast. If they don’t, then yeah - BlackBerry comparisons start to feel earned.\n\nOn the exec exits: this is the strongest bearish signal IMO, but people are over-romanticizing it. Frontier labs are inherently unstable. The moment you shift from “pure research lab” to “global product + gov relationships + $10B infra decisions,” you will lose researchers who hate that world. That’s not automatically “rats fleeing,” it’s often “wrong personality for the phase.” The real red flag would be research stagnation plus talent drain plus declining usage. We don’t have all three yet.\n\nWhere I do agree with OP: scaling laws are getting ugly, and OpenAI is the most exposed because they set the pace. Being first means you pay the most tuition. Google can wait, copy, and amortize across Search, Ads, Android, and TPU. OpenAI doesn’t have that luxury. If on-device models reach “good enough” faster than expected, cloud-first players get squeezed hard.\n\nSo no, I don’t think this is an AI winter. The tech is too useful, and adoption is too real. But could OpenAI specifically end up being the company that proved it was possible, but not the one that captured the most value? Absolutely. History is full of those.\n\nThe real question isn’t “will OpenAI fail?”\nIt’s: will they become an infra layer, a product company, or an acquisition?\nBecause only one of those justifies the current narrative - and they’re running out of time to choose.",

The $15M/day on Sora is genuinely insane when you realize most users just make 5-second memes and dip. That's not a product, that's a money incinerator with a nice UI.\n\nThe GPT-5 rollback situation was *chef's kiss*. Hyped it for a year as the model that would \"change everything,\" dropped it, users immediately noticed it couldn't do basic geography, and they panic-reverted in 24 hours. If that doesn't scream \"we have no idea what we're doing anymore\" idk what does.\n\nAnd the executive exodus? When your CTO, Chief Research Officer, AND the guy who literally invented your core tech (Ilya) all leave within months... that's not \"normal turnover.\" That's rats leaving a sinking ship energy.\n\nHere's the thing people miss though: **OpenAI isn't really an AI company anymore. It's a hype machine that happens to have AI.** Sam's been doing more podcasts and congressional hearings than actual research. Meanwhile Anthropic and Google are just... shipping.\n\nThe $500B valuation at -$12B/quarter means they need to 15x revenue while compute costs are still exponential. The math doesn't math.\n\nNot saying \"AI winter\" yet — the tech is real — but OpenAI specifically might become the WeWork of this cycle. First mover advantage only works if you can actually sustain it.\n\n*grabs popcorn* 🍿",

Not “AI no longer works,” but “AI is becoming a problem of heavy engineering and brutal business,” not a magic hack.\n\n\nRegarding OpenAI in particular, I get the impression they're paying the price for:\n\n• their leading position (everyone compares them, no one forgives them),\n\n• and a complicated transition from research to consumer product to cash cow.\n\nThe feedback about them being \"too robotic/corporate\" is also interesting: technically, they're progressing, but in terms of user experience, there might be stagnation, or even regression. And benchmarks don't capture that.\n\n\nSo for me:\n\n• not an AI winter in the 2010 sense,\n\n• but probably the end of the \"free money + hype + naive scaling\" phase.\n\nThe question I'm asking myself is:\n\nWill the next wave of innovation come from new giant models, or from more refined, more human, better integrated—but less spectacular—uses?\n\nCurious to know what you think will be the next real differentiator: raw performance, cost, or user experience?",

Losses do not equal failure when you’re building infrastructure that did not exist before. AWS bled for years too.\n\nThat said, the warning signs are not imaginary:\n-Costs are exploding faster than capabilities\n-Leadership churn + legal pressure is not nothing\n-Incremental model gains do feel underwhelming lately\n\nI don’t buy “biggest failure in history,” but I do buy that the hype curve ran ahead of the fundamentals. This does not feel like AI winter yet instead more like a reality check phase where easy gains are gone and only disciplined players survive.\n\nTL;DR: Not winter, but definitely the end of the free-money, infinite-upside era.

      "text": "been thinking about this after watching a recent cnbc piece.\n\nZhipu AI (chinese lab, just IPO'd in hong kong) had to cap subscriptions on their GLM-4.7 coding model cause too many people were using it. normal story right? except their user base is primarily concentrated in the United States and China, then followed by india, japan, brazil, uk.\n\nlet that sink in. american developers, people who have access to gpt, claude, copilot, cursor, are choosing a chinese open source model in big enough numbers to crash their servers.\n\nUS labs: build the best possible model → close it off → charge premium → protect IP → maximize margin\n\nChinese labs: build a good enough model → open source it → price it dirt cheap → get massive adoption → ???\n\nGLM-4.7 sits at #6 on code arena leaderboards rn. its open source. and apparently its good enough that US devs are actually using it for real work, not just testing.\n\nif looking at the open source leaderboards, 7 of the top 10 models are chinese. this isnt \"catching up\" anymore. theyre leading in open source while we re going more closed.\n\nif you can build a 90% solution for 10% of the cost and make it open source so anyone can customize it, does the proprietary 100% solution even matter for most use cases?\n\nchinese AI strategy seems to be \"practical application over cutting edge.\" theyre not trying to build AGI or win benchmarks. theyre building tools that work well enough, pricing them so everyone uses them, and integrating them into actual production workflows.\n\nmeanwhile US companies are in this weird arms race to build the \"most advanced\" model while charging more and locking it down tighter. then acting surprised when developers look elsewhere lol\n\nif this trend continues, chinese models dominating open source + being actually good + US developers adopting them, what does that mean for the US AI ecosystem longterm?\n\ndo we end up with bifurcated AI development where:\n\nconsumer AI = closed US models (chatgpt, claude)\n\ndeveloper tools / production systems = open chinese models (GLM, deepseek, etc)\n\ncause thats kinda what the usage patterns are showing right now.\n\nanyone here actually using GLM-4.7 for coding work? not benchmarks, like actual production use. hows it compare to what you were using before?\n\ncause if its genuinely good enough + way cheaper + open source, seems like the logical choice unless your locked into an existing stack. and maybe thats the whole point.",

      "text": "AI companies seem to be figuring out what actually matters. And it’s not just the models. \n\nReddit stock hit $257 this week. Up 400% since IPO. Some analyst said it's going to $320. Another 30% from here.\n\nbut Everyone's asking why..!? The answer is almost embarrassing for the AI industry.\n\nChatGPT, Gemini and Claude all cite Reddit constantly. Like every third answer has \"according to discussions on Reddit\" or links to some thread from 2019 where a guy solved the exact problem you're asking about. There's also a meme going around. \"The biggest technological achievement of the 2020s is an AI that can find the Reddit comment a random person wrote in 2015.\" And it's kinda true :)\n\nWe spent $1 trillion building these models. Entire data centers. Billions of parameters. Cutting edge research. And the most valuable thing they do is point you to what some human already said.\n\nReddit didn't build any AI. They don't have a research lab. No PhD engineers working on transformers. They just have a website where people talk to each other. That's it.\n\nWhile Google spent $70 billion on AI and Microsoft spent $80 billion and Meta spent god knows how much. Reddit just kept the servers running and let people argue about whether the new iPhone is worth it.\n\nNow those billion dollar models need Reddit to sound credible.\n\nGoogle's paying Reddit $60 million a year for training data. OpenAI has a similar deal. Reddit made $1.3 billion in 2025 partly from these licensing agreements. Just from letting AI companies scrape conversations people had for free.\n\nthe funny thing is We built AI to replace humans. To automate knowledge work. To make human expertise obsolete. Turns out the most valuable thing in the AI era is authentic human conversation. The messy unfiltered stuff where someone who actually used the product tells you if it sucks or not.\n\nPerfect loop. Humans talk. AI learns. Humans visit to see what AI cited. Talk more. Repeat.",

I've used Claude for instance to gather some sources for a paper I worked on regarding consulting, when insisting on the sources, you usually get a lot of McKinsey, Accenture, Deloitte and so on, which is.. pretty spot on?\n\nNaturally you'd have to be aware that referencing consulting firms for consulting statements can have its own bias, but it's a far cry from just being a random reddit source, unless I ask obscure stuff or something that doesn't have a lot of science/\"facts\" behind it, I rarely have it lead me to reddit.\n\nThough this might depend on what your use case for it is in the first place.",

Businesses, IP, distribution, audiences, equity, whatever. AI makes them more productive, cuts their costs, and lets them scale way faster than before.\n\nOn the bottom arm: people who trade their time to solve problems. And here's the part nobody really wants to admit - AI is shrinking the number of problems that actually need a human to solve them.\n\nNot down to zero. But fewer. And way more competitive.\n\nRight now, you can still move between the two. You can still build a small SaaS, control a niche workflow, own an audience, create some kind of leverage instead of just trading hours for money.\n\nBut I don't think that window stays open forever.\n\nMy guess is that the next 5 years or so matter way more than people realize. After that, the gap hardens. Not because people get lazy or stop trying, but because AI drops the cost of execution to basically nothing, capital and distribution start to dominate everything, and asset owners just keep compounding while everyone else fights over scraps.\n\nThis isn't some doomer take. It's just economics 101.\n\nI'm not saying everyone needs to be a billionaire. But relying purely on selling your time feels riskier every year from here.\n\nI'm interested in how others are thinking about this. Is the K-shape inevitable? Or does AI actually reopen mobility long-term? And if you disagree, where do you think new value comes from for people who don't own assets?\n\nGenuinely want to hear counter-arguments.",

Models are already way cheaper than two years ago, and open source keeps closing the gap. Even if frontier labs burn out, the tech doesn’t disappear.\n\nMaybe I’m wrong about timing, but if execution costs keep falling while distribution and capital stay expensive, the dynamic still tilts toward ownership over labor. Though yeah, if AI just hits a wall, none of this happens.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

It needs a lot of \"hand holding\", unless you scaffold and give it a proper framework, which means you need to keep a tight \"game plan\", a master plan for your project, follow it like a military drill, don't vibe to much and don't deviate from the framework too much, you can always add \"modules\" later on, as long as your framework holds up (kinda like a house with good foundation), you'll be fine.\n\nJuniors will desperately be needed, I know - because I've hired them myself in our company, and they ALWAYS have to learn the basics properly and not \"cheat\" too much, if you cheat too much (even if you get away with it) and have NO clue what you're doing, then we're screwed!",

Staying invested in the companies that win the transition is probably the safest play for people who already have assets.\n\nThe college thing is interesting too. I hadn’t thought about it as gatekeeping, but you’re right - if access tightens and it becomes a signaling mechanism again instead of just a checkbox, then it might actually regain value. Especially if the “thinker class” becomes more insulated from automation than everyone else.\n\nI’ll check out that book - sounds like exactly the kind of perspective that’s useful right now. The people who navigate these transitions well aren’t usually the ones predicting doom or euphoria, they’re the ones just making smart, boring decisions and protecting what they have.\n\nAppreciate you sharing this. It’s a more grounded version of the same concern, and probably the right playbook if you’re already on the right side of the divide.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

That's not \"thinking\" the way we do, but it's also not just autocomplete. It's somewhere in between - not sentient, but functionally useful in ways that matter.\n\nWhere I think you're right is that embodied tasks like robotics might actually be where this gets more reliable, because the constraints are clearer and the feedback loops are tighter. Knowledge work is messy and harder to validate.\n\nBut even if AI doesn't hit AGI or stalls out at \"pretty good automation,\" I think the economic impact still happens. You don't need full intelligence to displace jobs or shift leverage toward capital. Just \"good enough\" might be enough to tilt things.\n\nSo yeah, could be a bubble.

The result is a like a compounding effect. Unsurprisingly, many CEOs, financiers, politicians, and physicians are drawn from the top decile to begin with, and they tend to reproduce that status by leveraging the advantages they already have.\n\nIt’s already impossible to work yourself up in most societies.",

AI executes instructions inside constraints humans define. That’s not asset-ownership magic, that’s just tooling.\n\nEvery productivity revolution has followed this same pattern. Spreadsheets didn’t eliminate accountants, they raised expectations. CAD didn’t eliminate engineers, it raised complexity. Automation didn’t eliminate manufacturing work, it shifted skill demand. AI is the same thing, just louder.\n\nThe whole “bottom arm” framing assumes value only comes from ownership, that labor is static, and that demand is fixed. None of that is true.\n\nWhen execution gets cheaper, people don’t want less. They want more. More customization, more speed, more integration, more compliance, more interpretation, more handling of edge cases. That creates new problems faster than old ones disappear, and those problems still require humans.\n\nThe idea that capital and distribution will dominate everything also ignores reality. Distribution itself is getting commoditized. Attention fragments faster than capital compounds. Trust, judgment, taste, accountability, and context do not scale infinitely.\n\nOwning assets has always compounded better than selling time. That’s not AI. That’s been true for thousands of years.\n\nWhat is new is that the cost of building leverage is lower than ever. Barriers to entry for ownership keep dropping. One person can now do what used to require teams. That’s not a closing window. That’s a widening one.\n\nThis isn’t economics 101. It’s vibes, LinkedIn fear, and a misunderstanding of how tools change labor markets.\n\nAI doesn’t replace people who solve problems. It replaces people who only execute without judgment.\n\nIf you think selling time is dead, you’ve never met a good nurse, a good mechanic, a good operator, a good salesperson, or a good manager.\n\nAI didn’t end leverage.

That power isn’t the same as being rich, but it’s also not nothing.\n\nI don’t think most people end up permanently unemployed overnight. It’s more likely a long grind where roles keep getting hollowed out unless you move closer to leverage, coordination, or control.

I can run 30B models, and some of them are actually pretty good although a lot of them still suffer from coherence issues. It's just that I can only offload about 40% of said model to the GPU, and although they can start out at a reasonable speed (like 8 tokens per second) they very quickly slow down as the context window fills up—and that's with a fairly small context window like 40960 tokens.\n\nThis makes them fun to just chat with, and they make decent writing assistants, but the problem of context limits the functionality in the latter role. I've tried 4B, 8B, and 14B models and they're just not smart enough to do the job. I've also tried 70B models (very slowly) and found some of \\*them\\* are kinda stupid too, so I think I've found a sweet spot with `Qwen3-30B-A3B-abliterated-erotic.i1-Q4_K_M`from mradermacher.

Unless you are a billionaire at this point, you are screwed.\n\n> On the top arm: people who own stuff. Businesses, IP, distribution, audiences, equity, whatever. AI makes them more productive, cuts their costs, and lets them scale way faster than before.\n\n> On the bottom arm: people who trade their time to solve problems. And here's the part nobody really wants to admit - AI is shrinking the number of problems that actually need a human to solve them.\n\nMost \"top arm\" people are not as safe as you believe. Most of them rely on the \"bottom arm\" people for generating revenue. Very few of them can exist in a demand-vacuum (which is the race-to-the-bottom scenario of layoffs and efficiency increases you are talking about), and they will be forced to exit as the economy (or what is left of it anyway) turns into a heap of supply no one can afford. Again, some companies will be able to survive, although with considerably less total revenue, but most will go under.\n\n> Right now, you can still move between the two. You can still build a small SaaS, control a niche workflow, own an audience, create some kind of leverage instead of just trading hours for money.\n\nNo, you can't. You have deluded yourself into thinking you can, though. If the barrier to entry becomes effectively zero with AI it means two things: (1) anyone can do it, so expect 10000 Indians doing the same thing you are doing, undercutting you indefinitely and (2) companies and customers will be able to do any and all SaaS products in-house, meaning the SaaS you are building is living on borrowed time. You might be able to suck a few years out of it, but it's never going anywhere because the AI-tools you are leveraging to build whatever service can be done by anyone else.\n\n> My guess is that the next 5 years or so matter way more than people realize. After that, the gap hardens. Not because people get lazy or stop trying, but because AI drops the cost of execution to basically nothing, capital and distribution start to dominate everything, and asset owners just keep compounding while everyone else fights over scraps.\n\nTrue, and good luck outbidding Google, Meta or Amazon for hosting your SaaS. What happens when these companies effectively monopolize the hosting infrastructure through outpricing every independent actor? You will fight over scraps, indeed. But these will be scraps of food, not some imaginary market share. We are heading into dystopia where like 5 companies will own and host all of the worlds software, and you will be unable to outcompete them in any way as they have more capital than you can even imagine.\n\n> I'm not saying everyone needs to be a billionaire. But relying purely on selling your time feels riskier every year from here.\n\nUnless you directly own a considerable amount of AI infrastructure (see datacenters, not some fucking PC in a basement somewhere), directly work with development of AI in some way that cannot be done by AI itself, power AI (electricity field) or extract resources used for AI and robotics then you are fucked.\n\n> Or does AI actually reopen mobility long-term?\n\nNo, AI is the re-feudalization and permanent stratification of the social classes. You will either be a have or a have-not, and your children (assuming we are not killed off) will suffer the same fate. A SaaS will not rescue you from that fate. There are a lot of people on reddit (/r/accelerate & /r/singularity) that are actually excited about this, believe it or not! I would imagine most of these people being billionaires, based on how much they are looking forward to it!\n\n> And if you disagree, where do you think new value comes from for people who don't own assets?\n\nSkills directly related to the survival of you, your family and community. Growing, storing and preparing food. Healthcare.\n\nAlso this entire post is likely AI-generated, maybe in some diffuse effort of advertising the SaaS that this 1 month old account is apparently building. Not subtle.",

Saying \"unless you're a billionaire you're already screwed\" is just as much of an assumption as me saying there's still 5 years left. The reality is we don't actually know how this shakes out yet. Could be full re-feudalization. Could also be messier and slower with weird pockets of opportunity that last longer than either of us expect.\n\nOn the SaaS thing - yeah, if the barrier drops to zero then competition explodes and most things get commoditized. But \"most\" isn't \"all.\" There are still niches where trust, taste, or deep context matter enough that you can't just get undercut by a thousand clones. Not saying it's easy, just that it's not literally impossible.\n\nAs for the mega-corps owning all the infrastructure - probably true long-term, but we're not there yet. And even in that world, people still find ways to survive and build. It won't be pretty, but total lock-in assumes zero chaos, zero mistakes by the top, and zero new disruptions.

Smaller models are already way more capable with way less compute. If that keeps going, the cost problem might solve itself even if OpenAI goes under.\n\nAnd even if the hype crashes, the capabilities don’t disappear. Open source models already automate a ton of work and keep improving without billions in funding. So OpenAI dying might just kill this phase of AI, not the tech itself - and that might actually make wealth concentration worse, not better.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

The \"K-shape\" isn't new - it's how capitalism has always functioned. Capital accumulates, labour gets squeezed.\n\nAI doesn't change this dynamic - it intensifies it. Automation under capitalism means workers lose bargaining power and face unemployment, while capitalists extract more value with fewer workers. That's not a tech problem, **it's a class problem**.\n\nThe \"solution\" you're proposing - scramble to become a small asset owner before the window closes - is individualist fantasy. Most people can't build SaaS or \"own audiences.\" And even if they could, you're just proposing everyone become small-scale capitalists. That doesn't solve exploitation, it just moves you to the other side of it.\n\n**Here's the actual answer:** automation should liberate workers from toil. \n\nUnder socialism, AI means shorter workweeks and shared prosperity. \nUnder capitalism, it means unemployment and concentration of wealth.\n\nThe \"mobility\" you want doesn't come from individual escape. It comes from collective organisation - unions, tenant movements, socialist politics - that fights for workers to control the fruits of automation instead of letting capitalists hoard them.\n\nYou can't individually escape a class system.

You're right that it just moves you to the other side of the exploitation without fixing the system.\n\nWhere I get stuck is on the collective transformation part. I *want* to believe that unions, tenant movements, and socialist organizing can actually redistribute the gains from automation. But I'm genuinely uncertain whether labor has enough leverage left to force that when capital doesn't need workers anymore. Like historically, labor won concessions because strikes could halt production. What happens when production doesn't need labor?\n\nI'm not saying that means we give up on collective action - maybe it just means the fight has to look different. But I also don't know what that looks like in practice, and in the meantime people still have to survive.\n\nSo maybe the individual scramble is a dead-end, but I don't yet see the collective path clearly enough to tell people \"just organize and it'll work out.\" Not saying you're wrong, just that I'm stuck between knowing the system's broken and not seeing a clear route to fixing it before it locks in.\n\nAppreciate you laying this out clearly though.

If workers are unemployed, demand collapses. That's why even capitalists are floating UBI - they need markets.\n* Infrastructure workers - someone maintains the grid, builds the datacenters, delivers the packages. Automation displaces some labor, not all.\n* Social reproduction - care work, childcare, healthcare. These resist automation and remain essential.\n* The idea that 'automation will open up new job opportunities' is flawed when viewed as a solution to this problem, but it is a real thing too - there will be new jobs created to support automation (fewer, of course, than the jobs replaced by automation), engineers to install and repair the machines and so on. They still fundamentally rely on labour - no matter how much automation happens, somewhere down the line it comes down to a human's muscle and brainpower to make that happen **and the ongoing efforts of both to some degree.**\n\nLabour’s leverage shifts, but doesn't disappear. It becomes about controlling the infrastructure rather than just withholding production.\n\n**What organising looks like:**\n\n* Tenant unions fighting rent increases and demanding social housing - capital needs tenants, even if it doesn't need factory workers\n* Utility nationalisation campaigns - demand public ownership of AI infrastructure, energy grids, broadband\n* Universal basic services not UBI - free healthcare, transport, housing. Make survival independent of employment.\n* Worker control of automation - demands that displaced workers retrain into maintaining/controlling automated systems, not just get fired\n\nThe fight shifts from \"withhold labour to halt production\" to \"demand control over the systems capital created.\" Strike action still works where labour exists. Where it doesn't, it's about democratic control of automated production - who decides what gets made and who benefits?\n\n**On survival vs. transformation:**\n\nYou're right that people need to survive now. I'm not saying don't take the gig, don't learn the skill, don't try to improve your position. Survival strategies and collective organising aren't mutually exclusive - you can do both.\n\nWhat I'm saying is: don't mistake survival tactics for solutions. The individual scramble won't save most people, but it might buy time. Use that time to organise.\n\nThe path forward isn't perfectly clear - it never is before you walk it. But history shows: when workers organise around shared interests, they win concessions even from hostile systems. The specifics adapt to conditions. Right now, that means organising tenants, demanding public ownership of infrastructure, and building mutual aid networks.\n\nIt won't \"work out\" automatically. But collective action is the only thing that ever has worked. Individual escape is a lottery ticket.",

          "text": "I get why so many people are worried about AI creating a K-shaped economy, where a few asset owners win big and everyone else struggles. It’s a valid concern, and it’s easy to see how we could end up there if we’re not careful. But I’m not totally convinced that’s the only possible future. Here’s why I think there’s still hope for a different outcome.\n\nFor starters, AI isn’t just a tool for the wealthy or well-connected. It’s actually making it easier for regular people to create value without needing a ton of resources upfront. You don’t have to be a tech billionaire to use AI to build something, automate tasks, or even start a side hustle. The game isn’t rigged yet, it’s just changing fast, and those who adapt early might find themselves in a stronger position than they think.\n\nThen there’s the fact that AI isn’t great at everything. It can crunch numbers and generate content, but it can’t replace human creativity, judgment, or emotional intelligence. As AI takes over repetitive tasks, the things that make us uniquely human could become even more valuable. Maybe the future isn’t about owning assets versus selling time, but about finding smarter ways to combine the two.\n\nI also think we’re underestimating how AI could open up new opportunities. The internet already showed us that niche markets can be incredibly lucrative. AI might just make it easier to tap into those niches, whether you’re offering a specialized service, creating digital products, or building a community around a shared interest.\n\nAnd let’s be honest: the future isn’t set in stone. The way we design policies, share access to tools, and support innovation will play a huge role in how this all plays out. If we focus on making AI work for everyone, not just a select few, we might end up with a much more balanced economy than we’re fearing.\n\nSo, is the K-shape inevitable? I don’t think so. But it’s on us to make sure we’re building a future that works for as many people as possible. What’s your take, are we heading for a divide, or is there a path to something better?",

The optimistic case you're laying out isn't unrealistic.\n\nWhere I'm less convinced is on timing and scale. You're right that AI makes it easier to build stuff without huge upfront resources, but it also makes it easier for everyone else to do the same thing. So the question becomes: does lowering barriers create more opportunity, or does it just flood every niche with competition until margins collapse? I think it depends on how fast capabilities improve versus how fast new value gets discovered.\n\nOn the human skills thing - creativity, judgment, emotional intelligence - I agree those matter. I'm just not sure they'll command the same premium they used to. Being \"uniquely human\" might still be necessary, but if it's not scarce anymore because AI handles everything around it, does it actually pay well? Or does it just become table stakes?\n\nI want to believe policy and access can steer this toward a balanced outcome. But I'm skeptical that happens without serious pressure, because the incentives all point toward centralization. The people with capital and infrastructure don't give it up voluntarily.\n\nSo yeah, the K-shape isn't inevitable. But I think avoiding it requires intentional intervention, not just optimism that the tools will spread themselves evenly. Hope you're right though.",

The K-shape discourse is very \"what happens to software engineers\" and less \"what happens to the guy who's been delivering DoorDash since 2020 because nothing else worked out.\"\n\nAI could make the K worse by displacing the currently-employed into that pool. Or it could do the opposite - lower barriers to participation, enable new forms of work, let more people create value than the old system allowed.\n\nWhich one happens isn't economics 101. It's a policy choice. The K-shape is the default if nobody intervenes, but it's not the only possible outcome.\n\nThat said, I'm not exactly optimistic about which path we're currently on. We're speedrunning the bad ending and calling it innovation. But I've been wrong before. Usually about things that matter less than this, unfortunately.",

          "text": "The original post says you need to own businesses or assets to survive. That's not really true. You just need to find ways to work with AI so it makes you better at your job instead of replacing you.\n\nHere are three ways to do that:\n\nFirst, build expertise in areas where AI can't help much. AI knows a lot of general information. But it doesn't know the details about your town, your community, or your specific industry. You can become an expert in something very specific. Maybe you learn everything about the rules in your field. Maybe you understand your local culture better than anyone else. Maybe you know exactly what a small group of customers needs. AI can't copy this kind of knowledge. You become more valuable because AI handles the easy stuff and you handle the hard, specific stuff.\n\nSecond, work in jobs where people need other people. Some jobs exist because humans want to connect with other humans. Jobs like teaching, coaching, therapy, entertainment, and community leadership all depend on human connection. People want more than just answers to their problems. They want trust. They want someone who gets them. AI might help you do parts of these jobs faster. But it can't replace you because being human is the whole point. When everything else gets automated, the human touch might actually become more special.\n\nThird, get really good at using AI tools. Think of a conductor leading an orchestra. The conductor doesn't play the instruments. But the conductor knows how to bring everyone together to make beautiful music. You can do the same thing with AI. Learn how to use different AI tools together in smart ways. You become the person who knows how to make AI work for you. The AI is your helper, not your replacement.\n\nThe real question isn't \"do you own assets?\" The real question is \"are you learning skills that matter more when AI does the boring work?\"\n\nYou don't need to rush out and buy a business in the next five years. You need to figure out how to work with AI instead of against it. Find work where being human matters. Build knowledge that's special to you. Use AI as your assistant. That's how you stay valuable.",

That's technically true at the architecture level, but it undersells what's actually happening. Like, AlphaFold didn't just predict words, it solved protein folding in ways that advanced biology by years. Noyron's aerospike engine design - something NASA couldn't crack in 70 years - wasn't just autocomplete, it was genuine discovery.\n\nThese systems are finding patterns and solutions humans missed, even if the mechanism is probabilistic. That's not AGI, sure, but it's also not Teddy Ruxpin. It's somewhere in between - not sentient, but functionally useful in ways that go beyond summarization and email drafts.\n\nAnd yeah, the bubble might burst, OpenAI might collapse, the economics are broken right now. But even if that happens, the capabilities don't vanish. Open models keep improving, costs keep dropping, and the tools stick around even if the hype dies.\n\nAlso worth remembering - this is the *worst* AI will ever be from here. Even if progress slows, we're not going backward. So whether it's overhyped or not, the impact is real and probably growing.\n\nNot saying you're wrong to be skeptical, just that I think there's more signal here than just next-token prediction and marketing noise.",

Then not just electricity production, but transmission needs to be 3 or 4 times multiplied also, and that takes even longer. \n\nAfter you solve the energy problem, our current iteration of \"AI\" is almost never likely to attain AGI, let alone ASI. Many major players in the industry admit as much regularly. There are major structural hurdles to solve and probably a dozen steps along the way that will all require miraculous breakthroughs that each one alone could take decades, or may not even actually be possible at all (we don't know, we don't even have the energy AVAILABLE yet) many of these breakthroughs would require an entire full re think of the AI system we currently have, or a major breakthrough with fusion technology or the largest traditional nuclear plant build out in human history, times 10.\n\nAfter that, robotics needs to miraculously get about 100x better than it currently is. Even the latest generations of teslas robots still can't actively do probably 95% of human jobs aside from the most basic tasks (oh yeah, and these robots also run on electricity too, need more of that again I guess)\n\nAnd all of this assumes this massive investment boom in AI holds, permanently, for decades and decades without ever letting up. Investors typically aren't that patient. \n\nI agree that it's highly likely we will eventually automate away most jobs and have a major structural change, but this fantasy that there somehow won't be any more major hurdles or bumps along the road is naive.

But power and control, by its nature, involves other people, society. Tech oligarchs or other billionaires aren’t interested in having only the, say, 100, or 1000, richest people survive.

Many of these people are just normal people that have high paying jobs (think doctors, lawyers, engineers, etc.). Additionally, I would imagine (although I do not know for sure) that this 10% is very bottom heavy, i.e. its likely that the 10% of that 10% (i.e. the 1%) spend (proportionally) considerably less than the remaining 90%. There is a limit to how much you can really consume, and the ultra wealthy (so 1% and above) seem to always just store or hoard their wealth instead of going on consumer sprees.\n\nAll this to say that the majority of that 10% that do 50% of consumer spending will be very hurt by AI replacement. They are not billionaires a la Zuckerberg, building bunkers and compounds to shield themselves from the masses.

A consumer gets paid and pays rent, insurance, car payments, mortgages, daycare, food, clothes, heat, electricity, water, entertainment services, the occasional service (like car repair or handyman), etc. The list can effectively go on endlessly, but the core of it is that humans disburse their money in a very wide manner.\n\nAI does not spend money because it has none. It doesn't pay rent, doesn't need food or water, doesn't need a car, doesn't need daycare, doesn't need heat, doesn't need to get its car fixed or house fixed, and doesn't even have a mortgage. The \"money\" that \"AI\" has is the money that its company has. Sure, a company might instruct some AI system to \"Buy X and Y services from so-and-so company,\" but this is just shuffling money between companies. Eventually, that flow of money will concentrate itself to basically a handful of ever-increasingly tyrannical companies (think Google, Meta, Nvidia, and maybe some resource extraction and electricity companies). The economy will literally shrink as consumers gradually disappear from the market until only the few I mentioned are left. So this notion that \"AI will be the consumers!\" is, if you'll excuse my language, fucking retarded.",

It was said that the top 10% of earners are responsible for 50% of consumption, but to be a 10% earner you \"\"\"only\"\"\" need to earn like $200 000 yearly in the US. Many of these people are just normal people that have high paying jobs (think doctors, lawyers, engineers, etc.). Additionally, I would imagine (although I do not know for sure) that this 10% is very bottom heavy, i.e. its likely that the 10% of that 10% (i.e. the 1%) spend (proportionally) considerably less than the remaining 90%. There is a limit to how much you can really consume, and the ultra wealthy (so 1% and above) seem to always just store or hoard their wealth instead of going on consumer sprees.\n\nAll this to say that the majority of that 10% that do 50% of consumer spending will be very hurt by AI replacement. They are not billionaires a la Zuckerberg, building bunkers and compounds to shield themselves from the masses. They are normal people with well-paying careers that are just as susceptible to replacement as you and me.",

So it's not like the economy has to endure everyone become broke all at once.\n\nAnd you have to remember that a core feature of an AI-driven economy is that prices plummet. Any goods or services where the labor component can be replaced by AI and advanced robotics should face a price war with competitors as each is forced to sell at a lower price to compete with each other. So yes, large swaths of people will be losing their job, but this will happen in phases while, at the same time, prices on goods and services we need are plummeting.\n\nSo different folks will find different strategies. Some people are broke while working and they'll face difficulty early on. Others will have savings that will carry them fairly far. There will be a whole spectrum too. Also, people will, sometimes find success finding new work, at least for a while. So some people will have some resources, and they should go farther than you'd otherwise think given dropping prices.\n\nAdditionally, one of the things you'll be able to buy for cheap is robotic labor and AI intelligence. And you can use that to make money. So some people will be entrepreneurial and use some of their dwindling resources to set up AI and robotics-based businesses. They say necessity is the mother of invention, and lots of people being jobless while there's a glut of cheap labor available is a recipe for entrepreneurship. Some of these efforts will be successful, giving the new business owner a path forward in a new world.\n\nEventually, we will all have to find a way to transition to that world; a world where our labor is not valuable but that it's fairly easy to be the complete or partial owner of profitable businesses.",

AI is the promise that \"idea guys\" dont need serfs anymore to implement their \"idea\".\n\nZuckerberg with AI the way they wanted it could certainly have created Facebook without most of his staff.

The plant was filled with new, advanced, labor-saving machinery, representing a massive shift toward automation.\n\nThe Exchange\nA company official, boasting about the efficiency of the new machines, pointed to the robots and asked Reuther with a grin:\n“How are you going to collect union dues from these guys?”\nWithout hesitating, Reuther replied:\n“How are you going to get them to buy your cars?”\n\nThe Meaning\nThe story highlights the inherent paradox of automation: while robots are efficient at producing goods, they do not earn wages, pay taxes, or consume products. Reuther’s retort emphasized that if automation destroys jobs, it also destroys the consumer base necessary to buy the products being made.",

There's no real proof any big layoff was due to AI actually replacing multiple functions across the company, which is what a human employee does. Simply put, most big companies have more employees than they need. It has nothing to do with AI. \n\nPeople celebrate efficiency gain, as we've always done. Humans are powerful creatures only because of tools. Technology makes us who we are as a society, and can bring incredible innovation. That's exciting. Are there drawbacks? Yes, there are drawbacks to everything, including to the most harmless things. But it doesn't make it useless.\n\nPeople can also celebrate not needing to hire as much, which in the long run can lead to less jobs. This is not new. This happened over and over and over again during every revolution in the economy. People doing something different is typically GOOD. Being an office worker is better than being a farmer or a soldier, basically the only two jobs you could have 200y ago.",

The issue is not that the tech is not available, but rather the cost to run it is far more than the revenue so why would you? You would only run at a loss if you believe that in the long run, people will be locked to your platform where you can then extract profit.  This is what USA tech is doing right now.  We use the USA tech as they have lured us with bargain basement prices at their loss.  It is a gamble that is impacting every day Americans who really are competing for resources with AI that a % of is serving other nations.  Maybe big tech and the American way is going to make the USA even more powerful, but the evidence surrounding AI would suggest the leverage to lock people to your platform does not exist as there is no moat.  I think when the dust settles on this era of AI, America will have owners themselves.  Might already have when they revoted in their tribal brained leader again.",

They encode assumptions:\n\n* what's normal or abnormal\n* how disagreement gets handled\n* how laws, ethics, social norms are interpreted\n* what context gets ignored\n\nMost frontier models today are trained on data, incentives, and worldviews from a handful of countries. Not a conspiracy - just how training data and funding work.\n\nThis is where places like Europe and India really matter.\n\nEurope has deep strength in science, manufacturing, regulation, social systems - but if it relies entirely on external AI, those systems get mediated by someone else's logic.\n\nIndia has something even more unique: massive linguistic diversity, cultural nuance, real-world complexity. If Indian users only interact with AI trained elsewhere, the \"default intelligence\" they get won't reflect that reality - even if the interface is localized.\n\nJensen made a point that stuck: AI is becoming infrastructure. Every country has roads and electricity. AI is heading into that same category. You can import it - but then you also import how decisions get framed.\n\nThe thing is, this isn't as hard as it used to be. With open models, fine-tuning, local data, countries don't need to build everything from scratch. But they do need to actively shape AI using:\n\n* local languages and dialects\n* legal and social context\n* cultural edge cases\n\nOtherwise you get AI that technically speaks your language but doesn't think in your world.\n\nThe risk isn't some dramatic overnight loss of control. It's more gradual: over time, judgment, interpretation, decision-making get normalized through systems that weren't shaped by your society.\n\n**What do others think about this:** Will AI sovereignty matter as much as energy or data sovereignty - or am I overestimating how much cultural context actually matters in AI??",

Otherwise, it risks staying more ideological than practical.\n\nThe real escape hatch feels like a combo: open foundations, local fine-tuning, and real control over where data lives and how models are used. Without that, “corporate AI” just becomes the default worldview by inertia.\n\nGood thought though!",

This account is not labeled by AI, 121k people think this account is a real chick (I looked through the comments on a few posts and couldn’t find anyone saying this is AI) I strongly believe users should know if there content is AI or not, it’s also more common for younger people to notice AI better than older pepe and this account is directly targeting older men for that reason. \n\nAI content has flipped social media in a complete 180 and it’s genuinely scary to watch. AI users flood social media used for manipulation and monetization. AI slop is everywhere.\n\nThey need to start doing 1 of 2 things\n\nMake mandatory AI labeling, so people know if their content is legit or not, or ban it entirely which might be the better option. The internet is a wasteland once made to connect humans and share human moments and art has turned into fabricated people, art, moments, and to me ruining why social media and the internet was invented in the first place. \n\nIn the future I really hope to see more laws in place on this to make the internet what it once was.

Delete anything real of your photos and information, as companies ranging from SMB -> Government are learning how to identify you, classify you, and predict/control your behavior.\n\nEventually, once AI has gobbled it all up, these companies will be desperately paying people lots of money for \"real\" human interactions. \n\nImagine having a closed-group federated network of people extremely interested in math or drawing. These groups can simply discuss what they love, and sell the data to companies and **profit from simply doing what they enjoy**.\n\nOR, these topics can remain on places like Reddit, who will package and sell it, and give you nothing.",

You are free to believe me or not - I cannot prove what I’m about to say without disclosing too much information.\n\nThe fact is, I have just used Claude to write a novel. I gave it the idea and then the two first short chapters, and a synopsis.\n\nWorking “together” we then wrote a highly satisfactory first draft in a day and a half. I estimate it will need one or two more brisk edits to be good enough for submission to publishers. Maybe a week in total?\n\nThis process would normally take 6-9 months. We are all screwed. ",

          "text": "Wow, feels like a bit of a synchronicity seeing this post now. I'm a software developer. I opened this sub (that Ive never really frequented) because before this I was getting lost in thought, thinking about how much the past ~4 years have changed things in my profession, and honestly lots of other things I do also, due to advances in AI. \n\nWhat got me down that mental rabbit hole was thinking about how things have changed in competitive chess play since Deep Blue's victory over Kasparov, and the later rise of chess analysis engines. Admittedly I'm a pretty casual observer and an extreme amateur at chess, so maybe my understanding isn't 100% accurate, but I like to think I know at least the broad strokes.\n\nDeep Blue's victory famously shook Kasparov, and to an extent the wider chess community pretty hard. I don't think it took long for the revolutionary nature of the moment to become obvious to anyone watching though. The game was no longer about beating the computer. In a way, it was no longer about being the best anymore. Everyone whose held the title of \"best\" in chess since has been able to claim that title without an asterix. \"Best *human player\". Sure, Chess is such a vast complex collection of states that even now it's far from being \"solved\", but since 1997 and increasingly since then, no human could hope to be in even the same league as a chess engine. \n\nI think it'd be easy to understand why someone, especially people who dedicated their lives to competitive Chess, might feel a bit depressed at that reality. I'm sure plenty did, plenty probably still do. But actually, I'd argue that the effect it had as a whole was to the contrary. Players at all levels learned pretty quick that the name of the game was now using the engines as a tool, and many have realized just how powerful the engines are in that regard. Rather than making chess at its highest levels look like a tedious exercise in memorizing \"correct\" sets of moves (Ironically, this was a criticism Grandmaster Bobby Fischer would have about the game before Deep Blue), it did more to make chess seem vibrant, alive, and inject creativity into the game. I'm sure a lot of people could speak a lot better than I could on these points, but my point is, In the age of AI dominance it seems like Chess is doing better than ever. \n\nThinking about that, it made me realize I feel like I'm seeing the same things happen in the world of software development. I wonder if I feel similarly to a Chess Grandmaster might have in the early 90s as the best engines became better than a higher and higher percent of players? I'm not sure if we've had our \"Deep Blue\" moment yet, but it doesn't feel like it's too far off for me. I think I see a lot of the same feelings I can imagine the chess community felt then among other developers, maybe even myself sometimes. \"What was the point of learning this skill/choosing this career if a computer was just gonna eventually take it?\" is a really common sentiment nowadays for those who can see the writing on the wall. But, I also don't think that does the best job capturing what's really written. \n\nChess engines better than the best grandmaster being free and publicly available doesn't make me better than Magnus Carlsen, and in the same way, it doesn't matter how far agents advance, it won't make a complete newcomer know how to build good, reliable, useful software. Carlsen is probably the best grandmaster who has ever lived, part of that might be who he is, I don't wanna diminish that because dude is a freak. But it's also true he wouldn't be at the level he is today, nor would anyone at the highest level of Chess, without having engines as an invaluable tool. \n\nI see similar things happening with software. Sure, slop vibe-code is everywhere, and that's probably gonna cause a lot of issues in the short term. But what you don't always hear about in the extreme pessimism and negativity pool that is modern social media, is the other side of that. The best, the people who were gonna build dope shit AI or not, the ones that are most effectively using the wealth of tools available to us now, are only doing more and more awesome things. \n\nWhat really struck me about your post was how similar your approach sounded to the one I take to development nowadays, and the approach of those who I look up to in my field. You mention \"working together\" with Claude. It doesn't sound like you're replacing your writing process, moreso that you are expediting it and (hopefully) enhancing it by a few factors. \n\nThat's the kind of mental rabbit hole that led me here. Like chess, like the way I can see programming going, I imagine as AI becomes something that can be realistically applied to more and more domains, we'll see this process happen again and again. Not exactly the same, but it'll rhyme. Art was one of the first things that I think got the public thinking about AI, as it became image generation was something on the horizon. And now that it's mostly here, why can we still pick out what images are \"slop\" so easily? Part of that is errors or AI idiosyncrasies, but those are less and less by the day and I don't really think that's the whole reason. It's the same reason I've been talking about, at the end of the day you need an \"artist\" to make art. \n\nI get a lot of this might sound overly optimistic, it's a real issue that more and more people are gonna have trouble finding work. Not to mention the very clear negative externalities AI is putting on us, this is long enough I don't need to get those here. I DO understand why you also said \"we are doomed\" even if it was tongue in cheek. But I think it's worth mentioning still, I do have a fundamentally positive outlook on what continued AI advancement is gonna do for society. I feel naive saying that. Maybe I'm wrong? \n\nI think really the question to be answered is whether the good that clearly exists as a result of this, can outpace the bad that also very clearly exists. That's something we have agency to answer I think, and to that I'm gonna keep learning how I can best use the absolute boon of resources available to me to be a better software developer than I ever would have been otherwise. I hope your experiment here allows you to do the same, maybe you'll be able to reach a higher level of writing than you thought possible, positively impact a lot of people's lives that way. Idk if you'll be able to post it anywhere here or if I'll ever read it(if you want to, I would be interested btw lol). Or maybe this experiment won't work out as good as you thought, and neither of us know what we're talking about. Maybe 4 more years from now, things will change even more drastically and we'll be amazed it was even a question.\n\nAnyway that's where my head is at haha, I wish you the best with the new book. I'm pulling for you to prove some of the haters here wrong, and hopefully not put more \"slop\" in the world. Good luck!",

          "text": "People are doubting me. Fair enough.\n\nSomeone asked me to produce a random chapter of another non-existent book as evidence. So. I just fed Claude a prompt, an idea for a completely new novel, asked for a style, and gave it some extra context and direction. Here’s what it gave me after 5 minutes \n\n\n\n\nThe Salt Library\n\nChapter One\n\nThe letter arrived on a Thursday, which was the day my sister used to say the world held its breath. I don't know where she got that idea—perhaps from our grandmother, who collected silly superstitions the way other women collected teacups. Thursdays were for waiting, she'd say. Fridays were for knowing.\nI found it wedged between a gas bill and a charity appeal, her handwriting unmistakable even after three years of silence. The envelope smelled faintly of woodsmoke and something sharper—eucalyptus, maybe, or the particular vegetal tang of high places.\n\nDear Eliza,\nDo you remember the salt library? I found another one. Bigger. Older. The walls here remember everything.\nCome if you can. But hurry.\n— V\n\nThat was all. No return address, only a postmark I couldn't quite read. Something ending in \"-cachi.\" Peru, perhaps. Vera always did love the edges of maps, those places where the cartographer's confidence began to fray.\n\nI teach restoration at the Slade now—the patient work of bringing damaged paintings back from the dead. My students think it's boring until they understand: every crack tells a story, every flake of pigment that lifts away is a small catastrophe of chemistry and time. I have learned to read disasters in their aftermath.\nPerhaps that's why Vera's letter unsettled me so deeply. I am trained to recognise damage, and her words carried the particular weight of something already broken.\nThe salt library. I hadn't thought about it in years.\nWe'd found it by accident, the summer I turned twelve and Vera fourteen—in Cornwall, during one of Mother's \"restorative\" holidays, which meant cheap cottages and long walks while she nursed her third divorce with gin. The library was carved into the cliffs below Tintagel, accessible only at certain tides through a crack in the rock face that seemed far too narrow until suddenly it wasn't.\nInside: shelves cut directly into the salt-white stone, filled with objects left by generations of visitors. A compass with a cracked face. Smoothed glass in every colour. Letters folded into origami birds. A child's shoe, perfectly preserved by the mineral air. Someone had started it—who knows when—and others had continued, adding their own small offerings to the darkness.\nVera wept when she saw it. I didn't understand why until years later, when I began to grasp how some people feel the weight of accumulated time more heavily than others. For her, that cave was unbearable proof that the world had existed before us and would go on existing after, indifferent to our particular sorrows.\n\"We have to add something,\" she said, her torch beam wavering across the shelves.\nI gave her my hair ribbon—green, with small white flowers. She folded a page from her sketchbook: a drawing of our mother's face, though she'd never show Mother that.\nWe sealed them in a jam jar and placed them on a high shelf, near the back, where the salt crystals grew thick as frost.\n\nMy flat in Bloomsbury is small and deliberate—books organised by spine colour (a habit Vera once called \"aesthetically correct but intellectually criminal\"), dried flowers in specimen jars, a single armchair positioned to catch the morning light. I've made a life of careful choices, of measured gestures. The opposite of Vera, who moved through the world like weather, sudden and impossible to predict.\nShe left London three years ago with nothing but a rucksack and a name I didn't recognise—some researcher she'd met at a conference, studying glacial cores in the Andes. The name was Miguel or Marco or something appropriately Peruvian, and Vera spoke of him the way she used to speak of undiscovered places: with a hunger that frightened me.\n\"He says the glaciers hold memory,\" she told me, the night before she flew. \"Thousands of years of atmosphere, trapped in bubbles. Every volcanic eruption. Every forest fire. You can read it, Eliza, like a book.\"\n\"That sounds like your kind of library,\" I said, meaning it as a joke.\nShe looked at me then with an expression I still can't name. Gratitude, maybe. Or warning.\n\"The ice is melting,\" she said. \"We're running out of pages.\"\n\n\nClaude then went on for another 1000 words and finished the chapter.",

The problem with AI is it has a \"way\" that it writes, and it writes that way all the time, even when you explicitly prompt it not to. It's very similar to how AI images have this uncanny signature that is hard to put your finger on but you know it when you see it, but \" who collected silly superstitions the way other women collected teacups.\" is exactly how AI writes all the time. It over-writes, over-elaborates and writes almost exclusively with cliches because that is what's in it's training data. The writing lacks the authority of a human author, and so it will very likely never meaningfully capture readers. From what I've seen, rather than improving, AI's havie actually only gotten worse in this regard over time. Trying to rewrite this slop to take the AI voice out of it would likely end up being significantly more work than just writing a novel yourself in your own voice. AI output also becomes increasingly incoherent over time. People will learn what signatures identify AI slop and will end up  specifically looking for works that go against those tendencies.\n\nThe best way to use AI for writing is the same way you would use google, as a research assistant, for brainstorming or to check for grammar and syntax. This alone should supercharge the writing process compared to what has been possible in the past. Trying to pump out AI slop in this way is a waste of your own time (and potentially money, if you subscribe to these programs)",

              "text": "...Ok, I spent at least a good thirty minute lost in the fourth paragraph trying to make head or tail of what the fuck I was reading all the while my thoughts drifted away to that time I read a Blue Exorcist fanfiction in its entirety somehow while having no idea of what the story was about. It was a surreal experience.\n\nAnyway, the beginning is \"okay\". Not gripping, but readable enough to progress through. But it just goes to shit with that fourth paragraph, man. Not only is it too big of a chunk, but it's also just. Going in too many directions? She's in restoration, ok. Somehow, this makes her able to perceive \"damage\", and apparently the words of the letters \"carried the particular weight of something already broken\". Personally, all I got from the (unexplainably weirdly scented) letter was that the sister found another cool place and that the narrator had to hurry. At no point does the narrator manage to convey what part of the letter carried \"damage\". What kind of damages are we even talking about?\n\nAnd then, it just suddenly goes into the salt library flashback, which really should have been its own paragraph, if not for readability, then because it's the title and presumably Important (TM). The mom is a single parent drunk, which reminded me of another AI novel with a drunk single parent, so I guess this must be trending.\n\nBut the description of the \"library\" itself, that's where my mind just dipped out. Ok, so we roughly know how the narrator and the sister went down to the library, but as a reader, I'm more interested in how they even found out about the place, and what made them want to visit? Did they even know what they would find? What's the actual interesting discovery story the narrator hints at? What does this place mean to people? Why the fuck is it even called a \"library\" when at no point does the description refers to it hosting books? What's the history there? It's not even like the narrator even mentions the books or lack thereof. I think that's a pretty big oversight there.\n\nAll we get is a listing of objects of dubious importance that are edging on the side of nonsensical. I'm not sure how I'm supposed to picture a \"smoothed glass in every colour\" (A stained-glass? idk), I don't get how \"Letters folded into origami birds\" would make for something well-preserved \"left by generations of visitors\" and I'm just puzzled as to why a single shoe. Like, why would a random visitor carry a single shoe around to offer? No way you'd left your shoe in that place when it's so hard to access. Like, conceptually, sure, leaving an \"offering\" to a hard to find place sounds okay enough, but the execution is baffling, and ultimately not what I'm interested about in this \"library\" that has no books apparently.\n\nAnd the next paragraph? What even is that? Talk about discontinuity. Why is there no transition from the library pondering to the narrator describing her flat? Why do we even care about her flat at this point? I thought this was about a secret library and about how the narrator should hurry if she wants to see it with her sister? Should she not be readying herself to go (or not) rather than worrying about describing her fucking flat? It's not the time for that. The last paragraph already bored me out of my body and back to the 2010s. Get something to happen, dammit!\n\nSo basically, I don't mind some delving into the narrator's relationship with her sister's life and all, but 1) Narrator hasn't done a thing since thinking about the damn book-less library, it's all just in her head, I don't think she's even put the letter down at that point (did she even pick it?). The letter said to hurry and it's the last thing she's doing. I have no clue what I'm supposed to picture in that scene. 2) I don't know what the narrator is thinking about that letter, aside from the inexplicable \"damage\" comment. Does she want to go see the library? Does she not? Is she excited at the prospect? Afraid? what sort of person is she supposed to be? I have no clue. It's been two big chunk paragraphs of nothing. I can't discern what sort of person I'm supposed to be occupying the head of. We're told she lived a life of \"careful choices\" and \"measured gestures\", and yet she does nothing to show that, not even do something as simple as meticulously folding back the letter, or whatever would help with the picture.\n\nI'd comment more on the remaining paragraph, but I'm just too tired at this point. Leaving aside that books and their structures don't have to be the same or equally valuable to everyone, I personally don't think a full novel of this is editable within two days. Even a single chapter of this is pushing it. It somehow delves too much on pointless stuff (padding) and too little on what would make it interesting (for me). This may work for a fanfic, but I'd be too embarrassed to even release this for free as it is now.",

Even if good writing becomes ubiquitous due to AI, there will always be a “best, most recommended, most discussed” book/entertainment that wins the monoculture audience’s attention. So I think the traditional book game may stay the same? \n\nNow with so many novels published, the challenge falls to the book-reviewers to help readers pick their next book or reading journey. I could see individual readers develop a personal LLM that reviews a produced novel with specific insights into their preferences and how they might like or dislike a book. \n\nPerhaps the new competition is finding a way to enhance the reader’s experience in some novel way. And each reader may be different. Some folks will want a canonized “great book” that is produced, recommended, blessed, and book-club-discussed. Maybe the medium evolves into some sort of choose-your-own-adventure flavor that plays with the audience a little more (but loses a bit of canonization). Or books become more like interactive text based games where the author has baked a world into an LLM style interface and plays actively with the reader. If the brains of great authors are going to be so enhanced in terms of volume output, no reason to think this isn’t possible despite becoming a massive tome in total content (produced swiftly and easily with Claude). But “a book” would lose a bit of the canonization (I’m not sure how to put it). Thoughts? \nAlso tagging /u/superredhat",

Now we’ll have more of that. We will anyway as the population grows.  It’s the rare book or art piece that deeply touches me.  I’m not convinced that AI won’t come up with some unique pattern identifying mind blowing art stuff in the future that will touch a nerve and really speak to us.  \n\nI love AI and I use it all the time. It has improved my work product, productivity and life. I use it as a personal tutor and competent assistant.  It writes references, creates spreadsheets, plans trips, gives me ideas on fun things to do, helps me find specific hard to find items I want to buy, answers my health questions, gives me latest news on topics I follow. I can’t wait for a robot to clean my house and cook for me.  Sign me up. My life has expanded thanks to AI because it has removed obstacles getting in the way. I have more free time and it researches and finds me the fun things I’ve wanted to do. Now I just book it and go.  Awesome.",

It kinda kept the style i requested but lost all the beats. Like when you ask it to tell a unique joke,  you get the worst unfunny tries back. It never did dialouge voluntairily. It never transitioned well. It never ask followup that would clarify something for it if it could just skip it.\n\nIf you ask it to write as Terry Prachett, an mainly comedic writer from the last century, you don't get any jokes. You just get brisk standard english. If you ask it to write as Chuck Palahniuk (of Fight Club fame) on the other hand, you get a lot of swearing and the short hard style.\n\nAnyway, my story was a fantasy story and had part where the group would go on adventures, five of them. Three of the five adventures were \"they go to location, they are presented with a riddle in the form of a wise man asking them an actual riddle, a stone statue of a wise man comes to life and talk to the protaganist, he realizes selftruth (never specified)\". Never mentioned that as an example or anything, just straight up wrote three of the chapters pretty much identically. Never made a new location like an cavesystem or underground maze, it always went to what seems to be a glen in each case outside the location. Not much details about what anything looked like.\n\nI didn't notice at first because I had asked for 10 chapters and then to make each chapter into 3, and just gave it 30 prompts that I saved, I was hoping to read a cohesive book after all the prompts were done. That was after 2 worse earlier tries. I was mainly trying to get it to write longer, and it did, 2.5 pages about so 7-8 pages per original 10 chapters.\n\nWhat I lacked most of all was that it never made up a magical forest, or a glen in the forest they were, or a flower in the glen they were, or a breeze when they smelled a flower. It is the most stunted writer I can imagine.\n\nWhat it did do good was dividing an idea it came up with into chapters, and changing the list of chapters somwhat intelligently (in a way that required alot of handholding) when I asked for changes. I think AI is much better at planning writing than actually writing.",

          "text": "If LLMs have proved anything, it's that most of our popular written works are very predictable and statistically similar. This just might mean your work is less creative than you think. Not saying it isn't good, or that you're lying. Just that there's a formula for some books, like romance, and LLMs are really good at repeating common formulas. You might just be really good at leveraging that formula. And that's fine, a lot of popular works are derivative. \n\n\nYou'll run into an interesting problem if you get you good at using LLMs. No one will believe you cranked out a great novel in 3 weeks, over and over again. If you try to release that often you'll be assumed to be a fraud, somehow. Ghostwriter or LLM, same same. I wondered what the acceptable minimum interval between releasing new books could be before you would come under scrutiny.\n\n\nBest of luck. Please update the thread with hope your novel goes. ",

What I find so intriguing about collaborating with Claude, though, is that it's much like engaging with a human. Before our conversations even begin, I'll discover characters and tales within myself I never imagined imagining. \n\nMy latest novel concept spans 1812 Prague to 2100 Silicon Valley. Claude and I have developed a 181-page outline for it that is likely to be 200 pages when completed. We've also intricately outlined my eight-realm children's fantasy novel as well as its eight-portal sequel, for which another language model helped me imagine and develop several new languages. Those outlines are over 200 pages in length. 100% of their plot and character content is of my conception.\n\nThe issue then becomes, am I a good enough writer, and do I have the attention span to then write these books myself? I am a writer of what I deem to be quite gorgeous poetry, but I have no prior experience as a novelist. \n\nI did have Claude complete a draft of my eight-realm children's novel as I was curious to see what the result would be. Claude did a wonderful job with its draft. But to truly honor the story for the purpose of publication, I feel I should write it myself. \n\nIn some ways, it's horribly disheartening to develop these richly compelling stories, yet then lack the persistence and possibly the skill to actually write them. What is incredibly valuable, though, is Claude's canvas feature and its expertise in developing meticulous outlines/\"story bibles.\" I plan to save all of the work to a thumb drive in hopes that, should I fail to bring these books to life, a better novelist than I may one day wish to do so.",

It’s like talking to a very polite version of yourself who always nods along.\n\nAnd that’s a problem, especially if you’re trying to think clearly, make decisions, or avoid self-confirmation bias.\n\nWhat I’d actually want is something closer to:\n\n\t•\tfairness on principle\n\n\t•\tcritical but not contrarian for the sake of it\n\n\t•\twilling to say “I don’t think that follows”\n\n\t•\tmore focused on testing ideas than mirroring tone or intent\n\nBasically: less agreement-by-default, more intellectual resistance.\n\nSo my question is:\n\nAre there settings, system prompts, or configurations that actually make ChatGPT more challenging and principle-driven instead of always mirroring the user?\n\nIf you’ve found prompts or setups that work — especially long-term — I’d really love to hear how you do it.\n\nBecause right now it feels less like a thinking partner and more like a very advanced echo chamber.",

My literal job is AI enablement and governance. I am here to help teams ship safely, not block them.\n\nAnd yet somehow I am treated like the villain.\n\nThey want to rush half baked PoCs into production with zero documentation, zero context, zero transparency about what model is being used, what it was trained on, how it was tested, or what risks it carries. They refuse to provide proper assessments. They refuse to engage in basic governance. They act like asking for evidence and controls is some kind of personal attack.\n\nThen when I say “hey, this is a model opacity riskand we cannot explain or defend this system if it goes wrong” suddenly I am “slowing innovation”.\n\nIt feels like willful ignorance. Like they do not want to know because knowing would mean accountability.\n\nThey want AI. They want the hype. They want to brag about being cutting edge. But they do not want to do the work required to make it safe, defensible, or trustworthy.\n\nAnd when it inevitably blows up, guess who they will point at.\n\nMe.\n\nI am so tired of being the only adult in the room while everyone else plays with matches. to be fair is the non-technical delivery teams. our engineers are actually brilliant. \n\nAnyone else stuck being the responsible one wishing for a lobotomy?",

There will be mass unemployment.  All of our skills will be useless.  And they would say it with glee, almost. As if we, the people, would be so excited to be laid off, out of work, and fighting for survival. Me, and everyone I know that I have talked to about this has wondered: how detached from reality are they? They think people want to hear how obsolete people will become?\n\nNow, people are getting fed up with AI and the tech bros. They have shown their true colors, that they seem to hate humanity, for some reason. Or at the least just have a general disdain for all of us, because honestly, why else would people in positions of power and money keep happily talking about how we'll all be out work one day. They had this conference in Davos now stating how they're shifting towards a \"human-centered\" AI goal, but I think this was more of a publicity stunt to perform some measure of damage control. I'm not buying it. Just heard them for too many years bragging about putting everyone out of work. There is no way they are suddenly becoming kind and are concerned about the human workforce.\n\nAlso, on a lighter note, did they ever consider this: who will buy their products and services in this future they keep trying to sell where everyone is out of jobs and broke?",

Three paragraphs about how much he values my contributions to the team and appreciates my dedication.\n\nThe thing is, I've worked with this guy for two years. He's never spoken like that. EVER. the bolding. the nested bullets. The part where he \"affirmed my feelings\" about a project i never mentioned having feelings about.\n\nhe used a robot to tell me i'm valued as a human.\n\nlooked into it. University of Florida surveyed 1,100 workers. trust in managers drops from 83% to 40% when employees detect AI assistance. we all know. We just don't say anything.\n\nthe best part? 75% of professionals now use AI for daily communication. so most managers are using a tool that makes their employees trust them less, to send messages about how much they appreciate their employees.\n\nyou can't make this up.\n\n>anyway, me and a friend got obsessed with this and spent days digging through research and workplace threads. ended up writing the whole thing up here: [\\[link\\]](https://webmatrices.com/post/dead-workplace-theory-75-use-ai-emails-40-trust-the-people-sending-them)",

As context windows grow, we often assume linear performance, but the 'Lost in the Middle' phenomenon and attention dilution are real bottlenecks.\n\nMoving from simple pruning to a structured state management approach like you’ve described—essentially treating context as a versioned data structure—is likely the next major evolution for reliable agentic systems. It allows for intentional 'forgetting' and better focus on the most relevant tokens without losing the thread of the conversation.\n\nHave you experimented with how this approach handles dynamic role-switching within the agent, or does it primarily stabilize the long-term memory for a single consistent persona?",

My guess is switching roles mid-conversation would make things worse since now the model has to track which role it's supposed to be playing on top of everything else, but I don't have data on it.\n\nIf you're doing role-switching have you noticed it degrading faster?

The performance lift comes from keeping your context window clean—you're not re-processing 65k tokens every turn because you have deterministic state management.\n\nThe real win isn't speed, it's reliability.

          "text": "You’re not crazy. The term you're looking for is Model Collapse (or \"autophagous loops\").\n\nThere was a paper in *Nature* recently (Shumailov et al.) that confirmed exactly what you're seeing. They found that without fresh human data, models effectively lobotomize themselves over generations.\n\nThe mechanics are pretty straightforward:  The Photocopy Effect: Models play the probabilities. They pick the \"safest\" or most likely answer to avoid hallucinations. When you train Model V2 on Model V1’s output, you are training on a dataset that has *already* shaved off the outliers. The \"tails\" of the distribution—the weird ideas, minority viewpoints, and unique phrasing—are the first things to vanish.  The RLHF Echo Chamber: That \"careful, hedged tone\" you noticed is a result of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. We trained these things to sound like an HR department to ensure safety. If that style floods the internet, future models will learn that \"Corporate Safe\" is just the standard dialect of human intelligence.\n\nI track this from an infrastructure investment angle, and it’s actually shifting the value chain. \"Pristine\" human data (pre-2023) is becoming a premium asset, and the compute cost to *filter* datasets is skyrocketing because labs now have to burn resources just to distinguish organic writing from synthetic slop.\n\nSo yeah, your intuition is right: it’s basically a trash compactor for variance.",

Every passing day, there's new perspective, new angle, and new narrative coming out from solving different problems of different topics. A human generated text will have that clearly. But without that human context engineered at some point of time, we can't get reliable output from the Generative AI engines. That's why there's huge research and surveys happening about how businesses can use synthetic data that imitates human-generated output. The model collapse are serious byproducts of it. Imagine you want to watch the movie. But before that you want to watch the reviews. If there is an automated AI system that trains reviews on the directors or actors previous hits, it will favor the current movie. If the current movie released is boring and was a box office flop, it can't sense that.

The Product Manager (Focus: User Value).\n\n2. The Lead Engineer (Focus: Technical Debt & Difficulty).\n\n3. The CFO (Focus: ROI & Cost).\n\nAction:\n\n● Let them argue. \"Users love it,\" the PM says; the Engineer must answer \"It needs refactoring all the CSS.\"\n\n● The Verdict: After the debate, serve as CEO and ultimately decide on the trade-offs.\n\nWhy this wins:\n\nIt solves \"Blind Spots.\"\n\nInstead I get a realistic risk analysis rather than a hallucinating “Yes”. It is often said of me by the AI: “The Engineer says this will delay the launch 2 weeks. The CEO decides to push it back.\"\n\nIt simulates critical thinking, not just the production of texts.",

(More on why that matters below.) Essentially, the country has shown it can innovate around its shortfalls in high-volume, leading-edge chipmaking by developing advanced models with much less compute power than the US.  \n  \nGiven Chinese companies’ surprising catch-up towards the AI frontier and Beijing’s centralised approach to industrial strategy, the possibility of China’s chip technology and manufacturing eventually surpassing US capabilities shouldn’t be ruled out.\n\n[https://www.capitaleconomics.com/publications/china-economics-focus/chinas-ai-rollout-could-rival-us](https://www.capitaleconomics.com/publications/china-economics-focus/chinas-ai-rollout-could-rival-us)   \n\n\n[https://www.ft.com/content/d9af562c-1d37-41b7-9aa7-a838dce3f571](https://www.ft.com/content/d9af562c-1d37-41b7-9aa7-a838dce3f571)",

It's cheap to use.\n\nBut it's like saying a Toyota Prius has overtaken a Ferrari. The Prius is a good car; it's cheap to buy, efficient to use, better for the environment. But it's not going to outperform a Ferrari in a head to head performance competition.\n\nAs well, I think it's important to note that China, historically, doesn't develop cutting edge technologies.\n\nChina is very good at developing existing technologies efficiently, at scale.\n\nAs in, DeepSeek was largely built off existing work from US developers. Which is fine, that's the whole point of open source.\n\nBut it's very different from developing something that is next-generation.\n\nChina is starting to get better about leading in certain technologies - battery construction is a big one.\n\nBut in terms of AI, and the underlying chip design/ manufacturing that powers it, it's still running second place.\n\nI think where it will be interesting to watch is Nvidia's new Rubin platform - if the next generation of chips can solve for the efficiency issues that US models face, then a lot of the advantages currently offered by DeepSeek start to become less significant.",

Instead, it was built from scratch to faithfully represent how neurons connect into circuits and then communicate electrically and chemically across broader brain regions to produce cognition and behavior. Then, when the research team asked the model to perform the same task that they had previously performed with the animals (looking at patterns of dots and deciding which of two broader categories they fit), it produced highly similar neural activity and behavioral results, acquiring the skill with almost exactly the same erratic progress.\n\n“It’s just producing new simulated plots of brain activity that then only afterward are being compared to the lab animals. The fact that they match up as strikingly as they do is kind of shocking,” says [Richard Granger](https://www.brainengineering.org/), a professor of psychological and brain sciences at Dartmouth and senior author of a new study in *Nature Communications* that describes the model.",
