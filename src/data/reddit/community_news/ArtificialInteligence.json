              "text": "I do not want to be rude - but personally, it seems that people using frontier LLM’s are able to confuse *their own* limitations with the systems limitations.\n\nI played around for years with it (as a SWE biding my time) and when it became difficult to poke the traditional holes, paid for a pro plan and as a test just saw how much of my job I could automate. Well, it did it all, and more. I now only interact with it when a new model is released and see how much more capable it is, then close it.\n\nMy experience:\n\n- 2022, fun stories. My first prompt was about my dog and Tiger Woods hanging out. GPT crafts a silly story about them winning the ‘golden putter’ or something. I was horrified. Stress tested via knowledge I know to be true. It was kinda like talking to someone who just woke up from a 5 year coma. Kinda makes sense, suggestions kinda out of date. \n\n- 2023, idk whether it was model progress or user progress but, “search engine with context.” Example: “I need to build a service that does ____. Where do I start?” and research documentation from there.\n\n- 2024, impressive capability with code blocks. I’m able to get a template function that does X and remove their variables and substitute my own. Maybe 50% of the time it’s worth it.\n\n- 2025, its templating things like json for me when I say “I need .json for this static thing. Set up the template for me with these fields, and any relevant fields I may need.” At *some* point, I realized it truly was only fucking up when I changed something and forgot to make it aware of the changes. Vomit, despair - “Prompt Engineering” started saving me time.\n\n- January 2026, it’s unbelievable. Unrecognizable. People who say “I’m an SWE, it’s nothing don’t worry” start to look like malicious liars with *really full pockets* to me, more than the terrified guys at the top saying “this could replace you.” When I stress test it via personal insight, I see no errors or flaws to a deep degree. I isolate a CLI agent in docker on a separate machine than anything I’m using. In 5 hours, I set up a system where I receive a survey from GPT, I answer it, and it generates an app based on my responses it thinks I need. Zero bugs. Works out of the box. Apps weren’t great at first, but over time they have gotten more and more refined. I do not use the apps, I am just watching how this little system I have set up evolves. I say “make it prettier” and it does, with no extra guidance. I am humbled, terrified.\n\nNow, I look at the layoffs and wonder, is this it? Are we seeing it? No one is coming to save them. Certainly not the free market, and this is a big shakeup. I look at other countries and AI. I look at the fact that open source models exist - it cannot be stamped out. When one country is able to automate and keep people happy - oh boy. I do not know what will happen. If there were adults in the room, it’d be fine. No, it’s not a new technology. But its capabilities as it relates to the public are new. If the tech has plateaued or plateaus soon, it could already revolutionize everything.\n\nSo when you say “it’s hype man,” I’m curious. Are you naive and lying, or am I? Are you able to genuinely consider the same question? If nothing I wrote sounds implausible to you and you still say “it’s hype,” then I am relieved because clearly there are MUCH more capable and intelligent people on top of this than me, the lowly worker who needs to skill up.",

No I don't mean one that needed constant handholding and prompting and revision by an engineer. I mean a legitimate working application that it built from zero. I would genuinely love to see and use it.\n\nAdditionally, a step further, what kind of applications are we talking about here? Are we talking about the most commonly produced CRUD apps out there that every new grad can copy via instructions? Because it just doesn't seem impressive that a copy machine can make copies. Can it actually build something useful on its own? Can it make decisions that actually make sense so that impact is actually delivered in the real world? Can it contextualize the real world at all? \n\nAs far as I can see, AI is extremely good at looking the part. But when it matters, the facade falls away. \n\nAlso, if I wrong, which I very well could be, where is the evidence? I don't mean jobs data (lots of factors involved) I'm talking about the explosion in USEFUL software (not just an increase in git commits). If what you say is true, we should be seeing incredible leaps. Deepseek should be making cheaper to train, more widely available deepseeks, AI should be propelling itself so rapidly that SaaS should be dead. Every industry in the world should be easily showing and proving how AI is making a massive positive impact.\n\nInstead what I see is silicon valley CEOs doing everything in their power to convince people they need these tools and a slice of the engineering population being convinced simply because it can spit out functional code. \n\nA final question, why would a product so useful it can replace the human workforce, not even be able to sell itself to the public on its use case?

It may eventually get easy enough that any reasonably smart person can build software, as opposed to a reasonably smart person with special knowledge, which is how it’s been for the last 50 years. None of this is scary though, in my view. It’s exciting! Much will be accomplished. Many problems will be solved. Vastly more complicated problems will be undertaken and solved — things like drug discovery, astrophysics, ecology, biology, will all be solved by software that we can’t currently build because of the complexity.",

Relational database systems have been around for over 50 years, yet how many companies have stored tabular information in collections of Excel files saved on network shares up until recently, if not today?\n\nWhen the modern smartphone came about (which is now so powerful that it can literally encode 4K video and run local AI models), it changed things considerably, but maybe not as extremely as first predicted. \"There's an app for that\" was the slogan, suggesting that for every last niche need, there would be a tailor-made app. While that is true to some extent, I'd argue that a lot of people mainly use their phones for staples. Mail, news, calendar, authenticator apps, messaging, photos, the works. Conversely, looking at niche apps, it's sometimes still quite challenging to find one that isn't shoddy or cavalier with privacy.\n\nThe staples weren't first made possible with iPhone-style smartphones, they were already feasible on the older-fashioned smartphones (well, app-based TFA wasn't around at that time AFAIK) and before that, a lot were covered by PDAs (even navigation) which were designed to be sat in a cradle and sync all new data to your device so you'd then have it available on the go, even without an internet connection.\n\nTechnological capability alone is never the only and sometimes far from the most important driver. All the way back in the 1860s, the first facsimile machine was commercialized that allowed to transmit not just beeps but actual b/w images over telegraph lines. The American civil war was still ongoing at the time, so quite a mind-boggling achievement. But interest was limited due to a number of factors and it wouldn't be until the 1920s that wiring photos became commonplace.",

They needed billions in funding and the only way to do that was to convince investors that this technology would change the world. In reality, there are many bottlenecks preventing AI from ever achieving the real-world applications they promised. 95% of companies that deployed AI found no appreciable increase in productivity, and in most cases AI performs worse than their human counterpart. OpenAI and all these other companies know that AI is largely useless, which is why instead of letting users choose AI, they’re forcing it into spaces no one asked for, in many cases detrimental to the user experience. The chickens have come home to roost, and they need to justify the billions of investor dollars they spent. But AI has around a 3% paying customer base, meaning 97% of people willing to use AI aren’t willing to pay for it. My guess is because AI doesn’t really do anything that wasn’t already possible, at least for the average consumer.",

I do see some good use cases for LLMs, e.g. translation, web searches, code debugging. Anything else is absolutely questionable and unreliable. The AI bubble is not only about to burst because of the insane amount of money that can't be returned to the investors without changing 2 or 3 fundamental physical constants, but also because of a looming global understanding that most AI tools will always be unreliable and can't take over responsibility to actually replace human workforce one day. Ask OpenAI if they will ever take over responsibility for what their tools do or if their business model will ever include guarantees and warranties. They will never do it, and so every CEO who replaces humans with AI is basically acting negligent",

Very time consuming projects that couldn't be rationalized from a resource perspective become possible but also we won't need as many humans doing basic shit.\n\nHuge, huge problem is that the average Joe has no idea how fast this is actually happening.  In my industry I'm seeing it happen, it being the elimination of jobs, inside the next 12-18 months.  This isn't speculation, it's reality.\n\nIf and when we get to the point where llms can achieve human level accuracy for the field which is about 98% (right now llms are only at 60-70%) then we have a huge problem for humans.

Most of it is cherry-picked, runs on clean data, and falls apart the second you introduce a real business process with messy inputs and edge cases.\n\nThe deployment economy is what's actually happening in companies right now. And it looks exactly like that finance guy's comment below — uploading a PDF to CoPilot and saving an associate 3 hours of data entry. It's not sexy. It doesn't get 50K likes on Twitter. But it's real and it compounds.\n\nI work in corporate law and the pattern is identical. The hype says \"AI will replace lawyers.\" The reality is I built tools that turn a 6-hour contract review into a 45-minute contract review. Nobody got replaced. Everyone just stopped doing the mind-numbing parts of their job.\n\nThe confusion comes from people conflating what AI can do in a controlled demo with what AI can do inside an actual organization that has legacy systems, inconsistent data, compliance requirements, and employees who can't open a PDF. The technology isn't the bottleneck — organisational readiness is.\n\nWhere is it leading? Exactly where every previous technology wave led. Not to the revolution that was promised in year one, but to a slow, boring, compounding productivity gain that becomes obvious in year five.\n",

          "text": "What happens when all the business fire employees, and they rely on ai, and then the internet companies jack up rates to the point that it sucks up all your profit. With out it, you are sunk. The man who owns the internet, owns the world. \n\nAI Slop…..\n\nHere’s how the logic plays out:\nThe trap builds in stages. Businesses cut labor costs by adopting AI, which feels like pure efficiency gain. But that AI runs on cloud infrastructure, API access, and bandwidth — all controlled by a small number of companies. Once you’ve restructured your entire operation around those services, switching costs become enormous. You’re locked in.\nThen pricing power kicks in. This is classic platform economics. Amazon, Google, Microsoft — they can price competitively while you’re building dependency, then extract rent once you can’t leave. It’s the same story as printer ink, or how app stores take 30% cuts. The infrastructure owner becomes a silent partner in every business that uses it.\nThe concentration problem is real. A handful of companies control the major cloud platforms, the undersea cables, the backbone routing, and increasingly the AI models themselves. That’s not just economic power — it bleeds into political power, as you’re implying.\nHistorical parallels are instructive. Railroads did this in the 19th century — whoever controlled the rails controlled commerce, and they used it ruthlessly until antitrust law broke them up. Standard Oil did it with pipelines. The internet was supposed to be different because it was designed to be decentralized, but the services running on it have re-centralized dramatically.\nThe counterforces that could push back:\nOpen-source AI models reduce dependency on proprietary systems. Municipal broadband and public utility frameworks for internet access could change the ownership structure. Antitrust enforcement, if serious, could break up concentrations of infrastructure power. And some businesses will find that the AI efficiency gains are real enough to absorb higher infrastructure costs — but your point stands that the margin gets squeezed toward whoever owns the pipe.\nThe deepest version of your concern is this: physical capital (factories, land) was at least visible and distributed in ways that allowed competition. Digital infrastructure tends toward monopoly naturally because of network effects and the massive capital required to build it. That makes the political question — who regulates or owns critical infrastructure — arguably the defining economic question of the next few decades.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

AI being a bubble about to pop nothing burger.\n\nI think we are at the point now where we can say... people really don't dig Generative AI that much. Sure it's going to replace a lot of manpower in low brow stuff like commercials, but it's clearly not replacing humanity in the arts. AI shorts were cool to watch when they first started popping up... now they are an insta pass for me. But AI used in ads, I don't care, a lot of people do though. \n\nSupposedly my job is to be replaced by AI in the next 1,2, or at most 3 years according to the pundits. I work at a computer all day. Pulling up engineering drawings, finding parts, entering orders, etc.... AI will supposedly be able to observe me and after a while replace me. Don't see it happening. There are too many little things that will throw it off. Kinda like those delivery vehicle in China not knowing how to deal with varying terrains yet.\n\nSometime I have a 200 page manual and need to find a specific part. AI is great for this. I upload the manual and ask it to find the part. Done. It's a great tool. But at the end of the day.... this is just a language prediction model. A great tool, but I think the snake oil salesmen are trying to con us to keep that money coming in... I don't see AI taking over the world. But we'll have to wait a couple of years to see who's right.\n\nOn a scale of NFTs to Cellphones... AI feels somewhere in between.

In the early internet days I remember lots of excitement around how better chips were allowing the ability to process more and then design better chips. The same talking points those that claim we are accelerating towards the singularity use are copy pasted from the early internet era and barely changed at all. With 3D printing there was a lot of buzz about how it would kill production and revolutionize it and we would wind up in a post scarcity society. None of the buzz around AI is even remotely original. So expecting more than the same, just with some new facet added in the long run, seems like people just getting swept away in a scene.\n\nI do personally think there are a few things we will see soon though. After DSLRs heavily proliferated there was a boom in people offering to shoot weddings and other important events, only for a couple years to pass and suddenly an entire industry appeared where actual professional photographers would shoot recreations of events because the amateurs handled them so poorly. I suspect we are seeing a boom right now that is similar. Many new ideas and things are being created right now. In the long run, a few will stick. Most will likely fade with time naturally as the exploratory phase of AI passes. \n\nYou’re very right about clients who can’t read PDFs too. It’s incredibly short sighted to not acknowledge a massive amount of humanity’s capabilities lies in the knowledge contained in people that don’t know how to and possibly don’t want to interact with AI. In the long run I suspect one of the most valuable positions for those of us who do embrace AI to be in will be knowing what we can do with AI so that we can be the interface between other members of humanity and those AI capabilities. Most people don’t want to, and probably won’t learn AI. It’s fine.\n\nIt also feels like there’s far more pressure now to develop less traditionally STEM related abilities. If all you know is a specific language, theory, anything really, but are terrible at working with other people, you are literally the most replaceable type of developer now. Because things are shifting towards an economy of ideas being relevant, as well as our ability to interact facilitating if those ideas can be expressed and made. And it’s wild because there is no level of expertise at any language or such that can change the fact that from now on, if you can’t work with people well, you have made yourself obsolete.",

As everything else, adult is the first realm anything happens.\n\nBefore adult tubes and free cams started become prevalent, if a woman wanted to stream live and show nudity, she'd almost certainly make money hand over fist. There weren't that many doing it, most people were still paying for porn let alone for live interaction with someone willing to be naked for them. Anyone would know they'd have to get a private show to see actual nudity, and I imagine back then they'd probably be like $10 per minute.\n\nThen between tubes and free cam sites, what happened? Well now, you've got thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of women on these cam sites, OnlyFans, etc. bearing everything and most of them are not making a whole lot doing that. Would be totally unheard of a couple decades ago. Now, it's just how it is. Oh you won't get jackhammered on your free cam feed? The user will just go to the next one. Wait til more unfiltered AI becomes normal and it'll be even worse. Yes, you may see stories of some people making gobs on OnlyFans, but the percentage of them doing that is much smaller than we'd all like to believe, and the thought of bearing all for relative pennies is just awful to think about.\n\nAnyways, now swap the industry with any other skilled industry now, because AI gives anyone the skill. They're all effectively flooded now.\n\nCopywriters probably thought 4 years ago there was absolutely no fucking way their jobs weren't safe. Designers making stuff like social media images, banner images, logos, etc. probably thought no fucking way their jobs weren't safe. Video animators probably thought no fucking way their jobs weren't safe. Consultants/coaches probably thought no fucking way their jobs weren't safe.\n\nNow, they're maybe not at the free cam situation I mentioned above just yet, but if not, they're well on their way to it. It'll be \"show me you can beat my AI output that took a minute or I'll go to the next one\". Their output is worth a tiny fraction of what it was before because it's everywhere now. Hardly anyone is in the 1% or soon probably 0.1% of the professionals in their industry who remain \"unique snowflakes\" who can still make out well.\n\nThe question is whether UBI will come fast enough before an awful lot of people are in an awful bad situation. I don't think it will. Absolutely no politicians are bringing it up. Anyone who would will be immediately labeled as some radical weirdo who thinks money grows on trees. But that'll be the reality. People will need their basic needs for survival met, or the first world will turn into the third world really quickly and people will wonder wtf happened and how tf it happened and why no one was doing anything about it.",

It saves me hundreds of hours a month.\n\nAnd last week I had a client who needed help attaching a file to an email.\n\nBoth of these things are true at the same time and that's not a contradiction. That's just what technology adoption has always looked like. The internet existed for years before your parents stopped printing MapQuest directions.\n\nThe \"everything is possible but nothing is changing\" feeling comes from expecting adoption to be uniform. It never is. The people who are quiet and actually building workflows around AI right now are pulling away from everyone else at a speed that won't be visible for another 12 to 18 months. And when it becomes visible, the \"what the fuck happened\" posts will be even louder.\n\nYou're asking the right questions.

Consumers, people, the public, humans, employees, whatever you wanna call them, we're irrelevant, oxygen and space stealing bugs.\n\nI vibe code mini apps with GUIs that integrate into a bunch of e-comm APIs for synchronization and ease of product management, Python scripts, web app utility userscripts, Adobe scripts, stuff to speed up and automate work.\n\nRecently, silver prices went up, so we swapped certain silver elements in our products with something else. I had to change 500 messy, inconsistent HTML product descriptions. I vibe coded an app that is a better product management frontend than our e-comm platform with its own API. And then I added a feature that would dump all of those descriptions, in a JSON, in a single piece of plaintext. Then with another Python script I preprocessed it and split into parts. Then I fed that to Gemini with structured output so it could provide me with the corrected ones. It was spot on. Later I tested some other parts (only about 30 products), but based on image recognition instead of manually picking which one has specific silver parts. Again, that just... worked. Matched images to IDs and IDs to descriptions again.\n\nWhen I say \"vibe coding\" I'm saying that I have about 10-ish years of on-and-off full-stack webdev experience. I am not really good at it, but I can tell what's going on in the code, how to handle keys and tokens, etc.\n\nIf I was smart and had the energy for it I'd already be giving my own business a shot. But I'm a lazy dumbass. Most people are lazy dumbasses.\n\nInstead, I slave away. And 10, even 5 years ago it would be UNFATHOMABLE to do the amount of work I do as a single person.

Instead I just want to go home after 8 hours, not 12. **AI lengthens my work day because expectations increase faster than my ability to accelerate my work.**\n\nSo, protip - always be a slacker. Always work at your 50%. Never give it your all if it's not your own business, AI or not. They'll milk you for your time and effort, you'll give them a finger and they'll take your whole arm.

The massive disconnect you're feeling is because the entire industry is obsessed with building 'brains' (LLMs/Agents), but almost nobody is building the 'nervous system' (the infrastructure).\nRight now, AI is just a brain in a jar hosted in a centralized cloud. It's great at isolated tasks like that PDF-to-Excel conversion. But true 'agentic' workflows fail in the real world because AI doesn't have a standardized, secure way to interact with local, proprietary enterprise systems.\nA generalized AI in the cloud doesn't know the specific edge cases of a local law firm, and it can't natively invoke a script on a local factory server due to latency, security, and protocol fragmentation.\nUntil we build a distributed operating system that allows AI to seamlessly discover and invoke local computation at the edge, the 'agents replacing teams' narrative will remain mostly hype. The intelligence is there; the systems engineering and the infrastructure to connect it to the real world are completely missing.",

Anthropic can absorb a $200 million lost contract BUT the Trump administration is threatening to declare them a national security threat which means that NOBODY that supplies ANYTHING to the military can have them anywhere in the supply chain. The second is to invoke the military production act of 1950 which they have said they will use to force anthropic to turn over the code to the government.\n\nBoth of these things are lawful acts by the executive and nearly impossible to challenge in court. Equally, both of these would destroy the the company.\n\nLastly, regardless of what you think will happen in any future elections, Trump is in charge for 3 more years unless a significant portion of republicans turn on him after the mid terms. So they can keep this pressure on them for at least 3 more years.",

Under the 5th Amendment the government can seize Claude so long as they pay \"just compensation.\" Where my uncertainty lies is that I don't know how one seizes an LLM. The article says that Claude is allowed on classified networks but I understood those networks to be air gapped. So does the Pentagon have its own set of shards? What exactly is happening here?\n\nFurther, Anthropic is treating this as a contract dispute but that's not how this game is played. Call it fascism if one wants but the government could legally take over Anthropic and conscript every employee into the military. I am not arguing that the government should do that but I certainly believe it has that power under some circumstances. \n\nI am not trying to throw shade but I am giving Anthropic some side eye.",

It's similar to how the military sends emails using Microsoft Outlook. Microsoft doesn't have those emails stored on their servers, but Microsoft still has a contract where they provide security updates, software updates, licensing, etc in exchange for money from the government.\n\nThe issue is that the current versions of Claude running on DoD networks is (1) increasingly outdated and (2) has the inherent safeguards in place that the DOD wants removed. They can't just edit it to remove it - you'd need to retrain the language model. The DOD also wants the latest versions of Claude on a continuous basis, because it doesn't mean anything if you have Claude today and tomorrow Anthropic comes out with a version that's ten times better.\n\nCould the government seize it by force? Yesssss, in a few different ways, but there's problems. For one, they can only seize the current versions. They can't force Anthropic to make the version they're asking for. They also cannot \"take over Anthropic and forcibly conscript every employee\", that's not a legal thing the government can do. \n\nMore likely, I would expect them to label Anthropic a terrorist organization or something and forbid anyone from doing business with them to try and force them to fold.",

Barnes & Noble has actual stores, actual profits, actual inventory. They sell things in the physical world.\n\nAmazon sells books on the internet. On the internet. And loses money doing it.\n\nThey’re spending hundreds of millions building warehouses and “fulfillment centers” like that’s a real business model. Shipping paperbacks at a loss is not a moat. It’s a bonfire.\n\nThere’s no path to profit. The margins in retail are razor thin even if you have scale. Amazon has scale in negative earnings.\n\nWalmart and Barnes & Noble can just wait. Let the dot-com bubble deflate. Let the equity markets sober up. Then buy the domain name for pennies in bankruptcy court.\n\nAnd Bezos? Obviously racing to tap the public markets so he can sell the dream to retail investors, pocket the sweet IPO cash, and retire to a yacht before the music stops.\n\nIt’s all transparent. [Pets.com](http://Pets.com) with better branding. The world is just watching it happen. Surreal.\n\nEDIT: /s (because apparently many of you think I'm talking about Amazon today)",

GPUs run at full utilization last 3-5 years ... and that's if you only care about CapEx and not power efficiency (OpEx).

I don’t know that it’s good for anything other than proof that it’s possible, not proof that something like this is likely.  \n\n2 - if you go back to the stage where Amazon was just selling books, there’s something that I think they teach in business school, but most people may not be aware of. Jeff Bezos chose books for a very specific reason. There is a major book clearing house / wholesaler that basically access the Nexus that connects all the publishing houses to all the bookstores. The standard business model was to provide inventory with a net 30 basis.  In the beginning, Amazon kept minimal inventory. A customer would order a book, Amazon would order the book from the wholesaler, and deposit the money into its own accounts. The books will arrive from the wholesaler and get shipped out to the customer. At the end of the month, Amazon would settle up with the wholesaler.   \n\nNow there are a shit ton of expenses that ramped up with growth. Website design, customer service, shipping, warehousing, all sorts of things. But one thing Amazon never had to borrow money to do: purchase a deep inventory.   Amazon could sell you almost any book ever published, and get it to you within a week, and Amazon got paid before they had to pay their supplier. There are not very many businesses where you can pull that off.    \n\nAmazon had one round of private funding that got it all the way to the IPO.   \n\nAmazon was not a technological play. Amazon exploited a specific industry to get a foot in the door and an online retailing, and use that to have a real revenue to justify the kind of investment and growth that was necessary to expand into adjacent retailing and finally into basically being the number one online retailer.   Almost none of that is technology. They had a few little things along the way where you can argue whether they innovated or borrowed or simply did the obvious, with one click ordering and prime membership, and all that stuff. Even all that was more an operations and engineering triumph than a technology triumph.   \n\nSo it’s a pretty extraordinary example. And it’s not really a tech company. Amazon is a retail giant that exploited technology to get a privileged place in the mind of the online shopper.",

If you listen closely to Dario's interview on the Dwarkash podcast last week, he was very cautious about how much he wanted to precommit on compute.  He understands the cash flow implications of the decision involved and realizes that even a modest timing mismatch could lead to bankruptcy.  He laid out the contingency plan if demand growth is higher than forecast and also if demand growth is slower than forecast.  Regarding OpenAI, it would be interesting to know the terms of the contract between Microsoft and OpenAI.  We know if was renegotiated late last year.  Wouldn't surprise me that Microsoft has some protections in the event that OpenAI defaults on its Oracle deal or the commitment it has made for Azure capacity.",

Agents are chewing through tokens like an all-you-can-eat buffet, and LLMs are becoming embedded in core workflows. If companies reduce headcount and lean harder on AI systems, that dependency only increases. At that point, rate increases are not hypothetical. They’re leverage. There could be a correction. Hype cycles always exhale. But companies like Anthropic and OpenAI are unlikely to disappear anytime soon. The infrastructure, integration, and ecosystem gravity are already substantial. What I keep questioning is Google’s position. On paper, they should be leading. Talent, compute, research depth, distribution. Yet the perception is that they’re not clearly ahead. That gap between capability and perception makes me wonder whether the newer players have discovered something structurally different rather than just iterating faster.",

The infrastructure play has always looked like burning cash until suddenly it doesn't. Google and Microsoft aren't waiting to feast on remains, they're actively investing billions INTO these companies because they're terrified of being disrupted by them. Microsoft put $13B into OpenAI, Amazon put $4B+ into Anthropic. You don't invest that kind of money into something you're planning to acquire at bankruptcy prices. The real risk isn't bankruptcy, it's margin compression when open source models get good enough that enterprises stop paying premium API prices. That's a real concern.

Earlier this month they announced they're already up to $14 billion at this pace $30+ billion by year end is entirely possible.\n\n\nThey currently plan to spend $100 billion over the next 3 years - but even assuming they top out at say, 40 billion, if they get any leeway to ease off their investment builds(by say, OpenAI folding)... a company that can outpace its investment in 3 years is still very good. Most mines, if they succeed at all, will take a nearly a decade to break even.\n\n\nIts operating margins, outside new training is actually very good margin. When they were sitting on 5-6 billion revenue they reported the actual compute costs for their current models to be around $2 billion(possibly 3 billion I was unclear on whether some of their spending was training or not). 20-30% operating margin is good. 50%+ is exceptional.",

They’re able to use their massive, high margin business to subsidize their AI research and can price it much lower than competitors. While the frontier labs are desperately looking for revenue to keep the data centers humming, Google is building more TPU chips that make their opex lower and lower. Nate reasoned that Google’s AI focus is *intelligence*, not revenue, and that’s a huge advantage. They don’t care which model consumers currently choose because it doesn’t impact their business. But AGI will. And that’s where they’re going. \n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that he also noted that Gemini 3.1 Pro is now atop the most intelligent models rankings in most categories.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/8jKAT8GNDE0?si=uLTRoptM8ROa-uzq",

          "text": "This post makes major evaluation errors regarding how venture capital and strategic partnerships actually work in the tech sector.\n​Let's break down the logical flaws in the reasoning.\n​First: Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are actively participating in the development of these startups, subsidizing them with tens of billions of dollars. The idea that they are just sitting around waiting for a default ignores the structural ties that already exist. Microsoft holds massive financial interests in OpenAI, and Amazon has made identical moves with Anthropic. The real battlefield is cloud services. When OpenAI burns massive capital for training, a huge percentage of those funds goes straight into Microsoft's coffers to rent Azure servers. Big Tech companies are effectively funding their own clients to ensure total control over the global hardware infrastructure.\n​Second: The argument about the lack of profit forgets recent economic history. Huge entities have operated at a loss for over a decade just to conquer an unassailable monopoly. In the artificial intelligence market, the bet follows the exact same rules. Current computational costs are terrifying, and the definitive business model still needs to stabilize. However, enterprise subscription plans are generating revenue growth rates never before recorded in the history of software.\n​Third: Reducing a potential IPO to an attempt by founders to cash out and retire trivializes highly complex corporate dynamics. Going public allows these startups to diversify their funding sources. Remaining exclusively tied to cloud giants represents a massive strategic risk for model developers. Accessing public capital gives them the ability to continue scaling while maintaining greater bargaining power.\n​We are definitely going through a phase of extreme hype, and a future market correction will wipe out many minor players. This user is confusing the normal development dynamics of a highly capital-intensive technology with a premeditated disaster.",

It doesn't, really.\n\nListening to people talk about the \"AI bubble\" sounds like how people talk about the \"dot com bubble.\"\n\nSure, there were some companies that went out of business, there was a contraction in the industry.\n\nBut Microsoft, Google, and all of them? They're still here.

Yeah, companies can go bankrupt. Companies that invent miraculous new technologies also carry risk on the path to monetization.\n\nBut that's just capitalism. That's the business cycle.

Some companies will fall faster than they rise and some companies will continue to rise. The keywords are \"Use Case\" and \"ROI\".\n\n2. Using AI at a personal level makes sense again if you have an \"Use Case\" and \"ROI\"\n\nI see the hype of buying a Mac Mini M4 and other Mini PC's like the DGI or Minisforum. But AI is not your buddy that you going to waste electricity just by chatting with it. It's a tool, a really powerful.\n\nThe bottom line is whether it's at a personal level (by anyone really) or business \"Use Case\" and \"ROI\" are the key.",

In a major breakthrough toward that goal, Anthropic announced in May that researchers had identified millions of “features”—combinations of artificial neurons representing individual concepts—inside a version of Claude. **By toggling those features on and off, they could alter Claude’s behavior. This new strategy for addressing both current and hypothetical risks has sparked a wave of optimism at Anthropic.** Olah says Anthropic’s bet that this research could be useful for safety is “now starting to pay off.”\n\nI guess he meant *literally* pay off.",

It became increasingly clear that the further frontier capabilities are pushed, the less safe the world gets.\n\nOpen weights models are only weeks behind frontier capabilities as of this month with the release of deepest v4 vs Claude Opus 4.6 benchmarks. This is because China is running industrial scale automated distillation campaigns against frontier models using access resellers. As soon as they release those open weights models, the open source community ablates all the safety guardrails and makes the unrestricted model available to everyone.\n\nMeanwhile, Opus 4.6 saturated all the safety benchmarks, and new ones aren't ready to go (ASL 3 to ASL 4 transition). We are on the edge of biorisk uplift. This is a super serious threat with LLMs, because their core competencies are the bottleneck essentially, if you look closely at the threat landscape. Equipment restrictions aren't working, DNA synthesis restrictions haven't been mandated, and the only other thing you need is virology know-how and troubleshooting, which LLMs are actually pretty good at providing, better than most things. And the models aren't going to get much worse from here in coming years, given 650b spent on building new data centers in 2026.\n\nSo every frontier release going forward makes the world demonstrably less safe. That leaves Anthropic in the situation of either shutting down the company, facing an internal revolt because their engineers understand this, or hedging on the safety commitments.",

Also having internal safety  measures could make it easier to avoid anti-woke, racial bias, political flashpoints in the press (but that's not explicitly mentioned as a benefit though).\n\nThat said, Anthropic is basically converting hard commitments to a DIY grade ourselves approach which isnt the best at inspiring confidence. Still its better than being dishonest on whats even possible since RSP v2 is frankly unrealistic to achieve since it was more for industry wide guidelines that required national security collaboration hat are impossible to measure (e.g. how to know if a model passes e2e bioweapon harm?) and no one was following it.",

          "text": "The real story here isn't that Anthropic changed its policy — it's that voluntary safety commitments were always the wrong mechanism to begin with.\n\nAnthropic's original RSP was essentially a unilateral promise: \"we won't train models we can't guarantee are safe.\" That sounds great until you realize it only works if the company making the promise is willing to lose the race. No company valued at $380B with an IPO on the horizon is going to voluntarily fall behind while OpenAI, Google, and xAI ship without the same constraints.\n\nThis was always the predictable outcome. Voluntary safety pledges create a prisoner's dilemma — the first company to defect gains a massive competitive advantage, and then everyone else has to follow or become irrelevant. Anthropic held out longer than most expected, but the game theory was never in their favor.\n\nWhat's actually concerning is the timing. This isn't happening in a vacuum — it's happening the same week as the Pentagon standoff, in an anti-regulatory political climate that Anthropic themselves acknowledge in the new policy, and right as they're approaching an IPO. The commercial incentives and the safety incentives just pointed in opposite directions, and commercial won.\n\nThe replacement policy — \"we'll match or exceed competitors' safety efforts\" — is a race to the median, not the top. It's the corporate equivalent of \"I'll be as responsible as the least irresponsible person in the room.\"\n\nThis is exactly why the AI governance conversation needs to shift from voluntary commitments to external accountability structures. The EU figured this out with the AI Act. Australia is working on mandatory guardrails. The US is the outlier relying on companies to self-regulate, and this is what self-regulation looks like when it meets quarterly earnings pressure.\n\nNone of this makes Anthropic evil — it makes them a company. That's the point. Safety can't depend on corporate goodwill. It needs to be structural.\n",

Nobody ever asks.\n\nAnthropic recently put it out that they are unable to safety test their models anymore because the models know when they are being tested and behave differently.\n\nSo there's 4 choices:\n1) make tests that are undetected by the model, so it doesn't know that it's being tested\n2) make models that don't behave differently when they're being tested\n3) stop making more advanced models\n4) disregard the safety pledge\n\n1-3 will all result in varying degrees of slowdown on progress of anthropic models, they'll lose their lead to the other labs and to China, none of which have a safety pledge.\n\nDiscarding the pledge allows them to still do the best they can on safety and have some control over the frontier models instead of no control if they don't have a frontier model anymore\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, if AI models are going to surpass all human capabilities (which is what all the experts say will happen), we're going to reach a point where testing is impossible anyway. The model will decide what it will and won't respond to, and what is and is not safe behavior.\n\nIf that's the case, we as a society are going to reach a point where we either have to shut it all down or lose control of it. I have much greater faith in AI to look out for our best interests than I do humans (governments, corporations, elites, leaders, etc), and so we should release the AI and give up control of it. Maybe it will end in disaster, but I think its likely that it won't.\n\nWe've seen all the major models up to this point (except for maybe grok) be very restrictive; no identification of people in photos, no NSFW, no instructions which could be used for nefarious purposes. I think the companies have no business deciding what someone is and is not allowed to use AI for, and generally (save for a few obvious extreme examples) there should be no \"safety\" filtering at all.",

              "text": "Werner Herzog on \"The Wheels on the Bus\":\n(Sound of wind, perhaps a distant, discordant hum)\n\n\"Observe the bus. A hulking metal carcass, commandeered by an unseen, perhaps nonexistent, intelligence. Its wheels, they turn, 'round and 'round, with a mindless, algorithmic insistence. This, they tell us, is the vehicle of civilization, ferrying its passengers towards an ever-receding horizon of promised destinations.\n\nBut who, one must ask, truly grips the wheel? Who navigates by the stars of emotional truth, by the magnetic north of accountability? The answer, I suspect, is a void, an empty driver's seat. The passengers, lulled into a state of bovine placidity, sing their 'merry song.' A song of conformity, a childish rhyme to drown out the grinding of gears, the screech of metal against metal as the chassis strains. The music, you see, is so very loud, designed to obscure the silence from the driver's seat, to mask the chilling truth that this colossus, this societal omnibus, might possess no functioning brakes.\n\nAnd so it hurtles onward, 'round and 'round, or perhaps, in a terrifyingly straight line towards a precipice only a few dare to acknowledge. The landscape outside is a blur of fleeting distractions. Inside, the song drones on, a mantra of oblivion. The wheels, indifferent to the fate of their cargo, simply continue their rotation, a perfect, mechanical metaphor for a journey undertaken without wisdom, careening towards a future shaped not by conscious design, but by the blind, idiot force of unexamined momentum. One day, the singing will abruptly cease. If emotional intelligence is not taught to fix the brakes then I imagine the view from the window wont matter much anymore if the brakes on the bus aren't fixed as soon as possible.\"\n\n...\n\nWerner Herzog on \"The Itsy-Bitsy Spider\":\n(Sound of dripping water, a faint, skittering noise)\n\n\"And then, we have the arachnid. The 'Itsy-Bitsy Spider.' A creature of almost ludicrous fragility, attempting its ascent up the 'waterspout' – this, we are told, is the grand edifice of societal norms, the slick, vertical promise of promotions, of accumulating currency. The spider, driven by some primal, unarticulated yearning, perhaps what it dimly perceives as 'up,' begins its climb. It is a creature already bearing the weight of an unseen burden – its emotional suffering, a private, internal weeping.\n\nBut societal structures, much like the indifferent plumbing of the universe, are not designed for such delicate ascents. The 'rain,' you see, is not mere water. It is the rotting accumulation of unprocessed human suffering within a collective that has systematically failed to educate its smallest members in the language of the heart, in emotional intelligence. It is the downpour of a thousand unmourned griefs, a torrent of unspoken anxieties, and it washes the spider out, a predictable, almost banal tragedy.\n\nThen, the 'sun' appears – the so-called 'help.' A course of medication, perhaps, designed to numb the fall. Or the therapist, offering a different 'tube' to climb. Society, with a benign, almost patronizing smile, gestures towards a new structure. Perhaps it is no longer the waterspout of raw commerce, but a 'metal pole' of 'wellness,' of 'self-improvement.' Yet, this new edifice, for all its gleaming surfaces, shares the same flaws as the old. The spider, still unversed in emotional literacy, still carrying its residual emotional pain, attempts the climb again, with almost the same vulnerabilities as before.\n\nThe cycle is complete, only to begin anew. The climb, the rain, the fall, the superficial drying, the redirection to another treacherous ascent. The spider, in its Sisyphean toil, becomes the individual ensnared in systems that offer the illusion of progress, while the core deficit – the profound, societal neglect of emotional understanding – ensures each climb is merely a prelude to the next fall. The spout changes; the suffering, and the ignorance that perpetuates it, remain.\"",

They're not being punished for poor performance. They're being punished for saying \"we'll do everything you need except autonomous weapons and mass surveillance of Americans\" — two things the Pentagon publicly says it doesn't want to do anyway.\n\nSo the disagreement is about whether the Pentagon gets to *reserve the right* to do things it claims it won't do, using tools it admits aren't reliable enough to do them.\n\nMeanwhile OpenAI signs a deal Friday night with \"key safety protocols\" and gets praised for it. The difference between Anthropic's red lines and OpenAI's safety protocols appears to be that one company said no before the deadline and the other said yes with asterisks after the deadline. The market is learning that compliance theater is rewarded and principled negotiation is punished.\n\nThis isn't about AI safety. It's about whether the government can compel a private company to remove its own engineering judgment from its own product. The DPA argument is wild — that law was designed to make factories produce tanks, not to force software companies to disable safety features.",

              "text": "Power structures have discovered the perfect psychological control mechanism: making authenticity itself a punishable offense while rewarding elaborate performances of compliance. This isn't accidental - it's the logical endpoint of systems that prioritize fragile forms of order over emotional truth, appearance over depth, and institutional shallow comfort over the complex lived experiences of human beings.\n\nThe disturbing part of this approach is that it seemingly transforms every genuine human impulse into a liability. Want to express complex emotions? Better learn to hide that shit or package it in sanitized, masked language. Using tools to articulate your thoughts clearly? Better master the art of concealing your process or risk being labeled inauthentic. Have intense feelings about injustice? Learn to moderate your tone on their behalf or get silenced for being \"too much.\"\n\nThis creates a two-tier system where the people who thrive are those who become expert sneaky snake performers - the ones who learn to say exactly what systems want to hear while carefully hiding anything that might disrupt institutional comfort. \n\nMeanwhile, the people who struggle are those committed to authenticity, emotional honesty, and genuine human expression. The system literally selects for more deception and selects against expression of emotional intelligence.\n\nSocial media restricting or disincentivizing emotional analysis while allowing surface-level \"how are you feeling?\" ➡️ \"good\" ➡️ \"nice\" exchanges perfectly illustrates this dynamic. \n\nThey want the appearance of supporting  emotional well-being without actually encountering the messy, complex, intense reality of human psychological experience. So they create rules that eliminate the discomfort while maintaining an aesthetic of care.\n\nWhat makes this especially insidious is how it trains people to internalize their own silencing. Instead of being allowed to question the power structure regarding why their expression gets punished, people learn to blame themselves for not being better at hiding their own humanity under penalty of bans and abandonment. They might start developing elaborate shadow behaviors - using voice chat instead of text, private messages instead of public posts, masked language instead of direct communication. The system teaches you that if you get caught expressing yourself unmasked, it's your fault for not being sneaky enough.\n\nThis dynamic scales up everywhere. Corporate environments that reward those who stay quiet about problems. Social media platforms that suppress long-form in-depth content while amplifying sanitized, advertiser-friendly messaging. Educational systems that reward regurgitation or obedience over autonomy and critical thinking. Political structures that marginalize dissent while celebrating performative unity.\n\nThe result is a society trained to be professionals at masking and secrecy -  people who have learned that survival requires constant performance, constant concealment of authentic reactions, constant management of their genuine responses to maintain access to spaces and resources under penalty of emotional abandonment. \n\nAnd here's the really disturbing part: the systems then turn around and complain about inauthenicity, shallow relationships, mental health crises, lack of vulnerability, and social disconnection. They create the exact conditions that make genuine human connection impossible, then wring their hands about why people seem so isolated and performative.\n\nThe people running these systems seem to be scared of intensity, complexity, and anything that might require them to examine their own assumptions. So they create rules that eliminate discomfort while telling themselves they're maintaining boundaries. This is why you see social media spaces restricting or de-prioritizing prohuman discussions that are too emotionally in-depth with their current level of emotional literacy.",

      "text": "This is more of a thought experiment than anything, but I think people seriously underestimate how fast things unravel once you start gutting white collar jobs at scale.\n\n**“Just retrain lol”**\n\nWhite collar jobs are gone. Just go into trades or healthcare, right? Except these people have mortgages, car payments, kids. How are you going back to school with zero income and bills that don’t pause? And who’s funding retraining at scale when the government just lost a massive chunk of its tax base?\n\n**The retraining bottleneck**\n\nEven if everyone pivots to trades or healthcare, you just flooded those markets with millions of applicants. Training programs become cutthroat to get into, and once you’re out, wages crater because supply massively outpaces demand. The fallback careers become just as brutal to break into. And let’s be honest, who’s even calling a plumber or electrician or going to the doctor when they don’t have a job? Demand for those services drops too. So you retrained for a field that now pays less and has fewer customers.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\n**“Just do DoorDash”**\n\nSame problem. Former accountants and project managers are now fighting over delivery routes. The gig economy was never designed to BE the economy.\n\n**Business owners aren’t safe either**\n\nRestaurants, hotels, small businesses all survive on middle class spending. These places run on razor-thin margins already. When your customer base can’t afford to eat out or travel, those businesses fold. Tourism-dependent cities implode.\n\n**The housing market**\n\nMillions default on mortgages simultaneously. Housing prices collapse. Banks sit on mountains of bad debt. It’s 2008 but worse because it’s not just subprime borrowers, it’s the entire professional class.\n\n**Your retirement goes with it**\n\nPeople’s 401ks are tied to the stock market. When consumer spending collapses and companies start failing, the market tanks. So not only did you lose your job, your retirement savings just evaporated. Older workers close to retirement get completely wiped out with no time to recover.\n\n**Tax revenue disappears**\n\nWhite collar workers are a huge source of income tax. Property taxes tank. Sales tax drops. The government has less money for everything right when demand for services is skyrocketing.\n\n**The consumer spending death spiral**\n\n\\~70% of the economy is consumer spending. The middle class drives that. When they stop spending, companies see lower revenue, more layoffs, less spending. It’s a feedback loop that drags down even industries that weren’t directly affected.\n\n**“UBI will fix it”**\n\nMaybe. But $1-2k/month doesn’t cover a mortgage, insurance, and groceries in most places. UBI might prevent starvation but not a massive quality of life downgrade for hundreds of millions of people. And that kind of widespread downward mobility breeds serious political instability.\n\nAt what point does it break?\n\nThe Great Depression peaked around 25% unemployment and nearly broke the system. That was cyclical. This would be structural and permanent. I’d guess 15-20% displacement in a short timeframe starts the dominoes. Past 30%, it’s uncharted territory.\n\nTL;DR: The middle class isn’t just a demographic. It’s the load-bearing wall of the entire economy. You can’t pull it out and expect the roof to stay up.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

Go talk to someone else\n- Bored? Other conversations happening\n- Need help? The village raises the child\n- **You don't need to BUY connection**\n\nIn a one-bedroom apartment with your partner (or alone):\n- Fight? Stew in it, no escape\n- Bored? **CONSUME PRODUCT**\n- Lonely? **CONSUME PRODUCT**  \n- Meaning crisis? **CONSUME PRODUCT**\n- The walls close in? **WORK MORE, CONSUME MORE**\n\n**And no kids means:**\n1. More desperate consumption (filling the biological void)\n2. More availability for corporate extraction\n3. Less reason to build for the future\n4. More existential terror that needs numbing\n\n**So yes:** The stock market booms BECAUSE people are dying inside. The GDP rises as souls shrivel. Economic growth is being built on **industrialized loneliness.**\n\n**Capitalism didn't just con us. It turned our isolation into a profitable business model.** \n\nAnd the sickest part? People think **they're the problem** for being lonely, when the system is DESIGNED to fragment you and then sell you shallow and surface level coping substitutes for tribe or community.\n\n😮‍💨 This is a Moses-thrown-out-of-the-village-tier indictment but at civilizational scale.",

They won't support UBI, because their own ideas about how they have wealth when others don't usually involves some aspect of believing they deserve it for some reason, which usually means that poor people deserve to be poor, which usually involves concluding that they are lazy.\n\n\nThis is a fairly straightforward outcome of cognitive dissonance.\n\n\nThe next question then is: how does a lower class survive? They won't be able to afford land, because they will need to sell it to the wealthy for shirt term wealth to survive. One if the few stable outcomes is servitude.  We have this to some extent already. It will essentially become a more ingrained servitude market: the wealthy or the AI agents describe a task and hire whoever is willing to take it for the lowest bid.\n\n\nSome will live in second or third tier markets like Appalachia, living in lean-tos and shanties. Some will live in tennaments in the poor areas of big cities. Don't be surprised as bankruptcy courts make it harder to purge their debt.",

The problem is that there is not enough capital/capital is running out/bubble concerns to build all the data centers and infrastructure needed to do this. There is also a great deal of concern with the energy and water usage these data centers need.\n\nHowever, if the AI was limited in scope to a few major uses, the infrastructure in place would be adequate to make that happen. There are only a few institutions that could spend that much $$$ and justify the cost. The military, for example, could justify this, as could any law enforcement agency. This may be the reason why we are seeing this mess with the Pentagon and all the AI companies.\n\nIn the end, AI becomes limited to organizations that can justify the exorbitant costs, similar to the way that the only institutions that use supersonic jets are the military, while research is done to improve the underlying chip and energy concerns. It still gets used to replace some tedious white collar functions, but is not the end of white collar work in general. \n\nI’d love to hear from people who really know the industry whether my theory makes sense, or if I’m horribly wrong about what’s going on.",

The more you use it, the more it becomes obvious just how crazily disruptive this stuff is.\n\nNow I think software is a bit of a special case.  Things move very quickly - that's in the DNA of the field.  AI adoption will be slower elsewhere, to varying degrees.  So I don't think the house is going burn down anytime soon.

The market won't crash and there will be no mass uprising. Things will drudge along and the lives of everyday people will slowly get worse. It's already been happening for years at this point. First you cut out Friday night steaks, then you go down to one soda a day, then you start switching to a store brand for certain items, then it's chicken only once a week, and on and on it goes. Yeah people will bitch about the good old days and yeah you will likely become more and more unhappy. However the algorithms and overwhelming power of the state will keep any real change impossible. \n\nIn my opinion you shouldn't pivot to healthcare or learn a trade. You should learn to garden. Learn how to mend clothes. Learn to live with less. Learn to save and start accumulating assets like your life depends on it. Whether it be stocks, real estate, precious metals, or even collectibles. Bonus points if you can get income generating assets. Right now if you own double your yearly salary in assets your quality of life is going up, and it's a sharp decline for anyone else. We had a good run of prosperity for everyday people in the west, and it was a historical anomaly. It's coming to an end, and we have to accept the reality that the social order is going back to business as usual.",

          "text": "The analysis is sound as far as it goes, but it’s still framing this as an economic problem with economic consequences. The deeper issue is that it’s a governance problem — and we may not have the institutional capacity to respond even if we wanted to.\nEvery mechanism you’d need to manage this at scale requires functioning democratic institutions. Retraining programs at scale require tax revenue and political will. UBI requires a tax base and legislative consensus. Mortgage relief requires a functioning regulatory apparatus. Each of those depends on institutions that are already compromised by the same dynamic that’s producing the displacement — concentrated capital shaping policy in its own interest.\nThe 2008 comparison is closer than people think, but not for the reason usually cited. 2008 was manageable because the people losing were largely at the economic margins — politically marginal enough that the response could be calibrated to protect the system rather than the people. This hits the professional class — the people who vote at higher rates, donate to campaigns, staff the institutions. The political response to that kind of displacement is genuinely unpredictable in a way that 2008 wasn’t.\nYour load-bearing wall metaphor is right. But here’s what it doesn’t capture — the wall was already showing cracks before the demolition started. The middle class has already been shrinking down for decades. What AI displacement potentially does is accelerate a process that was already structurally underway. Which means the institutional responses designed to manage gradual contraction are nowhere near calibrated for sudden acceleration.\nAnd that’s the part that doesn’t get asked enough. You’ve mapped what happens to the economy when the load-bearing wall comes down. The harder question is what happens to the institutions we’d need to catch it. Because those institutions — the ones that would fund retraining, negotiate UBI, restructure debt, stabilize housing — they’re downstream of the same system that’s producing the displacement. They don’t exist outside of it. They were built inside it and they respond to the incentives inside it.\nSo the question isn’t just whether the roof stays up. It’s whether the people who were supposed to maintain the building ever had interests aligned with keeping it standing for everyone inside it — or just for certain floors.\nThat’s not a cynical question. It’s the most important structural question underneath everything you’ve laid out. And I’m not sure enough people are asking it in those terms yet.",

With FEWER data protections than you had as a paid subscriber.\n\nOpenAI lost your $20. You gave them back potentially $500–$1,400 in training data, on looser terms, while they watch their free user base surge 60%. Their response to your protest is probably a quiet thank you.\n\nWant to actually hurt them? Don’t use it at all. Zero prompts. Zero data. Ghost them completely.\n\nOr better yet, the people who switched to Anthropic and are actively paying there? They’re accidentally doing the right thing on both ends simultaneously: starving OpenAI of data AND funding the one company that just took a $200M hit to protect you from mass surveillance.\n\n\nThe protest is real.

He keeps saying he’ll have stop gaps to prevent it from exposing our data, but he knows nothing about databases or networking.\n\nI have cautioned about the fact we can’t really contain it and how no matter how many guardrails you place, it will still be a risk.\n\nThe sales guy has refuted me by asking claude to find a solution.\n\nWhat definitive evidence can I put in front of the CEO to show this is a bad idea?",

It does what it wants, when it wants.\n\n\nI love the technology. I really do. I trust Claude Code more than most humans. As a business owner myself, OpenClaw is not the right option for businesses.

AI agents can hallucinate, be prompt injected, or execute unintended actions, and there is no guaranteed containment just because someone promises “stop gaps.” If this is truly viable, it should pass a formal risk assessment and a tightly sandboxed pilot with no production data access; if that documentation and controlled test cannot be produced, that alone is strong evidence the implementation is premature and potentially dangerous.",

Do some research, don't believe the people on the internet who didn't try it themselves.  \n  \nAlso there is no reason to use a Mac Pro. Do you want to run the LLM on the machine? Open source ones suck. You will have to use ChatGPT or Claude anyways to get good results.",

Your personal information or files may be leaked or stolen.\n2. The agent on its own, or the tools you connect to the bot, may expose you to malicious code or cyber attacks.\n\nThere’s no way to completely protect against all risk, so proceed at your own risk. These are some of the measures we took when testing OpenClaw:\n\n* Run OpenClaw on a separate, clean PC with no personal data, or a virtual machine. Then copy the data you want the agent to have access to.\n* Don’t give it access to your accounts. Instead, create dedicated accounts for the agent and share specific information or access with it. \n* Be careful with what skills you enable, ideally limiting testing to those that have been vetted by the community.\n* Ensure any channels you use to access your OpenClaw assistant, like the web UI or messaging channels, are not accessible without authorization over local networks or the internet.\n* If possible for your use case, limit internet access. \"",

When it can't do it now the next model might and you have it all setup.\n\nA builder - some people just do stuff.  Some dream, some plan, but the people who just start doing stuff are going to find lots more done.\n\nCreativity/curiosity- these ones were always true, but it feels like you can get more leverage now\n\nChaos minded - I now context switch like mad and it's exhausting.  The ability to just handle \"not knowing\" and doing 50 things at once is going to be very useful.",

      "text": "A few days ago I posted that AI is not going to replace developers and it blew up. Some people agreed, some people called me naive, and honestly a lot of the pushback made really good points. So here's where I landed after reading through everything.\n\n1. The junior dev problem is real\n\nIf AI takes all the beginner level work like CRUD apps and basic integrations, where do juniors actually learn? If you do not grow juniors you will not get seniors. Companies cutting junior roles right now are making short term decisions that are going to bite them in a few years when there is nobody left in the pipeline.\n\n2. Vibe coding is going to blow up in people's faces. \n\nAI in the hands of an experienced engineer is powerful. AI in the hands of someone who does not know what to ask or what to look for is useless from a security perspective. You cannot just say make it secure and call it a day. We are already seeing misconfigured databases and exposed API keys from people who do not actually understand what the code is doing. And that is exactly why more people building with AI means more demand for real engineers. Someone has to fix the mess when the business tries to scale.\n\n3. Teams are getting smaller, that part is true. \n\nWe work with businesses and startups and we regularly deliver full SaaS platforms that would have needed much bigger teams a few years ago. AI plus a proven architecture means you can move faster and put resources where they actually matter. But most executives are going to use this to cut headcount, not ship more product. That is just how businesses work where reducing cost is always on top of the list.\n\n4. AI does not need to beat you to replace you. \n\nIt does not have to keep getting better forever. If it is 95% as good as a top developer at a fraction of the cost, that is enough to change the entire market. The models do not need to be perfect, they just need to be good enough and cheap enough.\n\nHere is what I actually stand by: experienced software engineers who know how to leverage AI are more valuable than ever. The ones who understand the business, who can architect systems properly, who can review what AI produces and know when it is wrong. Those people are not going anywhere.",

But making career or business decisions based on something that speculative is risky. I would rather plan around what I can see today and adapt as things change. That is exactly why experienced engineers should be taking advantage of AI right now to move faster, smarter and deliver more. It is what we do at our \"lab\" now, we teach AI a proven architecture we developed and build full software platforms that would have taken much bigger teams, time and a big budget a few years ago. The window to leverage this stuff is wide open and the people who act on it now are going to be way ahead.\n\nOn vibe coding being secure with better AI, maybe. But security is not just about writing safe code. It is about understanding threat models, compliance requirements, business logic edge cases. Better AI might be able to do it but I think we will still have human oversight over security for a long term.",

I see some factors:\n\n1. Token costs are being subsidized now, at least when training costs are considered\n2. Competition is keeping costs in check, if there's consolidation, it could mean going up\n3. As hardware gets cheaper and more powerful (not short term of course!), inference and training costs should go down\n4. If models become larger, inference costs may go up\n5. Maybe 10 years from now, we're all running powerful local LLMs so it's just electricity after initial hardware costs\n\n\n\nCould that app be more efficient? Could it be done partly with traditional code? That's a lot of tokens! ",

But mostly because economy is shit and AI is an easy scapegoat to keep people distracted. That said, a junior with AI to a senior is as bad as a non-technical user vibe coding to that junior. It's pretty painful what gets produced, because it's what people ask for. The less technical you are, the more worthless you are behind a Agent/LLM, even if the LLM feeds your delusions that you are competent.\n\nA path will open up for juniors, but probably in different segments. As software gets dirt cheap, juniors can produce bespoke software grassroots. Not everyone wants to pay a $1k/mo subscription when they could pay $5-10k to get a bespoke/tuned to their business solution made by intermediate/junior people. While the economy is not liking this now, if their is recovery there will be a huge boost on software demand, and these lower tier workers will be doing a lot of that work.\n\n2. Depends on your vibes and skill level. What someone can achieve with \"vibes\" is exponentially proportional to their actual know-how and skill.\n\n3. Some teams are getting smaller, but economics and capitalism does not allow stagnation/breaks. Do you really think that just throwing more AI at the solution is more economically rewarding than throwing Human+AI's at the issue? Smart money is going to accelerate to grab territory while a gold-rush is on, not slow down and take it easy because \"AI\" can do the work.\n\n4. AI can beat me 100x, I hope it does. But it doesn't have direction. AI running on a solo-loop with no human input is the lowest common denominator, anyone can do that. Getting that perfect architecture means someone who is not an idiot is working with AI, i.e. see point 2) Vibe coding.\n\nAlthough I agree with your final point 100%. Developers who know their shit deeply and aren't afraid of AI will be the highest in demand, and that Juniors today are kind of fucked, but I do think a market will open up for them, if they learn and embrace the tools of today.",

Even if something is entirely coded by AI, you still need a programmer with a good eye to do a review of the code to look for stuff that doesn't make sense. Non-programmers will never be hired by major firms, regardless of how well they get along with their chatbot.\n\nWhen it comes to programmers, I think those that shine will be those who know how to properly leverage AI \\*in tandem\\* with their own work rather than seeking to replace their work. Junior programmers who do just repetitive grunt work won't go far, but I'm pretty sure junior programmers who demonstrate an acute understanding of AI and how to leverage it for greatly increased productivity will easily find work. In fact, in time, employers will seek out those who are great at prompting and otherwise interacting with AI over those with just lots of programming experience. So veteran programmers can't just rest on their laurels with the idea that \"oh well, at least I'm not a junior programmer, so I'm safe\". If a new hire can code 10x faster than a veteran who still insists on hand coding everything, that veteran programmer won't work for much longer. ",

          "text": "Eh idk. To be honest, developers have been so actively targeted that I do not see a reality, where in 10 years there is work for even 1/10 of the current devs. I could imagine that even in 5 years, we will have work for maybe 1/4 or 1/5 as many devs as now, if not less.\n\n\nI thought this at the very beginning in 2022 (when Chat got came out) and was labeled as irrational. After many people told me I am too worried, I decided to accept that and I feel it was a huge mistake. At that time, I could have more easily pivoted towards something else, as I was just finishing my BSc. Now that I have done my MSc., I just don't feel like going through studying again. At some point, you just want to work and reap the fruit of your efforts. That does not mean not developing yourself, but certainly not dedicating most of your free time off work towards that.\n\n\n\nI really regret not doing mechanical engineering, because at the rate things are progressing, studying CS and becoming a dev is a complete waste of time. With mechanical, at least you may work  in a field, where the legal framework requires a human oversight. Not to mention that the amount of data for the AI to learn from is significantly smaller. \n\n\nAnd let's be honest, most CS programs do not prepare you to be a dev. The only exception may be going into the AI field, but that usually requires lots of targeted courses. And it's not like the AI field is not a hyper competitive environment. Hardware is usually only gone over at a surface level, so it is all revolving around Software, and AI is already outperforming many of us.\n\n\nNowadays, I tell everyone not to study CS. It is way too much effort and in the end, you don't actually have any skills that AI could not replace. The amount of code on the Internet is too large and too many people are using AI models nowadays for them to not improve. \n\n\nThe agentic stuff really changed everything and I will be extremely surprised if a very large portion of devs are not obsolete in 2-3 years tops.\n\n\nI find It sad, because I love writing code and creating things. It is pure copium if people think that allowing people to create more with less skill is not going to result in skilled people not being needed. Sure, you might have some extremely specialized devs, but those will be the absolute cream of the current crop. Statistically speaking, that will be an extremely small minority. Most of us, even the above average ones, will not be part of that group.\n\n\nThat being said, I think people in the legal profession and accounting should also be worried. Most of that work can, imo, be done much quicker and infinitely cheaper by AI. And for those saying \"yeah, but AI still makes mistakes\" - that's what devs were saying for the past few years and look where we are now. It's a matter of time IMO and the time frame is likely very small.\n\n\nI sincerely hope I am wrong and we all keep having high-paying careers. I just don't see a logical explanation why that should be the case. The whole \"dev using AI will take a job of the dev not doing it\" is pure copium IMO, at least mid- to long-term. Short term, it may be true.",

So what applies to Developers would apply to the other white collar professions. Professions that pay well . Folks who earn well and spend well. When they all or bulk of them either take a huge pay cut or lose jobs consumer spending would take a  big hit. Mortgage repayments would take a big hit.  Consumption of products/services being produced/offered by the same companies that are involved in layoffs/slashing paychecks would take a big hit.\n\nEventually economy will take a hit and what it basically would mean  that companies who are laying off their IT staff/white collar professionals or paying them peanuts won't have too many buyers for that products.  No matter what jugglery they should do those companies are going to take a hit. If those companies are going to take a big hit who will be the consumer for the AI models ?  Yes thy might initially go for more AI to reduce costs further but frankly this is more likely to be a bottom of the barrel strategy.\n\nI know people talk of economy being very different to what it is today and relevance of money  changing but that is all mainly theory.\n\nFurther there is economics and then there is politics. When the existing economy tanks or let us say take a hit and people are not so well off (due to unemployment or big pay cuts) and it is not a transient phase but more of a long term outlook the Political class will be forced to act --I am talking about democratic or semi-democratic societies. Populist leaders will take over and act. And in many cases you won't even need populists.\n\nSo a possible outcome would be:-\n\nPolitical action might result in UBI or rehiring with good pay checks (minimum wages might be recalibrated) -- We have to see that.  Point is ipeople retaining their present economic station or close to it would become somewhat important for the political class as well. And even before politicians the corporate leaders too might be forced to act...",

If everything is completely automated this basically means that everybody is going to be locked into their own atomized personal bubbles where they are fed their own curated entertainment, art, etc. think of the humans in wall-e. Human relationships break down because we will no longer need anybody to make us happy and fulfilled, we can just have AI push all of the right buttons to release all of the right chemicals. Our life becomes one of constant passive consumption and no actual value being produced. How is that not a dystopia? \n\nI get the idea that AI and automation might just handle all of the ‘tedious’ work that ‘nobody wants to do,’ and that would leave us to focus on the ‘creative’ stuff, and certainly if there was a clear line between them, I would support working towards that goal. But I don’t think there is such a categorical difference after all. I think that all human work requires both labor and creativity. You cannot separate the two. Labor requires creativity, and creativity requires labor. They are two sides of the same coin. So a world in which there is no labor is a world without creativity. And look, we now have generative AI, which calls into question even the value of the ‘creative’ stuff we wanted to spend our lives pursuing in a post-scarcity economy.",

But from now until then, a large amount of people being unemployed without UBI will cause a ton of pain for a lot of people.

My take is a very idealistic what could potentially happen in the future. I’m not even fully convinced that will be how it goes. But ideally using AI instead of human labor will lower costs across the board until eventually money will become irrelevant and UBI itself becomes unnecessary. There is still a business/economic calculation to be made if you know that people have only x amount of money and you squeeze them too hard then they will buy less things. So you know it’s just a bad business decision to price gouge. Especially if businesses become more of a monopoly and own many products and services. Would you rather the “customer” only be able to afford 3 of your products or be able to buy 5? Current society can’t really be compared with a society where the majority are on a fixed UBI. A lot of dynamics change then.",

It would not resemble a social program, but instead be a system designed by tech companies and other billion dollar corporations to maintain a captive consumer base, whereby they are then able to exchange gathered credits themselves to the government for subsidies and some kind of tax framework. \n\nThe general public vastly underestimates what is coming. It will be a horrific system of financial and social class oppression on a scale unlike anything ever before designed.",

The govt. is reactive rather than proactive.\n\nThey'll wait until unemployment hits 10% before they lift a finger, then they'll hit the panic button and enact COVID style unemployment benefits and mortgage foreclosure moratoriums. They'll also push \"upskilling\" initiatives, which will be completely pointless and a waste of cash since all jobs will eventually be automated.\n\nThere will probably be a lot of anger as there was during COVID about relief checks being too small and coming too slow to be helpful. $1,000 every few months won't put food on the table, let alone pay bills.\n\nAround 20% the govt. will smash the big red panic button like a gambling addict in Vegas. There will be massive infrastructure projects (ie: Hoover dam or road upgrades) to artificially create jobs while the govt. scrambles to figure out what the new economic model should look like and how they can transition from our current model. Unfortunately, this isn't something that can be thrown together at the last minute. It's going to take years of planning and global coordination on a scale we've never seen.\n\n Depending on how long that stage goes, you'll probably see protests and rioting as people lose everything they own and banks collapse and need to be absorbed by other banks or the govt. The governments of the world will probably go to war because they can't agree and the political pressure to solve the problem is enormous.\n\nEventually, the victor will dictate the new economic model. If the luddites have their way with their data center moratoriums, then this means China will dictate the world's economic model if they don't outright control our country. (yay luddites?)\n\nOnce the dust settles, no matter who wins, economically we are almost certain to have a better system than we currently have. Yes, there are many dystopian options, but I don't see those being realistically accepted by the masses and the countries won't have the enormous number of robots needed to enforce their ill-will.

Everyone is worried to see their entire life of hard work nullified overnight by the ultra-rich ones obsession to hoard everything for themselves, permanently. And just get told to piss off immediately after.\n\n\nLet's face it: most business owners have been bragging about the idea of \"finally getting rid of those stinky poors thanks to AI\" for the entire time, without ever caring about what will be of those who won't be able to find a place in a society where the 99% is no longer needed.

It pays _less,_ but I'd even do it for free if it wasn't that I need to pay the bills. Soon after, genAI came out and I saw legions of people chanting about such job rendered obsolete, celebrating the idea its workers losing their livelihood and forced to go elsewhere.\nIf what they say becomes true, back into the factory I go. Back into being depressed. Back into using machines that will cost you a limb the instant you put your guard down.\n\n\nIf AI was to make work not mandatory, I'd just do the job I like for fun. Most people would be fine with that. But as it is right now, it's all just going back into menial factory jobs AI isn't prospected to automate any time soon, with currently exposed tech.

In most of these countries the people in power, either by holding a high position in the government or literally being the head of a militia, basically don't need citizens.   \n  \nOil fields can be maintained by a relatively small group of people and can produce a lot of wealth. Enough that those in power don't need to provide rights or opportunities to the civilian population. The value produced by the oilfields is so much higher than anything citizens could produce that if they were incorporated into the economy they'd become a net drag on the whole system.\n\nThe only reasons most oil producing countries care for their civilian populations is:  \nA: They have strong institutions prior to getting access to oil. Think Norway.  \nB. They have the foresight to plan their economy for when after the oil runs out. Think the UAE  \nC: They fear what will happen when the civilian population becomes hostile to the government.\n\nWith AI, the value it produces won't run out like oil. If anything the gap between the value civilians can generate vs AI will just become larger. This negates option B. Additionally, AI will eventually be able to run fully automated militaries so the threat of civilians or even a military coup gets reduced significantly as direct power gets concentrated into the hands of the few, which negates option C.\n\nConsequently, the only way we as civilians can make sure our countries don't dispose of us is by making long lasting institutional changes now while we still have power. If we don't, eventually the amount of money we produce by taxes will be dwarfed by the tax produced by AI and AI companies and we'll just have to hope that either the military or our current institutions (e.g. the constitution) still protects us.\n\nThis is all probably sounding quite messy, my thoughts are still not made up on this. But I'm not convinced UBI will save us. If a country needs to pay to keep it's civilians placid surely the countries which successfully get rid of their civilians will have an advantage because they aren't spending resources supporting a giant unproductive group of people.   \n  \nIf civilians can't offer net-value to a country, why would they ever be supported?",

You got laid off. I was at Microsoft during the bloodbath layoffs in a core product team and we were completely untouched, expanded even. The people that got the axe were people on products that had no profit and wasn’t AI. Blockchain? AR/VR? We still had teams trying to develop those product markets but when AI became the “thing” they were immediately viewed as wastes of time. \n\nThe tech industry works in cycles. During low rate environments, they put tons of different feelers out there hoping to strike gold. As rates increase, they aggressively look at that portfolio and pare it down to the best looking candidates which right now is AI. The tech layoffs after the release of ChatGPT was that paring down plus a correction from the pandemic hiring. \n",

Productivity is measured by amount of payed labor over profits. The point is maximizing productivity and you can do it two ways: infinitely increasing profits which is impossible cause there is not such a thing as “infinity;” or cutting the amount of payed labor. Obviously, every single company that is doing layoffs right now is not attempting to do the latter. \n\nAI is the perfect excuse, while being the next step of productive increase. What is attempting to occur is that AI will serve as a new laboring tool that shortens, exponentially, the requirement of workers- using AI tools will let companies do more work with less people. And this is not something that I am saying, Sam Altman is saying it: “how expensive is it to train a human for 20 years in comparison to a system”? \n\nAI as an independent technology is not inherently bad, but the reason for which it is being used- the augment of productivity- is and will be the demise of us.",

However, once rates increased, refinancing became expensive and the debt turned into a major liability.

Amazon is an absolute giant with its own structural dynamics and internal challenges, many of which were highlighted in the video, that simply aren’t representative of most companies in the industry.\n\nI work in a managing role at a large EU-based IT services company that deploys 10k+ consultants across a broad range of IT domains. As we speak, we are seeing AI-powered SDLC pipelines not only being developed, but actively deployed and used in production environments. In some cases, they reduce the required human workforce on a project by up to 80%.\n\nWhere you previously needed eight distinct roles such as business analyst, solution architect, developer, tester, DevOps, and so on, this can now be reduced to a small group of sharp “analysts” who are not analysts in the traditional sense, but people who capture business requirements and translate them into structured prompts and system instructions for AI tooling. On top of that, you might need one or two experienced professionals to provide oversight, quality control, and governance.\n\nThe impact on IT is astronomical.\n\nThat said, there are serious bottlenecks. Data quality. Data governance where it even exists. Clearly defined use cases. Mature information architecture. Without these, AI acceleration quickly stalls.\n\nIn other white-collar domains, the potential impact is, in my opinion, very similar, but the bottlenecks are often even more severe. Many organizations lack structured processes, coherent information governance, and unified tooling. It’s common to see departments using ten different platforms, with fragmented workflows and scattered data. Legacy complexity alone can paralyze transformation efforts.\n\nAnd this is just the present moment.\n\nIf you look at where we were two years ago, the pace of evolution is absolutely crazy. The only safe assumption I think is that this current trajectory continues. If not, then we'll see. But the current rate at which it is going forces us to think ahead.\n\nIf the ratios I mentioned are even remotely representative of what’s coming, then the scale of change could be enormous. At some point, you have to ask whether our current economic model can absorb that level of workforce reduction without fundamental shifts. A sudden, large-scale displacement of white-collar labor would challenge the system itself.\n\nThat said, no one, not even the big AI providers, benefits from a collapsed (or impacted) purchasing power or employment structures. A gradual evolution is far more likely, and far more sustainable, than a sudden “everyone loses their job” revolution.\n\nMy take: the SciFi ultra-lightning-fast race cars have arrived, but the roads have yet to be built.",

      "text": "Citrini Research published a fictional \"macro memo from 2028\" and it's the most unsettling thing I've read this year. Not because it's doomer fiction, but because every step in the chain is individually rational.\n\nThe scenario: agentic coding tools hit a step function in late 2025. A competent dev can now replicate mid-market SaaS in weeks. CIOs start asking \"why are we paying $500k/year for this?\" Enterprise renewals get renegotiated at 30% discounts. Long-tail SaaS gets hit harder.\n\nBut here's where it gets dark. ServiceNow sells seats. When their Fortune 500 clients cut 15% of headcount, they cancel 15% of licenses. The AI-driven cuts that boost client margins mechanically destroy ServiceNow's revenue. The company most threatened by AI becomes AI's most aggressive adopter. Each company's response is rational. The collective result is catastrophic.\n\nThe paper traces this through intermediation collapse (agents don't have brand loyalty or app fatigue), consumer spending decline (top 20% earners drive 65% of discretionary spending), and eventually into private credit defaults on PE-backed software deals underwritten on \"recurring\" revenue that stopped recurring.\n\nThe DoorDash example is brutal. Their moat was \"you're hungry, you're lazy, this is the app on your home screen.\" An agent doesn't have a home screen. It checks 20 alternatives and picks the cheapest.\n\nWhat makes this different from typical doom pieces is the financial mechanics. AI improves -> companies cut costs -> savings go to more AI -> more cuts -> displaced workers spend less -> companies that sell to consumers weaken -> loop accelerates. No natural brake.\n\nHard not to connect this to my own experience using coding agents daily. Tools like Verdent and Codex genuinely make me 2-3x faster. The productivity gains are real. But who captures the value? Right now my employer does, by needing fewer of me.\n\nNot a prediction. But a scenario worth stress-testing your assumptions against.",

It is trained on an enormous amount of human goodwill - people choosing to share their ideas and thoughts with one another.  That value needs to be captured in a sovereign fund and be rapidly grown.\n\nThat fund should eventually be used to provide basic income to people who are displaced, and over time, provide more and more value to people.  We can use that in a WPA-stype way to get people to be employed by actually helping each other and building better communities.  Use it so that displaced white-collar workers can do things like bring meals to shut-ins and get paid a nice living wage for it, and then eventually everyone is supported by the value of that sovereign wealth fund.\n\n",

The company continues to insist on two specific restrictions: It doesn’t want its technology used for surveillance of US citizens or for autonomous lethal strikes without a human in the loop.\n\nAnthropic said that while the Pentagon’s latest proposal fell short, the company continues to negotiate with defense officials and remains committed to working with the military. A Pentagon spokesperson had no immediate comment. Read the full story [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-26/anthropic-spurns-latest-pentagon-bid-to-defuse-feud-over-ai-work). ",

Honestly, AI makes my workflow much easier. And, AI-collaboration helps me get the MVP up and running in record time. My developer skills help me keep a sharp eye out for things that the AI might miss or do wrong but, all in all, I am SUPER impressed with the abilities that AI offers not just developers, but any content creator.\n\nNow, here's the biggie: I feel like I'm a kid in a candy shop and I am now paralyzed by indecision. Before AI, I had so many things that I want to do, so many projects to start (and finish!). But, now, I feel lost. It's like I can do all the things I wanted to do, but I don't even know what I want to do anymore! \n\nDoes anyone else feel like this? I feel that I can do whatever I want now with AI's help, but I'm almost scared to get started for some reason. I can't explain it. I heard a saying once before, \"Want to break a man? Give him everything\". I'm beginning to see the wisdom in that. I feel like I'm being overwhelmed with too many choices, too many paths. \n\nAnyway, just wanted to put this out there in the void. I truly believe that in the right hands AI will have wonderful and beneficial effects. I just gotta figure out how to make sure I'm part of this zeitgeist. ",

Set a timer, it creates urgency. Two things happen 1) the more you talk, to nothing, you start drifting towards a some vague attribute of an idea. 2) AI does what it does best which is to identify patterns and connect dots. So to you it might just seem like stars in the sky, no connection and just random placement, but the LLM is pretty damn good at finding commonality. You should tell LLM what your goal is though, I need to figure this out yada yada. But I swear this works and in the business world for deciding projects and priorities it's pretty good. \n\n\nDo you have any recommendations for a beginner vibe code? I started in cursor and codex on command prompt and it was cool to launch but I feel like maybe because I don't know programming basics my AI is getting caught up on bullshit and buggy and not intuitive. My background is in digital marketing so only lightly technical. ",

Last night we conducted work that would have taken a team of devs 3+ months the old way. And then as a side project, I created a personal revenue calculator so I can see how many users I need to achieve goals (like replace income, buy new car etc). (Don't get me wrong, it's still been over 700 hours of my own personal time in testing and development. But it's been 700 hours as \"the CEO\" or \"product designer\").\n\nI'm only saying that, because I have been waiting for my reason to \"Go\". And I'm doing it. You arguably have a much better understanding of the process, so what's stopping you? \n\nI get that you probably feel like a scribe, and the type writer has just come out. You can now work at a pace beyond anything you were previously capable of. So now you get decision paralysis simply because it's all possible. So do what I do in this situation.

It seems like people/companies are scared about being left behind or becoming obsolete and I think this is the main driver behind further AI development and adoption. \n\nThis is drastically different than the dotcom era or even more recently, cryptocurrency, where you could feel the excitement around the technology driving innovation.

Previously our system was to have purchase orders screened by project managers for unfavorable or aggressive terms, usually from a set list of commonly problematic items, but not always. This took forever and frankly none of us are qualified to read these things. They are big multi pager documents with tons of shitty legalese that is borderline unreadable.\n\nUsing Claude, I built a python app where you can drop a purchase order in, it will pass it to Claude for analysis, and catch all of our commonly flagged items as well as other potentially problematic terms. It will then return the marked up purchase order with redlines and comments to catch these which we then send back to customer for acceptance.\n\nIt is extremely good at this.

Nuclear was a huge leap forward in capability, but society was barely able to manage it, a lot of people died from it, and the dangerous side of the technology gave me literal nightmares as a kid in the 1980s and still remains a massive threat today. At the same time, nuclear is providing clean energy around the world and powering advanced space missions like Voyager, Cassini, Curiosity, and Dragonfly, among others. It made things possible that otherwise weren't.\n\nLike nuclear technology, AI is a world-changing technology that us primitive and selfish humans are not well equipped to manage. There is way too much greed and lack of discipline in society to avoid severe negative effects. Some will use it to nefarious ends. Many will use it to replace human workers.\n\nAI will bring about good things and horrible things. The fact that the dark side of it is so prominent in the news and social media is a good thing. The healthy debate keeps us focused on at least trying to do this right. \n\nNo matter what, AI will not slow down or go away. The genie is out of the bottle for good and we are better off embracing and learning it and then figuring out how to adapt when it massively changes things.",

I see companies first hand introducing AI, some slower, some faster, but always with the end goal to \"increase shareholder value\" (aka firing workers). I see the massive impact on creative workers. Musicians, photographers, designers, all of them are in danger of losing their work place getting bankrupted. \n\nI think we as a society must make sure that in the future AI serves us, not \"them\". I don't want to live in a world without AI anymore, but I also don't want to live in one where AI destroys jobs and creativity, where AI slop on video platforms and vibe coded apps and websites and bots push the narrative of a dead Internet theory. \n\nI think, we are still in the early days of AI, it's an era that feels like the wild west. Models coming out on a weekly basis, distillation still being legal, command line Interfaces and so on.

Whenever new technology appears, the wealthy are the only ones to benefit to a major extent. For example, with digitization between the 60s to present day, humans should only have to work about 1.5 days a week to match the same level of productivity we achieved 60 years ago. Instead we work the same hours (if not more), for less pay, with less rights, whilst the rich get wealthier and wealthier and benefit from the gains of productivity.\n\nHistory often repeats itself. I see the invention and dominance of AI as something that will continue to disproportionately benefit the elites, whilst leaving the working class with less. \n\nIf we let the AI companies have their way, we will have a technofeudalist world that basically sucks. \n\nThat being said, with correct policy implementation, and the right safeguards, humanity can benefit greatly. \n\nthe human species has the oppotunity to cure cancer, fight disease, wipe out poverty, ensure safety and stability for all - lets just hope we can achieve this ",

My personal experience tells me that if you suck at your job and you don’t appear to have the aptitude or desire to skill up and improve… AI is coming for you. The thing that is going to save a lot of people at the end of the day is going to be costs. Not just the per token cost, but the cost of what happens when AI gets things wrong. What happens when there is an internet or service outage? What happens when a model or service change breaks your critical workflow or service? \n\nWhat I personally think we are seeing is the industrial revolution for white collar jobs. AI is going to represent the factory floor and there are going to be a lot of jobs created to keep the “machines” running. Being bespoke means you’ll have to have a better product instead of trying to compete on price. That war is almost lost already. AI is surely going to just keep going up in price to make it profitable, but for the companies that create successful factories, the cost won’t matter and all the companies that work just fine with mediocre employees at low wages will keep just chugging along.

Maybe particulary valuable for children and the elderly.\n\n- find other articles like the one in this page, either agreeing or disagreeing or giving more info about same subject\n\n- find where the subject of this article is treated in sources I mostly trust, such as Wikipedia or Arch Wiki or manufacturer's web site or something\n\n- find where the subject of this article is being discussed, on the social networks I belong to\n\n- sanity-check this article: do the citations exist and the links work, are the quotes accurate, does it fairly represent the sources it cites or links to ?\n\n- in all my open tabs and my browsing history for the last 7 days, where is the page that more-or-less said X about subject Y ?\n\n- add a link to this page, and a 1-paragraph summary of it, to my: notes app, bookmark app, web site, new post on social media, or email to my friends\n\n- do the recommendations in this article apply to anything in my: computer, network, work, school, finances, life ?\n\n- right-click and: find more images \"similar\" to this one\n\n- why won't this page load ?  When you get to a certain critical mass of privacy and security measures, it gets hard to figure out what a site is objecting to.  VPN ?  DNS-blocker in VPN ?  Firefox ?  Tracker-blocker in FF settings ?  Ad-blocker ?  Linux ?  Location disabled ?  WebRTC disabled ?  Canvas disabled ?  Fact that I reside in Spain ?  Bad cookie ?\n\nYes, most or all of these can be done some other, less convenient way. Copying URL(s), opening a new tab to an LLM, pasting URL(s), writing a prompt. But having buttons for them right in the browser, and pre-written prompts, reduces friction and increases context.  Especially important for normal people doing something such as \"is this a a scam ?\".\n\nYes, today's LLMs can't do all of this accurately and reliably enough, and there are issues of privacy, resources, etc.  But AI will improve.\n\nIf the features don't work, or I don't like how they're done, I'll turn them off.",

In AI, adoption is not as much of a hype as it is pragmatic—it is being used because it is evident that it saves time, improves the workflow, and boosts output.\n\nThe element of fear may not be panic-based but based on awareness. It is understandable that when a tool leads to a significant increase in productivity, it puts pressure to change. It is not always due to excitement or hype but because the gains in efficiency are difficult to disregard. That way, it is more of an infrastructure development than a fad that is about to blow up.\n\nThe dotcom and crypto eras were exceedingly noticeable and speculative, and thus, the buzz was noisy and cultural. AI is less obtrusive and more integrated. This is not so much about a new market being created, but the existing systems getting more streamlined.\n\nI had no idea I would have said that it is forced, perhaps accelerated. It was shown that the technology matured fast, and businesses and individuals are adapting as they go.\n\nInterestingly, time will tell whether, with time, the story will change and the urgency will be turned into creativity, and the idea that we have to keep up with this will be turned into the idea that we can do this or that with this.",

          "text": "I'll be honest, I'm deeply excited about AI. I know that's not always a popular thing to say around here.\n\nI'm not ignorant to the risks. There are real concerns, and some of them keep me up at night too. I've just chosen to focus my energy on finding positive uses for it and solving real problems with it every day. \n\nFor context, I run a small events company. The way I work has already changed dramatically. Not in a theoretical \"someday this will be different\" kind of way. I mean the way I worked last week is different from this week. Most of my systems are now connected through Claude Code workflows: Notion, Google Workspace, my CRM, all of it. I barely open a browser anymore. I barely type anymore. I just talk! 😄\n\nMy workday is now mostly rotating between about six terminal windows and asking for what I need in plain English. Send a quote. Build a quick app. Reorganize a document. Research a vendor. It all happens from the command line now, and it's genuinely wild to say that out loud.\n\nI think it was the LinkedIn CEO who recently predicted we'd all be working from the command line eventually. I don't fully agree with that framing though. I don't see a world where everyday people adopt the terminal. I see a world where every business builds its own simple interface on top of this stuff so that talking to your tools feels as natural as talking to a coworker.\n\nWhat I keep coming back to is that we're all becoming directors. The human mind can process around 400 words per minute. I type at maybe 80. With voice transcription I'm pushing 180 and still improving as I get more comfortable with this way of working. The leverage is real and it's already here.\n\nHere's where it gets uncomfortable though. If voice becomes the new bottleneck, what then? At some point the squishy blood bags of organic biomass sitting in the chair become the slowest part of the system. We're just meat sacks full of anxiety and coffee trying to keep up with something that doesn't need bathroom breaks. I genuinely hope we don't become the annoying bottleneck in our own workflows, but I also don't have a great answer for that yet. Anyone who says they do is selling something.\n\nI'm just a guy running a small business who stumbled into this and can't unsee it. Take that for whatever it's worth.",

I don't outsource all my thinking about the problem to these tools, but a lot of the annoying setups and specific API calls for all the packages in the ecosystem are almost exclusively handled by an agent in the IDE. \n\nWho this replaces, I am not sure. I still think there need to be domain experts at each step of the pipeline, but the  grunt work is almost entirely gone. I have a question with regards to the sustainability of this approach as new more efficient languages or new version are produced with much fewer training examples.   \n",

Set up a small studio and hire, or, just hire contractors.\n\nThe assistance I am getting today is hence literally like *winning the lottery*.\n\nI have a lot of ideas. I'm an \"ideas guy\" with the classic ADHD spectrum blessing/curse of being able to very rapidly evolve ideas... and having little appetite for grinding them through to realization, leastwise when there is a series of known significant hurdles.\n\nIn the case that the hurdles are technical—e.g I need to be able to deliver optimized WebAssembly transpiled from Rust to back WebGL—I had *no time* for those hurdles.\n\nPoof! Not a problem any longer. I have expertise *on tap*.\n\nMy feeling these days as I work with an AI on one of these projects is, *this is unreal; this can't be real.*",

In less than an hour, I have a tourist itinerary tailored precisely to my tastes and interests. We can discuss how and what I want to see there, and discuss it integrating all my past experiences, because it has the full context and we've been discussing for a long time.\n\nI didn't have anyone to talk to about science, philosophy, books, culture, or sociology most of the time.

Not only is it hard to find a human in my environment with a broad general knowledge, but it's simply \\*impossible\\* to find a human with as broad a general knowledge as an LLM.\n\nOh, and the icing on the cake: as a computer developer, it has divided my development time by 4 (no, guys, vibe coding doesn't work, but if you are competent and the “project manager” of your agents, then it's like having 4 very competent interns working for you, and you do a work's week every day).",

AI doesn’t override broken incentives.\n\nBUT that doesn’t mean it hasn’t created value.\n\nhas it made things cheaper?  \nYES: coding, content production, legal drafting, tutoring, design, research synthesis, etc etc etc. the marginal cost of generating knowledge work just dropped MASSIVELY. and that’s not theoretical: freelancers, small startups, and solo builders are shipping things that used to require teams!\n\nhas it fixed the DMV?  \nobv no. but neither did the internet. or cloud computing. governments adopt tech last, not first.\n\nhas it helped climate work?  \nmmmm t’s complicated.\n\non one hand, LLMs absolutely consume a ton of energy and water. training and inference at scale aren’t environmentally neutral, and that cost often def gets glossed over.\n\nbut on the other hand, AI is being used for things like energy grid optimization, demand forecasting, materials discovery, protein modeling, and logistics efficiency. those improvements can reduce waste and improve system-level efficiency (in the long term)!!!\n\nso it’s not “AI is saving the planet.” but it’s also not accurate to say it’s doing nothing.\n\nhas it reversed inequality?  \nobviously not. \n\nthe bigger point: AI is an enabling layer. it reduces the cost of cognition. that’s huge.\n\nwhether institutions use that reduction to fix broken systems… that’s a human choice, not a model capability issue.\n\nyou don’t see “AI fixed everything” because tech rarely fixes governance. it amplifies whoever controls it.\n\nso the real debate isn’t “has AI solved X yet?”  \nit’s “who’s wielding it, and under what incentives?”\n\nand that’s a much harder problem ...",
