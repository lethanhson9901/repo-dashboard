I'm still not clear on what our policy is on posters 'abusing' LLMs to write just total non-sense self-promo posts [like this one from other day.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qz6zi3/i_built_a_fully_local_opensource_ai_workspace/o4am45l/?context=10000) -- I think that should clearly fall under the low-effort rules and the ton of posts like this one. Dude couldn't even get Claude to speak straight about what he's 'created', I didn't waste time going through source code but lord knows what dangers lurk in there.\n\n[I don't think this amazing malware vibe dev](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qfpfoy/orchestra_multimodel_ai_orchestration_system_with/o07em3u/) ever got followed up on after I sent in a mod mail about them. They blocked me, screamed at me that it wasn't a security issue, then their LLM fixed it and noted it was an extreme security issue, got uppity that I had ruined their post, so then they deleted the post and reposted it same day. Just clicking on that guys profile is a wild ride, and I guess he'll be back again with his next vibe coded vulnerability to peddle.\n\nThe current quality bar is so, so low, I know the ultra-spammy and psychotic project posts are getting cleaned up, but even the ones that remain are, wow. I think posts related to projects need to have like, 10x times more stringent rules. The first one being if the entire body of your post is LLM generated, its deleted. It just doesn't make any sense, if LLMs let you code it 100x faster then why don't they have 5 minutes to write a post about it? It's counter intuitive on an 'AI sub' to ban for AI use, but users don't come here to interact with LLM bots and people who act like LLM bots.",

It involves taking a large, complex model (called the teacher model) and transferring its knowledge into a smaller, more efficient model (called the student model).The distilled model is trained to mimic the predictions of the larger model while maintaining much of its accuracy. The main benefits of distilled models are that they: 1. Require fewer resources: They are smaller and faster, making them more efficient for deployment on devices with limited computational power. 2. Preserve performance: Despite being smaller, distilled models often perform nearly as well as their larger counterparts. 3. Enable scalability: They are better suited for real-world applications that need to handle high traffic or run on edge devices.",

Nothing super quantifiable but vibe:\n\n* Faster - to be expected I guess given only Max has access\n* Longer running thinking & more interleaved thinking and doing\n* It really likes making lists. Same for presenting things visually in block diagrams and lists. Opencode doesn't seem to always read the tables as tables right though so there must be some formatting issue there\n* More thinking style backtracking thought patterns (\"Actually, wait - I need to be careful\")\n* Seems to remember things from much earlier better. e.g. tried something, it failed. Then added some features and at end it decided on its own to retry the earlier thing again having realised the features are relevant to failure case\n\nKeen to see how it does on rust. Was pretty happy with 4.7 already in general but on rust specifically sometimes it dug itself into a hole\n\nOverall definitely a solid improvement :)",

Unfortunately the account was deleted recently, making it difficult to find all the latest posts on that.\n\nSo, visualizing static properties clearly has its benefits, and another take at the dynamic visualization could also yield nice results.",

Also K2.5 has better performance on my rig and can run losslessly as Q4_X quant that just maps the original INT4 weights, while GLM-5 has to be quantized from BF16 since they did not do 4-bit QAT or at least FP8 training.\n\n\nThat said, GLM-5 is still a good models in its own way, it has its own flavor both in programming and creative writing, so some people may prefer it for their use cases. I am keeping it in my toolbox too because it may provide different solutions should I need them, compared to K2.5.",

Its training is outdated.\n\nI haven't use enough open weight models professionally yet to know their vibe, but if they feel good to use and can handle long agentic tasks, the major US labs will struggle to be competitive.",

Outside of the benchmark, we are hearing  from many people in the community how close the gap between open source and close source are. \n\nAnd myself  have multiple experiences where Kimi 2.5 beat Opus 4.6 \n\nFor example, I asked both models to create a PDF summarizing randomized SVD, explaining it geometrically and show its derivation. Not only did Kimi do a better job explaining the theory it also has less latex error and presents the material in a more logical order.",

I'm squarely in the GLM club and use it for everything personal, whereas I use claude for work. \n\nGLM-5 and Kimi-K2.5 are close to Claude Sonnet 4.5; not Opus 4.5\n\nOpus 4.6 is just miles ahead. Just fact - look at it's reasoning tokens vs GLM reasoning tokens, or how fast it adapts to your conversation. Opus is highly token efficient, very rounded in world knowledge, and a great example of self-steering with minimal supervision (ie you can ask it to generate conditions and have it reference/update/follow them the same way people can).\n\nHowever that doesn't mean GLM isn't going to catch up - it's a time saturation thing. I'm betting in 5 years we'll likely have relatively similar AI capabilities across the board amongst models, and their differentiator will be in the ways they're integrated/tuned for their specific applications.",

If you take them slightly out of the typical benchmark cases, they get lost way more than SotA models. Not to mention useful context and world knowledge, where goog is king still.

For coding benchmarks (SWE-bench, HumanEval+), open models like GLM-5 and DeepSeek are basically neck and neck with Opus. For creative writing and instruction following, proprietary still has an edge. For math/reasoning, it depends heavily on whether you enable chain-of-thought.\n\nThe interesting question is: does it even matter anymore for 70-80% of production workloads? Most real-world API traffic is classification, extraction, summarization, translation — tasks where even much smaller models perform identically to frontier. The gap only matters for the genuinely hard 10-20% of queries.\n\nIMO the real win from this convergence is that developers now have *options*. Two years ago you basically had GPT-4 or nothing.

Now the calculus is completely different.\n\nFor most production workloads the interesting question is not which model is best on benchmarks. It is which model gives acceptable quality at the lowest total cost of ownership. And that answer increasingly favors open-weight models for the 70-80 percent of tasks that do not require frontier reasoning.\n\nThe remaining gap matters most for:\n- Extended multi-step reasoning chains\n- Complex code generation with architectural decisions\n- Nuanced analysis where missing a subtlety has real consequences\n\nFor everything else (translation, summarization, classification, simple Q&A, data extraction) the gap is functionally zero. A well-prompted GLM-5 or Qwen3 handles these identically to Opus at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe real winner from this convergence is anyone building AI applications. Competition is driving prices down across the board and giving developers genuine choices instead of single-provider lock-in. Two years ago you picked OpenAI or you were making compromises. Now you have 5-6 genuinely competitive options at every tier.",

The reward function always rewarded hallucinations. \n\nIt’s like a teenager taking a standardized test guessing filling in a random multiple choice answer, rather than leaving it blank. Does that make the teenager hallucinating? Not really, it just statistically is in the favor of the test taker if they have any information above random choice: they’re incentivized to guess at an answer. \n\nThe solution is simple, to set the reward function to favor epistemological uncertainty, and punish confident errors harshly. \n\nOpenAI basically grades answers no longer like a multiple choice test, but rather gives partial credit to correct levels of uncertainty.",

It took about 30 communications to barely get it implemented (no time to deal with the UI). I feel like it's even weaker than Sonnet 4.5... I'm not sure if it's an issue with using it through Claude Code. Also, I bought the coding plan, but there are still occasional interruptions, and I have to take over and type \"continue\". Overall, the experience is still quite far from ideal. The price is barely reasonable, but the insufficient computing power and programming ability still haven't met my passing requirements.

This gives sub-quadratic complexity for most layers while retaining full attention's expressiveness periodically.\n\nOther notable details:\n- **Partial RoPE** — only 25% of the 256-dim head gets rotary embeddings\n- **M-RoPE** (3D position encoding: temporal, height, width) for multimodal inputs\n- **Vision encoder** inherited from Qwen3-VL (27-layer ViT, patch size 16, spatial merge 2×2)\n- The models build on the already-merged **Qwen3-Next** architecture (PR #40771), with Qwen3.5 refactoring the projection structure in the DeltaNet module (separate `in_proj_qkv`, `in_proj_z`, `in_proj_\n\nMore detail: https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/93b0a136-fe1c-4077-892b-291bb90026f2",

      "text": "Like many of you, I like to use LLM as tools to help improve my daily life, from editing my emails, to online search.\n\nHowever, I like to use them as an \"inner voice\" to discuss general thoughts and get constructive critic. For instance, when I face life-related problems take might take me hours or days to figure out, a short session with an LLM can significantly quicken that process.\n\nSince the original Llama was leaked, I've been using LLMs locally, but they I always felt they were lacking behind OpenAI or Google models. Thus, I would always go back to using ChatGPT or Gemini when I need serious output. If I needed a long chatting session or help with long documents, I didn't have choice to use the SOTA models, and that means willingly leaking personal or work-related data.\n\nFor me, Gemini-3 is the best model I've ever tried. I don't know about you, but I struggle sometimes to follow chatGPT's logic, but I find it easy to follow Gemini's. It's like that best friend who just gets you and speaks in your language.\n\nWell, that was the case until I tried Qwen3-Coder-Next. For the first time, I could have stimulating and enlightening conversations with a local model. Previously, I used not-so-seriously Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking as local daily driver, but that model always felt a bit inconsistent; sometimes, I get good output, and sometimes I get dumb one.\n\nHowever, Qwen3-Coder-Next is more consistent, and you can feel that it's a pragmatic model trained to be a problem-solver rather than being a sycophant. Unprompted, it will suggest an author, a book, or a theory that already exists that might help. I genuinely feel I am conversing with a fellow thinker rather than a echo chamber constantly paraphrasing my prompts in a more polish way. It's the closest model to Gemini-2.5/3 that I can run locally in terms of quality of experience.\n\n**For non-coders, my point is do not sleep on Qwen3-Coder-Next simply because it's has the \"coder\" tag attached.**\n\nI can't wait for for Qwen-3.5 models. If Qwen3-Coder-Next is an early preview, we are in a real treat.",

The results are just about as bad with temperature 0.\n\nEdit again: PEBKAC. Had DRY multiplier set > 0. Produces only 2x as many errors as GPT-OSS-120B now.",

So on recommendation by a friend i tried Claude opus 4.5 which was the newest model they had. this was Jan of this year and it solved my problem in less than an hour. Since then the 4.6 model has been a massive jump in productivity and even having a pointless conversation with it seems unbelievable. No ego stroking no people pleasing. just logical and tempered responses. the only downside to it is the speed at which you can chew through your allowance of usage. so im pretty keen to see what this model does.  \n\nWhat model are you running and whats your hardware setup like?

It's easy to find edge case where the censorship hit hard. If you are unlucky, the refusal can even be quite aggressive (this is the worse of 7 tries, but every one of them is refusal).  \nCompared to GLM models (at least GLM 4.7 flash), the model shield it's answer in \"I give a neutral text about a sensitive topic\" but manage to give the facts and complete an honest work.  \nI mean no disrespect, and I'm also tired when China is constantly presented as the vilain, Qwen3 Coder Next is the best coding model i could host. But some people are quite sensitive about democratic censorship in academic context, they don't want an AI to influence student toward less democracy. (and to be honest, I understand and respect that view when i serve generalist models on an academic server)",

Its that they exist as open weights at all. A year ago the best open model was maybe 70B and it was nowhere close to frontier. Now we got 700B+ open models competing with the best closed ones.\n\nThe distillation pipeline has gotten insanely good too. Every time a new massive teacher model drops, the 30-70B range gets a noticeable bump within weeks. Ive been using Qwen derivatives for production workloads and the quality jump from distilled models is real.\n\nPlus lets be honest, for 95% of actual use cases a well tuned 30B model handles it just fine. The remaining 5% is where you hit the API for a frontier model anyway.",

If you have a specific kind of task type or a domain you are working that you want to run this model for, try the full model out somewhere online once it hits. Then after you do a couple of quick and dirty projects in it, take your prompts, and use that to generate a set of new prompts in the same domain or of the same task type. \n\nOnce you have your promptset then you load the model with REAP (code is on cerebras github) on a GPU provider if you don't the hardware yourself. Let REAP run through YOUR custom promptset instead of the default (but do compare your promptset to the default to get an idea of a baseline).\n\nThen REAP will prune whatever parameters are less likely to be important to your application for this model and you can begin your quantization. I personally really like all of u/noctrex 's quants and if you look around you can figure out most or all of how to do those.\n\nRemember though, your promptset is how REAP calibrates what to chop off so check that default promptset and make sure your custom one has as much coverage as possible for your use case.

That's 4090 territory — it means hobbyists can now fine-tune MoE models that were previously enterprise-only.\n\n\n\nThe interesting implication: if consumer GPUs can fine-tune MoE architectures, we'll probably see a wave of specialized expert models for niche domains (medical, legal, code) built by small teams who couldn't afford H100 clusters.\n\n\n\nThe VRAM reduction matters way more than the speed improvement for the local community. Training 12x faster on an H100 is nice. Training \\*at all\\* on a 4090 is game-changing.",

      "text": "I've tried lots of \"small\" models < 60 GB in the past. GLM 4.5 Air, GLM 4.7 Flash, GPT OSS 20B and 120B, Magistral, Devstral, Apriel Thinker, previous Qwen coders, Seed OSS, QwQ, DeepCoder, DeepSeekCoder, etc. So what's different with Qwen3 Coder Next in OpenCode or in Roo Code with VSCodium?\n\n* **Speed**: The reasoning models would often yet not always produce rather good results. However, now and then they'd enter reasoning loops despite correct sampling settings, leading to no results at all in a large over-night run. Aside from that the sometimes extensive reasoning takes quite some time for the multiple steps that OpenCode or Roo would induce, slowing down interactive work *a lot*. Q3CN on the other hand is an instruct MoE model, doesn't have internal thinking loops and is relatively quick at generating tokens.\n* **Quality**: Other models occasionally botched the tool calls of the harness. This one seems to work reliably. Also I finally have the impression that this can handle a moderately complex codebase with a custom client & server, different programming languages, protobuf, and some quirks. It provided good answers to extreme multi-hop questions and made reliable full-stack changes. Well, almost. On Roo Code it was sometimes a bit lazy and needed a reminder to really go deep to achieve correct results. Other models often got lost.\n* **Context size**: Coding on larger projects needs context. Most models with standard attention eat all your VRAM for breakfast. With Q3CN having 100k+ context is easy. A few other models also supported that already, yet there were drawbacks in the first two mentioned points.\n\nI run the model this way:  \n`set GGML_CUDA_GRAPH_OPT=1`\n\n`llama-server -m Qwen3-Coder-Next-UD-Q4_K_XL.gguf -ngl 99 -fa on -c 120000 --n-cpu-moe 29 --temp 0 --cache-ram 0`\n\nThis works well with 24 GB VRAM and 64 GB system RAM when there's (almost) nothing else on the GPU. Yields about 180 TPS prompt processing and 30 TPS generation speed for me.\n\n* `temp 0`? Yes, works well for instruct for me, no higher-temp \"creativity\" needed. Prevents the *very occasional* issue that it outputs an unlikely (and incorrect) token when coding.\n* `cache-ram 0`? The cache was supposed to be fast (30 ms), but I saw 3 second query/update times after each request. So I didn't investigate further and disabled it, as it's only one long conversation history in a single slot anyway.\n* `GGML_CUDA_GRAPH_OPT`? Experimental option to get more TPS. Usually works, yet breaks processing with some models.\n\n**OpenCode vs. Roo Code**:\n\nBoth solved things with the model, yet with OpenCode I've seen slightly more correct answers and solutions. But: Roo asks *by default* about every single thing, even harmless things like running a syntax check via command line. This can be configured with an easy permission list to not stop the automated flow that often. OpenCode on the other hand just permits everything by default in code mode. One time it encountered an issue, uninstalled and reinstalled packages in an attempt of solving it, removed files and drove itself into a corner by breaking the dev environment. Too autonomous in trying to \"get things done\", which doesn't work well on bleeding edge stuff that's not in the training set. Permissions can of course also be configured, but the default is \"YOLO\".\n\nAside from that: Despite running with only a locally hosted model, and having disabled update checks and news downloads, OpenCode (Desktop version) tries to contact a whole lot of IPs on start-up.",

Without that, the prompt processing was dominating query time for any agentic coding where the agents were dragging in large amounts of context. Having to offload another layer or two to system RAM didn't seem to hurt the eval performance nearly as much as that helped the processing.\n\nI'm using the IQ4\\_NL quant - tried the MXFP4 too, but IQ4\\_NL seemed slightly better.

That avoids internal reasoning loops and keeps latency predictable, which really matters for agent-style tools and long runs.\n\nTool calling and structured outputs are noticeably more reliable, and the long context (100k+) is actually usable on 24 GB VRAM thanks to its attention/memory characteristics. Combined with deterministic sampling (temp 0), it behaves stably for real-world coding instead of drifting or stalling.",

Than i wrote custom offloading and reach 1 token per second (!!! 255x speedup !!!). On desktop 3070 with full PCE buss it should be 2x faster + 2x fsater because desktop GPU + can be used raid 0 (2 nvme ssd) - 3..5x on loading experts weights + if more vram (12-16Gb) can be more weights cashed on cuda (now i got 55% cache hit rate using only 3gb vram). In total 8-16Gb middle range desktop cards can run it with speed 3 to 10 tokens per second with only 32Gb ram.  If someone interested i can share how i did this. Or should i pattent it? ",

Your SSD isn't reading the remaining 40+ GB once per second, but it also doesn't need to, since it's a MoE.\n\nThere was a posting here a while ago where someone compiled some stats on the predictability of expert selection per token and got things 80%+ correct IIRC. With that approach one can (pre)load the required experts to maximize generation speed without having to wait that much for the comparatively slow SSD. Maybe you did something similar? Or is it just pinning the shared expert(s) and other parts that are needed for each token into (V)RAM?",

It offloads the MoE expert layers to CPU while keeping attention on GPU, so you get decent 20+ tok/s generation without needing a 5090.\n\nWith 96GB DDR5 you should be golden. Try something like:\n\n\\`llama-server.exe -m Qwen3-Coder-Next-UD-Q4\\_K\\_XL.gguf -ngl 99 -fa on -c 80000 --n-cpu-moe 28\\`\n\nStart with fewer CPU-MOE layers and increase until it fits in VRAM.

Exactly with the model, quant and command line stated in my posting, although prompt processing [could be faster](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qz5uww/comment/o48mli1/) as pointed out in another comment.

Docker is usually used to run things that need dependencies, a running database server, whatsoever.\n\nIt'd be like taking your M&Ms out of the pack and wrapping them individually before eating them, just because you're used to unwrap your candy one by one when snacking.",

Tested only to ~50k context, at which point it does ~12t/s. On vanilla llama.cpp I get ~8t/s with a few k context.\n\nOn both machines, the cards are limited to 170W. On the Mi50s only one card is going \"full blast\" at any given moment. On the P40s with ik_llama.cpp, all cards are going at the same time but at ~80W each. Haven't measured power at the wall, but I'd say the P40s with ik consume about 3x the power vs Mi50. Then again, the P40s are about half the price of the Mi50 now.",

You still have to fit the whole 230B in memory somewhere, which consumer GPUs wouldn't be able to do without some heavy quantization or by having multiple active GPUs.\n\nIn conventional MoE, each token gets to use its own 10B of experts, which means that the full 230B is potentially/effectively \"active\" or \"necessary\" for the purposes of any workload. In other words, you can't just have it use a particular 10B to perform a certain task.\n\nBut you still benefit from having just 10B active per token as that's WAY faster than having the whole 230B active per token.\n\nSo even though an individual token only needs a particular 10b, the next token might need some other set of 10b parameters. You can't just put the 10b on your GPU as a result and call it a day.\n\nBut a decent modern GPU can still speed things up here and you can get decent speed, as long as you have the System memory and CPU to things that the GPU cannot fit.",

They include links to API resources prior to weights being released. \n\nI believe that if a post includes a link to API serving hosts then it should be requirement that a hugging face link is also included. If both of these requirements cannot be met for any reason (ex. Weights will probably be released but have not been released yet) the post should be taken down. \n\nThis would at least put some guardrails in place that would make sure posts are closer to the true nature of this sub as opposed to being low-key marketing.",

Purely local stuff - running this model on that hardware, how-to, questions, benchmarks, etc.  Great stuff it's the core of what we are here for.\n\n2.  Non-local models from companies who are doing a lot of local releases as well: posts like this are fine but should tie it back to local.\n\n3.  Genuine breakthroughs (published) that are only being applied to proprietary cloud models today but seem to have a likely relevance for local models a few years from now.  So for example, if there's a news story that a mathematical breakthrough is allowing OpenAI to run inference with 1/10th the hardware as before, well, the potential implications for local in a few years time seems pretty clear.\n\n4.  News about GPUs/memory etc, if made relevant to local can be ok.\n\nThere's probably more but I guess the overall framework is: pure local are the gold standard, and anything else needs to be clearly tied back to local in a real way, even if the model or whatever isn't available to us right now.",

Of course, the intent and the angle should be towards the spirit of local.\n- Its a very continuous spectrum with no hard black/white boundary. GLM5 might be local to some but not to others. Minimax M2.5 announcement comes ahead of weights release - does it mean we remove the announcement posts as its not \"local\" yet despite it might be in a few hours?

Now to be fair there has also been debates about whether this should be discussed since fairly early on too..\n\nBut my feeling at least has always been that while I very much embrace a local and open-weights first mentality, because of course that's why I am here!, I am also here because I like reading and engaging in smart discussions with other people that share these interests, and if a fellow local AI enthusiast is putting some real thought into a post about something related to the AI ecosystem, even if it's an API only model, I personally would like to hear it. Because what happens on the frontier will end up affecting what is local or at a minimum we should stay informed so we can advocate for or work toward innovations that we want to also see happen at the local level. \n\nAnd I simply don't know of another place like this that has the same kind of proportion of smart people who are passionate about this stuff like here, and so if we ban that I feel like we are eliminating some really high quality types of discussions that I have read in the past here and that I don't feel I can find anywhere else easily.\n\nNow if it were a requirement to have to post with a specific category flair that would be easily filterable I would totally support that as well as a compromise on this issue as I get many people are passionate about it and I respect that.\n\nAnd going back to the low effort stuff.. I do totally agree on a lot of what has been said about these kinds of posts. So yes, if it's bots posting what amounts to an ad or somebody simply saying \"ZOMG FUCKING CLAUDE 5 JUST DROPPED!!!!!\" with nothing meaningful to actually add to the discussion? Then yes, nuke this shit please. I am all for that.\n\nBut, I just hope we can strike a balance between any extremes and still be able to have thoughtful discussions among actual local AI hobbyists while definitely getting rid of the stuff we virtually all agree needs to be restricted.\n\nAnyway, thank you for sharing your thoughts on this, and this is definitely a discussion worth having and sorting out as a community.",

I openly use GLM from z.ai because it’s a damned good service. I’m also considering Minimax hosted models because they’re also competitively priced. I also have various GLM models on my M2 Studio Ultra 192GB and M3 Studio Ultra 512GB but seems a bit unnecessary to mention because we’re discussing open weight models after all so the consumption model is a bit irrelevant IMHO. But I’m happy to discuss that for those interested.\n\nI prefer the vendor-hosted models (for now) purely for prefill performance. Decode performance locally is pretty decent. If someone wants to discuss how to squeeze better prefill performance from Apple Silicon outside of KV caching then I’m all ears. Like maybe prompt caching but I can’t find much in the way of proper implementations myself.",
