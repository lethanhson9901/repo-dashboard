It basically just means that a model was trained on something and can regurgitate it. Which can be great and it often shows important differences in training data.

What's far more important is if the model is \"smart\" enough to actually do anything with that training data besides vomit it out.

I've been routing easy tasks to these APIs and keeping Claude for the complex multi-step stuff where it really shines. The cost savings on bulk workloads add up fast.\nThe real shift isn't \"open source = Claude killer\" - it's that you now have legit options for hybrid setups. Use cheap APIs for 80% of tasks, premium for the 20% that actually needs it.\nWrote up a detailed comparison here if anyone wants the full breakdown on pricing/benchmarks - https://onllm.dev/blog/2-mimo-v2-flash-kimi-k25-democratizing",

Then I added specific tools to help me with my writing- uploaded all of my books into it so I could ask thr chatbot questions  about events and characters. Have it evaluate full manuscripts with specific editong questions -.review this characters arc and look for plotholes. \n\nThen I refined the memory storage, moved from Langchain to Langraph, and used a three tier summary system to summarise the books. Then I created an engineer persona and did the same with the systems source code and made it auto documenting. Then I hooked it into.an ad platform and three sales platforms ao that I could see how various ad campaigns worked and advise me on whether an ad was working and whether to scale it, stop it or just leave for another week. Then I added a visual cortex so it could generate and edit images. Then I automated the royalty system.\n\nThis has taken me two months to create and yet i'm not a developer  -.i'm a software tester.

Some guys found the paper Google wrote, decided they could build a business on it, and created OpenAI. Their product had an uncanny ability to generate text that passed the Turing test and started selling it. A bunch of other people realized it had a lot more potential and developed the tech as well. Once companies started jumping on the bandwagon, the sales guys stepped in and said, \"hold my beer\" and sold more than they had ever sold before. They got trillions of dollars in investment into various AI businesses and had CEOs around the planet scared to death that their company would miss out if they didn't jump onboard. Every CEO starts prostletizing the new meta and starts delivering their products and... No one really wants them. They're  kinda cool I guess, if you want to have a conversation with something that's not really intelligent. But the real value that they sold from the beginning, the only way most of these projects can even break even, much less turn a profit, is if they somehow increase profits, which they have not done, so far. Best bet so far is people willing to pay $20 a month to use a chatbot like a search engine. The one dim light at the end of the tunnel, and the only thing that will save all these investors' money is if someone comes out with an agent that can replace a human employee. Alas, there's really not much hope for that as we have started hitting walls in performance that throwing more compute cannot solve. People are starting to notice that the latest models are scoring better and better on all the benchmarks, but they really aren't any smarter, they are just getting better at taking the tests. In my honest opinion, Qwen2.5 was smarter than Qwen3. Maybe it's just the quants that my machine can run, but 3 can't answer questions as well. It can't digest internet results and summarize as well. Its logic is weaker. My theory is that Qwen 3 has more guardrails, it's safer. But that makes it dumber. I think that's the roadblock that the companies are coming up against. Since Chat-GPT talked that guy into killing himself, companies are not comfortable releasing a product that doesn't have strict safeties but those same safeties also make LLMs dumber. So companies are throwing everything they have at solving this while training for benchmarks and hoping there's some breakthrough that can get them over the last 30% of improvement they need to unveil the ultimate product. The game changer. \n\n**THE DIGITAL EMPLOYEE**\n\nIf they don't do it soon, all the seed money will run out, the investors will demand their profits, and there won't be any. They are all treading water right now, hoping for a miracle, and the sales guys are out there promising everything and delivering nothing. \n\nI can't wait to see what happens.",

What’s great about these investigations is that they’re a huge source of question-answer pairs.\n\nThe second project is being carried out by a friend of mine who is a sports bettor. His idea revolves around assessing the body language of soccer referees in the local league, or certain elements related to them during a match – like their wording or decisions – to find signals of corruption. I don’t know if the idea is viable, but every few years a referee from that league gets convicted, so there might be something to it…\n\nI think there are currently many innovative projects, but everyone keeps them to themselves, looking for profit.",

Ford is most famous for saying \"if I asked people what they wanted, they would have said a faster horse\" when he invented the model T. \n\n\nPeople also can't build things that are cool and don't immediately have a sales pitch. In this near-buesting bubble, to make anything is expensive and you need to have an ROI because nobody wants another OpenAI-sized mouth to feed with endless cash. ",

Most LLM benchmarks focus on steady-state throughput or tokens per second once the model is already hot but not on swap, reload, or reactivation latency. In practice, people tend to measure this with a simple harness that repeatedly evicts a model from VRAM and then triggers a cold or semi-cold inference and records time to first token along with GPU memory residency over time. If you want meaningful comparisons, you have to control for disk, PCIe, and host memory effects, since reactivation latency often ends up being more user-visible than raw throughput when you’re switching between models.",

Every month the API cost floor drops another 50%.\n\nMeanwhile running a 70B locally still means either a k+ GPU or dealing with quantization tradeoffs and 15 tok/s on consumer hardware.\n\nI've been running local for about a year now and I'm genuinely starting to question the math. The three arguments I keep hearing:\n\n1. **Privacy** — legit, no argument. If you're processing sensitive data, local is the only option.\n2. **No rate limits** — fair, but most providers have pretty generous limits now unless you're doing something unusual.\n3. **\"It's free after hardware costs\"** — this one aged poorly. That 3090 isn't free, electricity isn't free, and your time configuring and optimizing isn't free. At current API rates you'd need to run millions of tokens before breaking even.\n\nThe argument I never hear but actually find compelling: **latency control and customization**. If you need a fine-tuned model for a specific domain with predictable latency, local still wins. But that's a pretty niche use case.\n\nWhat's keeping you all running local at this point?

Also, they can't kill local AI by pushing the frontier (open weights AI is trailing frontier models by 6-8 months). They have no moat in the model itself, and all the money they pour on training will only help Chinese clones when they distill it.\n\nSo what they are currently doing is to buy up enough wafers to jack up prices for machines used in local AI. I think that's what they are more worried about, consumer GPUs that crosses the 32GB-ish VRAM barrier. They play at TSMC made GPUs more expensive and made people buy more 8GB GPUs.\n\nI think that by the time the enshittification of closed AI is completed, running local AI will be unfeasible, a distant thing in the past",

Just look at the cloud infrastructure market for reference. There are many competitive options even beyond the big 3 especially if you're not doing hyperscale enterprise b2b shit",

API pricing might get better over time, but agents are using more and more tokens (agents are not just coding agents, there’s stuff you can outsource to your machine). I question the whole “its getting cheaper” argument (the goal post in most people’s heads is moving all the time, for many scenarios GPT-OSS is enough; is test time compute free?, etc.). The whole subscription model is there bc api prices would be ridiculous for agentic use. \n2. By buying hw, you buy a capability that can be used for many things. Also, in the LLM space that capability gets better and better (new LLMs might outgrow your hw though), just like the API models. \n3. Learning; this is far more valuable than a couple months of savings. \n4. I better like to own than rent. The fact that it is available in my house makes it easier for me to run experiments (building agents). \n5. I can afford it (I don’t spend $ on useless shit usually), why not (see the other points)? \n6. Every GPU I bought (high end nvidia consumer cards), I sold it for more. I don’t expect this to change until GPUs get replaced in inference. \n…\n\nDon’t try to win $ on it, that’s hard in this environment imo.",

It's \"free\" as in I would've used the same amount of electricity for either inference or gaming.\n\nAs for other points:\n\n* **Availability**: I know my local hosted model won't be \"sunsetted\" or that I might lose access (internet outage, geopolitical reasons).\n* **Control**: I get to pick the quants and parameters and can accept risk with those. You don't always know from external APIs what quants and sampler settings they run, if they serve lower quants during high load, etc.\n* **Censorship**: Some providers run an additional filter which might block responses that aren't blocked when running local.\n* **Latency**: When I talk to the LLM and want to hear it's response ( Speech>Text (Whisper) -> Text>Text (Qwen3) -> Text>Speech (Qwen3-TTS) ), then using an API would be too slow to not be jarring. The low latency of local beats API every time.\n\nAnd most important of all, it's just fun!",

          "text": "If your goal is getting the most tokens out of your money, you are right. APIs like deepseek with cache feature etc beats local ai by wide margin. It takes years for a 3090 or a mac to pay for itself when you calculate the ROI based on how much token you'd generate with your local hardware.\n\nYou said privacy and you are right, when you use api, you should assume that someone is going to read that conversation and/or put it into a training dataset to train or sell it. But you are missing something else: Control. \n\nWhen you use api, you don't know what is happening in background. Your inputs probably will get injected with API providers safety policies and rules before it reaches the AI. So even if the model itself isn't censored, API providers will take their own measurements to comply with regulations and concerns around AI. Not every API provider does this right now, but you can bet your ass on it that every one of them will be forced to do this in a very near future.\n\nSince 2023 we lived the wild west period of AI. And now corpos and governments are taking things under control. I'd say enjoy the dirt cheap apis and loose censorship while it lasts. But don't assume this will be how things will be in future.\n\nLike others pointed out right now there is a \"gold rush\" in AI field that is slowly dying out. As the investments dry out, the shareholders and investors will stop being patient and demand to see real profits. AI startups and datacenters that made huge investments will have to boost up their prices like crazy to be able to pay their debts. AI is an exciting technology and I think it'll be in center of our life from now on but the entry level is high and it requires a lot of investments to get it rolling. Training a model takes hundreds of millions of $, a solid data engineers and datasets. Running things at large scale is also very expensive. Current LLMs are extremely inefficient. It'll take a long time to smooth things out. Companies that don't rely their entire income on Api and investments such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Alibaba, Meta will survive, while most AI startups will disappear.\n\nOwning an AI capable PC lets you stop worrying about whether API prices will raise or if there'll be new ai regulations or privacy policies or if your favorite api provider or service will disappear next month or not. Owning an AI capable PC is like saving your game at that point. Worst thing that can happen is you don't get a new updated model for a long time but you can run what you can until your hardware lasts.",

Use cheap APIs for 80% of tasks, premium for the 20% that actually needs it.\nWrote up a detailed comparison here if anyone wants the full breakdown on pricing/benchmarks - https://onllm.dev/blog/2-mimo-v2-flash-kimi-k25-democratizing",

API Pricing/Chat subscriptions are subsidized, not only for us the customers but also the companies (Claude has quite a bit of 'free' compute from AWS and I'm sure it translates over to the other large providers). While they are profitable somewhat on paper, once that allocation runs out, you will see an increase in price.\n\n2. Business processes will feel the brunt of that, and like how some companies migrate to local DBs/own server stack, AI falls under the same category\n\nNow granted, running local is not as lucrative and at this point is becoming much more of a luxury with the increase of hardware costs, and more importantly, power costs (especially planned price hikes). The control is still appealing and will continue to grow, although probably with not the same hardware requirements as we have now.

          "text": "There are two differences I see: Some people use locally hosted models for personal use, and some people need to bootstrap ML to a product.\n\nIn terms of product:  \n  \n1. First of all, all the models available over the API have extremely high safety railguards. This affects some of my experiments (which can be product tests), which even though I am not generating NSFW content with it, I have found the censored models performing far worse in some of the specific personalization tasks I test with (they strangely tend to be less creative? I don't have any formal benchmarks for this so doubt it).  \n  \n2. Self-hosting is also much more \"safe\" in a sense that there is floor of what you can lose. If you build a public facing demo application of a product and didn't bother to secure it yet since it is an early stage PoC, you won't  run into strange issues with insecure rate spamming (exploding API costs) and whatnot. Yes, this is terrible practice but sometimes I just want to share my application with peers and its a lot easier to throw a Streamlit site over LAN and worry not about security (at worst, the app just crashes).\n\n3. I do mostly use the Gemini API, but the rate limits are certainly an issue with the free tier. The better alternative is just to use the paid tier if you have the money, to which you can get a surprising amount of research/experimental work done with just $10 worth of credit.\n\n4. Technically speaking, it is \"free\" for me. I just use my group's server (p beefy hardware) to locally host when I need so I'm not actually paying anything for the hardware. If the place you work at (or your PC) just happens to have compute for training/HPC work, you might as well use it since its already there.\n\n5. Millions of tokens is not as hard to hit as you think. Especially if you work with image data to VLM, which can easily cost thousands of tokens. I work with massive amounts of data in many media formats, data processing with LLM API is very expensive so the breaking-in-even is not a very compelling argument (this is still ran through the API, however, expect big bills far greater than GPUs). \n\nI think the nicer thing about the API is just sheerly how easy it is to setup. Buying hardware takes so much time when I can just rent it out on the cloud OR just use some money and use the API (download API key => download package => Use AI).\n\nThe more interesting argument has always been local GPU vs cloud GPU I think. APIs are just so limited to their scope and what they can do, but they are so convenient that there isn't a good reason to not use them if you have funding/VC money (with exception if you need something that's more specific than a generic language model, which is not many applications).",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nThe Qwen team just dropped **Qwen3-TTS**, and it’s a significant step forward for local speech synthesis. If you’ve been looking for a high-quality, open-source alternative to ElevenLabs or OpenAI’s TTS that you can actually run on your own hardware, this is it.\n\nWe’ve put together a repository that provides an **OpenAI-compatible FastAPI server**, meaning you can use it as a drop-in replacement for any app already using OpenAI’s TTS endpoints. Streaming support out of the box, plug and play with Open-Webui.\n\n# Why this is a big deal:\n\n* **Insane Speed:** It features a dual-track hybrid architecture that hits \\~97ms end-to-end latency for streaming. It starts talking almost the instant you send the text.\n* **Natural Voice Control:** You don't just send text; you can give it natural language instructions like *\"Say this in an incredibly angry tone\"* or *\"A shaky, nervous 17-year-old voice\"* and it actually follows through.\n* **Easy Voice Cloning:** Give it a 3-second reference clip, and it can clone the timbre and emotion remarkably well.\n* **OpenAI Drop-in:** Works natively with the OpenAI Python client. Just change your `base_url` to localhost.\n* **Multilingual:** Supports 10+ languages (ZH, EN, JP, KR, DE, FR, RU, PT, ES, IT).\n\n# Getting Started (The Quick Way)\n\nIf you have Docker and a GPU, you can get this running in seconds:\n\nBash\n\n    git clone https://github.com/groxaxo/Qwen3-TTS-Openai-Fastapi\n    docker build -t qwen3-tts-api .\n    docker run --gpus all -p 8880:8880 qwen3-tts-api\n\n# Python Usage (OpenAI Style)\n\nPython\n\n    from openai import OpenAI\n    \n    client = OpenAI(base_url=\"http://localhost:8880/v1\", api_key=\"not-needed\")\n    \n    response = client.audio.speech.create(\n        model=\"qwen3-tts\",\n        voice=\"Vivian\",  # 9 premium voices included\n        input=\"This sounds way too human for a local model.\",\n        speed=1.0\n    )\n    response.stream_to_file(\"output.mp3\")\n\n# Technical Highlights\n\n* **Architecture:** It uses the new **Qwen3-TTS-Tokenizer-12Hz** for acoustic compression. It skips the traditional \"LM + DiT\" bottleneck, which is why the latency is so low.\n* **Model Sizes:** Available in **0.6B** (super fast/light) and **1.7B** (high fidelity) versions.\n* **VRAM Friendly:** Supports FlashAttention 2 to keep memory usage down.\n\n**Links to dive deeper:**\n\n* [🤗 Hugging Face Collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qwen3-tts)\n* [📄 Research Paper on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15621)\n* [💻 Github Repo](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS)\n\nI’m really curious to see how the community integrates this into local LLM agents. The 97ms latency makes real-time voice conversation feel actually... real.\n\nLet me know if you run into any issues setting it up!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sa9itpxw6dfg1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fe58c44a2d0b9d03a5bf099024f18752d48949d",

Kokoro and Piper don't have voice cloning support. Which is kinda nice to have usually for a TTS. Kyutai did also release a pretty small model around 100M params with voice cloning (pocket-tts) as well which is probably gonna be faster than Qwen3 TTS (0.6B and 1.7B params).",

SSE option too for sentence-by-sentence. Vibe coded with Claude Code, certainly not perfect but works for my use case until true streaming gets exposed for us... hopefully.\n\nBut none of this fixes the real problem: the model needs all the text upfront before it starts generating. You can stream the audio out, but you can't feed it text incrementally as your LLM produces it. That's baked into the transformer architecture, not something a server wrapper can solve.",

The reviewer sees the full context of decisions made. It's not magic - it's just passing data around intelligently - but it feels like they're actually collaborating.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The not-so-cool part\\*\\*: Debugging 7 agents talking to each other is... an experience. Sometimes they work beautifully. Sometimes one agent keeps assigning tasks to itself in an infinite loop. You know, typical multi-agent stuff.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Stack\\*\\*: TypeScript, better-sqlite3, MCP SDK, Zod\n\n\n\nNot enterprise-ready. Not trying to compete with anything. Just an experiment to learn how agent coordination patterns work.\n\n\n\nMIT licensed: [github.com/blackms/aistack](http://github.com/blackms/aistack)\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions or hear how you're approaching multi-agent systems.\n\n",

              "text": "    Great questions - these are exactly the things I've been wrestling with.\n    \n    On memory contamination / identity boundaries: my current approach is pretty simple, honestly. Namespaces + prompt-level isolation. Each agent has a strong system prompt defining its role and capabilities, and they access shared memory via namespace filtering. The key insight is that agents don't actually \"retain\" personality across calls - they're stateless. What persists is the memory content, not the agent's perspective on it.\n    \n    So when the coder stores something like memory_store(\"auth-decision\", \"Using JWT with refresh tokens\", {namespace: \"architecture\"}), the reviewer later queries this and interprets it through its own system prompt lens. There's no embedding space separation - it's the same FTS5 index. The \"identity boundary\" is entirely at the prompt level.\n    \n    Is this ideal? Probably not. But it sidesteps the contamination problem because agents don't actually share state - they share facts. The interpretation happens fresh each time.\n    \n    On memory prioritization: hybrid approach. FTS5 with BM25 ranking for keyword relevance, optional vector search (OpenAI/Ollama embeddings) for semantic similarity, then merge with deduplication where vector results come first (higher quality), then FTS backfill. The \"prioritization\" is really just semantic match > keyword match > recency as tiebreaker.\n    \n    For large contexts I'm honestly just relying on the LLM's attention mechanism. I send relevant search results, not the entire memory. If context gets too big, that's a sign the search query wasn't specific enough.\n    \n    What I'd do differently if this were production: per-agent memory scopes (private + shared pools), decay functions for old memories, explicit \"handoff\" objects when one agent passes to another. But for an experiment, the current approach works well enough to see the patterns emerge. The agents do coordinate surprisingly well when you give them structured ways to leave breadcrumbs for each other.\n    \n    What approaches are you exploring for the contamination problem?",

A basic anti-loop system catches the obvious stuff — \"agent A spawned task B which spawned task C which looks suspiciously like A again.\" But the more interesting patterns are subtler:\n\n1. **Semantic drift detection** — task descriptions mutate slightly each iteration until they're technically different but functionally identical. You'd want embedding similarity checks against the task's ancestors, not just string matching.\n\n2. **Resource exhaustion triggers** — if an agent has touched >N files or made >M API calls without producing a deliverable, something's probably wrong. Hard to tune but catches the \"productively going nowhere\" loops.\n\n3. **Consensus checkpoints** — for high-stakes tasks, require a different agent to sign off before the originating agent's subtasks can spawn their own children. Adds latency but breaks the self-reinforcing cycles.\n\nThe lineage tracking is the foundation though. Without knowing *where* a task came from, you can't catch any of these patterns.

I am not advocating for AI slop and I super respect the software engineering field so if you're trying to do everything by hand, that's cool, but if you've never heard of Cursor, I highly recommend you check it out. I used to write one full stack application every 1 to 2 weeks now I do like 5 to 6 a day. I'm no different from someone who doesn't know how to code with the exception that I understand the underlying stack of technologies. Especially how things should fit together, which is the only advantage I have over someone who vibe-codes.",

Of course, it's not going to be an Opus, but considering its size, its way of thinking, its capabilities, and good use of tools, etc., its improving speed, and a more up-to-date model, I can only congratulate Z for the great work.\n\nIf it continues to improve, especially the stability and performance drop at high CTX, it will be a very good model. I'm going to stick with it because I'm liking it.\n\nI haven't tried this update yet, let's see if it improves my results. I'm currently dropping to 850/75 over 35/40k(128)",

Yesterday I was using it with about 45,000 context and maxing out the 4090.\n\nNow it fits with 90,000 context.\n\nI like the model. Still a bit quirky though. I had it running some agentic stuff yesterday and I was really impressed with what I was able to scaffold out of it, but I absolutely had to hold its hand a bit. Reminds me of trying to code with gemini flash or something - it's not terrible and you can get the job done. Beyond coding, it crushes tool use and works great as a tool using assistant. You can get it to do some writing and roleplay but it doesn't seem particularly good at that (it'll make mistakes bigger/more creative writing focused models don't). It's definitely my new default for my home-server.",

It calls search, then fetches the URL, then based on that another search, based on all the above git clones a repo, edits it, runs tests and so on for hours without any issues. All simple tasks, of course.\n\nWhen given a huge codebase, it will still use tons of tools but will come up with wrong conclusions or have obviously wrong priorities.\n\nI used the API so far, so don't know if this holds up on local setups with quants, but I sure hope so.\n\nBtw, the model behind API is having huge issues atm as well.

It’s pretty damn impressive.\n\nI plan on getting vllm up and running with it once they’ve got it all dialed in there. It’s small enough that we should be able to run multiple simultaneous agents - possibly dozens of them. I’m kinda excited to see what a pile of local agents set to work could do with such reliable tool calling.",
