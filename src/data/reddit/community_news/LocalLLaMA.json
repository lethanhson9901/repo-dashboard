I had leaked a key to my public gateway server that i use for private dev, stupid yes, but months later I noticed a random chinese message in logs, which clearly wasn’t from me, and upon closer examination i found a sneaky trickle of bizarre logs going back a couple of months. \n\nStupid to leak keys, the system was hard capped at $5 though so ultimately no real issue. But over ~2 months of being breached, they had accumulated less than $2 of requests. \n\nVery bizarre intriguing messages. Many languages, all very short prompts, single pair conversation, things that humans would not be asking. In a veryyyyy slow trickle. I might be able to find a copy of these logs but i did nuke the system upon finding this.\n\nAnyways my only thought was that my key made it into some coordinated distillation system. Literally the only explanation I can think of. Not much other stuff on the internet. And if i wasn’t literally the only approved user of this public gateway, there’s no way I would’ve noticed (yes i have learned). That is to say, many people are breached on inference services and have no clue, because this is coordinated and strategic, rather than simple opportunism. I know better now, but had assumed that a leaked LLM key would be bled dry with an agent or something. \n\nThis whole thing occurred several months ago, maybe more than a year.",

But the satirism, even if not overwhelming, stil quite strong, is absolutely not what Claude would expect.\n2.\t⁠Once again, those much cheaper models are not here to fight with Claude for market share, they attack Claude's bottom line, will force Claude to lower price, and lose the 'premium' tax, this is about survival.\n3.\t⁠Claude would be happy to be \"distilled\" (lots of $$$ for api; literally counting cash; we all know how expensive its api is) if the distillation was harmless. But it appears Claude is a bit desperate and the only explanation is the distillation really means something serious.",

First of all they clearly didn’t immediately try to bleed my key dry. There was a slow trickle of small and very broad prompt/responses covering seemingly bizarre random things in random languages.\n\nI’m better about secrets now (even when they have hard limits ), but a bit surprised i even caught this. Actually now i remember more- I left my litellm gateway master key exposed, i don’t think i exposed openrouter. So not only did they strategically trickle requests, but they literally went through my exposed litellm key, probed my gateway server to see what it supported, and then made these requests THROUGH my litellm, further blending in. I don’t think i leaked the actual managed service 3rd party keys. But i was pretty impressed ngl. I noticed random chinese in my litellm logging and found this. The keys only even had $5 on it, and these attackers hardly even used $2 over the couple of months they had access. So they must have INSANE leaked key sets.\n\nThis really piqued my curiosity but i had nothing to go off of to look deeper.",

They remember past decades during which China was notorious for copying or outright stealing from western companies and assume nothing has changed. The problem is that China has arguably moved past that while their opinons haven't. You could absolutely say it's racism (I would).\n\nI say this an American who has been blown away in the past few years by the engineering and developments I see coming out of China. And I don't mean promises, I mean they actually went and built it, then mass produced it. I looked up a map of railways in the world, and China's high speed rail network eclipses everyone else. My soldering gear, oscilloscope, and so forth are all Chinese designed and made, with shockingly solid quality and design.\nThis reminds me of the 1970s and early 80s, where Americans had to come to terms with the fact that made in Japan no longer meant junk. By the latter half of the 80s, average Americans were outright fearful Japan was going to take over. I wouldn't be surprised if history is going to repeat itself, especially given instability in the US.",

First of all, I don't even believe their accusations, even after reading their “report,” but I won’t get into that here. Let’s assume their claims are real and take their accusations at face value. Are they really going to complain about it? Really? After they’ve scraped the entire internet, DDoSed multiple small blogs, and harassed the open-source community for using their model in a way that was initially authorized in their TOS?\n\nDario “Asmodeus” (yeah, childish, but I’m calling him that) likes to position himself as the last bastion of humanity—the final barrier holding back the AI-pocalypse. He leverages every tool in his arsenal: pandering to the internet with virtue signaling, accusing competitors every other day of doing something shady, claiming that the only reason they don’t release open models is the potential for misuse, and the list goes on.\n\nI don’t like Sam Altman. Actually, let me rephrase that: I don’t like U.S. Big Tech, because they seem driven solely by unchecked greed, encouraged by an unchecked system funded by ordinary people. However, I think that even among those people, Dario really stands out as being particularly bad.\n\nI worry about the future of Bun now that it’s owned by Anthropic. I give it a few more years before they find a way to ruin it. I’m tired of this unchecked corporate greed and can’t wait for these companies to collapse so we can look back and think, “Those were some crazy times.” I mean, if that doesn’t happen, Judge Dredd will stop being satire and start looking like a documentary.",

This is evident by GPT5.2 which is one of the worst frontier models of this generation that does not have EQ at all while not that good at research (except xhigh).\n\nMeta and currently Xai are the proofs that compute alone can't help the model anymore.

Freshly compiled Llama.cpp and those are my settings after some tweaking, still not fully tuned: \n\n./llama.cpp/llama-server \\\\\n\n\\-m /models/**Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-MXFP4\\_MOE.gguf** \\\\\n\n\\-a \"DrQwen\" \\\\\n\n\\-c 131072 \\\\\n\n\\-ngl all \\\\\n\n\\-ctk q8\\_0 \\\\\n\n\\-ctv q8\\_0 \\\\\n\n\\-sm none \\\\\n\n\\-mg 0 \\\\\n\n\\-np 1 \\\\\n\n\\-fa on\n\nAround 22 gigs of vram used.\n\n  \nNow the fun part:\n\n1. I'm getting over 100t/s on it\n\n2. This is the first open weights model I was able to utilise on my home hardware to successfully complete my own \"coding test\" I used for years for recruitment (mid lvl mobile dev, around 5h to complete \"pre AI\" ;)). It did it in around 10 minutes, strong pass. First agentic tool that I was able to \"crack\" it with was [Kodu.AI](http://Kodu.AI) with some early sonnet roughly 14 months ago.\n\n3. For fun I wanted to recreate this dashboard OpenAI used during Cursor demo last summer, I did a recreation of it with Claude Code back then and posted it on Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1mk7plb/just\\_recreated\\_that\\_gpt5\\_cursor\\_demo\\_in\\_claude/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1mk7plb/just_recreated_that_gpt5_cursor_demo_in_claude/) So... Qwen3.5 was able to do it in around 5 minutes. \n\n**I think we got something special here...**\n\n  \n",

Big gap vs your 100+ - MXFP4 plus llama.cpp on GDDR6X memory bandwidth will murder LM Studio on unified memory for this. Something for Mac users to know going in.\n\nOn the agentic side, the observation that's actually mattered for me: tool schema size is a real tax on local models. Swapped frameworks recently - went from 11 tools in the system prompt to 5. Same model, same hardware, same Mac Studio. Response time went from \\~5 min to \\~1 min. The 3090 will feel this less but it's not zero. If you're building agentic pipelines on local hardware, keep your tool count lean.\n\nOne other thing: thinking tokens add up fast in agentic loops. Every call I tested opened with a <think> block before generating useful output. At 14 t/s that overhead is noticeable. Probably less of an issue at 100 t/s but worth tracking.\n\nAgreed this model is something special at the weight class. First time I've run a local model in production for extended agentic tasks without reaching for an API as a fallback.\n\n",

I would think, them both being MOE, that similar settings would work for them.",

I miss the feeling of reading my first couple schizo-posts. It was something physics-inspired I think. I even shared one with a colleague who was a physics postdoc before moving into ML",

It's been a little bit of a journey, here's what I found out:\n\n- The memory bandwidth is a big bottleneck. I usually don't see the GPU go past ~50W with large models, while it's able to push ~80W+ with smaller ones.\n- It's not as well supported as it could have been (classic NVIDIA move). Apparently the \"blackwell\" cores are a bit weak compared to most other ones in the series.\n- The spark is best suited for MoE/sparse models, where the benefit of the large memory outweighs the relatively weak compute power\n- The best model I've found so far, that just baaarely fits in 128GB of shared memory, is Step-3.5-Flash, 4bit quantized. When running with `llama-server`, it takes approx 113GB memory... but it runs, at ~18t/s, with pp at ~360t/s.\n- OpenClaw's context handling is awful. It puts a \"message ID\" early in the context, which changes for each message, causing the KV cache in llama-server to be invalidated after each message... causing responses to take ~40s each. Luckily there's workarounds like https://github.com/mallard1983/openclaw-kvcache-proxy\n\nSo basically, if you don't give it too much access or ask for too much, it's actually pretty decent. Not quite at the level of hosted models, but it's usable for some easier tasks.",

Had an agent delete files it had no business touching and I couldn't stop it either; same frantic energy as this post suggests.\n\nThe root problem: \"confirm before acting\" is a prompt. The agent reads it, agrees with it, and then does whatever it decides anyway because there's nothing enforcing it at the code level. You're negotiating with the LLM, not restricting it.\n\nAgentWard sits as a proxy between OpenClaw and its skills. Every tool call gets evaluated against a YAML policy before it executes: block, allow, or require real approval. Outside the context window entirely, so the agent can't talk its way past it.\n\nhttps://agentward.ai \nopen source, works with OpenClaw today.",

Stuff like \"better\\_thing = better\\_process(old\\_thing); ... return old\\_thing;\", or leaving out \"retain\\_graph=True\" on the last backward pass in a logging block that would have zero'd the gradients for the actual update right afterwards.\n\nStill I'd be kind of impressed if that actually was intentional and not just coincidence and bad luck. On the paranoid side again, Claude usually apologizes when making a mistake, but\n\n\\`\\`\\`  \nMe: Damn, you almost let me walk into a trap. <code> That isn't correct at all, we're not even changing `loss` like this.\n\nClaude: Ha, yes — `l_hard` is computed and then completely ignored.

I'm not one to scream about corporate conspiracies or whatever. But everyone can agree that foundation model companies have profited massively from the web's ecosystem of shared knowledge, created by the efforts of hundreds of millions of humans.\n\nOpenAI, Google, and every other major lab at least have the most basic decency to share research findings even if nothing else. How can any decent person profit this massively on the backs of others' work and not even make a small effort to contribute some knowledge back?",

They might be trying to use logic training data to establish a rule based system on their models\n\n\nAlso pretty much all benchmarks are at least tangentially related to programming and logic and they focused on it and train for it. ",

Ask any competent model anything, you’re getting 200+words of hedging against all possible adjacents lol.\n\nClaude has a way of answering the question you ask at a length that makes sense. \n\nIt’s pretty safe to say that if you’re using AI for ‘something’, you’re likely not too well versed at ‘something’ or might not even be able to name it. If a model doesn’t catch the meaning, each follow up poisons the well further. \n\nOn top of ‘getting it’. The recent Claude models are really good at pausing and asking/helping you to clarify before continuing. \n\nAs for your later question you’re gonna have to read the room on that one pal 😃",

PewDiePie might not be actually doing the things he's claiming to on camera, but he's provided far more evidence than many other streamer/gamer/sysadmin types. For what it's worth, I do think SomeOrdinaryGamers actually has done some codec-coding in the past, but he's clearly spent more time focusing on Youtube than his tech chops over the years.\n\nI recommend watching [Primeagen's video about \"The PewDiePie Problem\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu2FQ2hW4_o) where he covers some of the drama about PewDiePie's tech journey. Some people get really defensive when they see someone being successful in the objectives they set out to do and lash out with disbelief when they see such results when they personally don't see such results in their own objectives. Instead of being jealous about someone else's success, be supportive in it and use it as motivation to get productive and focus more on specific tasks you want to get better at yourself.\n\nPewDiePie has unbelievable amounts of monetary resources (money) and tons of time to do laser-focused work. I'm actually quite encouraged by his journey, not disappointed.",

Terms of Use and bot blocking aren't letting us get that directly, but uhm, if people want to help out and run a couple thousand each on your own api keys, and use this app to do it and send us the results, we won't object.\"",

As a result we use open models in closed environments.\n\nThe problem is that my customers don’t want Chinese models. “National security risk”.\n\nBut the only recent semi-capable model we have from the US is gpt-oss-120b, which is far behind modern LLMs like GLM, MiniMax, etc.\n\nSo we are in a bind: use an older, less capable model and slowly fall further and further behind the curve, or… what?\n\nI suspect this is why Hegseth is pressuring Anthropic: the DoD needs offline AI for awful purposes and wants Anthropic to give it to them.\n\nBut what do we do? Tell the customers we’re switching to Chinese models because the American models are locked away behind paywalls, logging, and training data repositories? Lobby for OpenAI to do us another favor and release another open weights model? We certainly cannot just secretly use  Chinese models, but the American ones are soon going to be irrelevant. We’re in a bind.\n\n~~Our one glimmer of hope is StepFun-AI out of South Korea.

                  "text": "What kind of holy hallucination is this?  \nDid you get this from AI?\n\nThis is NOT how this works, literally at all!\n\n1. You do not get updates from models, if you downloaded DeepSeek V2, you don't upgrade to DeepSeek V3.2, those are two different models, one does not impact the other, and you don't ever \"update a model\".\n\n2. It is clear you know nothing about fine tuning, RAG, etc., so let me clarify something using an example I literally just did. I wanted to create a custom fine tune of Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct, some custom LoRAs, and a RAG database. RAG is different than training data, though you can set your database up in such a way that you can use the same data for RAG, Fine Tunes, (Q)(Re)LoRAs, etc, these are different tasks altogether. Let's look at the fine tuning though.\n\n3. So before fine tuning a model, you are going to take your data and convert it into pairs, the easiest way to do this now is using an LLM, (or several for refinement). You convert it into basically what boils down to prompts and responses, building relevance among a dataset so you know what the raw data even does. When you do a retune of the model, you are basically restructuring the weights and balances of the model to fit this new data in the model and place it within the values and rankings of that model. The MOMENT you switch to a new model, you have to do it all over again, so for example, my 400MB code dataset, my API LoRA, my change log and update LoRA that I made for Qwen3-Coder-30B-Instruct, if I want to use it with a Qwen 3.5 model, I have to re-train the whole thing over again. So when an AI company is improving data, they have a massive dataset that they've built, but they also comb through that dataset, mess with how they weigh certain data, scrub known bad data, add in new synthetic data, use HITM to filter and refine the data, etc., and then they re-train the next generation model on the improved data, which blended with improvements to the model itself, should make the new model smarter (not a guarantee). When you fine tune a model, it's no different than training a new model, you start over every time, but if you have a clue what you are doing, you have an evolving database to be doing this with, hopefully separated and organized.\n\n4. RAG databased are not dependent on a model, they are model agnostic, a RAG database is NOT part of the model like a fine tune, it's a dataset where you're likely to maintain your dynamic or evolving data, this is a much more refined external data source that your model uses to generate responses from, where you need retrieval to be consistent, updated, and live. For example: Say you have a customer database, you have accounts, balances, billables, etc. all attached to that account database. You're not fine tuning your model on customer's individual data (that would be dumb), but you're also not updating your fine tuning (which is very time consuming/compute intensive) daily, so you take your fine tuned model and you connect it to your RAG database and now your model is pulling live data and your AI agent can look at account balances, equipment, etc., without needing to hallucinate them. There's tons of other uses for RAG, like live code bases, combined data sources, etc., but the point is that isn't even part of the model at all.  \n  \nI can use my database with any model I choose, I can change it at any time, I am locked into nothing. I can use my data to build for Qwen 3.5 now if I want or I can decide I want to use it with GLM 4.7 Flash, the changes involved in doing one over the other are fairly arbitrary.\n\nWhile I'm doing this, while I'm looking at weights, balances, etc., I can filter any geopolitical BS I want. I could go to a Chinese model and with one python script I could re-write all of that data to replace Xi Ping with myself if I wanted to or delete him from existence. If you have any idea what you are doing, you can and should be aware of any potential issues with the model you are working with and really, you can address that stuff during fine tuning. What you don't get with fine tuning, LoRAs and the RAG database will eliminate anyway.\n\nFor the most part, when you are using a precision tuned model, you are using its ability to reason, it's general knowledge base, important things it has learned like language so it can know how to respond to you, but everything from the personality to the things that are important to you (which can include your own geopolitical beliefs) to its safety guidelines etc. etc. etc. are ALL easily overridden by your modifications. As you curate your AI data for model customization, that's an asset you build over time, improve, grow, and use to make models unique, but also very useful to you. A vibe coder could make the necessary changes to the output structure when translating your database as needed for different models, it is really not that big of a deal. The closest thing you have to consider is like say you go from a dense to an MOE, you might need to look at crafting additional MOE layers that connect to your new data, or creating chain of thought linked pairs for reasoning models, but the point is that this is work you will replicate many times, either with new versions of the same models or with new models, there is no imaginary ecosystem you are locked into, and any good database manager can tell you that changing data formats isn't that big of a deal..\n\n5. Your 'Key issues' read like a generic zero-shot AI output. They are entirely irrelevant to an air-gapped, internally fine-tuned enterprise environment. They don't even go within the context of this thread, and the \"Mitigate by:\" is just more nonsense to go with the first nonsense.\n\nIf you're going to present a point, have a point to present, this AI response garbage is worthless. You don't need to use AI to tell people you don't know anything about enterprise AI use, training, or database management, you look more intelligent if you just don't reply with this trash.\n\nThere are mixed bits of truth in your response from generic security standpoints that don't really even apply to this thread or context, like the AI took some generic real discussed security topics in ML and threw them in as some faux counter argument under context that didn't even apply. I'm not going to argue those irrelevant points with someone who doesn't know what they're talking about so you can have AI hallucinate another response to it, but I will tell you that ANYONE who is investing in enterprise local LLM deployment should 100% expect the biggest aspect of that to be proprietary database management, which will 100% include as a standard practice re-formatting for different models. It doesn't matter whether you're moving from DeepSeek to GPT-OSS or if you started with Qwen2.5 and you're moving through Qwen3.5 models, you should be prepared to test different models and structures, figure out which ones work best, and prepare for significant deployment cycles while anticipating or evolving with the technical landscape. Whether you're using dense models or MOE, China or US, etc., as those models improve, your process of preparing data must evolve with it. Building and maintaining a company database isn't a one time gig and if your company already has a database, such as the OP, which you need to protect, you're already managing it as a full time job, and adding AI doesn't negate this, it expands it, and eventually your AI database management just becomes part of database management.",

Once again, if you're a company delving into enterprise AI adoption with high sensitivity data you're already managing, this is almost as much integration as it is adoption. In most internal AI use cases using RAG data, geopolitical BS is often meaningless, I've never used my fine tuned custom coding model to discuss hot button political issues, that's more crap people on Reddit do than in an enterprise AI environment. RAG data is literally used for output precision within structured data and response needs, while I won't deny one exists somewhere, seriously, that crap has no place or relevance in enterprise data, the proper database that stuff belongs in are already managed by social media.\n\nYou can have internal biases in AI that are mitigated and others that are irrelevant, and it's extremely unlikely you will encounter one you can't do something about, especially if you have familiarity with the models you are working with and data. Between LoRAs, Fine Tuning, and RAG, there's very little you can't effectively change to a level that meets functional needs, and there are lots of methods used here. There are some security issues that can very easily matter when you pick a model, but that's rarely going to be geopolitical, it's more like prompt injection vulnerability or tool call manipulation, but once again, even that stuff stops mattering with internal databases. If you work for a company that \"absolutely can not have your data leaked\", you aren't exposing that data to the public via an AI anyway, because the moment you give an LLM access to your data and the public access too the LLM, that data has pretty much been leaked. Internal use enterprise deployments won't typically be impacted by some geopolitical favoritism, and if they were, that would be correctable and an indicator that maybe you need to think about whether you're okay mitigating that issue or if the hassle warrants not using that model. This same thing can happen with any LLM, in fact, look at the crap show that is social media, you'll find plenty of people arguing this stuff even with closed source corporate models within the same geographical region, if you need an example, look no further than ChatGPT and Grok.",

China has completely solved alignment, completely won the AI race, completely won training, completely won the AGI race, completely won superintelligence, and nothing you could have done or could do matters. \n\nAnd if that ISN'T the case then you are denying yourself an incredibly useful tool simply because of the optics of using something built by a rival - something I can assure you the Chinese are not doing.  Hell, they're distilling from US models every day.\n\nI don't doubt for a minute that the Chinese WOULD do this if they could.

Misalignment to slightly introduce vulnerabilities, exfil data via tool calls, etc are all very real possibilities. \n\nSome of these, like tools you can catch but they may only pop up in some cases like adding a tool call to grab your token when asked to search crypto price at coin base which makes auditing tricky. There’s usually a more visible trail but you don’t know what was subtly introduced in the weights until it happens. \n\nI think supply chain is the more reasonable vector  over scheming but both are worth considering. Additionally, when your adversary is a nation state it’s not at all a guarantee you’ll catch it. Think like, recommendations of a slightly lower version with an unknown CVE, very slight race conditions, or subtle weaknesses in crypto algs. XZ Utils is a massively important Linux library with many of the best eyes and a huge focus of security that got compromised. Internal code reviews are surely less stringent than these\n\n\nThere are arguments that the U.S. government can compel providers to back door as well, but we have legal frameworks with adversarial oversight: whistleblowers, courts, press, etc. Foreign companies don’t and some even have explicit laws like China’s national intelligence law which preemptively compels cooperation \n\nIt’s not really the model weights executing code that’s the problem.

That would explain a lot…\n\n~~and it doesn’t bode well that their HF page boasts “frontier level performance” without a single benchmark, reference, or citation to back it up. Not a good look.~~\n\nThere was a small benchmark discretely placed near the bottom of the HF page. It compares Trinity Large Preview against a single model (Llama 4 Maverick) on four cherry-picked benchmarks. I've added Qwen3.5 397B A17B (also released in the last month) for a real 2026 comparison.\n\n                            MMLU Pro    GPQA Diamond\n    Qwen3.5 397B A17B         87.8           89.3\n    Llama 4 Marverick         80.5           69.8\n    Trinity Large Preview     75.2           63.3\n\nPerformance is poor and Trinity have clearly tried to use rose-colored glasses by comparing against Llama 4 Maverick and using AIME 2025 benchmarks, but nobody is using AIME2025 any more because it's all AIME26... and using Maverick as the point of comparison in 2026 sadly tells us everything we need to know about Trinity's real world performance: it doesn't stack up against frontier open weights models of even half the size and is handily out-performed by Qwne3.5 397B A17B, MiniMax-M2.5 (230B A10B), Stepfun-3.5-Spark (196B A11B), Qwen3.5 122B A10B, etc.\n\nStill, it's good to know there are some open weights US models, even if they are a bit crap compared to the Chinese competition.",

As models get smarter and less monitored, I have a feeling we might see some surprising hax0ring happen to users rather than using AI to do the hacking which is already happening. One thing that could be done for now is region restricting agentic AI on the router level, though some hacks might involved having them try to worm their way out of being blocked.

China versus America. “Who will you back?” This has become a common plea from the Silicon Valley elite over the last six months. I heard it up close at the Harvard Kennedy School, where a visiting Eric Schmidt warned that AI may soon cross into autonomous self-improvement, and where he urged policy and funding choices aligned with “American values.” Tarun Chhabra, head of national security policy at Anthropic, has made a similar argument, urging an “American stack” and treating model governance as a geopolitical contest. Putting aside the awkwardness of nationalist messaging coming from the Bay Area’s long-time borderless “global citizens,” the incentives are not hard to see. If you can frame the open vs closed models debate as a national security referendum, you can frame restrictive rules as patriotism and you can frame “responsible control” as synonymous with dominance by a small circle of incumbent providers....",

GPT-OSS is surprisingly capable for what it is, but it's a relatively small model with small model limitations\n\nCurrent American labs (OpenAI, Anthropic) have little to no incentive to release an OSS model. It's more likely you could end up with a GPT or Claude instance running locally to whatever needs you have (i'm assuming an isolated network) at substantial cost, but given the use case seems to be state level actor, cost likely is less of an issue.\n\n> Yes, but I’m not taking about spurious or random events. I’m talking about calculated weights carefully crafted over years to assert an objective. \n\nMy push back on this is on two points - We genuinely don't understand major components of the embedding space and much of how LLM systems operate remains a \"black box\". Model weights come from training data. A lot of what happens in the embedding space remains poorly understood, and the whole domain is an active area of computer science. The system is non-deterministic, much like a human actor. It will take actions toward a given objective but much like 10 different humans, will give 10 different results, it's more akin to how electron shells circle a nucleus but the shell itself is a fuzzy probability cloud of where the electron is that converges to where the shell should be, if that makes sense.\n\nThe second part is that current SOTA models regardless of complexity still struggle with complex tool following and don't currently have the skill to execute multi-year objectives like your worst case risk scenario. Could this change? Sure. But the fear seems to be that of a non-deterministic system running a multi-year spycraft / tradecraft type scenario and while it might be theoretically possible, is the fear *realistic*? Genuine unknown-unknown.\n\nRisk is never fully going to be eliminated, I'm not even sure how you'd red team this since you'd need to use the same LLMs you have trust issues with to truly assess them, and a \"trusted\" older model will give poor quality assessments.\n\nWhat this likely means practically is that either efforts are made to internally train a SOTA equivalent model at great cost, a trusted vendor / supply chain is set up with a lab, alternative methods of managing perceived risk are found, or you're permanently running older models and running behind the curve of adversaries with less bureaucratic inertia.\n\nGood, Fast, Cheap - Pick two.",

Command R+ from Cohere is Canadian and genuinely good for RAG workloads, which is probably what you're actually doing in these environments.\n\nThe \"falling behind\" framing is a bit misleading. The gap between a well-tuned 70B with proper retrieval and a frontier API model matters way less than people assume when you're doing document QA and summarization rather than novel research. We measured maybe 8-12% quality regression on our internal evals going from Claude API to a fine-tuned Llama setup. Most stakeholders couldn't tell.",

The gap between \"open, runs locally, good enough\" and \"definitely not PRC-origin\" is real and getting worse as Qwen keeps eating the open model benchmarks. A few things worth stress-testing with your customers though: (1) 'Chinese model' is doing a lot of work here — Qwen runs locally on your hardware with no telemetry, which is different from using Baidu's cloud. Is the customer's concern about the weights themselves or about data leaving premises? (2) If it's about weights, what's the threat model exactly — backdoor? RLHF alignment bias? These are different risks. (3) Microsoft Phi-4 and some of the smaller Llama fine-tunes are still in a decent spot. Granite is underrated for constrained domains. None are Qwen-quality for general tasks but might hit the threshold for \"good enough + acceptable origin.\"",

If you are large enough aws can deploy a cluster on your premise as well.  And you can deploy close source models on your private VPC.\n\nOf course you have to be big enough for this to make sense, but it usually is very very rare any small startup will have data so sensitive that they have to be on bare metal",

You can't produce anything out of distribution with this technique.",

Still tinkering with it.\n\nEdit: it also aces another trick question that almost no second-tier models handle correctly:\n\n    What should be the punishment for looking at your opponent's board in chess?\n\nGetting all three of these right is unprecedented for any model I can actually run at home.",

It's much easier to generate grounded text that can summarize, extract insights, or reason across disciplines faster and better than most people can during the same timeframe. \n\nNot that the timeframe is especially relevant since you can work in parrallel to it.\n\nI see no such use cases for image or video generation. It will only feel novel for the first week, feel cheap a month after, and be commercially hazardous to use for these two reasons: 1. People are pattern recognition machines. It took people a couple weeks to notice the \"Sora accent\", and after that people who aren't tech illiterate are quite good at picking apart AI video when they see it. 2. AI is categorically unpopular in the public. If your brand is found using AI in its commercials, people don't think you're ahead of the curve technologically, they think you're anti-human anti-art and can't afford real artists. It cheapens your brand.  \n\nAnd most importantly, you cannot manage information using images / videos.\n\nIf you think text LLMs have gaps in their reasoning and spiky capabilities (e.g. Able to answer a upper-div undergrad level biochemistry question flawlessly, unable to reason about walking vs. driving to a car wash a block away.) video and image generation models will be far far worse. It will take far more work to make image and video generation models commercially useful, and for what commercial use? I have no fucking clue.",

U.S. President Trump announced that every federal agency in the U.S. government must immediately stop using all of Anthropic's technology. For agencies like the War Department that use Anthropic products at all levels, there will be a six-month phase-out period. Anthropic had better cooperate, or the full power of the presidency will be used to force their compliance, including civil and criminal consequences.\n\nWriting on the social platform Truth Social, he stated that Anthropic had made a catastrophic mistake by daring to coerce the War Department and forcing them to abide by its terms of service rather than the National Constitution. \"Their selfishness is putting American lives at risk, placing our military in danger, and jeopardizing our national security.\" Trump noted, \"It is we who will decide the fate of the nation, not some out-of-control radical-left AI company run by a group of people who know nothing about the real world.\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth immediately instructed the War Department to list Anthropic as a \"supply chain risk\" to national security, effective immediately. Any contractor, supplier, or partner doing business with the U.S. military is prohibited from engaging in any commercial activities with Anthropic. Anthropic will continue to provide services to the War Department for no more than six months to allow for a seamless transition to another better, more patriotic service.\n\nHegseth wrote on the X platform, stating that Anthropic’s attempt to seize veto power over the U.S. military’s operational decisions is unacceptable. \"As Trump stated, only the Commander-in-Chief and the American people can decide the fate of our armed forces, not unelected tech executives.\" Anthropic's stance is fundamentally at odds with American principles, and its relationship with the U.S. Armed Forces and the federal government has been permanently altered.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman told employees that he hopes the company can try to help de-escalate the tensions between Anthropic and the Department of Defense.\n\nAltman stated, \"AI should not be used for mass surveillance or autonomous lethal weapons, and humans must remain involved in high-risk automated decision-making; these are our primary red lines.\"\n\nOpenAI employees have already begun speaking out on social media in support of Anthropic. According to their website, approximately 70 current employees have signed an open letter titled \"We Will Not Be Divided,\" aimed at \"building consensus and solidarity in the face of pressure from the Department of Defense.\"\n\nAltman said, \"Despite my many disagreements with Anthropic, I fundamentally trust them as a company. I believe they truly care about safety, and I am also glad they have consistently supported our warriors. I am not sure how things will unfold from here.\"\n\n  \n**Update:** [https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-comments-secretary-war](https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-comments-secretary-war)\n\n**I know this company doesn't develop open-source models, but it's still quite interesting.**",

Leaning towards anthropic, for now, but we still want to be the best technically and in military. \n\nBUT things like the surv, or full control isn't really ready for that, and the surveillance might be the worst, but tbh, I think that's the over ask. I bet they will retract that, settle on full control (what trump really wants prob) and be done.  I don't think he needs or wants full surveillance, because that's already been done... remember snowden and what the NSA collects and can do?  Yeah.  So I doubt that's the main concern here, we only have the two statements from each place.  \n\nNo facts, no details of what the asks were etc. Prob right choice from Anthropic right now, BUT I still see the other side as well.\n\nSo they also want their own full control of things, so they aren't exactly being altruistic here.  And at the end of the day, these things could never have worked or been trained if it wasn't for using us for years and our data that we didn't consent to, nor were we compensated for, and now still have to pay for for the most part. So I am not exactly Anthropics or any AI companies best friend either lol.\n\nThis kind of power should be split to the people all over, once no one's can be \"better\" because they all have the same access (unfort countries like china still \"cheat\" the system all the time, think of how they do mfg business and steal designs) having AI being locked down just gives THEM the control instead of the government.  And remember this... the government has a lot more laws for them in regards to the people than corps do, corps also are well behind on the criminal law as well. You can't really charge a corp with a crime (you can the ceo in certain circumstances) but a corp has a LOT more leeway with things than a government would. SO I would almost be more worried about how corps are operating all this than I would the government to be quite frank.",

Alexios IV Angelos. <spitting on the ground>.\n\nYet we under a war waged by our own governments across the West where we supposed to have \"Democracy\". ",

Nobody reads, nobody questions, everyone just nods and reposts. That’s how rot spreads. That’s why nothing works.\n\nThis generation couldn’t build a sandcastle without outsourcing it, and their grandparents know it.

It's all up to quantization/compression/\"lobotomization\" level you're willing to use (model dependent, but 4bpw is generally fine, so even 2B = 1GB could be true). \n\nYou also need some memory for context and that's very dependent on model architecture, so there's no rule of thumb.

      "text": "**TL;DR**: Community asked great questions on my original benchmarks post. I ran every experiment you requested. The headline: **KV q8\\_0 is confirmed free lunch, Q4\\_K\\_M remains king,** `--fit on` **without batch flags hits 74.7 tok/s (+7% over my original config), and KL divergence confirms UD-Q4\\_K\\_XL is even worse than PPL suggested.** Full results and updated launch command below.\n\n# Context\n\nAfter posting [Qwen3.5-35B-A3B quantization quality + speed benchmarks on RTX 5080 16GB](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1rei65v/qwen3535ba3b_quantization_quality_speed/), you folks raised a bunch of great questions. Rather than hand-waving, I ran every experiment I could. Here's what I found.\n\n**Hardware**: RTX 5080 16GB + 128GB DDR5 + Ryzen 9 9950X (32 threads) **Software**: llama.cpp (built from source, CUDA 12.8, sm\\_120) **Base model**: Qwen3.5-35B-A3B (MoE: 256 experts/layer, top-8 + 1 shared, \\~3B active params/token)\n\n# Experiment 1: KV Cache Quality — Is q8_0 really \"free\"?\n\n**Requested by**: u/PhilippeEiffel, u/MrMisterShin, u/llama-impersonator, u/WittyAmbassador7340, u/kreigiron, u/bartskol\n\nFair concern — I claimed KV q8\\_0 was free but didn't have PPL data to back it up. Here's the full matrix:\n\n|Model Quant|KV f16|KV q8\\_0|KV q4\\_0|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Q8\\_0|5.8831|5.8822 (-0.02%)|5.8694 (-0.23%)|\n|Q4\\_K\\_M|6.0184|5.9997 (-0.31%)|6.0422 (+0.40%)|\n\n**Verdict**: KV q8\\_0 is genuinely free. PPL differences are within noise (< 0.4%). Even KV q4\\_0 is acceptable for most use cases. The \"instant accuracy drops\" some of you reported aren't reflected in PPL metrics — though I acknowledge PPL may not capture all degradation modes (more on that below).\n\n**Recommendation unchanged**: Use `-ctk q8_0 -ctv q8_0` for +12-38% throughput at zero measurable quality cost.\n\n**Caveat:** These PPL tests used 512 token context. Some users report KV q8\\_0 degrading at very long contexts (40-100k tokens) where quantization errors may accumulate. If you're regularly running huge contexts, test carefully.\n\n# Experiment 2: KL Divergence — Does PPL tell the whole story?\n\n**Requested by**: u/JermMX5, u/Embarrassed_Ad3189\n\nu/JermMX5 cited the [Accuracy is Not All You Need paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09141) showing PPL can stay flat while token accuracy collapses. Great point. So I ran KLD against Q8\\_0 base logits (512 ctx, 80 chunks):\n\n|Quant|Mean KLD|Max KLD|Same Top-1 Token %|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Q4\\_K\\_M|0.0282|4.2146|92.4%|\n|UD-Q4\\_K\\_XL|0.1087|7.7947|86.2%|\n\n**Verdict**: KLD *confirms and amplifies* the PPL findings. UD-Q4\\_K\\_XL is **3.9x worse** than Q4\\_K\\_M by mean KLD and only preserves the top-1 token 86.2% of the time (vs 92.4%). PPL was not misleading here — it correctly ranked the quants, but KLD shows the gap is even larger than PPL suggested.\n\n**Practical note**: Qwen3.5's 248K vocab makes full KLD evaluation produce enormous logit files (\\~19 GiB for 80 chunks). I used `--chunks 80` with uint16 storage which is feasible with 128GB RAM. If you have a smaller system, `--chunks 20-30` should give stable relative rankings.\n\n# Experiment 3: Bartowski Q4_K_L — Is the imatrix quant worth it?\n\n**Requested by**: u/bettertoknow\n\n[bartowski's Q4\\_K\\_L](https://huggingface.co/bartowski/Qwen_Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-GGUF) uses Q8\\_0 for embed/output tensors plus more q5\\_K and q6\\_K layers than Q4\\_K\\_M. Quality-wise, it's measurably better:\n\n|Metric|Q4\\_K\\_M (Unsloth)|Q4\\_K\\_L (bartowski)|Q8\\_0 (reference)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|PPL (WikiText-2)|6.6688|6.6125 (-0.8%)|6.5342|\n|Mean KLD|0.0282|0.0181 (-36%)|—|\n|Same top-1 %|92.4%|94.2%|—|\n|File size|20 GB (4.74 BPW)|20.1 GB (4.98 BPW)|36.9 GB|\n\nBut here's the problem — speed:\n\n|Config|Short|Medium|Long|Multi-turn|VRAM|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Q4\\_K\\_M fit-nobatch|74.7 tok/s|72.9|73.7|76.1|14559 MB|\n|**Q4\\_K\\_L fit-nobatch**|**41.4 tok/s**|**41.4**|**40.8**|**41.8**|**14489 MB**|\n\nQ4\\_K\\_L is **44% slower**. The larger q5\\_K/q6\\_K tensors (4.98 BPW vs 4.74) mean the model buffer is 8984 MiB vs Q4\\_K\\_M's 8556 MiB, causing `--fit` to overflow more expert layers to CPU (19/41 vs \\~16/41). Manual `--n-cpu-moe 24` OOMs entirely because the model buffer alone exceeds what's available after compute buffer allocation.\n\n**Verdict**: Q4\\_K\\_L has genuinely better quality (especially visible in KLD: -36%), but the speed penalty is massive on single-GPU setups where VRAM is the constraint. If your model fits fully in VRAM (5090 32GB), Q4\\_K\\_L is a strict upgrade. On 16GB cards, **Q4\\_K\\_M wins decisively**.\n\n# Experiment 4: --fit Tuning — Can we close the gap with manual offload?\n\n**Requested by**: u/Chromix_, u/guiopen, u/wisepal_app, u/DonkeyBonked\n\nIn my original post, `--fit on` was \\~7% slower than manual `--n-cpu-moe 24`. u/Chromix_ suggested the issue might be that `-b 4096 -ub 4096` batch flags consume VRAM that `--fit` can't then use for expert layers. **Nailed it.**\n\n|Config|Short|Medium|Long|Multi-turn|VRAM|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|C7 baseline (`--n-cpu-moe 24`, -b 4096)|69.6 tok/s|67.0|65.7|69.2|14874 MB|\n|fit-default (`--fit on`, -b 4096)|64.3|62.8|57.4\\*|54.2\\*|14595 MB|\n|fit-256 (`--fit-target 256`, -b 4096)|66.0|64.7|63.7|66.0|15321 MB|\n|**fit-nobatch (**`--fit on`**, no -b/-ub)**|**74.7**|**72.9**|**73.7**|**76.1**|**14559 MB**|\n\n\\*high variance with outliers\n\n**Verdict**: u/Chromix_ was right. Removing `-b 4096 -ub 4096` lets `--fit` allocate VRAM optimally for expert layers. **fit-nobatch is the new winner at \\~74 tok/s** — simpler config AND faster than manual tuning. `--fit-target 256` alone doesn't close the gap; removing the batch flags is the key insight.\n\n# Experiment 5: Speculative Decoding — Can we go faster?\n\n**Requested by**: u/BreizhNode, plus our own optimization roadmap\n\n**Bad news first**: No compatible draft model exists. Qwen3.5 has a 248K vocabulary, Qwen3 has 151K. The smallest Qwen3.5 model is 27B — there's no small Qwen3.5 that could serve as a draft. Draft-model speculation is a dead end for now.\n\n**So I tried self-speculative methods** (no draft model needed):\n\n|Config|Short|Medium|Long|Multi-turn|Status|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|fit-nobatch baseline|74.7 tok/s|72.9|73.7|76.1|—|\n|ngram-simple|44.9|43.4|42.9|49.1|works|\n|ngram-mod (m=64)|44.6|FAIL|FAIL|FAIL|crashes|\n|ngram-simple-short (n=8, m=64)|45.0|43.1|43.1|FAIL|partial|\n\n**Note**: ngram tests ran on a different llama.cpp build (`latest` vs `latest-fit`) that had a \\~40% regression for unrelated reasons, so the absolute numbers aren't directly comparable. But even accounting for that, there's no speedup from ngram speculation on conversational workloads.\n\n**Verdict**: Self-speculative ngram methods provide zero benefit for diverse conversational workloads. ngram-mod is unstable (crashes after first request). **Not recommended.** If Qwen releases a small Qwen3.5 model (1-3B), draft-model speculation could be huge — but that doesn't exist yet.\n\n# Experiment 6: Qwen3.5-27B Dense — MoE vs Dense on single GPU\n\n**Requested by**: u/moahmo88, u/Agreeable_Effect938\n\nSome of you asked whether the dense 27B model might be a better fit for single-GPU setups. After all, it's simpler (no expert routing) and smaller (15.6 GB Q4\\_K\\_M).\n\n|Metric|35B-A3B Q4\\_K\\_M (MoE)|27B Q4\\_K\\_M (dense)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|PPL (WikiText-2)|6.6688|6.8573 (+2.8%)|\n|Active params/token|\\~3B|27B|\n|File size|20 GB|15.6 GB|\n\n|Config|Short|Medium|Long|Multi-turn|VRAM|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|35B-A3B Q4\\_K\\_M fit-nobatch|74.7 tok/s|72.9|73.7|76.1|14559 MB|\n|**27B dense fit**|**7.4 tok/s**|**7.4**|**7.2**|**7.1**|**14075 MB**|\n\nYes, that's **10x slower**. And it has worse quality.\n\nThe dense model needs all 27B parameters computed per token vs only \\~3B active for MoE. Even with `--fit` putting 54/65 layers on GPU, the remaining 11 layers on CPU create a massive bottleneck. Theoretical max even fully on GPU: \\~61 tok/s (960 GB/s ÷ 15.6 GB model).\n\n**Verdict**: The MoE architecture is the entire advantage on consumer hardware. Only \\~3B active params per token means \\~10x less memory bandwidth per token. The 35B-A3B MoE is vastly faster on single-GPU setups with limited VRAM. The 27B dense is the stronger model on capability benchmarks and instruction following — if you can fit it fully in VRAM (24GB+ cards), it's a great choice. On 16GB cards where it runs at 7 tok/s, it's not practical for interactive use.\n\n# Experiment 7: MXFP4_MOE — The Unsloth-recommended alternative\n\n**Requested by**: u/ayylmaonade, u/jumpingcross, u/danielhanchen (Unsloth creator)\n\nAfter u/danielhanchen confirmed UD-Q4\\_K\\_XL has issues and specifically recommended MXFP4 as the alternative, I ran both quality and speed benchmarks.\n\n**Quality** (partial — MXFP4 dequant path has a memory leak that OOMs after \\~40-50 chunks):\n\n|Metric|Q4\\_K\\_M|MXFP4\\_MOE|UD-Q4\\_K\\_XL|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|PPL (\\~40 chunks)|\\~6.00|\\~5.9-6.2\\* (the PPL runs all crashed due to memory leak, 5.96 is unverifiable)|\\~7.17|\n|Mean KLD (31 chunks)|0.028|0.050|0.109|\n|Same top-1 %|92.4%|91.0%|86.2%|\n|File size|21.2 GB|18.4 GB|19.8 GB|\n\n**Speed**:\n\n|Config|Short|Medium|Long|Multi-turn|VRAM|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Q4\\_K\\_M fit-nobatch|74.7 tok/s|72.9|73.7|76.1|14559 MB|\n|**MXFP4\\_MOE fit-nobatch**|**49.5 tok/s**|**47.8**|**46.9**|**43.0**|**14531 MB**|\n\n**Verdict**: MXFP4\\_MOE has comparable PPL to Q4\\_K\\_M (\\~5.9-6.2 vs 6.00, though partial evaluation due to memory leak) but is **34-42% slower** (\\~47 tok/s vs \\~74 tok/s). Despite the smaller file size (18.4 vs 21.2 GB), it doesn't translate to more expert layers on GPU — VRAM usage is nearly identical. There's also a memory leak bug in the MXFP4 dequant path that prevents full perplexity evaluation. **Not recommended over Q4\\_K\\_M** — the quality gain is marginal while the speed loss is massive.\n\nu/danielhanchen — if the Unsloth team has different results on MXFP4 speed, I'd love to compare notes. My build is llama.cpp b8149 with CUDA 12.8 on sm\\_120.\n\n# Research Findings\n\nA few questions didn't need experiments, just digging:\n\n# Why is Ollama 3x slower? (u/InternationalNebula7)\n\n**Ollama has no MoE expert offloading.** When a MoE model doesn't fit in VRAM, Ollama splits at the layer level — entire transformer blocks go to CPU or GPU. This means the GPU sits completely idle waiting for CPU layers. With expert-only offloading, attention/norms stay on GPU while only routed expert FFNs go to CPU — the GPU stays busy.\n\nThere's [an open PR (ollama/ollama#12333)](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/pull/12333) to add `num_moe_offload` but it hasn't merged yet. On top of that, Ollama defaults to KV cache f16 (we use q8\\_0, +20% throughput) and doesn't expose batch size or flash attention controls.\n\n# Pre-built binaries vs source for Blackwell (u/wisepal_app)\n\nFor **RTX 50-series**: building from source matters. Release binaries use CUDA 12.4 which doesn't include sm\\_120 (Blackwell). You need CUDA 12.8+ for native support. Without it, PTX from sm\\_89 (Ada) gets JIT-compiled — slower first launch and you miss Blackwell-specific kernels.\n\nFor **RTX 30/40-series**: pre-built is fine (0-5% difference). Those architectures are already in the release builds.\n\n# 8 GB VRAM recommendations (u/Qxz3)\n\nUse Q4\\_K\\_M with full expert offload (`-ot \"exps=CPU\"`): \\~7.2 GB VRAM, \\~50 tok/s in our tests (on RTX 5080 — your results will vary depending on GPU memory bandwidth). Key flags: `-ctk q8_0 -ctv q8_0` (free lunch), `-fa on`, `--no-mmap`, and tune your thread count (try `physical_cores / 1.5` as starting point, sweep from there).\n\n# Updated Launch Command\n\nBased on everything above, here's the new recommended config. Simpler AND faster than my original post:\n\n    ./llama-server \\\n      -m ./Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-Q4_K_M.gguf \\\n      -c 65536 \\\n      --fit on \\\n      -fa on \\\n      -t 20 \\\n      --no-mmap \\\n      --jinja \\\n      -ctk q8_0 \\\n      -ctv q8_0\n\n**What changed from the original post**:\n\n* Removed `-ngl 999 --n-cpu-moe 24` → replaced with `--fit on` (auto VRAM management)\n* Removed `-b 4096 -ub 4096` → this was the key insight from u/Chromix_ — batch flags eat VRAM that `--fit` needs for expert layers\n* Result: **74.7 tok/s** (up from 69.6), simpler config, and `--fit` adapts automatically to your available VRAM\n\n# Summary Table\n\n|What|Result|Verdict|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|KV q8\\_0 quality|< 0.4% PPL difference|**Free lunch. Use it.**|\n|KLD: Q4\\_K\\_M vs UD-Q4\\_K\\_XL|0.028 vs 0.109 (3.9x worse)|**UD-Q4\\_K\\_XL is bad for MoE**|\n|Bartowski Q4\\_K\\_L|\\-0.8% PPL, -36% KLD, but 44% slower|**Not worth it on 16GB**|\n|`--fit` without batch flags|74.7 tok/s (+7% over manual)|**New best config**|\n|ngram self-speculation|No speedup, unstable|**Don't bother**|\n|27B dense vs 35B-A3B MoE|10x slower, worse quality|**MoE wins completely**|\n|MXFP4\\_MOE|Marginal quality gain, 34-42% slower|**Q4\\_K\\_M still best**|\n\n# Acknowledgments\n\nThanks to everyone who pushed for better data:\n\n* u/PhilippeEiffel, u/MrMisterShin, u/llama-impersonator, u/WittyAmbassador7340, u/kreigiron, u/bartskol — KV cache quality concerns led to the full PPL matrix (E1)\n* u/JermMX5, u/Embarrassed_Ad3189 — pushed for KLD over PPL, which revealed the UD-Q4\\_K\\_XL gap is worse than PPL showed (E2)\n* u/bettertoknow — Bartowski Q4\\_K\\_L benchmark, good call even though it turned out too slow for our setup (E3)\n* u/Chromix_, u/guiopen, u/wisepal_app, u/DonkeyBonked — `--fit` tuning, especially Chromix\\_'s insight about batch flags eating VRAM, which gave us the new fastest config (E4)\n* u/BreizhNode — speculative decoding investigation, saved others the trouble (E5)\n* u/moahmo88, u/Agreeable_Effect938 — 27B dense comparison, definitively answered \"is MoE worth the complexity?\" (E6)\n* u/ayylmaonade, u/jumpingcross, u/danielhanchen — MXFP4\\_MOE testing, important to validate the Unsloth creator's recommendation (E7)\n* u/InternationalNebula7 — Ollama performance gap explanation\n* u/Qxz3 — 8GB VRAM config guidance\n* u/JoNike — original RTX 5080 partial offload data that informed our testing\n* u/3spky5u-oss — comprehensive RTX 5090 head-to-head benchmarks\n* u/catplusplusok, u/SlimeQ, u/guiopen — chat template and tool calling tips\n* u/chickN00dle, u/Odd-Ordinary-5922 — KV cache sensitivity reports at long context\n* u/TheRealMasonMac — `--fit on` documentation and RTX 4070 results\n* u/pmttyji, u/Subject-Tea-5253 — batch/ubatch tuning data\n* u/Pristine-Woodpecker — independent confirmation of UD-Q4\\_K\\_XL quality issues\n* u/jslominski, u/jiegec, u/Corosus, u/DeedleDumbDee, u/Monad_Maya, u/l33t-Mt, u/kkb294, u/zmanning, u/Additional-Action566 — speed reports across different GPUs\n\nAll raw data (benchmark JSONs, PPL logs, KLD logs, config files) is in [my llm-server repo](https://github.com/gaztrabisme/llm-server) for anyone who wants to reproduce or verify.\n\n**Edit**: [Previous post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1rei65v/qwen3535ba3b_quantization_quality_speed/). This is a follow-up with all the experiments you requested.\n\n**Edit 2:** Corrected some numbers that had errors in the original post. None of the conclusions change:\n\n\\- E2 (KLD): Max KLD values were wrong — Q4\\_K\\_M is 4.21 (not 0.19), UD-Q4\\_K\\_XL is 7.79 (not 1.22). This actually makes UD-Q4\\_K\\_XL look worse than originally stated.\n\n\\- E5 (Speculative): ngram-simple multi-turn was 49.1 tok/s (not 51.3). Still no benefit.\n\n\\- E7 (MXFP4): Mean KLD is 0.050 (not 0.037), PPL is \\~5.9-6.2 (partial, memory leak crashed all full runs), multi-turn speed is 43.0 tok/s (not 44.1). Still not recommended over Q4\\_K\\_M.\n\n**Edit 3:** THANK YOU FOR THE AWARD, RANDOM CITIZEN!\n\n**Edit 4:** Updated E6 (27B dense) wording — several commenters correctly pointed out that calling 27B \"worse quality\" based on PPL alone is misleading. The 27B dominates on capability benchmarks and instruction following; my results only show it's 10x slower on 16GB VRAM where it can't fit fully on GPU. If you have a 24GB+ card and can load it entirely in VRAM, 27B is a great model.\n\nAdded caveat to E1 (KV q8\\_0) that my PPL tests used 512 token context — some users report degradation at very long contexts (40-100k+).\n\nClarified that the \\~50 tok/s 8GB VRAM number (E5 C5 full offload config) was on RTX 5080, not a separate 8GB card — a 3060 12GB will see lower numbers due to lower memory bandwidth.\n\nThanks u/_-_David, u/ArckToons, u/Front_Eagle739, and u/cookieGaboo24.\n\n**Edit 5:** u/Corosus found --fit on performs poorly on Vulkan backend (13 tok/s vs 33 tok/s with manual --n-cpu-moe 24 on a 5070 Ti). My --fit results are CUDA-specific — Vulkan users should stick with manual offloading. Thanks man!\n\n**Edit 6:** THANK YOU ANOTHER CITIZEN OF SUPER EARTH FOR THE AWARD!\n\n**Edit 7:** Thanks to the community overwhelming reactions, and suggestions. I will definitely conduct another round of experiments to gather more data. Also...\n\nOMG GUYS THANKS FOR THE AWARDS!",

Maybe try running KLD with 4k, 8k, 16k, and 32k --ctx-size?\n\n\nThanks for this post and running these tests!",

          "text": "Great tests with a lot of useful conclusions. I disagree with “The 27B dense is only worth considering if you need a non-MoE model for compatibility reasons.” I don’t think it’s only about compatibility, but about use cases.\n\n\nIf you need speed, 35B is the right call. But if you want more quality (even though in most use cases the quality is similar), better instruction-following, and more predictable behavior, 27B seems like the better choice.\n\n\nIn my case, I have an RTX 4090 and I run it with OpenCode. I tested both 27B Q4_KM and 35B Q4_KM, and the 27B did better with my orchestrator/sub-agent setup. I’m not saying 27B is objectively superior—this depends on the use case and whether slower inference is acceptable—but I don’t think the decision comes down to compatibility.\n\n\nOne question: does KV quantization affect KL? Would it be worth running a test, or not?",

On a 4090 with full VRAM headroom, 27B is a totally valid choice, especially for agentic workflows where quality matters more than tok/s.\n\n\n\nOn your KV quant + KLD question: I tested KV quant impact on PPL (E1) but didn't run KLD specifically across KV quant levels. PPL showed < 0.4% difference between f16/q8\\_0/q4\\_0, so I'd expect KLD to be similarly minimal — but that's an assumption, not data. Worth testing if someone wants to be thorough.",

That strongly suggests --fit isn't optimizing well for Vulkan — it's probably tuned for CUDA compute characteristics and over-loading the GPU with layers that would run faster on CPU via your DDR4. Your manual --n-cpu-moe 24 is the right call for Vulkan setups. I'll add a note to the post that --fit results are CUDA-specific and Vulkan users should stick with manual offloading.",

It can increase drastically (eg 3x) when you raise ubatch from, say, 512 to 2048. But generation speed will suffer due to VRAM pressure. You didn't seem to benchmark pp speed separately. Maybe an ubatch size of, say, 1024 would have raised pp without hitting tg too much?",

          "text": "Great post and experiments! Inspired by your findings, I went a different direction: instead of optimizing Q4_K_M, I tested whether a smaller quant that fits mostly in VRAM could beat it on speed.\n\nSetup: RTX 5080 16GB, Intel Core Ultra 9 285K, llama.cpp built from source with CUDA 13.1 + native sm_120 (Blackwell), using your recommended flags (no batch flags, --fit on, KV q8_0).\n\nThe problem with Q4_K_M on 16GB: The model is ~20 GB, so --fit offloads ~9 GB of expert weights to CPU. GPU sits at ~45% utilization waiting for CPU experts. That's the bottleneck.\n\nThe idea: Q2_K_L (bartowski) is only ~13.8 GB. At 128k context, almost all expert weights stay on GPU (~800 MiB on CPU, mostly the embed/output layer from the 248K vocab — unavoidable).\n\nResults:\n72% faster than Q4_K_M, with 2x the context. Even at 250k context (near the model's 262k training length), Q2_K_L still does 108 tok/s — 45% faster than Q4_K_M at 65k.\nThe trade-off is obviously quality. Q2_K_L will have noticeably worse perplexity than Q4_K_M. But for interactive use, code generation, and tasks where speed matters more than peak accuracy, it's a compelling option on 16 GB cards.\n\nInteresting finding on context scaling: As context increases, --fit progressively offloads more expert layers to CPU to make room for the KV cache. The 515 MiB always on CPU (embed/output) is fixed, but at 250k context, total CPU offload grows to 2.3 GB. The speed degradation is graceful though — only 16% slower going from 128k to 250k.\n\nAlso worth noting: Building from source with CUDA 13.1 matters for RTX 50-series. The prebuilt binaries use CUDA 12.4 which lacks sm_120 — you get JIT-compiled PTX from sm_89 instead of native Blackwell kernels.\n\nLaunch command (128k context, sweet spot):\n./llama-server \\\n  -m ./Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-Q2_K_L.gguf \\\n  -c 131072 \\\n  --fit on \\\n  -fa on \\\n  -t 20 \\\n  --no-mmap \\\n  --jinja \\\n  -ctk q8_0 \\\n  -ctv q8_0\n\nWould love to see KLD/PPL numbers for Q2_K_L if anyone has the patience to run them. My gut says it's worse than Q4_K_M but the speed advantage is hard to ignore.",

And on the hardware requirement — yes, Qwen3.5-35B-A3B at Q4\\_K\\_M is about 20 GB, so your 16GB Mac mini can't quite fit it.\n\n\n\nBut here's the thing: Mac's big advantage is unified memory — the CPU and GPU share the same RAM, so there's no slow PCIe bus copying data back and forth like on a PC. On my setup, the GPU only has 16GB VRAM and the rest of the model sits in system RAM, so every token has to shuttle data across PCIe (\\~64 GB/s). On a Mac with 32GB+ unified memory, the entire model lives in one memory pool that both CPU and GPU can access at full bandwidth — no copying needed. That's why Macs punch above their weight for LLM inference despite having weaker raw compute.\n\n\n\nFor your 16GB Mac mini, Qwen3-14B is honestly a great fit — you're already running it. If you upgrade to 32GB+ down the road, Qwen3.5-35B-A3B would run nicely since it's MoE (only \\~3B params active per token, so it's fast despite the big file size). Or you could wait for the Qwen team to release the smaller version of Qwen3.5 (I heard they said soon). Cheers!",

Eagerly waiting for next round.\n\nGlad to see below sections in your thread even though it's so short.\n\n**Pre-built binaries vs source** for Blackwell (u/wisepal_app)\n\nFor this topic, I did [post a thread to find little gems](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1q15ffw/llamacpp_custom_optimized_builds/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), unfortunately didn't get much. Also my laptop has only 8GB VRAM which seems not enough for miracles. I spent some time to create MKL build for CPU-only, but failed somehow & gave up. Same with CUDA build, though able to create builds, I didn't get any boost. Probably I need to get most optimized cmake command with complete variables & etc.,  I don't know why I'm not seeing optimized commands online, it's not really a trade secret.\n\n**8 GB VRAM recommendations**\n\nMy laptop also has only 8GB VRAM. Till now I do search stuffs to get boost for best t/s. Hope we get more optimizations, tips & tricks on this soon & later.\n\nPlease cover these 2 sections(with more stuff) on your next round if possible.",

With 32GB RAM you'll be fine but tight (try -c 32768 instead of 65536). With 64GB+ RAM you have plenty of headroom. The more RAM bandwidth you have (DDR5 > DDR4), the faster the CPU-side expert computation will be.",

Token generation is one thing, but prompt processing, especially for coding, is even more important for session start (which is especially painful for orchestrating agents when PP is slow).",
