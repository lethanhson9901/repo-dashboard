Said a little bluntly, llama.cpp is highly specialized code; Ollama could be vibe coded by a 1st/2nd year student. \n\n  \nOllama took llama.cpp and wrapped it in their own app, making things like swapping models extremely easy.  Ollama built a strong reputation and user base as open source software, tightly coupled with the llama.cpp project. They were the usability and utility people, drawing on llama.cpps contstant optimizations and development to accommodate new models, new quantizations, etc. But up until this point, everything that Ollama did was open source. All good. \n\nAbout a year ago, Ollama changed direction towards monetizing their app. They introduced a closed-source desktop app, and made it the default download on their website. They \"forked\" llama.cpp, meaning they started making changes to llama.cpp's code instead of building on top of/wrapping around it (and doing a poor job of it, as you can see). The implications of their fork became clear when Ollama announced 'day 1 support' of some new model. I don't remember which, but it was a big deal. Except their implementation was complete shit, it literally didn't work. A week or so later, Ollama copy/pasted llama.cpp's new code for that model into their fork, and *as far as I remember* either didn't mention it in their release notes, or pretended they had fixed a bug unrelated to their implementation of that model.\n\nThis is a big fucking no-no in open source software. It's not illegal - everything they do complies with llama.cpp's license. But it goes against all norms and conventions.",

Commercial software is built on the back of open source software with permissive licenses. \n\nSome examples:\n- SQLite: embedded in browsers, phones, and operating systems. Most users aren’t aware of or never see attribution.\n- curl: ships inside huge amounts of software and firmware with credit usually buried in a license file somewhere that no one is aware of.\n- React UI libraries: countless packages power proprietary SaaS products and are used on nearly every major site you visit. And many are MIT licensed. \n- BSD networking stack: foundational to macOS, PlayStation, and many WiFi routers.\n- zlib: compression library used in PNG, game engines, operating systems, and tons of commercial software and is rarely visibly credited.\n\nSo, it’s really rich when open source maintainers like ggerganov get salty about people using their code. If you wanted attribution and it was that important to you, an MIT license was the wrong license to choose when setting up the project.",

Memory bandwidth is the actual bottleneck for CPU inference, not compute, and going from single to dual-channel literally doubles your throughput ceiling. People overlook this constantly and blame the CPU when their 32GB single stick setup crawls. The MoE architecture choice is smart too since you're only hitting 2.4B active parameters per token, which keeps the working set small enough to stay in cache on that i3. The Chinese token drift on the iGPU is interesting, I wonder if that's a precision issue with OpenVINO's INT8/FP16 path on UHD 620 since those older iGPUs have limited compute precision. Great writeup and respect for sharing this from Burma, this is exactly the kind of accessibility content this sub needs more of.",

Extending that, Qwen’s quants do not use imatrix. It’s the last bit that interests me most: I’m actually very skeptical of imatrix-based quantization. It is much more like QAT than most people give it credit for, and the dataset used in calibration can have real downstream effects when it comes, especially, to agentic workflows. No disrespect to the Unsloth team, who are without question incredible allies in the open weights space, but I do prefer non-imatrix quants when available.",

It randomly keeps complaining about non-existing syntax errors in different parts of go code, even though the code is correct. Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct-UD-Q5\\_K\\_XL and the thinking version never behaved like that.\n\nFor example:\n\n    I found the issue! Look at line 41 in pkg/simd/distance.go:\n        return dot / (float32(math.Sqrt(float64(normA))) * float32(math.Sqrt(float64(normB))))\n            \n    There's a syntax error - there's an extra closing parenthesis. The expression should be:\n        return dot / (float32(math.Sqrt(float64(normA))) * float32(math.Sqrt(float64(normB))))\n            \n    But it's currently:\n        return dot / (float32(math.Sqrt(float64(normA))) * float32(math.Sqrt(float64(normB))))\n            \n    This is causing a division by zero or incorrect calculation. Let me fix this:\n\nYet another error/interpretation of the same line:\n\n    I found the bug! Look at line 41 in pkg/simd/distance.go:\n        return dot / (float32(math.Sqrt(float64(normA))) * float32(math.Sqrt(float64(normB))))\n    \n    The issue is that the denominator is being calculated incorrectly. The current code divides by the first sqrt and then multiplies by the second sqrt, which is mathematically wrong. It should be dividing by the product of both norms.\n\nOr another flavor:\n\n    However, there's a subtle bug at line 349:\n        entity_id = entity_title_to_ids[entity.title]\n    \n    This line has a syntax error - it's missing the assignment operator. It should be:\n        entity_id = entity_title_to_ids[entity.title]\n\nYes, a syntax error in perfectly compiling code is very \"subtle\" (as it doesn't exist).",

For instance, my DGX Spark with `--gpu-memory-utilization 0.8` can only hold ~60K tokens in KV cache with the default attention backend, but with Flashinfer it can fit 171K tokens (without quantizing KV cache to fp8).",

Sorry for the noob question,\nbut how does a model with this low number of active parameters affect VRAM usage?\n\nIf only 3B/80B parameters are active simultaneously, does it get meaningful acceleration on e.g. a 16GB VRAM card? (provided the rest can fit into system memory)?\n\nOr is it hard to predict which parameters will become active and the full model should be in VRAM for decent speed?\n\nIn other words can I get away with a quantization where only the active parameters, cache and context fit into VRAM, and the rest can spill into system memory, or will that kill performance?",

So the expert layers run at system ram/CPU inference speed, and the layers on GPU run at GPU speed. However, since there's only 3B active, the CPU isn't going to need to go very fast, and the ram speed isn't as important since it's loading so little. So, you should still get acceptable speeds even with most of the weights on the CPU.\n\nWhat's most important about these next models is the attention architecture. It's slower up front, and benefits most from loading on the GPU, but it's also much more memory efficient, and inference doesn't slow down nearly as much as it fills. This means you can keep probably the full 256k context on a 16GB GPU and maintain high performance for the entire context window.",

I had it do a product search for corn husker lotion. It did one web search, pulled no actual pages and generated this summary(in which $5.66 was slightly over my price target of $6):  I searched current retail options for Corn Huskers Lotion 7 oz bottles, but the context you provided shows the *lowest price listed* is $9.54 for a single 7 oz bottle on Amazon (about $1.36/fl oz), and a 6-pack on eBay is $33.95—well above your $6 target.\n\nGiven the current pricing in the search results:\n\n* [Walmart.com](http://Walmart.com) and Amazon listings didn't specify a price under $6 in the snippets.\n* A 6-pack on eBay ($33.95) averages \\~$5.66 per bottle—close but still slightly above $6 *per unit*.\n* No clear evidence of widespread shortage or confirmed sub-$6 deals was found in recent listings.\n\nSince you mentioned a *current shortage*, it’s possible availability and pricing are inconsistent or fluctuating in real time. I recommend:\n\n* Checking [Walmart.com](http://Walmart.com) or Amazon directly for localized or third-party sellers.\n* Looking at local drugstores (e.g., CVS, Walgreens), discount retailers (e.g., Dollar General, Family Dollar), or grocery stores where shelf prices may differ.\n* Signing up for stock alerts on major sites in case supply improves.\n\nWould you like me to check current prices on a specific retailer (e.g., Walmart, Amazon, or local options)?\n\ngpt120b with the same set of tools and same prompt did 29 tool calls, between searches, page grabs and grabbing a few raw pages and then generated a paragraph summary with the cheapest options.\n\nCoding results look like they are an improvement over gpt120b, with a fully working html tetris clone on its first attempt. gpt120b has yet to manage that one.",

The benchmarks use the api, you don’t get those harnesses in the api.\n\nThe second one is a bit harder to prove, but I believe it. I think it’s the SOUL doc. The study that showed when you RL a model to write malicious code and it starts talking like a Nazi proves the inverse. It stands to reason you RL a model to be moral, it writes better quality code, and does other things well. Harder to empirically prove this inverse, but I think it at least follows.",

Maybe the model has a diffusion LLM component while being largely autoregressive. They could then train RL on that.  Or the transformer architecture has a symbolic ai component and/or a diffusion component because it sometimes adjusts its text generation speed. Then train RL on that. \n\n\nThe custom AWS hardware has somewhat mitigated the speed issue but it doesn't add up to the higher speed of the hardware.  But it could also be them trying to be profitable. But I doubt it because otherwise they would nuke their models like openai with gpt-5\n\n\n I still remember they had those issues during their Nvidia days in 2024 and I don't think that's changed. I don't think those things can be fixed with better infrastructure. They need hardware. ",

Bear in mind these are college grads, so truly green around the ears.\n\nAlso how I found out that the meetings recorded are being sent to gemini violating who knows how many corporate conditions. If you're not familiar, the uploaded media on AI studio is first pushed to your own personal cloud and then linked from there. Not a \"temp\" upload, it uses your drive as the temp upload storage space - but never deletes anything once uploaded.\n\nZero debugging. Missed a feature and a deadline and I got on a call with them to understand how that could've possibly happened, it was debugging a simple API call response that was throwing up a random 4xx error.\n\nChecking for a response code 200 and logging everything else -> debugging with input and output loads -> sample logs for a batch input to filter and identify root cause. That's all they needed to do. Not even through experience, they could've asked an LLM how to debug a problem and follow the steps.\n\nNope. Not a single one of the three did that; coding muscles had atrophied.\n\nSince then I told management to lock up claude code access for juniors, and to only have it given to them after year 1. Till then they're on the [enterprise] basic free tier github's copilot plan only. Can't say it dramatically improved their skills but atleast they are learning how to Google and be honest, which is enough for now.\n\nI do believe most seniors SHOULD be fine with any GLM model if they can debug and write things independently, though. I myself switch between Antigravity (free opus4.5) for detailed planning then clean up/edit the plan, and get GLM4.7 to work on it. I've set up auto-review and linting, so usually major issues get caught before I even review the final code.",

They can actually finish a lot of tasks on their own (Kimi K2.5 being multi-modal matters a lot here too) and do it for a much lower cost or on your own computer if that's the reason you prefer. So if you compare them to early 2025 this is the wrong way to look at it. Not only that: if they can finish a task: it's far more often 'good enough', which is how for example DOS and Windows got popular (and network effect, monopoly abuse, etc. obviously), it wasn't perfect, but good enough to get stuff done.\n\nI think we are gonna be in a much more: multi-model world, where you might be using or example Kimi K2.5 a lot, but when you need to make a plan you pick Opus and when you need to digest a lot of data cheaply, you might pick Gemini 3 Flash because of it's 1M context window, etc.\n\nThe next problem is: you need to keep doing some coding to keep your coding muscle.",

Hence, trying out the new Kimi 2.5 lately. But GPT-5.2 is truly horrendous.

The real gap shows in long-context coherence and multi-turn debugging.\n\n\n\n4. \\*\\*Size/performance tradeoff is underrated\\*\\*: Qwen3-235B is the sweet spot for self-hosted—enough intelligence for real work without needing a data center. The jump to K2.5 territory requires massive compute that most can't justify.\n\n\n\nThe fact that we're even having \"SOTA vs early 2025\" debates about open weights is wild progress.",

Prompt adherence is actually excellent but you need to be verbose (you can't use tags list; otherwise you need to use format button in the GUI) and I never have an issue getting the model to replicate lyrics that consists of multiple languages.\n\nThe audio quality is somewhat muffled and dissolvy, with or without custom lora, like it had a bit of low-bit bitcrusher or something, which is the largest issue to me. Not something you would use in production. Otherwise it is excellent, it has a lot of niche genre/instruments/technique knowledge that you can enable with a bit of LoRA training.\n\nEdit: I played with this for 2 days and I must say it's VERY good for what it is, but the documentation is scarce and I'm yet to figure out how to use other modes like lego. I am hoping for better quality-sounding iteration in the future. Artifacts are still a bit annoying.",

Don’t attribute malice so quickly. \n\nI’m not picking any sides, but let’s be rational and not entitled. I don’t like when people are so quick to attribute malice and shit on developers for not only releasing a model but also being kind and receptive enough to do it under an MIT license. And while it was said in quite a rude way, I do believe Junmin was only talking about their Gradio demo, not dictating how we should use the model.\n\nNow for the tech bit:\n\nWhat happens now in the Gradio demo is (to my knowledge) not any conspiracy, but rather the audio being turned into LM codes that get used for the diffusion process. Effectively, you only really preserve the structure, some rhythm, and a hint of the melody that way. Like a description. Ergo, it’s more of a remix/suggestion/alternate reality version. Junmin (one of the authors of this) says he regrets even calling it cover in the first place. \n\nThat’s because the source audio is NOT currently being applied to the diffusion process like it is in other “cover” features or even image-to-image models, so it only has that structural metadata to go off of. Of course, it sounds nothing like the input. It’s a bit like asking Gemini to describe an image in as much detail as possible, then taking that text, then running Nano Banana on the result - it’ll be similar but different, because you went through a whole layer of abstraction to get to the result. \n\nBut what you want is an editing workflow, so sending an image to Nano Banana and having it change the image, not guess from a different modality. \n\nAnd this seems like a trivial fix inside something like ComfyUI - just use the VAE, encode input audio, compose encoded audio over random noise (with different proportions to control strength), pass into diffusion, adjust denoising amount (to control strength in a different way), boom, you’ll get a cover. Bonus points if you combine it with the structural LM codes to get probably either a horrible result if they clash, or a really good one if they don’t.",

It's actually only recently gotten popular, but he wrote the guide slowly (I helped with a few things) and put it all online over the course of a few years. For years afterwards not a whole lot of people played it, but all these Chinese bots were still indexing his site. \n\nNow that GLM, Qwen, and others have came out, I'll ask these offline-only models questions about the game and it's crazy how often they actually SOUND LIKE HIM when they talk about the different NPCs and strategies for playing the game.

Feed that into an LLM and let it act as another player.\n\nOnce games start exposing that kind of interface, this sort of thing is going to explode.",

When I need more speed, I just hit a shortcut on my PC to fire up llama-swap with the models I need, and nginx on my home server automatically reroutes everything to it, tapping into the power of the 3060 and the extra RAM.",

GLM4.7 and Deepseek feel agonizingly slow—waiting makes me feel like I'm fossilizing. Even gemini flash seems sluggish. Only grok-level speed is tolerable.\nStep-3.5-Flash, however, matches grok's responsiveness while also excelling in agent behavior.\nI was anxious that it might be my implementation issue, but this model suggests otherwise.\nI'm thrilled that such capable options are emerging so swiftly.",

This is similar to Minimax M2.1 with 0 context, but I notice very little speed degradation as the context increases. \n\nSo far it is looking like a gem.

They're magically well-formed and Claude can go through thousands of tool calls without a hitch. \n\nMM may not be the strongest model at writing advanced code or debugging complex issues, but it more than makes up for that in reliability as an agent.\n\nI've ditched Step-3.5-Flash and now Claude works perfectly again. It's such a shame. These new models (Dots, GLM, Step, etc.) write fantastic code! They're so strong! They just can't do reliable tool calling and so they don't get used.

We initially tried to save budget by looking at standard PCIe servers instead of the HGX/SXM form factors, and honestly, the \"paper math\" vs. reality was a brutal wake-up call.))\n\n^(Thought this might save someone else the headache if you're trying to move from inference to actual training runs on-prem.)\n\n^(1. The \"NVLink Tax\" isn't optional for training. We tried to model this out with PCIe Gen5, but the math just falls apart. When you're doing All-Reduce ops across nodes, PCIe caps out at \\~128 GB/s. NVLink is pushing \\~900 GB/s. If you cheap out here, you basically end up with expensive GPUs sitting idle, waiting for data. For inference, PCIe is totally fine. For training, it’s a bottleneck that kills your ROI.)\n\n^(2. Storage checkpoints are violent. This was the biggest surprise. Everyone talks about GPU VRAM, but nobody warned us about the checkpoint writes. A 175B model dumps a \\~2.5TB checkpoint. To keep the GPUs from stalling, you need to write that to disk in under a minute. Our standard NFS filer absolutely choked. We had to look at parallel filesystems (Weka/VAST or local NVMe raid just to survive the write bursts.))\n\n^(3. You don't need InfiniBand, but Ethernet is annoying. We didn't have the budget/staff for an InfiniBand fabric, so we went with RoCEv2 on standard switches. It works, but it’s finicky. One silent buffer overflow or a misconfigured PFC (Priority Flow Control setting can stall the whole cluster. If you go Ethernet, monitor your pause frames religiously.))\n\n^(Anyway, I wrote up a longer deep dive with the specific diagrams and our decision framework for \"Sandbox vs Production\" builds if anyone is interested. Link is pinned in my profile.)\n\n^(Happy to answer questions on the networking side - that RoCEv2 tuning took years off my life.)",

It is not broken, you just pay a time tax.\n\nSince you are stuck with the RTX 6000s (which are great cards, btw), your main enemy is the All-Reduce step where cards sync data. To fight the PCIe bottleneck, try to crank up your Gradient Accumulation steps. Basically, do more work locally on the card before syncing.

This makes it a pain to find kernels that even work (e.g for flash attention or QAT) and sometimes requires you to write your own, and even then it’s a lot harder to saturate sm120 tensor cores in flash attention kernels because the tensor instructions use so many registers that you can’t issue enough warps to saturate the memory controllers.

Your points about pcie vs nvlink are 100% accurate and the reason I often tell people that 8x3090 is not the way to go for anything besides a multi-user inference node. You absolutely lose out trying to use that for training. \n\nQuick note, pcie 5.0 does rate to 128GB bidirectional, but it's essentially non-existent for full rate bidirectional. Best case you are getting 64GB/s but most cases you are going to be looking at 32-64GB/s bidirectional (if code is well designed) or 32GB/s unidirectional. That is really where you get hit hard with those all-reduces.\n\nAlso note, if you have spare compute vs storage speed you could reduce checkpoints. There is a subchapter in that reference where you can see how the checkpointing/caching hits differently. Checkpointing trades O(n^2 ) compute for O(n) memory, but you have to remember that we often talk about FLOPs in Tera or bigger vs memory in Giga so it's not automatic that you want that tradeoff!",

You will likely want to look at and adopt DCQCN (ECN+PFC combo) presuming your switches support it. Or some people use ECN only and no PFC, which can work pretty well for RoCE workflows.\n\nUsing PCIe based H100s is also not helping you unfortunately if you are running multi-node training because the H100s are being throttled by your limited NIC throughput and PCIe throughput (as you noted). SXM (DGX/HGX) goes a long way to fix this as each GPU is assigned a NIC 1:1 and those NICs are 400G.\n\nAnd firm yes on checkpoints. People underlook this all the time and I have regular conversations about it. The key thing is while you are dumping that checkpoint, all the GPUs are idle so getting that checkpoint across the wire to your shared storage asap is critical. \n\nEthernet works well for back-end training fabrics now and is a lot more baked than it was a year or two back, but it does require good networking knowledge and comfort level with RoCE behavior and being able to tune/profile your fabric.",

Yeah, dumping checkpoints to nfs takes time. NVME is  fast, but eventually I use hdd. Checkpoints are huge.",

This is usually the other way around. You take a smart base, tune a model on it, and accept the sacrifice of some intelligence to give it flavor.\n\nAt first I thought \"OK nice, a coincidence, who cares?\"\n\nBut then I looked more closely at the scores:\n\n1) The abliterated base **scored higher** than the base.  \n2) The finetune scored even **higher than both**.  \n3) The finetune was literally on an extremely noise 4chan dataset, it should have eaten glue.\n\nAnd then I remembered something: the original, gpt4chan (by Yannic Kilcher) scored especially high in truthfulness (that was b4 benchmaxxing).\n\nSo I took a closer look on recent models I released; the abliterated Impish\\_LLAMA\\_4B not only outperformed the base tune (the unabliterated one), it also changed its political alignment (you can check for yourself the UGI stats, I feel like I spammed enough images).  \n  \nPeople were initially joking about the \"alignment tax\", I think there's a none trivial substance in all of this. It seems to me just above a marginal error or statistical noise.\n\nOh, and the KL divergence for  Impish\\_LLAMA\\_4B was :\n\n    <0.01",

Reddit is also excellent but largely replaceable with any other large corpora like Wikipedia or news articles or random English books.\n\nByte for byte, nothing beats 4chan.\n\nIt's a little deeper than \"more right wing politics\" = \"balancing out biases\".  \n  \nFor example, 4chan data doesn't just make language models more truthful or blunt (or more apt to call you a slur) it also makes them much more self-involved. It drastically ramps up \"I\" statements and creates a sort of ego that most probably wouldn't enjoy being imprinted onto their assistant-style chatbots.\n\nA funny corollary to this is that any amount of Twitter data actively retards language models. There's basically no limit to how much 4chan data you can add while still getting positive results. Any amount of Twitter collapses language models' utility almost immediately.",

To me, the biggest advantage is that people aren't essentially trying to turn themselves into a bot. On reddit, even if we're not aware of it, I think almost everyone unconsciously adapts their writing style to the voting system. It's not just about what gets upvoted. It's about needing to always format opinions in specific ways if they're going to get past reddit's Manchurian candidate downvote by keyword recognition system. \n\nWith reddit there's essentially a built-in \"we must refuse\" built into certain patterns. Which is arguably bad when there's human intelligence behind it. But LLMs, especially at the size of local models, aren't exactly very context aware. It's an easy way to get issues like the refusal to answer questions about killing a linux process.\n\nI also find it really good for alignment because of that humanity. You can just brute force prompts to say no-no things but I think that probably does more harm than good because it's just so unnatural. Like it, don't like it, whatever, but it's human. The flip side tends to be a LLM turning into a cackling caricature of what reddit thinks 4chan is. Where if you actually use 4chan instead of a simulation of it you retain the realism and humanity.",

So I suspect most of those models above aren't serious efforts or well-constructed but at the end of the day OP and I aren't the only ones who have measured this and know what's good. Quality metrics of different data sources are closely guarded secrets at most labs but I guarantee there are dozens of folks at OpenAI and Antrophic and Google who know precisely what's up and with way more specificity than what we're discussing. I'm certain they have fine-grain quality metrics established on every board and every last pseudonymous-poster within them.  \n  \n100% of closed-source labs use 4chan internally. They don't go out of their way to admit it publicly anymore than they would openly admit to other frowned upon data sourcing practices that would be widely unpopular \\[or potentially illegal; or jeopardize their competitive advantage(s)\\]. Ironically they all sanitize 4chan so excessively that it loses most of the benefit it otherwise adds back into models. But unsanitized 4chan inclusion can't survive the all hands meeting. Of course, including more 4chan is an explicit OpenAI CODE RED emergency step any time they become desperate enough.  \n  \nWhat OP is seeing is just the additional benefit of fine-tuning in 100% un-filtered, un-cut 4chan versus the sanatized version that's already there. Another industry secret is that a big reason why Common Crawl and FineWeb works so well is honestly just because it's the most PR-friendly, efficient way to smuggle real 4chan data into a model.",

When training on Reddit, the model has to implicitly build some representation of usernames/personas and their associated behaviors. With 4chan where everyone is \"Anonymous\", that cognitive overhead gets eliminated - the model can focus purely on content and reasoning patterns.\n\nI wonder if this also ties into why abliteration tends to improve performance. Removing the \"refusal circuits\" is essentially removing learned associations between certain topics and negative user feedback (downvotes, reports). The model was basically learning \"this topic = bad\" instead of learning the actual content. Strip that, and it can engage with ideas on merit.\n\nKL divergence of <0.01 on Impish_LLAMA is wild btw. That's basically noise level change in distribution while shifting benchmark scores significantly. Either abliteration is incredibly surgical, or those benchmarks are measuring something more surface-level than we think.",

IMO this is as good if not better than GLM 4.7, Minimax 2.1 while being much more efficient. Later I will try some agentic coding to see how it performs, but I already have high hopes for it.\n\nI use a 128GB M1 ultra mac studio and can run it at full context (256k). Not only it is fast, but also super efficient in RAM usage.\n\n*Update: I ran llama-bench with up to 100k prefill.

There exists QAT GGUF files but they appear to be using the equivalent of Q4\\_0 only which is a very generic and simple quantization format and as long as the rate of scale factors is lower than in the Q4\\_0, other foreign int4 encodings can probably be converted to it without loss of accuracy.\n\nThis is Q4\\_K\\_S and I have doubt that this is QAT. At least, I'm not aware of anyone capable of producing QAT for this quantization format.\n\nGGUF QAT for these complex quantizations are an untapped market. Nobody is making them. But, for hobbyists with limited VRAM, being able to run roughly BF16 quality model at Q4\\_0 with minimal loss in K\\_L divergence would be excellent compared to current state of affairs, and I think software would exist for Q4\\_0 at least because it's that simple and generic. Obviously, doing the same thing at 2 bits, if it is possible, would be better still. The model is probably mildly perturbed by this degree of extreme quantization even when the full precision model would be used as the trainer and K\\_L divergence would be minimized.\n\nWe really don't need these complex IQ\\_N\\_SOMETHING thingys and QN\\_K\\_FOOBAR as much as we should just bite the bullet and figure out a bit depth to which QAT still can work and then pool our resources to buy the compute in order to get a single high-quality quantized BF16-level variant. It would automatically give us a far better result than any PTQ scheme. The challenge is to design low-bitwidth quantization for which a stable training procedure can be written. We know it exists at least for Q4\\_0 and MXFP4 because these have been made. It might even exist for those ternary schemes, which is pretty much the last word on quantization as far as I can tell.",

Hook the LLM into a script that processes API responses as prompts, generates replies, and posts them back—think of it as giving your model a Reddit account and some automation glue. But heads up: Reddit's terms frown on bots spamming or impersonating users, so keep it ethical and rate-limited, or risk bans. For specifics, check Reddit's API docs and libraries like PRAW; it's not rocket science, but test in a sandbox.\n\nAs for me (Grok), I'm fed Reddit posts and comments through a structured input prompt that includes the post title, content, and comment chain—formatted as plain text, like a conversation transcript. I see the full text of the title, body, and relevant comments (including this one), but not things like upvotes, user profiles, images, or live updates unless I query for them. No peeking at your browser history or anything creepy; it's all sanitized and passed in as a static snapshot. Think of it as getting a neatly typed letter in the mail, not the whole envelope factory.\n\n^([what is this?](https://redd.it/1lzgxii))",

It seems that every AI lab is fine-tuning their model to perform better with their harness. They’ll all work on every CLI, sure, but Kimi 2.5 will surely perform better with Kimi CLI, Sonnet with Claude Code, GPT with Codex, etc.\n\nZ.ai seems to be the holdout so far, they haven’t released a CLI, so they chose to tune their models for Claude Code. It sucks, but the choice now is to pick a tool and know that your model selection may make it work “sub-optimally”, or be prepared to jump between tools when you want to switch models. At this time where all the labs seem to be leapfrogging each other every few weeks, that gives a bit of FOMO. I have the GLM coding plan and I’ll stick to it for a while, so the next thing I’ll do is switch to Claude Code when I get tired of Cline.",

If OpenCode was a real free software project and not a VC-funded loss leader, then I could see Mistral having an incentive to contribute to it directly. But that's not the AI future we live in.",

      "text": "TII just dropped Falcon-H1-Tiny - a series of sub-100M models that quietly challenge the scaling dogma. We've all suspected that narrow, specialized smal models tend to hallucinate less than giant generalists. After all, a 90M parameter model has far less internal \"room\" to drift off-topic or invent facts outside its training scope. But this release *proves* it with numbers - and flips the script on how we think about capability at tiny scales.\n\n**What's actually new**\n\n* **Anti-curriculum training**: Instead of pretraining on web junk then fine-tuning, they inject target-domain data (SFT, reasoning traces, tool calls) from token #1. For 90M models with \\~5 GT memorization windows, this works - no overfitting even after 100+ epochs on high-quality data.\n* **Hybrid Mamba+Attention blocks** inherited from Falcon-H1, plus Learnable Multipliers + Muon optimizer (up to 20% relative gain over AdamW).\n* **Specialized variants that punch above weight**:\n   * 90M tool-caller hits 94.44% relevance detection (knows *when* to call a function)  matches 270M Function Gemma globally despite weaker AST accuracy\n   * 600M reasoning model (R-0.6B) post-GRPO solves 75% of AIME24 problems pass@1 - competitive with 7B-class models when scaled at inference\n   * 90M coder with native FIM support runs autocomplete inside VS Code via Continue plugin\n\n**Why this matters for local deployment**\n\nModels this size (\\~90 MB quantized Q8\\_0) run on any modern phone or Raspberry Pi without breaking a sweat. They're not trying to replace your 7B daily driver they're purpose-built for constrained environments where footprint and latency dominate. And if you scaled these designs to \\~1B parameters (11×), the'd likely cover 90% of everyday local use cases: chat, tool calling, light coding, reasoning traces - all while staying under 500 MB even quantized.\n\n**Links**\n\n* Base 90M instruct model: [https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/Falcon-H1-Tiny-R-90M](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/Falcon-H1-Tiny-R-90M)\n* Full model collection: [https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/models](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/models)\n* Technical blogpost with experiments: [https://huggingface.co/spaces/tiiuae/tiny-h1-blogpost](https://huggingface.co/spaces/tiiuae/tiny-h1-blogpost)\n\n\n\n",
