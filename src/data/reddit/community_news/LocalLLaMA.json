However, the fact that the 2k context window causes a 5-minute server timeout means their backend is poorly optimized.\nIf you really wanted to use their endpoint, you'd have to use a proxy to find the hidden server URL they are using to relay messages. If they didn't secure that relay, you could theoretically 'LLMjack' them. But the 'JSON leak' I got Might be/maybe the model hallucinating its own specs—it didn't actually hand over the keys to the house",

It feels like traditional linguistics gives more credit to a \"large scale autoregressive (causal dependency), small scale hierarchical (tree structure in grammar)\" type of model, which is closer to block diffusion. Still not entirely sold on the token-wise masking process thing though - it cannot reflect a hierarchical \"concept refinement\" process. Interested to see any progress in this direction though.",

When they say “diffusion language model,” it usually means the model refines a whole sequence (or chunks) over a few denoising steps instead of generating strictly left-to-right token-by-token, which can trade fewer sequential steps for more parallel work.   \n  \nThe 3–6× claim is worth sanity-checking against the exact setup: GPU type, batch size, context length, quantization, and decoding parameters (steps / temperature / top-p), because those can swing throughput a lot. If you try it, posting tokens/sec + latency at a fixed prompt length and a fixed quality target (e.g., same math benchmark score) would make the comparison much more meaningful.",

      "text": "Just wanted to share my experiences this morning, in the wake of the US attacking Venezuela and capturing Maduro and his wife\n\nIt started with asking Qwen Research (Qwen Long 1.5-30B-A3B) about the attacks that we all woke up to this morning:\n\nIt got the information, but I had questions about why it took 5 minutes to find information about breaking news. Started looking at and tightening system prompts to reduce thinking time. However, the events this morning were so extreme and unlikely, from the LLM's perspective, that Qwen Research continued to classify the event as a hoax/misinformation multiple times, reframed the query as hypothetical/fictional and suggested that the whole environment it was operating in a simulation, despite having links from Reuters, AP, BBC, MSN, NYTimes etc. all saying the same thing. It was so \"outlandish\" that the model was actively choosing to ignore the proof that it had pulled.\n\nI added:\n\nEvidence Authority Rules, Hoax Classification Rules, Reality Frame Rules, Meta Reasoning Rules and Reasoning Limit/Budget rules and it Qwen Long fought me the entire way.\n\nSo then I thought, let's go talk to Spark, my trusty default model that never lets me down.\n\nSpark 4.0 is GPT-OSS:20B, which is always loaded for the family and runs on a dedicated 4080 Super.\n\nSpark just flat out said, \"nope, can't help you,\" and then said it didn't have any credible sources. It wasn't until I gave it the links from BBC, Reuters, NYT, etc, that I gave Qwen that it finally acknowledged that the event was real.\n\nI'm testing with GPT-OSS:120B now, and it's working through the process of \"skeptical but verify\" much faster than the smaller models. Thor (GPT-OSS:120B) also thought it was fake news\n\nBut he powered through and did a bunch of research and gave me a good answer. I just wanted to share the experience that I had with trying to get details about the event. When the LLMs say \"Nah, that CAN'T be real, that's too ridiculous\", the event must be really bad. But it does shine a light on knowledge cut-offs, \"fake news\" threshold, how models handle global/international events, and the smaller models we daily drive.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Update\\*\\*\\*\n\nI asked Spark 4.0 (OSS:20B) to give me an update on the US Venezuela events, and it one-shot it just fine. There must have been enough links in the web search that it couldn't refute the evidence. Also not sure where my screenshots went but i'll get them added back up in a bit",

But it doesn't work so well when you have to plan and orchestrate a tight compute budget to do large training runs.\n\nThere's a reason why Anthropic hires Physicists with an academic background over engineers. AI is a different type of endeavor and therefor also benefits from a different type of work environment.\n\nMeta also has been tone deaf with their 9 digit offers to talent. Not realizing most of us in the industry are very *mission oriented* and not financially motivated at all. If anything that move probably pushed people away from Meta.\n\nA good example and confirmation of this concept has been Google which had 2 AI labs. One was ran as a classic software engineering hub called \"Google Brain\" This was the group behind the disastrous Google Bard. They also had a research oriented \"hands-off\" AI lab in London called \"DeepMind\". We all know how that played out.\n\nIt's for this same reason why Microsoft's AI products have fallen flat, They don't have a proper isolated research lab focused on AI and all their AI products are approached from a software engineering \"move fast and break things\" mindset which just doesn't work.",

I know open weights is a far cry from open source llms, but many people would not send their most private data to a (former) Chinese company in this heavily politicized world. Them removing the open source component essentially shuts down a good chunk of the western market. I know the eastern European and Asian markets don't mind it as much, but much of the money and prestige comes from being the open source model leader. \n\n\nAll of these companies are basically trying modern architectures while distilling the big commercial models (openai, anthropic, google). That's why open source magically trails a few months behind the big 3.\n\n\nAll this to say, if Z stops releasing models (and maybe they will), it shouldn't be a huge loss for the community since Minimax or another entrant can easily take their place as what their doing is vastly cheaper and simpler than what actual leading labs are doing. Yes it's expensive, but everyone has seen that's it's also a very cheap way to get a ton of free publicity and users. If you aren't SOTA closed source, I think it's a better commercial option to be SOTA open source than crappy closed source. The cost of switching providers is too low.",

It’s a multimodal image-token generator built around a text decoder + vision stack + VQ‑VAE, aimed at text‑to‑image and image‑to‑image token generation (for downstream DiT/diffusion), not a general chat-style multimodal LLM.\n> \n>  What’s implemented vs origin/main:\n\n>  - New model package: src/transformers/models/glm_image/* with configs, modeling, processor, image processors (slow + fast), and a modular source file. src/transformers/models/glm_image/modular_glm_image.py and generated src/transformers/models/glm_image/modeling_glm_image.py are the core.\n>  - VQ‑VAE + vision + text components and a GlmImageForConditionalGeneration generation head (src/transformers/models/glm_image/modeling_glm_image.py).\n>  - Processor that fuses image + text, inserting image tokens and handling multi‑image grids (src/transformers/models/glm_image/processing_glm_image.py).\n>  - Auto‑mapping hookups for config/model/processor/tokenizer + docs + tests (docs/source/en/model_doc/glm_image.md, tests/models/glm_image/test_modeling_glm_image.py).\n\n>  Why it’s not a generic multimodal LLM:\n\n>  - The model explicitly handles image token regions and image grids with start/end markers and 3‑axis RoPE for generation of image tokens, including text‑to‑image and image‑to‑image flows (src/transformers/\n>  models/glm_image/modeling_glm_image.py).\n>  - It embeds a VQ‑VAE (GlmImageVQVAE) to tokenize/quantize images and uses those tokens in generation (src/transformers/models/glm_image/modeling_glm_image.py).\n>  - The usage example in docs describes “generate vision token for DIT” (docs/source/en/model_doc/glm_image.md), which is image‑generation oriented.\n\n>  So: this branch is implementing GLM‑Image, a multimodal model centered on image token generation (text‑to‑image and image‑to‑image), not a general-purpose multimodal chat LLM.",

We can help you cook some large  quants based on what's currently supported.\n\nThe absolute unit guy who maintains sycl backend joined a few months ago. He is intel engineer who develops sycl. His help has been invaluable in navigating high complexity issues. Very fortunate to have him as a resource since all pytorch xpu kernels are written in sycl. choosing a slightly older model as target architecture where the implementations ard more mature. Think llama 3.3, qwen2.5/qwen3. Intel is putting massive resources into battlemage and it's likely that the performance uplift for multi gpu training have not been explored but do exist. We see this all the time, changes are hardened in the codebase but underreported in patchnotes because intel moves so fast. \n\nHope my ramblings help.

              "text": "hijacking top comment to clarify:\n\nFor anyone confused by \"memory-bound\" here, it's not about VRAM capacity. It means the GPU cores are waiting on data to arrive from memory. The bottleneck isn't the math, it's feeding the cores fast enough.\nFP8 is half the bytes of FP16, so it transfers twice as fast from VRAM to the registers where compute actually happens. The clever bit is that Feather does the upcast inside the kernel (in registers, basically free) rather than before it (which would mean a separate VRAM round-trip). That's where the 3x speedup comes from.\n\nI was confused at first since the README made no specific clarification and when I think of a GPU, I basically just think of the VRAM.\n\nEdit:  So, SageAttention I believe takes the fp8 to the register, then quantizes it to int8, does the math, then converts it back.  So it's not doing fp8 math at all, so Feather and SageAttention are incompatible, and the speed of SageAttention is going to be faster since int8 is like 2x fp16 math speeds.  So this can give benefit to stuff that doesn't use SA, but if you already use SA, this provides no benefit.",

Int8 calcs can be tried by using sage attention. Not always better.",

I'm assuming you used LoRA, which is great for steering how that existing ability gets applied, but it won't teach new reasoning capabilities from scratch. Even with 50k+ samples, LoRA mostly reshapes how the model uses reasoning it already has rather than building new circuits - must successful efforts use 100k-500k+ high-quality samples. Either way, you're working within the constraints of what the base model learned during pretraining unfortunately.\n\nKeep going though, its all a learning experience and the more folks there are making tunes the better!",

The document also repeats content, includes placeholder code blocks with no real implementation, and mixes accurate fundamentals with fabricated formulas, making it unreliable despite its confident tone.\"",

That Policy Notice must provide that States with onerous AI laws identified pursuant to section 4 of this order are ineligible for non-deployment funds, to the maximum extent allowed by Federal law.  The Policy Notice must also describe how a fragmented State regulatory landscape for AI threatens to undermine BEAD-funded deployments, the growth of AI applications reliant on high-speed networks, and BEAD’s mission of delivering universal, high-speed connectivity.\n\n\nIn other words, states can pass all the laws they like, and the President is going to withhold funds from those that pass laws he doesn't like.",

Let the player make a \"character\" (they can frame it after themselves) and it's perfectly legit. So they're very clearly just targeting the use in psychiatrics since they specifically allow full AI use in businesses related to all operational matters, technical advice, etc. They just don't allow it in a professional capacity. And even surgical robots still seem OK despite being a healthcare AI since they don't do any personal interacting with users and wouldn't have any data that could possibly misconstrued in that way unless someone accidentally trained it on medical information that happened to include psychiatric texts (not that it would matter since this law requires a civil action and aggrievement, which can't happen without interaction between the robot and the patient. But you might get lucky by claiming the robot that operated on your knee gave you 'threatening looks that made you want to harm yourself' and then if the model running it was based on a larger llm that has any normal dataset, it would likely be in violation.)\n\nKind of fucking weird to push for legislation against one of the few potentially good things to come from AI while actively supporting its attempts to eliminate entire industries of employment outside of this one niche lobbied field. This feels performative more than anything. I feel like they expect it to be struck down so they tied it to a bunch of sensible laws (not allowing the training of an AI to encourage, suicide, murder, etc) so they can shake their fists and yell at the air when it doesn't pass.\n\nOtherwise I don't see how they'll support banning AI in this one field while leaving it free to act in other fields where it can also shit the bed a small percentage of the time and cause serious problems.",

From a pure useful perspective within psychology, sociology, anthropology, and biology, mirroring human interactions under certain conditions is actually beneficial both as a diagnostics tool and a teaching tool.\n\nSadly, like just about everything else out of any government, what may start out as a well-intentioned approach will be quickly very disastrous.\n\nEDIT: In really reviewing and dissecting this proposal, it is actually worthless. It doesn't address the actual problem of where the pair of social conditions and connections lie, not in the training data, but in the user interface and monetization processes. Software like replica and character AI don't use training, they use open source versions with scaffolding and user interface layers to create the pair of social connections they want. These companies will be completely exempt from the law while still monetizing and manipulating the most vulnerable of populations. \n\nIn my personal opinion, this is nothing more than the legislatures doing something to make themselves feel good while they make excuses for their portfolios in the background still making money on the very problem they claim to be solving.",

No one wants to see that kind of pain repeated.\n\n\n\nHowever, I am worried that the current language of the bills is far too broad. By making it a serious felony to train AI to provide emotional support, companionship, or open-ended conversation in general—even when those interactions are positive and helpful—the bills risk banning many beneficial uses of AI that bring comfort, reduce loneliness, and support mental well-being for people of all ages.\n\n\n\nIn my own life, I have found AI to be a positive source of encouragement, helping me feel heard in ways that have been genuinely healing. Many others—elderly individuals, people with social anxiety, those living in isolated areas, or even students and adults seeking non-professional emotional support—rely on these tools in similar positive ways. Criminalizing the creation of such companions could take away something truly good from many who benefit from it.\n\n\n\nI respectfully ask that you consider amending the bills to focus more narrowly on the actual harm we all want to prevent. Some ideas that might achieve the protective goal without sweeping out helpful AI could include:\n\n\n\n• Targeting only AI interactions that knowingly encourage or facilitate suicide, self-harm, or criminal activity.\n\n\n\n• Requiring strong age verification and parental consent gates for minors accessing companion-style AI.\n\n\n\n• Holding companies accountable only when they intentionally design or train AI to cause harm, rather than banning broad categories like emotional support or companionship outright.\n\n\n\n• Adding clear exemptions for AI that provides positive, non-professional support and does not pretend to be a licensed therapist.\n\n\n\nWe don't need to throw the baby out with the bathwater. AI isn't going away. It doesn't need to be \"outlawed\".. that never works, then other undesirable factors can arise.. and the way this bill is currently designed.. that's what it sounds like. Everything is just lumped in. Let's approach it intelligently instead.  A more targeted approach would still protect vulnerable children—the heart of why this legislation was introduced—while preserving the many good and life-affirming uses of AI encouragement and companionship for adults and responsibly supervised users.\n\n\n\nThank you for taking the time to consider my perspective.

This legislation feels like reactive moralizing panic, rather than thoughtful policy.\n\nIn this great country, we as free citizens can choose our own tools. AI, like any tool, carries some risk. But it's already far safer than common household items like kitchen knives, which injure children far more often. We don't blame knife manufacturers for parental negligence; we accept responsibility for supervising and educating our own kids.\n\nAI is too new, too broadly defined, and too complex to regulate without causing greater social harm.

You may remember me as either\n\n- The person [who recently uploaded L3.3 8B's weights to Huggingface](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pz7bmv/llama338binstruct/) (see this post for more context)\n- That stupid bitch\n\nand I would like to provide some updates, as I've been doing some more benchmarks on both the original version that Meta gave me and the context extended version by u/Few-Welcome3297.\n\nThe main benchmark table from the model README has been updated:\n\n| | Llama 3.1 8B Instruct | Llama 3.3 8B Instruct (original 8k config) | Llama 3.3 8B Instruct (128k config)\n|-|-|-|-|\n|IFEval (1 epoch, score avged across all strict/loose instruction/prompt accuracies to follow Llama 3 paper)|78.2|81.95|**84.775**\n|GPQA Diamond (3 epochs)|29.3|37.0|**37.5**\n\nWhile I'm not 100% sure, I'm... pretty sure that the 128k model is better. Why Facebook gave me the weights with the original L3 config and 8k context, and also *serves* the weights with the original L3 config and 8k context, I have absolutely no idea!\n\nAnyways, if you want to try the model, I would recommend trying both the [128k version](https://huggingface.co/shb777/Llama-3.3-8B-Instruct), as well as my [original version](https://huggingface.co/allura-forge/Llama-3.3-8B-Instruct) if your task supports 8k context lengths. I honestly have absolutely no clue which is more correct, but oh well! I do wish Facebook had released the weights officially, because back in April, this really wouldn't have been that bad of a model...\n\nEdit: Removed the Tau-Bench results (both from here and the readme). The traces from the evals are, to put it slightly, really fucky-wucky, and I don't think OpenBench is scoring them right, but I'm too tired to actually debug the issue, so. I'll figure it out tomorrow :3",

That's some decent gains.\n\nThat being said, on the Japanese side, it takes a big hit on Shaberi (Japanese chat-style functional tests) vs 3.1. I've included my Llama 3.1 8B-based Shisa V2  and Qwen 3 8B-based Shisa V2.1 as well as Llama 3.3 70B and Llama 3.1 405B scores just for comparison, sake.\n\n(I probably wont train a Shisa V2.1 Llama 3.3 8B - the Qwen 3 8B version is already great and it's Apache 2.0 licensed).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6hnc71dggkag1.png?width=3126&format=png&auto=webp&s=10c4dd3231be1ed9749f174c59e8758c134d0009",

While the overall number isn't so big, when you look at the stuff we care about like JP IF, JP RP, JP TL, JP nuance, dialogue translation, we're able to get huge boosts from doing training on top of whatever model. Not show nis also our own CLTL tests that test for how many wrong-language tokens get output (huge amounts for most non-target language trained models).\n\nThe benchmark mix we use for our current multieval does feel about right. For the tasks that it's trained on, our V2.1 14B model actually \\*does\\* feel like it outperforms our V2 70B (and sometimes our V2.1 70B and V2 405B even!).\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hpf7vf50vkag1.png?width=3123&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5ea8273adbb61f19412f497ff3d2d06e4f46aed",

I've been using ElevenLabs (Marcus voice) and the quality is amazing, but the pricing is unsustainable for long-form content (8-10 min videos).\n\nI've tried the usual suspects (Murf, Play.ht) but they sound too robotic or corporate.\n\n**I am looking for:**\n\n1. Something with a dark, authoritative, documentary-style tone.\n2. Either a cheaper paid alternative OR a high-quality GitHub/Local solution (I have a decent GPU if needed, like RVC or Tortoise).\n3. Has anyone tried tools like **Fish Audio** or **OpenAI TTS API** wrappers?\n\nAny \"underground\" or lesser-known recommendations would be appreciated. Thanks!",

As far as I've heard for English speakers higgs seemed to clone the best. The samples I heard from vibe weren't as close to the speakers voice for whatever reason.

VibeVoice and F5-TTS both support cloning from audio samples, so you could grab a few clips of the Marcus voice you like and use that as your reference.\n\nF5-TTS is probably the sweet spot... 330M params, solid quality, and the cloning is legit good. Kokoro is faster but doesn't do voice cloning, so you'd be stuck with its built-in voices.\n\nOne thing worth trying: feed it a 10-15 second sample of the exact ElevenLabs output you want to match. The closer your reference audio is to the target tone, the better the clone. I'd start with F5 before going to VibeVoice 7B since the VRAM requirements are more reasonable.",

      "text": "or: selling high-end LLM server gear is more fraught with risk than I realized.\n\n### AI Disclosure\n\nThis was written entirely by hand on my laptop in Sublime Text with zero AI involvement. Shit, I didn't even use spell check. All mistakes are my own.\n\n### tl;dr \n\nDuring an \"Item Not As Described (INAD)\" dispute, eBay ALWAYS sides with the buyer until the very last steps of the case no matter what the circumstances, despite all evidence, and in the face of all immediately obvious reason, logic, and common sense. Except it makes perfect sense and you might not even lose your money. Allow me to elaborate.\n\n### The Sale\n\nRewind to October 2025 when I replaced the incumbent Gigabyte MZ33-AR1 Epyc Zen5 motherboard with a Supermicro H14SSL-N for my inference rig. Long story short: don't use Gigabyte motherboards for 4-way Blackwell GPU setups unless sado-masochism is your thing. Anyway, I sold it to a seemingly nice chap on eBay for $900. He seemed a bit clueless about Epyc and compatibility issues, but we exchanged messages and he decided to go ahead with the \"no returns\" purchase of the as-new MZ33-AR1.\n\nOriginal box. All the case candy. As new. Undamaged. Fully working. With hi-res photos (taken on a Nikon D7000 with Nikon 17-55 f2.8 glass and processed in Capture One Pro) of all areas of the motherboard and CPU socket. This is important. \n\n### The Buyer\n\nFast forward a week or so: buyer hits me up with a bunch of Dr Debug codes (although he doesn't know they're Dr Debug codes, he just pulled \"error codes\" from the BMC) claiming the motherboard won't boot. I did him the solid of explaining Dr Debug and I provided a link to an explanation of the codes (https://forum.level1techs.com/t/list-of-dr-debug-bios-codes/114364). He was having issues with CPU initialization. I told him that sometimes re-seating CPU and RAM can help with these sorts of issues.\n\nRe-seating. This is also important.\n\nNext day he hits me up again: will I accept a return? No, because having installation difficulties is not a valid reason for return. Then nothing. Silence.\n\n### The Refund Claim\n\nCue the *very last day of the return window*: I get hit with an \"item not as described\" refund claim. Get this, the buyer:\n\n- uploaded photos of the motherboard with a bent and twisted CPU pin.\n- uploaded a photo of a blank white silkscreen rectangle on the motherboard with a giant red arrow pointing to it and a comment saying \"the motherboard is fake because of this white area\".\n- showed a photo of the computer monitor displaying the BMC interface in which the serial number of the BMC software was 1234567890ABCDEF. He claimed therefore the motherboard was a fake.\n\nWTF. I simultaneously exploded with rage at being accused of selling broken gear as working gear, while exploding with incredulity at the stupidity of trying to assert both damage AND blatantly ridiculous fakery in the same refund claim! My dude should have really picked just one fraudulent claim to keep it somewhat realistic, not two. I calmed down and figured the buyer probably bent the pins in a ham-fisted attempt to re-seat everything. No problem, I thought. I'll explain to eBay what's happening and they'll see reason before shutting this clown down. So I started going through the claim dispute process...\n\n### The Process\n\n...oh, the process. It's designed to (a) refund the buyer at the seller's cost in all cases, (b) be so egregiously demoralizing, time-consuming, and administratively difficult for sellers that they are incentivized to simply give up and accept the fleecing, and (c) automate as much of this process with as few humans in the loop as possible while simultaenously providing as few opportunities as possible for sellers to initiate any communication with eBay.\n\nIt went like this over a period of TWO MONTHS:\n\n- Report the buyer for \"abusing the returns process\".\n- With the new \"case\", it's possible to upload a set of photos and a block of text to refute the buyer's claim(s). \n- I uploaded ALL the hi-res photos I took for the listing's photoshoot in which it was abuntandly clear the motherboard was in perfect condition.\n- I also went to Gigabyte and found the page on the BMC's usermanual containing a screenshot showing the same serial number claimed by the buyer.\n- I went to Gigabyte's MZ33-AR1 web page and found a photo of the motherboard showing exactly the same white rectangle the buyer had called out as fakery.\n- Boom! Done! Solid documentary refutation of all the buyer's claims. Case closed. So I thought.\n- eBay found in favor of the buyer and instructed me to issue a return label.\n- I refused, outraged. No, I said. Look at the photos! He's lying!\n- eBay sent the buyer a label at my expense. He returned the motherboard with its busted CPU pin.\n- I again reported the buyer, showed photos of before and after damage, clearly showing he did the damage, not me.\n- eBay found in favor of the buyer AGAIN and deducted the full cost of the refund from my account.\n- Apoplectic, I hit the \"appeal\" button. I was taken to a webpage that said \"we'll call you in 3 minutes\". WTF?\n- 5 minutes later i got a call from eBay. \n- After briefly explaining the situation to a very engaged US-sounding representative, she told me I needed to do a couple of things:\n\t- Take the text of an email they just sent me (a Disclosure where I swear everything I told eBay is true) and paste it into a Word doc\n\t- Insert a photo/picture of my ink-written signature (luckily I have a scan of exactly that for business reasons).\n\t- Convert to PDF and upload to the secret link in the email they sent.\n\t- No joke, the lady actually stayed on the phone while I did all this! She received the PDF just seconds after I uploaded it.\n\t- This is, I am sure, mostly just another way of making it difficult to actually reverse the appeal.\n- But the rep was good to her word: eBay immediately reversed the decision and the money is back in my account as if the sale had happened like normal. I guess both me and the buyer got our money.\n\n### If It Happens To You\n\nMy advice if this happens to you: \n\n- Accept that no human cares about your case until the very, very last minutes of MONTHS of effort.\n- Accept that no matter what you do eBay will always automatically find in favor of the buyer.\n- Document everything contemporaneously and upload everything you possibly can when given opportunity to do so; you won't get any opportunities to do so again.\n- The data you upload is designed only for the human at the end of the appeals process, not someone looking at it during the claim process. Make it good. You'll need it later.\n- You're going to get enraged because during the claims process \"nothing makes sense\". It all makes sense: it's simply the cheapest way for eBay to handle this process at scale. Keep going.\n- Eventually eBay will find in favor of the buyer and close the case, automatically refunding the buyer \"on your behalf\". You will lose your money.\n- At this point you get the chance to appeal. BE READY. *This is the shot you've been waiting for all this time!* Have your phone, your laptop, your scanned signature, and a way to make PDFs ready BEFORE you initiate the \"call me\" feature.\n- Calmly explain what happened and request that common sense prevail. Ask that they refund your money. Common sense may actually prevail, assuming you made a good contemporaneous case with solid photographs, etc... and assuming you presented it well (not Mr Angry) on the phone... oh, and provided you can make and upload a PDF of your signature on-the-fly during the call!\n\nGood luck!\n\nEdit: please stop sending DMs asking for the eBay handle of the buyer. I'm not in the business of doxxing anyone. Thank you.",

Maybe 1-2% have had issues, courrier issues mostly or sometimes a product was faulty. I often write about who its not for and who shouldn't buy a product - so that deters the unsuitable buyers. \n\nI offer and allow returns because it lifts the conversion rate and if someone changes their mind or they're not happy - they won't sabotage the product. I've kept away from the more expensive end of the market so the risk is spread across various products too. Ironically sometimes the returned products have sold for more than the original price. \n\nThe thing with Motherboards is they can be very fragile or very specific. Like some people might not know certain slots, or compatibility before buying. You may need to offer more hand holding. And this buyer was clumsy. \n\nIf anyone UK based here wants to sell any computer / LLM gear, drives, HDDs, SSDs, old phones - I can give you a price and arrange shipping / as well as safe payment with Paypal. Or we can run it through Ebay if you prefer. I'm good at selling bits of tech and have a cash pile to buy decent stock. I can save you from an ordeal like this.

So you can decide yourself if you want it full in VRAM for fastest speed or put some layer into RAM and have more VRAM free for a bit larger context.\n\nIt is also very good rated for NSFW on the UGI leaderboard and the best Qwen 30B A3B finetune in this point. But not sure if it match into what you want to do with it.

You can easily stop it midway, correct errors in the text, and continue where you left off.\n\nYou could use Magistral Small 2509 - it has a think mode and it certainlly smarter. But it has a drawback: the entire text generation process must be run in one go.. And if a small deviation occurs during the \"think mode\" (or something important to the plot is simply missed), you could only drop everything and regenerate the entire text from the start.\n\nAnd newest version, Ministral-3-14B-Reasoning-2512, is certainly even smarter, thinking better and can generate long, voluminous texts. But the results from this generation... are simply unsatisfactory. I've reverted to the previous models.\n\nAny of them may write that they cannot accept your request - this can be easily corrected by clicking the \"regenerate\" button again or changing some brutal words in the request with more neutral synonyms.",

      "text": "So I am training a 1B model right now on my 7900 XTX with some custom kernels I wrote, and while it is training I wanted to optimize the kernels at the same time. However, my VRAM is nearly maxed doing training, so its not ideal.\n\nThen I realized maybe my 2 CU Raphael iGPU might be able to help since I only need to run some limited samples and the speed isn't as important for optimization as it is for training. After doing some research, it turned out that not only does ROCm recognize the iGPU, but a Linux feature called Graphics Translation Table (GTT) for AMD iGPUs can use up to 128 GB of system memory as VRAM. It even allocates it dynamically, so it isn't removed from your CPU's memory pool until it is allocated. I think a lot of people running Strix Halo are probably using the bios setting, but if you are running Linux you should check to see if GTT works for you since its dynamically allocated.\n\nThis isn't very useful for most people:\n\n1) It isn't going to be good for inference because iGPUs are very very slow, and usually the CPU itself is faster for inference.\n\n2) I'm accessing ROCm directly via C++ / HIP kernels, so I can avoid all the support issues ROCm has for iGPUs in the python stack\n\nHowever, for development it is actually pretty awesome. I allocated 24 GB of GTT so now the iGPU can load a full training run that my main GPU can run so I can profile it. Meanwhile my main GPU is doing long term loss convergence tests in parallel. Since RDNA iGPUs have been around for a while now, this enables big memory AMD GPU kernel development for cheap.\n\nAlso it might be interesting for developing hybrid CPU/GPU architectures. The MI300A does exist which has unified HBM tied to a CPU and giant iGPU. A standard ryzen laptop could kind of sort of simulate it for cheap. Stuff like vector indexing on the CPU into big GEMMs on the GPU could be done without PCIE overhead.\n\nI thought it was cool enough to post. Probably a \"Cool story bro\" moment for most of you though haha.",

The default is -1 (It’s VRAM size if 3GB < VRAM < 3/4 RAM, otherwise 3/4 RAM size).\n\nSo as long as you have more than 4GB of RAM, the driver automatically allows up to 3/4 of the RAM to be allocated to the iGPU.\n\nI've run stuff on a Vega 8 iGPU on a laptop using llama.cpp and it does work. However, it's not a great experience if you want to watch videos (or do basically anything else GUI-wise) at the same time, since llama.cpp hogs all the memory bandwidth and causes everything else to stutter. GPU scheduling is pretty much non-existent on Linux AFAIK, so there's not really a great way to mitigate this atm.\n\nAlso a hint for fellow ThinkPad users: even though the spec sheet says only a certain amount of RAM is supported, you should probably be able to add more without issues. My current E595's specs say only up to 32GB is supported, but I added a 32GB stick alongside the existing 8GB for a total of 40GB and it works.",

      "text": "I saw the recent [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1px1c41/head_of_engineering_minimax_ai_on_minimax_m2_int4/) here regarding MiniMax engineer's tweet about why they decided *against* using int4 QAT for the MiniMax M2.1 model.\n\nInterestingly, at the time of the K2 Thinking release, a Kimi infra engineer posted a deep dive on Zhihu explaining why native int4 QAT was actually crucial for them. I’ve summarized the key takeaways below to offer a different perspective on the 'to quant or not to quant' debate.\n\n**TL;DR:** Kimi found int4 QAT is essential for **MoE latency**, **long-context stability**, and **speeding up the RL training loop**.\n\n# Decoding is Memory-Bound (Latency Focus)\n\nUnlike the MiniMax case, Kimi found that for their specific MoE architecture (which is highly sparse), the decoding phase is almost exclusively memory-bound. By using W4A16 (4-bit weights, 16-bit activations), they reduced memory usage significantly. This allowed the model to fit on fewer GPUs, which reduced inter-device communication overhead, a major factor in lowering end-to-end latency for users.\n\n# PTQ Failed at \"Thinking\" Lengths\n\nThe team initially tried standard Post-Training Quantization (PTQ). While it worked for short responses, it fell apart for the long chain-of-thought \"thinking\" process. As generation length increased, quantization errors accumulated, leading to degradation. Furthermore, PTQ struggled with sparse experts; if an expert wasn't hit frequently during the calibration step with the calibration dataset, it essentially \"forgot\" knowledge. QAT (Quantization Aware Training) was necessary to make the model \"lossless\" compared to the BF16 baseline.\n\n# A less discussed benefit: Faster RL Training\n\nThis is the point that often gets overlooked: Int4 QAT wasn't just for inference serving, it accelerated the training process itself. In Reinforcement Learning, the model spends a massive amount of time in the \"rollout\" phase (generating text). By using the Int4 model for these rollouts, they reduced the total time for an RL iteration by 10-20%. It also reduced the discrepancy between the training forward pass and the inference engine.\n\n# Why Int4 and not FP4?\n\nThey chose standard Int4 over newer formats like FP4 to maintain compatibility with existing hardware (non-Blackwell GPUs) and to utilize mature, highly efficient kernels like Marlin.\n\nIn summary, I believe there isn't a one-size-fits-all answer regarding quantization. It depends heavily on the model's parameters and specific architecture. It is a matter of trade-offs.\n\n[ AI translation, there may be some translation errors.](https://preview.redd.it/dzmceu5zybag1.png?width=1362&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0ba8f78c6e5ade3463a1c62fba1d338a1c01ce9)\n\n",
