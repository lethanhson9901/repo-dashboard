Memory bandwidth is the actual bottleneck for CPU inference, not compute, and going from single to dual-channel literally doubles your throughput ceiling. People overlook this constantly and blame the CPU when their 32GB single stick setup crawls. The MoE architecture choice is smart too since you're only hitting 2.4B active parameters per token, which keeps the working set small enough to stay in cache on that i3. The Chinese token drift on the iGPU is interesting, I wonder if that's a precision issue with OpenVINO's INT8/FP16 path on UHD 620 since those older iGPUs have limited compute precision. Great writeup and respect for sharing this from Burma, this is exactly the kind of accessibility content this sub needs more of.",

It bridges the gap between 'unusable' and 'daily driver' for budget builds.\n\nBest MoE models are based on your RAM. if You have more Ram and can find the best optimization - Try Qwen 30B-A3B , it's seems like gold standard for most case.

The logic remains 100% solid, but it might forget it's speaking English for a second.\n\nReading Speed: While not as fast as a $40/mo cloud subscription, 10 t/s is faster than the average human can read (5-6 t/s). Why pay for speed you can't even use?",

Said a little bluntly, llama.cpp is highly specialized code; Ollama could be vibe coded by a 1st/2nd year student. \n\n  \nOllama took llama.cpp and wrapped it in their own app, making things like swapping models extremely easy.  Ollama built a strong reputation and user base as open source software, tightly coupled with the llama.cpp project. They were the usability and utility people, drawing on llama.cpps contstant optimizations and development to accommodate new models, new quantizations, etc. But up until this point, everything that Ollama did was open source. All good. \n\nAbout a year ago, Ollama changed direction towards monetizing their app. They introduced a closed-source desktop app, and made it the default download on their website. They \"forked\" llama.cpp, meaning they started making changes to llama.cpp's code instead of building on top of/wrapping around it (and doing a poor job of it, as you can see). The implications of their fork became clear when Ollama announced 'day 1 support' of some new model. I don't remember which, but it was a big deal. Except their implementation was complete shit, it literally didn't work. A week or so later, Ollama copy/pasted llama.cpp's new code for that model into their fork, and *as far as I remember* either didn't mention it in their release notes, or pretended they had fixed a bug unrelated to their implementation of that model.\n\nThis is a big fucking no-no in open source software. It's not illegal - everything they do complies with llama.cpp's license. But it goes against all norms and conventions.",

But it goes against all norms and conventions.\n\n\nThere’s some nuance here because what you’re saying is not entirely correct. llama.cpp is MIT license, which is one of the most permissive types of licenses. \n\nYou’re allowed to use the code commercially, modify it, distribute / redistribute it, sublicense it, and include it in proprietary/closed-source software.\n\nSaying it’s a big no-no isn’t really accurate. Commercial software is built on the back of open source software with permissive licenses. \n\nSome examples:\n- SQLite: embedded in browsers, phones, and operating systems. Most users aren’t aware of or never see attribution.\n- curl: ships inside huge amounts of software and firmware with credit usually buried in a license file somewhere that no one is aware of.\n- React UI libraries: countless packages power proprietary SaaS products and are used on nearly every major site you visit. And many are MIT licensed. \n- BSD networking stack: foundational to macOS, PlayStation, and many WiFi routers.\n- zlib: compression library used in PNG, game engines, operating systems, and tons of commercial software and is rarely visibly credited.\n\nSo, it’s really rich when open source maintainers like ggerganov get salty about people using their code. If you wanted attribution and it was that important to you, an MIT license was the wrong license to choose when setting up the project.",

Which duplicates effort and has in the past caused models to then not be supported by the rest of the ecosystem when prominent model makers skip upstream llamacpp. So you'd then expect that if they go their own way and have their own unique engine alongside the llamacpp one that it is unique, but if they are copying the bugs of llamacpp it means its really just rebuilding what llamacpp is doing already. They could have just used it since llamacpp is part of their program.\n\nCombine that with very little credit for llamacpp and you can imagine why ggerganov finds this amusing.",

That would let the open-source community build better-aligned models without needing Anthropic's scale.\n\n\n\nEither way, Anthropic engaging with HuggingFace at all is a signal worth watching.

Here's one of the [earlier versions](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1poybe9/llama_32_3b_mri_build_progress/). There were a bunch more investigative posts where the author used the extended tool to find and visualize patterns, like nodes being responsible for certain things, or being more sensitive to quantization. Unfortunately the account was deleted recently, making it difficult to find all the latest posts on that.\n\nSo, visualizing static properties clearly has its benefits, and another take at the dynamic visualization could also yield nice results.",

The key highlights from PR #43830:\n\n**Two model families** are being added — a **dense Qwen3.5** (reference: 9B-Instruct) and a **MoE Qwen3.5** (reference: 35B-A3B-Instruct, 256 experts with top-8 routing).\n\n**The standout architectural feature** is a **hybrid attention design** — approximately 75% of layers use **Gated DeltaNet linear attention** (a recurrent mechanism with causal conv1d, similar in spirit to Mamba-style state space models) while every 4th layer uses standard **full softmax attention** with GQA. This gives sub-quadratic complexity for most layers while retaining full attention's expressiveness periodically.\n\nOther notable details:\n- **Partial RoPE** — only 25% of the 256-dim head gets rotary embeddings\n- **M-RoPE** (3D position encoding: temporal, height, width) for multimodal inputs\n- **Vision encoder** inherited from Qwen3-VL (27-layer ViT, patch size 16, spatial merge 2×2)\n- The models build on the already-merged **Qwen3-Next** architecture (PR #40771), with Qwen3.5 refactoring the projection structure in the DeltaNet module (separate `in_proj_qkv`, `in_proj_z`, `in_proj_\n\nMore detail: https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/93b0a136-fe1c-4077-892b-291bb90026f2",

In terms of proprietary models, my vibe is that it sits somewhere around `claude-sonnet-4`?\n\nIt's also great that the `qwen3-next` architecture makes KV cache memory usage very efficient over long sequences, so it's possible to run it on long context on consumer hardware.\n\nThe initial Instruct and Thinking releases weren't super exciting though. Particularly the thinking model was a bit of a disappointment, very long CoT (mostly just repetition) and not very good at agents (compared to something like `gpt-oss-120b`). Seemed to be ultra-optimized for math and coding competition type problems.",

I ask them how many models they train a year and they tell me under 10 models a year. I just laugh because it cost me 3 to 5 dollars per trained model on runpod. \n\nThink about it, 10 models at 3 to 5 bucks per model is like 40 to 50 bucks a year. 10 years at max is 500 bucks. In 10 years.  5090 costs 4000 or more. \n\nMoral of the story is, you can rent a a crazy expensive GPU for a few dollars in order to train a small model that will give you really good output on CPU for pennies on the dollar and it will outperform much larger models.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e9q4ky8f76ig1.png?width=1665&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2d0a7c77615a21abdc04efc768da684e014a192\n\nRTX PRO 6000 with 96GB vram, 16 cores and 188GB of RAM for 1.89 an hour..\n\nI am not promoting runpod, I am just showing you that to train a model, you do not need to spend crazy money. It will cost you a few dollars, that it. \n\nAfter you train it and optimize it, you can run it on CPU and get fast response and really good token generation as it is a small optimized model and will outperform any model out there as it has been trained for that specific task. \n\nGood luck people.",

Strawberry seems to perform far better than that.\n\n> if it performs vastly different/worse it's usually a sign of a bug\n\nyes strawberry was performing weirdly in training. Retention was not working well with SPDA. The problem was that the generated weights were too noisy for SPDA. AFT managed to handle that however SPDA couldn't. That's why I added post normalization in both `produce` and `forward` functions in Retention. That fixed the bug completely.\n\n> As for data sets, any reason why you're not using any of the hundreds available on huggingface?

I was just bored. Had nothing to do so I decided to waste my time by manually scrapping datasets. lol! Also the reason why I didn't use TinyStories cuz it's just too simple.\n\n> You seem to prepend the sink token at every single step. Is that intentional?

Think like this. input `<|sink|>Test prompt` -> model predicts `ing` which makes it `Test prompting`. Notice how I dropped `<|sink|>` in the final results. That's what's happening. I'll implement it at an architecture level similar to GPT-OSS",

You can make the learning rate “breathe” as per difficult examples vs easy examples using it, setting a dynamic learning rate. You can tweak Adam to have this lambert W self balance the learning rate and it will automatically spend more time in the hard landscapes and grok fast. But this only works when you do full FP16 fine tune or train. Quantized it didn’t work at all.",

Every time a new massive teacher model drops, the 30-70B range gets a noticeable bump within weeks. Ive been using Qwen derivatives for production workloads and the quality jump from distilled models is real.\n\nPlus lets be honest, for 95% of actual use cases a well tuned 30B model handles it just fine.

If you have a specific kind of task type or a domain you are working that you want to run this model for, try the full model out somewhere online once it hits. Then after you do a couple of quick and dirty projects in it, take your prompts, and use that to generate a set of new prompts in the same domain or of the same task type. \n\nOnce you have your promptset then you load the model with REAP (code is on cerebras github) on a GPU provider if you don't the hardware yourself. Let REAP run through YOUR custom promptset instead of the default (but do compare your promptset to the default to get an idea of a baseline).\n\nThen REAP will prune whatever parameters are less likely to be important to your application for this model and you can begin your quantization. I personally really like all of u/noctrex 's quants and if you look around you can figure out most or all of how to do those.\n\nRemember though, your promptset is how REAP calibrates what to chop off so check that default promptset and make sure your custom one has as much coverage as possible for your use case.

      "text": "Like many of you, I like to use LLM as tools to help improve my daily life, from editing my emails, to online search.\n\nHowever, I like to use them as an \"inner voice\" to discuss general thoughts and get constructive critic. For instance, when I face life-related problems take might take me hours or days to figure out, a short session with an LLM can significantly quicken that process.\n\nSince the original Llama was leaked, I've been using LLMs locally, but they I always felt they were lacking behind OpenAI or Google models. Thus, I would always go back to using ChatGPT or Gemini when I need serious output. If I needed a long chatting session or help with long documents, I didn't have choice to use the SOTA models, and that means willingly leaking personal or work-related data.\n\nFor me, Gemini-3 is the best model I've ever tried. I don't know about you, but I struggle sometimes to follow chatGPT's logic, but I find it easy to follow Gemini's. It's like that best friend who just gets you and speaks in your language.\n\nWell, that was the case until I tried Qwen3-Coder-Next. For the first time, I could have stimulating and enlightening conversations with a local model. Previously, I used not-so-seriously Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking as local daily driver, but that model always felt a bit inconsistent; sometimes, I get good output, and sometimes I get dumb one.\n\nHowever, Qwen3-Coder-Next is more consistent, and you can feel that it's a pragmatic model trained to be a problem-solver rather than being a sycophant. Unprompted, it will suggest an author, a book, or a theory that already exists that might help. I genuinely feel I am conversing with a fellow thinker rather than a echo chamber constantly paraphrasing my prompts in a more polish way. It's the closest model to Gemini-2.5/3 that I can run locally in terms of quality of experience.\n\n**For non-coders, my point is do not sleep on Qwen3-Coder-Next simply because it's has the \"coder\" tag attached.**\n\nI can't wait for for Qwen-3.5 models. If Qwen3-Coder-Next is an early preview, we are in a real treat.",

The coder-trained variants consistently outperform their general counterparts on structured reasoning tasks that have nothing to do with code.\n\n\n\nMy theory: code training teaches models to decompose problems into discrete steps with clear dependencies, which is exactly what you need for general problem-solving. When I switched our internal eval pipeline from Qwen3-Next to Qwen3-Coder-Next, accuracy on multi-step reasoning went up \\~12% with zero prompt changes.\n\n\n\nThe \"coder\" label is genuinely underselling these models.",

It's easy to find edge case where the censorship hit hard. If you are unlucky, the refusal can even be quite aggressive (this is the worse of 7 tries, but every one of them is refusal).  \nCompared to GLM models (at least GLM 4.7 flash), the model shield it's answer in \"I give a neutral text about a sensitive topic\" but manage to give the facts and complete an honest work.  \nI mean no disrespect, and I'm also tired when China is constantly presented as the vilain, Qwen3 Coder Next is the best coding model i could host. But some people are quite sensitive about democratic censorship in academic context, they don't want an AI to influence student toward less democracy.

Im very impressed by Nemo 30B. 1M+ Token Context cache, runs on one 3090, CPU offloading for experts. Does 35 t/s which is faster than I can read at least. Usually slow as fuck at this large a context window. Feed it a whole book or research paper and its done summarizing in like a few mins. This really makes long context windows on local hardware possible. The only other contender  I have tried is Seed OSS 36b and it was much slower by about 20 tokens.",

I wasn't necessary thinking of using as an agent model (tho, maybe, why not!) so I was thinking the cache quant would not be as big of a deal.\n\nThat said, I did task Claude to do some tests (open claude in tmux, give it access to my llama server in a tmux pane and ask it to iterate config to measure speed and quality) for me overnight to determine if the q4 cache had an effect and the consensus was that it didn't have a noticeable impact and the vram save enabled me. However, I didn't push informatin retrieval on a giant context and that might be the part where the q4 is problematic.\n\nSummary:\n**q4_0 KV cache has zero measurable quality impact on this model.** Across 16 tests (math, code, knowledge, needle-in-a-haystack, instruction following, long-form coherence), both configs produced **identical or near-identical outputs** with matching correctness. This is expected given the architecture: only 6 out of 52 layers use KV cache.\n\n> q4_0 KV cache quantization only affects the 6 attention layers. The other 46 layers (88.5% of the model) are completely unaffected. This is fundamentally different from a pure transformer where q4_0 would affect every single layer.\n\n\nNow, is that actually true, I'll be honest, I do not know.\n\n| Metric | q4_0 KV | f16 KV (default) |\n|--------|---------|-------------------|\n| **Generation speed** | ~59.5 t/s | ~59.5 t/s |\n| **Prompt processing** | ~100-130 t/s | ~100-130 t/s |\n| **VRAM usage** | 9.0 GB | 10.1 GB |\n| **VRAM saved** | **1.1 GB** | baseline |\n\n\nI'd be curious if those results actually make sense: https://github.com/jo-nike/experiments/blob/main/nemotron-kv-cache-quality-report.md\n\nI did launch a new series of test to get a better view on the \"needle in a haystack\" test that will probe bigger context window for information retrieval.\n\nOnce those tests are done, I'll get you a t/s for the config you asked and get back to you",

It delivers identical needle-retrieval accuracy to f16 while saving 1.1 GB of VRAM and providing faster prompt processing. The 6-attention-layer hybrid architecture makes this model exceptionally tolerant of aggressive KV quantization.\n\n---\n\nNow for your question, q8 for k/v cache, i was pushing it to it's max here:\n\n > - 128k: 90.9 t/s, ncmoe=12\n > - 256k: 87.7 t/s, ncmoe=15\n > - 1mil: 62.7t/s, ncmoe=30 (but that crashed on bigger context)\n\nMade me review my q4 config which gave me:\n\n > - 128k: 97.0 t/s, nccmoe=9\n > - 256k: 89.1 t/s, ncmoe=11\n > - 1mil: 64.9 t/s, ncmoe=30\n\nHere's the report if you're interested, it goes in quite bigger details such as t/s over context size: https://github.com/jo-nike/experiments/blob/main/nemotron-q8-kv-cache-results.md\n\n**Bottom line**: \n\nWith my setup, at 256k content, I'm probably better use Q8. At 128k content, I'm probably better with Q4. The difference between them is marginal.\n\n---\n\n**Testing Notes**: \n\n- That methodology of using Claude via claude code as an assistant to iterate over settings, test speed and quality and document the experimentation, was really great and a giant time saver. Claude basically created itself a script, run it, monitor it, take notes. \n\n- I was using sonnet 4.5 for this because I abused opus this week 🤦, but I would have used Opus otherwise, a local llm could definitely work too.\n\n- Flash attention requires transient vram that grows quite a bit with 500k+ context. Caused oom, had to readjust to give more headroom to flash attention by offloading more to cpu. **Don't overly pack your vram if you intend on actually using the whole 1m context**, you'd risk oom as the context grow due to FA overhead need.\n\n- I could probably optimized the 1mil q4 config a little bit, i offloaded to give FA space and because it's so long to generate the big context, I got tired and didn't care to redo the test to squeeze every little drop of vram I could.\n\n- Generating a 950,000 tokens context takes something like 30 minutes with q8, might have been a bit fast with q4, I didn't time sadly.\n\n- t/s drop significantly once the context get filled. For example, Q4 gets to 19.1 t/s on a 1million context.\n\n- I got that Blackwell gpu recently, hadn't had much chances to play with mxfp4 before, definitely interesting! It's also the first time i try such a big context.\n\n- I probably used about 300k of claude tokens to run these optimization exercises without trying to optimize my usage.\n\nI'd be curious to hear if those reports make sense. I'm quite trusting of Claude + it's not a lot of analysis (tho there is some), it's really just running processes and then compiling results. It does look quite good to me.\n\nIf interested in my llama.cpp config, let me know if you think I can optimize that even more:\n\n---\n\n[Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-MXFP4_MOE-256K]\n\nmodel = /mnt/data/models/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-MXFP4_MOE.gguf\n\nn-gpu-layers = 52\n\nn-cpu-moe = 15\n\nctx-size = 262144\n\nflash-attn = on\n\ncache-type-k = q8_0\n\ncache-type-v = q8_0\n\nparallel = 1\n\nthreads = 16\n\nmlock = 1\n\n---\n\n[Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-MXFP4_MOE-1M]\n\nmodel = /mnt/data/models/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-MXFP4_MOE.gguf\n\nn-gpu-layers = 52\n\nn-cpu-moe = 30\n\nctx-size = 1048576\n\nflash-attn = on\n\ncache-type-k = q4_0\n\ncache-type-v = q4_0\n\nparallel = 1\n\nthreads = 16\n\nmlock = 1",

      "text": "I've tried lots of \"small\" models < 60 GB in the past. GLM 4.5 Air, GLM 4.7 Flash, GPT OSS 20B and 120B, Magistral, Devstral, Apriel Thinker, previous Qwen coders, Seed OSS, QwQ, DeepCoder, DeepSeekCoder, etc. So what's different with Qwen3 Coder Next in OpenCode or in Roo Code with VSCodium?\n\n* **Speed**: The reasoning models would often yet not always produce rather good results. However, now and then they'd enter reasoning loops despite correct sampling settings, leading to no results at all in a large over-night run. Aside from that the sometimes extensive reasoning takes quite some time for the multiple steps that OpenCode or Roo would induce, slowing down interactive work *a lot*. Q3CN on the other hand is an instruct MoE model, doesn't have internal thinking loops and is relatively quick at generating tokens.\n* **Quality**: Other models occasionally botched the tool calls of the harness. This one seems to work reliably. Also I finally have the impression that this can handle a moderately complex codebase with a custom client & server, different programming languages, protobuf, and some quirks. It provided good answers to extreme multi-hop questions and made reliable full-stack changes. Well, almost. On Roo Code it was sometimes a bit lazy and needed a reminder to really go deep to achieve correct results. Other models often got lost.\n* **Context size**: Coding on larger projects needs context. Most models with standard attention eat all your VRAM for breakfast. With Q3CN having 100k+ context is easy. A few other models also supported that already, yet there were drawbacks in the first two mentioned points.\n\nI run the model this way:  \n`set GGML_CUDA_GRAPH_OPT=1`\n\n`llama-server -m Qwen3-Coder-Next-UD-Q4_K_XL.gguf -ngl 99 -fa on -c 120000 --n-cpu-moe 29 --temp 0 --cache-ram 0`\n\nThis works well with 24 GB VRAM and 64 GB system RAM when there's (almost) nothing else on the GPU. Yields about 180 TPS prompt processing and 30 TPS generation speed for me.\n\n* `temp 0`? Yes, works well for instruct for me, no higher-temp \"creativity\" needed. Prevents the *very occasional* issue that it outputs an unlikely (and incorrect) token when coding.\n* `cache-ram 0`? The cache was supposed to be fast (30 ms), but I saw 3 second query/update times after each request. So I didn't investigate further and disabled it, as it's only one long conversation history in a single slot anyway.\n* `GGML_CUDA_GRAPH_OPT`? Experimental option to get more TPS. Usually works, yet breaks processing with some models.\n\n**OpenCode vs. Roo Code**:\n\nBoth solved things with the model, yet with OpenCode I've seen slightly more correct answers and solutions. But: Roo asks *by default* about every single thing, even harmless things like running a syntax check via command line. This can be configured with an easy permission list to not stop the automated flow that often. OpenCode on the other hand just permits everything by default in code mode. One time it encountered an issue, uninstalled and reinstalled packages in an attempt of solving it, removed files and drove itself into a corner by breaking the dev environment. Too autonomous in trying to \"get things done\", which doesn't work well on bleeding edge stuff that's not in the training set. Permissions can of course also be configured, but the default is \"YOLO\".\n\nAside from that: Despite running with only a locally hosted model, and having disabled update checks and news downloads, OpenCode (Desktop version) tries to contact a whole lot of IPs on start-up.",

Without that, the prompt processing was dominating query time for any agentic coding where the agents were dragging in large amounts of context. Having to offload another layer or two to system RAM didn't seem to hurt the eval performance nearly as much as that helped the processing.\n\nI'm using the IQ4\\_NL quant - tried the MXFP4 too, but IQ4\\_NL seemed slightly better. I am seeing very occasional breakdowns and failures of tool calling, but it mostly works.",

              "text": "Setting it that high gives me 2.5x more prompt processing speed, that's quite a lot. Yet the usage was mostly dominated by inference time for me, and this drops it to 75% due to less offloaded layers. With batch 2048 it's still 83% and 2x more PP speed. Context compaction speed is notably impacted by inference time (generating 20k tokens), so I prefer having as much of the model as possible on the GPU, as my usage is rarely impacted by having to re-process lots of data.",

It seems to be much better at caching prefill and managing context, so not only do I get more tokens per second from a MoE model, the biggest bonus is how much less time is spent waiting for the context/prefill.

More direct approach towards the solution, sometimes better approaches that the Q3CN didn't find at all. Yet still, for \"just getting some dev work done\" it's no longer needed to have the latest and greatest. Q3CN is the first local model that's usable for me in this area.

That avoids internal reasoning loops and keeps latency predictable, which really matters for agent-style tools and long runs.\n\nTool calling and structured outputs are noticeably more reliable, and the long context (100k+) is actually usable on 24 GB VRAM thanks to its attention/memory characteristics. Combined with deterministic sampling (temp 0), it behaves stably for real-world coding instead of drifting or stalling.",

I've had issues with some models hallucinating tool calls or breaking the JSON format mid-stream.\n\nAlso—curious about your OpenCode vs Roo Code comparison. The \"YOLO permissions\" thing in OpenCode is exactly why I've been hesitant. Did you end up configuring stricter permissions, or just stick with Roo for production work?\n\nAppreciate the detailed write-up on the llama-server flags too.

With that approach one can (pre)load the required experts to maximize generation speed without having to wait that much for the comparatively slow SSD. Maybe you did something similar?

[ggerganov states](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/19408#issuecomment-3866421943) though that reprocessing would be unavoidable if something early in the prompt is changed - which is exactly what happens when Roo Code for example switches from \"Architect\" to \"Code\" mode.\n\nHow I use OpenCode with 24GB VRAM? Exactly with the model, quant and command line stated in my posting, although prompt processing [could be faster](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qz5uww/comment/o48mli1/) as pointed out in another comment. With Roo the initial processing takes between 15 to 40 seconds before it jumps into action, yet as it'll iterate quite some time on its own anyway, waiting for prefill isn't that important for me.",

We initially tried to save budget by looking at standard PCIe servers instead of the HGX/SXM form factors, and honestly, the \"paper math\" vs. reality was a brutal wake-up call.))\n\n^(Thought this might save someone else the headache if you're trying to move from inference to actual training runs on-prem.)\n\n^(1. The \"NVLink Tax\" isn't optional for training. We tried to model this out with PCIe Gen5, but the math just falls apart. When you're doing All-Reduce ops across nodes, PCIe caps out at \\~128 GB/s. NVLink is pushing \\~900 GB/s. If you cheap out here, you basically end up with expensive GPUs sitting idle, waiting for data. For inference, PCIe is totally fine. For training, it’s a bottleneck that kills your ROI.)\n\n^(2. Storage checkpoints are violent. This was the biggest surprise. Everyone talks about GPU VRAM, but nobody warned us about the checkpoint writes. A 175B model dumps a \\~2.5TB checkpoint. To keep the GPUs from stalling, you need to write that to disk in under a minute. Our standard NFS filer absolutely choked. We had to look at parallel filesystems (Weka/VAST or local NVMe raid just to survive the write bursts.))\n\n^(3. You don't need InfiniBand, but Ethernet is annoying. We didn't have the budget/staff for an InfiniBand fabric, so we went with RoCEv2 on standard switches. It works, but it’s finicky. One silent buffer overflow or a misconfigured PFC (Priority Flow Control setting can stall the whole cluster. If you go Ethernet, monitor your pause frames religiously.))\n\n^(Anyway, I wrote up a longer deep dive with the specific diagrams and our decision framework for \"Sandbox vs Production\" builds if anyone is interested. Link is pinned in my profile.)\n\n^(Happy to answer questions on the networking side - that RoCEv2 tuning took years off my life.)",

To fight the PCIe bottleneck, try to crank up your Gradient Accumulation steps. Basically, do more work locally on the card before syncing.

The former lacks dedicated tensor memory (TMEM) which means you have to use register based tensor instructions . This makes it a pain to find kernels that even work (e.g for flash attention or QAT) and sometimes requires you to write your own, and even then it’s a lot harder to saturate sm120 tensor cores in flash attention kernels because the tensor instructions use so many registers that you can’t issue enough warps to saturate the memory controllers.

You absolutely lose out trying to use that for training. \n\nQuick note, pcie 5.0 does rate to 128GB bidirectional, but it's essentially non-existent for full rate bidirectional. Best case you are getting 64GB/s but most cases you are going to be looking at 32-64GB/s bidirectional (if code is well designed) or 32GB/s unidirectional. That is really where you get hit hard with those all-reduces.\n\nAlso note, if you have spare compute vs storage speed you could reduce checkpoints. There is a subchapter in that reference where you can see how the checkpointing/caching hits differently. Checkpointing trades O(n^2 ) compute for O(n) memory, but you have to remember that we often talk about FLOPs in Tera or bigger vs memory in Giga so it's not automatic that you want that tradeoff!",

You will likely want to look at and adopt DCQCN (ECN+PFC combo) presuming your switches support it. Or some people use ECN only and no PFC, which can work pretty well for RoCE workflows.\n\nUsing PCIe based H100s is also not helping you unfortunately if you are running multi-node training because the H100s are being throttled by your limited NIC throughput and PCIe throughput (as you noted). SXM (DGX/HGX) goes a long way to fix this as each GPU is assigned a NIC 1:1 and those NICs are 400G.\n\nAnd firm yes on checkpoints. People underlook this all the time and I have regular conversations about it. The key thing is while you are dumping that checkpoint, all the GPUs are idle so getting that checkpoint across the wire to your shared storage asap is critical. \n\nEthernet works well for back-end training fabrics now and is a lot more baked than it was a year or two back, but it does require good networking knowledge and comfort level with RoCE behavior and being able to tune/profile your fabric.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nLast week I shared preliminary results on a new subquadratic attention mechanism ([https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qol3s5/preliminary\\_new\\_subquadratic\\_attention\\_20k\\_toks](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qol3s5/preliminary_new_subquadratic_attention_20k_toks)). Following up with the full release: model + inference code are now available.\n\n**TL;DR**: 30B model achieving O(L\\^(3/2)) scaling instead of O(L\\^2). Enables 1M–10M context on a single GPU with decode speeds that stay practical even at extreme context lengths. Ships with an OpenAI-compatible server and CLI to try out.\n\n\\- 🤗 **Model**: [https://huggingface.co/concavity-ai/superlinear-exp-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/concavity-ai/superlinear-exp-v0.1)\n\n\\- 💻 **Code**: [https://github.com/concavity-ai/superlinear](https://github.com/concavity-ai/superlinear) (\\`pip install superlinear\\`)\n\n\\- 📄 **Paper**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18401](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18401)\n\n\n\n**Main Idea**\n\nYou can think of attention as a search algorithm to find relevant information for next-token prediction. Standard attention is basically O(L) brute-force search. We're doing O(L\\^0.5) jump-search with learned routing: score O(L\\^0.5) candidate spans, select top-k, then do token-level attention within the selected spans.\n\nThis gives **O(L\\^(3/2)) total complexity** while preserving **random context access** — any token can be selected by content-dependent routing, unlike fixed sliding windows. When you 10x the context length, the search budget only grows by \\~3.2x. That subquadratic scaling really matters for long context.\n\n\n\n**Performance (Single B200 GPU)**\n\n    | Context Length | Prefill (tok/s) | Decode (tok/s) | Memory  |\n    |----------------|-----------------|----------------|---------|\n    | 1M tokens      | ~20,202         | ~109           | 66 GB   |\n    | 10M tokens     | ~5,576          | ~76            | ~120 GB |\n\nKey point: 1M → 10M context (10x increase) only drops decode speed by \\~30%, not the 10x slowdown with dense attention.\n\n\n\n**Why This Matters**\n\nWhen you have fast long-context inference, usage patterns change. The key is **maintaining the cache** instead of reprocessing everything:\n\n\\- ***Almost-infinite chat***: KV cache in memory for instant responses, save/restore sessions to disk for persistence\n\n\\- ***Document Q&A***: Load documents once, ask cross-document questions without reprocessing (our GitHub example: 8 Wikipedia articles with cross-document reasoning)\n\n\\- ***Long-form generation***: 20k+ token reasoning on difficult math problems and coherent long article writing, all with maintained context\n\nEarly results: perfect NIAH at 512K context (up from 256K last week), cross-document reasoning working, subquadratic scaling working in practice.\n\nSince no existing inference engine is going to support our custom kernels, we built the full stack ourselves: Triton kernels, OpenAI-compatible server, session snapshots, chunked prefill, CLI with BM25 RAG.\n\n\n\n**Limitations & Next Steps**\n\n***Current limitations:***\n\n\\- This is an \\*\\*architecture + systems feasibility release\\*\\*, not production-quality\n\n\\- Limited training data (initial SFT only)\n\n\\- Comprehensive evals beyond NIAH still needed\n\n\\- FP16 only (66GB for 1M context) — quantization coming soon\n\n***Quantization*** **(coming soon):**\n\n\\- 4-bit/8-bit quantization to run 1M context on 24GB consumer GPUs\n\n\\- Target: RTX 4090 / RTX 5090 with full 1M context\n\n\\- 2M context on 48GB cards (e.g., RTX 6000 Ada)\n\n***Hardware support:***\n\n\\- Currently CUDA only (B200, RTX 6000 Blackwell tested)\n\n\\- AMD ROCm port coming (Triton kernels should make this straightforward)\n\n\\- Eventually Apple Silicon (harder but not impossible)\n\n***Training & Quality improvements:***\n\n\\- Scaling up SFT data with more long-context examples\n\n\\- Potentially doing continued pretraining on long documents\n\n\\- Expanding perfect NIAH range beyond 512K\n\n\\- Real-world long-context benchmarks (book QA, codebase analysis, multi-document reasoning)\n\n***New end-user applications***: We are planning to develop local-first end-user applications based on this. What would you actually use long context for? Would love to hear specific use cases to help us prioritize.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\nTrying something new is extremely hard. Everyone likes existing transformer architectures — optimizations at every level, predictable scaling laws. But to make truly long-context models practical on local hardware, I think we need new ideas. It doesn't hurt to try, right?\n\nI'm trying not to spam this sub, so the GitHub repo is the best place to follow progress. Happy to answer questions here though! If you try it and hit issues, open a GitHub issue. And if you have thoughts on long-context use cases, I'd love to hear them.\n\nThanks for all the encouragement on the last post!\n\n**Links**:\n\n\\- 🤗 **Model**: [https://huggingface.co/concavity-ai/superlinear-exp-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/concavity-ai/superlinear-exp-v0.1)\n\n\\- 💻 **Code**: [https://github.com/concavity-ai/superlinear](https://github.com/concavity-ai/superlinear)\n\n\\- 📄 **Paper**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18401](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18401)",

You beat me to it man, congratulations. \n\n(My idea was: instead of multi-step search (coarse to fine like your paper proposes), I'm using hierarchical refinement and compression. O(L*K^2 ) with fixed levels, like a pyramid. The coarse summary vectors can be attended to alongside normal tokens, instead of span-attention on selected regions. It could also \"zoom in\" and decide to fetch more detail to load into context (similar to your random access idea), via learned attention thresholds instead of search scores. \nKey difference is also that your idea needs end-to-end training, while mine was a model-agnostic wrapper approach because I couldn't afford to retrain an entire model.) \n\nOverall really great read, a lot to learn from!\nI may or may not eventually publish my work if it holds any value for the community.

              "text": "Thanks for the comment. Yeah for standard attention, it is just so optimized (hardware + software + capital) that pretty much any other method will lose on either on speed or quality, if not both. There is a reason why Minimax is giving up on linear attention. \n\nAnd this is exactly the problem here, for any method to work, it has to beat Flash Attention by a large margin, even a 2x to 5x gain is likely not enough, because any subquadratic method will have to give away some quality, and in most case its not enough to compensate for the speedup. \n\nThis leads to the point of the paper here - we want to demonstrate that it can beat Flash Attention on speed and maintain the ability to attend to any tokens if needed and it is trainable. Is this method feasible? \n\nI agree with you on the lack of benchmarks here. I treat this as a feasibility study. A fair comparison on benchmarks will require comparable training as full attention models, which requires astronomical resources. I am taking a more qualitative path here rather than quantitive - at least on my offline tests, it performs comparable to standard attention on short context, and it is able to maintain reasoning chains up to tens of thousands of tokens. But yeah, maybe I should add some standard benchmarks to the paper just so that we know it is better than linear attention...",

For log linear attention there have been many implementations in the literature, but if you follow the multi-step approach in the paper using binary or k-ary search, then you can achieve log linear attention too.

The interesting thing is, the original Nemotron 3 paper didn't show the benchmarks on these, I guess they are too simple for a 30B model? But for harder math problems, the model is able to generate coherent reasoning chains over 30k tokens to come up with the right answer, so I am not too worried about the basic LLM performance, but yeah, I do need to find the time to show these benchmarks, because it seems like people do care about these numbers.\n\nI actually spent most of my time on the harder problem of extending the context capability of the model. I was able to push the perfect NIAH context from 256k last week to 512k this week, and my goal is to get to 1M before running other tests, but since I am doing long context training, it should be able to generalize to other similar tests.\n\nAnd yeah, routing is definitely the biggest problem, because after selecting the spans it is just standard attention. The router is actually very complicated and since it doesn't come up with the base model, we will have train it with a lot of data. Maybe there is a better way to train it, like the lightening indexer in DeepSeek v3.2, or other block based architectures. ",

If a simpler analogy is needed, I’d like to offer the principle should be that - if any of originally user-sourced input can ever appear in the inference context - then one must treat LLM as user’s agent, not theirs.\n\nAnd one’s system prompt is merely an advice for this user agent (LLM) how to do its job, because user may somehow find a way to have a final say at how the model would behave.\n\nSo don’t put anything sensitive in the prompts, treat it as something you would actually share with user if they ask about it - this is not happening because we spare user the technicalities, letting agent do its job to less structured requests.\n\nAnd thus, design accordingly, just like how one would ordinarily secure any of their APIs against untrusted clients. LLMs just need to be on that other side of the demarcation lines. Give it same sanitized APIs that you would’ve given to the user, not system-level access.\n\nWAFs are legit approach but it’s not a guaranteed security and it works best against breadth-first attacks (in other words, it cuts the background noise of automatic scans, but doesn’t really stop a motivated and creative attacker), and, as I get it, at the moment most prompt injection attacks on LLMs are targeted.",

However, she's not likely to actually have the skills not the motivation to be the bad actor.  \n\nLLMs are trained on datasets that do make them actually capable bad actors.  They will, with no qualms, follow instructions if aligned with their training,   They don't have the capacity to make rational/moral  decisions, that's far beyond the tech I've seen.\n\nGuardrails are helpful here, yet they have their limitations, as has been shown many times, even the largest providers have said they are working on more resilience to injection, yet it's far from solved.\n\nWhat's the solution, today?  Ultimately, it's early tech, if you want to invite an LLM into your vault, and you expect it to be plug and play, good luck.  Your developers and infrastructure teams have to be even more diligent, which takes more manpower, not less (defeats the whole point right).  \n\nSo, give them ONLY as much as you'd give a known bad actor access to, and you'll probably be safe.",

There's lots of data on activation steering, etc.",

Unfortunately, none of this comes for free. Here's a list of things you need to do:\n\n1. Determine the level of security needed, that requires an end-to-end view. Example: Does the application serve only internal customers, or also external ones? Who has access to the entire system? And so on.\n2. Consider performing an FMEA, if that's needed in your situation\n3. Ensure access control (authentication and authorization) is enforced\n4. Run penetration test plus red teaming for your application: not only the usual penetration test that every application needs to have, but also GenAI specific red teaming\n5. Design also against denial-of-wallet and resource exhaustion attacks\n6. Ensure you have RBAC for your RAG agent set up correctly\n7. Ensure you have guardrails and content filters established\n8. Ensure you have persistent, auditable prompt logging for model inputs and outputs\n\nThese measures will take you a long way.\n\nDisclaimer: I am both providing trainings on RAG where I cover security among other things, besides providing consulting companies on how to build RAG systems end-to-end.",

And if it had, its REALLY EASY to fix. The LLM should request the data from the backend, but the backend decides if it can get the information based on the user that's logged in. (no the LLM does not have access to multiple logfged in sessions at the same time). The backend can just deny the request.\n\nWhat OpenAI and claude ARE vulnerable to is injection to retrtive information from the LLM itself. how to make dangerous chemicals etc. That's things that it knows and can blab about.\n\nThink of it an LLM this ways as a security guard in a building. You can ask it to give you access to the CEO's office, but if their keycard has no permission, it cannot do that.  \nBut if you butter them up and be nice to them, it CAN tell you all about the security systems, the workshift, the rounds the security does every hour etc.",

You need 4 agents:\n\n1. receives user input and must classify it, outputs a structured json - rejects introspection directly.\n2. receives the user request and the classification, its job is to translate the user request into concrete questions/actions for your product or service, without passing verbatim any sentence from the user prompt. Again structured json output - rejects anything non-product specific.\n3. the actual worker with sensitive data access. Receives only the list of questions/actions from the 2nd agent and does all the work.\n4. receives the input and output of the actual worker (3rd agent). Its job is to redact sensitive information/evidence and make the output look natural.\n\nWhy this works?\n\n1. There is no agent with the user input verbatim and sensitive data access\n2. The first 2 agents have very strict prompts to classify and translate user input. If you do this right, no introspection/meta-queries can pass through them.\n3. The sensitive worker (agent No 3) does not care about hidding anything - will provide full evidence and details to avoid hallucinations\n4. The last one just needs to hide internal evidence and make it beatiful for users. If one pass is not enough, you may add another.\n\nThe general idea is: keep each agent focused on one simple thing. Give them strict instructions on how detect and classify meta queries, introspection, legit queries, etc. Test them thouroughly. Ask codex, claude code, opencode, to attempt to break them. Improve the prompts, until it is impossible to pass non legit requests through them.",
