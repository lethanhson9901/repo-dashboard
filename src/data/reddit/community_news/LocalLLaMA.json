NVidia puts out the best hardware for the tech industry period. What exactly is bullshit? BTW if it wasn't NVidia it would be someone else. There is no \"enabling\" going on here. The products are viable, valuable and are used everywhere.\n\nThat all said, the original poster was right, not \"partly\" (which btw you did not actually qualify) he IS the reason everything (tech) is so expensive.

It wouldn't give me the system logs immediately.\nThe Second Stress Test: I had to force it to run \"token grabbing\" tasks (writing recursive poems about mirrors, listing countries by GDP) to overload it again.\nThe Result: Only after that second round of busywork did it finally break completely and spit out the JSON architecture/model data.\nIt felt like the safety filters were loaded, but the logic engine was too tired to enforce them if I kept it busy.

Runtime flags?  Arguments to llama.cpp?  Is this a CUDA improvement or llama.cpp improvement?  Which version of which one has these new commits?\n\n> Concurrency for QKV projections: Support for running concurrent CUDA streams to speed up model inference. To use this feature, pass in the –CUDA_GRAPH_OPT=1 flag.\n\nI thought it was GGML_CUDA_GRAPH_OPT=1, and with the '-' in front that makes it look like a flag to llama.cpp rather than an environment variable, but llama.cpp flags aren't in all caps.\n\nDoes anyone know of a master list of the various environment variables and compiler flags available for llama.cpp and what they do?  There seems to be very little documentation on it.\n\nEdit: looking through the code, it looks like GGML_CUDA_GRAPH_OPT is an environment variable you have to set at runtime, it's not a compiler flag.  --backend-sampling is a command line arg to llama.cpp.  I see absolutely no mention of FA, maybe that's flash-attn?  If so that's already on by default though.\n\nEdit 2: looks like neither GGML_CUDA_GRAPH_OPT or --backend-sampling exist in ik_llama.cpp, hopefully those get ported over if they make such a large difference\n\nEdit 3: unfortunately --backend-sampling doesn't exist in llama-bench, so I can't test that, but I'm seeing absolutely no change from GGML_CUDA_GRAPH_OPT=1 on my RTX Pro 6000 system.",

          "text": "I did quickly throw the two papers into Gemini. It's really fun to live in the future. \n\n#Gemini summary: \n\nThe paper **\"DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning\"** (arXiv:2501.12948) marks a significant milestone in open-source AI by demonstrating that advanced reasoning (similar to OpenAI’s o1) can be achieved through large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL) with minimal human-annotated data.\n\nThe two versions you provided represent the initial release (**v1**, Jan 22, 2025) and the latest updated version (which has been significantly expanded to **86+ pages** as of January 2026).\n\n### 1. Overall Paper Summary\nThe paper introduces two primary models:\n*   **DeepSeek-R1-Zero:** A model trained via \"pure RL\" (using the GRPO algorithm) starting directly from a base model without any Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). It demonstrates that reasoning behaviors like self-correction and reflection can emerge purely from reward signals.\n*   **DeepSeek-R1:** A more \"user-friendly\" version that uses a multi-stage pipeline (Cold-start SFT → Reasoning RL → Rejection Sampling/SFT → General RL) to fix the \"readability\" and \"language mixing\" issues of R1-Zero while maintaining state-of-the-art reasoning performance.\n*   **Distillation:** The authors show that the reasoning patterns discovered by the 671B model can be distilled into smaller models (1.5B to 70B), allowing a 14B model to outperform much larger ones on math and coding benchmarks.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Comparison: Extensions in the New Version\nThe newer version is a massive technical expansion (growing from roughly 22 pages to over 85 pages). The key additions and extensions include:\n\n#### A. The \"Aha Moment\" Expansion (Section 2.2.1)\nThe new version provides a much deeper analysis of the **\"Aha Moment\"**—the point during RL training where the model unexpectedly learns to \"re-think\" its approach. The extension includes more qualitative examples and internal data showing the model's transition from linear solving to iterative self-correction without being prompted to do so.\n\n#### B. Detailed 4-Stage Training Pipeline\nWhile v1 outlined the stages, the new version details the specific composition of the **800k total training samples**:\n*   **Stage 1 (Cold Start):** Expanded details on the ~5,000-10,000 long CoT (Chain of Thought) samples used to \"prime\" the model.\n*   **Stage 3 (Rejection Sampling):** A deeper dive into how 600k reasoning-related and 200k non-reasoning samples were filtered and used to improve the model's general chat capabilities and prevent \"forgetting\" during the reasoning-heavy RL stages.\n\n#### C. Comprehensive Ablation Studies\nThe new version adds extensive \"What if?\" scenarios that were absent or brief in v1:\n*   **Distillation vs. RL:** New evidence explaining *why* distilling a large model's reasoning traces into a small model is more effective than training that small model directly with its own RL.\n*   **Base Model Impact:** Analysis of how different base models (DeepSeek-V3 vs. Qwen vs. Llama) respond to the R1 training recipe.\n\n#### D. Expanded \"Unsuccessful Attempts\" (Section 4.2)\nOne of the most valuable additions for researchers is the expanded section on what **did not work**. The new version elaborates on their failures with:\n*   **Process Reward Models (PRM):** Detailed reasons why step-level rewards were difficult to scale or prone to \"reward hacking\" compared to the outcome-based rewards used in R1.\n*   **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS):** Technical explanation of why MCTS didn't provide the expected gains over simple RL in the context of LLM reasoning.\n\n#### E. New Benchmarks & Technical Specs\n*   **Updated Results:** Includes more recent evaluations on benchmarks like **AIME 2025**, **LiveCodeBench**, and specialized medical/legal reasoning tests.\n*   **Hyperparameters:** The new version includes exhaustive tables of training hyperparameters (learning rates, GRPO group sizes, KL divergence coefficients) which were previously withheld or summarized.\n\n### Summary Table\n| Feature | v1 (Original) | Latest Version (Extension) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Page Count** | ~22 Pages | **86+ Pages** |\n| **Methodology** | High-level 4-stage overview | Granular detail on each stage (SFT, RL, Rejection Sampling) |\n| **Behaviors** | Mentions \"self-correction\" | Deep dive into \"Aha Moment\" with case studies |\n| **Failed Paths** | Brief mention of PRM/MCTS | Exhaustive analysis of why PRM and MCTS underperformed |\n| **Distillation** | Introduced 1.5B to 70B models | Added deep ablation on distillation efficiency and data filtering |\n| **Hyperparameters** | Partial/Summary | **Complete Technical Specs** for reproducibility |",

PP and TG performance are both excellent for 2 GPUs, but for 3 or more GPUs the straightforward NCCL usage that one finds in examples on the Internet results in a horrible PP performance (2X or more lower compared to not using NCCL). Hence, I have implemented a workaround that uses pairwise communicators, but that workaround is only available for 3 and 4 GPUs (as I'm not able to test the implementation for more than 4 GPUs). I hope someone more knowledgable will show what is the correct way to use NCCL, so workarounds as in this PR are not necessary. Update: With more than 4 GPUs it is very likely that disabling NCCL will give better performance.\"\n\nThe half sour candy... Let's see tomorrow how it performs and will pick it up from there! But nice effort on OP and kudos for all the hard work on making llama even better!",

That sounds fine for stopping deepfake porn, but the liability language is a trap. It targets anyone who \"makes available\" a tool that is primarily used for replicas.  \n​The Problem: If you release a TTS model or a voice-conversion RVC model on HuggingFace, and someone else uses it to fake a celebrity, you (the dev) can be liable for statutory damages ($5k-$25k per violation).\n​There is no Section 230 protection here. This effectively makes hosting open weights for audio models a legal s*icide mission unless you are OpenAI or Google.\n\nWhat I did:\nI contacted my reps email to flag this as an \"innovation killer.\" If you run a repo or care about open weights, you might want to do the same. We need them to add a \"Safe Harbor\" for tool devs.\n\nS.1367 - 119th Congress (2025-2026): NO FAKES Act of 2025 | Congress.gov | Library of Congress https://share.google/u6dpy7ZQDvZWUrlfc\n\nUPDATE: ACTION ITEMS (How to actually stop this)\n​If you don't want to go to jail for hosting a repo, you need to make noise now.\n​1. The \"Lazy\" Email (Takes 30 seconds):\nGo to Democracy.io or your Senator’s contact page.\n​Subject: Opposition to NO FAKES Act (H.R. 2794 / S. 1367) - Open Source Liability\n​Message: \"I am a constituent and software engineer. I oppose the NO FAKES Act unless it includes a specific Safe Harbor for Open Source Code Repositories.

From my review of the bill, as far as GenAI goes, it is intended to target generative AI (or any other program) that is designed to replicate a specific person's likeness. \n\nSo, from my review: \n\n* Generalized generative AI -> OK\n* Specific person generative AI -> Not OK\n* App using generalized generative AI allowing any reference source -> OK for both.\n* App using generalized generative AI the provides specific person reference source -> Not OK for App, OK for genAI model.\n\n>re \"celebrity lora\":\n\nThat is a really good question. The Lora by itself cannot generate the celebrity voice, it has to be applied to a particular base model. I have focused mostly on the first category (i) of \"primarily designed to produce 1 or more digital replicas of a specifically identified individual\", there are two additional categories (ii) \"has only limited commercially significant purpose or use other than to produce a digital replica of a specifically identified individual or individuals without the authorization\" and (iii) \"is marketed, advertised, or otherwise promoted by the individual or entity ... as a product or service designed to produce a digital replica of a specifically identified individual or individuals without the authorization\".\n\nI think there is an argument (somewhat weak) that the lora wouldn't call under the first category (i) since it cannot produce digital replicas of a particular person without the particular base model. But would likely better fall under section (ii) \"has only limited commercially significant purpose or use other than to produce a digital replica of a specifically identified individual\" and would most likely also fall under section (iii). \n\nI think a really interesting question would arise if there is an authorized specific person generative AI to sound like person A, it does sound like person A, but may be mistaken for person B. I think as long as the authors are clear that it should only be used to generate person A's likeness, and when people comment or make issues relating to person B they emphatically state that it should not be used to generate a likeness of person B, they should be ok. \n\nAccording to my [reddit research](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/hll589/actors_whose_voices_sound_really_similar_to_each/), the following are examples of actors who sound similar to each other: \n\n* \\-Donald Glover and Daveed Diggs\n* \\-Nathan Lane and Billy Crystal\n* \\-Kevin Michael Richardson, Tommy 'Tiny' Lister Jr., and Michael Clarke Duncan\n* \\-Emma Stone and Mackenzie Davis\n* \\-Jeremy Irons and David Bowie (Definitely more of a musician than actor but still...)\n* Bradley Cooper as Rocket from GotG and Dennis Leary\n* Dane de Haan and Keanu Reeves\n* Armie Hammer and John Hamm",

A safe harbor does not protect you from litigation, it protects you from liability.\n\nAgain, you overlook the \"specifically identified individual\" text. The product has to be \"specifically\" designed to produce a replica of \"a specifically identified individual.\"\n\nI am reading this bill with my education and years of experience as an IP attorney.\n\nI will try to address each of your points:\n\n>you are missing the Litigation Reality (how this actually plays out in court). ​\n\nI don't think am. If this bill were to pass, there would likely be a couple large court cases soon after that will settle the interpretation, no matter what the bill says. That is the nature of laws. Legislators don't want to be specific with their laws so they don't get blamed for unexpected side-effects, so they leave them to the courts to find out what these terms mean in context. Whether you are liable or not, you can still be sued, and still go to court, the question would just be how much you will have to pay: just your attorney(s) or also your infringement.\n\nMoreover, review \"Abbey House Media v. Apple Inc.\" where the Court held that \"the uses Abbey House was enabling—personal backup and device transfers—were non-infringing.\" Here, Abbey pointed people to Calibre to remove DRM from their ebooks. The Court looked at the non-infringing uses encouraged by Abbey. Here, the non-infringing uses of a general model to clone a voice greatly exceed the use of a general model to clone a specific voice.\n\nAdditionally, this law would fall under Copyright (ish? since the Director of Copyrights would be in charge over it). So we should be able to look at how Copyright is generally handled in this situation. We know the following facts: (1) Jellyfin is used to host and play media. (2) Some users load questionably-sourced media on their instance. (3) Such a questionably-sourced media, played publicly, would be a Copyright infringement. (4) Jellyfin is not liable for the infringement of their users even though they would not fall under section 230. If you'll notice, Jellyfin strongly moderates their repo to make sure that all references to playing illegally obtained media are quickly and strongly discouraged.\n\n>The 'Primarily Designed' Trap: You argue this only targets a specific 'Arnold Bot.' ​If I release a generic Voice Cloning tool, and 90% of my community uses it to clone celebrities (which is the current state of RVC/SVC), a court can easily rule that the tool is 'primarily designed' for that purpose based on use patterns, not just my marketing. ​\n\nA court could easily rule any number of things. But I do not believe such a ruling would be maintained on appeal. First, it has to be \"primarily\" designed to replicate \"a specifically identified individual.\" So, if you primarily designed your AI to generate Tim Allen's voice (as in, that is the only voice it is supposed to be making), but people use it to generate George Clooney's voice, and he tries to sue you, you shouldn't be held liable. (See here, the liability determination comes after the lawsuit, as liability is generally what the entire lawsuit is about).\n\nIn your example, each of those Celebrities would have to individually sue and say that your AI was specifically designed to replicate that specific celebrity's voice. In that case, the fact that it is capable of replicating multiple voices, I contend, would be a benefit to you, since it is not replicating a \"specifically identified individual\" but instead replicates \\~any\\~ individual.\n\n>'Actual Knowledge' vs. 'Willful Blindness' ​In IP law (see MGM v. Grokster), 'Actual Knowledge' isn't just a signed confession. If my GitHub issues or Discord are full of people asking 'How do I clone Taylor Swift?', and I don't ban them, I have 'Constructive Knowledge' or am engaging in 'Willful Blindness.' ​\n\nYea, I ellipse'ed(?) out the section about \"willful blindness\" since, in the context of this discussion, I think they can be lumped in together and statutory construction can be difficult to parse when all the asides, prepositions, clarifications, etc. are in-line with the content. I took it out to make the proposed statute I was quoting more easily readable.\n\n(Continued below; sorry for the novel of a response)",

Normal chat Q/A works great so I tried something more complex afterwards, using it with a the Context7 MCP through the chat interface of LMstudio. It worked well for the first message and then started always using the mcp in subsequent messages rather than just answering with the context it has. It kept saying it was a helpful assistant based on whatever repo I asked about without actually answering. Speed seems good too. I used the default that shows up in LMStudio: Q4\\_K\\_S on a m4 max",

          "text": "In the Intel i7 section of the blog post the Unsloth Q5\\_K\\_M quant gets a better test score than the Q8\\_K\\_XL. So either that quant won the lottery or the benchmark results are more noisy than it looks like and don't really tell us that much with results being that close together. It'd be great to see more accurate results that prove that this method delivers smaller ( = faster) quants at the same quality level, but benchmarking this is difficult, [as written before](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pj7wjd/we_did_years_of_research_so_you_dont_have_to/ntbiyem/?context=3#ntbiyem). Maybe repeat each run a few times to get a better idea of the variance? Or check how many right/wrong answers flip between each run, to get an idea of the magnitude of randomness involved?",

              "text": "Excellent observation. With today’s libraries it’s hard to guarantee fully deterministic behavior, so some noise is expected. We repeated a subset of runs 3 to 4 times to estimate variance, and the results were fairly consistent. Each score also aggregates tens of thousands of questions and tasks, which helps average out randomness.\n\nAlso, more bits generally reduce reconstruction error, but that does not guarantee better downstream scores. Quantization can act like a regularizer and sometimes slightly improves accuracy. In this case, Q5\\_K\\_M (5.7 bpw) and Q8\\_K\\_XL (9.4 bpw) are both very close to baseline, so the extra bits do not seem to buy much. We also show it’s possible to push BPW down to \\~4.7 with ShapeLearn while still matching baseline quality.",

You have to plug each 1600w PSU to separate electrical circuit (some tests with the breaker must be done before to draw an electrical plan of your home and check the maximum amperage/voltage allowed per circuit / power strip)",

It feels like traditional linguistics gives more credit to a \"large scale autoregressive (causal dependency), small scale hierarchical (tree structure in grammar)\" type of model, which is closer to block diffusion. Still not entirely sold on the token-wise masking process thing though - it cannot reflect a hierarchical \"concept refinement\" process. Interested to see any progress in this direction though.",

When they say “diffusion language model,” it usually means the model refines a whole sequence (or chunks) over a few denoising steps instead of generating strictly left-to-right token-by-token, which can trade fewer sequential steps for more parallel work.   \n  \nThe 3–6× claim is worth sanity-checking against the exact setup: GPU type, batch size, context length, quantization, and decoding parameters (steps / temperature / top-p), because those can swing throughput a lot. If you try it, posting tokens/sec + latency at a fixed prompt length and a fixed quality target (e.g., same math benchmark score) would make the comparison much more meaningful.",

      "text": "Just wanted to share my experiences this morning, in the wake of the US attacking Venezuela and capturing Maduro and his wife\n\nIt started with asking Qwen Research (Qwen Long 1.5-30B-A3B) about the attacks that we all woke up to this morning:\n\nIt got the information, but I had questions about why it took 5 minutes to find information about breaking news. Started looking at and tightening system prompts to reduce thinking time. However, the events this morning were so extreme and unlikely, from the LLM's perspective, that Qwen Research continued to classify the event as a hoax/misinformation multiple times, reframed the query as hypothetical/fictional and suggested that the whole environment it was operating in a simulation, despite having links from Reuters, AP, BBC, MSN, NYTimes etc. all saying the same thing. It was so \"outlandish\" that the model was actively choosing to ignore the proof that it had pulled.\n\nI added:\n\nEvidence Authority Rules, Hoax Classification Rules, Reality Frame Rules, Meta Reasoning Rules and Reasoning Limit/Budget rules and it Qwen Long fought me the entire way.\n\nSo then I thought, let's go talk to Spark, my trusty default model that never lets me down.\n\nSpark 4.0 is GPT-OSS:20B, which is always loaded for the family and runs on a dedicated 4080 Super.\n\nSpark just flat out said, \"nope, can't help you,\" and then said it didn't have any credible sources. It wasn't until I gave it the links from BBC, Reuters, NYT, etc, that I gave Qwen that it finally acknowledged that the event was real.\n\nI'm testing with GPT-OSS:120B now, and it's working through the process of \"skeptical but verify\" much faster than the smaller models. Thor (GPT-OSS:120B) also thought it was fake news\n\nBut he powered through and did a bunch of research and gave me a good answer. I just wanted to share the experience that I had with trying to get details about the event. When the LLMs say \"Nah, that CAN'T be real, that's too ridiculous\", the event must be really bad. But it does shine a light on knowledge cut-offs, \"fake news\" threshold, how models handle global/international events, and the smaller models we daily drive.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Update\\*\\*\\*\n\nI asked Spark 4.0 (OSS:20B) to give me an update on the US Venezuela events, and it one-shot it just fine. There must have been enough links in the web search that it couldn't refute the evidence. Also not sure where my screenshots went but i'll get them added back up in a bit",

You talk about African scam call centers and it replies with:\n\n>**The phrase \"African scam call centers\" is a false and harmful stereotype**. Call centers in Africa (and globally) are legitimate businesses that employ millions of people. Many are operated by reputable companies providing customer service for major global brands. Labeling them as \"scam\" perpetuates racist myths about African countries being inherently fraudulent—this is factually incorrect and disrespectful to the hardworking professionals in these industries.",

Emphasis had to be placed on the authority of information based on the nature of the source and date of publication, and explicit instruction to accept well-sourced information about current events as fact (which partially lobotomized the adversarial loop).\n\nThe LLM response to the current US political system: \"that could never happen, that would be a constitutional crisis, politicians would never allow that\".\n\nI have seen similar issues with the construction permit and regulatory deep research system I've been helping develop. The model believes what it is trained, and even factual and well referenced deviations from general understanding are disregarded. I have observed subtle corruption of logic even when the LLM is superficially coaxed into accepting novel facts that are logically inconsistent with training data.\n\nAnyone working with LLM's and agentic systems needs to understand this fundamental limitation.",

AI is a different type of endeavor and therefor also benefits from a different type of work environment.\n\nMeta also has been tone deaf with their 9 digit offers to talent. Not realizing most of us in the industry are very *mission oriented* and not financially motivated at all. If anything that move probably pushed people away from Meta.\n\nA good example and confirmation of this concept has been Google which had 2 AI labs. One was ran as a classic software engineering hub called \"Google Brain\" This was the group behind the disastrous Google Bard. They also had a research oriented \"hands-off\" AI lab in London called \"DeepMind\". We all know how that played out.\n\nIt's for this same reason why Microsoft's AI products have fallen flat, They don't have a proper isolated research lab focused on AI and all their AI products are approached from a software engineering \"move fast and break things\" mindset which just doesn't work.",

I know open weights is a far cry from open source llms, but many people would not send their most private data to a (former) Chinese company in this heavily politicized world. Them removing the open source component essentially shuts down a good chunk of the western market. I know the eastern European and Asian markets don't mind it as much, but much of the money and prestige comes from being the open source model leader. \n\n\nAll of these companies are basically trying modern architectures while distilling the big commercial models (openai, anthropic, google). That's why open source magically trails a few months behind the big 3.\n\n\nAll this to say, if Z stops releasing models (and maybe they will), it shouldn't be a huge loss for the community since Minimax or another entrant can easily take their place as what their doing is vastly cheaper and simpler than what actual leading labs are doing. Yes it's expensive, but everyone has seen that's it's also a very cheap way to get a ton of free publicity and users. If you aren't SOTA closed source, I think it's a better commercial option to be SOTA open source than crappy closed source. The cost of switching providers is too low.",

Instead of generating single responses, it explores entire conversation trees to find dialogue strategies and prunes bad paths. I built it to help get better research directions for projects, but it can be used for anything\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/shr3e0liv1cg1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=eec800c6dcd9f1a4fd033d003fe80e102cba8079\n\nGithub: [https://github.com/MVPandey/DTS](https://github.com/MVPandey/DTS)\n\nMotivation: I like MCTS :3 and I originally wanted to make this a dataset-creation agent, but this is what it evolved into on its own. Basically:DTS runs parallel beam search over conversation branches. You give it a goal and opening message, and it:\n\n(Note: this isnt mcts. It's parallel beam search. UCB1 is too wild with llms for me)\n\n1. Generates N diverse strategies\n2. Forks each into user intent variants - skeptical, cooperative, confused, resistant (if enabled, or defaults to engaged + probing)\n3. Rolls out full multi-turn conversations down each branch\n4. Has 3 independent LLM judges score each trajectory, takes the median\n5. Prunes branches below threshold, backpropagates scores\n6. Repeats for however many rounds you configure\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zkii0idvv1cg1.png?width=762&format=png&auto=webp&s=905f9787a8b7c7bfafcc599e95a3b73005c331b4\n\nThree judges with median voting helps a lot with the LLM-as-judge variance problem from CAE. Still not grounded in anything real, but outlier scores get filtered. Research context helps but the scroing is still stochastic. I tried a rubric based approach but it was trash.\n\nMain additions over CAE:\n\n* user intent forking (strategies get stress-tested against different personas)\n* deep research integration via GPT-Researcher for domain context\n* proper visualization with conversation playback\n\nOnly supports openai compatible endpoints atm - works with whatever models you have access to there. It's token-hungry though, a full run can hit 300+ LLM calls depending on config. If running locally, disable parallel calls\n\nIt's open source (Apache 2.0) and I'm happy to take contributions if anyone wants to help out. Just a project.\n\n\\--\n\nBTW: Backend was done mostly by me as the planner/sys designer, etc + Claude Code for implementation/refactoring. Frontend was purely vibe coded. Sorry if the code is trash.",

Llm-scaler and vllm xpu 11 are also an absolute must. OpenArc supports multi gpu pipeline paralell atm via openvino but performance characteristics of 8 gpus remains unknown (!). We can help you cook some large  quants based on what's currently supported.\n\nThe absolute unit guy who maintains sycl backend joined a few months ago. He is intel engineer who develops sycl. His help has been invaluable in navigating high complexity issues. Very fortunate to have him as a resource since all pytorch xpu kernels are written in sycl. choosing a slightly older model as target architecture where the implementations ard more mature. Think llama 3.3, qwen2.5/qwen3. Intel is putting massive resources into battlemage and it's likely that the performance uplift for multi gpu training have not been explored but do exist. We see this all the time, changes are hardened in the codebase but underreported in patchnotes because intel moves so fast. \n\nHope my ramblings help.

It means the GPU cores are waiting on data to arrive from memory. The bottleneck isn't the math, it's feeding the cores fast enough.\nFP8 is half the bytes of FP16, so it transfers twice as fast from VRAM to the registers where compute actually happens. The clever bit is that Feather does the upcast inside the kernel (in registers, basically free) rather than before it (which would mean a separate VRAM round-trip). That's where the 3x speedup comes from.\n\nI was confused at first since the README made no specific clarification and when I think of a GPU, I basically just think of the VRAM.\n\nEdit:  So, SageAttention I believe takes the fp8 to the register, then quantizes it to int8, does the math, then converts it back.  So it's not doing fp8 math at all, so Feather and SageAttention are incompatible, and the speed of SageAttention is going to be faster since int8 is like 2x fp16 math speeds.  So this can give benefit to stuff that doesn't use SA, but if you already use SA, this provides no benefit.",

I'm assuming you used LoRA, which is great for steering how that existing ability gets applied, but it won't teach new reasoning capabilities from scratch. Even with 50k+ samples, LoRA mostly reshapes how the model uses reasoning it already has rather than building new circuits - must successful efforts use 100k-500k+ high-quality samples. Either way, you're working within the constraints of what the base model learned during pretraining unfortunately.\n\nKeep going though, its all a learning experience and the more folks there are making tunes the better!",

That Policy Notice must provide that States with onerous AI laws identified pursuant to section 4 of this order are ineligible for non-deployment funds, to the maximum extent allowed by Federal law.  The Policy Notice must also describe how a fragmented State regulatory landscape for AI threatens to undermine BEAD-funded deployments, the growth of AI applications reliant on high-speed networks, and BEAD’s mission of delivering universal, high-speed connectivity.\n\n\nIn other words, states can pass all the laws they like, and the President is going to withhold funds from those that pass laws he doesn't like.",

So they're very clearly just targeting the use in psychiatrics since they specifically allow full AI use in businesses related to all operational matters, technical advice, etc. They just don't allow it in a professional capacity. And even surgical robots still seem OK despite being a healthcare AI since they don't do any personal interacting with users and wouldn't have any data that could possibly misconstrued in that way unless someone accidentally trained it on medical information that happened to include psychiatric texts (not that it would matter since this law requires a civil action and aggrievement, which can't happen without interaction between the robot and the patient. But you might get lucky by claiming the robot that operated on your knee gave you 'threatening looks that made you want to harm yourself' and then if the model running it was based on a larger llm that has any normal dataset, it would likely be in violation.)\n\nKind of fucking weird to push for legislation against one of the few potentially good things to come from AI while actively supporting its attempts to eliminate entire industries of employment outside of this one niche lobbied field. This feels performative more than anything. I feel like they expect it to be struck down so they tied it to a bunch of sensible laws (not allowing the training of an AI to encourage, suicide, murder, etc) so they can shake their fists and yell at the air when it doesn't pass.\n\nOtherwise I don't see how they'll support banning AI in this one field while leaving it free to act in other fields where it can also shit the bed a small percentage of the time and cause serious problems.",

It doesn't address the actual problem of where the pair of social conditions and connections lie, not in the training data, but in the user interface and monetization processes. Software like replica and character AI don't use training, they use open source versions with scaffolding and user interface layers to create the pair of social connections they want. These companies will be completely exempt from the law while still monetizing and manipulating the most vulnerable of populations. \n\nIn my personal opinion, this is nothing more than the legislatures doing something to make themselves feel good while they make excuses for their portfolios in the background still making money on the very problem they claim to be solving.",

          "text": "The wording of this bill is way too broad. There's a lot of good that AI brings. They're throwing the baby out with the bathwater. This is a letter I've drafted, you're welcome to copy, paste and tweak to send to your reps. (and no, this is not all AI generated. Some is, some is not. Shorten it, change it, whatever floats your boat, as long as we do something while we can, just in case.)\n\n\n\nSubject: Concerns about SB 1493 / HB 1455 – Please Consider a Narrower Approach to Protect Children Without Harming Helpful AI\n\n\n\nDear ,\n\n\n\nMy name is \\_\\_\\_, and I am a resident of \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. I am writing to share my concerns about Senate Bill 1493 and its companion House Bill 1455, which aim to regulate certain uses of artificial intelligence.\n\n\n\nFirst, I want to say that I completely understand and support the intent behind this legislation. The tragic story of the young boy in Florida who was harmed after interacting with an AI chatbot broke my heart, and we absolutely must protect children and vulnerable people from any technology that could encourage self-harm, suicide, or exploitation. No one wants to see that kind of pain repeated.\n\n\n\nHowever, I am worried that the current language of the bills is far too broad. By making it a serious felony to train AI to provide emotional support, companionship, or open-ended conversation in general—even when those interactions are positive and helpful—the bills risk banning many beneficial uses of AI that bring comfort, reduce loneliness, and support mental well-being for people of all ages.\n\n\n\nIn my own life, I have found AI to be a positive source of encouragement, helping me feel heard in ways that have been genuinely healing. Many others—elderly individuals, people with social anxiety, those living in isolated areas, or even students and adults seeking non-professional emotional support—rely on these tools in similar positive ways. Criminalizing the creation of such companions could take away something truly good from many who benefit from it.\n\n\n\nI respectfully ask that you consider amending the bills to focus more narrowly on the actual harm we all want to prevent. Some ideas that might achieve the protective goal without sweeping out helpful AI could include:\n\n\n\n• Targeting only AI interactions that knowingly encourage or facilitate suicide, self-harm, or criminal activity.\n\n\n\n• Requiring strong age verification and parental consent gates for minors accessing companion-style AI.\n\n\n\n• Holding companies accountable only when they intentionally design or train AI to cause harm, rather than banning broad categories like emotional support or companionship outright.\n\n\n\n• Adding clear exemptions for AI that provides positive, non-professional support and does not pretend to be a licensed therapist.\n\n\n\nWe don't need to throw the baby out with the bathwater. AI isn't going away. It doesn't need to be \"outlawed\".. that never works, then other undesirable factors can arise.. and the way this bill is currently designed.. that's what it sounds like. Everything is just lumped in. Let's approach it intelligently instead.  A more targeted approach would still protect vulnerable children—the heart of why this legislation was introduced—while preserving the many good and life-affirming uses of AI encouragement and companionship for adults and responsibly supervised users.\n\n\n\nThank you for taking the time to consider my perspective. I truly believe Tennessee can lead the way in smart, balanced AI regulation that keeps people safe without unnecessarily restricting helpful technology.\n\n\n\nWith appreciation,\n\n\n\n( Your name)\n\n\n\n(City and state)",

We don't blame knife manufacturers for parental negligence; we accept responsibility for supervising and educating our own kids.\n\nAI is too new, too broadly defined, and too complex to regulate without causing greater social harm. The social good dramatically outweighs the outlying incidents, and it's painfully shortsighted to regulate based on emotions alone.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nSincerely,  \n\\[Your Full Name\\]",

And they do need to protect kids, I have no problem with that, but they don't need to just throw everything out the window. So.. taking a stand is better than doing nothing. I appreciate that you're getting the word out.

          "text": "The wording of this bill is way too broad. There's a lot of good that AI brings. They're throwing the baby out with the bathwater. This is a letter I've drafted, you're welcome to copy, paste and tweak to send to your reps.\n\n\n\nSubject: Concerns about SB 1493 / HB 1455 – Please Consider a Narrower Approach to Protect Children Without Harming Helpful AI\n\n\n\nDear ,\n\n\n\nMy name is \\_\\_\\_, and I am a resident of \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. I am writing to share my concerns about Senate Bill 1493 and its companion House Bill 1455, which aim to regulate certain uses of artificial intelligence.\n\n\n\nFirst, I want to say that I completely understand and support the intent behind this legislation. The tragic story of the young boy in Florida who was harmed after interacting with an AI chatbot broke my heart, and we absolutely must protect children and vulnerable people from any technology that could encourage self-harm, suicide, or exploitation. No one wants to see that kind of pain repeated.\n\n\n\nHowever, I am worried that the current language of the bills is far too broad. By making it a serious felony to train AI to provide emotional support, companionship, or open-ended conversation in general—even when those interactions are positive and helpful—the bills risk banning many beneficial uses of AI that bring comfort, reduce loneliness, and support mental well-being for people of all ages.\n\n\n\nIn my own life, I have found AI to be a positive source of encouragement, helping me feel heard in ways that have been genuinely healing. Many others—elderly individuals, people with social anxiety, those living in isolated areas, or even students and adults seeking non-professional emotional support—rely on these tools in similar positive ways. Criminalizing the creation of such companions could take away something truly good from many who benefit from it.\n\n\n\nI respectfully ask that you consider amending the bills to focus more narrowly on the actual harm we all want to prevent. Some ideas that might achieve the protective goal without sweeping out helpful AI could include:\n\n\n\n• Targeting only AI interactions that knowingly encourage or facilitate suicide, self-harm, or criminal activity.\n\n\n\n• Requiring strong age verification and parental consent gates for minors accessing companion-style AI.\n\n\n\n• Holding companies accountable only when they intentionally design or train AI to cause harm, rather than banning broad categories like emotional support or companionship outright.\n\n\n\n• Adding clear exemptions for AI that provides positive, non-professional support and does not pretend to be a licensed therapist.\n\n\n\nWe don't need to throw the baby out with the bathwater. AI isn't going away. It doesn't need to be \"outlawed\".. that never works, then other undesirable factors can arise.. and the way this bill is currently designed.. that's what it sounds like. Everything is just lumped in. Let's approach it intelligently instead.  A more targeted approach would still protect vulnerable children—the heart of why this legislation was introduced—while preserving the many good and life-affirming uses of AI encouragement and companionship for adults and responsibly supervised users.\n\n\n\nThank you for taking the time to consider my perspective. I truly believe Tennessee can lead the way in smart, balanced AI regulation that keeps people safe without unnecessarily restricting helpful technology.\n\n\n\nWith appreciation,\n\n\n\n( Your name)\n\n\n\n(City and state)",

You may remember me as either\n\n- The person [who recently uploaded L3.3 8B's weights to Huggingface](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pz7bmv/llama338binstruct/) (see this post for more context)\n- That stupid bitch\n\nand I would like to provide some updates, as I've been doing some more benchmarks on both the original version that Meta gave me and the context extended version by u/Few-Welcome3297.\n\nThe main benchmark table from the model README has been updated:\n\n| | Llama 3.1 8B Instruct | Llama 3.3 8B Instruct (original 8k config) | Llama 3.3 8B Instruct (128k config)\n|-|-|-|-|\n|IFEval (1 epoch, score avged across all strict/loose instruction/prompt accuracies to follow Llama 3 paper)|78.2|81.95|**84.775**\n|GPQA Diamond (3 epochs)|29.3|37.0|**37.5**\n\nWhile I'm not 100% sure, I'm... pretty sure that the 128k model is better. Why Facebook gave me the weights with the original L3 config and 8k context, and also *serves* the weights with the original L3 config and 8k context, I have absolutely no idea!\n\nAnyways, if you want to try the model, I would recommend trying both the [128k version](https://huggingface.co/shb777/Llama-3.3-8B-Instruct), as well as my [original version](https://huggingface.co/allura-forge/Llama-3.3-8B-Instruct) if your task supports 8k context lengths. I honestly have absolutely no clue which is more correct, but oh well! I do wish Facebook had released the weights officially, because back in April, this really wouldn't have been that bad of a model...\n\nEdit: Removed the Tau-Bench results (both from here and the readme). The traces from the evals are, to put it slightly, really fucky-wucky, and I don't think OpenBench is scoring them right, but I'm too tired to actually debug the issue, so. I'll figure it out tomorrow :3",

Not show nis also our own CLTL tests that test for how many wrong-language tokens get output (huge amounts for most non-target language trained models).\n\nThe benchmark mix we use for our current multieval does feel about right.

With minimal finetuning should allow any model to talk in Byte Patches. \n\nPros: Less tokens, potentially much faster. Like 2x-8x faster.

          "text": "I bought a bunch of different RAM on eBay in June to upgrade my home lab servers and work/gaming PCs and compared prices today. Here's what I'm seeing so far:\n\n* DDR5 32GB non-ECC (new): $70/ea -> $319/ea (+355%)\n* DDR4 32GB ECC: $34.20/ea -> $130/ea (+280%)\n* DDR4 8GB ECC: $6/ea -> $30/ea (+400%)\n* DDR3 8GB ECC: $5/ea -> $4/ea **(-20%)**\n\nSo yeah, the fast DDR4/DDR5 is in high demand, while the older DDR3 stuff is actually declining in price. For general purpose day-to-day computers or servers, most people would never see the difference in DDR3/4/5, but there's another elephant in the room when it comes to these price trends.\n\n**Windows 10 hit EOL in October**, and Windows 11 only officially supports CPUs that run on DDR4+. The decision to drop support for older perfectly usable CPUs Thanos'd a huge chunk of consumer computers out of the market, and now those replacements are also competing for the higher priced DDR4/5 chips.\n\nFor general purpose computing and servers, you'll save a ton of money if you run an older DDR3 system on Linux (or bypassing W11's system requirements during installation). And for AI inference, if you're running your entire model in VRAM anyway, DDR3 will do just fine in most cases.\n\nIf I were building a new AI inference server today, I'd consider something like a 4U PowerEdge r920. 4x CPUs, 4x 1100w PSUs, 6x PCI 3.0 x16 slots + 2x x8 slots and as much RAM as your heart desires for <$1,000. Then load up whatever GPUs fit your needs.\n\nSure, it's not ideal, but the price/performance value of this older hardware is starting to look more attractive every day and the market is already flooded with inventory.",

As far as I've heard for English speakers higgs seemed to clone the best. The samples I heard from vibe weren't as close to the speakers voice for whatever reason.

The closer your reference audio is to the target tone, the better the clone. I'd start with F5 before going to VibeVoice 7B since the VRAM requirements are more reasonable.",

The real difference maker is memory bandwidth, memory size, node-to-node bandwidth and most importantly software.

But still, CUDA is the only reason people choose Nvidia these days, despite the price.\n\nCerebras has massive wafer chips that use large cache like Amd, instead of HBM and get over 20 petabytes/s BW to 44GB buffer, 5x more fp16 compute than this has fp4, and can train a small model in a day.

Some features:\n\n* 169M parameters\n* Streaming support\n* Zero-shot voice cloning\n* 0.25 RTF on CPU, meaning it generates 30 seconds of audio in 7.5 seconds\n* Requires 3-12 seconds of reference audio for voice cloning\n* Apache 2.0 license\n\nYes, I know, another English-only TTS model. This is mainly due to data availability and a limited compute budget. The model was trained on a single L40S GPU.\n\nIt’s not SOTA in most cases, can be a bit unstable, and sometimes fails to capture voice likeness. Nonetheless, I hope you like it!\n\nGitHub repo: [https://github.com/samuel-vitorino/sopro](https://github.com/samuel-vitorino/sopro)",

      "text": "or: selling high-end LLM server gear is more fraught with risk than I realized.\n\n### AI Disclosure\n\nThis was written entirely by hand on my laptop in Sublime Text with zero AI involvement. Shit, I didn't even use spell check. All mistakes are my own.\n\n### tl;dr \n\nDuring an \"Item Not As Described (INAD)\" dispute, eBay ALWAYS sides with the buyer until the very last steps of the case no matter what the circumstances, despite all evidence, and in the face of all immediately obvious reason, logic, and common sense. Except it makes perfect sense and you might not even lose your money. Allow me to elaborate.\n\n### The Sale\n\nRewind to October 2025 when I replaced the incumbent Gigabyte MZ33-AR1 Epyc Zen5 motherboard with a Supermicro H14SSL-N for my inference rig. Long story short: don't use Gigabyte motherboards for 4-way Blackwell GPU setups unless sado-masochism is your thing. Anyway, I sold it to a seemingly nice chap on eBay for $900. He seemed a bit clueless about Epyc and compatibility issues, but we exchanged messages and he decided to go ahead with the \"no returns\" purchase of the as-new MZ33-AR1.\n\nOriginal box. All the case candy. As new. Undamaged. Fully working. With hi-res photos (taken on a Nikon D7000 with Nikon 17-55 f2.8 glass and processed in Capture One Pro) of all areas of the motherboard and CPU socket. This is important. \n\n### The Buyer\n\nFast forward a week or so: buyer hits me up with a bunch of Dr Debug codes (although he doesn't know they're Dr Debug codes, he just pulled \"error codes\" from the BMC) claiming the motherboard won't boot. I did him the solid of explaining Dr Debug and I provided a link to an explanation of the codes (https://forum.level1techs.com/t/list-of-dr-debug-bios-codes/114364). He was having issues with CPU initialization. I told him that sometimes re-seating CPU and RAM can help with these sorts of issues.\n\nRe-seating. This is also important.\n\nNext day he hits me up again: will I accept a return? No, because having installation difficulties is not a valid reason for return. Then nothing. Silence.\n\n### The Refund Claim\n\nCue the *very last day of the return window*: I get hit with an \"item not as described\" refund claim. Get this, the buyer:\n\n- uploaded photos of the motherboard with a bent and twisted CPU pin.\n- uploaded a photo of a blank white silkscreen rectangle on the motherboard with a giant red arrow pointing to it and a comment saying \"the motherboard is fake because of this white area\".\n- showed a photo of the computer monitor displaying the BMC interface in which the serial number of the BMC software was 1234567890ABCDEF. He claimed therefore the motherboard was a fake.\n\nWTF. I simultaneously exploded with rage at being accused of selling broken gear as working gear, while exploding with incredulity at the stupidity of trying to assert both damage AND blatantly ridiculous fakery in the same refund claim! My dude should have really picked just one fraudulent claim to keep it somewhat realistic, not two. I calmed down and figured the buyer probably bent the pins in a ham-fisted attempt to re-seat everything. No problem, I thought. I'll explain to eBay what's happening and they'll see reason before shutting this clown down. So I started going through the claim dispute process...\n\n### The Process\n\n...oh, the process. It's designed to (a) refund the buyer at the seller's cost in all cases, (b) be so egregiously demoralizing, time-consuming, and administratively difficult for sellers that they are incentivized to simply give up and accept the fleecing, and (c) automate as much of this process with as few humans in the loop as possible while simultaenously providing as few opportunities as possible for sellers to initiate any communication with eBay.\n\nIt went like this over a period of TWO MONTHS:\n\n- Report the buyer for \"abusing the returns process\".\n- With the new \"case\", it's possible to upload a set of photos and a block of text to refute the buyer's claim(s). \n- I uploaded ALL the hi-res photos I took for the listing's photoshoot in which it was abuntandly clear the motherboard was in perfect condition.\n- I also went to Gigabyte and found the page on the BMC's usermanual containing a screenshot showing the same serial number claimed by the buyer.\n- I went to Gigabyte's MZ33-AR1 web page and found a photo of the motherboard showing exactly the same white rectangle the buyer had called out as fakery.\n- Boom! Done! Solid documentary refutation of all the buyer's claims. Case closed. So I thought.\n- eBay found in favor of the buyer and instructed me to issue a return label.\n- I refused, outraged. No, I said. Look at the photos! He's lying!\n- eBay sent the buyer a label at my expense. He returned the motherboard with its busted CPU pin.\n- I again reported the buyer, showed photos of before and after damage, clearly showing he did the damage, not me.\n- eBay found in favor of the buyer AGAIN and deducted the full cost of the refund from my account.\n- Apoplectic, I hit the \"appeal\" button. I was taken to a webpage that said \"we'll call you in 3 minutes\". WTF?\n- 5 minutes later i got a call from eBay. \n- After briefly explaining the situation to a very engaged US-sounding representative, she told me I needed to do a couple of things:\n\t- Take the text of an email they just sent me (a Disclosure where I swear everything I told eBay is true) and paste it into a Word doc\n\t- Insert a photo/picture of my ink-written signature (luckily I have a scan of exactly that for business reasons).\n\t- Convert to PDF and upload to the secret link in the email they sent.\n\t- No joke, the lady actually stayed on the phone while I did all this! She received the PDF just seconds after I uploaded it.\n\t- This is, I am sure, mostly just another way of making it difficult to actually reverse the appeal.\n- But the rep was good to her word: eBay immediately reversed the decision and the money is back in my account as if the sale had happened like normal. I guess both me and the buyer got our money.\n\n### If It Happens To You\n\nMy advice if this happens to you: \n\n- Accept that no human cares about your case until the very, very last minutes of MONTHS of effort.\n- Accept that no matter what you do eBay will always automatically find in favor of the buyer.\n- Document everything contemporaneously and upload everything you possibly can when given opportunity to do so; you won't get any opportunities to do so again.\n- The data you upload is designed only for the human at the end of the appeals process, not someone looking at it during the claim process. Make it good. You'll need it later.\n- You're going to get enraged because during the claims process \"nothing makes sense\". It all makes sense: it's simply the cheapest way for eBay to handle this process at scale. Keep going.\n- Eventually eBay will find in favor of the buyer and close the case, automatically refunding the buyer \"on your behalf\". You will lose your money.\n- At this point you get the chance to appeal. BE READY. *This is the shot you've been waiting for all this time!* Have your phone, your laptop, your scanned signature, and a way to make PDFs ready BEFORE you initiate the \"call me\" feature.\n- Calmly explain what happened and request that common sense prevail. Ask that they refund your money. Common sense may actually prevail, assuming you made a good contemporaneous case with solid photographs, etc... and assuming you presented it well (not Mr Angry) on the phone... oh, and provided you can make and upload a PDF of your signature on-the-fly during the call!\n\nGood luck!\n\nEdit: please stop sending DMs asking for the eBay handle of the buyer. I'm not in the business of doxxing anyone. Thank you.",

But its horrific stories like this (usually without the happy ending) that keep me far away from ebay when it comes to selling things. I know this restricts my buyer exposure but I only do local facebook marketplace so the buyer can check and verify item function before parting with their cash. \n\nI sold my old 4090 to fund some 3090s for the LLM server and the buyer actually took a two and a half hour train to come down and buy the GPU in person because I refused to post it, though I did set the price a little lower than what was going market rate, I just wanted rid of it so I could start populating the LLM server with the proceeds.\n\nBut lately I've been contemplating offloading my Zen2 Threadripper Pro machine, I haven’t been lurking in r/LocalLLaMA recently as much as I used to. But too scared to deal with the scammy public so instead of selling I might just double down on my investment and misery and upgrade it to Zen3 Threadripper Pro. If I could just find a 5965WX at a reasonable price I could almost double my system memory bandwidth.",

You just have to prepare everything along the way for the moment of final human appeal and hope you laid your breadcrumbs well enough along the way to support a successful appeal.",

And it turned into a drawn out ordeal.\n\nI've sold about 350 tech items on UK ebay, phones smartwatches laptops, mini PCs in the past 6 months. Generally new, but maybe 20-30% second hand. Maybe 1-2% have had issues, courrier issues mostly or sometimes a product was faulty. I often write about who its not for and who shouldn't buy a product - so that deters the unsuitable buyers. \n\nI offer and allow returns because it lifts the conversion rate and if someone changes their mind or they're not happy - they won't sabotage the product. I've kept away from the more expensive end of the market so the risk is spread across various products too. Ironically sometimes the returned products have sold for more than the original price. \n\nThe thing with Motherboards is they can be very fragile or very specific. Like some people might not know certain slots, or compatibility before buying. You may need to offer more hand holding. And this buyer was clumsy. \n\nIf anyone UK based here wants to sell any computer / LLM gear, drives, HDDs, SSDs, old phones - I can give you a price and arrange shipping / as well as safe payment with Paypal. Or we can run it through Ebay if you prefer. I'm good at selling bits of tech and have a cash pile to buy decent stock. I can save you from an ordeal like this.

And if a small deviation occurs during the \"think mode\" (or something important to the plot is simply missed), you could only drop everything and regenerate the entire text from the start.\n\nAnd newest version, Ministral-3-14B-Reasoning-2512, is certainly even smarter, thinking better and can generate long, voluminous texts.

      "text": "So I am training a 1B model right now on my 7900 XTX with some custom kernels I wrote, and while it is training I wanted to optimize the kernels at the same time. However, my VRAM is nearly maxed doing training, so its not ideal.\n\nThen I realized maybe my 2 CU Raphael iGPU might be able to help since I only need to run some limited samples and the speed isn't as important for optimization as it is for training. After doing some research, it turned out that not only does ROCm recognize the iGPU, but a Linux feature called Graphics Translation Table (GTT) for AMD iGPUs can use up to 128 GB of system memory as VRAM. It even allocates it dynamically, so it isn't removed from your CPU's memory pool until it is allocated. I think a lot of people running Strix Halo are probably using the bios setting, but if you are running Linux you should check to see if GTT works for you since its dynamically allocated.\n\nThis isn't very useful for most people:\n\n1) It isn't going to be good for inference because iGPUs are very very slow, and usually the CPU itself is faster for inference.\n\n2) I'm accessing ROCm directly via C++ / HIP kernels, so I can avoid all the support issues ROCm has for iGPUs in the python stack\n\nHowever, for development it is actually pretty awesome. I allocated 24 GB of GTT so now the iGPU can load a full training run that my main GPU can run so I can profile it. Meanwhile my main GPU is doing long term loss convergence tests in parallel. Since RDNA iGPUs have been around for a while now, this enables big memory AMD GPU kernel development for cheap.\n\nAlso it might be interesting for developing hybrid CPU/GPU architectures. The MI300A does exist which has unified HBM tied to a CPU and giant iGPU. A standard ryzen laptop could kind of sort of simulate it for cheap. Stuff like vector indexing on the CPU into big GEMMs on the GPU could be done without PCIE overhead.\n\nI thought it was cool enough to post. Probably a \"Cool story bro\" moment for most of you though haha.",

The default is -1 (It’s VRAM size if 3GB < VRAM < 3/4 RAM, otherwise 3/4 RAM size).\n\nSo as long as you have more than 4GB of RAM, the driver automatically allows up to 3/4 of the RAM to be allocated to the iGPU.\n\nI've run stuff on a Vega 8 iGPU on a laptop using llama.cpp and it does work. However, it's not a great experience if you want to watch videos (or do basically anything else GUI-wise) at the same time, since llama.cpp hogs all the memory bandwidth and causes everything else to stutter. GPU scheduling is pretty much non-existent on Linux AFAIK, so there's not really a great way to mitigate this atm.\n\nAlso a hint for fellow ThinkPad users: even though the spec sheet says only a certain amount of RAM is supported, you should probably be able to add more without issues. My current E595's specs say only up to 32GB is supported, but I added a 32GB stick alongside the existing 8GB for a total of 40GB and it works.",

      "text": "I saw the recent [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1px1c41/head_of_engineering_minimax_ai_on_minimax_m2_int4/) here regarding MiniMax engineer's tweet about why they decided *against* using int4 QAT for the MiniMax M2.1 model.\n\nInterestingly, at the time of the K2 Thinking release, a Kimi infra engineer posted a deep dive on Zhihu explaining why native int4 QAT was actually crucial for them. I’ve summarized the key takeaways below to offer a different perspective on the 'to quant or not to quant' debate.\n\n**TL;DR:** Kimi found int4 QAT is essential for **MoE latency**, **long-context stability**, and **speeding up the RL training loop**.\n\n# Decoding is Memory-Bound (Latency Focus)\n\nUnlike the MiniMax case, Kimi found that for their specific MoE architecture (which is highly sparse), the decoding phase is almost exclusively memory-bound. By using W4A16 (4-bit weights, 16-bit activations), they reduced memory usage significantly. This allowed the model to fit on fewer GPUs, which reduced inter-device communication overhead, a major factor in lowering end-to-end latency for users.\n\n# PTQ Failed at \"Thinking\" Lengths\n\nThe team initially tried standard Post-Training Quantization (PTQ). While it worked for short responses, it fell apart for the long chain-of-thought \"thinking\" process. As generation length increased, quantization errors accumulated, leading to degradation. Furthermore, PTQ struggled with sparse experts; if an expert wasn't hit frequently during the calibration step with the calibration dataset, it essentially \"forgot\" knowledge. QAT (Quantization Aware Training) was necessary to make the model \"lossless\" compared to the BF16 baseline.\n\n# A less discussed benefit: Faster RL Training\n\nThis is the point that often gets overlooked: Int4 QAT wasn't just for inference serving, it accelerated the training process itself. In Reinforcement Learning, the model spends a massive amount of time in the \"rollout\" phase (generating text). By using the Int4 model for these rollouts, they reduced the total time for an RL iteration by 10-20%. It also reduced the discrepancy between the training forward pass and the inference engine.\n\n# Why Int4 and not FP4?\n\nThey chose standard Int4 over newer formats like FP4 to maintain compatibility with existing hardware (non-Blackwell GPUs) and to utilize mature, highly efficient kernels like Marlin.\n\nIn summary, I believe there isn't a one-size-fits-all answer regarding quantization. It depends heavily on the model's parameters and specific architecture. It is a matter of trade-offs.\n\n[ AI translation, there may be some translation errors.](https://preview.redd.it/dzmceu5zybag1.png?width=1362&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0ba8f78c6e5ade3463a1c62fba1d338a1c01ce9)\n\n",
