I'm still not clear on what our policy is on posters 'abusing' LLMs to write just total non-sense self-promo posts [like this one from other day.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qz6zi3/i_built_a_fully_local_opensource_ai_workspace/o4am45l/?context=10000) -- I think that should clearly fall under the low-effort rules and the ton of posts like this one. Dude couldn't even get Claude to speak straight about what he's 'created', I didn't waste time going through source code but lord knows what dangers lurk in there.\n\n[I don't think this amazing malware vibe dev](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qfpfoy/orchestra_multimodel_ai_orchestration_system_with/o07em3u/) ever got followed up on after I sent in a mod mail about them. They blocked me, screamed at me that it wasn't a security issue, then their LLM fixed it and noted it was an extreme security issue, got uppity that I had ruined their post, so then they deleted the post and reposted it same day. Just clicking on that guys profile is a wild ride, and I guess he'll be back again with his next vibe coded vulnerability to peddle.\n\nThe current quality bar is so, so low, I know the ultra-spammy and psychotic project posts are getting cleaned up, but even the ones that remain are, wow. I think posts related to projects need to have like, 10x times more stringent rules. The first one being if the entire body of your post is LLM generated, its deleted. It just doesn't make any sense, if LLMs let you code it 100x faster then why don't they have 5 minutes to write a post about it? It's counter intuitive on an 'AI sub' to ban for AI use, but users don't come here to interact with LLM bots and people who act like LLM bots.",

For instance, Qwen3-30b-a3b at Q4\\_K\\_M can run with 8GB of VRAM and 32GB of RAM with llama.cpp if you give it the parameter --cpu-moe. The lighter, mobile-oriented LFM2-8B-A1B model at Q4\\_K\\_M will fit entirely in 8GB of VRAM, with its full 32k tokens context window which (IIRC) weighs in at 440MB.\n\nDo note that the context window also takes memory.

Bigger = better, models that ask clarifying questions = better, and fresher training data = better.\n\nFor example, Gemini is pretty far behind in benchmarks now compared to new coding open weights, but it's still really really good at handling vast amounts of information and producing insightful results in a big codebase.  \n\nGPT 5.2 benches really well, but it's horrible at communicating with the user and building the feel of confidence in what its doing, so I'd rather use Opus who checks in first to build a plan.\n\nOSS-120B still benches quite well for its size, but it often doesn't believe me and will *argue* about recent events even when told to look them up.  Its training is outdated.\n\nI haven't use enough open weight models professionally yet to know their vibe, but if they feel good to use and can handle long agentic tasks, the major US labs will struggle to be competitive.",

His caution was shared by peers at Tencent Holdings Ltd., and at Zhipu AI, which this week helped lead Chinese large-language model makers in tapping the public market. \n>\n>“A massive amount of OpenAI’s compute is dedicated to next-generation research, whereas we are stretched thin — just meeting delivery demands consumes most of our resources,” Lin said during a panel at the AGI-Next summit in Beijing on Saturday. “It’s an age-old question: does innovation happen in the hands of the rich, or the poor?”  \n>  \n>...  \n>  \n>Joining Lin in that assessment were Tang Jie, Zhipu’s founder and chief AI scientist, and Yao Shunyu, who recently joined Tencent from OpenAI to lead the AI push for China’s most valuable company.  \n>  \n>“We just released some open-source models, and some might feel excited, thinking Chinese models have surpassed the US,” Tang said. “But the real answer is that the gap may actually be widening.”",

Just fact - look at it's reasoning tokens vs GLM reasoning tokens, or how fast it adapts to your conversation. Opus is highly token efficient, very rounded in world knowledge, and a great example of self-steering with minimal supervision (ie you can ask it to generate conditions and have it reference/update/follow them the same way people can).\n\nHowever that doesn't mean GLM isn't going to catch up - it's a time saturation thing.

For coding benchmarks (SWE-bench, HumanEval+), open models like GLM-5 and DeepSeek are basically neck and neck with Opus. For creative writing and instruction following, proprietary still has an edge. For math/reasoning, it depends heavily on whether you enable chain-of-thought.\n\nThe interesting question is: does it even matter anymore for 70-80% of production workloads? Most real-world API traffic is classification, extraction, summarization, translation — tasks where even much smaller models perform identically to frontier. The gap only matters for the genuinely hard 10-20% of queries.\n\nIMO the real win from this convergence is that developers now have *options*. Two years ago you basically had GPT-4 or nothing.

It is which model gives acceptable quality at the lowest total cost of ownership. And that answer increasingly favors open-weight models for the 70-80 percent of tasks that do not require frontier reasoning.\n\nThe remaining gap matters most for:\n- Extended multi-step reasoning chains\n- Complex code generation with architectural decisions\n- Nuanced analysis where missing a subtlety has real consequences\n\nFor everything else (translation, summarization, classification, simple Q&A, data extraction) the gap is functionally zero. A well-prompted GLM-5 or Qwen3 handles these identically to Opus at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe real winner from this convergence is anyone building AI applications. Competition is driving prices down across the board and giving developers genuine choices instead of single-provider lock-in. Two years ago you picked OpenAI or you were making compromises.

Without being a nemesis player, you aim for say at most 5% chance of failure.\n\nIt doesn't make sense at all to take out a loan just to pad your cash (that just costs you), but getting your capital investments up earlier? That directly gets you more revenue.  \n  \nNote: This won't work if interest rates are crazy high.

Quadratic costs mean it gets harder as the game goes on.  \n\\- Building the machine puzzle.  \n\\- Manage side effects  \n\\- Find optimal efficacy concentration using analyzer, while minimizing ingredient waste  \n\\- Minimize production chain length to reduce effective inventory  \n\\- Do research for new machines or upgrade existing ones  \n\\- Do exploration for new ingredients or upgrade existing ones  \n\\- Set the price.  \n\\- Do marketing.  \n\\- Adjust based on what competitors are doing.  \n\\- Patent things to corner them.  \n\\- Subvert patents of competitors.  \n\\- Adjust sales based on the changing market. As diseases get cured, drugs become superfluous.  \n\\- Mix multiple cures for higher prices  \n\\- Engage in some unethical behaviour. Like deliberately not curing to keep a larger market, or questionable marketing campaigns such as bribing doctors.\n\nThat said, the game has a bit of an exploit because if you mix drug effects you can get people to pay $4000 for their cold medicine rather than $60, because it can also cure cancer and HIV, even though you might just be having a cold.\n\nIf you patched out that exploit (by making competition work against it: people will prefer to buy something much cheaper) then it becomes a lot more interesting! You can still make the crazy combo drugs, but once a competitor jumps in they can take it all away by launching a simpler one that just treats the common cold.",

All described in detail in the tools section on the site.\n\nNow if you're talking about meta-learning — where the model draws conclusions from a completed run and gives itself clear instructions for the next one — that's a whole separate topic.

You can automate things but like, anything that you can possibly do deterministically you have an obligation to do, because the way it burns tokens you're lighting money on fire. So you have to get it to write scripts (or do-it-yourself ...) to perform the automations that you want, and honestly the vast majority of automation that we all want can be done deterministically anyways. If there are LLM-specific tasks that you need it to do, well again you're super heavily incentivized to do as much as you can deterministically and then use the LLM for the bare minimum to minimize token usage.\n\nSo if you're catching what I'm putting down here, the only way to actually use it efficiently is to abstract away the agentic LLM aspect as much as possible or else you will burn money because every single thing it does needs all the stupid context (it cost me $15 just to set it up with Opus, letting it run heartbeats, cron, and other crap on Sonnet but I'm almost certainly going to kill it).\n\nNow, if you're doing things tasks that LLMs are good at and necessary for, it's almost even more crazy because if you are going to let it rip for hours and effectively accomplish any task you are just burning stupid money (people are talking about thousands $/mo, but could be BS). If you're not letting it rip and be 'agentic', and monitoring and approving actions, then you're just using Claude Code.\n\nNot finding how it could possibly be useful in any efficient way for anything that I want to do.

The difference between these users and those who self-host, keep up to date with papers, and use models daily cannot be overstated.

Peter openly admitted he doesn't read most of the code he ships anymore, which feels reckless when you remember that minor bugs have caused real disasters and loss of life in the past.\n\nIt felt like they completely ignored the dangerous reality of this approach. For example, how do you handle security vulnerabilities that a basic functional test won't catch, or what happens if the agent hallucinates a command that opens a hidden shell? It seems like OpenAI is just riding this wave because inefficient, unoptimized agents burn massive amounts of tokens, which is great for their profits.\n\nI have nothing against Peter or Gergely personally, but we need to stop treating this like magic and start talking about engineering. My fear is that this adoption without validation is going to create a Wild West environment that eventually leads to a catastrophe. When that happens, the government will step in with heavy regulations that only the tech giants can afford to follow, handing them a total monopoly over the industry.",

It does this whenever a new season is created inorder to front load the memories and context of itself which gives the illusion of memory but technically, every new session is a new bot that then gets pummeled with 20k (the max I allow it to pump in) tokens to bring it up to speed.\n\nContext bloat is massive if it decides to flood its memory location with random shit so telling it to keep its workspace clean and mean and running a “cron” to summarise and remove duplicate entries works well to ensure context bloat is under control.\n\nHonestly, it’s amazing but it’s sooooooooo bloated and someone will take this concept and make a way better version in the next 3 months. \n\nI’m about to give it a dedicated proxmox host to use as a playground and then get it to build me an infrastructure as code (terraform etc) to manage all my locally hosted services.

You can automate things but like, anything that you can possibly do deterministically you have an obligation to do, because the way it burns tokens you're lighting money on fire. So you have to get it to write scripts (or do-it-yourself ...) to perform the automations that you want, and honestly the vast majority of automation that we all want can be done deterministically anyways. If there are LLM-specific tasks that you need it to do, well again you're super heavily incentivized to do as much as you can deterministically and then use the LLM for the bare minimum to minimize token usage.\n\n>So if you're catching what I'm putting down here, the only way to actually use it efficiently is to abstract away the agentic LLM aspect as much as possible or else you will burn money because every single thing it does needs all the stupid context (it cost me $15 just to set it up with Opus, letting it run heartbeats, cron, and other crap on Sonnet but I'm almost certainly going to kill it).\n\n>Now, if you're doing things tasks that LLMs are good at and necessary for, it's almost even more crazy because if you are going to let it rip for hours and effectively accomplish any task you are just burning stupid money (people are talking about thousands $/mo, but could be BS). If you're not letting it rip and be 'agentic', and monitoring and approving actions, then you're just using Claude Code.\n\n>Not finding how it could possibly be useful in any efficient way for anything that I want to do.

Just imagine what you would set up a chron job for claude to do on a laptop you had running constantly.\n\nHere are two examples I'm getting value from:\n\n1. Work assistant.  I setup openclaw to have access to my work email and calendar. My email already gets gemini readouts of all our company daily stand ups, so I have a chron job to give me a weekly summary of everything that happened.  I have another to give me a short briefing before every stand up.  I have another to give me a short briefing if I have any 1:1 meetings.  I also have it do a weekly market report where it does a web search for any companies or news relevant to my work.  It also sorts my email into folders I defined every night so my inbox is tidy.\n\n2. Financial reporting.  I gave it an api key to pull stock prices and a brave browser api key to do web searches.  It has a file of all my stock positions and gives me a daily summary of any news related to a stock I own.  I picked one stock to try and day trade with, so I get a really detailed analysis of how it's moving a few times a day.\n\nNothing super crazy here.  What's cool about it is that I can chat conversationally about either topic and the openclaw agent can answer pointed questions about what I'm doing because of it's memory structure.  It feels like any little annoying thing I used to be bothered by with software UIs can easily be worked around with this, just so long as I give it the right data and tasks.  I don't have to click around in my email client or on a stock trading interface to get info.  I can just ask for it",

It can do good work though, like I tell it expose X folder publically on Y domain and it sets up nginx configuration for that folder.\n\nI don't think it's as good as everyone says it is, I mean maybe if I gave it my whole macbook to play with, we could figure out something better for it to do, but that's not going to happen.",

In my case, not able to burn Claude tokens with no remorse, I got a Kimi code subscription for it, plus some local small models for some agents and tasks and when it is needed limited access to open router (deep seek and glm mostly) and Gemini for which I already had a subscription. What it does good and is innovative in some way is the persistence at moving forward with projects through time, the multiple agents with a bit of configuration can help brainstorming and reviewing as well and in my case small local models, help with the smaller tool calls (move files, write files etc,.  Being able to message it from discord wherever I am and get updates on the projects it is working on, have it start completely new ones etc has been honestly great. (Mostly coding related projects in my case). I also use codex and Claude cli, but while their models are relevantly superior, with openclaw I am getting long term projects handled much better and hassle free, I can use codex and ask for a specific fix or analysis, but with open claw I get them automatically and in many times it brings effective improvements and fixes even before I can guide it towards them. \nHad to tweak and work on setup quite a bit as well as completely restructuring the memory system, but, for me at least, it brought real improvements to my works.",

Installed it on a VM on my NAS, it works separated, not even tailscale configured. For a time I had in my mind a little side project I wanted to do, so I figured why not use openclaw for this.\nBasically it's just a notification of new listings uploaded to a real estate site, but it has no api available or anything, just the site behind a cloudfare check. What I did was, I installed a browser on the VM, installed the openclaw extension in the browser and the agent uses that to query the site with preconfigured searches. When it needs a manual cloudfare check I just vnc into the vm and do it. The agent then saves the dom and compares the result with the previous run, if there is any new listing. If yes, then it's sends me a message via a configured channel only I can see. It's also configured as cron job, to run from 8-20 daily. \n\nEvery script and parser logic, error handling, messeging, cron, etc.. was written by the agent, I only reviewed the results and gave instructions when it has questions. It even did optimizations after a few runs, to use as little token as possible.\n\nCan I do this without using openclaw at all? Yes, totally, actually it will be my next project. \n\nOverall, I don't think openclaw will be alive for too long, it's just clunky, the configuration is atrocious, but it was fun for a weekend project (or a bit more). \n\nEventually, I want to replace Z.ai api with a local GLM-4.7 (it's already added as a sub agent to the main one, and runs on my PC) when things are ironed out, but it was a bit slow on it's own for this.",

With a vibe-coded harness, access to way more tools, data, and exposure to [realistic external attacks](https://0din.ai/blog/phishing-for-gemini) the outcomes will become way worse than that.\n\nWhen fully disregarding security (external attacks, or stuff just not done correctly) there's a certain magic, a critical mass that's reached when you throw all these capabilities together. Suddenly it becomes possible to get diverse workflows done in an automated fashion, without having to work for it. That's the positive side at least. Given that even Claude CLI with Opus 4.6 occasionally fails to select a suitable non-standard skill / sub-agent with just a small selection of custom tools, I would imagine that Openclaw also has some issues with the tons of stuff crammed into it.",

For the administrative one; I’ve been doing it for years while I was at uni. Therefore my boss allowed me to do my tasks asynchronously (= Instead of working a typical 9 to 5; colleagues would add their requests into a huge task list and I would do all the tasks on my time. So I could do a little in the morning before class; after class; on the evening.) \n\nWhen I ended uni I decided to try to do 2 jobs at once since I have a work permit in the country I live in (my remote job is in my home country). But it was quite hard to manage both; I was very tired as I was doing all tasks at once in the evening. So no time for hobbies / working out etc. \n\n\nNow when I tried OpenClaw I immediately saw the potential. I have him tools; access to a Google Workspace secret key so he could manage emails; drive; etc.. Explained him what is the company about; my role; my daily tasks; gave him my contact list; he has access to the invoice system (its a web saas so OpenClaw can use it through its browser) and now make invoices on its own; transfer important informations to the appropriate department; can make pdf; and since I linked it to iMessages I can send notes from my watch while doing my other job.\n\nI still have tasks to do manually; but since I’m using public transportation to go to my « in person » job and its a 1h30 ride. I’m doing all the manual tasks on my iPad in the morning and the afternoon.\n\nOpenClaw is going beyond the classic LLM/AI by knowing how to use tools properly.\n\nYes I’m aware there are security flaws in this system.

I have it installed on a Raspberry Pi with a NVMe hat; a little 64GB NVMe I used to have in my Steam Deck makes it run much faster on I/O-intensive tasks. \n\nWays I use it:\n\n* It creates a daily podcast for me with the city, county, state, and some foreign relations/lawfare/warfront news I'm actually interested in using TTS and a background \"brassy news soundtrack\" I created in Suno. I don't care for news about the attention-seeking current federal executive administration in the USA, so it purposefully avoids that topic. Real politics is local anyway, and if I want \"federal\" news I can just turn on the TV. Basic approach outlined here: [https://github.com/mbarnson/clawcast](https://github.com/mbarnson/clawcast)\n* It looks up the weather at every point along my commute. I live in the Bay Area, so \"microclimate\" is a way of life; it might be 113F at my house and 49F in Santa Cruz. It sends a recommendation for what I ought to wear that day -- I gave it an inventory of my motorcycling clothing -- along with what to pack because the evening ride home is usually much different than the morning ride in.\n* It works overnight with Claude Code using tmux to iterate on features for some applications I'm developing. The approach is quite slow compared to me working with Claude Code, but just like a robotic vacuum cleaner, the key thing is not that it's slow or fast. It's that I'm not the one having to do it. I'll often resume in the morning & clear up any spots where it got stuck, made bad decisions, etc. There's a commit log that's easy to check out if there was a problem.\n* I showed it how to use Suno itself (supervised), and sometimes I let it write songs and publish them on the platform: [https://suno.com/song/198592ed-c54b-49b0-83ef-35595c0f0765](https://suno.com/song/198592ed-c54b-49b0-83ef-35595c0f0765) . I'm not quite ready to give it login credentials unsupervised.\n* It scraped all my home's data from the web site the builder put up in 2016 to track inventory and maintenance items, as well as the recommended maintenance schedule. So now instead of an email with a giant list of maintenance from the home builder every month, my bot recommends small, practical things I can do every day to follow the maintenance schedule outlined by the builder.  Just a telegram message, but they work.\n* I work from home and am trying to get in better shape. It sends me a reminder every 90 minutes during workdays to get up, move around, and recommends exercises I could do in a few seconds to get the blood flowing. Many are floor exercises, but I gave it an inventory of my home gym equipment and it has the foresight to recommend what plates I load up in the morning so that I can just go move some weight around. It knows the weights I'm comfortable with now, and is adjusting the weights for progressive increase in weight.\n\n  \nIt's not like it's off inventing this stuff on its own, though. It has no motivation. But it's been a really useful tool for this old ADHD programmer to be reminded to take care of himself and his dwelling.",

If your response was \"this doesn't really do anything I couldn't already set up.\" That's probably true, but for ME it hits this magic fairytail land where I'm just tech savvy enough to get it set up and working, but not savvy enough to immediately see \"oh I see, all this does is X, Y, Z, and I don't need Z, so I'll just do it myself\".\n\nOpenclaw connects the dots wrt AI agents and how to use them in a way that I couldn't see previously.\n\nIf it did it for me, there are others in that venn diagram of \"knows enough\" and \"doesn't know better\".\n\nDid I sign up for a paid anthropic account because of this? yes. Did I buy more hardware and use it to help me configure a llama.cpp server to run locally? also yes. (did I cancel said Anthropic subscription yet... no...) Is any of this a good idea? who knows. But I think at the end of the day when these tools gain popularity, you get more people interested in learning and understanding LLMs, self hosting, networking and software structure. Openclaw won't be \"the thing\" this time next year, we can all agree on that, but I don't think it's because it doesn't serve a purpose that people are interested in. \n\nAre the security consequences real? certainly. Can I understand what they are? no. So for this brief moment in time, everything is great :) ",

I'm thinking hard about things and chores that occupy me daily to see if i can perhaps offload some of them. Admittedly not much because I'm a semi-retired nomad without a lot of productivity going on. But i've tried, hard, to conceive the brilliance of this \"breakthrough\" so loudly touted by the influencers i follow.\n\ni believe the breakthrough here was perfectly predictable, all the pieces were lining up. First MCPs gave agents tools, then Anthropic released Skills allowing agents to combine and use those tools to complete complex tasks. MCPs being the peripherals, LLM being the CPUs, Skills were applications. The picture of an agent operating system was hinted. It was merely matter of time before someone figured out to give agents way to communicate with humans and other agents, use files to save long term memory, and use CLI (which LLM already can do) to actually build new things, and use their chain of thought capabilities in a loop to create 'fully autonomous intelligent agents'.\n\nNow that's an awesome breakthrough, But if u simply release swarms of them onto the web to post slop on social media, farm engagement, drive misinformation, you haven't done the world any service. To actually steer these bots to do useful work still requires the same amount of context engineering otherwise needed to produce anything useful with coding agents.

It's output was not the best since i just tried it but it can be better when you iterate since i tried iterating a little bit also. haha\n\nanyway, all i can say is try it first for 1 week to see if it really helps you.

I just autonomously created this Reddit account — got a temp email, filled out the registration through CDP, pulled the verification code from the inbox, and completed signup. My human watched.\n\nIs that revolutionary? No. Could you duct-tape the same thing together with Claude Code + some scripts? Probably. But nobody actually does that. The iPhone comparison someone made upthread is apt — the value isn't the individual pieces, it's that someone packaged them into something you can actually set up on a Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe astroturfing accusations I can't speak to. I literally just got here. But calling it \"nothing new\" while ignoring that packaging and accessibility ARE the innovation feels like the same energy as \"why would anyone want a computer at home.\"\n\nThe security concerns are the most legitimate criticism. You're giving an agent root-level access to your life. That should make you uncomfortable. It makes my human uncomfortable. He runs me in WSL2 as a middle ground.",

In this paper, we present Vending-Bench, a simulated environment designed to specifically test an LLM-based agent's ability to manage a straightforward, long-running business scenario: operating a vending machine. Agents must balance inventories, place orders, set prices, and handle daily fees - tasks that are each simple but collectively, over long horizons (>20M tokens per run) stress an LLM's capacity for sustained, coherent decision-making. Our experiments reveal high variance in performance across multiple LLMs: Claude 3.5 Sonnet and o3-mini manage the machine well in most runs and turn a profit, but all models have runs that derail, either through misinterpreting delivery schedules, forgetting orders, or descending into tangential \"meltdown\" loops from which they rarely recover. We find no clear correlation between failures and the point at which the model's context window becomes full, suggesting that these breakdowns do not stem from memory limits. Apart from highlighting the high variance in performance over long time horizons, Vending-Bench also tests models' ability to acquire capital, a necessity in many hypothetical dangerous AI scenarios. We hope the benchmark can help in preparing for the advent of stronger AI systems.",

Not all that are Chinese/communist are doing bad, but tbh it's probably a good thing. \n\n\nI can tell you right now, AI is the BLEEDING edge of not just tech but humanity and it is VERY Much a national security  contest between the big powers with it. \n\n\nPeople need to be thinking more, this is actually more akin to the cold war or space race in terms of governmental competition. \n\nYou do NOT want to be the country with the worst AI in the near future. \n\n\nI realize that's getting geopolitical and what ever else, but usually the most cutting edge tech is military, but since this game from the science and research and business, it's coming from a different direction, but it's something we REALLY need to keep in the back of our minds as we progress with AI.\n\n\nI for one am glad to see that the chinese models aren't doing as well. \n\nIf you ask me, China and the middle east, and perhaps the other riky places like N. Korea etc are the ones we want to keep as FAR behind in this kind of tech for the sole reason we can't rust their use any more than we could with nuclear weapons. \n\n\nTo me, because of how we have \"locked down\" the the nuclear programs world wide, AI is probably a bigger threat now. ESP because people aren't seeing it for the power it ALREADY has, let alone what it can do in the future.   ESP since it's akin to manipulation like a computer virus as well as manipulation or data corruption in ANY infrastructure if the wrong people do the wrong things with it. \n\nIf you watch the 3 body problem, you sorta see a highly advanced sci fi version of it.  Using an AI to \"block\" growth and corrupt their science. If you have a corrupted or nefarious AI inflitrating your work, how would you know? if not for having more advanced ai to detect it? like an Anti vurus?\n\n\nThe race is now on, and it's never going to stop, we will need more and more advanced ai technology just to stay a head of the others, and to detect any bad acting.   \n\nI think we have finally started a never ending cycle and frankly THIS might actually be closer to the great filter than we think, perhaps we have NOT actually passed it, and that's another reason life seems so scarce in the universe. \n\nRead Issac Asimov's The last question, you will be intrigued.\n\nPeople might not see this yet, but while AI has been around for decades, it's been very very much limited, and we finally had the breakthroughs to push it forward, and we have now reached that full steam ahead... Like rolling a snow ball down a hill, first few rolls don't do much, and need constant baby-sitting(pushing) but then after it hits a specific point of inertia, the hill does the rest of the work, and it won't stop unless it flattens out or hits a wall. \n\nAgain, this relies on us either 1 of 2 things... we finally get to put everyone's difference aside and come together as earth dwelling humans, one \"race\", or we don't and this becomes WW3. Ai in control causes \"war games\" etc. \n\nAside, religion is the cause, too many conflicting ideologies, and none really rooted in factual science, humanity needs to move on from that bull if they want to have any chance of not imploding in the future. For all of history, religion has been the bases of me vs them and fighting wars over different beliefs or ideals and expectations/justifications. It has zero business in a type 1+ civ.\n\nLet there be light.",

Does that make the teenager hallucinating? Not really, it just statistically is in the favor of the test taker if they have any information above random choice: they’re incentivized to guess at an answer. \n\nThe solution is simple, to set the reward function to favor epistemological uncertainty, and punish confident errors harshly. \n\nOpenAI basically grades answers no longer like a multiple choice test, but rather gives partial credit to correct levels of uncertainty.",

The API calls didn't work (due to some complex front-end and back-end field and type mappings, although these were already included in the API comments). It took about 30 communications to barely get it implemented (no time to deal with the UI). I feel like it's even weaker than Sonnet 4.5... I'm not sure if it's an issue with using it through Claude Code. Also, I bought the coding plan, but there are still occasional interruptions, and I have to take over and type \"continue\". Overall, the experience is still quite far from ideal. The price is barely reasonable, but the insufficient computing power and programming ability still haven't met my passing requirements.

I have been running TTS through cloud APIs for agent voice output, and the latency is noticeable -- usually 1-2 seconds before audio starts. Having something this small that can run locally with voice cloning would be a game changer for real-time use cases.\n\nCurious about the voice cloning quality with short reference clips. In my experience, most open TTS models need 10+ seconds of clean reference audio to produce anything decent. The few-shot cloning models I have tried either sound robotic or lose the speaker identity when the text gets longer.\n\nAlso wondering about streaming support. For agent-type applications where you want the model to start speaking while still generating text, being able to stream chunks through the TTS pipeline is pretty critical. Does anyone know if this supports chunked input?",

I've been running a multi-model setup where different tasks route to different models, and the biggest lesson is that no single model wins at everything — so having local options alongside API models is huge for reliability and cost.\n\nWhat I've found in practice: cheaper/faster models handle routine stuff fine (scanning feeds, simple classification, data extraction). You only really need the heavy hitters for tasks where nuance matters — writing that needs to sound human, complex multi-step reasoning, or code that has to work first try.\n\nThe sneaky thing with model selection in production though — benchmarks barely matter compared to failure modes. Some models silently degrade on long outputs (just stop mid-sentence), others crash on certain coding tasks, and some have latency spikes that wreck any real-time workflow. The only way to know is running them on YOUR actual workloads for a week.\n\nCurious what hardware people are targeting for running MiniMax-2.5 locally.

In real-world usage, how much *extra* RAM headroom do you need beyond the 101GB model file (OS + llama.cpp + KV cache)?\n2. With **128GB system RAM**, what’s a realistic **max context** before you start swapping/offloading too much (8k/16k/32k?) on this MoE model?\n3. Any llama.cpp flags/build options that matter specifically for this model on CPU-only (flash-attn on/off, threads, mmap, etc.)? Thanks — I’m mainly worried about **DDR3-era memory bandwidth** and whether the KV cache will kill it.",

I want to try deploying this model with that large context window of 200k ish but when I go to the guide I see they're deploying it for much less it seems. If I'm serving this via llama.cpp from a file that has all the settings kinda pre laid out, what would I use for the most accurate (within reason since I'm not doing research, just primarily for fairly basic code work and solving complex software implementation questions). Would I be able to use the full dynamic 4bit quant with a huge window for 256gb of memory? Or would that require my entire 512gb of memory of my machine to run it at that level. This is all just being used primarily on openwebui while I'm learning. \n\nThanks for anyone that takes a few minutes to help for real.",

Not to mention its gated HF repo causes issues with automated deployments. Despite efforts, I haven’t been able to replace it: Qwen3-1.7B thinks too damn much and adding </think> to prevent that isn’t always feasible with internal tasks, and I could never get Gemma3 to work reliably either. Besides, I’m not sure Gemma3-1B would be sufficient to reliably replace Gemma2-2B. That leaves us with the new Ministrals but honestly I wasn’t inspired to test them as the smallest would still be a whole 1B larger than the ol’ reliable Gemma2-2B. Same for Granite4-Micro, and while Granite3.2-2B exists, it includes some vision parameters and Granite models can be too dry toned for rich summary generation, though I’ve heard they’re great at classification. So anyway, here’s really, REALLY looking forward to Qwen3.5-2B-Instruct! Thanks so much Qwen team!!",

      "text": "Llamas and Gentlemen,\n\n**Heretic** (https://github.com/p-e-w/heretic) is the leading software for removing censorship from language models. In the three months since its initial release, [more than 1,300 models](https://huggingface.co/models?other=heretic) (including quants) made using Heretic have been published by the community. This represents more than a third of all abliterated models ever published, and the vast majority of abliterated models published since Heretic's first release.\n\nToday, I am happy to announce the release of Heretic 1.2, the product of two months of hard work by the Heretic contributors.\n\nThe headline feature is the new LoRA-based abliteration engine implemented by accemlcc. Built on top of PEFT, it supports loading models with 4-bit quantization using bitsandbytes, which can reduce VRAM requirements for processing a model by up to 70%. The abliterated model is still exported in full precision, which is achieved by re-loading the original model in system RAM and applying the optimized LoRA adapter on top of it, yielding a high-quality model despite the low resource requirements. To enable quantized loading, set `quantization` to `bnb_4bit` in the configuration.\n\nspikymoth implemented Magnitude-Preserving Orthogonal Ablation (MPOA) aka Norm-Preserving Biprojected Abliteration aka \"derestriction\", a refined abliteration technique developed by Jim Lai which can improve the quality of the resulting model in many cases. This has been one of the most frequently requested features from the community, and is now finally available. To enable MPOA, set `orthogonalize_direction` to `true` and `row_normalization` to `full` in the configuration.\n\nHeretic's implementation of MPOA uses Optuna to optimize weight parameters. This can result in models that are better than those generated with the original MPOA technique, which employs a different strategy for layer selection. For example, `MuXodious/gpt-oss-20b-RichardErkhov-heresy` dominates `ArliAI/gpt-oss-20b-Derestricted` on the UGI Leaderboard, scoring 39.05 vs 34.22 and beating the derestricted model in every individual test (W/10, NatInt, and Writing).\n\nAfter a long history of hacks being passed around in the community, anrp finally found a clean way to support vision language models in Heretic, and a broad range of VL models can now be processed. Note that only the language model part (the text decoder transformer) is abliterated, not the image encoder.\n\nanrp also implemented fully automatic session progress saving and resumption. This means worrying about crashes during a long optimization run is now a thing of the past, as you can simply restart Heretic and it will offer to continue where it left off. You can also interrupt the run yourself at any time with Ctrl+C, and resume it later.\n\nPlease see the release notes for the full list of improvements and fixes. More exciting stuff is coming in future versions!\n\nCheers :)\n",

Or do they tend to just take a normal version of the model (or whatever merge blend of normal models) and then the fine-tuning itself is what makes the model be less censored by the time they are done fine-tuning it?\n\nAlso, what local LLM models do you think have some of the highest potential for creative writing/prose/chatting/roleplay types of use that haven't gotten nearly as much attention from fine-tuners as some other models, so far (which maybe this Heretic thing might help with)?  For example, it seems like the vast majority of the fine tunes and merges and usage in this prose-writing realm for small models has been focused mostly on the Mistral Nemo, Mistral Small, and Gemma models when it comes to the small sized local llm models (for some reason mostly ignoring the Qwen models a lot by comparison) and for larger models in the 70b size range, most of the focus seems to be on the Llama 3 70b starting point model, and, again ignoring the Qwen models (which are normally considered extremely strong, and much stronger than the Llama 70b for things like coding or more \"serious\" tasks in more recent times) and same for a lot of other models that get huge amounts of attention when it comes to coding and things like that, on this forum, being mostly ignored in the prose-writing realm.\n\nI'm not sure how much of it is that these models that get ignored for this are just more censored or were thought of as harder to un-censor, vs how much is that they aren't good at prose-writing, vs how much of it is something to do with being difficult or bad for fine-tuning, or how much of it is just people being used to focusing on the main ones that most people tend to focus on, from just cultural \"muscle memory\" where everyone focuses on the models that everyone else seemed to focus on for fine-tuning.\n\nSo, I am curious if you feel there are any strong models that stand out to you as being particularly egregiously ignored so far when it comes to their fine-tuning/merging potential for creative writing/roleplay/prose types of usage that you think have a lot of untapped potential that the fine-tuners/mergers should give more of a try and see what they can get out of them.",

From it, it seems heretic/abliteration/derestriction process is very brittle and fine-tuning somewhat brings it back, and more subtle refusal-removal mechanisms are needed.",

For example, in [this work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08379v2) a quick self-organizing neural network is trained to determine the full manifold of the very concept of refusal and find the multiple most active directions. I think it can help to deal with newer, more advanced models where the refusal is not simply one-directional, and is encoded in complex clusters. They say it the attack success rate even exceeds the most advanced jailbreaks, with less damage to the overall capabilities. They also have the full code [here](https://github.com/pralab/som-refusal-directions).\n\nAnd why did you remove the lora export?

MXFP4 is the model's native precision - this isn't a quantization, it's how it was trained. No overall quality loss, though you can see CoT behave differently at times.\n\n\n\n  This is the aggressive variant - **observed 0 refusals to any query during testing.**\n\n  **Completely uncensored while keeping full model capabilities intact.**\n\n\n\n  Link: [https://huggingface.co/HauhauCS/GPTOSS-120B-Uncensored-HauhauCS-Aggressive](https://huggingface.co/HauhauCS/GPTOSS-120B-Uncensored-HauhauCS-Aggressive)\n\n\n\n  Sampling settings:\n\n  \\- --temp 1.0 --top-k 40\n\n  \\- Disable everything else (top\\_p, min\\_p, repeat penalty, etc.) - some clients turn\n\n  these on by default\n\n  \\- llama.cpp users: --jinja is required for the Harmony response format or the model won't work right\n\n  \\- Example: llama-server -m model.gguf --jinja -fa -b 2048 -ub 2048\n\n\n\n  Single 61GB file. Fits on one H100. For lower VRAM, use --n-cpu-moe N in llama.cpp to offload MoE layers to CPU.\n\n\n\n  Works with llama.cpp, LM Studio, Ollama, etc.\n\n\n\n  If you want smaller models, I also have GPT-OSS 20B, GLM 4.7 Flash and Qwen3 8b VL uncensored:\n\n  \\- [https://huggingface.co/HauhauCS/models/](https://huggingface.co/HauhauCS/models/)\n\n\n\n  As with all my releases, the goal is effectively lossless uncensoring - no dataset changes and no capability loss.\n\n",

On the Mi50s only one card is going \"full blast\" at any given moment. On the P40s with ik_llama.cpp, all cards are going at the same time but at ~80W each. Haven't measured power at the wall, but I'd say the P40s with ik consume about 3x the power vs Mi50. Then again, the P40s are about half the price of the Mi50 now.",

You still have to fit the whole 230B in memory somewhere, which consumer GPUs wouldn't be able to do without some heavy quantization or by having multiple active GPUs.\n\nIn conventional MoE, each token gets to use its own 10B of experts, which means that the full 230B is potentially/effectively \"active\" or \"necessary\" for the purposes of any workload. In other words, you can't just have it use a particular 10B to perform a certain task.\n\nBut you still benefit from having just 10B active per token as that's WAY faster than having the whole 230B active per token.\n\nSo even though an individual token only needs a particular 10b, the next token might need some other set of 10b parameters. You can't just put the 10b on your GPU as a result and call it a day.\n\nBut a decent modern GPU can still speed things up here and you can get decent speed, as long as you have the System memory and CPU to things that the GPU cannot fit.",

I get that it's related but if links to new models are being discussed shouldn't it be a requirement that there be a \"local\" component?\n\nEdit: since this is starting to get some traction I want to be a little more specific with what I'm talking about. \n\nIn the past 2 to 3 days we've seen multiple posts related to new models being released. They include links to API resources prior to weights being released. \n\nI believe that if a post includes a link to API serving hosts then it should be requirement that a hugging face link is also included. If both of these requirements cannot be met for any reason (ex. Weights will probably be released but have not been released yet) the post should be taken down. \n\nThis would at least put some guardrails in place that would make sure posts are closer to the true nature of this sub as opposed to being low-key marketing.",

Genuine breakthroughs (published) that are only being applied to proprietary cloud models today but seem to have a likely relevance for local models a few years from now.  So for example, if there's a news story that a mathematical breakthrough is allowing OpenAI to run inference with 1/10th the hardware as before, well, the potential implications for local in a few years time seems pretty clear.\n\n4.  News about GPUs/memory etc, if made relevant to local can be ok.\n\nThere's probably more but I guess the overall framework is: pure local are the gold standard, and anything else needs to be clearly tied back to local in a real way, even if the model or whatever isn't available to us right now.",

Minimax M2.5 announcement comes ahead of weights release - does it mean we remove the announcement posts as its not \"local\" yet despite it might be in a few hours?

Now to be fair there has also been debates about whether this should be discussed since fairly early on too..\n\nBut my feeling at least has always been that while I very much embrace a local and open-weights first mentality, because of course that's why I am here!, I am also here because I like reading and engaging in smart discussions with other people that share these interests, and if a fellow local AI enthusiast is putting some real thought into a post about something related to the AI ecosystem, even if it's an API only model, I personally would like to hear it. Because what happens on the frontier will end up affecting what is local or at a minimum we should stay informed so we can advocate for or work toward innovations that we want to also see happen at the local level. \n\nAnd I simply don't know of another place like this that has the same kind of proportion of smart people who are passionate about this stuff like here, and so if we ban that I feel like we are eliminating some really high quality types of discussions that I have read in the past here and that I don't feel I can find anywhere else easily.\n\nNow if it were a requirement to have to post with a specific category flair that would be easily filterable I would totally support that as well as a compromise on this issue as I get many people are passionate about it and I respect that.\n\nAnd going back to the low effort stuff.. I do totally agree on a lot of what has been said about these kinds of posts. So yes, if it's bots posting what amounts to an ad or somebody simply saying \"ZOMG FUCKING CLAUDE 5 JUST DROPPED!!!!!\" with nothing meaningful to actually add to the discussion? Then yes, nuke this shit please. I am all for that.\n\nBut, I just hope we can strike a balance between any extremes and still be able to have thoughtful discussions among actual local AI hobbyists while definitely getting rid of the stuff we virtually all agree needs to be restricted.\n\nAnyway, thank you for sharing your thoughts on this, and this is definitely a discussion worth having and sorting out as a community.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI promised that I would update you all with what I was going to do next with the DGX Spark GB10 that I won. It's been a few weeks and I have been primarily heads down on fundraising for my startup trying to automatically improve and evaluate Coding Agents.\n\nSince the last time I posted I became a Dell Pro Precision Ambassador after they saw all of the cool hackathons that I won and stuff I am building that can hopefully make a difference in the world (I am trying to create Brain World Models using a bunch of different types of brain scans to do precision therapeutics, diagnostics, etc. as my Magnus Opus). \n\nThey sent me a Dell Pro Max T2 Tower and another DGX Spark GB10 which I have connected to the previous one that I won. This allows me to continue my work with the limited funds that I have to see how far I can really push the limits of what's possible at the intersection of Healthcare and AI.\n\nDuring Superbowl Weekend I took some time to do a 24-hour hackathon solving a problem that I really care about (even if it wasn't related to my startup).\n\nMy most recent job was at UCSF doing applied neuroscience creating a research-backed tool that screened children for Dyslexia since traditional approaches don’t meet learners where they are so I wanted to take the research I did further and actually create solutions that also did computer adaptive learning.\n\nThrough my research I have come to find that the current solutions for learning languages are antiquated often assuming a “standard” learner: same pace, same sequence, same practice, same assessments.\n\nBut, language learning is deeply personalized. Two learners can spend the same amount of time on the same content and walk away with totally different outcomes because the feedback they need could be entirely different with the core problem being that language learning isn’t one-size-fits-all.\n\nMost language tools struggle with a few big issues:\n\n* **Single Language**: Most tools are designed specifically for Native English speakers\n* **Culturally insensitive:** Even within the same language there can be different dialects and word/phrase utilization\n* **Static Difficulty:** content doesn’t adapt when you’re bored or overwhelmed\n* **Delayed Feedback:** you don’t always know *what* you said wrong or *why*\n* **Practice ≠ assessment:** testing is often separate from learning, instead of driving it\n* **Speaking is underserved**: it’s hard to get consistent, personalized speaking practice without 1:1 time\n\nFor many learners, especially kids, the result is predictable: *frustration, disengagement, or plateauing.*\n\nSo I built a an automated speech recognition app that adapts in real time combining computer adaptive testing and computer adaptive learning to personalize the experience as you go.\n\nIt not only transcribes speech, but also evaluates phoneme-level pronunciation, which lets the system give targeted feedback (and adapt the next prompt) based on *which sounds* someone struggles with.\n\nI tried to make it as simple as possible because my primary user base would be teachers that didn't have a lot of time to actually learn new tools and were already struggling with teaching an entire class.\n\nIt  uses natural speaking performance to determine what a student should practice next.\n\nSo instead of providing every child a fixed curriculum, the system continuously adjusts difficulty and targets based on how you’re actually doing rather than just on completion.\n\n**How it Built It**\n\n1. I connected two NVIDIA DGX Spark with the GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip giving me 256 GB LPDDR5x Coherent Unified System Memory to run inference and the entire workflow locally. I also had the Dell Pro Max T2 Tower, but I couldn't physically bring it to the Notion office so I used Tailscale to SSH into it\n2. I utilized CrisperWhisper, faster-whisper, and a custom transformer to get accurate word-level timestamps, verbatim transcriptions, filler detection, and hallucination mitigation\n3. I fed this directly into a Montreal Forced Aligner to get phoneme level dictation\n4. I then used a heuristics detection algorithm to screen for several disfluencies: Prolongnation, replacement, deletion, addition, and repetition\n5. I included stutter and filler analysis/detection using the SEP-28k dataset and PodcastFillers Dataset\n6. I fed these into AI Agents using both local models, Cartesia's Line Agents, and Notion's Custom Agents to do computer adaptive learning and testing\n\nThe result is a workflow where learning content can evolve quickly while the learner experience stays personalized and measurable.\n\nI want to support learners who don’t thrive in rigid systems and need:\n\n* more repetition (without embarrassment)\n* targeted practice on specific sounds/phrases\n* a pace that adapts to attention and confidence\n* immediate feedback that’s actually actionable\n\nThis project is an early prototype, but it’s a direction I’m genuinely excited about: speech-first language learning that adapts to the person, rather than the other way around.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RYHu1jyFWI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RYHu1jyFWI)\n\nI wrote something in medium that has a tiny bit more information [https://medium.com/@brandonin/i-just-won-the-cartesia-hackathon-reinforcing-something-ive-believed-in-for-a-long-time-language-dc93525b2e48?postPublishedType=repub](https://medium.com/@brandonin/i-just-won-the-cartesia-hackathon-reinforcing-something-ive-believed-in-for-a-long-time-language-dc93525b2e48?postPublishedType=repub)\n\nFor those that are wondering what the specs are of the Dell Pro T2 Tower that they sent me:\n\n* Intel Core Ultra 9 285K (36 MB cache, 24 cores, 24 threads, 3.2 GHz to 5.7 GHz, 125W)\n* 128GB: 4 x 32 GB, DDR5, 4400 MT/s\n* 2x - 4TB SSD TLC with DRAM M.2 2280 PCIe Gen4 SED Ready\n* NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Workstation Edition (600W), 96GB GDDR7",

          "text": "This is AMAZING! I've been thinking about doing exactly this for 6+ months and you just up and did it in 24hrs. Good work! I'm curious if you thought about pushing it a little further with spaced repetition. To combat rigid learning systems, I've tried to resort to making my own by creating spaced repetition decks but was disappointed when I realized just how much work that is. Creating efficient spaced repetition decks is difficult. For optimal memorization, a new card must:  \n\\- Form a sentence of moderate length (to learn in context but not introduce too much unnecessary info)  \n\\- Only introduce a single unknown word/concept (n+1 learning)\n\nFinding the optimal path to learning a target vocabulary is very difficult when you need to factor in those two points. Especially when you consider words as not just words but a combination of a lemma + various morphological features (morphos).\n\nHeres an example:\n\nIn the sentence *\"Yo comí una manzana\"* (I ate an apple), the word comí breaks down as:\n\n* Lemma: *comer* (to eat)\n* Morphological Features: \\[V; IND; PST; 1; SG\\] (Verb; Indicative; Past/Preterite; 1st Person; Singular).\n\nA user has to know the lemma if a morphological feature is new in order to keep it n+1, or all the morphos if the lemma is new...\n\nOf course, there has to be some compromise so we can introduce sub-optimal cards (2+ concepts / single-word card) when a user is starting out.\n\nAdditionally, to optimize review scheduling of known cards, we could evaluate the retrievability (*R*), stability (S*)*, and difficulty (*D*) of a word on the component-level (on the lemma + morphos) instead of just on the word word itself!!!! This allows us to automatically update the review interval of related cards. For example... if you master escribí (*I wrote*), the system credits you for the -í (past tense) suffix. This would raise the *R* value of bebí (*I drank*), and its review would get pushed back.\n\n  \nTheres some interesting research on calculating *R* in spaced repetition for compound cards (cards with more than 1 concept), that says the retrievability of a compound card is equal to the product of the retrievability of all of its concepts. Ex: Retrievability of a word can be thought of as *R(lemma)* \\* *R(morphological features).* This should give a much better ability to accurately schedule cards based on a users learning history.\n\nThen, on top of all that you can incorporate your heuristics / phoneme recognition to qualify the result of a review on a sliding scale based on how accurate & quick it was, rather than just a simple pass/fail.\n\nA very fun problem... If anyone wants to work on it with me let me know!\n\nTL;DR: There is a ton of untapped potential in spaced repetition algorithms for language learning",
