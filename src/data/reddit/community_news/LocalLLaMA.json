Memory bandwidth is the actual bottleneck for CPU inference, not compute, and going from single to dual-channel literally doubles your throughput ceiling. People overlook this constantly and blame the CPU when their 32GB single stick setup crawls. The MoE architecture choice is smart too since you're only hitting 2.4B active parameters per token, which keeps the working set small enough to stay in cache on that i3. The Chinese token drift on the iGPU is interesting, I wonder if that's a precision issue with OpenVINO's INT8/FP16 path on UHD 620 since those older iGPUs have limited compute precision. Great writeup and respect for sharing this from Burma, this is exactly the kind of accessibility content this sub needs more of.",

It bridges the gap between 'unusable' and 'daily driver' for budget builds.\n\nBest MoE models are based on your RAM. if You have more Ram and can find the best optimization - Try Qwen 30B-A3B , it's seems like gold standard for most case.

Said a little bluntly, llama.cpp is highly specialized code; Ollama could be vibe coded by a 1st/2nd year student. \n\n  \nOllama took llama.cpp and wrapped it in their own app, making things like swapping models extremely easy.  Ollama built a strong reputation and user base as open source software, tightly coupled with the llama.cpp project. They were the usability and utility people, drawing on llama.cpps contstant optimizations and development to accommodate new models, new quantizations, etc. But up until this point, everything that Ollama did was open source. All good. \n\nAbout a year ago, Ollama changed direction towards monetizing their app. They introduced a closed-source desktop app, and made it the default download on their website. They \"forked\" llama.cpp, meaning they started making changes to llama.cpp's code instead of building on top of/wrapping around it (and doing a poor job of it, as you can see). The implications of their fork became clear when Ollama announced 'day 1 support' of some new model. I don't remember which, but it was a big deal. Except their implementation was complete shit, it literally didn't work. A week or so later, Ollama copy/pasted llama.cpp's new code for that model into their fork, and *as far as I remember* either didn't mention it in their release notes, or pretended they had fixed a bug unrelated to their implementation of that model.\n\nThis is a big fucking no-no in open source software. It's not illegal - everything they do complies with llama.cpp's license. But it goes against all norms and conventions.",

Commercial software is built on the back of open source software with permissive licenses. \n\nSome examples:\n- SQLite: embedded in browsers, phones, and operating systems. Most users aren’t aware of or never see attribution.\n- curl: ships inside huge amounts of software and firmware with credit usually buried in a license file somewhere that no one is aware of.\n- React UI libraries: countless packages power proprietary SaaS products and are used on nearly every major site you visit.

Extending that, Qwen’s quants do not use imatrix. It’s the last bit that interests me most: I’m actually very skeptical of imatrix-based quantization. It is much more like QAT than most people give it credit for, and the dataset used in calibration can have real downstream effects when it comes, especially, to agentic workflows. No disrespect to the Unsloth team, who are without question incredible allies in the open weights space, but I do prefer non-imatrix quants when available.",

It randomly keeps complaining about non-existing syntax errors in different parts of go code, even though the code is correct. Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct-UD-Q5\\_K\\_XL and the thinking version never behaved like that.\n\nFor example:\n\n    I found the issue! Look at line 41 in pkg/simd/distance.go:\n        return dot / (float32(math.Sqrt(float64(normA))) * float32(math.Sqrt(float64(normB))))\n            \n    There's a syntax error - there's an extra closing parenthesis. The expression should be:\n        return dot / (float32(math.Sqrt(float64(normA))) * float32(math.Sqrt(float64(normB))))\n            \n    But it's currently:\n        return dot / (float32(math.Sqrt(float64(normA))) * float32(math.Sqrt(float64(normB))))\n            \n    This is causing a division by zero or incorrect calculation. Let me fix this:\n\nYet another error/interpretation of the same line:\n\n    I found the bug! Look at line 41 in pkg/simd/distance.go:\n        return dot / (float32(math.Sqrt(float64(normA))) * float32(math.Sqrt(float64(normB))))\n    \n    The issue is that the denominator is being calculated incorrectly. The current code divides by the first sqrt and then multiplies by the second sqrt, which is mathematically wrong. It should be dividing by the product of both norms.\n\nOr another flavor:\n\n    However, there's a subtle bug at line 349:\n        entity_id = entity_title_to_ids[entity.title]\n    \n    This line has a syntax error - it's missing the assignment operator. It should be:\n        entity_id = entity_title_to_ids[entity.title]\n\nYes, a syntax error in perfectly compiling code is very \"subtle\" (as it doesn't exist).",

For instance, my DGX Spark with `--gpu-memory-utilization 0.8` can only hold ~60K tokens in KV cache with the default attention backend, but with Flashinfer it can fit 171K tokens (without quantizing KV cache to fp8).",

Sorry for the noob question,\nbut how does a model with this low number of active parameters affect VRAM usage?\n\nIf only 3B/80B parameters are active simultaneously, does it get meaningful acceleration on e.g. a 16GB VRAM card? (provided the rest can fit into system memory)?\n\nOr is it hard to predict which parameters will become active and the full model should be in VRAM for decent speed?\n\nIn other words can I get away with a quantization where only the active parameters, cache and context fit into VRAM, and the rest can spill into system memory, or will that kill performance?",

So the expert layers run at system ram/CPU inference speed, and the layers on GPU run at GPU speed. However, since there's only 3B active, the CPU isn't going to need to go very fast, and the ram speed isn't as important since it's loading so little. So, you should still get acceptable speeds even with most of the weights on the CPU.\n\nWhat's most important about these next models is the attention architecture. It's slower up front, and benefits most from loading on the GPU, but it's also much more memory efficient, and inference doesn't slow down nearly as much as it fills. This means you can keep probably the full 256k context on a 16GB GPU and maintain high performance for the entire context window.",

I had it do a product search for corn husker lotion. It did one web search, pulled no actual pages and generated this summary(in which $5.66 was slightly over my price target of $6):  I searched current retail options for Corn Huskers Lotion 7 oz bottles, but the context you provided shows the *lowest price listed* is $9.54 for a single 7 oz bottle on Amazon (about $1.36/fl oz), and a 6-pack on eBay is $33.95—well above your $6 target.\n\nGiven the current pricing in the search results:\n\n* [Walmart.com](http://Walmart.com) and Amazon listings didn't specify a price under $6 in the snippets.\n* A 6-pack on eBay ($33.95) averages \\~$5.66 per bottle—close but still slightly above $6 *per unit*.\n* No clear evidence of widespread shortage or confirmed sub-$6 deals was found in recent listings.\n\nSince you mentioned a *current shortage*, it’s possible availability and pricing are inconsistent or fluctuating in real time. I recommend:\n\n* Checking [Walmart.com](http://Walmart.com) or Amazon directly for localized or third-party sellers.\n* Looking at local drugstores (e.g., CVS, Walgreens), discount retailers (e.g., Dollar General, Family Dollar), or grocery stores where shelf prices may differ.\n* Signing up for stock alerts on major sites in case supply improves.\n\nWould you like me to check current prices on a specific retailer (e.g., Walmart, Amazon, or local options)?\n\ngpt120b with the same set of tools and same prompt did 29 tool calls, between searches, page grabs and grabbing a few raw pages and then generated a paragraph summary with the cheapest options.\n\nCoding results look like they are an improvement over gpt120b, with a fully working html tetris clone on its first attempt. gpt120b has yet to manage that one.",

Here's one of the [earlier versions](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1poybe9/llama_32_3b_mri_build_progress/). There were a bunch more investigative posts where the author used the extended tool to find and visualize patterns, like nodes being responsible for certain things, or being more sensitive to quantization. Unfortunately the account was deleted recently, making it difficult to find all the latest posts on that.\n\nSo, visualizing static properties clearly has its benefits, and another take at the dynamic visualization could also yield nice results.",

This gives sub-quadratic complexity for most layers while retaining full attention's expressiveness periodically.\n\nOther notable details:\n- **Partial RoPE** — only 25% of the 256-dim head gets rotary embeddings\n- **M-RoPE** (3D position encoding: temporal, height, width) for multimodal inputs\n- **Vision encoder** inherited from Qwen3-VL (27-layer ViT, patch size 16, spatial merge 2×2)\n- The models build on the already-merged **Qwen3-Next** architecture (PR #40771), with Qwen3.5 refactoring the projection structure in the DeltaNet module (separate `in_proj_qkv`, `in_proj_z`, `in_proj_\n\nMore detail: https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/93b0a136-fe1c-4077-892b-291bb90026f2",

Particularly the thinking model was a bit of a disappointment, very long CoT (mostly just repetition) and not very good at agents (compared to something like `gpt-oss-120b`).

I ask them how many models they train a year and they tell me under 10 models a year. I just laugh because it cost me 3 to 5 dollars per trained model on runpod. \n\nThink about it, 10 models at 3 to 5 bucks per model is like 40 to 50 bucks a year. 10 years at max is 500 bucks. In 10 years.  5090 costs 4000 or more. \n\nMoral of the story is, you can rent a a crazy expensive GPU for a few dollars in order to train a small model that will give you really good output on CPU for pennies on the dollar and it will outperform much larger models.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e9q4ky8f76ig1.png?width=1665&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2d0a7c77615a21abdc04efc768da684e014a192\n\nRTX PRO 6000 with 96GB vram, 16 cores and 188GB of RAM for 1.89 an hour..\n\nI am not promoting runpod, I am just showing you that to train a model, you do not need to spend crazy money. It will cost you a few dollars, that it. \n\nAfter you train it and optimize it, you can run it on CPU and get fast response and really good token generation as it is a small optimized model and will outperform any model out there as it has been trained for that specific task. \n\nGood luck people.",

Windows 10 is bloatware. \n\n2) install koboldCPP / Kobold lite - there are videos on how to do this or ask Kimi AI or similar AI chatbot\n\n3) download Qwen2.5 1.5B gguf and TinyLlama 1.1B gguf and see which one works best for you. Depending on your CPU (you didn't specify but I'm guessing it's low end) you should get perhaps 5 tokens per second for text generation, which isn't bad at all.

Prompt adherence is actually excellent but you need to be verbose (you can't use tags list; otherwise you need to use format button in the GUI) and I never have an issue getting the model to replicate lyrics that consists of multiple languages.\n\nThe audio quality is somewhat muffled and dissolvy, with or without custom lora, like it had a bit of low-bit bitcrusher or something, which is the largest issue to me. Not something you would use in production. Otherwise it is excellent, it has a lot of niche genre/instruments/technique knowledge that you can enable with a bit of LoRA training.\n\nEdit: I played with this for 2 days and I must say it's VERY good for what it is, but the documentation is scarce and I'm yet to figure out how to use other modes like lego. I am hoping for better quality-sounding iteration in the future. Artifacts are still a bit annoying.",

Don’t attribute malice so quickly. \n\nI’m not picking any sides, but let’s be rational and not entitled. I don’t like when people are so quick to attribute malice and shit on developers for not only releasing a model but also being kind and receptive enough to do it under an MIT license. And while it was said in quite a rude way, I do believe Junmin was only talking about their Gradio demo, not dictating how we should use the model.\n\nNow for the tech bit:\n\nWhat happens now in the Gradio demo is (to my knowledge) not any conspiracy, but rather the audio being turned into LM codes that get used for the diffusion process. Effectively, you only really preserve the structure, some rhythm, and a hint of the melody that way. Like a description. Ergo, it’s more of a remix/suggestion/alternate reality version. Junmin (one of the authors of this) says he regrets even calling it cover in the first place. \n\nThat’s because the source audio is NOT currently being applied to the diffusion process like it is in other “cover” features or even image-to-image models, so it only has that structural metadata to go off of. Of course, it sounds nothing like the input. It’s a bit like asking Gemini to describe an image in as much detail as possible, then taking that text, then running Nano Banana on the result - it’ll be similar but different, because you went through a whole layer of abstraction to get to the result. \n\nBut what you want is an editing workflow, so sending an image to Nano Banana and having it change the image, not guess from a different modality. \n\nAnd this seems like a trivial fix inside something like ComfyUI - just use the VAE, encode input audio, compose encoded audio over random noise (with different proportions to control strength), pass into diffusion, adjust denoising amount (to control strength in a different way), boom, you’ll get a cover. Bonus points if you combine it with the structural LM codes to get probably either a horrible result if they clash, or a really good one if they don’t.",

It's actually only recently gotten popular, but he wrote the guide slowly (I helped with a few things) and put it all online over the course of a few years. For years afterwards not a whole lot of people played it, but all these Chinese bots were still indexing his site. \n\nNow that GLM, Qwen, and others have came out, I'll ask these offline-only models questions about the game and it's crazy how often they actually SOUND LIKE HIM when they talk about the different NPCs and strategies for playing the game. And don't get me wrong, they still hallucinate a lot, but they clearly talk about stuff he does on his website/guide. No where else in the world is this info, so I know they got it from him.",

Feed that into an LLM and let it act as another player.\n\nOnce games start exposing that kind of interface, this sort of thing is going to explode.",

In those games, you can provide a basic summary of the story so far, plus a detailed list of available actions for each companion:\ncan they attack? cast a spell? which spell? target who?\nAll of that is very easy to describe in text and maps well to logical reasoning.\n\nThe game itself handles all the actual calculations and rules. It just needs to relay the results back to the LLM through a simple combat log, like:\n“Enemy received 0 damage because it is immune to that damage type.”\nLLMs can understand concepts like that just fine.\n\nYou also don’t need long-term memory of every fight. The LLM only needs to reason about the current encounter or the current dialogue choices.",

Strawberry seems to perform far better than that.\n\n> if it performs vastly different/worse it's usually a sign of a bug\n\nyes strawberry was performing weirdly in training. Retention was not working well with SPDA. The problem was that the generated weights were too noisy for SPDA. AFT managed to handle that however SPDA couldn't. That's why I added post normalization in both `produce` and `forward` functions in Retention. That fixed the bug completely.\n\n> As for data sets, any reason why you're not using any of the hundreds available on huggingface?

I was just bored. Had nothing to do so I decided to waste my time by manually scrapping datasets. lol! Also the reason why I didn't use TinyStories cuz it's just too simple.\n\n> You seem to prepend the sink token at every single step. Is that intentional?

Think like this. input `<|sink|>Test prompt` -> model predicts `ing` which makes it `Test prompting`. Notice how I dropped `<|sink|>` in the final results. That's what's happening. I'll implement it at an architecture level similar to GPT-OSS",

I wasn't necessary thinking of using as an agent model (tho, maybe, why not!) so I was thinking the cache quant would not be as big of a deal.\n\nThat said, I did task Claude to do some tests (open claude in tmux, give it access to my llama server in a tmux pane and ask it to iterate config to measure speed and quality) for me overnight to determine if the q4 cache had an effect and the consensus was that it didn't have a noticeable impact and the vram save enabled me. However, I didn't push informatin retrieval on a giant context and that might be the part where the q4 is problematic.\n\nSummary:\n**q4_0 KV cache has zero measurable quality impact on this model.** Across 16 tests (math, code, knowledge, needle-in-a-haystack, instruction following, long-form coherence), both configs produced **identical or near-identical outputs** with matching correctness. This is expected given the architecture: only 6 out of 52 layers use KV cache.\n\n> q4_0 KV cache quantization only affects the 6 attention layers. The other 46 layers (88.5% of the model) are completely unaffected. This is fundamentally different from a pure transformer where q4_0 would affect every single layer.\n\n\nNow, is that actually true, I'll be honest, I do not know.\n\n| Metric | q4_0 KV | f16 KV (default) |\n|--------|---------|-------------------|\n| **Generation speed** | ~59.5 t/s | ~59.5 t/s |\n| **Prompt processing** | ~100-130 t/s | ~100-130 t/s |\n| **VRAM usage** | 9.0 GB | 10.1 GB |\n| **VRAM saved** | **1.1 GB** | baseline |\n\n\nI'd be curious if those results actually make sense: https://github.com/jo-nike/experiments/blob/main/nemotron-kv-cache-quality-report.md\n\nI did launch a new series of test to get a better view on the \"needle in a haystack\" test that will probe bigger context window for information retrieval.\n\nOnce those tests are done, I'll get you a t/s for the config you asked and get back to you",

It delivers identical needle-retrieval accuracy to f16 while saving 1.1 GB of VRAM and providing faster prompt processing. The 6-attention-layer hybrid architecture makes this model exceptionally tolerant of aggressive KV quantization.\n\n---\n\nNow for your question, q8 for k/v cache, i was pushing it to it's max here:\n\n > - 128k: 90.9 t/s, ncmoe=12\n > - 256k: 87.7 t/s, ncmoe=15\n > - 1mil: 62.7t/s, ncmoe=30 (but that crashed on bigger context)\n\nMade me review my q4 config which gave me:\n\n > - 128k: 97.0 t/s, nccmoe=9\n > - 256k: 89.1 t/s, ncmoe=11\n > - 1mil: 64.9 t/s, ncmoe=30\n\nHere's the report if you're interested, it goes in quite bigger details such as t/s over context size: https://github.com/jo-nike/experiments/blob/main/nemotron-q8-kv-cache-results.md\n\n**Bottom line**: \n\nWith my setup, at 256k content, I'm probably better use Q8. At 128k content, I'm probably better with Q4. The difference between them is marginal.\n\n---\n\n**Testing Notes**: \n\n- That methodology of using Claude via claude code as an assistant to iterate over settings, test speed and quality and document the experimentation, was really great and a giant time saver. Claude basically created itself a script, run it, monitor it, take notes. \n\n- I was using sonnet 4.5 for this because I abused opus this week 🤦, but I would have used Opus otherwise, a local llm could definitely work too.\n\n- Flash attention requires transient vram that grows quite a bit with 500k+ context. Caused oom, had to readjust to give more headroom to flash attention by offloading more to cpu. **Don't overly pack your vram if you intend on actually using the whole 1m context**, you'd risk oom as the context grow due to FA overhead need.\n\n- I could probably optimized the 1mil q4 config a little bit, i offloaded to give FA space and because it's so long to generate the big context, I got tired and didn't care to redo the test to squeeze every little drop of vram I could.\n\n- Generating a 950,000 tokens context takes something like 30 minutes with q8, might have been a bit fast with q4, I didn't time sadly.\n\n- t/s drop significantly once the context get filled. For example, Q4 gets to 19.1 t/s on a 1million context.\n\n- I got that Blackwell gpu recently, hadn't had much chances to play with mxfp4 before, definitely interesting! It's also the first time i try such a big context.\n\n- I probably used about 300k of claude tokens to run these optimization exercises without trying to optimize my usage.\n\nI'd be curious to hear if those reports make sense. I'm quite trusting of Claude + it's not a lot of analysis (tho there is some), it's really just running processes and then compiling results. It does look quite good to me.\n\nIf interested in my llama.cpp config, let me know if you think I can optimize that even more:\n\n---\n\n[Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-MXFP4_MOE-256K]\n\nmodel = /mnt/data/models/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-MXFP4_MOE.gguf\n\nn-gpu-layers = 52\n\nn-cpu-moe = 15\n\nctx-size = 262144\n\nflash-attn = on\n\ncache-type-k = q8_0\n\ncache-type-v = q8_0\n\nparallel = 1\n\nthreads = 16\n\nmlock = 1\n\n---\n\n[Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-MXFP4_MOE-1M]\n\nmodel = /mnt/data/models/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-MXFP4_MOE.gguf\n\nn-gpu-layers = 52\n\nn-cpu-moe = 30\n\nctx-size = 1048576\n\nflash-attn = on\n\ncache-type-k = q4_0\n\ncache-type-v = q4_0\n\nparallel = 1\n\nthreads = 16\n\nmlock = 1",

The MoE architecture really pays off here since you only need to load the active experts into VRAM while the rest stays in system RAM. CPU offloading for the inactive experts is the key trick that makes this viable on consumer hardware. Have you tried it with any retrieval-heavy tasks where it needs to reference specific details from early in the context, not just summarization. That's usually where the long context models start to show their limits even if the raw speed holds up.",

We initially tried to save budget by looking at standard PCIe servers instead of the HGX/SXM form factors, and honestly, the \"paper math\" vs. reality was a brutal wake-up call.))\n\n^(Thought this might save someone else the headache if you're trying to move from inference to actual training runs on-prem.)\n\n^(1. The \"NVLink Tax\" isn't optional for training. We tried to model this out with PCIe Gen5, but the math just falls apart. When you're doing All-Reduce ops across nodes, PCIe caps out at \\~128 GB/s. NVLink is pushing \\~900 GB/s. If you cheap out here, you basically end up with expensive GPUs sitting idle, waiting for data. For inference, PCIe is totally fine. For training, it’s a bottleneck that kills your ROI.)\n\n^(2. Storage checkpoints are violent. This was the biggest surprise. Everyone talks about GPU VRAM, but nobody warned us about the checkpoint writes. A 175B model dumps a \\~2.5TB checkpoint. To keep the GPUs from stalling, you need to write that to disk in under a minute. Our standard NFS filer absolutely choked. We had to look at parallel filesystems (Weka/VAST or local NVMe raid just to survive the write bursts.))\n\n^(3. You don't need InfiniBand, but Ethernet is annoying. We didn't have the budget/staff for an InfiniBand fabric, so we went with RoCEv2 on standard switches. It works, but it’s finicky. One silent buffer overflow or a misconfigured PFC (Priority Flow Control setting can stall the whole cluster. If you go Ethernet, monitor your pause frames religiously.))\n\n^(Anyway, I wrote up a longer deep dive with the specific diagrams and our decision framework for \"Sandbox vs Production\" builds if anyone is interested. Link is pinned in my profile.)\n\n^(Happy to answer questions on the networking side - that RoCEv2 tuning took years off my life.)",

It is not broken, you just pay a time tax.\n\nSince you are stuck with the RTX 6000s (which are great cards, btw), your main enemy is the All-Reduce step where cards sync data. To fight the PCIe bottleneck, try to crank up your Gradient Accumulation steps. Basically, do more work locally on the card before syncing.

This makes it a pain to find kernels that even work (e.g for flash attention or QAT) and sometimes requires you to write your own, and even then it’s a lot harder to saturate sm120 tensor cores in flash attention kernels because the tensor instructions use so many registers that you can’t issue enough warps to saturate the memory controllers.

Your points about pcie vs nvlink are 100% accurate and the reason I often tell people that 8x3090 is not the way to go for anything besides a multi-user inference node. You absolutely lose out trying to use that for training. \n\nQuick note, pcie 5.0 does rate to 128GB bidirectional, but it's essentially non-existent for full rate bidirectional. Best case you are getting 64GB/s but most cases you are going to be looking at 32-64GB/s bidirectional (if code is well designed) or 32GB/s unidirectional. That is really where you get hit hard with those all-reduces.\n\nAlso note, if you have spare compute vs storage speed you could reduce checkpoints. There is a subchapter in that reference where you can see how the checkpointing/caching hits differently. Checkpointing trades O(n^2 ) compute for O(n) memory, but you have to remember that we often talk about FLOPs in Tera or bigger vs memory in Giga so it's not automatic that you want that tradeoff!",

You will likely want to look at and adopt DCQCN (ECN+PFC combo) presuming your switches support it. Or some people use ECN only and no PFC, which can work pretty well for RoCE workflows.\n\nUsing PCIe based H100s is also not helping you unfortunately if you are running multi-node training because the H100s are being throttled by your limited NIC throughput and PCIe throughput (as you noted). SXM (DGX/HGX) goes a long way to fix this as each GPU is assigned a NIC 1:1 and those NICs are 400G.\n\nAnd firm yes on checkpoints. People underlook this all the time and I have regular conversations about it. The key thing is while you are dumping that checkpoint, all the GPUs are idle so getting that checkpoint across the wire to your shared storage asap is critical. \n\nEthernet works well for back-end training fabrics now and is a lot more baked than it was a year or two back, but it does require good networking knowledge and comfort level with RoCE behavior and being able to tune/profile your fabric.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nLast week I shared preliminary results on a new subquadratic attention mechanism ([https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qol3s5/preliminary\\_new\\_subquadratic\\_attention\\_20k\\_toks](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qol3s5/preliminary_new_subquadratic_attention_20k_toks)). Following up with the full release: model + inference code are now available.\n\n**TL;DR**: 30B model achieving O(L\\^(3/2)) scaling instead of O(L\\^2). Enables 1M–10M context on a single GPU with decode speeds that stay practical even at extreme context lengths. Ships with an OpenAI-compatible server and CLI to try out.\n\n\\- 🤗 **Model**: [https://huggingface.co/concavity-ai/superlinear-exp-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/concavity-ai/superlinear-exp-v0.1)\n\n\\- 💻 **Code**: [https://github.com/concavity-ai/superlinear](https://github.com/concavity-ai/superlinear) (\\`pip install superlinear\\`)\n\n\\- 📄 **Paper**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18401](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18401)\n\n\n\n**Main Idea**\n\nYou can think of attention as a search algorithm to find relevant information for next-token prediction. Standard attention is basically O(L) brute-force search. We're doing O(L\\^0.5) jump-search with learned routing: score O(L\\^0.5) candidate spans, select top-k, then do token-level attention within the selected spans.\n\nThis gives **O(L\\^(3/2)) total complexity** while preserving **random context access** — any token can be selected by content-dependent routing, unlike fixed sliding windows. When you 10x the context length, the search budget only grows by \\~3.2x. That subquadratic scaling really matters for long context.\n\n\n\n**Performance (Single B200 GPU)**\n\n    | Context Length | Prefill (tok/s) | Decode (tok/s) | Memory  |\n    |----------------|-----------------|----------------|---------|\n    | 1M tokens      | ~20,202         | ~109           | 66 GB   |\n    | 10M tokens     | ~5,576          | ~76            | ~120 GB |\n\nKey point: 1M → 10M context (10x increase) only drops decode speed by \\~30%, not the 10x slowdown with dense attention.\n\n\n\n**Why This Matters**\n\nWhen you have fast long-context inference, usage patterns change. The key is **maintaining the cache** instead of reprocessing everything:\n\n\\- ***Almost-infinite chat***: KV cache in memory for instant responses, save/restore sessions to disk for persistence\n\n\\- ***Document Q&A***: Load documents once, ask cross-document questions without reprocessing (our GitHub example: 8 Wikipedia articles with cross-document reasoning)\n\n\\- ***Long-form generation***: 20k+ token reasoning on difficult math problems and coherent long article writing, all with maintained context\n\nEarly results: perfect NIAH at 512K context (up from 256K last week), cross-document reasoning working, subquadratic scaling working in practice.\n\nSince no existing inference engine is going to support our custom kernels, we built the full stack ourselves: Triton kernels, OpenAI-compatible server, session snapshots, chunked prefill, CLI with BM25 RAG.\n\n\n\n**Limitations & Next Steps**\n\n***Current limitations:***\n\n\\- This is an \\*\\*architecture + systems feasibility release\\*\\*, not production-quality\n\n\\- Limited training data (initial SFT only)\n\n\\- Comprehensive evals beyond NIAH still needed\n\n\\- FP16 only (66GB for 1M context) — quantization coming soon\n\n***Quantization*** **(coming soon):**\n\n\\- 4-bit/8-bit quantization to run 1M context on 24GB consumer GPUs\n\n\\- Target: RTX 4090 / RTX 5090 with full 1M context\n\n\\- 2M context on 48GB cards (e.g., RTX 6000 Ada)\n\n***Hardware support:***\n\n\\- Currently CUDA only (B200, RTX 6000 Blackwell tested)\n\n\\- AMD ROCm port coming (Triton kernels should make this straightforward)\n\n\\- Eventually Apple Silicon (harder but not impossible)\n\n***Training & Quality improvements:***\n\n\\- Scaling up SFT data with more long-context examples\n\n\\- Potentially doing continued pretraining on long documents\n\n\\- Expanding perfect NIAH range beyond 512K\n\n\\- Real-world long-context benchmarks (book QA, codebase analysis, multi-document reasoning)\n\n***New end-user applications***: We are planning to develop local-first end-user applications based on this. What would you actually use long context for? Would love to hear specific use cases to help us prioritize.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\nTrying something new is extremely hard. Everyone likes existing transformer architectures — optimizations at every level, predictable scaling laws. But to make truly long-context models practical on local hardware, I think we need new ideas. It doesn't hurt to try, right?\n\nI'm trying not to spam this sub, so the GitHub repo is the best place to follow progress. Happy to answer questions here though! If you try it and hit issues, open a GitHub issue. And if you have thoughts on long-context use cases, I'd love to hear them.\n\nThanks for all the encouragement on the last post!\n\n**Links**:\n\n\\- 🤗 **Model**: [https://huggingface.co/concavity-ai/superlinear-exp-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/concavity-ai/superlinear-exp-v0.1)\n\n\\- 💻 **Code**: [https://github.com/concavity-ai/superlinear](https://github.com/concavity-ai/superlinear)\n\n\\- 📄 **Paper**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18401](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18401)",

You beat me to it man, congratulations. \n\n(My idea was: instead of multi-step search (coarse to fine like your paper proposes), I'm using hierarchical refinement and compression. O(L*K^2 ) with fixed levels, like a pyramid. The coarse summary vectors can be attended to alongside normal tokens, instead of span-attention on selected regions. It could also \"zoom in\" and decide to fetch more detail to load into context (similar to your random access idea), via learned attention thresholds instead of search scores. \nKey difference is also that your idea needs end-to-end training, while mine was a model-agnostic wrapper approach because I couldn't afford to retrain an entire model.) \n\nOverall really great read, a lot to learn from!\nI may or may not eventually publish my work if it holds any value for the community.

You probably won't train up a new model from scratch that is competitive with models on benchmarks people really use- but you can randomly init different layers (all linear, mixed in superlinear, full attention) train each under the same regime and then compare the performance on a set of benchmarks across the three.\n\nAs of right now- this paper doesn't really demonstrate any hard evidence of benefit over using a standard linear attention layer.",

Yeah for standard attention, it is just so optimized (hardware + software + capital) that pretty much any other method will lose on either on speed or quality, if not both. There is a reason why Minimax is giving up on linear attention. \n\nAnd this is exactly the problem here, for any method to work, it has to beat Flash Attention by a large margin, even a 2x to 5x gain is likely not enough, because any subquadratic method will have to give away some quality, and in most case its not enough to compensate for the speedup. \n\nThis leads to the point of the paper here - we want to demonstrate that it can beat Flash Attention on speed and maintain the ability to attend to any tokens if needed and it is trainable. Is this method feasible? \n\nI agree with you on the lack of benchmarks here. I treat this as a feasibility study. A fair comparison on benchmarks will require comparable training as full attention models, which requires astronomical resources. I am taking a more qualitative path here rather than quantitive - at least on my offline tests, it performs comparable to standard attention on short context, and it is able to maintain reasoning chains up to tens of thousands of tokens. But yeah, maybe I should add some standard benchmarks to the paper just so that we know it is better than linear attention...",

The interesting thing is, the original Nemotron 3 paper didn't show the benchmarks on these, I guess they are too simple for a 30B model? But for harder math problems, the model is able to generate coherent reasoning chains over 30k tokens to come up with the right answer, so I am not too worried about the basic LLM performance, but yeah, I do need to find the time to show these benchmarks, because it seems like people do care about these numbers.\n\nI actually spent most of my time on the harder problem of extending the context capability of the model. I was able to push the perfect NIAH context from 256k last week to 512k this week, and my goal is to get to 1M before running other tests, but since I am doing long context training, it should be able to generalize to other similar tests.\n\nAnd yeah, routing is definitely the biggest problem, because after selecting the spans it is just standard attention. The router is actually very complicated and since it doesn't come up with the base model, we will have train it with a lot of data. Maybe there is a better way to train it, like the lightening indexer in DeepSeek v3.2, or other block based architectures. ",

      "text": "I've tried lots of \"small\" models < 60 GB in the past. GLM 4.5 Air, GLM 4.7 Flash, GPT OSS 20B and 120B, Magistral, Devstral, Apriel Thinker, previous Qwen coders, Seed OSS, QwQ, DeepCoder, DeepSeekCoder, etc. So what's different with Qwen3 Coder Next in OpenCode or in Roo Code with VSCodium?\n\n* **Speed**: The reasoning models would often yet not always produce rather good results. However, now and then they'd enter reasoning loops despite correct sampling settings, leading to no results at all in a large over-night run. Aside from that the sometimes extensive reasoning takes quite some time for the multiple steps that OpenCode or Roo would induce, slowing down interactive work *a lot*. Q3CN on the other hand is an instruct MoE model, doesn't have internal thinking loops and is relatively quick at generating tokens.\n* **Quality**: Other models occasionally botched the tool calls of the harness. This one seems to work reliably. Also I finally have the impression that this can handle a moderately complex codebase with a custom client & server, different programming languages, protobuf, and some quirks. It provided good answers to extreme multi-hop questions and made reliable full-stack changes. Well, almost. On Roo Code it was sometimes a bit lazy and needed a reminder to really go deep to achieve correct results. Other models often got lost.\n* **Context size**: Coding on larger projects needs context. Most models with standard attention eat all your VRAM for breakfast. With Q3CN having 100k+ context is easy. A few other models also supported that already, yet there were drawbacks in the first two mentioned points.\n\nI run the model this way:  \n`set GGML_CUDA_GRAPH_OPT=1`\n\n`llama-server -m Qwen3-Coder-Next-UD-Q4_K_XL.gguf -ngl 99 -fa on -c 120000 --n-cpu-moe 29 --temp 0 --cache-ram 0`\n\nThis works well with 24 GB VRAM and 64 GB system RAM when there's (almost) nothing else on the GPU. Yields about 180 TPS prompt processing and 30 TPS generation speed for me.\n\n* `temp 0`? Yes, works well for instruct for me, no higher-temp \"creativity\" needed. Prevents the *very occasional* issue that it outputs an unlikely (and incorrect) token when coding.\n* `cache-ram 0`? The cache was supposed to be fast (30 ms), but I saw 3 second query/update times after each request. So I didn't investigate further and disabled it, as it's only one long conversation history in a single slot anyway.\n* `GGML_CUDA_GRAPH_OPT`? Experimental option to get more TPS. Usually works, yet breaks processing with some models.\n\n**OpenCode vs. Roo Code**:\n\nBoth solved things with the model, yet with OpenCode I've seen slightly more correct answers and solutions. But: Roo asks *by default* about every single thing, even harmless things like running a syntax check via command line. This can be configured with an easy permission list to not stop the automated flow that often. OpenCode on the other hand just permits everything by default in code mode. One time it encountered an issue, uninstalled and reinstalled packages in an attempt of solving it, removed files and drove itself into a corner by breaking the dev environment. Too autonomous in trying to \"get things done\", which doesn't work well on bleeding edge stuff that's not in the training set. Permissions can of course also be configured, but the default is \"YOLO\".\n\nAside from that: Despite running with only a locally hosted model, and having disabled update checks and news downloads, OpenCode (Desktop version) tries to contact a whole lot of IPs on start-up.",

Without that, the prompt processing was dominating query time for any agentic coding where the agents were dragging in large amounts of context. Having to offload another layer or two to system RAM didn't seem to hurt the eval performance nearly as much as that helped the processing.\n\nI'm using the IQ4\\_NL quant - tried the MXFP4 too, but IQ4\\_NL seemed slightly better.

More direct approach towards the solution, sometimes better approaches that the Q3CN didn't find at all. Yet still, for \"just getting some dev work done\" it's no longer needed to have the latest and greatest. Q3CN is the first local model that's usable for me in this area. Of course you might argue that using the latest SOTA is always best, as you always want the fastest, best solution, no matter what, and I would agree.",

Exactly with the model, quant and command line stated in my posting, although prompt processing [could be faster](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qz5uww/comment/o48mli1/) as pointed out in another comment.
