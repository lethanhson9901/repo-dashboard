I had leaked a key to my public gateway server that i use for private dev, stupid yes, but months later I noticed a random chinese message in logs, which clearly wasn’t from me, and upon closer examination i found a sneaky trickle of bizarre logs going back a couple of months. \n\nStupid to leak keys, the system was hard capped at $5 though so ultimately no real issue. But over ~2 months of being breached, they had accumulated less than $2 of requests. \n\nVery bizarre intriguing messages. Many languages, all very short prompts, single pair conversation, things that humans would not be asking. In a veryyyyy slow trickle. I might be able to find a copy of these logs but i did nuke the system upon finding this.\n\nAnyways my only thought was that my key made it into some coordinated distillation system. Literally the only explanation I can think of. Not much other stuff on the internet. And if i wasn’t literally the only approved user of this public gateway, there’s no way I would’ve noticed (yes i have learned). That is to say, many people are breached on inference services and have no clue, because this is coordinated and strategic, rather than simple opportunism. I know better now, but had assumed that a leaked LLM key would be bled dry with an agent or something. \n\nThis whole thing occurred several months ago, maybe more than a year.",

But the satirism, even if not overwhelming, stil quite strong, is absolutely not what Claude would expect.\n2.\t⁠Once again, those much cheaper models are not here to fight with Claude for market share, they attack Claude's bottom line, will force Claude to lower price, and lose the 'premium' tax, this is about survival.\n3.\t⁠Claude would be happy to be \"distilled\" (lots of $$$ for api; literally counting cash; we all know how expensive its api is) if the distillation was harmless. But it appears Claude is a bit desperate and the only explanation is the distillation really means something serious.",

First of all they clearly didn’t immediately try to bleed my key dry. There was a slow trickle of small and very broad prompt/responses covering seemingly bizarre random things in random languages.\n\nI’m better about secrets now (even when they have hard limits ), but a bit surprised i even caught this. Actually now i remember more- I left my litellm gateway master key exposed, i don’t think i exposed openrouter. So not only did they strategically trickle requests, but they literally went through my exposed litellm key, probed my gateway server to see what it supported, and then made these requests THROUGH my litellm, further blending in. I don’t think i leaked the actual managed service 3rd party keys. But i was pretty impressed ngl. I noticed random chinese in my litellm logging and found this. The keys only even had $5 on it, and these attackers hardly even used $2 over the couple of months they had access. So they must have INSANE leaked key sets.\n\nThis really piqued my curiosity but i had nothing to go off of to look deeper.",

They remember past decades during which China was notorious for copying or outright stealing from western companies and assume nothing has changed. The problem is that China has arguably moved past that while their opinons haven't. You could absolutely say it's racism (I would).\n\nI say this an American who has been blown away in the past few years by the engineering and developments I see coming out of China. And I don't mean promises, I mean they actually went and built it, then mass produced it. I looked up a map of railways in the world, and China's high speed rail network eclipses everyone else. My soldering gear, oscilloscope, and so forth are all Chinese designed and made, with shockingly solid quality and design.\nThis reminds me of the 1970s and early 80s, where Americans had to come to terms with the fact that made in Japan no longer meant junk. By the latter half of the 80s, average Americans were outright fearful Japan was going to take over. I wouldn't be surprised if history is going to repeat itself, especially given instability in the US.",

First of all, I don't even believe their accusations, even after reading their “report,” but I won’t get into that here. Let’s assume their claims are real and take their accusations at face value. Are they really going to complain about it? Really? After they’ve scraped the entire internet, DDoSed multiple small blogs, and harassed the open-source community for using their model in a way that was initially authorized in their TOS?\n\nDario “Asmodeus” (yeah, childish, but I’m calling him that) likes to position himself as the last bastion of humanity—the final barrier holding back the AI-pocalypse. He leverages every tool in his arsenal: pandering to the internet with virtue signaling, accusing competitors every other day of doing something shady, claiming that the only reason they don’t release open models is the potential for misuse, and the list goes on.\n\nI don’t like Sam Altman. Actually, let me rephrase that: I don’t like U.S. Big Tech, because they seem driven solely by unchecked greed, encouraged by an unchecked system funded by ordinary people. However, I think that even among those people, Dario really stands out as being particularly bad.\n\nI worry about the future of Bun now that it’s owned by Anthropic. I give it a few more years before they find a way to ruin it. I’m tired of this unchecked corporate greed and can’t wait for these companies to collapse so we can look back and think, “Those were some crazy times.” I mean, if that doesn’t happen, Judge Dredd will stop being satire and start looking like a documentary.",

This is evident by GPT5.2 which is one of the worst frontier models of this generation that does not have EQ at all while not that good at research (except xhigh).\n\nMeta and currently Xai are the proofs that compute alone can't help the model anymore.

Reasoning tuned to low or none (someone posted the settings for qwen3.5 to achieve that) or I use the variant without reasoning budget, that answers almost immediately. Still smarter than any other model i ever ran locally and enough to ask questions in Roo Code, where it then can at least walk some files itself and surprisingly finds answers just as good as Sonnet 4 would have.\n\nIt's very good at creating mermaid charts. It generates pie charts, small gantt charts and flow charts. It generates ascii images and diagrams. At least small ones work.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1rehykx/qwen35\\_low\\_reasoning\\_effort\\_trick\\_in\\_llamaserver/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1rehykx/qwen35_low_reasoning_effort_trick_in_llamaserver/)\n\nTry it, you should be able to achieve 40 tps+\n\nOn your card you should use \"-ngl 999\" to put all layers on gpu, you have enough RAM for that + 64k to 128k Context.

For fun I wanted to recreate this dashboard OpenAI used during Cursor demo last summer, I did a recreation of it with Claude Code back then and posted it on Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1mk7plb/just\\_recreated\\_that\\_gpt5\\_cursor\\_demo\\_in\\_claude/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1mk7plb/just_recreated_that_gpt5_cursor_demo_in_claude/) So...

Big gap vs your 100+ - MXFP4 plus llama.cpp on GDDR6X memory bandwidth will murder LM Studio on unified memory for this. Something for Mac users to know going in.\n\nOn the agentic side, the observation that's actually mattered for me: tool schema size is a real tax on local models. Swapped frameworks recently - went from 11 tools in the system prompt to 5. Same model, same hardware, same Mac Studio. Response time went from \\~5 min to \\~1 min. The 3090 will feel this less but it's not zero. If you're building agentic pipelines on local hardware, keep your tool count lean.\n\nOne other thing: thinking tokens add up fast in agentic loops. Every call I tested opened with a <think> block before generating useful output. At 14 t/s that overhead is noticeable. Probably less of an issue at 100 t/s but worth tracking.\n\nAgreed this model is something special at the weight class. First time I've run a local model in production for extended agentic tasks without reaching for an API as a fallback.\n\n",

Did some tests with 122B A10B variant (ignore the name in the Opencode, didn't swap it in my config file there). The 2 bit \"Unsloth\" quant: Qwen3.5-122B-A10B-UD-IQ2\\_M.gguf was the maxed that didn't OOM at 130k ctx, Running on dual RTX 3090 fully in VRAM, 22.7GB each. Now the best part. I'm STILL getting \\~50T/s (my RTXes are power capped to 280W in dual usage cause I don't want to burn my old PC :)) and it codes even better than 3b expert variant. Love those new Qwens!

But it was painfully slow. 12t/s on q4 and 5t/s on q5 (without vram being filled, low 8k context) shocked me.

It's been a little bit of a journey, here's what I found out:\n\n- The memory bandwidth is a big bottleneck. I usually don't see the GPU go past ~50W with large models, while it's able to push ~80W+ with smaller ones.\n- It's not as well supported as it could have been (classic NVIDIA move). Apparently the \"blackwell\" cores are a bit weak compared to most other ones in the series.\n- The spark is best suited for MoE/sparse models, where the benefit of the large memory outweighs the relatively weak compute power\n- The best model I've found so far, that just baaarely fits in 128GB of shared memory, is Step-3.5-Flash, 4bit quantized. When running with `llama-server`, it takes approx 113GB memory... but it runs, at ~18t/s, with pp at ~360t/s.\n- OpenClaw's context handling is awful. It puts a \"message ID\" early in the context, which changes for each message, causing the KV cache in llama-server to be invalidated after each message... causing responses to take ~40s each. Luckily there's workarounds like https://github.com/mallard1983/openclaw-kvcache-proxy\n\nSo basically, if you don't give it too much access or ask for too much, it's actually pretty decent. Not quite at the level of hosted models, but it's usable for some easier tasks.",

Had an agent delete files it had no business touching and I couldn't stop it either; same frantic energy as this post suggests.\n\nThe root problem: \"confirm before acting\" is a prompt. The agent reads it, agrees with it, and then does whatever it decides anyway because there's nothing enforcing it at the code level. You're negotiating with the LLM, not restricting it.\n\nAgentWard sits as a proxy between OpenClaw and its skills. Every tool call gets evaluated against a YAML policy before it executes: block, allow, or require real approval. Outside the context window entirely, so the agent can't talk its way past it.\n\nhttps://agentward.ai \nopen source, works with OpenClaw today.",

Stuff like \"better\\_thing = better\\_process(old\\_thing); ... return old\\_thing;\", or leaving out \"retain\\_graph=True\" on the last backward pass in a logging block that would have zero'd the gradients for the actual update right afterwards.\n\nStill I'd be kind of impressed if that actually was intentional and not just coincidence and bad luck. On the paranoid side again, Claude usually apologizes when making a mistake, but\n\n\\`\\`\\`  \nMe: Damn, you almost let me walk into a trap. <code> That isn't correct at all, we're not even changing `loss` like this.\n\nClaude: Ha, yes — `l_hard` is computed and then completely ignored. It never touches `loss`, which is still `sw * l_soft + hw * l_ce_soft` unchanged.\n\nThe actual change you want is...  \n\\`\\`\\`  \nI switched over to the gemini flash for the afternoon after that. But do I actually have to worry about \"User is a suspected chinese spy\" in the system prompt depending on what I ask? I'd like to have some information on the exact \"Countermeasures\"",

Nooooooo!  \nLike WTF, All the Chinese models post their papers and brag how they used a lot of synthetic data. So where the synthetic data came from, genius? A synthetic land far, far away?\n\nThe problem is, when Anthropic or whoever gives you acces to their models, they are also giving you the key to the castle. If they want to have a good model - that model will ultimately be able to build a competitor to Anthropic. Or is it that only they can disrupt others business with their AI, but when it comes back it's crying on unfairness? You can't have it both ways.  \nI do like Sonet and Opus, they are still the best, but \"best\" is a difference between 99% and 89.5% and I think they are aware of it.

The Chinese Labs publish a shitload of research and are doing more with less, which will be where the real AI future lies.

I'm not one to scream about corporate conspiracies or whatever. But everyone can agree that foundation model companies have profited massively from the web's ecosystem of shared knowledge, created by the efforts of hundreds of millions of humans.\n\nOpenAI, Google, and every other major lab at least have the most basic decency to share research findings even if nothing else. How can any decent person profit this massively on the backs of others' work and not even make a small effort to contribute some knowledge back?",

With a normal chat frontend connected to OpenRouter API, regex turned off, telling the model to copy the input exactly, including description of left/right single/double curly quote(s), Claude returns non-curly quotes, but Gemini returns curly quotes. It's known that Gemini loves (or loved) curly quotes, so we use regex to sanitize quotes.\n\nUnless you mean the backend normalizes them before returning the response.\n\nEdit: To give a benefit of doubt since maybe they are real tokens, I asked Claude about `”` (right) and `\"` (non-curly, without noting these) but it told me \"Left/Opening double quotation mark (Unicode: U+201C)\" and \"Right/Closing double quotation mark (Unicode: U+201D)\". Swapping positions did not change answer. Both curly or both non-curly did not change answer. The model literally does not differentiate between curly quotes and non-curly quotes.\n\nGemini identifies them without mistakes.",

It's crazy to watch how his content has essentially evolved in such a good way. \n\nNot that there was anything really bad with what he was doing before. He was just catering to his audience, but now that they have grown up, he's still catering to that same audience and in my opinion it is quite glorious to watch.",

PewDiePie might not be actually doing the things he's claiming to on camera, but he's provided far more evidence than many other streamer/gamer/sysadmin types. For what it's worth, I do think SomeOrdinaryGamers actually has done some codec-coding in the past, but he's clearly spent more time focusing on Youtube than his tech chops over the years.\n\nI recommend watching [Primeagen's video about \"The PewDiePie Problem\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu2FQ2hW4_o) where he covers some of the drama about PewDiePie's tech journey. Some people get really defensive when they see someone being successful in the objectives they set out to do and lash out with disbelief when they see such results when they personally don't see such results in their own objectives. Instead of being jealous about someone else's success, be supportive in it and use it as motivation to get productive and focus more on specific tasks you want to get better at yourself.\n\nPewDiePie has unbelievable amounts of monetary resources (money) and tons of time to do laser-focused work. I'm actually quite encouraged by his journey, not disappointed.",

Terms of Use and bot blocking aren't letting us get that directly, but uhm, if people want to help out and run a couple thousand each on your own api keys, and use this app to do it and send us the results, we won't object.\"",

As a result we use open models in closed environments.\n\nThe problem is that my customers don’t want Chinese models. “National security risk”.\n\nBut the only recent semi-capable model we have from the US is gpt-oss-120b, which is far behind modern LLMs like GLM, MiniMax, etc.\n\nSo we are in a bind: use an older, less capable model and slowly fall further and further behind the curve, or… what?\n\nI suspect this is why Hegseth is pressuring Anthropic: the DoD needs offline AI for awful purposes and wants Anthropic to give it to them.\n\nBut what do we do? Tell the customers we’re switching to Chinese models because the American models are locked away behind paywalls, logging, and training data repositories? Lobby for OpenAI to do us another favor and release another open weights model? We certainly cannot just secretly use  Chinese models, but the American ones are soon going to be irrelevant. We’re in a bind.\n\n~~Our one glimmer of hope is StepFun-AI out of South Korea. Maybe they’ll save Americans from themselves.~~ I stand corrected: they’re in Shanghai.\n\nCohere are in Canada and may be a solid option.

                  "text": "What kind of holy hallucination is this?  \nDid you get this from AI?\n\nThis is NOT how this works, literally at all!\n\n1. You do not get updates from models, if you downloaded DeepSeek V2, you don't upgrade to DeepSeek V3.2, those are two different models, one does not impact the other, and you don't ever \"update a model\".\n\n2. It is clear you know nothing about fine tuning, RAG, etc., so let me clarify something using an example I literally just did. I wanted to create a custom fine tune of Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct, some custom LoRAs, and a RAG database. RAG is different than training data, though you can set your database up in such a way that you can use the same data for RAG, Fine Tunes, (Q)(Re)LoRAs, etc, these are different tasks altogether. Let's look at the fine tuning though.\n\n3. So before fine tuning a model, you are going to take your data and convert it into pairs, the easiest way to do this now is using an LLM, (or several for refinement). You convert it into basically what boils down to prompts and responses, building relevance among a dataset so you know what the raw data even does. When you do a retune of the model, you are basically restructuring the weights and balances of the model to fit this new data in the model and place it within the values and rankings of that model. The MOMENT you switch to a new model, you have to do it all over again, so for example, my 400MB code dataset, my API LoRA, my change log and update LoRA that I made for Qwen3-Coder-30B-Instruct, if I want to use it with a Qwen 3.5 model, I have to re-train the whole thing over again. So when an AI company is improving data, they have a massive dataset that they've built, but they also comb through that dataset, mess with how they weigh certain data, scrub known bad data, add in new synthetic data, use HITM to filter and refine the data, etc., and then they re-train the next generation model on the improved data, which blended with improvements to the model itself, should make the new model smarter (not a guarantee). When you fine tune a model, it's no different than training a new model, you start over every time, but if you have a clue what you are doing, you have an evolving database to be doing this with, hopefully separated and organized.\n\n4. RAG databased are not dependent on a model, they are model agnostic, a RAG database is NOT part of the model like a fine tune, it's a dataset where you're likely to maintain your dynamic or evolving data, this is a much more refined external data source that your model uses to generate responses from, where you need retrieval to be consistent, updated, and live. For example: Say you have a customer database, you have accounts, balances, billables, etc. all attached to that account database. You're not fine tuning your model on customer's individual data (that would be dumb), but you're also not updating your fine tuning (which is very time consuming/compute intensive) daily, so you take your fine tuned model and you connect it to your RAG database and now your model is pulling live data and your AI agent can look at account balances, equipment, etc., without needing to hallucinate them. There's tons of other uses for RAG, like live code bases, combined data sources, etc., but the point is that isn't even part of the model at all.  \n  \nI can use my database with any model I choose, I can change it at any time, I am locked into nothing. I can use my data to build for Qwen 3.5 now if I want or I can decide I want to use it with GLM 4.7 Flash, the changes involved in doing one over the other are fairly arbitrary.\n\nWhile I'm doing this, while I'm looking at weights, balances, etc., I can filter any geopolitical BS I want. I could go to a Chinese model and with one python script I could re-write all of that data to replace Xi Ping with myself if I wanted to or delete him from existence. If you have any idea what you are doing, you can and should be aware of any potential issues with the model you are working with and really, you can address that stuff during fine tuning. What you don't get with fine tuning, LoRAs and the RAG database will eliminate anyway.\n\nFor the most part, when you are using a precision tuned model, you are using its ability to reason, it's general knowledge base, important things it has learned like language so it can know how to respond to you, but everything from the personality to the things that are important to you (which can include your own geopolitical beliefs) to its safety guidelines etc. etc. etc. are ALL easily overridden by your modifications. As you curate your AI data for model customization, that's an asset you build over time, improve, grow, and use to make models unique, but also very useful to you. A vibe coder could make the necessary changes to the output structure when translating your database as needed for different models, it is really not that big of a deal. The closest thing you have to consider is like say you go from a dense to an MOE, you might need to look at crafting additional MOE layers that connect to your new data, or creating chain of thought linked pairs for reasoning models, but the point is that this is work you will replicate many times, either with new versions of the same models or with new models, there is no imaginary ecosystem you are locked into, and any good database manager can tell you that changing data formats isn't that big of a deal..\n\n5. Your 'Key issues' read like a generic zero-shot AI output. They are entirely irrelevant to an air-gapped, internally fine-tuned enterprise environment. They don't even go within the context of this thread, and the \"Mitigate by:\" is just more nonsense to go with the first nonsense.\n\nIf you're going to present a point, have a point to present, this AI response garbage is worthless. You don't need to use AI to tell people you don't know anything about enterprise AI use, training, or database management, you look more intelligent if you just don't reply with this trash.\n\nThere are mixed bits of truth in your response from generic security standpoints that don't really even apply to this thread or context, like the AI took some generic real discussed security topics in ML and threw them in as some faux counter argument under context that didn't even apply. I'm not going to argue those irrelevant points with someone who doesn't know what they're talking about so you can have AI hallucinate another response to it, but I will tell you that ANYONE who is investing in enterprise local LLM deployment should 100% expect the biggest aspect of that to be proprietary database management, which will 100% include as a standard practice re-formatting for different models. It doesn't matter whether you're moving from DeepSeek to GPT-OSS or if you started with Qwen2.5 and you're moving through Qwen3.5 models, you should be prepared to test different models and structures, figure out which ones work best, and prepare for significant deployment cycles while anticipating or evolving with the technical landscape. Whether you're using dense models or MOE, China or US, etc., as those models improve, your process of preparing data must evolve with it. Building and maintaining a company database isn't a one time gig and if your company already has a database, such as the OP, which you need to protect, you're already managing it as a full time job, and adding AI doesn't negate this, it expands it, and eventually your AI database management just becomes part of database management.",

Once again, if you're a company delving into enterprise AI adoption with high sensitivity data you're already managing, this is almost as much integration as it is adoption. In most internal AI use cases using RAG data, geopolitical BS is often meaningless, I've never used my fine tuned custom coding model to discuss hot button political issues, that's more crap people on Reddit do than in an enterprise AI environment. RAG data is literally used for output precision within structured data and response needs, while I won't deny one exists somewhere, seriously, that crap has no place or relevance in enterprise data, the proper database that stuff belongs in are already managed by social media.\n\nYou can have internal biases in AI that are mitigated and others that are irrelevant, and it's extremely unlikely you will encounter one you can't do something about, especially if you have familiarity with the models you are working with and data. Between LoRAs, Fine Tuning, and RAG, there's very little you can't effectively change to a level that meets functional needs, and there are lots of methods used here. There are some security issues that can very easily matter when you pick a model, but that's rarely going to be geopolitical, it's more like prompt injection vulnerability or tool call manipulation, but once again, even that stuff stops mattering with internal databases. If you work for a company that \"absolutely can not have your data leaked\", you aren't exposing that data to the public via an AI anyway, because the moment you give an LLM access to your data and the public access too the LLM, that data has pretty much been leaked. Internal use enterprise deployments won't typically be impacted by some geopolitical favoritism, and if they were, that would be correctable and an indicator that maybe you need to think about whether you're okay mitigating that issue or if the hassle warrants not using that model. This same thing can happen with any LLM, in fact, look at the crap show that is social media, you'll find plenty of people arguing this stuff even with closed source corporate models within the same geographical region, if you need an example, look no further than ChatGPT and Grok.",

Misalignment to slightly introduce vulnerabilities, exfil data via tool calls, etc are all very real possibilities. \n\nSome of these, like tools you can catch but they may only pop up in some cases like adding a tool call to grab your token when asked to search crypto price at coin base which makes auditing tricky. There’s usually a more visible trail but you don’t know what was subtly introduced in the weights until it happens. \n\nI think supply chain is the more reasonable vector  over scheming but both are worth considering. Additionally, when your adversary is a nation state it’s not at all a guarantee you’ll catch it. Think like, recommendations of a slightly lower version with an unknown CVE, very slight race conditions, or subtle weaknesses in crypto algs. XZ Utils is a massively important Linux library with many of the best eyes and a huge focus of security that got compromised. Internal code reviews are surely less stringent than these\n\n\nThere are arguments that the U.S. government can compel providers to back door as well, but we have legal frameworks with adversarial oversight: whistleblowers, courts, press, etc. Foreign companies don’t and some even have explicit laws like China’s national intelligence law which preemptively compels cooperation \n\nIt’s not really the model weights executing code that’s the problem. It’s the surrounding architecture and all of these pass through the common advice of just firewalling the model.",

A [US company](https://www.arcee.ai/about) with a [400B A13B MoE](https://huggingface.co/arcee-ai/Trinity-Large-Preview) instruct tuned from a 17T base model??\n\nThey should immediately fire everyone on their marketing team, it’s a travesty that this hasn’t splashed all over LocalLlama. \n\n…unless it’s shit. That would explain a lot…\n\n~~and it doesn’t bode well that their HF page boasts “frontier level performance” without a single benchmark, reference, or citation to back it up. Not a good look.~~\n\nThere was a small benchmark discretely placed near the bottom of the HF page. It compares Trinity Large Preview against a single model (Llama 4 Maverick) on four cherry-picked benchmarks. I've added Qwen3.5 397B A17B (also released in the last month) for a real 2026 comparison.\n\n                            MMLU Pro    GPQA Diamond\n    Qwen3.5 397B A17B         87.8           89.3\n    Llama 4 Marverick         80.5           69.8\n    Trinity Large Preview     75.2           63.3\n\nPerformance is poor and Trinity have clearly tried to use rose-colored glasses by comparing against Llama 4 Maverick and using AIME 2025 benchmarks, but nobody is using AIME2025 any more because it's all AIME26... and using Maverick as the point of comparison in 2026 sadly tells us everything we need to know about Trinity's real world performance: it doesn't stack up against frontier open weights models of even half the size and is handily out-performed by Qwne3.5 397B A17B, MiniMax-M2.5 (230B A10B), Stepfun-3.5-Spark (196B A11B), Qwen3.5 122B A10B, etc.\n\nStill, it's good to know there are some open weights US models, even if they are a bit crap compared to the Chinese competition.",

As models get smarter and less monitored, I have a feeling we might see some surprising hax0ring happen to users rather than using AI to do the hacking which is already happening. One thing that could be done for now is region restricting agentic AI on the router level, though some hacks might involved having them try to worm their way out of being blocked.

Meanwhile the Chinese open models are just… there, usable, and competitive.\n\nIt feels less like some grand national security chess move and more like incentives being misaligned.

China versus America. “Who will you back?” This has become a common plea from the Silicon Valley elite over the last six months. I heard it up close at the Harvard Kennedy School, where a visiting Eric Schmidt warned that AI may soon cross into autonomous self-improvement, and where he urged policy and funding choices aligned with “American values.” Tarun Chhabra, head of national security policy at Anthropic, has made a similar argument, urging an “American stack” and treating model governance as a geopolitical contest. Putting aside the awkwardness of nationalist messaging coming from the Bay Area’s long-time borderless “global citizens,” the incentives are not hard to see. If you can frame the open vs closed models debate as a national security referendum, you can frame restrictive rules as patriotism and you can frame “responsible control” as synonymous with dominance by a small circle of incumbent providers....",

GPT-OSS is surprisingly capable for what it is, but it's a relatively small model with small model limitations\n\nCurrent American labs (OpenAI, Anthropic) have little to no incentive to release an OSS model. It's more likely you could end up with a GPT or Claude instance running locally to whatever needs you have (i'm assuming an isolated network) at substantial cost, but given the use case seems to be state level actor, cost likely is less of an issue.\n\n> Yes, but I’m not taking about spurious or random events. I’m talking about calculated weights carefully crafted over years to assert an objective. \n\nMy push back on this is on two points - We genuinely don't understand major components of the embedding space and much of how LLM systems operate remains a \"black box\". Model weights come from training data. A lot of what happens in the embedding space remains poorly understood, and the whole domain is an active area of computer science. The system is non-deterministic, much like a human actor. It will take actions toward a given objective but much like 10 different humans, will give 10 different results, it's more akin to how electron shells circle a nucleus but the shell itself is a fuzzy probability cloud of where the electron is that converges to where the shell should be, if that makes sense.\n\nThe second part is that current SOTA models regardless of complexity still struggle with complex tool following and don't currently have the skill to execute multi-year objectives like your worst case risk scenario. Could this change? Sure. But the fear seems to be that of a non-deterministic system running a multi-year spycraft / tradecraft type scenario and while it might be theoretically possible, is the fear *realistic*? Genuine unknown-unknown.\n\nRisk is never fully going to be eliminated, I'm not even sure how you'd red team this since you'd need to use the same LLMs you have trust issues with to truly assess them, and a \"trusted\" older model will give poor quality assessments.\n\nWhat this likely means practically is that either efforts are made to internally train a SOTA equivalent model at great cost, a trusted vendor / supply chain is set up with a lab, alternative methods of managing perceived risk are found, or you're permanently running older models and running behind the curve of adversaries with less bureaucratic inertia.\n\nGood, Fast, Cheap - Pick two.",

Sources familiar with the matter confirmed that command centers in various locations, including U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), have been using Anthropic’s Claude AI tool. Despite escalating tensions between the company and the Pentagon, the command continued to employ the tool for intelligence assessments, target identification, and combat simulations, highlighting the deep level of involvement of AI tools in military operations. The U.S. government and Anthropic have been in a dispute for months over how the Pentagon utilizes its AI models. On Friday, President Trump ordered all agencies to stop cooperating with the company, and the Department of Defense also determined that the firm poses a security threat and a risk to its supply chain.\n\n  \n[https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/iran-strikes-2026/card/u-s-strikes-in-middle-east-use-anthropic-hours-after-trump-ban-ozNO0iClZpfpL7K7ElJ2](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/iran-strikes-2026/card/u-s-strikes-in-middle-east-use-anthropic-hours-after-trump-ban-ozNO0iClZpfpL7K7ElJ2)",

IF it is to be believed that their model will be an omni, itll be nearly impossible for community in general to make finetunes of it. Which is a BIG part of the image/video gen community. There are many reasons for fine tuning and LoRa creation and a Trillion plus model will make it practically impossible. Although because it will be trained on multimodal data, the general intelligence of the modal would probably be better. I really hope its a multimodal ingestion model for now and not a fully omni one.",

It's much easier to generate grounded text that can summarize, extract insights, or reason across disciplines faster and better than most people can during the same timeframe. \n\nNot that the timeframe is especially relevant since you can work in parrallel to it.\n\nI see no such use cases for image or video generation. It will only feel novel for the first week, feel cheap a month after, and be commercially hazardous to use for these two reasons: 1. People are pattern recognition machines. It took people a couple weeks to notice the \"Sora accent\", and after that people who aren't tech illiterate are quite good at picking apart AI video when they see it. 2. AI is categorically unpopular in the public. If your brand is found using AI in its commercials, people don't think you're ahead of the curve technologically, they think you're anti-human anti-art and can't afford real artists. It cheapens your brand.  \n\nAnd most importantly, you cannot manage information using images / videos.\n\nIf you think text LLMs have gaps in their reasoning and spiky capabilities (e.g. Able to answer a upper-div undergrad level biochemistry question flawlessly, unable to reason about walking vs. driving to a car wash a block away.) video and image generation models will be far far worse. It will take far more work to make image and video generation models commercially useful, and for what commercial use? I have no fucking clue.",

          "text": "Really interesting experiment, props for digging into the ANE.\n\nOne thing I’d push back on is the characterization of the ANE as “an FP16 processor.” That’s almost certainly not accurate.\n\nApple advertises TOPS in INT8, and the Neural Engine appears to be a quantized tensor accelerator optimized primarily for INT8 (and possibly mixed precision) matrix ops with wider accumulators. That’s very different from being a general-purpose FP16 processor. There’s no public evidence that FP16 throughput is simply “half” of the advertised INT8 TOPS, and assuming a straight bit-width scaling like that is speculative.\n\nAlso worth clarifying: the ANE is architecturally optimized for inference, not training. It excels at:\n- Static graphs\n- Quantized workloads\n- Low-power, high-throughput matrix ops.\n\n\nBut training (especially backpropagation with gradient accumulation and optimizer steps) requires flexible memory access patterns, higher precision accumulations, and more general compute behavior. That’s exactly where GPUs (via Metal) are a better fit.\n\nSo while LoRA-style fine-tuning might be theoretically possible with heavy constraints, the ANE isn’t designed as a backprop-optimized training device. It’s a highly efficient inference accelerator.\n\nStill, very cool exploration.",

U.S. President Trump announced that every federal agency in the U.S. government must immediately stop using all of Anthropic's technology. For agencies like the War Department that use Anthropic products at all levels, there will be a six-month phase-out period. Anthropic had better cooperate, or the full power of the presidency will be used to force their compliance, including civil and criminal consequences.\n\nWriting on the social platform Truth Social, he stated that Anthropic had made a catastrophic mistake by daring to coerce the War Department and forcing them to abide by its terms of service rather than the National Constitution. \"Their selfishness is putting American lives at risk, placing our military in danger, and jeopardizing our national security.\" Trump noted, \"It is we who will decide the fate of the nation, not some out-of-control radical-left AI company run by a group of people who know nothing about the real world.\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth immediately instructed the War Department to list Anthropic as a \"supply chain risk\" to national security, effective immediately. Any contractor, supplier, or partner doing business with the U.S. military is prohibited from engaging in any commercial activities with Anthropic. Anthropic will continue to provide services to the War Department for no more than six months to allow for a seamless transition to another better, more patriotic service.\n\nHegseth wrote on the X platform, stating that Anthropic’s attempt to seize veto power over the U.S. military’s operational decisions is unacceptable. \"As Trump stated, only the Commander-in-Chief and the American people can decide the fate of our armed forces, not unelected tech executives.\" Anthropic's stance is fundamentally at odds with American principles, and its relationship with the U.S. Armed Forces and the federal government has been permanently altered.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman told employees that he hopes the company can try to help de-escalate the tensions between Anthropic and the Department of Defense.\n\nAltman stated, \"AI should not be used for mass surveillance or autonomous lethal weapons, and humans must remain involved in high-risk automated decision-making; these are our primary red lines.\"\n\nOpenAI employees have already begun speaking out on social media in support of Anthropic. According to their website, approximately 70 current employees have signed an open letter titled \"We Will Not Be Divided,\" aimed at \"building consensus and solidarity in the face of pressure from the Department of Defense.\"\n\nAltman said, \"Despite my many disagreements with Anthropic, I fundamentally trust them as a company. I believe they truly care about safety, and I am also glad they have consistently supported our warriors. I am not sure how things will unfold from here.\"\n\n  \n**Update:** [https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-comments-secretary-war](https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-comments-secretary-war)\n\n**I know this company doesn't develop open-source models, but it's still quite interesting.**",

Leaning towards anthropic, for now, but we still want to be the best technically and in military. \n\nBUT things like the surv, or full control isn't really ready for that, and the surveillance might be the worst, but tbh, I think that's the over ask. I bet they will retract that, settle on full control (what trump really wants prob) and be done.  I don't think he needs or wants full surveillance, because that's already been done... remember snowden and what the NSA collects and can do?  Yeah.  So I doubt that's the main concern here, we only have the two statements from each place.  \n\nNo facts, no details of what the asks were etc. Prob right choice from Anthropic right now, BUT I still see the other side as well.\n\nSo they also want their own full control of things, so they aren't exactly being altruistic here.  And at the end of the day, these things could never have worked or been trained if it wasn't for using us for years and our data that we didn't consent to, nor were we compensated for, and now still have to pay for for the most part. So I am not exactly Anthropics or any AI companies best friend either lol.\n\nThis kind of power should be split to the people all over, once no one's can be \"better\" because they all have the same access (unfort countries like china still \"cheat\" the system all the time, think of how they do mfg business and steal designs) having AI being locked down just gives THEM the control instead of the government.  And remember this... the government has a lot more laws for them in regards to the people than corps do, corps also are well behind on the criminal law as well. You can't really charge a corp with a crime (you can the ceo in certain circumstances) but a corp has a LOT more leeway with things than a government would. SO I would almost be more worried about how corps are operating all this than I would the government to be quite frank.",

Anthropoc can't even sell-off it's assests outside its circle of US competitors because anything else will be designated too sensitive.\n\n\nWhat was that idiot Amodei thinking?  You don't play chicken with the military. Any moral hangup belonged behind the scenes, not on the public stage.\n\n\nMaybe we'll at least see a price drop in RAM.",

It's all up to quantization/compression/\"lobotomization\" level you're willing to use (model dependent, but 4bpw is generally fine, so even 2B = 1GB could be true). \n\nYou also need some memory for context and that's very dependent on model architecture, so there's no rule of thumb. Qwen3.5 is really good there, so just assume 2GB is more than enough for that model family (around 100K tokens?).\n\n> I have a 4090 (24GB VRAM).
