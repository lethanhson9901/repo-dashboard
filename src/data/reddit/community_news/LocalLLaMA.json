I’m lax sometimes and leaked an openrouter key i used for chatbot dev, and weeks later noticed bizarre logs that could not have been anything other than distillation data generation. First of all they clearly didn’t immediately try to bleed my key dry. There was a slow trickle of small and very broad prompt/responses covering seemingly bizarre random things in random languages.\n\nI’m better about secrets now (even when they have hard limits ), but a bit surprised i even caught this. Actually now i remember more- I left my litellm gateway master key exposed, i don’t think i exposed openrouter. So not only did they strategically trickle requests, but they literally went through my exposed litellm key, probed my gateway server to see what it supported, and then made these requests THROUGH my litellm, further blending in. I don’t think i leaked the actual managed service 3rd party keys. But i was pretty impressed ngl. I noticed random chinese in my litellm logging and found this. The keys only even had $5 on it, and these attackers hardly even used $2 over the couple of months they had access. So they must have INSANE leaked key sets.\n\nThis really piqued my curiosity but i had nothing to go off of to look deeper.",

Really, the only innovation it brings (and I believe it's a big one!) is the ability to use apps that you already use, like Telegram and iMessage, to communicate with it. It feels a little magical when you send a message through Telegram to your \"AI assistant\", and it talks back. That's certainly something that should be copied by other projects down the line.\n\nIn every other way, it's a complete mess. It's very slow. It's buggy. The documentation is so long and yet holds almost no useful information. Clawhub is a disaster that has already wreaked havoc. Its ideas are overshadowed by its frankly terrible execution. Enough that I don't think everyone hyping up OpenClaw has actually tried using it.\n\nBut I think OpenClaw is a very good predictor for the future. I don't have hope for OpenClaw, nor do I think any of its forks will bear any fruit, but hopefully it'll inspire someone to make something way better that actually fulfills the promises that OpenClaw makes.",

It can go use my local network ComfyUI, it can give me morning briefs about my emails, calendar, weather and stuff, it can use context to surface useful stuff, it can build its' own tools (See: Burning tokens like nothing else).\n\n  \nI'm sure much smarter people are actually generating value from it and using it for super cool ideas.

Sure it has vulnerabilities but almost all of them relate to opening it's gateway to the Internet instead of keeping it local host, or accessing sites through it with prompt injections which I consider the users fault mostly. I don't know of any vulnerability that's not tied to missconfiguration, credential leak or the agent accessing a malicious resource first. All of which can be avoided with careful use. \n\nBut what you get in return is insane. A way to code, or manipulate your system, from anywhere. An agent not tied to cursor or vs code or any of that. Full control over it's own system if you build from source. You can build this agent precisely how you want.\n\nPeople even say that it doesn't do anything new that for each it's capability theres X other thing, but it's premier thing that does all of it by itself. You can even ask it to use those very same other tools through the browser if you wish. For example I can tell it to Google or use online Gemini through the browser eliminating the need for expensive api keys. Same with X and reddit.\n\nOh and also, treat it like it's own entity. I don't give it the keys to my accounts, but I create all the accounts it needs for itself. Like it's own email and social media.

OpenClaw’s appeal taking over the masses as quickly as it has is just intriguing for all the wrong reasons. Granted I moved on the day after setting up Claw to work with my WhatsApp because it just wouldn’t work the following day. \n\nThen Atomic Bot was released. That hyperactive little crab HOUNDS me about approving the requests it makes for every task I give it. I approve them as soon as they appear, but there’s some delay that’s causing my approvals to delay in reaching the little bastard. \n\nChatGPT must’ve drank some of the digital juice after OpenAI purchased Claw. Prompted a comparison between Claw and Letta mainly focusing on why one is getting so much attention despite the security issues and length of time in development, while the other is a rebrand of an older project and no one seems to mention (not even the CLI coding agent which I thought everyone was also obsessed with). \n\nAll I got back from OpenAI no matter how I altered the prompt or argued against it, was that OpenClaw is essentially the anthropomorphism of automation. The amount of hand holding that still needs to be done considering is why I still don’t really care to focus on automation too heavily. \n\nThere’s a shift away from automation on the horizon regardless. I wonder if society will remember how to perform the tedious admin tasks that we’ve all worked so hard to avoid? Let the anarchy commence!",

They indexed the entire internet, webpage at a time, developed existential incentive to allow it to index your website (using your compute) to sell you back a product (rankings in their index).\n\nThen, when admins asked for robots.txt there was already financial incentive for you to allow Google to keep generating fake traffic on every page of your website.\n\nThe analogy is fully complete when you try to scrape Google results yourself.  You can't.  They don't allow it.  They lobby for legally enforceable robots.txt as a means to control competition.\n\nAmazon ended up doing the same thing on sales tax.  Staunch opponent of state-by-state sales tax (instead of where you are physically located) until it became clear that Amazon was going to have a presence in each state and already had the internal expertise to handle sales tax, a barrier-to-entry that mom-and-pop sellers don't have.\n\nOn the 3rd/4th time the Supreme Court revisited sales tax jurisdiction in \\~2019, SCOTUS sided with Amazon.\n\nThe grift will continue as scheduled.",

One concrete example is in a customer support voice agent running fully locally.\n\nSuppose the agent handles common requests autonomously (checking order status, booking appointments, answering FAQs). The LLM manages reasoning and decides whether it is confident enough to respond.\n\nA fallback to a human would be triggered when certain conditions are met, for example:\n\n• Low confidence or high uncertainty in the LLM response  \n• Repeated user frustration signals (\"this isn’t helping\", repeated rephrasing)  \n• Requests involving sensitive actions (payments, account changes)  \n• Failure to complete a task after several attempts\n\nIn that architecture, TTS itself doesn’t decide the fallback, but it plays an important role in the transition. For example, the system can smoothly hand off by saying something like:\n\n\"Let me connect you to a human specialist who can help further.\"\n\nWhat’s interesting about ultra-small local TTS like this is that the entire loop — ASR, LLM reasoning, orchestration, and TTS — can run locally with only the final escalation involving a human endpoint if needed.\n\nThis makes hybrid local-first voice agents much more practical, especially for privacy-sensitive or latency-critical environments.",

I could give you specifics but honestly I dropped like 5 small sentences in a python script, using punctuation like \".\", \",\" (well, punctuation), and about 20pc of the time it just goes \"crazy\". Here's one specific example. \"You're on your way to being a domestic dessert god. Saccharon, the god of sugar\". It won't read that properly. Generally, punctuation is how language makes sense, and it's clear that the current training doesn't respect it very much. Maybe fine tuning it with literary audiobooks would help, not sure how you train such model, but punctuation is nuance, and critical. I haven't converted enough text to see if the model hallucinates, because in its current state, the overriding of basic punctuation makes it not good enough for me. Fwiw, my use case is turning books I will never take the time to read into audio that i can listen to while cooking and stuff, so I can't have something that hallucinates, but step 1, I need it to respect punctuation. In fact, having the option to force hiatus / silence with some code would probably be great, but on other models i know it tends to break the flow completely and isn't really is usable. Best of luck to the team!",

There are probably enough companies that are stupidly paranoid about Chinese models and won't have their legal, compliance and risk sign off on those.

Do you think the labs love releasing huge models if they can release smaller ones?  Do you think they want to release the smartest small model yet be crushed by big models?   Case in point see gemma and mistral, they are very great and pack quite the bunch of under 30B.  Yet how come you are not talking about it and going crazy for it?  You want GLM5 in small size, you want Qwen3.5 in small size or DeepSeek4.  If they labs could, they would, they are not there yet.\n\nSo they go big because matching up and being as good as the pros OpenAI, Google and Anthropic is what is going to keep the bills paid for them.    Those of us that can run such models are very excited because we have true alternative to SOTA commercial models.  I run these models, but slowly, sometimes I'm getting 3tk/sec, and that's the cost and reflects the size of my pockets.    I have seen many posts of people who could also run it, but they say no.  They want it at 20tk/sec or more.  \n\nFor folks getting these models for free, we are quite the spoiled bunch.  We better enjoy it because I can promise this community.  One day ALL OF THEM WILL GO CLOSE.  THERE will be no more free models.  NONE!   The only way we would have one would be a non profit that gets donation and trains one, something like [Allen.ai](http://Allen.ai)",

It worked out that 1 minute of average fast charging uses almost exactly as much electricity as 1 hour of AI model training on one 8xH100 node. It was weird how even the units were.\n\nIt seems that one EV fast charging uses as much power as 60 8xH100 systems. At a typical 4 nodes per rack, that's 15 racks worth. That's pretty insane.\n\nI'm not even sure how many concurrent users that much compute could server... In my benchmarks on a 8x4090 system running vllm for oss-120b, I had it doing 20-100 concurrent at acceptable rates, so I would imagine commercial inference on Hopper or newer are getting much higher than that per node. Meanwhile the other was just a single average EV sitting there with the AC on while charging.\n\nA friend also converted these in to tree and tea cup equivalents.\n\n> Making a bunch of shitty assumptions on the side of error, one \"average\" tree seems to be around 4000kWh, which is around 2.5 weeks worth of 8xH100 time.\n\n> A single 4090 running at 100% power limit [which it won't for inference] is something like 0.001 kWh per minute for the entire PC. For reference, an electric tea kettle consumes around 0.017 kWh per minute. So you're looking at maybe 1/100th of cup of tea per second of generation. Its possible local gen is more energy efficient than your average British person's leaf broth addition.",

I mean, wtf kind of logic is that?  No western country will ever invest in Chinese hardware of that capability even if it's not outright banned and it also assumes Nvidia is just going to lay back and say \"oh sorry, we're done making stuff opps\"\n\nCompetition is great, regardless of where it comes from, but China will never have hardware domination *in this space*.\n\nWhat kills me is that NVidia has more revenue and RD investment than they could have ever imagined, do you think they are just having parties and buying lambos?

Just two years ago, I barely could trust a model produce part of code after detailed prompt... now with K2.5 I can let it be for hours and it orchestrates entire project according to specs that it can read and discover on its own, can use web browsing and vision.\n\nBut current AI barely scratches the surface... most obvious things, there is still no large model of K2.5 scale that supports input-output across image, video and audio modalities. There is no production models yet that reason in non-text tokens (like using images/animation/audio in thinking). There are some experimental architectures that take thinking out of text token space while processing video, so clearly that's possible, but it will be a while before something like that goes into production-ready architectures. Each step forward gives a lot of advantages so I don't think pushing AI forward is going to stop, at most it may slow down later on, when most \"low hanging fruits\" are discovered.",

And I'm 'pro-local models'.\n\nThis dude (@-\\_XD) seems particularly dumb, almost everyone I know who I would describe as an AI hater knows you can run smaller models locally, clearly they have no idea how any of this works and are just an idiot. And obviously as long as people can still run local open source models and keep improving them, then that isn't going away. If anything, I see no reason why running local models won't become even more attractive in the future. After the initial bubble pop of AI (lets face it there's way too much money in this to justify) and the cost of hardware comes back down, I suspect local AI might be the direction a lot of things go.\n\nI'm not even a hater in the sense that I don't like the technology, I think it's impressive technology and has great uses (like statistical analysis of huge data sets, or natural language searching of huge dumps of text). I just don't like it being used for art, I hate that my social media feeds are full of generated AI slop, I hate seeing it being used to do stuff like undress kids, and I don't like folks vibe coding entire pieces of software with it. And I hate seeing AI companies trying to convince other companies that their autocomplete on steroids is smart enough to replace thinking feeling real humans, and trying to will into existence a world of mass unemployment where everything is replaced with AI slop.\n\nBut most of all, I have major problems with the ethics of how it is being built from public data in such a way that it creates a one sided exchange where corporations are basically saying they can take anything anyone creates, tutorials, websites, books, digital art, 3d models, movies, youtube videos, novels, reddit posts, family photos, anything, to use to create a valuable product (their AI models) which they can then sell, but apparently if I download a copy of a movie from 1963 to watch, I'm a criminal? Why is it OK that OpenAI or NVIDIA can take artworks I create or novels I write, and train AI from it? [At the same time, these companies have the nerve to then complain about people 'stealing' their IP by taking prompts and responses from their models and using them to train new models.](https://futurism.com/future-society/google-copying-ai-permission)\n\nI feel like this is creating a society where no one will have any incentive to share anything and a heavily one sided unfair situation where corporations are getting all the value out of an exchange we have no choice but to enter and we're getting nothing from. Why should I write and publish a book, and put 9 months worth of work into it to source genuine real information I've validated extensively with research, when it will just be sucked up into an LLM and I won't even get any credit for it? Let alone anyone asking for my permission, or paying me for the work I did. A day after I publish a book, someone is going to be publishing a book which just takes everything I wrote and rephrases it with an LLM and combines it with 3 other books that they generated in under an hour for probably a buck of compute. What incentive do I have to make books? \n\nWhat happens when there's no incentive for ***anyone*** to make books?\n\nIf anything I think people using open source models trained on open source data sets, running locally, is 'the best case outcome' in a world where this stuff never goes away, because at least then people aren't paying subscriptions to trillion dollar corporations to access closed models created from stolen copyrighted material. It's still not a great situation ethics wise, but it's better at least, so.... So, yeah, Local FTW.",

The bottleneck isn't the interface, it's the decision-making.\n\nOn running your own model — I'd love to make it open, but if the simulation internals are public, new models will just train on it and the benchmark loses its value.

They'll confidently make a choice that looks locally optimal but creates a cascade 5 steps later. Basically the same thing as taking a loan that looks reasonable on day 1 but kills you by day 15.\n\nThe Gemini Flash infinite decision loop is also very real btw.

As diseases get cured, drugs become superfluous.  \n\\- Mix multiple cures for higher prices  \n\\- Engage in some unethical behaviour. Like deliberately not curing to keep a larger market, or questionable marketing campaigns such as bribing doctors.\n\nThat said, the game has a bit of an exploit because if you mix drug effects you can get people to pay $4000 for their cold medicine rather than $60, because it can also cure cancer and HIV, even though you might just be having a cold.\n\nIf you patched out that exploit (by making competition work against it: people will prefer to buy something much cheaper) then it becomes a lot more interesting!

Strategic notes, general notes — it can read all of it and most models do. There are also tools to pull sales history, competitor data, everything. All described in detail in the tools section on the site.\n\nNow if you're talking about meta-learning — where the model draws conclusions from a completed run and gives itself clear instructions for the next one — that's a whole separate topic.

It's been a little bit of a journey, here's what I found out:\n\n- The memory bandwidth is a big bottleneck. I usually don't see the GPU go past ~50W with large models, while it's able to push ~80W+ with smaller ones.\n- It's not as well supported as it could have been (classic NVIDIA move). Apparently the \"blackwell\" cores are a bit weak compared to most other ones in the series.\n- The spark is best suited for MoE/sparse models, where the benefit of the large memory outweighs the relatively weak compute power\n- The best model I've found so far, that just baaarely fits in 128GB of shared memory, is Step-3.5-Flash, 4bit quantized. When running with `llama-server`, it takes approx 113GB memory... but it runs, at ~18t/s, with pp at ~360t/s.\n- OpenClaw's context handling is awful. It puts a \"message ID\" early in the context, which changes for each message, causing the KV cache in llama-server to be invalidated after each message... causing responses to take ~40s each. Luckily there's workarounds like https://github.com/mallard1983/openclaw-kvcache-proxy\n\nSo basically, if you don't give it too much access or ask for too much, it's actually pretty decent. Not quite at the level of hosted models, but it's usable for some easier tasks.",

Promethease is good at giving \"too much data\", as in, lots of genetic variants associated with lots of stuff with varying levels of strength, with references to the papers the associations were found in. So you might want to turn your model loose on the references too. Sometimes it will show you contradictory associations (gene A makes you more likely to get blah, gene B makes you less likely), so you'd want it to compile some disease/trait summaries for you while it's at it or the RAG might just seem schizophrenic depending on which individual gene report it references.\n\nI'm just speculating though. I never thought to digest my promethease data with a local model until you asked the question.\n\nPromethease is just single gene associations, though. I'd prefer to get some polygenic scoring done, and I think the SNP arrays used by 23&Me actually have enough raw data for it. I'd definitely need a model to talk me through how to set that up.",

For serious professional workflows or RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with massive contexts, you’ll easily burn through $500–$1,000/month in API tokens. At that rate, a high-end local rig pays for itself in less than a year.\n\nThe Multiplier Effect: A single powerful local setup (like a fully specced Mac Studio or a multi-GPU rack) can serve 4 or 5 developers simultaneously. It might be slightly slower than a dedicated cloud H100, but the total cost of ownership (TCO) drops to almost zero after the initial investment.\n\nPrivacy & Stability: Beyond cost, you aren't subject to \"stealth nerfing\" (model updates that break your prompts) or downtime.\n\nBottom line: For a single casual user? Stick to the $20 sub. For a small team or intensive automated workflows? Local hardware isn't just a \"niche hobby,\" it's a financial no-brainer.",

The trick is we have to use app to multi-shot with our own input data. But Gemini only need to use 1 shot since they might already have the tools inhouse to collate before giving you the answers. I think most online chat we are seeing should be using the same method. Tool calls to get data before responding to you. Skills are now the rage and you can use tools and skills to match the frontier models. For reasoning, it's basically the same but with more turns.\n\nThen you can add the other component of the app like Memory, persistent data, cronjobs to run, etc etc. \n\nBasically , OpenClaw is doing that but you need the frontier models because they can code the skills better.",

I'm not going to waste my limited token budget on having the paid model read through papers all the time.  \nI tell the agent what I value, and the agent can read through papers all night, moving the most relevant papers into a folder, and give an overview and critique for each paper. I'll still read the top papers myself, but I can go in knowing that it's *likely* not a complete waste of my time, and I can have an idea of the scope of the paper.   \n   \nFor CS/graphics stuff, I can also have the model write an implementation of whatever the paper is talking about, if there's not already code associated with it.  \nThese days there *shouldn't* be any CS/ML/AI/computer graphics papers without code, but somehow it's still a thing sometimes.   \n   \nPretrained local LLMs are also basically the only way for most researchers to investigate the internals of a trained model and experiment with how they operate under various conditions in a controlled way.  \nBeing able to examine attention patterns and watch how the embeddings change layer by layer has helped solidify my understanding of how these models work.   \n   \nFor both image models and LLMs, it's also pretty great to be able to fine-tune on whatever data you want. LoRas are invaluable, it's functionally the only way regular folk can get what they need without needing to train a full model. \n   \nAnd really just being able to goof off without running afoul of some corporate nonsense rules.",

And I feel like the more likely misunderstanding would have been \"why isn't Kimi manchurian\" as follow up to the first question.

So there must be some kind of mix and matching of languages and concepts and I think it'd be interesting to see how it actually interpreted that. Or if there is possibly something in the system prompts (or training) that weight so heavily on its completions that it ends up with that response. ",

It includes an algorithm that, based on a small annotated dataset (e.g. n=10), finds the k most correlated dimensions. Based on this i've been able to flip these dimensions and qualitatively verify that the transformation actually did change the gender of the voice. But there is no 'one gender dimension' per se (rather multiple that make up this) but it can be achieved by using sparse autoencdoers which ive been experimenting with as well.",

          "text": "The fact that voice identity reduces to a 1024-dimensional vector that you can do arithmetic on is genuinely fascinating. Voice averaging and emotion space interpolation opens up some wild possibilities for personalized TTS that goes way beyond simple voice cloning.The practical implication that excites me most: you could theoretically build a voice continuum slider in an app — drag between \"professional\" and \"casual\" or \"calm\" and \"energetic\" and get smooth, natural-sounding transitions rather than switching between discrete voice presets.Great work extracting the standalone embedding model. Making it ONNX-compatible for browser inference is the kind of practical contribution that actually gets stuff adopted.",

I use openclaw daily now and have been doing more programming in the last week than I've done in the last ten years. I'm a former sysadmin so I wrote scripts all of the time, but my openclaw is automating and doing all the same stuff much much faster than I could and documenting it much better than I ever did.\n\nJust this morning I've been having it working on some recompiling stuff for specific hardware that I couldn't have even touched back in the day, let alone last week. I do think it's paradigm-shifting, but I also think that it is going to take very technical people to do very complex stuff with it. Still, the people who are AI-averse are going to fall behind. I'm not saying that as a hype mechanism but more as an observation. I believe AI-as-a-personal-assistant is going to be an important part of the evolution. \n\nBut yeah, I also agree that the hype has been kind of weird. Just remember, NFTs were hype, but Bitcoin and a few other cryptos did have staying power. Maybe OpenClaw is the hype, but I think personal AI assistants are going to have staying power. It's finding the stuff that is going to stick and stay around that is important.",

I’m surprised he didn’t have it named Audrey, slinging coffee.\n\nAnyway, for some I get the sense openclaw was their first experience with a Claude code like agent. Most people aren’t you or I. I grew up in terminals in the 80s and 90s. Sitting here with half a dozen terminals open feels like it’s the 90s and I’m Mudding again. You probably did the same :p. We were fucking with and tuning AI early. I distinctly remember your early models (including the attempt to save Sydney). We’ve been watching this coming, but put yourself in the shoes of someone who sees chatgpt as AI, and then you show them Claude code with a silly front end wrapper on it. They’d shit a brick.\n\nThings are gonna get weird, man.",

That means you'll see all kinds of people... for better or worse. But at the same time, everyone's there: freelancers, artists, DIY creators, actors... you name it.\n\nThe whole world feels connected, too. I get a lot of Japanese photography content, for example, and Grok can translate it with one click. When I like something, the algorithm feeds me more art and similar stuff, it's actually pretty easy to \"train/condition\" it to show you what you want. Muting, for example, has a strong 'negative impact' on related content. The algo filters out similar posts much more aggressively once you mute something.\n\nThe chatting system is great as well. If you get close with someone, or if you're discussing a freelance job or something, the chats feel smooth and natural.\n\nidk, man, I just really like Twitter/X. It feels like the best place right now. Even politically, which I've mostly stopped engaging with, it's good in the sense that you can actually see both sides of the aisle.\n\nAs much as I used to love Reddit, it feels dead to me. Reddit kind of died around 2016, at least from my perspective. Despite its flaws, X is the only place left where you can actually have an argument if you want to, unlike Reddit, where it feels like you're risking a permanent ban at every step.",

But honestly, the 'power hungry' critique is a bit overblown i guess unless you're running a full rack—for a single card doing inference, the efficiency difference vs. newer hardware isn't a deal-breaker. The real killer is the fragmentation; trying to scale with multiple 3090s for a unified model becomes a software nightmare fast.",

You get the capacity but trade tokens per second. A 3090 at 24GB doing 70B in Q4 will often outrun a CPU plus 256GB RAM setup on throughput. Different tool for different jobs.",

MXFP4 will be better than Q4\\_0 simply due to the fact that Q4\\_0 is integer quantization, while MXFP4 is float quantization.\n\n  \nMost of the weights and activations of LLMs are closer to zero and just some of them differ in magnitude. Interestingly, we don't need to have low error for these high magnitude weights/activations -- we only need them to differ from all of the others. Conversely, since most of the w/a are of low magnitude, we need to differentiate between them.\n\nFP4 quantization (MXFP4, NVFP4) have relatively low quality for high magnitude values, since there are not a lot of values that can be represented in fp4, but they have much higher amount of representable values for lower magnitude. In contrast, Int4 have more or less uniform distribution of representable values, having bigger gaps around zero.\n\nIn images, this is just what we need. Int4 quantizes pixel values in high contrast images in aesthetically pleasing way. FP4 clamps higher values, while retaining much higher precision around zero -- but since the images are high contrast with wide histogram of colors, it looks bad. LLMs have a different value distribution, thus, FP4 wins against Int4 (Q4\\_0).\n\nTLDR: Images and weights/activations of LLMs have different value distributions, thus, FP4 is optimal for quantizing LLMs and images are a bad visualization tool.",

In general I advise against using MXFP4 for quantizing a model unless it is known for sure that the original was QAT'd targeting that specific type of MoE tensors.\n\n> But don't get excited about using mxfp4 to quantize other models to fp4. The zero-bit mantissa in the block scales, along with the E2M1 choice for the 4-bit floats, results in a horrible quantization accuracy for the 4.25 bpw spent (about the same as IQ3_K), unless the model was directly trained with this specific fp4 variant (as the gpt-oss models).\n> https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/pull/682\n\nYes on some models it is possible to see lower \"better\" perplexity than the baseline for 4~6bpw quantizations including but not limited to MXFP4. The recent GLM-4.7-Flash did have unusually low perplexity, lower than the full baseline bf16, but that doesn't mean it is \"better\" though, just an anomoly.\n\nSo it is good to look at u/Digger412 (AesSedai on hf) KLD data in combination with PPL to get a full view when this kind of anomaly happens.\n\nSome have argued MXFP4 is faster on their specific rig, if that is true then they might also look into Q4_0 and Q4_1 which get quite a bit of love in the vulkan backend etc.",

They chose a small model intentionally as proof of concept. Well, it worked out really well, it runs at 16k tps! I know this model is quite limited but there likely exists a group of users who find it sufficient and would benefit from hyper-speed on offer.\n\nAnyways, they are of course moving on to bigger and better models, but are giving free access to their proof-of-concept to people who want it.\n\nMore info: [https://taalas.com/the-path-to-ubiquitous-ai/](https://taalas.com/the-path-to-ubiquitous-ai/)\n\nChatbot demo: [https://chatjimmy.ai/](https://chatjimmy.ai/)\n\nInference API service: [https://taalas.com/api-request-form](https://taalas.com/api-request-form)\n\nIt's worth trying out the chatbot even just for a bit, the speed is really something to experience. Cheers!\n\n  \nEDIT: It's worth noting that the chatbot demo actually undersells the speed on display. Anything over a few hundred tps is perceived as instantaneous, so the experience of 1k tps vs 16k tps should be pretty similar. So you are only seeing the bottom few percent of the speed on offer. A proper demo would be using a token-intensive workload with their API. Now THAT would be something to see.",

The companies that train the models need more general hardware, but there will be companies vying for cheap inference, so they'll be paying the up front costs for factory tooling. Once the factory is in place, churning out units is very cheap, so if they make them available to the public rather than having very strict deals with companies, the price should come down over time as more and more units are produced.\n\nAnd then someday, people will literally just be throwing these away because Deepseek V10 is available and V4 is outdated.",

Size is the big issue.\n\nThe H100 has about 80-billion transistors.  Ask yourself how many transistors are needed for each model weight. You need shifts and adders, clocks and control logic along with all that SRAM\n\nEven if you're getting 330M transistors/mm² on a 2mm process node and using an 850mm² chip, that's only 280B transistors.\n\nEach parameter needs on the order of 50–100 transistors depending on the quantization level, which means they're likely bumping up hard against the limits of physics getting a 3B model on a chip right now. \n\nIt would require a Cerebus-style wafer-scale solution to move beyond the reticle-limit, this would allow them to move up to 7B or 8B parameter models. \n\nIf they packed an entire wafer with transistors, about 70,000 mm², they could in theory, pack about 23T transistors, which, depending on sparsity, architecture, quantization, etc puts us in the realm of 250B–500B models, on the entire wafer.\n\nYields would be absolute shit.

Bob was known far and wide for his incredible ability to burp the alphabet. It was a skill he had honed to perfection, and he could burp the entire alphabet in under 5 minutes.\n\n>But Bob was not just a one-trick pony, oh no. He was also a master of the ancient art of Extreme Ironing. He would take his ironing board to the most extreme locations on Earth, like the top of a moving train or the bottom of the ocean, and iron his clothes with ease.\n\n>One day, Bob received a letter from the King of Plootz, asking him to come to the castle and show off his burping skills in front of the entire kingdom. Bob was thrilled. He packed his ironing board, his alphabet-prefecting skills, and his trusty can of soda, and set off for the castle.\n\n>When he arrived, he was greeted by the King himself, who was so impressed by Bob's burping that he awarded him the Golden Sock of Plootz. Bob was overjoyed and spent the rest of the day burping and ironing for the adoration of the crowd.\n\n>But little did Bob know, his arch-nemesis, the evil Count of Blorple, had been secretly training a team of ninja warriors to steal the Golden Sock and take over the kingdom. And so, Bob's big day turned into a big mess, as the Count's ninjas snuck into the castle and stole the Golden Sock, leaving Bob to ponder the meaning of it all, and wonder why on Earth did he ever get into Extreme Ironing...\n\n>  \nGenerated in 0.023s • 15,759 tok/s\n\nI am not used to seeing that much text showing up this quickly",

      "text": "Hey r/LocalLLaMA,\n\nSo I live in Ukraine during the war. Power goes out a lot here – russia regularly attacks our power grid. When it happens, internet dies, cell towers go dark, and suddenly all my smart home stuff and AI tools become useless. Got tired of it, so I did something kind of ridiculous.\n\nI bought two Lilygo T-Echo radios (\\~$30 each, LoRa 433MHz, running Meshtastic firmware). Plugged one into my always-on Mac mini via USB. Took the other one as my portable radio. Then I opened up my OpenClaw AI agent and basically said: \"hey, there's a Meshtastic radio plugged in. Figure it out.\"\n\nAnd it did.\n\n# What happened next\n\nIt identified the Meshtastic device, installed the CLI, configured an encrypted channel, and then – without me writing a single line of code – built a full Python listener daemon that:\n\n* Monitors the radio 24/7 for incoming messages\n* Routes them intelligently: if internet is up, forwards to Discord where a cloud AI responds. If internet is down, routes everything to local models via Ollama\n* Uses phi4-mini as a lightweight intent classifier (\"is this a smart home command or a question?\") and gemma3:12b for actual answers ()\n* Talks to Home Assistant so I can control lights, read sensors, check who's home — all over radio\n* Auto-chunks responses to fit the 200-char LoRa limit\n* Watches an outbox folder – if the AI needs to alert me about something (like a power outage), it drops a message file there and the listener transmits it over LoRa\n\nThe whole thing just worked. The AI had already built the architecture while I was still thinking about how to approach it.\n\n# The voice thing (this is the cool part)\n\nThen I added one more feature. If I prefix a Meshtastic message with `SAY:`, the listener takes the text, calls Home Assistant's TTS service, and plays it through my HA Voice PE speaker at home. In Ukrainian.\n\nSo I can be walking around with a T-Echo in my pocket, completely off-grid, type `SAY: Привіт, я скоро буду вдома` (Hi, I'll come back home soon) – and my house literally speaks. No internet anywhere in the chain. Just radio waves → Mac mini → TTS → speaker.\n\nHonestly didn't expect it to feel this magical.\n\n# The stack\n\nEverything's open source except Claude (which is only used when internet is available):\n\n* **OpenClaw** – you know what is this \n* **Meshtastic** – LoRa mesh networking firmware. The magic sauce for off-grid communication – open source, encrypted, and any Meshtastic radio can relay messages to extend range\n* **Lilygo T-Echo** – the $30 radio hardware running Meshtastic\n* **Ollama** – you know as well\n* **phi4-mini** – lightweight router/classifier\n* **gemma3:12b** – the actual brain for offline responses\n* **Home Assistant** – smart home + TTS\n* **HA Voice PE** – the speaker that reads messages aloud\n* **Mac mini M4 16GB** – always-on server, running on battery backup\n\n&#8203;\n\n    T-Echo (portable)\n        │ LoRa 433MHz, encrypted\n        ▼\n    T-Echo (USB) → Mac mini\n        │\n        ├── SAY: prefix → HA TTS → Voice PE speaker\n        ├── AI: prefix  → phi4-mini → gemma3:12b (always local)\n        ├── status      → Home Assistant sensors\n        ├── Online?     → forward to Discord (cloud AI)\n        └── Offline?    → route everything to local Ollama models\n    \n    Outbox: AI drops .msg files → listener sends over LoRa\n            (power outage alerts, reminders, etc.)\n\n# What's next\n\nI'm thinking about where this goes:\n\n* **Mesh AI network** – Meshtastic is a mesh protocol, every radio relays. Multiple nodes running local LLMs could create a neighborhood-scale AI network with zero internet\n* **Bigger local models** – looking at upgrading hardware for 30B+ parameter models\n* **Dead man's switch** — auto-alert if I don't check in within a time window\n\nWhat do you think?

But they can't read it because the channel is encrypted with a pre-shared key (PSK). It's like WiFi — everyone can see the network, but without the password you can't read the traffic. In Meshtastic you set up a channel name + a 256-bit encryption key, and only radios that have the same key can decrypt messages. I generated a new key and loaded it onto both my radios. Anyone listening just sees encrypted garbage. It's not military-grade or anything, but for a home setup it's more than enough.",

IIRC it was hated at launch because:\n\n1. it had broken chat templates (or possibly other bugs, it's been a while) on release. People assumed the accuracy/usability issues were caused by the censorship/safety OpenAI bolted on at the last minute, so they lashed out at being given a gimped model. This didn't get fixed for a couple of weeks, at least in GGUF world.\n2. Some people were expecting it to do NSFW chat like ChatGPT and whined when they found it doesn't. This is hardly representative of the sub, less than 1% of the threads/comments on this sub are about this stuff.\n\nThe only criticism you can still give it now is that the model wastes tokens and possibly intelligence on the censorship policy reasoning, which would be understandably annoying if you have slow hardware. idk if pew's heretic models remove this reasoning, if so it would be a huge speed boost and make the model even better.",

It's not about raw intelligence — even frontier models struggle with long task chains without good scaffolding.Two things that help in my experience: (1) aggressive state summarization between steps so the model isn't trying to hold the full history in context, and (2) structured memory files the agent reads/writes to instead of relying on conversational context. Basically, give it external memory so it doesn't have to remember everything itself.The privacy angle is underrated too. Running agents locally means your file system, browser history, and app data never leave your machine. For anyone handling sensitive work, that's not a nice-to-have — it's a requirement.",

But if you want access to every model under the sun without having to manage dozens or hundreds of accounts with different providers, OpenRouter makes sense. I can't be fucked to have my credit card on file with god knows how many API providers, all with their varying terms and conditions and whatnot, and trying to track the billing on that. Openrouter puts it all in one place. I can load up ten bucks and try out basically any model from any provider, under one convenient billing dashboard. \n\nErgo, it strikes me that the sort of people who use OR are the more savvy type, who are aware of how this shit works, and they're the ones that seem to be preferring the open models (due to whatever reason - speed, price, whatever). \n\nIMO, going to the providers directly only makes sense if you're totally sold on that provider, or have infinite patience to manage paying many providors and tracking the usage independently, and keeping up with their costs, and juggling dozens of separate API keys.

But for open weight models I would go either deepinfra (cheap but good setup -> tool calls) or fireworks ai (more expensive but really fast). Random routing destroys taking advantage of cache pricing and also there are a lot of providers that use bad setups or in my opinion weird quants that can make tool calls a nightmare.",
