Memory bandwidth is the actual bottleneck for CPU inference, not compute, and going from single to dual-channel literally doubles your throughput ceiling. People overlook this constantly and blame the CPU when their 32GB single stick setup crawls. The MoE architecture choice is smart too since you're only hitting 2.4B active parameters per token, which keeps the working set small enough to stay in cache on that i3. The Chinese token drift on the iGPU is interesting, I wonder if that's a precision issue with OpenVINO's INT8/FP16 path on UHD 620 since those older iGPUs have limited compute precision.

That would let the open-source community build better-aligned models without needing Anthropic's scale.\n\n\n\nEither way, Anthropic engaging with HuggingFace at all is a signal worth watching.

It involves taking a large, complex model (called the teacher model) and transferring its knowledge into a smaller, more efficient model (called the student model).The distilled model is trained to mimic the predictions of the larger model while maintaining much of its accuracy. The main benefits of distilled models are that they: 1. Require fewer resources: They are smaller and faster, making them more efficient for deployment on devices with limited computational power. 2. Preserve performance: Despite being smaller, distilled models often perform nearly as well as their larger counterparts. 3. Enable scalability: They are better suited for real-world applications that need to handle high traffic or run on edge devices.",

Nothing super quantifiable but vibe:\n\n* Faster - to be expected I guess given only Max has access\n* Longer running thinking & more interleaved thinking and doing\n* It really likes making lists. Same for presenting things visually in block diagrams and lists. Opencode doesn't seem to always read the tables as tables right though so there must be some formatting issue there\n* More thinking style backtracking thought patterns (\"Actually, wait - I need to be careful\")\n* Seems to remember things from much earlier better. e.g. tried something, it failed. Then added some features and at end it decided on its own to retry the earlier thing again having realised the features are relevant to failure case\n\nKeen to see how it does on rust. Was pretty happy with 4.7 already in general but on rust specifically sometimes it dug itself into a hole\n\nOverall definitely a solid improvement :)",

Here's one of the [earlier versions](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1poybe9/llama_32_3b_mri_build_progress/). There were a bunch more investigative posts where the author used the extended tool to find and visualize patterns, like nodes being responsible for certain things, or being more sensitive to quantization. Unfortunately the account was deleted recently, making it difficult to find all the latest posts on that.\n\nSo, visualizing static properties clearly has its benefits, and another take at the dynamic visualization could also yield nice results.",

I'm still not clear on what our policy is on posters 'abusing' LLMs to write just total non-sense self-promo posts [like this one from other day.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qz6zi3/i_built_a_fully_local_opensource_ai_workspace/o4am45l/?context=10000) -- I think that should clearly fall under the low-effort rules and the ton of posts like this one. Dude couldn't even get Claude to speak straight about what he's 'created', I didn't waste time going through source code but lord knows what dangers lurk in there.\n\n[I don't think this amazing malware vibe dev](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qfpfoy/orchestra_multimodel_ai_orchestration_system_with/o07em3u/) ever got followed up on after I sent in a mod mail about them. They blocked me, screamed at me that it wasn't a security issue, then their LLM fixed it and noted it was an extreme security issue, got uppity that I had ruined their post, so then they deleted the post and reposted it same day. Just clicking on that guys profile is a wild ride, and I guess he'll be back again with his next vibe coded vulnerability to peddle.\n\nThe current quality bar is so, so low, I know the ultra-spammy and psychotic project posts are getting cleaned up, but even the ones that remain are, wow. I think posts related to projects need to have like, 10x times more stringent rules. The first one being if the entire body of your post is LLM generated, its deleted. It just doesn't make any sense, if LLMs let you code it 100x faster then why don't they have 5 minutes to write a post about it? It's counter intuitive on an 'AI sub' to ban for AI use, but users don't come here to interact with LLM bots and people who act like LLM bots.",

Here's what you can unleash:\n\nRECOMMENDED MODELS:\n- Llama-2-13B (Best balance of performance and VRAM usage)\n- Mistral 7B (Good balance of speed and capability)\n- CodeLlama 7B: Great for coding tasks\n\nSAMPLING SETTINGS TO PLAY WITH:\n- Temperature: 0.7-0.8 for creative content, 0.1-0.2 for factual responses\n- Top_p: 0.9 provides optimal balance for most applications\n- Top_k: 40-50 maintains creativity while preserving coherence\n- Repetition penalty: 1.1-1.2  promotes response diversity\n\nWith that 3090, you can easily run 7B models at full precision and still have VRAM to spare, or go ham with 13B models using 4-bit quantization. The world's your oyster with this beast! 🚀\n\nJust keep that cooling on point - these models love to make your GPU sweat! 💪",

This gives sub-quadratic complexity for most layers while retaining full attention's expressiveness periodically.\n\nOther notable details:\n- **Partial RoPE** — only 25% of the 256-dim head gets rotary embeddings\n- **M-RoPE** (3D position encoding: temporal, height, width) for multimodal inputs\n- **Vision encoder** inherited from Qwen3-VL (27-layer ViT, patch size 16, spatial merge 2×2)\n- The models build on the already-merged **Qwen3-Next** architecture (PR #40771), with Qwen3.5 refactoring the projection structure in the DeltaNet module (separate `in_proj_qkv`, `in_proj_z`, `in_proj_\n\nMore detail: https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/93b0a136-fe1c-4077-892b-291bb90026f2",

If you train a very small model for a specific task, it will blow away any larger model you can put in there.

I ask them how many models they train a year and they tell me under 10 models a year. I just laugh because it cost me 3 to 5 dollars per trained model on runpod. \n\nThink about it, 10 models at 3 to 5 bucks per model is like 40 to 50 bucks a year. 10 years at max is 500 bucks. In 10 years.  5090 costs 4000 or more. \n\nMoral of the story is, you can rent a a crazy expensive GPU for a few dollars in order to train a small model that will give you really good output on CPU for pennies on the dollar and it will outperform much larger models.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e9q4ky8f76ig1.png?width=1665&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2d0a7c77615a21abdc04efc768da684e014a192\n\nRTX PRO 6000 with 96GB vram, 16 cores and 188GB of RAM for 1.89 an hour..\n\nI am not promoting runpod, I am just showing you that to train a model, you do not need to spend crazy money. It will cost you a few dollars, that it. \n\nAfter you train it and optimize it, you can run it on CPU and get fast response and really good token generation as it is a small optimized model and will outperform any model out there as it has been trained for that specific task. \n\nGood luck people.",

                  "text": "I’ll try to explain in more detail, but first off - I don't actually know the specific requirements for open-notebook. It’s unclear if it uses a built-in RAG for notes or which specific models it relies on for things like podcast generation, so I can't give you a definitive recommendation on which hardware to buy for that specific use case.\n\nAs for my local LLM setup: I use an M910q mini-PC as my home server (i5-6500T, 24GB RAM). I got it for somewhere between €50 and €90, I can’t quite remember. It runs Immich and several other services via Docker Compose, including a stack consisting of:\n\n* llama-swap + llama.cpp: To launch models on demand.\n* Open WebUI: For direct interaction with the LLMs.\n* Caddy: (I switched from Nginx recently because Caddy makes health checks much easier).\n* Various other services: For web searching, data parsing, etc.\n\nWhere the 3060 comes in:\n\nThat GPU is in my main, more powerful PC. Since my services don't talk to the models directly but instead use an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, I can proxy that endpoint to either the llama-swap instance on the mini-PC or the one on the 'big' rig with the 3060 12GB.\n\nTo handle this, my Caddyfile looks something like this (simplified for clarity):\n\n    :8080 {\n        reverse_proxy {\n            to http://192.168.0.11:8080   # My GPU PC\n            to http://llama-swap:8080      # Local CPU\n            \n            lb_policy first                # Requests go to the first available server\n    \n            health_path     /v1/models\n            health_interval 10s\n            health_timeout  5s\n            health_status   2xx\n            flush_interval -1\n        }\n    }\n\nOn my desktop with 3060 12Gb, I have a separate directory with llama-swap, llama.cpp, and the same models I have on the M910q, plus some beefier ones that only a GPU can handle.\n\nThanks to the health check settings, Caddy pings both instances. As soon as I fire up llama-swap on my main PC, Caddy automatically starts routing traffic there. Open WebUI and other services don’t even know the backend has switched, they just see new models appearing in the list. They talk to the Caddy container, and whatever happens behind the scenes is invisible to them.\n\nRegarding Tailscale: I don’t use it personally because it relies on a coordination server I don’t control. Instead, I use a somewhat chaotic mix of rathole, Nginx, and Caddy (some on a VPS) to expose my endpoints, even to my phone. But Tailscale is a solid choice if you prefer it. You could easily run open-notebook in the same stack and access it from anywhere.\n\nRegarding hardware advice: it’s tough to recommend a specific device in the $300-$500 range because prices vary by region, and I’m not sure which models you’ll need. My M910q runs HY-MT1.5 7B Q4 for translations (slowly, but it works - for example, this message is translated by this), various Gemma 3 versions for OCR and simple scripting, and other models for deep research tasks. If I need to edit something complex, I switch to the GPU-heavy models.\n\nI think you should first figure out exactly what you need to run open-notebook and check the requirements for the models you plan to use. Once you have those specs, it’ll be much easier to decide on the hardware.",

Windows 10 is bloatware. \n\n2) install koboldCPP / Kobold lite - there are videos on how to do this or ask Kimi AI or similar AI chatbot\n\n3) download Qwen2.5 1.5B gguf and TinyLlama 1.1B gguf and see which one works best for you.

The reward function always rewarded hallucinations. \n\nIt’s like a teenager taking a standardized test guessing filling in a random multiple choice answer, rather than leaving it blank. Does that make the teenager hallucinating? Not really, it just statistically is in the favor of the test taker if they have any information above random choice: they’re incentivized to guess at an answer. \n\nThe solution is simple, to set the reward function to favor epistemological uncertainty, and punish confident errors harshly. \n\nOpenAI basically grades answers no longer like a multiple choice test, but rather gives partial credit to correct levels of uncertainty.",

The API calls didn't work (due to some complex front-end and back-end field and type mappings, although these were already included in the API comments). It took about 30 communications to barely get it implemented (no time to deal with the UI). I feel like it's even weaker than Sonnet 4.5... I'm not sure if it's an issue with using it through Claude Code. Also, I bought the coding plan, but there are still occasional interruptions, and I have to take over and type \"continue\". Overall, the experience is still quite far from ideal. The price is barely reasonable, but the insufficient computing power and programming ability still haven't met my passing requirements. Keep up the good work, put a lot of pressure on Anthropic and OpenAI.",

Strawberry seems to perform far better than that.\n\n> if it performs vastly different/worse it's usually a sign of a bug\n\nyes strawberry was performing weirdly in training. Retention was not working well with SPDA. The problem was that the generated weights were too noisy for SPDA. AFT managed to handle that however SPDA couldn't. That's why I added post normalization in both `produce` and `forward` functions in Retention. That fixed the bug completely.\n\n> As for data sets, any reason why you're not using any of the hundreds available on huggingface?

I was just bored. Had nothing to do so I decided to waste my time by manually scrapping datasets. lol! Also the reason why I didn't use TinyStories cuz it's just too simple.\n\n> You seem to prepend the sink token at every single step. Is that intentional?

Think like this. input `<|sink|>Test prompt` -> model predicts `ing` which makes it `Test prompting`. Notice how I dropped `<|sink|>` in the final results. That's what's happening. I'll implement it at an architecture level similar to GPT-OSS",

It's actually only recently gotten popular, but he wrote the guide slowly (I helped with a few things) and put it all online over the course of a few years. For years afterwards not a whole lot of people played it, but all these Chinese bots were still indexing his site. \n\nNow that GLM, Qwen, and others have came out, I'll ask these offline-only models questions about the game and it's crazy how often they actually SOUND LIKE HIM when they talk about the different NPCs and strategies for playing the game. And don't get me wrong, they still hallucinate a lot, but they clearly talk about stuff he does on his website/guide. No where else in the world is this info, so I know they got it from him.",

The previous error bars were capturing the data distribution (assuming normal) - this is a wrong assumption given the fact that data are capped at 24 (so the distribution is not symmetric). The average round as main metric is still sub-optimal. There is an issue open on coder/balatrollm where I plan to update how the average round is computed.\n\nThanks for point it out :)",

It just needs to relay the results back to the LLM through a simple combat log, like:\n“Enemy received 0 damage because it is immune to that damage type.”\nLLMs can understand concepts like that just fine.\n\nYou also don’t need long-term memory of every fight.

For instance, when I face life-related problems take might take me hours or days to figure out, a short session with an LLM can significantly quicken that process.\n\nSince the original Llama was leaked, I've been using LLMs locally, but they I always felt they were lacking behind OpenAI or Google models. Thus, I would always go back to using ChatGPT or Gemini when I need serious output. If I needed a long chatting session or help with long documents, I didn't have choice to use the SOTA models, and that means willingly leaking personal or work-related data.\n\nFor me, Gemini-3 is the best model I've ever tried. I don't know about you, but I struggle sometimes to follow chatGPT's logic, but I find it easy to follow Gemini's. It's like that best friend who just gets you and speaks in your language.\n\nWell, that was the case until I tried Qwen3-Coder-Next. For the first time, I could have stimulating and enlightening conversations with a local model. Previously, I used not-so-seriously Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking as local daily driver, but that model always felt a bit inconsistent; sometimes, I get good output, and sometimes I get dumb one.\n\nHowever, Qwen3-Coder-Next is more consistent, and you can feel that it's a pragmatic model trained to be a problem-solver rather than being a sycophant. Unprompted, it will suggest an author, a book, or a theory that already exists that might help. I genuinely feel I am conversing with a fellow thinker rather than a echo chamber constantly paraphrasing my prompts in a more polish way. It's the closest model to Gemini-2.5/3 that I can run locally in terms of quality of experience.\n\n**For non-coders, my point is do not sleep on Qwen3-Coder-Next simply because it's has the \"coder\" tag attached.**\n\nI can't wait for for Qwen-3.5 models. If Qwen3-Coder-Next is an early preview, we are in a real treat.",

So on recommendation by a friend i tried Claude opus 4.5 which was the newest model they had. this was Jan of this year and it solved my problem in less than an hour. Since then the 4.6 model has been a massive jump in productivity and even having a pointless conversation with it seems unbelievable. No ego stroking no people pleasing. just logical and tempered responses. the only downside to it is the speed at which you can chew through your allowance of usage. so im pretty keen to see what this model does.  \n\nWhat model are you running and whats your hardware setup like?

Now we got 700B+ open models competing with the best closed ones.\n\nThe distillation pipeline has gotten insanely good too. Every time a new massive teacher model drops, the 30-70B range gets a noticeable bump within weeks. Ive been using Qwen derivatives for production workloads and the quality jump from distilled models is real.\n\nPlus lets be honest, for 95% of actual use cases a well tuned 30B model handles it just fine.

Then after you do a couple of quick and dirty projects in it, take your prompts, and use that to generate a set of new prompts in the same domain or of the same task type. \n\nOnce you have your promptset then you load the model with REAP (code is on cerebras github) on a GPU provider if you don't the hardware yourself. Let REAP run through YOUR custom promptset instead of the default (but do compare your promptset to the default to get an idea of a baseline).\n\nThen REAP will prune whatever parameters are less likely to be important to your application for this model and you can begin your quantization. I personally really like all of u/noctrex 's quants and if you look around you can figure out most or all of how to do those.\n\nRemember though, your promptset is how REAP calibrates what to chop off so check that default promptset and make sure your custom one has as much coverage as possible for your use case.

Deepseek/kimi were already large.  \nAnd for GLM its not that big of a loss because they release smaller versions of their model for the local users.  \nSo I personally rather have the really top models try to compete with closed source models so that the open scene is competitive, thats a win for everyone but especially users who don't want to be tied down to API providers.  \nAnd then for the local home user they should keep releasing stuff we can fit which GLM has repeatedly done.  \nDeepseek and Kimi should also begin doing this, it would make that playing field more interesting.\n\nBut we also still have Qwen, Gemini and Mistral as possible players who tend to release at more local friendly sizes.",

                  "text": "So, I was actually curious about that. I'm far from an expert in local llm. I wasn't necessary thinking of using as an agent model (tho, maybe, why not!) so I was thinking the cache quant would not be as big of a deal.\n\nThat said, I did task Claude to do some tests (open claude in tmux, give it access to my llama server in a tmux pane and ask it to iterate config to measure speed and quality) for me overnight to determine if the q4 cache had an effect and the consensus was that it didn't have a noticeable impact and the vram save enabled me. However, I didn't push informatin retrieval on a giant context and that might be the part where the q4 is problematic.\n\nSummary:\n**q4_0 KV cache has zero measurable quality impact on this model.** Across 16 tests (math, code, knowledge, needle-in-a-haystack, instruction following, long-form coherence), both configs produced **identical or near-identical outputs** with matching correctness. This is expected given the architecture: only 6 out of 52 layers use KV cache.\n\n> q4_0 KV cache quantization only affects the 6 attention layers. The other 46 layers (88.5% of the model) are completely unaffected. This is fundamentally different from a pure transformer where q4_0 would affect every single layer.\n\n\nNow, is that actually true, I'll be honest, I do not know.\n\n| Metric | q4_0 KV | f16 KV (default) |\n|--------|---------|-------------------|\n| **Generation speed** | ~59.5 t/s | ~59.5 t/s |\n| **Prompt processing** | ~100-130 t/s | ~100-130 t/s |\n| **VRAM usage** | 9.0 GB | 10.1 GB |\n| **VRAM saved** | **1.1 GB** | baseline |\n\n\nI'd be curious if those results actually make sense: https://github.com/jo-nike/experiments/blob/main/nemotron-kv-cache-quality-report.md\n\nI did launch a new series of test to get a better view on the \"needle in a haystack\" test that will probe bigger context window for information retrieval.\n\nOnce those tests are done, I'll get you a t/s for the config you asked and get back to you",

It delivers identical needle-retrieval accuracy to f16 while saving 1.1 GB of VRAM and providing faster prompt processing. The 6-attention-layer hybrid architecture makes this model exceptionally tolerant of aggressive KV quantization.\n\n---\n\nNow for your question, q8 for k/v cache, i was pushing it to it's max here:\n\n > - 128k: 90.9 t/s, ncmoe=12\n > - 256k: 87.7 t/s, ncmoe=15\n > - 1mil: 62.7t/s, ncmoe=30 (but that crashed on bigger context)\n\nMade me review my q4 config which gave me:\n\n > - 128k: 97.0 t/s, nccmoe=9\n > - 256k: 89.1 t/s, ncmoe=11\n > - 1mil: 64.9 t/s, ncmoe=30\n\nHere's the report if you're interested, it goes in quite bigger details such as t/s over context size: https://github.com/jo-nike/experiments/blob/main/nemotron-q8-kv-cache-results.md\n\n**Bottom line**: \n\nWith my setup, at 256k content, I'm probably better use Q8. At 128k content, I'm probably better with Q4. The difference between them is marginal.\n\n---\n\n**Testing Notes**: \n\n- That methodology of using Claude via claude code as an assistant to iterate over settings, test speed and quality and document the experimentation, was really great and a giant time saver. Claude basically created itself a script, run it, monitor it, take notes. \n\n- I was using sonnet 4.5 for this because I abused opus this week 🤦, but I would have used Opus otherwise, a local llm could definitely work too.\n\n- Flash attention requires transient vram that grows quite a bit with 500k+ context. Caused oom, had to readjust to give more headroom to flash attention by offloading more to cpu. **Don't overly pack your vram if you intend on actually using the whole 1m context**, you'd risk oom as the context grow due to FA overhead need.\n\n- I could probably optimized the 1mil q4 config a little bit, i offloaded to give FA space and because it's so long to generate the big context, I got tired and didn't care to redo the test to squeeze every little drop of vram I could.\n\n- Generating a 950,000 tokens context takes something like 30 minutes with q8, might have been a bit fast with q4, I didn't time sadly.\n\n- t/s drop significantly once the context get filled. For example, Q4 gets to 19.1 t/s on a 1million context.\n\n- I got that Blackwell gpu recently, hadn't had much chances to play with mxfp4 before, definitely interesting!

      "text": "I've tried lots of \"small\" models < 60 GB in the past. GLM 4.5 Air, GLM 4.7 Flash, GPT OSS 20B and 120B, Magistral, Devstral, Apriel Thinker, previous Qwen coders, Seed OSS, QwQ, DeepCoder, DeepSeekCoder, etc. So what's different with Qwen3 Coder Next in OpenCode or in Roo Code with VSCodium?\n\n* **Speed**: The reasoning models would often yet not always produce rather good results. However, now and then they'd enter reasoning loops despite correct sampling settings, leading to no results at all in a large over-night run. Aside from that the sometimes extensive reasoning takes quite some time for the multiple steps that OpenCode or Roo would induce, slowing down interactive work *a lot*. Q3CN on the other hand is an instruct MoE model, doesn't have internal thinking loops and is relatively quick at generating tokens.\n* **Quality**: Other models occasionally botched the tool calls of the harness. This one seems to work reliably. Also I finally have the impression that this can handle a moderately complex codebase with a custom client & server, different programming languages, protobuf, and some quirks. It provided good answers to extreme multi-hop questions and made reliable full-stack changes. Well, almost. On Roo Code it was sometimes a bit lazy and needed a reminder to really go deep to achieve correct results. Other models often got lost.\n* **Context size**: Coding on larger projects needs context. Most models with standard attention eat all your VRAM for breakfast. With Q3CN having 100k+ context is easy. A few other models also supported that already, yet there were drawbacks in the first two mentioned points.\n\nI run the model this way:  \n`set GGML_CUDA_GRAPH_OPT=1`\n\n`llama-server -m Qwen3-Coder-Next-UD-Q4_K_XL.gguf -ngl 99 -fa on -c 120000 --n-cpu-moe 29 --temp 0 --cache-ram 0`\n\nThis works well with 24 GB VRAM and 64 GB system RAM when there's (almost) nothing else on the GPU. Yields about 180 TPS prompt processing and 30 TPS generation speed for me.\n\n* `temp 0`? Yes, works well for instruct for me, no higher-temp \"creativity\" needed. Prevents the *very occasional* issue that it outputs an unlikely (and incorrect) token when coding.\n* `cache-ram 0`? The cache was supposed to be fast (30 ms), but I saw 3 second query/update times after each request. So I didn't investigate further and disabled it, as it's only one long conversation history in a single slot anyway.\n* `GGML_CUDA_GRAPH_OPT`? Experimental option to get more TPS. Usually works, yet breaks processing with some models.\n\n**OpenCode vs. Roo Code**:\n\nBoth solved things with the model, yet with OpenCode I've seen slightly more correct answers and solutions. But: Roo asks *by default* about every single thing, even harmless things like running a syntax check via command line. This can be configured with an easy permission list to not stop the automated flow that often. OpenCode on the other hand just permits everything by default in code mode. One time it encountered an issue, uninstalled and reinstalled packages in an attempt of solving it, removed files and drove itself into a corner by breaking the dev environment. Too autonomous in trying to \"get things done\", which doesn't work well on bleeding edge stuff that's not in the training set. Permissions can of course also be configured, but the default is \"YOLO\".\n\nAside from that: Despite running with only a locally hosted model, and having disabled update checks and news downloads, OpenCode (Desktop version) tries to contact a whole lot of IPs on start-up.",

Having to offload another layer or two to system RAM didn't seem to hurt the eval performance nearly as much as that helped the processing.\n\nI'm using the IQ4\\_NL quant - tried the MXFP4 too, but IQ4\\_NL seemed slightly better.

Yet the usage was mostly dominated by inference time for me, and this drops it to 75% due to less offloaded layers. With batch 2048 it's still 83% and 2x more PP speed. Context compaction speed is notably impacted by inference time (generating 20k tokens), so I prefer having as much of the model as possible on the GPU, as my usage is rarely impacted by having to re-process lots of data.",

This has been fixed by now. So if you don't use the latest version of llama.cpp or haven't (re-)downloaded the [updated quants](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3-Coder-Next-GGUF) then that could explain the mixed quality you were seeing. I also tried the Q8 REAP vs a UD Q4, but the Q8 was making more mistakes, probably because the [REAP quants](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qvjonm/first_qwen3codernext_reap_is_out/) haven't been updated yet, or maybe it's due to REAP itself.\n\nFor \"difficult tasks\": I did not test the model on LeetCode challenges, implementing novel algorithms and things, but on normal dev work: Adding new features, debugging & fixing broken things in a poorly documented real-life project - no patent-pending compression algorithms and highly exotic stuff.\n\nThe latest Claude 4.6 or GPT-5.2 Codex performs of course *way better*. More direct approach towards the solution, sometimes better approaches that the Q3CN didn't find at all. Yet still, for \"just getting some dev work done\" it's no longer needed to have the latest and greatest. Q3CN is the first local model that's usable for me in this area. Of course you might argue that using the latest SOTA is always best, as you always want the fastest, best solution, no matter what, and I would agree.",

That avoids internal reasoning loops and keeps latency predictable, which really matters for agent-style tools and long runs.\n\nTool calling and structured outputs are noticeably more reliable, and the long context (100k+) is actually usable on 24 GB VRAM thanks to its attention/memory characteristics. Combined with deterministic sampling (temp 0), it behaves stably for real-world coding instead of drifting or stalling.",

I've had issues with some models hallucinating tool calls or breaking the JSON format mid-stream.\n\nAlso—curious about your OpenCode vs Roo Code comparison. The \"YOLO permissions\" thing in OpenCode is exactly why I've been hesitant. Did you end up configuring stricter permissions, or just stick with Roo for production work?\n\nAppreciate the detailed write-up on the llama-server flags too.

With that approach one can (pre)load the required experts to maximize generation speed without having to wait that much for the comparatively slow SSD. Maybe you did something similar?

It offloads the MoE expert layers to CPU while keeping attention on GPU, so you get decent 20+ tok/s generation without needing a 5090.\n\nWith 96GB DDR5 you should be golden.

Of course you could also rewire the Copilot that's forced into VSCode for local LLMs. OpenCode is less of an IDE, but more a vibe-coding tool.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nLast week I shared preliminary results on a new subquadratic attention mechanism ([https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qol3s5/preliminary\\_new\\_subquadratic\\_attention\\_20k\\_toks](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qol3s5/preliminary_new_subquadratic_attention_20k_toks)). Following up with the full release: model + inference code are now available.\n\n**TL;DR**: 30B model achieving O(L\\^(3/2)) scaling instead of O(L\\^2). Enables 1M–10M context on a single GPU with decode speeds that stay practical even at extreme context lengths. Ships with an OpenAI-compatible server and CLI to try out.\n\n\\- 🤗 **Model**: [https://huggingface.co/concavity-ai/superlinear-exp-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/concavity-ai/superlinear-exp-v0.1)\n\n\\- 💻 **Code**: [https://github.com/concavity-ai/superlinear](https://github.com/concavity-ai/superlinear) (\\`pip install superlinear\\`)\n\n\\- 📄 **Paper**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18401](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18401)\n\n\n\n**Main Idea**\n\nYou can think of attention as a search algorithm to find relevant information for next-token prediction. Standard attention is basically O(L) brute-force search. We're doing O(L\\^0.5) jump-search with learned routing: score O(L\\^0.5) candidate spans, select top-k, then do token-level attention within the selected spans.\n\nThis gives **O(L\\^(3/2)) total complexity** while preserving **random context access** — any token can be selected by content-dependent routing, unlike fixed sliding windows. When you 10x the context length, the search budget only grows by \\~3.2x. That subquadratic scaling really matters for long context.\n\n\n\n**Performance (Single B200 GPU)**\n\n    | Context Length | Prefill (tok/s) | Decode (tok/s) | Memory  |\n    |----------------|-----------------|----------------|---------|\n    | 1M tokens      | ~20,202         | ~109           | 66 GB   |\n    | 10M tokens     | ~5,576          | ~76            | ~120 GB |\n\nKey point: 1M → 10M context (10x increase) only drops decode speed by \\~30%, not the 10x slowdown with dense attention.\n\n\n\n**Why This Matters**\n\nWhen you have fast long-context inference, usage patterns change. The key is **maintaining the cache** instead of reprocessing everything:\n\n\\- ***Almost-infinite chat***: KV cache in memory for instant responses, save/restore sessions to disk for persistence\n\n\\- ***Document Q&A***: Load documents once, ask cross-document questions without reprocessing (our GitHub example: 8 Wikipedia articles with cross-document reasoning)\n\n\\- ***Long-form generation***: 20k+ token reasoning on difficult math problems and coherent long article writing, all with maintained context\n\nEarly results: perfect NIAH at 512K context (up from 256K last week), cross-document reasoning working, subquadratic scaling working in practice.\n\nSince no existing inference engine is going to support our custom kernels, we built the full stack ourselves: Triton kernels, OpenAI-compatible server, session snapshots, chunked prefill, CLI with BM25 RAG.\n\n\n\n**Limitations & Next Steps**\n\n***Current limitations:***\n\n\\- This is an \\*\\*architecture + systems feasibility release\\*\\*, not production-quality\n\n\\- Limited training data (initial SFT only)\n\n\\- Comprehensive evals beyond NIAH still needed\n\n\\- FP16 only (66GB for 1M context) — quantization coming soon\n\n***Quantization*** **(coming soon):**\n\n\\- 4-bit/8-bit quantization to run 1M context on 24GB consumer GPUs\n\n\\- Target: RTX 4090 / RTX 5090 with full 1M context\n\n\\- 2M context on 48GB cards (e.g., RTX 6000 Ada)\n\n***Hardware support:***\n\n\\- Currently CUDA only (B200, RTX 6000 Blackwell tested)\n\n\\- AMD ROCm port coming (Triton kernels should make this straightforward)\n\n\\- Eventually Apple Silicon (harder but not impossible)\n\n***Training & Quality improvements:***\n\n\\- Scaling up SFT data with more long-context examples\n\n\\- Potentially doing continued pretraining on long documents\n\n\\- Expanding perfect NIAH range beyond 512K\n\n\\- Real-world long-context benchmarks (book QA, codebase analysis, multi-document reasoning)\n\n***New end-user applications***: We are planning to develop local-first end-user applications based on this. What would you actually use long context for? Would love to hear specific use cases to help us prioritize.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\nTrying something new is extremely hard. Everyone likes existing transformer architectures — optimizations at every level, predictable scaling laws. But to make truly long-context models practical on local hardware, I think we need new ideas. It doesn't hurt to try, right?\n\nI'm trying not to spam this sub, so the GitHub repo is the best place to follow progress. Happy to answer questions here though! If you try it and hit issues, open a GitHub issue. And if you have thoughts on long-context use cases, I'd love to hear them.\n\nThanks for all the encouragement on the last post!\n\n**Links**:\n\n\\- 🤗 **Model**: [https://huggingface.co/concavity-ai/superlinear-exp-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/concavity-ai/superlinear-exp-v0.1)\n\n\\- 💻 **Code**: [https://github.com/concavity-ai/superlinear](https://github.com/concavity-ai/superlinear)\n\n\\- 📄 **Paper**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18401](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18401)",

It could also \"zoom in\" and decide to fetch more detail to load into context (similar to your random access idea), via learned attention thresholds instead of search scores. \nKey difference is also that your idea needs end-to-end training, while mine was a model-agnostic wrapper approach because I couldn't afford to retrain an entire model.) \n\nOverall really great read, a lot to learn from!\nI may or may not eventually publish my work if it holds any value for the community.

Yeah for standard attention, it is just so optimized (hardware + software + capital) that pretty much any other method will lose on either on speed or quality, if not both.

Is this method feasible? \n\nI agree with you on the lack of benchmarks here. I treat this as a feasibility study. A fair comparison on benchmarks will require comparable training as full attention models, which requires astronomical resources. I am taking a more qualitative path here rather than quantitive - at least on my offline tests, it performs comparable to standard attention on short context, and it is able to maintain reasoning chains up to tens of thousands of tokens.

But for harder math problems, the model is able to generate coherent reasoning chains over 30k tokens to come up with the right answer, so I am not too worried about the basic LLM performance, but yeah, I do need to find the time to show these benchmarks, because it seems like people do care about these numbers.\n\nI actually spent most of my time on the harder problem of extending the context capability of the model. I was able to push the perfect NIAH context from 256k last week to 512k this week, and my goal is to get to 1M before running other tests, but since I am doing long context training, it should be able to generalize to other similar tests.\n\nAnd yeah, routing is definitely the biggest problem, because after selecting the spans it is just standard attention. The router is actually very complicated and since it doesn't come up with the base model, we will have train it with a lot of data. Maybe there is a better way to train it, like the lightening indexer in DeepSeek v3.2, or other block based architectures. ",
