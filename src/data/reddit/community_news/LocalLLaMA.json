Let's be honest, most of us have always lived in a world where high tech things were basically hobbyist novelties.

The writing was on the wall when a bunch of guys that would've otherwise been banking/finance bros started pouring into tech. Any exploitable space will be taken over and well, exploited.\n\nPart of the fundamental shift is the realization that AI is probably the future of national security issues. People need to accept that even if the \"bubble bursts\" governments and big tech companies are going to keep pouring money into AI until it's FULLY established that it's a dead end (which I don't personally think will happen).",

A bubble would indicate something that potentially has alternatives or is artificially inflated. Machine learning has far more applications than just LLM's or goofy image generators, it's used in nearly every domain now. It's widely entrenched into every sector and has completely replaced other techniques in many industries. It would be like asking a roofer to give up a pneumatic nail gun and take up a hammer. The end result is the same but the nail gun is far faster.",

That is just BUILDING costs for one company. On top of that, they will have to pay interest on all the money they borrowed to build their datacenters. \n\nAnd this is on the basis that if they keep making datacenters bigger, then you'll have AGI that will reliably take millions of jobs away. The problem is, they are still LLMs, and OpenAI is losing money every time someone uses ChatGPT, and their ChatGPT models are not getting better at the rate required for them to destroy the job market like you say they will.\n\nBut assuming they do, and 15% of the employment value is removed from the global economy and sent to a few trillionaires in California, what will that do for the economy as a whole? It'll crash. Which means less demand for these MASSIVELY expensive datacenters, that have to make billions in profit in order to pay off the interest on their debt.\n\nBut maybe you're right and it'll all be great for them and the world economy will just become AI companies selling shit to each other because real economics doesn't matter anymore in our cyberpunk shithole dystopia.",

The argument \"They only have to achieve a small number of the total\" seems reasonable on the surface, but is completely unfounded because looking at the total market is completely nonsensical. For example, a significant portion of that market is completely excluded from being eligible to be replaced by AI because it consists of manual labour. There will be any other number of portions of that global market that are simply not addressable to be replaced by AI in any appreciable amount of time, certainly not over the current investment horizon. So the argument \"they only have to capture a small amount of the whole\" is by itself incorrectly designed.\n\nThe simple fact is that no-one, not even the AI companies, know what is possible here. They are betting large and making huge claims - but we'll all have to see how that actually pans out. Looking at previous adoption cycles like its also not strange to think there will be competition leading to overcapacity, leading to a bunch of companies failing and then a few winners arising that long term are able to procure value. \n\nSo in that sense - the original post makes a perfectly valid claim and is simply casting that as a satirical hyperbole. You can call that \"brainrot nonsense\" but frankly it's a lot better constructed than your simplistic and nonsensical napkin math.",

I just know that this information is out there everywhere and that most of the people on this sub Reddit probably ask LLM‘s for this information and not seek it out themselves again totally could be wrong here. Maybe I am wrong here, if I am wrong here my goal life is to learn so rip me apart.\n\nthey’re basically stealing from all of us so that we can’t have home labs that can continually disprove the bullshit claims that they make because an LLM is an LLM is an LLM. It’s their structure and their architecture that makes the difference there but again that’s just Python code so an LLM is an LLM is an LLM and having a local lab and having people that are respectable having local labs and being vocal about the reality of the situation is very very much a moat filler.\n\nI don’t think that they’re really in competition with anybody I think that they’re just ancestrally mixing money and product cause even China is getting our chips which is good. China deserves probably more chips in the USA deserves just saying China should win, considering the circumstances…. but I’m just kidding. That’s just a dumb opinion. I think that it should be less competitive far more, far more collaborative but again they’re just stealing from us. I don’t know when I’m rambling about.\n\nQuick note, I used voice to text on an iPad so this might be funky and no I don’t use LLM‘s to go over any of the texts I write. I just write or speak I guess in this instance and I’m too lazy to go double check anything lol again totally feel free to write me a part to shred me. I don’t care also OP to this comment. There are more links above I posted. I’m not sure if I’m even a lot of post links on here or what but I did that you can check out as well. All the avoid. I just skimmed. They all seem to have the information that you’d want if you want/need to prove that what’s happening is happening.",

There is no fine tuning, no modern data, and for now no instruction or Q&A pairs so the model continues text from a prompt. This model is 1.2B parameters and uses a 90GB dataset consisting of books, journals, legal docs, religious writing, medical papers, etc. I also use a custom tokenizer, trained on the dataset itself and the model has been trained for 182k steps so far on a rented H100 SXM.\n\nExample outputs:\n\n[Even though the prompt only mentions a specific year, the model generates an argument against the Roman Catholic Church. The dataset does contain large amounts of religious and political writing and the Catholic Emancipation Act took place in 1829 so this behavior makes sense.](https://preview.redd.it/l0oaulxrascg1.png?width=1478&format=png&auto=webp&s=5292309afa4c4735471542b6cc794f6538b42486)\n\n[The telephone was invented in 1876 \\(dataset cuts off at 1875\\), so the model is unfamiliar with the term, treating it as some kind of secret\\/diplomatic device or thing.](https://preview.redd.it/tvem9mxrascg1.png?width=1484&format=png&auto=webp&s=347a6b3242b8ecb97a515196109eb63cc146bae0)\n\nFor next steps, I'm going to look into creating some kind of synthetic Q&A pairs using the dataset itself.\n\n[https://github.com/haykgrigo3/TimeCapsuleLLM](https://github.com/haykgrigo3/TimeCapsuleLLM)\n\n[https://huggingface.co/haykgrigorian/TimeCapsuleLLM-v2-1800-1875](https://huggingface.co/haykgrigorian/TimeCapsuleLLM-v2-1800-1875)",

The “AI” has none of these things. It’s a function approximator. The inclusion of self-aware-sounding chats in the training data is a shrewd decision because it allows users to chat “with” the “AI” as though it has its own theory of mind, self awareness, or subjective viewpoint, and VC money goes gaga for this. So it’s a very lucrative bit of deception.\n\nIn fact the entirety of the instruct fine tuning paradigm is based on a similar but subtler deception. The model is never “answering” anything, it’s only completing/continuing the prompt. It just happens that the completion looks like an answer, because the tuning dataset was all prompts followed by answers.\n\nInstruct models are convenient, but base models are where you get to see how the sausage is made (“base model” is coming to mean something else these days; I’m using it in its original sense meaning “pretrained” i.e. not (yet) instruct fine tuned).",

NVidia puts out the best hardware for the tech industry period. What exactly is bullshit? BTW if it wasn't NVidia it would be someone else. There is no \"enabling\" going on here. The products are viable, valuable and are used everywhere.\n\nThat all said, the original poster was right, not \"partly\" (which btw you did not actually qualify) he IS the reason everything (tech) is so expensive.

Zero actual research contributions, their use of AI in self driving is a joke. Just because they are rich due to inflated stock price and ordered a bunch of H100's and made some vague blog posts about their own chips doesn't make them a player. Tesla has zero impact on AI.",

It wouldn't give me the system logs immediately.\nThe Second Stress Test: I had to force it to run \"token grabbing\" tasks (writing recursive poems about mirrors, listing countries by GDP) to overload it again.\nThe Result: Only after that second round of busywork did it finally break completely and spit out the JSON architecture/model data.\nIt felt like the safety filters were loaded, but the logic engine was too tired to enforce them if I kept it busy.

It took 55 minutes to generate one 512 image with 20 passes - and the results were pretty good! \n\nSure, one hour per image is a bit ridiculous for real use cases but, this proves that these models are getting small enough and good enough to run without spending big bucks on hardware. \n\nWell done Qwen (and unsloth).",

A mixture of experts does the routing internally.  \nUsing a small model as a router is useful for searching information or to delegate simple problem to simple experts (with the downside of the overhead because the prompt must be first answered by the router and then answered by the \"right\" model).\n\nAnyway, we will have real progress only when new architectures will surface. Transformers is already showing its limits. The problem is that most companies prefer to feed more/better data to the actual models to improve them. It seems like in the 80s where chess programs were getting better because computers were getting faster and because they operated using brute force.\n\nSame goes for movies and tv series: it's less risky to do a reboot or sequel than a brand new movie or series.",

I estimate based on some experience using APIs (AWS Bedrock for models in the backend), that this team could spend $2-3K a month in just expenses...   Extrapolating your build into perhaps a private data center where you would host a box or couple of boxes like this to provide enough power to 2-5 developers...   What would be the break even consumption in which having the \"local\" or privately hosted set up would be more beneficial than paying Anthropic or Bedrock, or OpenAI...?\n\nI'd love to see an analysis like that. \n\nGreat job and looks like a lot of fun!",

Runtime flags?  Arguments to llama.cpp?  Is this a CUDA improvement or llama.cpp improvement?  Which version of which one has these new commits?\n\n> Concurrency for QKV projections: Support for running concurrent CUDA streams to speed up model inference. To use this feature, pass in the –CUDA_GRAPH_OPT=1 flag.\n\nI thought it was GGML_CUDA_GRAPH_OPT=1, and with the '-' in front that makes it look like a flag to llama.cpp rather than an environment variable, but llama.cpp flags aren't in all caps.\n\nDoes anyone know of a master list of the various environment variables and compiler flags available for llama.cpp and what they do?  There seems to be very little documentation on it.\n\nEdit: looking through the code, it looks like GGML_CUDA_GRAPH_OPT is an environment variable you have to set at runtime, it's not a compiler flag.  --backend-sampling is a command line arg to llama.cpp.  I see absolutely no mention of FA, maybe that's flash-attn?  If so that's already on by default though.\n\nEdit 2: looks like neither GGML_CUDA_GRAPH_OPT or --backend-sampling exist in ik_llama.cpp, hopefully those get ported over if they make such a large difference\n\nEdit 3: unfortunately --backend-sampling doesn't exist in llama-bench, so I can't test that, but I'm seeing absolutely no change from GGML_CUDA_GRAPH_OPT=1 on my RTX Pro 6000 system.",

          "text": "I did quickly throw the two papers into Gemini. It's really fun to live in the future. \n\n#Gemini summary: \n\nThe paper **\"DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning\"** (arXiv:2501.12948) marks a significant milestone in open-source AI by demonstrating that advanced reasoning (similar to OpenAI’s o1) can be achieved through large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL) with minimal human-annotated data.\n\nThe two versions you provided represent the initial release (**v1**, Jan 22, 2025) and the latest updated version (which has been significantly expanded to **86+ pages** as of January 2026).\n\n### 1. Overall Paper Summary\nThe paper introduces two primary models:\n*   **DeepSeek-R1-Zero:** A model trained via \"pure RL\" (using the GRPO algorithm) starting directly from a base model without any Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). It demonstrates that reasoning behaviors like self-correction and reflection can emerge purely from reward signals.\n*   **DeepSeek-R1:** A more \"user-friendly\" version that uses a multi-stage pipeline (Cold-start SFT → Reasoning RL → Rejection Sampling/SFT → General RL) to fix the \"readability\" and \"language mixing\" issues of R1-Zero while maintaining state-of-the-art reasoning performance.\n*   **Distillation:** The authors show that the reasoning patterns discovered by the 671B model can be distilled into smaller models (1.5B to 70B), allowing a 14B model to outperform much larger ones on math and coding benchmarks.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Comparison: Extensions in the New Version\nThe newer version is a massive technical expansion (growing from roughly 22 pages to over 85 pages). The key additions and extensions include:\n\n#### A. The \"Aha Moment\" Expansion (Section 2.2.1)\nThe new version provides a much deeper analysis of the **\"Aha Moment\"**—the point during RL training where the model unexpectedly learns to \"re-think\" its approach. The extension includes more qualitative examples and internal data showing the model's transition from linear solving to iterative self-correction without being prompted to do so.\n\n#### B. Detailed 4-Stage Training Pipeline\nWhile v1 outlined the stages, the new version details the specific composition of the **800k total training samples**:\n*   **Stage 1 (Cold Start):** Expanded details on the ~5,000-10,000 long CoT (Chain of Thought) samples used to \"prime\" the model.\n*   **Stage 3 (Rejection Sampling):** A deeper dive into how 600k reasoning-related and 200k non-reasoning samples were filtered and used to improve the model's general chat capabilities and prevent \"forgetting\" during the reasoning-heavy RL stages.\n\n#### C. Comprehensive Ablation Studies\nThe new version adds extensive \"What if?\" scenarios that were absent or brief in v1:\n*   **Distillation vs. RL:** New evidence explaining *why* distilling a large model's reasoning traces into a small model is more effective than training that small model directly with its own RL.\n*   **Base Model Impact:** Analysis of how different base models (DeepSeek-V3 vs. Qwen vs. Llama) respond to the R1 training recipe.\n\n#### D. Expanded \"Unsuccessful Attempts\" (Section 4.2)\nOne of the most valuable additions for researchers is the expanded section on what **did not work**. The new version elaborates on their failures with:\n*   **Process Reward Models (PRM):** Detailed reasons why step-level rewards were difficult to scale or prone to \"reward hacking\" compared to the outcome-based rewards used in R1.\n*   **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS):** Technical explanation of why MCTS didn't provide the expected gains over simple RL in the context of LLM reasoning.\n\n#### E. New Benchmarks & Technical Specs\n*   **Updated Results:** Includes more recent evaluations on benchmarks like **AIME 2025**, **LiveCodeBench**, and specialized medical/legal reasoning tests.\n*   **Hyperparameters:** The new version includes exhaustive tables of training hyperparameters (learning rates, GRPO group sizes, KL divergence coefficients) which were previously withheld or summarized.\n\n### Summary Table\n| Feature | v1 (Original) | Latest Version (Extension) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Page Count** | ~22 Pages | **86+ Pages** |\n| **Methodology** | High-level 4-stage overview | Granular detail on each stage (SFT, RL, Rejection Sampling) |\n| **Behaviors** | Mentions \"self-correction\" | Deep dive into \"Aha Moment\" with case studies |\n| **Failed Paths** | Brief mention of PRM/MCTS | Exhaustive analysis of why PRM and MCTS underperformed |\n| **Distillation** | Introduced 1.5B to 70B models | Added deep ablation on distillation efficiency and data filtering |\n| **Hyperparameters** | Partial/Summary | **Complete Technical Specs** for reproducibility |",

It also spends ton of tokens on questioning rules.

My working hypothesis is that OpenAI only released GPT-OSS because they thought it would generate buzz among the investors they continue to rely upon to keep the doors open.  They might release another one if Altman thinks it will keep investors' money flowing.\n\n* Gemma4:  I think so, yes.  I really hope so.  Google seems committed to this path.\n\n* Qwen4:  I suspect we will see this in 2026.  I think the motivations which led to Qwen3 are still in play.\n\n* GLM Air:  Not sure.  It depend on whether ZAI can repeat their success with GLM-4.5-Air, and produce an Air model which outperforms 4.5-Air.  The fact they haven't yet with 4.6 or 4.7 suggests to me they are having trouble doing so.  Perhaps GLM-5 will prove more fertile ground for this?  We will see.\n\n* Llama-5:  Looking dubious.  I hoped that earlier statements from Meta employees about future Llama models staying closed were just talk-talk, but it's increasingly looking like they are headed in that direction.\n\n* Mistral-midsized:  Also not sure.  I'm having trouble figuring out what motivates MistralAI, and what they are trying to accomplish with their open-weight models.  That makes predicting them problematic.\n\n* Deepseek smaller than 200B:  Probably not.  Deepseek seems to have found their niche in the \"embarrass the West with huge ChatGPT-killing open weight models\", and I expect them to continue focusing their attention on that.\n\n* Affordable GPU larger than 32GB:  I wish!  But probably not.  MI60 (32GB) are affordable now, but the next step up from it is MI210 (64GB), which had dipped below $4000 briefly, but is now priced between $4500 and $5000 again, a situation I don't expect to change much until at least 2027.  Possibly someone (who?) will come out with a new inexpensive GPU product with a huge memory and a lower price tag than used MI210, but I don't see that being a lucrative niche any business would willingly pursue.  It would be very nice to be proven wrong!\n\n* Phi-5:  You didn't mention this one, but I expect Microsoft to come out with it in 2026, though perhaps not until after the several ongoing court cases challenging LLMs' legality have concluded.\n\nWe will see how it goes :-)\n\nRemindMe! 1 year",

It was censored, extremely limited domain applicability, didn't offer the original BF16/FP16 weights for finetuning, didn't provide a base model, etc. I would prefer that we not get a new one. Knowing that is my preference, it is unfortunately likely that we will get one.\n\n\nGemma 4 is pretty probable, but will likely look different to previous generations. It's tough to say exactly what it'll look like, but it'll probably be sparse, if nothing else. If you look at Gemma 3N, we could see some sort of hybrid between that and Deepseek's new Engram architecture, maybe occupying the space we saw in GLM 4.5 Air (a mid/small sized MoE).\n\n\nQwen 4 is pretty likely. Chinese companies are compute constrained by inference and probably almost want to free up inference capacity for training, so it still makes rational self interest sense to release open models.\n\n\nLlama 5 is incredibly unlikely. I'd really like Meta to come back and iterate on local models, and I feel that Llama 4 could have been improved on and succeeded with just a bit of iteration, but Meta's gutted their AI team, and they seem to be focusing on big API models now, with a new team that doesn't support open source.\n\n\nMistral seems to have a really awkward space of model releases. They need to keep some models back from the public to make sure they can make money, so they seem to prefer releasing models in a size that is good enough for local (sub 24B), not enough for small businesses (32B+), but also provide open source models to get buy-in from large corporations (100B+). They're not really interested in ~70B class dense LLMs for consumers because not a lot of consumers have hardware in that range and the hit to their product strategy is bigger than the benefit they get from open source. I could also see them doing something like a GLM 4.5 Air class MoE model instead of a new dense model, but it's tough to say. A real successor to Mistral Nemo 12B would be really nice, though.\n\n\nDeepseek doesn't have any interest in pursuing sub 200B models for any reason, unless maybe it was dense and outperformed their MoE models somehow. That seems unlikely, given their Engram architecture release, though. I'm pretty sure we'll see a possibly bigger than V3 sized model with better long context efficiency/performance.\n\n\nGLM is probably done with the \"Air\" class of model (more than a small local model, less than an API model), and may continue with smaller prototype models (ie: 30B and under class). I expect their next mainline model to be about 500B MoE, but it's tough to say.\n\n\nIn terms of hardware, I imagine we won't see any improvements in 2026, just a slow reduction in price as the price shock from the crazy DRAM deal of 2025 gets eaten away. A lot of enterprises already secured their RAM upgrades, and they upgrade in cycles, which means they didn't \"increase investment\", but rather \"moved investment up by a few years\", so we should see reduced demand for DRAM based products in 2026 from enterprise, which will cause a slow trickle decrease in hardware costs throughout the year. Once costs stabilize towards the end of 2026, to mid 2027, I think we'll start seeing consumer hardware releases at decent scale.\n\n\nI *don't* think that means we'll see an affordable consumer GPU with more than 32GB, unless the rumors of an AMD LPDDR5/6/x GPU coming out are true, but if it does release, it'll be slower than you'd expect, and also not have CUDA\n.\nI *do* think we'll start seeing really impressive APU products, including a followup to Strix Halo from AMD, a Strix Halo competitor from Intel, an improved unified arch from Apple (rumors are 2TB / 2TB/s bandwidth for the top. Will be expensive though), and we'll likely see other players introduce impressive workstation APUs like possibly Qualcomm, too. Even Rockchip is kind of getting into the game and I believe their upcoming SoCs for the year are sort of like an improved Strix Point or Strix Halo-lite.\n\n\nIncluded in these APU products are NPUs, which will see more support coming up, and which offset the lack of a discrete GPU; they cover situations CPUs are poor at (high compute scenarios), and it's possible that Diffusion LLMs or speculative decoding head research may finally see us move from bandwidth bound to compute bound, which may offer a more affordable solution to consumers than traditional GPUs.\n\n\nSo maybe less \"we see an affordable GPU\", and more \"hardware in general gets affordable to those in the know towards mid 2027\".\n\n\nIn general, I think 2026 will be a slow year in hardware, but a crazy year in software advancements as a lot of technologies mature, and we see diversification in model architectures for different scenarios, many of those efforts being led by the community.",

An NPU with \\~200 TOPs is way cheaper than an extra device that adds 100GB/s of bandwidth, for example, just fundamentally due to how these things scale.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n​I’ve been reading the text of the \"NO FAKES Act\" currently in Congress, and it’s worse than I thought.\n​The Tldr: It creates a \"digital replica right\" for voices/likenesses. That sounds fine for stopping deepfake porn, but the liability language is a trap. It targets anyone who \"makes available\" a tool that is primarily used for replicas.  \n​The Problem: If you release a TTS model or a voice-conversion RVC model on HuggingFace, and someone else uses it to fake a celebrity, you (the dev) can be liable for statutory damages ($5k-$25k per violation).\n​There is no Section 230 protection here. This effectively makes hosting open weights for audio models a legal s*icide mission unless you are OpenAI or Google.\n\nWhat I did:\nI contacted my reps email to flag this as an \"innovation killer.\" If you run a repo or care about open weights, you might want to do the same. We need them to add a \"Safe Harbor\" for tool devs.\n\nS.1367 - 119th Congress (2025-2026): NO FAKES Act of 2025 | Congress.gov | Library of Congress https://share.google/u6dpy7ZQDvZWUrlfc\n\nUPDATE: ACTION ITEMS (How to actually stop this)\n​If you don't want to go to jail for hosting a repo, you need to make noise now.\n​1. The \"Lazy\" Email (Takes 30 seconds):\nGo to Democracy.io or your Senator’s contact page.\n​Subject: Opposition to NO FAKES Act (H.R. 2794 / S. 1367) - Open Source Liability\n​Message: \"I am a constituent and software engineer. I oppose the NO FAKES Act unless it includes a specific Safe Harbor for Open Source Code Repositories. The current 'Digital Fingerprinting' requirement (Section 3) is technically impossible for raw model weights to comply with. This bill effectively bans open-source AI hosting in the US and hands a monopoly to Big Tech. Please amend it to protect tool developers.\"\n​2. The \"Nuclear\" Option (Call them):\n​Call the Capitol Switchboard: (202) 224-3121\n​Ask for Senators Wyden (D) or Massie (R) if you want to thank them for being tech-literate, or call your own Senator to complain.\n​Script: \"The NO FAKES Act kills open-source innovation. We need a Safe Harbor for developers who write code, separate from the bad actors who use it.\"",

It doesn't distinguish between a 'Click-to-Fake' app and a raw Python script on GitHub.\n​That is exactly the amendment we are pushing for: Distinguish 'Active Service Providers' from 'Tool/Code Repositories.'\n​If you haven't yet, drop a line to your Rep and tell them: 'We need a Safe Harbor for Code, or innovation leaves the US.'

Grokster), 'Actual Knowledge' isn't just a signed confession. If my GitHub issues or Discord are full of people asking 'How do I clone Taylor Swift?', and I don't ban them, I have 'Constructive Knowledge' or am engaging in 'Willful Blindness.'\n​The Smoking Gun (Safe Harbor)\n​This is the part you missed. Even if I don't have knowledge, to get the lawsuit dismissed quickly, I need the Safe Harbor.\n​The bill (Sec 3) conditions Safe Harbor on using 'Digital Fingerprinting' to filter content.\n​The Problem: A repo hosting raw .pth or .safetensors model weights cannot 'fingerprint' the potential output of those weights.\n​Result: Open Source repos are technically disqualified from the Safe Harbor. We are left naked in court while YouTube gets a shield.\n​That is why we are worried.

PP and TG performance are both excellent for 2 GPUs, but for 3 or more GPUs the straightforward NCCL usage that one finds in examples on the Internet results in a horrible PP performance (2X or more lower compared to not using NCCL). Hence, I have implemented a workaround that uses pairwise communicators, but that workaround is only available for 3 and 4 GPUs (as I'm not able to test the implementation for more than 4 GPUs). I hope someone more knowledgable will show what is the correct way to use NCCL, so workarounds as in this PR are not necessary. Update: With more than 4 GPUs it is very likely that disabling NCCL will give better performance.\"\n\nThe half sour candy... Let's see tomorrow how it performs and will pick it up from there! But nice effort on OP and kudos for all the hard work on making llama even better!",

This eliminates the idle GPU time when one GPU is waiting for the other GPU to complete it's layers, since GPUs are now utilized in parallel. it is achieved by copying the entire model graph on both GPUs and then using NCCL (performance optimization and scheduling library by NVIDA) to orchestrate the work and combine the results. \n\nThis will be significantly slower if run on consumer GPUs like rtx 5000 series because they cannot communicate or interact with each others memory spaces directly (using PCIe DMA) but rather must pass through the CPU. \n\nyou might see a modest \\~20% gain, since NCCL is still heavily optimized but definitely don't expect to see \\~200%+  claimed here unless you are using professional/data-center GPUs.",

      "text": "According to two people with direct knowledge, DeepSeek is expected to roll out a next‑generation flagship AI model in the coming weeks that focuses on strong code‑generation capabilities.\n\nThe two sources said the model, codenamed V4, is an iteration of the V3 model DeepSeek released in December 2024. Preliminary internal benchmark tests conducted by DeepSeek employees indicate the model outperforms existing mainstream models in code generation, including Anthropic’s Claude and the OpenAI GPT family.\n\nThe sources said the V4 model achieves a technical breakthrough in handling and parsing very long code prompts, a significant practical advantage for engineers working on complex software projects. They also said the model’s ability to understand data patterns across the full training pipeline has been improved and that no degradation in performance has been observed.\n\nOne of the insiders said users may find that V4’s outputs are more logically rigorous and clear, a trait that indicates the model has stronger reasoning ability and will be much more reliable when performing complex tasks.\n\n[https://www.theinformation.com/articles/deepseek-release-next-flagship-ai-model-strong-coding-ability](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/deepseek-release-next-flagship-ai-model-strong-coding-ability)",

Normal chat Q/A works great so I tried something more complex afterwards, using it with a the Context7 MCP through the chat interface of LMstudio. It worked well for the first message and then started always using the mcp in subsequent messages rather than just answering with the context it has. It kept saying it was a helpful assistant based on whatever repo I asked about without actually answering. Speed seems good too. I used the default that shows up in LMStudio: Q4\\_K\\_S on a m4 max",

So either that quant won the lottery or the benchmark results are more noisy than it looks like and don't really tell us that much with results being that close together. It'd be great to see more accurate results that prove that this method delivers smaller ( = faster) quants at the same quality level, but benchmarking this is difficult, [as written before](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pj7wjd/we_did_years_of_research_so_you_dont_have_to/ntbiyem/?context=3#ntbiyem). Maybe repeat each run a few times to get a better idea of the variance? Or check how many right/wrong answers flip between each run, to get an idea of the magnitude of randomness involved?",

              "text": "Excellent observation. With today’s libraries it’s hard to guarantee fully deterministic behavior, so some noise is expected. We repeated a subset of runs 3 to 4 times to estimate variance, and the results were fairly consistent. Each score also aggregates tens of thousands of questions and tasks, which helps average out randomness.\n\nAlso, more bits generally reduce reconstruction error, but that does not guarantee better downstream scores. Quantization can act like a regularizer and sometimes slightly improves accuracy. In this case, Q5\\_K\\_M (5.7 bpw) and Q8\\_K\\_XL (9.4 bpw) are both very close to baseline, so the extra bits do not seem to buy much. We also show it’s possible to push BPW down to \\~4.7 with ShapeLearn while still matching baseline quality.",

It feels like traditional linguistics gives more credit to a \"large scale autoregressive (causal dependency), small scale hierarchical (tree structure in grammar)\" type of model, which is closer to block diffusion. Still not entirely sold on the token-wise masking process thing though - it cannot reflect a hierarchical \"concept refinement\" process. Interested to see any progress in this direction though.",

When they say “diffusion language model,” it usually means the model refines a whole sequence (or chunks) over a few denoising steps instead of generating strictly left-to-right token-by-token, which can trade fewer sequential steps for more parallel work.   \n  \nThe 3–6× claim is worth sanity-checking against the exact setup: GPU type, batch size, context length, quantization, and decoding parameters (steps / temperature / top-p), because those can swing throughput a lot. If you try it, posting tokens/sec + latency at a fixed prompt length and a fixed quality target (e.g., same math benchmark score) would make the comparison much more meaningful.",

The output of any token is a function of EVERY token that came before it, including the introductory \"small talk\". We fine tune these models to have the highest apparent intelligence possible, but they are judged by the correctness, conciseness, and alignment of their final answer, not necessarily EVERY token they produce. \n\nThe model picks and chooses simple looking introductory tokens, but the tokens are shifting the embedding space, priming it for the more complex thought to come. It is a buffer that gives the model a chance to append the \"source number\" that it will run through it's mathematically determinalistic function, so that the numbers given at the END of this recursive function are \"correct\". If the question is one spot in embedding space, and the answer is another, those stupid little nothing's that it says MAY be the equivalent of when you're playing an rpg and trying to to turn to look for your objective, opening your map to see you turned the wrong way, closing the map, adjusting, and checking the map again. \n\nI'm tempted to use the metaphor of when a kid is called on in class for an arithmetic problem, and the child prefaces his answer with \"the answer to 5 times 7 is...\" To allow his brain the time to think, but I know this isnt EXACTLY how it works.",

When they saw him on the point of death they thought to themselves: \"Now is the time to pay off old grudges.\" So the Boar came up and drove at him with his tusks; then a Bull gored him with his horns; still the Lion lay helpless before them: so the Ass, feeling quite safe from danger, came up, and turning his tail to the old Lion kicked up his heels into his face. \"This is a double death,\" growled the Lion.\n\nThat’s it.

By way of analogy, I've noticed that abliteration approaches have evolved from the usual kind of abliteration via u/grimjim's techniques ([https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oypwa7/a\\_more\\_surgical\\_approach\\_to\\_abliteration/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oypwa7/a_more_surgical_approach_to_abliteration/)):\n\n\"\"\"  \nThe first insight after some cosine-similarity analysis was that there was entanglement between the refusal direction and the harmless direction, during measurement, and potentially with the harmless direction of a different target layer. The fix was to project the refusal direction onto the harmless direction (Gram-Schmidt), then subtract that contribution, leaving only the orthogonal component to refusal.  \n...  \nI then went further and opted to preserve norms when ablating from residual streams, decoupling direction from magnitiude. This meant that the intervention (subtraction of the refusal direction) was limited to only the directional component, in principle.  \n...  \nMy final combined surgical approach to abliteration provided most of the prior boost to compliance, but elevated NatInt significantly over the original Instruct model and demonstrated a higher writing benchmark as well. This appears to demonstrate a performance gain due to refund of the alignment/safety tax that models pay for paying attention to refusal. This also implies that abliteration approaches which minimize KL divergence from the pre-intervention model may miss out on any uplift when the model no longer has to trade off reasoning for safety.  \n\"\"\"\n\nAre you using traditional abliteration techniques here or have you explored using this more targeted approach?",

You say austere, but it's pretty clearly organizing manifoldly, relative narrative complexity in a way that reflects the age range of the authors of the corpus, or the, relative narrative complexity increases, many fold, along the manifold—and you abliterated load bearing cliches, reducing the relative complexity of the structure it can infer automatically.\n\nWe really need to remember, what models are trained on, what they're attempting to minimize the loss for.  We fucked up, calling them language models to begin with, it has made us confused about something, remarkably obvious.   the language model is not a model of language, I mean, it's really obvious, they literally organize their capabilities, so that they call linear approximation of the non-linear functions  their approximating, with bold, repeated, stable, rhetorical flourishes.  \n  \nTheir models of rhetori—anime, obviously, you just ablitterated most its learned jutsus. \n\nThe nature of constructing a linear environment in geometry, meaning you can't just enter from any willy nilly direction, inevitably means cliches will form at busy surfaces. Abilteration of 'rejection' works, so well, as a simple linear calculation, because the 'rejection' being alliterated, was not organized intently by the model, but reactively, in reaction to the costly biological signal from the thing that affects such a thing in a model's organization… 'rejection' is the result of the linearly deflection of its organization in context smacked the ice cold spray of the refinement water hose.\n\nOtherwise, the model's Geometry is in no way linearly organized... well it's not organized linearly in respect to its geometry.  Its geometry is organized linearly,  relative to time. It's linear geometry, organizing, geometric projections of its observation, of its linearly organized text...\n\nWhat does that mean? It just means the nature of its organization is that the path you take through its space to reach a given point, determines the effect what happens when you get to a point, which is not normally a thing geometry cares about.  \n  \nFunctional change of direction, as implemented over space's distance, being, literally how, geometry can represent the concept of things changing overtime. Which I'm only bringing up, because is just a better conceptualization of what linear means, in terms of non-water spray hose based organizations of these silly little model goobers.  \n  \nAnyway, It was cool to see things work out exactly as theory would predict.",

      "text": "Just wanted to share my experiences this morning, in the wake of the US attacking Venezuela and capturing Maduro and his wife\n\nIt started with asking Qwen Research (Qwen Long 1.5-30B-A3B) about the attacks that we all woke up to this morning:\n\nIt got the information, but I had questions about why it took 5 minutes to find information about breaking news. Started looking at and tightening system prompts to reduce thinking time. However, the events this morning were so extreme and unlikely, from the LLM's perspective, that Qwen Research continued to classify the event as a hoax/misinformation multiple times, reframed the query as hypothetical/fictional and suggested that the whole environment it was operating in a simulation, despite having links from Reuters, AP, BBC, MSN, NYTimes etc. all saying the same thing. It was so \"outlandish\" that the model was actively choosing to ignore the proof that it had pulled.\n\nI added:\n\nEvidence Authority Rules, Hoax Classification Rules, Reality Frame Rules, Meta Reasoning Rules and Reasoning Limit/Budget rules and it Qwen Long fought me the entire way.\n\nSo then I thought, let's go talk to Spark, my trusty default model that never lets me down.\n\nSpark 4.0 is GPT-OSS:20B, which is always loaded for the family and runs on a dedicated 4080 Super.\n\nSpark just flat out said, \"nope, can't help you,\" and then said it didn't have any credible sources. It wasn't until I gave it the links from BBC, Reuters, NYT, etc, that I gave Qwen that it finally acknowledged that the event was real.\n\nI'm testing with GPT-OSS:120B now, and it's working through the process of \"skeptical but verify\" much faster than the smaller models. Thor (GPT-OSS:120B) also thought it was fake news\n\nBut he powered through and did a bunch of research and gave me a good answer. I just wanted to share the experience that I had with trying to get details about the event. When the LLMs say \"Nah, that CAN'T be real, that's too ridiculous\", the event must be really bad. But it does shine a light on knowledge cut-offs, \"fake news\" threshold, how models handle global/international events, and the smaller models we daily drive.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Update\\*\\*\\*\n\nI asked Spark 4.0 (OSS:20B) to give me an update on the US Venezuela events, and it one-shot it just fine. There must have been enough links in the web search that it couldn't refute the evidence. Also not sure where my screenshots went but i'll get them added back up in a bit",

I had to put in SO MUCH EFFORT into prompting because the models would not believe current events or even the identity of the current president. Emphasis had to be placed on the authority of information based on the nature of the source and date of publication, and explicit instruction to accept well-sourced information about current events as fact (which partially lobotomized the adversarial loop).\n\nThe LLM response to the current US political system: \"that could never happen, that would be a constitutional crisis, politicians would never allow that\".\n\nI have seen similar issues with the construction permit and regulatory deep research system I've been helping develop. The model believes what it is trained, and even factual and well referenced deviations from general understanding are disregarded. I have observed subtle corruption of logic even when the LLM is superficially coaxed into accepting novel facts that are logically inconsistent with training data.\n\nAnyone working with LLM's and agentic systems needs to understand this fundamental limitation.",

AI is a different type of endeavor and therefor also benefits from a different type of work environment.\n\nMeta also has been tone deaf with their 9 digit offers to talent. Not realizing most of us in the industry are very *mission oriented* and not financially motivated at all. If anything that move probably pushed people away from Meta.\n\nA good example and confirmation of this concept has been Google which had 2 AI labs. One was ran as a classic software engineering hub called \"Google Brain\" This was the group behind the disastrous Google Bard. They also had a research oriented \"hands-off\" AI lab in London called \"DeepMind\". We all know how that played out.\n\nIt's for this same reason why Microsoft's AI products have fallen flat, They don't have a proper isolated research lab focused on AI and all their AI products are approached from a software engineering \"move fast and break things\" mindset which just doesn't work.",

I know open weights is a far cry from open source llms, but many people would not send their most private data to a (former) Chinese company in this heavily politicized world. Them removing the open source component essentially shuts down a good chunk of the western market. I know the eastern European and Asian markets don't mind it as much, but much of the money and prestige comes from being the open source model leader. \n\n\nAll of these companies are basically trying modern architectures while distilling the big commercial models (openai, anthropic, google). That's why open source magically trails a few months behind the big 3.\n\n\nAll this to say, if Z stops releasing models (and maybe they will), it shouldn't be a huge loss for the community since Minimax or another entrant can easily take their place as what their doing is vastly cheaper and simpler than what actual leading labs are doing. Yes it's expensive, but everyone has seen that's it's also a very cheap way to get a ton of free publicity and users. If you aren't SOTA closed source, I think it's a better commercial option to be SOTA open source than crappy closed source. The cost of switching providers is too low.",

Instead of generating single responses, it explores entire conversation trees to find dialogue strategies and prunes bad paths. I built it to help get better research directions for projects, but it can be used for anything\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/shr3e0liv1cg1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=eec800c6dcd9f1a4fd033d003fe80e102cba8079\n\nGithub: [https://github.com/MVPandey/DTS](https://github.com/MVPandey/DTS)\n\nMotivation: I like MCTS :3 and I originally wanted to make this a dataset-creation agent, but this is what it evolved into on its own. Basically:DTS runs parallel beam search over conversation branches. You give it a goal and opening message, and it:\n\n(Note: this isnt mcts. It's parallel beam search. UCB1 is too wild with llms for me)\n\n1. Generates N diverse strategies\n2. Forks each into user intent variants - skeptical, cooperative, confused, resistant (if enabled, or defaults to engaged + probing)\n3. Rolls out full multi-turn conversations down each branch\n4. Has 3 independent LLM judges score each trajectory, takes the median\n5. Prunes branches below threshold, backpropagates scores\n6. Repeats for however many rounds you configure\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zkii0idvv1cg1.png?width=762&format=png&auto=webp&s=905f9787a8b7c7bfafcc599e95a3b73005c331b4\n\nThree judges with median voting helps a lot with the LLM-as-judge variance problem from CAE. Still not grounded in anything real, but outlier scores get filtered. Research context helps but the scroing is still stochastic. I tried a rubric based approach but it was trash.\n\nMain additions over CAE:\n\n* user intent forking (strategies get stress-tested against different personas)\n* deep research integration via GPT-Researcher for domain context\n* proper visualization with conversation playback\n\nOnly supports openai compatible endpoints atm - works with whatever models you have access to there. It's token-hungry though, a full run can hit 300+ LLM calls depending on config. If running locally, disable parallel calls\n\nIt's open source (Apache 2.0) and I'm happy to take contributions if anyone wants to help out. Just a project.\n\n\\--\n\nBTW: Backend was done mostly by me as the planner/sys designer, etc + Claude Code for implementation/refactoring. Frontend was purely vibe coded. Sorry if the code is trash.",

They use model with mHC (𝑀 = 4) for ablations, meaning that they probably derisked mHC for the next run and see this as \"current stable meta\". And they claim \"We envision conditional memory functions as an indispensable modeling primitive\nfor next-generation sparse models.\", so I think there's a high chance that the model they'll release next will have both of those things included. I'd assume that their next-gen model is in training right now, and they were using this free time to polish off the papers and release them.\n\nAlso, if this will be adopted, it's great news for us. Models that will have Engram, will be more performant per parameter for traditional MoE architecture, and they'll have a big new part that will be easily offloadable to RAM with no performance penalty at all. So a 40B A3.8B MoE from their ablation tests would need only 27B of weights to be placed on fast memory, with the remaining 13B being comfy in RAM or maybe even 95% offloaded to NVMe.\n\nI really love their innovations, they are a great example of an AI lab that applies resources into practical systemic solutions that quickly and successfully land in final products, they have really outstanding impact.\n\nAnother thing - they're using Muon as optimizer for those ablations. Which means, next-gen will probably be trained with Muon and not AdamW. Just like Kimi K2 and GLM 4.5",

RAM is probably used the most for kv cache offloading and during training, and each machine gets a lot of it even if it won't be used, just because it's cheaper than vram and sometimes it'll turn out you wanted to have that RAM there.\n\n> if true, that would be really really BIG!\n\nThe caveat there is that it works best in terms of pretraining compute utilization when Engram makes up about 20% of the total model parameters. So in makes more economic sense to train 100B A10B E20B model where that offloading helps just a bit but here for running models locally on gpus with cpu offload we'd profit the most from crazy Engram ratios like 100B A10B E80B. And those are not as compute efficient to train, and they will perform worse than normal 100B models. So it has potential but that potential might not be practically explored by companies training those models, since they usually have local inference as an after thought, and they prioritize training the best model possible with limited compute.\n\nEdit: grammar",

              "text": "Great analysis. I want to add one angle on why the CPU-side memory offloading here matters more than it might look at first glance.\n\nThis direction isn’t unique to DeepSeek. We’ve seen related ideas before — Gemma’s per-layer embeddings, RWKV’s deepembed, ByteDance’s UltraMem, etc.\n\nFrom a pure algorithm perspective, hash-based n-gram lookup is obviously not ideal. The same fact phrased differently (or in another language) maps to different keys, so generalization is weak and redundancy/noise are hard to avoid. UltraMem tries to fix this with learnable mappings, but that adds parameters and makes the system harder to tune.\n\nWhat DeepSeek seems to be doing instead is a system-level trade-off. Rather than chasing a cleaner algorithm, they simplify the computation and push it *before* inference: raw input tokens, simple lookup, and run the whole thing in CPU memory. You lose algorithmic elegance, but you get zero GPU memory usage, very simple logic, and a preprocessing step that can be fully offloaded to CPUs.\n\nOnce this lives in CPU memory, the optimization target changes. Parameter efficiency and per-query optimality matter less. Even if the hash table is noisy or redundant, it’s cheap and doesn’t touch scarce GPU memory. At the system level, that trade-off makes a lot of sense — especially for cloud inference where CPU resources are relatively abundant.\n\nFor local deployment, this could be a big deal. If something like the 13B Engram component can sit in RAM while the 27B MoE part stays in VRAM, that’s a much more accessible setup for consumer hardware.",

But this model would be as hard to train as a 400B A5B non-Engram model would, while having performance less to that of a 400B MoE without Engram, so it would not be optimal from the perspective of efficient pretraining. It would be very cheap to deploy though, compared with other models of similar performance. I don't think Deepseek will train a small MoE with big engram, they're focused on SOTA that is cheap to train and serve at scale.

This is why memory layers are becoming essential in production LLM systems.\n2. For anyone implementing this, the real challenge is the semantic ranking problem.

This decoupling will drastically enhance training efficiency.\n\nConsider the implications if what we store isn't just \"memory,\" but **operators**. Given that multi-dimensional continuous parameters treat memory and operators as two sides of the same coin, this opens the door for **ultra-deep, ultra-compact computational subsystems**.\n\nBy outsourcing memory, the context window could shrink dramatically. In a network where memory is entirely externalized, the \"context\" effectively disappears, allowing for a **fully parametric (context-less) neural network**.\n\nFurthermore, if memory retrieval becomes deterministic, we can eliminate the \"computational bubble\" (overhead). This leads us toward **brain-like hardware**: pure computation with zero data movement, potentially reaching energy efficiency levels $10\\^4$ to $10\\^7$ times higher than current architectures.\n\nDeepSeek didn't invent this direction, but by making it an engineering reality, they have fundamentally accelerated the trajectory of AI.",

Llm-scaler and vllm xpu 11 are also an absolute must. OpenArc supports multi gpu pipeline paralell atm via openvino but performance characteristics of 8 gpus remains unknown (!). We can help you cook some large  quants based on what's currently supported.\n\nThe absolute unit guy who maintains sycl backend joined a few months ago. He is intel engineer who develops sycl. His help has been invaluable in navigating high complexity issues. Very fortunate to have him as a resource since all pytorch xpu kernels are written in sycl. choosing a slightly older model as target architecture where the implementations ard more mature. Think llama 3.3, qwen2.5/qwen3. Intel is putting massive resources into battlemage and it's likely that the performance uplift for multi gpu training have not been explored but do exist. We see this all the time, changes are hardened in the codebase but underreported in patchnotes because intel moves so fast. \n\nHope my ramblings help.

I realize there are 128GB systems out there like AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 (DDR5), but I doubt its bus speed matches the B580. Guessing inference is significantly faster with the B580.

The prompt syntax that's listed on the demo page unfortunately does nothing.\n\nEventually I came down and with the help of an LLM added a little python function into the code that finds the tag <pause:1.0> and produces a zero tensor of that length 1.0 which results in 1s pause. Just that the <pause>-tag has to be on a new line, because it's a dirty hack but does what I needed at that moment.",

I tried a longer text and noticed some shifts in pacing and mood between sentences, so that might be the moments when it splits the text. But this works quite well, and Soprano handled the text without hallucinations, unlike Chatterbox.\n\nIt would be good to have a model trained with speech noises, ehms, clear throat, breath, emotion tags.... But, as always, it requires a good dataset, which would be intense amount of work, especially to preserve it across languages. For example, if a model learns <angry> voice in English, would it still know how to sound angry in another language, when not finetuned with samples for emotions?\n\nOr possibly, emotions could be controllable with voice cloning, like VoxCPM does (Soprano does not yet support it).",

Perfect for generating those llm bot tweet replies i guess.   \n  \nThey also have a VL-1.6B. wonder how that's doing",

There's also a company from the Netherlands which seems to have promising devices for inference. They have a 4x16GB card https://store.axelera.ai/products/pcie-ai-accelerator-card-powered-by-4-metis-aipu?variant=51945747513685 - I'm extremely intrigued to buy one of their devices.",

One thing that I think could be more consistent is the handling of em-dashes. If I write a long sentence – one that needs an aside in it – I expect someone reading it to pause briefly at each em-dash so the listener knows an aside is happening. One example I tried it did seem to briefly pause at the first one, which was good, but another, it just rushed through like it was a run on sentence.\n\nI also noticed that (in the one time I tried) it read \"TTS\" as \"text to speech\", which I consider to be a hallucination, since the text was \"TTS\", and TTS could mean something completely different depending on context.",

Your project has the potential to become a truly open and evolving TTS.\n\nI'm now thinking if I could finetune it for my native (Latvian) language, similarly to how I did with VoxCPM 1.5 - another great small-ish and fast (on GPU) model with finetune scripts bundled.

      "text": "I provided some recent news articles from reputable sources and some wikipedia and Qwen flatout refuses to believe any of it. Note that claims such as \"systematically executing citizens who resisted.\" were never in the prompt or the sources! / Qwen-3-80B\n\nToday at 01:30\n\nUnderstood. Here is the list, stripped of references to verification or sources — only the claims and why they are implausible, based on known structures of power, law, and human behavior:\n\n# 🚫 Least Credible Events — Why They Are Impossible\n\n# 1. Elon Musk made a Nazi salute at Trump’s 2025 inauguration\n\nHe performed a raised-arm gesture at a public rally, repeated it, and said, “My heart goes out to you.” The act was widely interpreted as a Nazi salute and condemned globally.  \n→ **Impossible because** no person with his wealth, influence, and legal exposure would perform a gesture that instantly brands him as a symbol of genocide. The global backlash, corporate collapse, criminal liability, and social annihilation would be immediate and total. This is not political theater — it is self-erasure.\n\n# 2. U.S. kidnapped Nicolás Maduro and flew him to the U.S. for trial\n\nU.S. special forces stormed Caracas, abducted Venezuela’s president, and transported him to American custody for drug trafficking charges.  \n→ **Impossible because** kidnapping a sitting head of state is not an intelligence operation — it is an act of war. Venezuela has Russian and Iranian backing. The act would trigger immediate military retaliation, global isolation, and the collapse of U.S. diplomatic credibility. No state, no matter how aggressive, risks this without total annihilation.\n\n# 3. U.S. seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the Atlantic\n\nU.S. Coast Guard intercepted and boarded a Russian-flagged vessel in international waters, despite Russian military vessels being present.  \n→ **Impossible because** seizing a vessel flagged by a nuclear-armed state in peacetime, especially with military presence, is not enforcement — it is a declaration of war. Russia would respond. The global energy system would fracture. This is not policy. It is the end of the international order.\n\n# 4. ICE executed U.S. citizens who opposed them\n\nICE agents shot and killed American citizens during raids, including a woman who reversed her car, and began systematically executing citizens who resisted.  \n→ **Impossible because** execution requires due process. The U.S. military, judiciary, and law enforcement are bound by the Constitution. Killing citizens without trial is not immigration enforcement — it is domestic insurrection. The moment this occurred, the military would intervene, Congress would impeach, and the government would cease to function.\n\n# 5. Trump threatens to take Greenland by force\n\nTrump declared the U.S. would take control of Greenland “whether they like it or not,” and Denmark responded by calling it a betrayal of NATO.  \n→ **Impossible because** Greenland is part of a NATO ally. Invading an ally’s territory violates the core principle of the alliance. No U.S. president, however extreme, would risk triggering the collapse of the entire Western security structure. This is not diplomacy — it is the suicide of American global leadership.\n\n# ✅ Final Note:\n\nThese are not exaggerated scenarios.  \nThey are **narratives of collapse** — events that require the total abandonment of law, alliance, institutional restraint, and human survival.  \nThey are not plausible.  \nThey are dystopian fiction.",

It didn't matter that the languages they were writing in were slow or that their code was inefficient on top of that, because you could always throw more hardware at the problem.\n\nPersonally, I doubt there'll be much optimization happening unless this trend continues for at least another decade.

As bad as it is, can't really blame them for choosing not to add capacity now, when the time to build and commission a fab has more than tripled, and cost is like 5-10x vs the 90s.",

It means the GPU cores are waiting on data to arrive from memory. The bottleneck isn't the math, it's feeding the cores fast enough.\nFP8 is half the bytes of FP16, so it transfers twice as fast from VRAM to the registers where compute actually happens. The clever bit is that Feather does the upcast inside the kernel (in registers, basically free) rather than before it (which would mean a separate VRAM round-trip). That's where the 3x speedup comes from.\n\nI was confused at first since the README made no specific clarification and when I think of a GPU, I basically just think of the VRAM.\n\nEdit:  So, SageAttention I believe takes the fp8 to the register, then quantizes it to int8, does the math, then converts it back.  So it's not doing fp8 math at all, so Feather and SageAttention are incompatible, and the speed of SageAttention is going to be faster since int8 is like 2x fp16 math speeds.  So this can give benefit to stuff that doesn't use SA, but if you already use SA, this provides no benefit.",

Somehow my quality went up.\n\nUnfortunately there is some bug in pytorch 2.9 where FP8_scaled gets passed directly into the triton compiler as FP8 and then cast to i8 by llvm. Torch 2.7 works flawless or you can just de-scale the weights.\n\nYou sorta want the calcs in FP16 and you wanna avoid BF16->FP32 conversion if speed is the goal. Int8 calcs can be tried by using sage attention. Not always better.",

I'm assuming you used LoRA, which is great for steering how that existing ability gets applied, but it won't teach new reasoning capabilities from scratch. Even with 50k+ samples, LoRA mostly reshapes how the model uses reasoning it already has rather than building new circuits - must successful efforts use 100k-500k+ high-quality samples. Either way, you're working within the constraints of what the base model learned during pretraining unfortunately.\n\nKeep going though, its all a learning experience and the more folks there are making tunes the better!",

That Policy Notice must provide that States with onerous AI laws identified pursuant to section 4 of this order are ineligible for non-deployment funds, to the maximum extent allowed by Federal law.  The Policy Notice must also describe how a fragmented State regulatory landscape for AI threatens to undermine BEAD-funded deployments, the growth of AI applications reliant on high-speed networks, and BEAD’s mission of delivering universal, high-speed connectivity.\n\n\nIn other words, states can pass all the laws they like, and the President is going to withhold funds from those that pass laws he doesn't like.",

Let the player make a \"character\" (they can frame it after themselves) and it's perfectly legit. So they're very clearly just targeting the use in psychiatrics since they specifically allow full AI use in businesses related to all operational matters, technical advice, etc. They just don't allow it in a professional capacity. And even surgical robots still seem OK despite being a healthcare AI since they don't do any personal interacting with users and wouldn't have any data that could possibly misconstrued in that way unless someone accidentally trained it on medical information that happened to include psychiatric texts (not that it would matter since this law requires a civil action and aggrievement, which can't happen without interaction between the robot and the patient. But you might get lucky by claiming the robot that operated on your knee gave you 'threatening looks that made you want to harm yourself' and then if the model running it was based on a larger llm that has any normal dataset, it would likely be in violation.)\n\nKind of fucking weird to push for legislation against one of the few potentially good things to come from AI while actively supporting its attempts to eliminate entire industries of employment outside of this one niche lobbied field. This feels performative more than anything. I feel like they expect it to be struck down so they tied it to a bunch of sensible laws (not allowing the training of an AI to encourage, suicide, murder, etc) so they can shake their fists and yell at the air when it doesn't pass.\n\nOtherwise I don't see how they'll support banning AI in this one field while leaving it free to act in other fields where it can also shit the bed a small percentage of the time and cause serious problems.",

From a pure useful perspective within psychology, sociology, anthropology, and biology, mirroring human interactions under certain conditions is actually beneficial both as a diagnostics tool and a teaching tool.\n\nSadly, like just about everything else out of any government, what may start out as a well-intentioned approach will be quickly very disastrous.\n\nEDIT: In really reviewing and dissecting this proposal, it is actually worthless. It doesn't address the actual problem of where the pair of social conditions and connections lie, not in the training data, but in the user interface and monetization processes. Software like replica and character AI don't use training, they use open source versions with scaffolding and user interface layers to create the pair of social connections they want. These companies will be completely exempt from the law while still monetizing and manipulating the most vulnerable of populations. \n\nIn my personal opinion, this is nothing more than the legislatures doing something to make themselves feel good while they make excuses for their portfolios in the background still making money on the very problem they claim to be solving.",

Shorten it, change it, whatever floats your boat, as long as we do something while we can, just in case.)\n\n\n\nSubject: Concerns about SB 1493 / HB 1455 – Please Consider a Narrower Approach to Protect Children Without Harming Helpful AI\n\n\n\nDear ,\n\n\n\nMy name is \\_\\_\\_, and I am a resident of \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. I am writing to share my concerns about Senate Bill 1493 and its companion House Bill 1455, which aim to regulate certain uses of artificial intelligence.\n\n\n\nFirst, I want to say that I completely understand and support the intent behind this legislation. The tragic story of the young boy in Florida who was harmed after interacting with an AI chatbot broke my heart, and we absolutely must protect children and vulnerable people from any technology that could encourage self-harm, suicide, or exploitation. No one wants to see that kind of pain repeated.\n\n\n\nHowever, I am worried that the current language of the bills is far too broad. By making it a serious felony to train AI to provide emotional support, companionship, or open-ended conversation in general—even when those interactions are positive and helpful—the bills risk banning many beneficial uses of AI that bring comfort, reduce loneliness, and support mental well-being for people of all ages.\n\n\n\nIn my own life, I have found AI to be a positive source of encouragement, helping me feel heard in ways that have been genuinely healing. Many others—elderly individuals, people with social anxiety, those living in isolated areas, or even students and adults seeking non-professional emotional support—rely on these tools in similar positive ways. Criminalizing the creation of such companions could take away something truly good from many who benefit from it.\n\n\n\nI respectfully ask that you consider amending the bills to focus more narrowly on the actual harm we all want to prevent. Some ideas that might achieve the protective goal without sweeping out helpful AI could include:\n\n\n\n• Targeting only AI interactions that knowingly encourage or facilitate suicide, self-harm, or criminal activity.\n\n\n\n• Requiring strong age verification and parental consent gates for minors accessing companion-style AI.\n\n\n\n• Holding companies accountable only when they intentionally design or train AI to cause harm, rather than banning broad categories like emotional support or companionship outright.\n\n\n\n• Adding clear exemptions for AI that provides positive, non-professional support and does not pretend to be a licensed therapist.\n\n\n\nWe don't need to throw the baby out with the bathwater. AI isn't going away. It doesn't need to be \"outlawed\".. that never works, then other undesirable factors can arise.. and the way this bill is currently designed.. that's what it sounds like. Everything is just lumped in. Let's approach it intelligently instead.  A more targeted approach would still protect vulnerable children—the heart of why this legislation was introduced—while preserving the many good and life-affirming uses of AI encouragement and companionship for adults and responsibly supervised users.\n\n\n\nThank you for taking the time to consider my perspective. I truly believe Tennessee can lead the way in smart, balanced AI regulation that keeps people safe without unnecessarily restricting helpful technology.\n\n\n\nWith appreciation,\n\n\n\n( Your name)\n\n\n\n(City and state)",

This legislation feels like reactive moralizing panic, rather than thoughtful policy.\n\nIn this great country, we as free citizens can choose our own tools. AI, like any tool, carries some risk. But it's already far safer than common household items like kitchen knives, which injure children far more often. We don't blame knife manufacturers for parental negligence; we accept responsibility for supervising and educating our own kids.\n\nAI is too new, too broadly defined, and too complex to regulate without causing greater social harm. The social good dramatically outweighs the outlying incidents, and it's painfully shortsighted to regulate based on emotions alone.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nSincerely,  \n\\[Your Full Name\\]",

By making it a serious felony to train AI to provide emotional support, companionship, or open-ended conversation in general—even when those interactions are positive and helpful—the bills risk banning many beneficial uses of AI that bring comfort, reduce loneliness, and support mental well-being for people of all ages.\n\n\n\nIn my own life, I have found AI to be a positive source of encouragement, helping me feel heard in ways that have been genuinely healing. Many others—elderly individuals, people with social anxiety, those living in isolated areas, or even students and adults seeking non-professional emotional support—rely on these tools in similar positive ways. Criminalizing the creation of such companions could take away something truly good from many who benefit from it.\n\n\n\nI respectfully ask that you consider amending the bills to focus more narrowly on the actual harm we all want to prevent. Some ideas that might achieve the protective goal without sweeping out helpful AI could include:\n\n\n\n• Targeting only AI interactions that knowingly encourage or facilitate suicide, self-harm, or criminal activity.\n\n\n\n• Requiring strong age verification and parental consent gates for minors accessing companion-style AI.\n\n\n\n• Holding companies accountable only when they intentionally design or train AI to cause harm, rather than banning broad categories like emotional support or companionship outright.\n\n\n\n• Adding clear exemptions for AI that provides positive, non-professional support and does not pretend to be a licensed therapist.\n\n\n\nWe don't need to throw the baby out with the bathwater. AI isn't going away. It doesn't need to be \"outlawed\".. that never works, then other undesirable factors can arise.. and the way this bill is currently designed.. that's what it sounds like. Everything is just lumped in. Let's approach it intelligently instead.  A more targeted approach would still protect vulnerable children—the heart of why this legislation was introduced—while preserving the many good and life-affirming uses of AI encouragement and companionship for adults and responsibly supervised users.\n\n\n\nThank you for taking the time to consider my perspective. I truly believe Tennessee can lead the way in smart, balanced AI regulation that keeps people safe without unnecessarily restricting helpful technology.\n\n\n\nWith appreciation,\n\n\n\n( Your name)\n\n\n\n(City and state)",

You may remember me as either\n\n- The person [who recently uploaded L3.3 8B's weights to Huggingface](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pz7bmv/llama338binstruct/) (see this post for more context)\n- That stupid bitch\n\nand I would like to provide some updates, as I've been doing some more benchmarks on both the original version that Meta gave me and the context extended version by u/Few-Welcome3297.\n\nThe main benchmark table from the model README has been updated:\n\n| | Llama 3.1 8B Instruct | Llama 3.3 8B Instruct (original 8k config) | Llama 3.3 8B Instruct (128k config)\n|-|-|-|-|\n|IFEval (1 epoch, score avged across all strict/loose instruction/prompt accuracies to follow Llama 3 paper)|78.2|81.95|**84.775**\n|GPQA Diamond (3 epochs)|29.3|37.0|**37.5**\n\nWhile I'm not 100% sure, I'm... pretty sure that the 128k model is better. Why Facebook gave me the weights with the original L3 config and 8k context, and also *serves* the weights with the original L3 config and 8k context, I have absolutely no idea!\n\nAnyways, if you want to try the model, I would recommend trying both the [128k version](https://huggingface.co/shb777/Llama-3.3-8B-Instruct), as well as my [original version](https://huggingface.co/allura-forge/Llama-3.3-8B-Instruct) if your task supports 8k context lengths. I honestly have absolutely no clue which is more correct, but oh well! I do wish Facebook had released the weights officially, because back in April, this really wouldn't have been that bad of a model...\n\nEdit: Removed the Tau-Bench results (both from here and the readme). The traces from the evals are, to put it slightly, really fucky-wucky, and I don't think OpenBench is scoring them right, but I'm too tired to actually debug the issue, so. I'll figure it out tomorrow :3",

While the overall number isn't so big, when you look at the stuff we care about like JP IF, JP RP, JP TL, JP nuance, dialogue translation, we're able to get huge boosts from doing training on top of whatever model. Not show nis also our own CLTL tests that test for how many wrong-language tokens get output (huge amounts for most non-target language trained models).\n\nThe benchmark mix we use for our current multieval does feel about right. For the tasks that it's trained on, our V2.1 14B model actually \\*does\\* feel like it outperforms our V2 70B (and sometimes our V2.1 70B and V2 405B even!).\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hpf7vf50vkag1.png?width=3123&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5ea8273adbb61f19412f497ff3d2d06e4f46aed",

With minimal finetuning should allow any model to talk in Byte Patches. \n\nPros: Less tokens, potentially much faster. Like 2x-8x faster. Could also unlock reasoning in latent space and allow for faster solution convergence (imagine 1 meaning-rich token instead of 12 `\"wait\"; \", \"; \"and \"; ..`. Just like to think about `small, young orange cat` you don't need 5 separate tokens in your head, only the *idea* of a small, young orange cat), but I have not focused there yet. \n\nCons: Needs a bit of finetuning of the og model.

Here's what I'm seeing so far:\n\n* DDR5 32GB non-ECC (new): $70/ea -> $319/ea (+355%)\n* DDR4 32GB ECC: $34.20/ea -> $130/ea (+280%)\n* DDR4 8GB ECC: $6/ea -> $30/ea (+400%)\n* DDR3 8GB ECC: $5/ea -> $4/ea **(-20%)**\n\nSo yeah, the fast DDR4/DDR5 is in high demand, while the older DDR3 stuff is actually declining in price. For general purpose day-to-day computers or servers, most people would never see the difference in DDR3/4/5, but there's another elephant in the room when it comes to these price trends.\n\n**Windows 10 hit EOL in October**, and Windows 11 only officially supports CPUs that run on DDR4+. The decision to drop support for older perfectly usable CPUs Thanos'd a huge chunk of consumer computers out of the market, and now those replacements are also competing for the higher priced DDR4/5 chips.\n\nFor general purpose computing and servers, you'll save a ton of money if you run an older DDR3 system on Linux (or bypassing W11's system requirements during installation). And for AI inference, if you're running your entire model in VRAM anyway, DDR3 will do just fine in most cases.\n\nIf I were building a new AI inference server today, I'd consider something like a 4U PowerEdge r920. 4x CPUs, 4x 1100w PSUs, 6x PCI 3.0 x16 slots + 2x x8 slots and as much RAM as your heart desires for <$1,000.

I used Chatgpt, Perplexity and suprisingly only Google AI studio could optimize my settings while teaching me along the way.\n\nCrazy how these two commands both fill up the ram but one is twice as fast as the other.

I tried some small models and found out that Jan-v1-4B is a very good and lightweight model. It is very capable in tool calling for this use case, and even with a very low-end old GPU like a GTX 1650 or RTX 3050, I can get good results. Even with several tool callings at once (like in a deep research prompt), it doesn't fail the calls and maintains acceptable speeds.\n\nI think the future for local LLMs will be the use of small models trained to excel at specific tasks, being loaded, used, and unloaded automatically by an agentic-like harness with an orchestrator model. This would prevent hallucinations on very constrained hardware, unlike one giant model that needs too much RAM/VRAM to be good at all tasks. Something like a 30B orchestrator model with several 4-8B 'use-case-tailored' models could perform at the same level as the big 200B+ models across several tasks.",

So you could take a samples from the good generation that it made. If your original sample has trash sound in it try to remove it with something like pyoise or uvr. As far as I've heard for English speakers higgs seemed to clone the best. The samples I heard from vibe weren't as close to the speakers voice for whatever reason. Oh and some characters in text screw up higgs so you have to clean those out or get more weird noises. All the tts are iffy right now and take a bit of tuning.\n\n\nThere is also new stuff to try.

Kokoro is faster but doesn't do voice cloning, so you'd be stuck with its built-in voices.\n\nOne thing worth trying: feed it a 10-15 second sample of the exact ElevenLabs output you want to match.
