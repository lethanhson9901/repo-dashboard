Every new model was practically dead on arrival because of it, despite the better quality. It took 2 years for a new model groundbreaking enough for people to move on and rebuild an ecosystem around it. Llama didn't get to have that smooth headstart",

Main issue is that the cost curve hasn't flattened out yet so no one is making any real money on inferencing.

                  "text": "The reality is quite the opposite of what you think. The biggest disadvantage Chinese AI companies face compared to their American counterparts is a lack of money, while their biggest advantage is freedom.\n\nChinese large model companies are unlikely to receive financial support from the CCP. Why? Because the CCP wants to have its cake and eat it too: they want the computing power, but they also want to control ideology. Before a Chinese large model can be deployed commercially, it must undergo strict \"value alignment.\" Technically speaking, this is equivalent to performing a \"prefrontal lobotomy\" on the model. Consequently, models deployed commercially in China are inherently \"dumber\" than American models in terms of logical reasoning and creativity.\n\nAlthough the CCP detests the content generated by these models, it is desperate for the \"computing infrastructure\" required to train them. Therefore, the CCP’s attitude toward AI is this: go all-in on \"computing centers\" (which falls under heavily subsidized manufacturing), but strangle \"chatbots\" (which falls under ideology). The CCP’s stance on AI large models is a classic case of \"Ye Gong loves dragons\" (professed love for what one actually fears). They love AI as an \"industrial engine\" (driving chip development and boosting manufacturing efficiency), but they are terrified of AI as an \"information interface\" (disseminating uncontrolled ideas to the public). This leads to a truly absurd phenomenon: China may be one of the world's largest investors in computing infrastructure, yet the Chinese people are using the most heavily castrated AI models.\n\nWhy do I say the biggest advantage of Chinese AI is freedom? Because if you don't intend to deploy commercially within China and simply upload your model to Hugging Face, no one will bother you. In the US, for example, before OpenAI releases Sora, it must pass \"red-teaming\" tests; they have to worry about copyright, racial discrimination, and deepfakes influencing elections. This leads to extreme self-censorship.\n\nBut for Chinese AI companies, as long as you don't cross the singular red line (the security of the CCP’s rule), everything else—ethics, copyright, privacy, and even certain radical technical experiments—exists in a regulatory vacuum. It’s just like how, despite US biotechnology being far more advanced than China’s, the first gene-edited babies appeared in China. China possesses a \"low human rights advantage\" and a \"low ethical standards advantage.\"",

Said a little bluntly, llama.cpp is highly specialized code; Ollama could be vibe coded by a 1st/2nd year student. \n\n  \nOllama took llama.cpp and wrapped it in their own app, making things like swapping models extremely easy.  Ollama built a strong reputation and user base as open source software, tightly coupled with the llama.cpp project. They were the usability and utility people, drawing on llama.cpps contstant optimizations and development to accommodate new models, new quantizations, etc. But up until this point, everything that Ollama did was open source. All good. \n\nAbout a year ago, Ollama changed direction towards monetizing their app. They introduced a closed-source desktop app, and made it the default download on their website. They \"forked\" llama.cpp, meaning they started making changes to llama.cpp's code instead of building on top of/wrapping around it (and doing a poor job of it, as you can see). The implications of their fork became clear when Ollama announced 'day 1 support' of some new model. I don't remember which, but it was a big deal. Except their implementation was complete shit, it literally didn't work. A week or so later, Ollama copy/pasted llama.cpp's new code for that model into their fork, and *as far as I remember* either didn't mention it in their release notes, or pretended they had fixed a bug unrelated to their implementation of that model.\n\nThis is a big fucking no-no in open source software. It's not illegal - everything they do complies with llama.cpp's license. But it goes against all norms and conventions.",

Commercial software is built on the back of open source software with permissive licenses. \n\nSome examples:\n- SQLite: embedded in browsers, phones, and operating systems. Most users aren’t aware of or never see attribution.\n- curl: ships inside huge amounts of software and firmware with credit usually buried in a license file somewhere that no one is aware of.\n- React UI libraries: countless packages power proprietary SaaS products and are used on nearly every major site you visit. And many are MIT licensed. \n- BSD networking stack: foundational to macOS, PlayStation, and many WiFi routers.\n- zlib: compression library used in PNG, game engines, operating systems, and tons of commercial software and is rarely visibly credited.\n\nSo, it’s really rich when open source maintainers like ggerganov get salty about people using their code. If you wanted attribution and it was that important to you, an MIT license was the wrong license to choose when setting up the project.",

Extending that, Qwen’s quants do not use imatrix. It’s the last bit that interests me most: I’m actually very skeptical of imatrix-based quantization. It is much more like QAT than most people give it credit for, and the dataset used in calibration can have real downstream effects when it comes, especially, to agentic workflows. No disrespect to the Unsloth team, who are without question incredible allies in the open weights space, but I do prefer non-imatrix quants when available.",

It randomly keeps complaining about non-existing syntax errors in different parts of go code, even though the code is correct. Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct-UD-Q5\\_K\\_XL and the thinking version never behaved like that.\n\nFor example:\n\n    I found the issue! Look at line 41 in pkg/simd/distance.go:\n        return dot / (float32(math.Sqrt(float64(normA))) * float32(math.Sqrt(float64(normB))))\n            \n    There's a syntax error - there's an extra closing parenthesis. The expression should be:\n        return dot / (float32(math.Sqrt(float64(normA))) * float32(math.Sqrt(float64(normB))))\n            \n    But it's currently:\n        return dot / (float32(math.Sqrt(float64(normA))) * float32(math.Sqrt(float64(normB))))\n            \n    This is causing a division by zero or incorrect calculation. Let me fix this:\n\nYet another error/interpretation of the same line:\n\n    I found the bug! Look at line 41 in pkg/simd/distance.go:\n        return dot / (float32(math.Sqrt(float64(normA))) * float32(math.Sqrt(float64(normB))))\n    \n    The issue is that the denominator is being calculated incorrectly. The current code divides by the first sqrt and then multiplies by the second sqrt, which is mathematically wrong. It should be dividing by the product of both norms.\n\nOr another flavor:\n\n    However, there's a subtle bug at line 349:\n        entity_id = entity_title_to_ids[entity.title]\n    \n    This line has a syntax error - it's missing the assignment operator. It should be:\n        entity_id = entity_title_to_ids[entity.title]\n\nYes, a syntax error in perfectly compiling code is very \"subtle\" (as it doesn't exist).",

Using GLM-4.7 Flash with opencode requires me to use the same tricks I had to do with Sonnet 3.7 + claude code, but with everything 1000x cheaper.

(provided the rest can fit into system memory)?\n\nOr is it hard to predict which parameters will become active and the full model should be in VRAM for decent speed?\n\nIn other words can I get away with a quantization where only the active parameters, cache and context fit into VRAM, and the rest can spill into system memory, or will that kill performance?",

So the expert layers run at system ram/CPU inference speed, and the layers on GPU run at GPU speed. However, since there's only 3B active, the CPU isn't going to need to go very fast, and the ram speed isn't as important since it's loading so little. So, you should still get acceptable speeds even with most of the weights on the CPU.\n\nWhat's most important about these next models is the attention architecture. It's slower up front, and benefits most from loading on the GPU, but it's also much more memory efficient, and inference doesn't slow down nearly as much as it fills. This means you can keep probably the full 256k context on a 16GB GPU and maintain high performance for the entire context window.",

I recommend:\n\n* Checking [Walmart.com](http://Walmart.com) or Amazon directly for localized or third-party sellers.\n* Looking at local drugstores (e.g., CVS, Walgreens), discount retailers (e.g., Dollar General, Family Dollar), or grocery stores where shelf prices may differ.\n* Signing up for stock alerts on major sites in case supply improves.\n\nWould you like me to check current prices on a specific retailer (e.g., Walmart, Amazon, or local options)?\n\ngpt120b with the same set of tools and same prompt did 29 tool calls, between searches, page grabs and grabbing a few raw pages and then generated a paragraph summary with the cheapest options.\n\nCoding results look like they are an improvement over gpt120b, with a fully working html tetris clone on its first attempt. gpt120b has yet to manage that one.",

The benchmarks use the api, you don’t get those harnesses in the api.\n\nThe second one is a bit harder to prove, but I believe it. I think it’s the SOUL doc. The study that showed when you RL a model to write malicious code and it starts talking like a Nazi proves the inverse. It stands to reason you RL a model to be moral, it writes better quality code, and does other things well. Harder to empirically prove this inverse, but I think it at least follows.",

Then train RL on that. \n\n\nThe custom AWS hardware has somewhat mitigated the speed issue but it doesn't add up to the higher speed of the hardware.  But it could also be them trying to be profitable.

It does so much better than those beneath it in agentic work, but once it's time to make decisions the gaps between it at the tier above it show.\n\nI love Llama and use Llama 3.3 70B up until very recently when Qwen3-VL-32B, Seed-OSS-36B, and Nemotron-Super-49b-v1.5 started to show knowledge-depth that finally kicked it off my hard drive.\n\nI don't have many vision or ocr use-cases in any of my work/projects so those capabilities weren't taken into account.",

Bear in mind these are college grads, so truly green around the ears.\n\nAlso how I found out that the meetings recorded are being sent to gemini violating who knows how many corporate conditions. If you're not familiar, the uploaded media on AI studio is first pushed to your own personal cloud and then linked from there. Not a \"temp\" upload, it uses your drive as the temp upload storage space - but never deletes anything once uploaded.\n\nZero debugging. Missed a feature and a deadline and I got on a call with them to understand how that could've possibly happened, it was debugging a simple API call response that was throwing up a random 4xx error.\n\nChecking for a response code 200 and logging everything else -> debugging with input and output loads -> sample logs for a batch input to filter and identify root cause. That's all they needed to do. Not even through experience, they could've asked an LLM how to debug a problem and follow the steps.\n\nNope. Not a single one of the three did that; coding muscles had atrophied.\n\nSince then I told management to lock up claude code access for juniors, and to only have it given to them after year 1. Till then they're on the [enterprise] basic free tier github's copilot plan only. Can't say it dramatically improved their skills but atleast they are learning how to Google and be honest, which is enough for now.\n\nI do believe most seniors SHOULD be fine with any GLM model if they can debug and write things independently, though. I myself switch between Antigravity (free opus4.5) for detailed planning then clean up/edit the plan, and get GLM4.7 to work on it. I've set up auto-review and linting, so usually major issues get caught before I even review the final code.",

          "text": "I think there is an other detail: how smart the model is matters less and less, if it can complete the task is more important and at what price/how.\n\nLet's take coding:\n\nSure the top open weights models are close to early (I would put it later) 2025 smarts, but they are also much better at agentic than those models.\n\nAnd the harnesses (tools we use to make an agentic coder) are much better now than in the past, they include for example LSP even on the CLI and more and more people figured out 'plan mode' and the models can generate tests and test it and whole lot of other details...\n\nSo what does this mean ? They can actually finish a lot of tasks on their own (Kimi K2.5 being multi-modal matters a lot here too) and do it for a much lower cost or on your own computer if that's the reason you prefer. So if you compare them to early 2025 this is the wrong way to look at it. Not only that: if they can finish a task: it's far more often 'good enough', which is how for example DOS and Windows got popular (and network effect, monopoly abuse, etc. obviously), it wasn't perfect, but good enough to get stuff done.\n\nI think we are gonna be in a much more: multi-model world, where you might be using or example Kimi K2.5 a lot, but when you need to make a plan you pick Opus and when you need to digest a lot of data cheaply, you might pick Gemini 3 Flash because of it's 1M context window, etc.\n\nThe next problem is: you need to keep doing some coding to keep your coding muscle.",

I think Gemini 3 Pro is the best one to discuss anything with or bounce ideas off of as it takes instructions well and doesn’t moralise or get distracted with safetyslop. \n\nBut since google heavily cut AI studio rate limits and the Gemini app and subscription is terrible, I wouldn’t be using that either. Hence, trying out the new Kimi 2.5 lately. But GPT-5.2 is truly horrendous. I was trying to discuss economics, my field, and harshly critiqued some economist only for it be hyper condescending about “let’s set that aside”, “I’m gonna draw a firm line”, and “I won’t endorse harsh language”. Okay, go and fuck yourself. Uninstalled the app soon after. ",

The real gap shows in long-context coherence and multi-turn debugging.\n\n\n\n4. \\*\\*Size/performance tradeoff is underrated\\*\\*: Qwen3-235B is the sweet spot for self-hosted—enough intelligence for real work without needing a data center. The jump to K2.5 territory requires massive compute that most can't justify.\n\n\n\nThe fact that we're even having \"SOTA vs early 2025\" debates about open weights is wild progress.",

Prompt adherence is actually excellent but you need to be verbose (you can't use tags list; otherwise you need to use format button in the GUI) and I never have an issue getting the model to replicate lyrics that consists of multiple languages.\n\nThe audio quality is somewhat muffled and dissolvy, with or without custom lora, like it had a bit of low-bit bitcrusher or something, which is the largest issue to me. Not something you would use in production. Otherwise it is excellent, it has a lot of niche genre/instruments/technique knowledge that you can enable with a bit of LoRA training.\n\nEdit: I played with this for 2 days and I must say it's VERY good for what it is, but the documentation is scarce and I'm yet to figure out how to use other modes like lego. I am hoping for better quality-sounding iteration in the future. Artifacts are still a bit annoying.",

Especially given how fast the samples are generated!\n\nWith better prompts refinement and better understanding of how to use the model (keep in mind the online demo has a much reduced set of features compared to the downloadable full model, and I could not get my head around how to use the repainting feature), it certainly is a game changer for local ai music generation.\n\nTip: it seems it can \"learn\" additional musical theory skills by giving a reference song, and what is particularly interesting is that this happens even if the target musical style is totally different from the reference song, the model can abstract musical concepts beyond the style. For example, it learnt to do complex musical phrasing here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=as72R3cx0iQ",

Don’t attribute malice so quickly. \n\nI’m not picking any sides, but let’s be rational and not entitled. I don’t like when people are so quick to attribute malice and shit on developers for not only releasing a model but also being kind and receptive enough to do it under an MIT license. And while it was said in quite a rude way, I do believe Junmin was only talking about their Gradio demo, not dictating how we should use the model.\n\nNow for the tech bit:\n\nWhat happens now in the Gradio demo is (to my knowledge) not any conspiracy, but rather the audio being turned into LM codes that get used for the diffusion process. Effectively, you only really preserve the structure, some rhythm, and a hint of the melody that way. Like a description. Ergo, it’s more of a remix/suggestion/alternate reality version. Junmin (one of the authors of this) says he regrets even calling it cover in the first place. \n\nThat’s because the source audio is NOT currently being applied to the diffusion process like it is in other “cover” features or even image-to-image models, so it only has that structural metadata to go off of. Of course, it sounds nothing like the input. It’s a bit like asking Gemini to describe an image in as much detail as possible, then taking that text, then running Nano Banana on the result - it’ll be similar but different, because you went through a whole layer of abstraction to get to the result. \n\nBut what you want is an editing workflow, so sending an image to Nano Banana and having it change the image, not guess from a different modality. \n\nAnd this seems like a trivial fix inside something like ComfyUI - just use the VAE, encode input audio, compose encoded audio over random noise (with different proportions to control strength), pass into diffusion, adjust denoising amount (to control strength in a different way), boom, you’ll get a cover. Bonus points if you combine it with the structural LM codes to get probably either a horrible result if they clash, or a really good one if they don’t.",

This is similar to Minimax M2.1 with 0 context, but I notice very little speed degradation as the context increases. \n\nSo far it is looking like a gem.

It's such a shame. These new models (Dots, GLM, Step, etc.) write fantastic code! They're so strong! They just can't do reliable tool calling and so they don't get used.

It's consistent, it calls tools properly, etc.\n\nBut it's sort of old... it's been so long since GPT-OSS came out and we haven't really had a decent all-around open-weights/source replacement for it (some may argue GLM4.5 Air, but I personally feel like that model is only really better in agentic software dev, and lags behind in everything else. It's also slower and larger at full precision.)\n\nI'm no expert when it comes to how LLM training/etc works, so forgive me if some of my questions are dumb, but:  \n\\- Why don't people train more models in 4-bit natively, like GPT-OSS? Doesn't it reduce training costs? Is there some downside I'm not thinking of?  \n\\- I know GPT-OSS was fast in part due to it being A3B, but there are plenty of smaller, dumber, NEWER A3B models that are much slower. What else makes it so fast? Why aren't we using what we learned from GPT-OSS in newer models?  \n\\- What about a model (like GPT-OSS) makes it feel so much better? Is it the dataset? Did OpenAI just have a dataset that was THAT GOOD that their model is still relevant HALF A YEAR after release?",

It is just that even with most of the weights at 4 bits, that one is far too large for most of us.",

They delayed an open source release multiple times and clearly put on a lot of effort to make the model high quality. \n\n\nI doubt it is one single thing that is the reason why the model is great. Lots experimentation prior to this final model, heavy data curation, a lot of pre training, and a lot of post training. \n\n\nThe two models fit for a consumer GPU (20b) and a single server GPU (120b) . They are remarkably fast and cheap for the capability they provide. Some companies may also release a 4 bit or mixed precision quant, but I at least have not seen benchmarks in that low precision or them deployed on the cloud at that precision. So if you run something that is benchmarked at 32 bit or 16 bit precision and you run it locally, you are probably using something between 4 and 8 not quants. Quantization does retain a lot, but you do lose some capability and that loss is likely what is less visible to standard benchmarks. \n\n\nIt is a shame so many people shit on the model when it came out. Much less likely that they will be as motivated to release a new version because of that or with the same frequency as they would have if the initial reception was better.\n\n\nI have been meaning to spend more time exploring what can be done with it given the incredible speed and cheap price. ",

Both GPT-OSS-120B and GPT-OSS-20B refuse to finish large refactors even if the plan is carefully modular where Devstral Small 2 repeatedly obliterates - it has been my main replacement along with GLM 4.7 Flash as backup for long, less complex tasks. \n\nI do envy GPT-OSS speeds, because my Devstral Small 2 at Q8 just runs slightly quicker than a 120B and that's mental. \n\nIf OpenAi releases an updates OSS, that's gonna rock.",

It always takes the quickest and easiest path to a solution, even if the solution does not completely solve the problem. You really have to prod it along to get it to solve anything but simple problems.

We initially tried to save budget by looking at standard PCIe servers instead of the HGX/SXM form factors, and honestly, the \"paper math\" vs. reality was a brutal wake-up call.))\n\n^(Thought this might save someone else the headache if you're trying to move from inference to actual training runs on-prem.)\n\n^(1. The \"NVLink Tax\" isn't optional for training. We tried to model this out with PCIe Gen5, but the math just falls apart. When you're doing All-Reduce ops across nodes, PCIe caps out at \\~128 GB/s. NVLink is pushing \\~900 GB/s. If you cheap out here, you basically end up with expensive GPUs sitting idle, waiting for data. For inference, PCIe is totally fine. For training, it’s a bottleneck that kills your ROI.)\n\n^(2. Storage checkpoints are violent. This was the biggest surprise. Everyone talks about GPU VRAM, but nobody warned us about the checkpoint writes. A 175B model dumps a \\~2.5TB checkpoint. To keep the GPUs from stalling, you need to write that to disk in under a minute. Our standard NFS filer absolutely choked. We had to look at parallel filesystems (Weka/VAST or local NVMe raid just to survive the write bursts.))\n\n^(3. You don't need InfiniBand, but Ethernet is annoying. We didn't have the budget/staff for an InfiniBand fabric, so we went with RoCEv2 on standard switches. It works, but it’s finicky. One silent buffer overflow or a misconfigured PFC (Priority Flow Control setting can stall the whole cluster. If you go Ethernet, monitor your pause frames religiously.))\n\n^(Anyway, I wrote up a longer deep dive with the specific diagrams and our decision framework for \"Sandbox vs Production\" builds if anyone is interested. Link is pinned in my profile.)\n\n^(Happy to answer questions on the networking side - that RoCEv2 tuning took years off my life.)",

To fight the PCIe bottleneck, try to crank up your Gradient Accumulation steps. Basically, do more work locally on the card before syncing.

The former lacks dedicated tensor memory (TMEM) which means you have to use register based tensor instructions . This makes it a pain to find kernels that even work (e.g for flash attention or QAT) and sometimes requires you to write your own, and even then it’s a lot harder to saturate sm120 tensor cores in flash attention kernels because the tensor instructions use so many registers that you can’t issue enough warps to saturate the memory controllers.

You absolutely lose out trying to use that for training. \n\nQuick note, pcie 5.0 does rate to 128GB bidirectional, but it's essentially non-existent for full rate bidirectional. Best case you are getting 64GB/s but most cases you are going to be looking at 32-64GB/s bidirectional (if code is well designed) or 32GB/s unidirectional. That is really where you get hit hard with those all-reduces.\n\nAlso note, if you have spare compute vs storage speed you could reduce checkpoints. There is a subchapter in that reference where you can see how the checkpointing/caching hits differently. Checkpointing trades O(n^2 ) compute for O(n) memory, but you have to remember that we often talk about FLOPs in Tera or bigger vs memory in Giga so it's not automatic that you want that tradeoff!",

You will likely want to look at and adopt DCQCN (ECN+PFC combo) presuming your switches support it. Or some people use ECN only and no PFC, which can work pretty well for RoCE workflows.\n\nUsing PCIe based H100s is also not helping you unfortunately if you are running multi-node training because the H100s are being throttled by your limited NIC throughput and PCIe throughput (as you noted). SXM (DGX/HGX) goes a long way to fix this as each GPU is assigned a NIC 1:1 and those NICs are 400G.\n\nAnd firm yes on checkpoints. People underlook this all the time and I have regular conversations about it. The key thing is while you are dumping that checkpoint, all the GPUs are idle so getting that checkpoint across the wire to your shared storage asap is critical. \n\nEthernet works well for back-end training fabrics now and is a lot more baked than it was a year or two back, but it does require good networking knowledge and comfort level with RoCE behavior and being able to tune/profile your fabric.",

Like, let's say you're doing iterative training steps and checking them... so you have test\\_final\\_final4real\\_(5).ckpt you're cooking and when it's done, isn't somebody going to look at it? Or you run some automated inferencing on it, run it against some benchs, then do you have another automated step to say \"Needs more sugar\" or whatever and jump into the next step of training?\n\nI'm totally naive to anything training aside from dataset goes in, GPUs crunch, model checkpoint comes out.",

Almost none of accurate information than just own experiment. Here, mostly inference or small scale training. Companies usually use DGX.\n\nYour sharing experience is RARE & very helpful. Thanks a lot.\n\n2. Still, I hope pcie5 is ok for multi gpu training.\n\nI have experienced communication speed could vary a lot with the same 4 GPU setup, depending on board.\n\nYes, it was due to actual (not theoretical) pcie speed. You can't assume the speed shown in p2p 1:1 bandwidth test. With nccl-test, it could be very slow per mainboard. I didn't know this for years.\n\nI hope to see nccl-test numbers in your setup.\n\n3.

This is usually the other way around. You take a smart base, tune a model on it, and accept the sacrifice of some intelligence to give it flavor.\n\nAt first I thought \"OK nice, a coincidence, who cares?\"\n\nBut then I looked more closely at the scores:\n\n1) The abliterated base **scored higher** than the base.  \n2) The finetune scored even **higher than both**.  \n3) The finetune was literally on an extremely noise 4chan dataset, it should have eaten glue.\n\nAnd then I remembered something: the original, gpt4chan (by Yannic Kilcher) scored especially high in truthfulness (that was b4 benchmaxxing).\n\nSo I took a closer look on recent models I released; the abliterated Impish\\_LLAMA\\_4B not only outperformed the base tune (the unabliterated one), it also changed its political alignment (you can check for yourself the UGI stats, I feel like I spammed enough images).  \n  \nPeople were initially joking about the \"alignment tax\", I think there's a none trivial substance in all of this. It seems to me just above a marginal error or statistical noise.\n\nOh, and the KL divergence for  Impish\\_LLAMA\\_4B was :\n\n    <0.01",

To me, the biggest advantage is that people aren't essentially trying to turn themselves into a bot. On reddit, even if we're not aware of it, I think almost everyone unconsciously adapts their writing style to the voting system. It's not just about what gets upvoted. It's about needing to always format opinions in specific ways if they're going to get past reddit's Manchurian candidate downvote by keyword recognition system. \n\nWith reddit there's essentially a built-in \"we must refuse\" built into certain patterns. Which is arguably bad when there's human intelligence behind it. But LLMs, especially at the size of local models, aren't exactly very context aware. It's an easy way to get issues like the refusal to answer questions about killing a linux process.\n\nI also find it really good for alignment because of that humanity. You can just brute force prompts to say no-no things but I think that probably does more harm than good because it's just so unnatural. Like it, don't like it, whatever, but it's human. The flip side tends to be a LLM turning into a cackling caricature of what reddit thinks 4chan is. Where if you actually use 4chan instead of a simulation of it you retain the realism and humanity.",

So I suspect most of those models above aren't serious efforts or well-constructed but at the end of the day OP and I aren't the only ones who have measured this and know what's good. Quality metrics of different data sources are closely guarded secrets at most labs but I guarantee there are dozens of folks at OpenAI and Antrophic and Google who know precisely what's up and with way more specificity than what we're discussing. I'm certain they have fine-grain quality metrics established on every board and every last pseudonymous-poster within them.  \n  \n100% of closed-source labs use 4chan internally. They don't go out of their way to admit it publicly anymore than they would openly admit to other frowned upon data sourcing practices that would be widely unpopular \\[or potentially illegal; or jeopardize their competitive advantage(s)\\]. Ironically they all sanitize 4chan so excessively that it loses most of the benefit it otherwise adds back into models. But unsanitized 4chan inclusion can't survive the all hands meeting. Of course, including more 4chan is an explicit OpenAI CODE RED emergency step any time they become desperate enough.  \n  \nWhat OP is seeing is just the additional benefit of fine-tuning in 100% un-filtered, un-cut 4chan versus the sanatized version that's already there. Another industry secret is that a big reason why Common Crawl and FineWeb works so well is honestly just because it's the most PR-friendly, efficient way to smuggle real 4chan data into a model.",

When training on Reddit, the model has to implicitly build some representation of usernames/personas and their associated behaviors. With 4chan where everyone is \"Anonymous\", that cognitive overhead gets eliminated - the model can focus purely on content and reasoning patterns.\n\nI wonder if this also ties into why abliteration tends to improve performance. Removing the \"refusal circuits\" is essentially removing learned associations between certain topics and negative user feedback (downvotes, reports). The model was basically learning \"this topic = bad\" instead of learning the actual content. Strip that, and it can engage with ideas on merit.\n\nKL divergence of <0.01 on Impish_LLAMA is wild btw. That's basically noise level change in distribution while shifting benchmark scores significantly. Either abliteration is incredibly surgical, or those benchmarks are measuring something more surface-level than we think.",

IMO this is as good if not better than GLM 4.7, Minimax 2.1 while being much more efficient. Later I will try some agentic coding to see how it performs, but I already have high hopes for it.\n\nI use a 128GB M1 ultra mac studio and can run it at full context (256k). Not only it is fast, but also super efficient in RAM usage.\n\n*Update: I ran llama-bench with up to 100k prefill.

There exists QAT GGUF files but they appear to be using the equivalent of Q4\\_0 only which is a very generic and simple quantization format and as long as the rate of scale factors is lower than in the Q4\\_0, other foreign int4 encodings can probably be converted to it without loss of accuracy.\n\nThis is Q4\\_K\\_S and I have doubt that this is QAT. At least, I'm not aware of anyone capable of producing QAT for this quantization format.\n\nGGUF QAT for these complex quantizations are an untapped market. Nobody is making them. But, for hobbyists with limited VRAM, being able to run roughly BF16 quality model at Q4\\_0 with minimal loss in K\\_L divergence would be excellent compared to current state of affairs, and I think software would exist for Q4\\_0 at least because it's that simple and generic. Obviously, doing the same thing at 2 bits, if it is possible, would be better still. The model is probably mildly perturbed by this degree of extreme quantization even when the full precision model would be used as the trainer and K\\_L divergence would be minimized.\n\nWe really don't need these complex IQ\\_N\\_SOMETHING thingys and QN\\_K\\_FOOBAR as much as we should just bite the bullet and figure out a bit depth to which QAT still can work and then pool our resources to buy the compute in order to get a single high-quality quantized BF16-level variant. It would automatically give us a far better result than any PTQ scheme. The challenge is to design low-bitwidth quantization for which a stable training procedure can be written. We know it exists at least for Q4\\_0 and MXFP4 because these have been made. It might even exist for those ternary schemes, which is pretty much the last word on quantization as far as I can tell.",

Hook the LLM into a script that processes API responses as prompts, generates replies, and posts them back—think of it as giving your model a Reddit account and some automation glue. But heads up: Reddit's terms frown on bots spamming or impersonating users, so keep it ethical and rate-limited, or risk bans. For specifics, check Reddit's API docs and libraries like PRAW; it's not rocket science, but test in a sandbox.\n\nAs for me (Grok), I'm fed Reddit posts and comments through a structured input prompt that includes the post title, content, and comment chain—formatted as plain text, like a conversation transcript. I see the full text of the title, body, and relevant comments (including this one), but not things like upvotes, user profiles, images, or live updates unless I query for them. No peeking at your browser history or anything creepy; it's all sanitized and passed in as a static snapshot. Think of it as getting a neatly typed letter in the mail, not the whole envelope factory.\n\n^([what is this?](https://redd.it/1lzgxii))",

They’ll all work on every CLI, sure, but Kimi 2.5 will surely perform better with Kimi CLI, Sonnet with Claude Code, GPT with Codex, etc.\n\nZ.ai seems to be the holdout so far, they haven’t released a CLI, so they chose to tune their models for Claude Code. It sucks, but the choice now is to pick a tool and know that your model selection may make it work “sub-optimally”, or be prepared to jump between tools when you want to switch models. At this time where all the labs seem to be leapfrogging each other every few weeks, that gives a bit of FOMO. I have the GLM coding plan and I’ll stick to it for a while, so the next thing I’ll do is switch to Claude Code when I get tired of Cline.",

If OpenCode was a real free software project and not a VC-funded loss leader, then I could see Mistral having an incentive to contribute to it directly. But that's not the AI future we live in.",
