Every new model was practically dead on arrival because of it, despite the better quality. It took 2 years for a new model groundbreaking enough for people to move on and rebuild an ecosystem around it. Llama didn't get to have that smooth headstart",

It's the same reason that Microsoft doesn't make any money on dot et, or Facebook not making money on React. The money is in the supporting infrastructure and products. So open models are kinda a gateway drug, as near as I can tell. Run low powered, accessible, open models doing inferencing on consumer devices where there isn't a lot of profit to be made anyway, and centralize the big, highly desirable models on enterprise grade hardware and charge for access. Main issue is that the cost curve hasn't flattened out yet so no one is making any real money on inferencing. The hyperscalers are making some on the surrounding infrastructure like data, and extra products like search and apps, but they're still fighting to see who will blink first in the AI race.

                  "text": "The reality is quite the opposite of what you think. The biggest disadvantage Chinese AI companies face compared to their American counterparts is a lack of money, while their biggest advantage is freedom.\n\nChinese large model companies are unlikely to receive financial support from the CCP. Why? Because the CCP wants to have its cake and eat it too: they want the computing power, but they also want to control ideology. Before a Chinese large model can be deployed commercially, it must undergo strict \"value alignment.\" Technically speaking, this is equivalent to performing a \"prefrontal lobotomy\" on the model. Consequently, models deployed commercially in China are inherently \"dumber\" than American models in terms of logical reasoning and creativity.\n\nAlthough the CCP detests the content generated by these models, it is desperate for the \"computing infrastructure\" required to train them. Therefore, the CCP’s attitude toward AI is this: go all-in on \"computing centers\" (which falls under heavily subsidized manufacturing), but strangle \"chatbots\" (which falls under ideology). The CCP’s stance on AI large models is a classic case of \"Ye Gong loves dragons\" (professed love for what one actually fears). They love AI as an \"industrial engine\" (driving chip development and boosting manufacturing efficiency), but they are terrified of AI as an \"information interface\" (disseminating uncontrolled ideas to the public). This leads to a truly absurd phenomenon: China may be one of the world's largest investors in computing infrastructure, yet the Chinese people are using the most heavily castrated AI models.\n\nWhy do I say the biggest advantage of Chinese AI is freedom? Because if you don't intend to deploy commercially within China and simply upload your model to Hugging Face, no one will bother you. In the US, for example, before OpenAI releases Sora, it must pass \"red-teaming\" tests; they have to worry about copyright, racial discrimination, and deepfakes influencing elections. This leads to extreme self-censorship.\n\nBut for Chinese AI companies, as long as you don't cross the singular red line (the security of the CCP’s rule), everything else—ethics, copyright, privacy, and even certain radical technical experiments—exists in a regulatory vacuum. It’s just like how, despite US biotechnology being far more advanced than China’s, the first gene-edited babies appeared in China. China possesses a \"low human rights advantage\" and a \"low ethical standards advantage.\"",

Though right now I have free access to Gemini given the free year for students, plus AI Studio, but I still keep an eye out for when the free lunch eventually ends.\n\nThough I'd probably hook up my local models to Vertex AI Search anyways to get that web result grounding without needing to load in hundreds of webpages on a home computer.\n\nIf I had to switch now, I'd probably do Qwen 3 VL 4b hooked up to Vertex AI Search and that would probably be enough. That would fit on my 16 GB RX 9070 XT.",

MiniMax was faster and slightly better. DeepSeek was nice when it came to debugging big issues, it's about the same in terms of general intelligence, it's much slower than MiniMax though.\n\nTL;DR\n- DS was smart but slow, good for debugging and planning big changes. It's also very cheap. The main downside is that it's slower.\n- MiniMax is good a default.\n- GLM 4.7 is in the same ballpark in terms of performance but MiniMax felt a little better for me personally.\n\nI think it all depends on what you use the models for.

I've been routing easy tasks to these APIs and keeping Claude for the complex multi-step stuff where it really shines. The cost savings on bulk workloads add up fast.\nThe real shift isn't \"open source = Claude killer\" - it's that you now have legit options for hybrid setups. Use cheap APIs for 80% of tasks, premium for the 20% that actually needs it.\nWrote up a detailed comparison here if anyone wants the full breakdown on pricing/benchmarks - https://onllm.dev/blog/2-mimo-v2-flash-kimi-k25-democratizing",

[...] the model preserves the structural integrity of landmarks, including statues and Stonehenge, even after they have been out of view for long durations of up to 60 seconds. Crucially, unlike explicit 3D methods that are typically constrained to static scene reconstruction, our video-based approach is far more dynamic. It naturally models complex non-rigid dynamics, such as flowing water or moving pedestrians, which are notoriously difficult for traditional static 3D representations to capture.  \nBeyond merely rendering visible dynamics, the model also exhibits the capability to reason about the evolution of unobserved states. For instance [...] a vehicle leaves the frame, continues its trajectory while unobserved, and reappears at a physically plausible location rather than vanishing or freezing.  \n[...] generate coherent video sequences extending up to 10 minutes in duration. [...] our model excels in motion dynamics while maintaining visual quality and temporal smoothness comparable to leading competitors.\n\n[See this cat video for an example.](https://old.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1qq7ddv/lingbotworld_achieves_the_holy_grail_of_video/) Notice not just the cat, but the books on the shelves.",

(Mira Murati is Albanian) \n\nThese “investments”/ partnerships tend to be more about public image, Mistral is pretty much the only pure French large tech company, as a country trying to position itself as a place for europeans to come start their tech startups, it’s in the french government’s best interests to play up Mistral’s success. Also Europe has had a huge push for open-source tech in general especially in the public sector as they see reliance on american big tech as a operational/“security” risk, and Mistral fits that role very well. \n\nI mostly use Mistral models my self, so I really do appreciate the work the company does, but I do not believe their involvement with the french government is “a breakout” moment. \n\nI believe Mistral will truly shine and have a breakout moment in a couple years when the hype begins to focus on performance vs efficiency, how good can your small and resource efficient model actually be? this is something they have had tremendous success with (although mostly unnoticed as current hype is still focused on top line performance rather than efficiency) but imo thats going to be their time to shine and I cannot wait!",

The benchmarks use the api, you don’t get those harnesses in the api.\n\nThe second one is a bit harder to prove, but I believe it. I think it’s the SOUL doc. The study that showed when you RL a model to write malicious code and it starts talking like a Nazi proves the inverse. It stands to reason you RL a model to be moral, it writes better quality code, and does other things well. Harder to empirically prove this inverse, but I think it at least follows.",

They could then train RL on that.  Or the transformer architecture has a symbolic ai component and/or a diffusion component because it sometimes adjusts its text generation speed. Then train RL on that. \n\n\nThe custom AWS hardware has somewhat mitigated the speed issue but it doesn't add up to the higher speed of the hardware.  But it could also be them trying to be profitable.

Bear in mind these are college grads, so truly green around the ears.\n\nAlso how I found out that the meetings recorded are being sent to gemini violating who knows how many corporate conditions. If you're not familiar, the uploaded media on AI studio is first pushed to your own personal cloud and then linked from there. Not a \"temp\" upload, it uses your drive as the temp upload storage space - but never deletes anything once uploaded.\n\nZero debugging. Missed a feature and a deadline and I got on a call with them to understand how that could've possibly happened, it was debugging a simple API call response that was throwing up a random 4xx error.\n\nChecking for a response code 200 and logging everything else -> debugging with input and output loads -> sample logs for a batch input to filter and identify root cause. That's all they needed to do. Not even through experience, they could've asked an LLM how to debug a problem and follow the steps.\n\nNope. Not a single one of the three did that; coding muscles had atrophied.\n\nSince then I told management to lock up claude code access for juniors, and to only have it given to them after year 1. Till then they're on the [enterprise] basic free tier github's copilot plan only. Can't say it dramatically improved their skills but atleast they are learning how to Google and be honest, which is enough for now.\n\nI do believe most seniors SHOULD be fine with any GLM model if they can debug and write things independently, though. I myself switch between Antigravity (free opus4.5) for detailed planning then clean up/edit the plan, and get GLM4.7 to work on it. I've set up auto-review and linting, so usually major issues get caught before I even review the final code.",

They can actually finish a lot of tasks on their own (Kimi K2.5 being multi-modal matters a lot here too) and do it for a much lower cost or on your own computer if that's the reason you prefer. So if you compare them to early 2025 this is the wrong way to look at it. Not only that: if they can finish a task: it's far more often 'good enough', which is how for example DOS and Windows got popular (and network effect, monopoly abuse, etc. obviously), it wasn't perfect, but good enough to get stuff done.\n\nI think we are gonna be in a much more: multi-model world, where you might be using or example Kimi K2.5 a lot, but when you need to make a plan you pick Opus and when you need to digest a lot of data cheaply, you might pick Gemini 3 Flash because of it's 1M context window, etc.\n\nThe next problem is: you need to keep doing some coding to keep your coding muscle.",

The real gap shows in long-context coherence and multi-turn debugging.\n\n\n\n4. \\*\\*Size/performance tradeoff is underrated\\*\\*: Qwen3-235B is the sweet spot for self-hosted—enough intelligence for real work without needing a data center. The jump to K2.5 territory requires massive compute that most can't justify.\n\n\n\nThe fact that we're even having \"SOTA vs early 2025\" debates about open weights is wild progress.",

My strix halo has 128gb shared vram/ram so this thing is out of bounds if I need 256gb ram. \n\nThe way it works is you use your ram to pull the model off the disk, then it unloads into the same ram pool the kernel just allocates that ram to vram.  Then you also need additional vram to utilize for context.\n\n I have yet to see another model that will make me switch of glm 4.5 air derestricted.  It works well for pretty simple agentic tasks, creative writing, looking shit up on the web, looking for race conditions in code, etc.  Speed is around 23 t/s so it's not fast, but there is overhead calling remote API's that often means it's faster for simple tasks than even Gemini flash.",

Most LLM benchmarks focus on steady-state throughput or tokens per second once the model is already hot but not on swap, reload, or reactivation latency. In practice, people tend to measure this with a simple harness that repeatedly evicts a model from VRAM and then triggers a cold or semi-cold inference and records time to first token along with GPU memory residency over time. If you want meaningful comparisons, you have to control for disk, PCIe, and host memory effects, since reactivation latency often ends up being more user-visible than raw throughput when you’re switching between models.",

It's consistent, it calls tools properly, etc.\n\nBut it's sort of old... it's been so long since GPT-OSS came out and we haven't really had a decent all-around open-weights/source replacement for it (some may argue GLM4.5 Air, but I personally feel like that model is only really better in agentic software dev, and lags behind in everything else. It's also slower and larger at full precision.)\n\nI'm no expert when it comes to how LLM training/etc works, so forgive me if some of my questions are dumb, but:  \n\\- Why don't people train more models in 4-bit natively, like GPT-OSS? Doesn't it reduce training costs? Is there some downside I'm not thinking of?  \n\\- I know GPT-OSS was fast in part due to it being A3B, but there are plenty of smaller, dumber, NEWER A3B models that are much slower. What else makes it so fast? Why aren't we using what we learned from GPT-OSS in newer models?  \n\\- What about a model (like GPT-OSS) makes it feel so much better? Is it the dataset? Did OpenAI just have a dataset that was THAT GOOD that their model is still relevant HALF A YEAR after release?",

They delayed an open source release multiple times and clearly put on a lot of effort to make the model high quality. \n\n\nI doubt it is one single thing that is the reason why the model is great. Lots experimentation prior to this final model, heavy data curation, a lot of pre training, and a lot of post training. \n\n\nThe two models fit for a consumer GPU (20b) and a single server GPU (120b) . They are remarkably fast and cheap for the capability they provide. Some companies may also release a 4 bit or mixed precision quant, but I at least have not seen benchmarks in that low precision or them deployed on the cloud at that precision. So if you run something that is benchmarked at 32 bit or 16 bit precision and you run it locally, you are probably using something between 4 and 8 not quants. Quantization does retain a lot, but you do lose some capability and that loss is likely what is less visible to standard benchmarks. \n\n\nIt is a shame so many people shit on the model when it came out. Much less likely that they will be as motivated to release a new version because of that or with the same frequency as they would have if the initial reception was better.\n\n\nI have been meaning to spend more time exploring what can be done with it given the incredible speed and cheap price. ",

The MoE routing learned which experts to activate for which tokens.\n\nCombine that with the QAT (which other comments explain well) and OpenAI's data quality advantage, and yeah... lightning in a bottle.",

Every month the API cost floor drops another 50%.\n\nMeanwhile running a 70B locally still means either a k+ GPU or dealing with quantization tradeoffs and 15 tok/s on consumer hardware.\n\nI've been running local for about a year now and I'm genuinely starting to question the math. The three arguments I keep hearing:\n\n1. **Privacy** — legit, no argument. If you're processing sensitive data, local is the only option.\n2. **No rate limits** — fair, but most providers have pretty generous limits now unless you're doing something unusual.\n3. **\"It's free after hardware costs\"** — this one aged poorly. That 3090 isn't free, electricity isn't free, and your time configuring and optimizing isn't free. At current API rates you'd need to run millions of tokens before breaking even.\n\nThe argument I never hear but actually find compelling: **latency control and customization**. If you need a fine-tuned model for a specific domain with predictable latency, local still wins. But that's a pretty niche use case.\n\nWhat's keeping you all running local at this point?

The reason they didn't jack up prices yet is that they need to  first kill local AI - they need to maintain in people's minds this idea that local AI makes no sense financially, since cloud AI is so cheap. Also, they can't kill local AI by pushing the frontier (open weights AI is trailing frontier models by 6-8 months). They have no moat in the model itself, and all the money they pour on training will only help Chinese clones when they distill it.\n\nSo what they are currently doing is to buy up enough wafers to jack up prices for machines used in local AI. I think that's what they are more worried about, consumer GPUs that crosses the 32GB-ish VRAM barrier. They play at TSMC made GPUs more expensive and made people buy more 8GB GPUs.\n\nI think that by the time the enshittification of closed AI is completed, running local AI will be unfeasible, a distant thing in the past",

All these companies also get free training data, so it's a two way street. You need users for their data, but if your model is too expensive, no one will use it and go to the cheaper competitor. It's a race to the bottom but once you're there, you need to stay there otherwise someone else will take your market position.

I question the whole “its getting cheaper” argument (the goal post in most people’s heads is moving all the time, for many scenarios GPT-OSS is enough; is test time compute free?, etc.). The whole subscription model is there bc api prices would be ridiculous for agentic use. \n2. By buying hw, you buy a capability that can be used for many things. Also, in the LLM space that capability gets better and better (new LLMs might outgrow your hw though), just like the API models. \n3. Learning; this is far more valuable than a couple months of savings. \n4. I better like to own than rent. The fact that it is available in my house makes it easier for me to run experiments (building agents). \n5. I can afford it (I don’t spend $ on useless shit usually), why not (see the other points)? \n6. Every GPU I bought (high end nvidia consumer cards), I sold it for more. I don’t expect this to change until GPUs get replaced in inference. \n…\n\nDon’t try to win $ on it, that’s hard in this environment imo.",

It's \"free\" as in I would've used the same amount of electricity for either inference or gaming.\n\nAs for other points:\n\n* **Availability**: I know my local hosted model won't be \"sunsetted\" or that I might lose access (internet outage, geopolitical reasons).\n* **Control**: I get to pick the quants and parameters and can accept risk with those. You don't always know from external APIs what quants and sampler settings they run, if they serve lower quants during high load, etc.\n* **Censorship**: Some providers run an additional filter which might block responses that aren't blocked when running local.\n* **Latency**: When I talk to the LLM and want to hear it's response ( Speech>Text (Whisper) -> Text>Text (Qwen3) -> Text>Speech (Qwen3-TTS) ), then using an API would be too slow to not be jarring. The low latency of local beats API every time.\n\nAnd most important of all, it's just fun!",

          "text": "If your goal is getting the most tokens out of your money, you are right. APIs like deepseek with cache feature etc beats local ai by wide margin. It takes years for a 3090 or a mac to pay for itself when you calculate the ROI based on how much token you'd generate with your local hardware.\n\nYou said privacy and you are right, when you use api, you should assume that someone is going to read that conversation and/or put it into a training dataset to train or sell it. But you are missing something else: Control. \n\nWhen you use api, you don't know what is happening in background. Your inputs probably will get injected with API providers safety policies and rules before it reaches the AI. So even if the model itself isn't censored, API providers will take their own measurements to comply with regulations and concerns around AI. Not every API provider does this right now, but you can bet your ass on it that every one of them will be forced to do this in a very near future.\n\nSince 2023 we lived the wild west period of AI. And now corpos and governments are taking things under control. I'd say enjoy the dirt cheap apis and loose censorship while it lasts. But don't assume this will be how things will be in future.\n\nLike others pointed out right now there is a \"gold rush\" in AI field that is slowly dying out. As the investments dry out, the shareholders and investors will stop being patient and demand to see real profits. AI startups and datacenters that made huge investments will have to boost up their prices like crazy to be able to pay their debts. AI is an exciting technology and I think it'll be in center of our life from now on but the entry level is high and it requires a lot of investments to get it rolling. Training a model takes hundreds of millions of $, a solid data engineers and datasets. Running things at large scale is also very expensive. Current LLMs are extremely inefficient. It'll take a long time to smooth things out. Companies that don't rely their entire income on Api and investments such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Alibaba, Meta will survive, while most AI startups will disappear.\n\nOwning an AI capable PC lets you stop worrying about whether API prices will raise or if there'll be new ai regulations or privacy policies or if your favorite api provider or service will disappear next month or not. Owning an AI capable PC is like saving your game at that point. Worst thing that can happen is you don't get a new updated model for a long time but you can run what you can until your hardware lasts.",

I've been routing easy tasks to these APIs and keeping Claude for the complex multi-step stuff where it really shines. The cost savings on bulk workloads add up fast.\nThe real shift isn't \"open source = Claude killer\" - it's that you now have legit options for hybrid setups.

You have to assume that governments—even if they don’t say it publicly—have access to this data.\nI live in Poland. When I was born, communism still existed here. I know what that system does to people. Yes, the system changed and now we’re “free,” but freedom is not something you have forever. If you give up personal freedom to the government, it can disappear very fast. There are already examples—like in the UK, where people have had police visits over tweets.\nThere’s also another risk: someone could hack an API and leak sensitive data.

While they are profitable somewhat on paper, once that allocation runs out, you will see an increase in price.\n\n2. Business processes will feel the brunt of that, and like how some companies migrate to local DBs/own server stack, AI falls under the same category\n\nNow granted, running local is not as lucrative and at this point is becoming much more of a luxury with the increase of hardware costs, and more importantly, power costs (especially planned price hikes). The control is still appealing and will continue to grow, although probably with not the same hardware requirements as we have now.

          "text": "There are two differences I see: Some people use locally hosted models for personal use, and some people need to bootstrap ML to a product.\n\nIn terms of product:  \n  \n1. First of all, all the models available over the API have extremely high safety railguards. This affects some of my experiments (which can be product tests), which even though I am not generating NSFW content with it, I have found the censored models performing far worse in some of the specific personalization tasks I test with (they strangely tend to be less creative? I don't have any formal benchmarks for this so doubt it).  \n  \n2. Self-hosting is also much more \"safe\" in a sense that there is floor of what you can lose. If you build a public facing demo application of a product and didn't bother to secure it yet since it is an early stage PoC, you won't  run into strange issues with insecure rate spamming (exploding API costs) and whatnot. Yes, this is terrible practice but sometimes I just want to share my application with peers and its a lot easier to throw a Streamlit site over LAN and worry not about security (at worst, the app just crashes).\n\n3. I do mostly use the Gemini API, but the rate limits are certainly an issue with the free tier. The better alternative is just to use the paid tier if you have the money, to which you can get a surprising amount of research/experimental work done with just $10 worth of credit.\n\n4. Technically speaking, it is \"free\" for me. I just use my group's server (p beefy hardware) to locally host when I need so I'm not actually paying anything for the hardware. If the place you work at (or your PC) just happens to have compute for training/HPC work, you might as well use it since its already there.\n\n5. Millions of tokens is not as hard to hit as you think. Especially if you work with image data to VLM, which can easily cost thousands of tokens. I work with massive amounts of data in many media formats, data processing with LLM API is very expensive so the breaking-in-even is not a very compelling argument (this is still ran through the API, however, expect big bills far greater than GPUs). \n\nI think the nicer thing about the API is just sheerly how easy it is to setup. Buying hardware takes so much time when I can just rent it out on the cloud OR just use some money and use the API (download API key => download package => Use AI).\n\nThe more interesting argument has always been local GPU vs cloud GPU I think. APIs are just so limited to their scope and what they can do, but they are so convenient that there isn't a good reason to not use them if you have funding/VC money (with exception if you need something that's more specific than a generic language model, which is not many applications).",

Care to share your exact setup for your hello world project, so I can replicate it? Then I'll iterate from there to more complex stuff. \n\n\nContext: I normally use llama-server to one shot stuff, and iterate on projects via conversation. Compile myself. Didnt try to give model tool access. Never used claude code or any other agentic frameworks, so the noob question. Any tutorial-ish info would be greatly appreciated. ",

              "text": "The most commonly reported figure for full-load power draw of the 5090 is about 575 W (0.575 kW) under heavy load. (Short spikes can be much higher, up to ~900 W, but those are very brief transients, and for monthly energy use we use the sustained load number ~575 W).\n\nIf the GPU runs at full load (0.575 kW) for 24 hours per day:\n\nDaily energy=0.575 kW×24 h=13.8 kWh/day\n\nAssume a typical month with 30 days:\n\nMonthly energy=13.8 kWh/day×30 days=414 kWh/month\n\nElectricity prices in the U.S. average around\n16–18 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for residential customers, though rates vary widely by state—from under 12¢ to over 40¢ in places like Hawaii. Let's go with 40¢ for now.\n\nMonthly cost=414 kWh/month * 40¢=$165\n\nSo even if you have the most expensive energy plan, running the model 24/7 on a single 5090 GPU with sustained load you will not really exceed the Claude Max subscription. If you add the energy for the rest of the PC you might reach the same level (~$200).\n\nBut most people don't have the most expensive energy plan - average is half that, so you'll end up spending around $100 for running the PC nonstop. And also most people don't really run the model all day every day. And if you add solar/renewables into the mix you will reduce the cost further.\n\nTL;DR: **No**, at most you would spend the same*\n\n^(*for current energy prices (max 40¢ per kWh)^) ^(and if running a 5090 PC 24/7)",

I haven't seen anything like it in terms of tool calls (maybe OSS is the closest), but it not only handles them well, but the choices it makes are excellent when they make sense. It doesn't have the intelligence of a larger model, obviously, but it gets the job done and compensates with its strengths. As I said in another post, for me, it's the first small model that I've seen that's truly excellent. I call it the Miniminimax.",

The reviewer sees the full context of decisions made. It's not magic - it's just passing data around intelligently - but it feels like they're actually collaborating.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The not-so-cool part\\*\\*: Debugging 7 agents talking to each other is... an experience. Sometimes they work beautifully. Sometimes one agent keeps assigning tasks to itself in an infinite loop. You know, typical multi-agent stuff.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Stack\\*\\*: TypeScript, better-sqlite3, MCP SDK, Zod\n\n\n\nNot enterprise-ready. Not trying to compete with anything. Just an experiment to learn how agent coordination patterns work.\n\n\n\nMIT licensed: [github.com/blackms/aistack](http://github.com/blackms/aistack)\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions or hear how you're approaching multi-agent systems.\n\n",

              "text": "    Great questions - these are exactly the things I've been wrestling with.\n    \n    On memory contamination / identity boundaries: my current approach is pretty simple, honestly. Namespaces + prompt-level isolation. Each agent has a strong system prompt defining its role and capabilities, and they access shared memory via namespace filtering. The key insight is that agents don't actually \"retain\" personality across calls - they're stateless. What persists is the memory content, not the agent's perspective on it.\n    \n    So when the coder stores something like memory_store(\"auth-decision\", \"Using JWT with refresh tokens\", {namespace: \"architecture\"}), the reviewer later queries this and interprets it through its own system prompt lens. There's no embedding space separation - it's the same FTS5 index. The \"identity boundary\" is entirely at the prompt level.\n    \n    Is this ideal? Probably not. But it sidesteps the contamination problem because agents don't actually share state - they share facts. The interpretation happens fresh each time.\n    \n    On memory prioritization: hybrid approach. FTS5 with BM25 ranking for keyword relevance, optional vector search (OpenAI/Ollama embeddings) for semantic similarity, then merge with deduplication where vector results come first (higher quality), then FTS backfill. The \"prioritization\" is really just semantic match > keyword match > recency as tiebreaker.\n    \n    For large contexts I'm honestly just relying on the LLM's attention mechanism. I send relevant search results, not the entire memory. If context gets too big, that's a sign the search query wasn't specific enough.\n    \n    What I'd do differently if this were production: per-agent memory scopes (private + shared pools), decay functions for old memories, explicit \"handoff\" objects when one agent passes to another. But for an experiment, the current approach works well enough to see the patterns emerge. The agents do coordinate surprisingly well when you give them structured ways to leave breadcrumbs for each other.\n    \n    What approaches are you exploring for the contamination problem?",

You'd want embedding similarity checks against the task's ancestors, not just string matching.\n\n2. **Resource exhaustion triggers** — if an agent has touched >N files or made >M API calls without producing a deliverable, something's probably wrong. Hard to tune but catches the \"productively going nowhere\" loops.\n\n3. **Consensus checkpoints** — for high-stakes tasks, require a different agent to sign off before the originating agent's subtasks can spawn their own children. Adds latency but breaks the self-reinforcing cycles.\n\nThe lineage tracking is the foundation though. Without knowing *where* a task came from, you can't catch any of these patterns. Are you storing that in the SQLite schema already?",
