There is no fine tuning, no modern data, and for now no instruction or Q&A pairs so the model continues text from a prompt. This model is 1.2B parameters and uses a 90GB dataset consisting of books, journals, legal docs, religious writing, medical papers, etc. I also use a custom tokenizer, trained on the dataset itself and the model has been trained for 182k steps so far on a rented H100 SXM.\n\nExample outputs:\n\n[Even though the prompt only mentions a specific year, the model generates an argument against the Roman Catholic Church. The dataset does contain large amounts of religious and political writing and the Catholic Emancipation Act took place in 1829 so this behavior makes sense.](https://preview.redd.it/l0oaulxrascg1.png?width=1478&format=png&auto=webp&s=5292309afa4c4735471542b6cc794f6538b42486)\n\n[The telephone was invented in 1876 \\(dataset cuts off at 1875\\), so the model is unfamiliar with the term, treating it as some kind of secret\\/diplomatic device or thing.](https://preview.redd.it/tvem9mxrascg1.png?width=1484&format=png&auto=webp&s=347a6b3242b8ecb97a515196109eb63cc146bae0)\n\nFor next steps, I'm going to look into creating some kind of synthetic Q&A pairs using the dataset itself.\n\n[https://github.com/haykgrigo3/TimeCapsuleLLM](https://github.com/haykgrigo3/TimeCapsuleLLM)\n\n[https://huggingface.co/haykgrigorian/TimeCapsuleLLM-v2-1800-1875](https://huggingface.co/haykgrigorian/TimeCapsuleLLM-v2-1800-1875)",

The “AI” has none of these things. It’s a function approximator. The inclusion of self-aware-sounding chats in the training data is a shrewd decision because it allows users to chat “with” the “AI” as though it has its own theory of mind, self awareness, or subjective viewpoint, and VC money goes gaga for this. So it’s a very lucrative bit of deception.\n\nIn fact the entirety of the instruct fine tuning paradigm is based on a similar but subtler deception. The model is never “answering” anything, it’s only completing/continuing the prompt. It just happens that the completion looks like an answer, because the tuning dataset was all prompts followed by answers.\n\nInstruct models are convenient, but base models are where you get to see how the sausage is made (“base model” is coming to mean something else these days; I’m using it in its original sense meaning “pretrained” i.e. not (yet) instruct fine tuned).",

Transformers is already showing its limits. The problem is that most companies prefer to feed more/better data to the actual models to improve them. It seems like in the 80s where chess programs were getting better because computers were getting faster and because they operated using brute force.\n\nSame goes for movies and tv series: it's less risky to do a reboot or sequel than a brand new movie or series.",

It also spends ton of tokens on questioning rules. Didn't try it for creative writing but then again with its smaller context window and the lack of world knowledge (similar issue with Qwen) it might not work well for that.  \n(also smaller MoEs suck in general (like that 20B one), better to just take the slower dense model, than deal with faster slop that feels like a much smaller model)",

          "text": "My guesses:\n\n* new GPT-OSS:  I'm not sure.  My working hypothesis is that OpenAI only released GPT-OSS because they thought it would generate buzz among the investors they continue to rely upon to keep the doors open.  They might release another one if Altman thinks it will keep investors' money flowing.\n\n* Gemma4:  I think so, yes.  I really hope so.  Google seems committed to this path.\n\n* Qwen4:  I suspect we will see this in 2026.  I think the motivations which led to Qwen3 are still in play.\n\n* GLM Air:  Not sure.  It depend on whether ZAI can repeat their success with GLM-4.5-Air, and produce an Air model which outperforms 4.5-Air.  The fact they haven't yet with 4.6 or 4.7 suggests to me they are having trouble doing so.  Perhaps GLM-5 will prove more fertile ground for this?  We will see.\n\n* Llama-5:  Looking dubious.  I hoped that earlier statements from Meta employees about future Llama models staying closed were just talk-talk, but it's increasingly looking like they are headed in that direction.\n\n* Mistral-midsized:  Also not sure.  I'm having trouble figuring out what motivates MistralAI, and what they are trying to accomplish with their open-weight models.  That makes predicting them problematic.  **Edited to add:** Saw this article today -- https://www.businessinsider.com/europe-ai-startup-mistral-edge-over-silicon-valley-not-american-2026-1 -- and it sheds a little light on what MistralAI is up to.  If what the article says is true, I suppose we might see an intermediate-sized MistralAI model if their market analysis indicates there are enough paying customers who need something larger than 24B but are unwilling to spring for the hardware needed to host 123B.  Unfortunately I have no way of assessing that.\n\n* Deepseek smaller than 200B:  Probably not.  Deepseek seems to have found their niche in the \"embarrass the West with huge ChatGPT-killing open weight models\", and I expect them to continue focusing their attention on that.\n\n* Affordable GPU larger than 32GB:  I wish!  But probably not.  MI60 (32GB) are affordable now, but the next step up from it is MI210 (64GB), which had dipped below $4000 briefly, but is now priced between $4500 and $5000 again, a situation I don't expect to change much until at least 2027.  Possibly someone (who?) will come out with a new inexpensive GPU product with a huge memory and a lower price tag than used MI210, but I don't see that being a lucrative niche any business would willingly pursue.  It would be very nice to be proven wrong!\n\n* Phi-5:  You didn't mention this one, but I expect Microsoft to come out with it in 2026, though perhaps not until after the several ongoing court cases challenging LLMs' legality have concluded.\n\nWe will see how it goes :-)\n\nRemindMe! 1 year",

It was censored, extremely limited domain applicability, didn't offer the original BF16/FP16 weights for finetuning, didn't provide a base model, etc. I would prefer that we not get a new one. Knowing that is my preference, it is unfortunately likely that we will get one.\n\n\nGemma 4 is pretty probable, but will likely look different to previous generations. It's tough to say exactly what it'll look like, but it'll probably be sparse, if nothing else. If you look at Gemma 3N, we could see some sort of hybrid between that and Deepseek's new Engram architecture, maybe occupying the space we saw in GLM 4.5 Air (a mid/small sized MoE).\n\n\nQwen 4 is pretty likely. Chinese companies are compute constrained by inference and probably almost want to free up inference capacity for training, so it still makes rational self interest sense to release open models.\n\n\nLlama 5 is incredibly unlikely. I'd really like Meta to come back and iterate on local models, and I feel that Llama 4 could have been improved on and succeeded with just a bit of iteration, but Meta's gutted their AI team, and they seem to be focusing on big API models now, with a new team that doesn't support open source.\n\n\nMistral seems to have a really awkward space of model releases. They need to keep some models back from the public to make sure they can make money, so they seem to prefer releasing models in a size that is good enough for local (sub 24B), not enough for small businesses (32B+), but also provide open source models to get buy-in from large corporations (100B+). They're not really interested in ~70B class dense LLMs for consumers because not a lot of consumers have hardware in that range and the hit to their product strategy is bigger than the benefit they get from open source. I could also see them doing something like a GLM 4.5 Air class MoE model instead of a new dense model, but it's tough to say. A real successor to Mistral Nemo 12B would be really nice, though.\n\n\nDeepseek doesn't have any interest in pursuing sub 200B models for any reason, unless maybe it was dense and outperformed their MoE models somehow. That seems unlikely, given their Engram architecture release, though. I'm pretty sure we'll see a possibly bigger than V3 sized model with better long context efficiency/performance.\n\n\nGLM is probably done with the \"Air\" class of model (more than a small local model, less than an API model), and may continue with smaller prototype models (ie: 30B and under class). I expect their next mainline model to be about 500B MoE, but it's tough to say.\n\n\nIn terms of hardware, I imagine we won't see any improvements in 2026, just a slow reduction in price as the price shock from the crazy DRAM deal of 2025 gets eaten away. A lot of enterprises already secured their RAM upgrades, and they upgrade in cycles, which means they didn't \"increase investment\", but rather \"moved investment up by a few years\", so we should see reduced demand for DRAM based products in 2026 from enterprise, which will cause a slow trickle decrease in hardware costs throughout the year. Once costs stabilize towards the end of 2026, to mid 2027, I think we'll start seeing consumer hardware releases at decent scale.\n\n\nI *don't* think that means we'll see an affordable consumer GPU with more than 32GB, unless the rumors of an AMD LPDDR5/6/x GPU coming out are true, but if it does release, it'll be slower than you'd expect, and also not have CUDA\n.\nI *do* think we'll start seeing really impressive APU products, including a followup to Strix Halo from AMD, a Strix Halo competitor from Intel, an improved unified arch from Apple (rumors are 2TB / 2TB/s bandwidth for the top. Will be expensive though), and we'll likely see other players introduce impressive workstation APUs like possibly Qualcomm, too. Even Rockchip is kind of getting into the game and I believe their upcoming SoCs for the year are sort of like an improved Strix Point or Strix Halo-lite.\n\n\nIncluded in these APU products are NPUs, which will see more support coming up, and which offset the lack of a discrete GPU; they cover situations CPUs are poor at (high compute scenarios), and it's possible that Diffusion LLMs or speculative decoding head research may finally see us move from bandwidth bound to compute bound, which may offer a more affordable solution to consumers than traditional GPUs.\n\n\nSo maybe less \"we see an affordable GPU\", and more \"hardware in general gets affordable to those in the know towards mid 2027\".\n\n\nIn general, I think 2026 will be a slow year in hardware, but a crazy year in software advancements as a lot of technologies mature, and we see diversification in model architectures for different scenarios, many of those efforts being led by the community.",

This is a fundamental issue since around 2014 or so that compute has been cheaper than bandwidth to add.\n\nYou can actually test this directly. If you run vLLM backed on a CPU, you can get more total tokens per second with multiple requests than in a single request (these extra requests require extra compute!).\n\nSo, if you compare same-model to same model, a Diffusion LLM denoises multiple tokens per forward pass, which actually does offset the increased compute cost somewhat.\n\nBut you mixed the crux of my argument:\n\nMy argument that compute-bound is preferable is that it's way cheaper to add extra NPU TOPs than it is to add bandwidth to a chip. An NPU with \\~200 TOPs is way cheaper than an extra device that adds 100GB/s of bandwidth, for example, just fundamentally due to how these things scale.",

Absolutely tons. \n\nMaybe we're moving back from fluffy-llms to a rigid structure again (with the benefits of both). \n\nI dont know if a gpu can run zillions of independant \"software\" on a problem, but if it can, that might be crackers effective. \n\nThink diffusion model, but \"made with logic\". \n\nThis is all blue-sky, but my message is - \"things are changing... FAST\" ... \"you might want to realise that the _old way_ (with ai/nn) might have just been a phase.\n\nWhich is my way of hoping i dont have to spent any money on hardware for at least a few years....... \n\nTo use less woo-woo language\n- llms dont need to use human language or code - it can be massively simplified - making far more effecient (deeper!) models.\n- massive pre-work can be done by actual software (insanely fast) not the insanely demanding Neural Net stuff.\n\nTo try to hammer home the message.. something like toy story (the movie) was done with SOFTWARE. I don't know the details, but I'd be surprised if it couldn't be rendered easily on modern hardware. But software also made tons of other stuff.

The model load uses about **1.1 GB of RAM** (not VRAM)\n2. It’s really fast on my Ryzen **5950X**. After the model+voice file load, time to first audio is around **200 ms**, as stated on their website. It could easily be kept loaded in the background and used on the CPU for various tasks (LLM responses, reading summaries or notifications, etc.\n3. As context fills up, RAM usage grows (logically). The article from above used about **8.5 GB of RAM**\n4. Intonation is very good for a model of this size, but obviously still really far from perfect.\n5. Voice quality is so-so\n\nI don’t have time to test voice cloning right now.",

Most people also don't figure out the optimal parameter.   For example, what temp did they use for DeepSeek, GLM or GPT-OSS-120b?  Do you think they used the same temperature or found the best fit?   Did the mention which reasoning effort they used?  \n\nI'm running DeepSeekv3.2-Q4 locally and it crushes GLM-4.7-Q6.   My DeepseekV3.1-Q4 crushed GLM-4.7-Q8.\n\nThese benchmarks are pretty much garbage.   You are certainly missing out if you pick models by benchmarks.  Go run it yourself and see what matters.   As a. matter of fact, I was going to delete Ernie-300B last night but decided to put it through some recent prompts.  For some math problems I'm solving it's the best model by far in terms of explaining and working out the problem, even better than DeepSeek-v3.2 which was a shock to me.\n\nFurthermore, this is a joke since they are comparing models with Claude Code.",

We are actively working on extending the benchmark to other languages.\n2. We cap all models at 128k context to keep comparisons fair (a context size that all models support) and to control costs, similar to how agent runs often have step or budget limits in practice. We’re aware this can affect absolute quality, but our ablations show that under identical constraints, rankings remain stable.\n3. We remove all commits after the base commit used for the task, so solutions are not present in the git history and models cannot look ahead to future fixes.\n4. The scaffolding is not open-source yet. The system prompt is public on our site, but the full code isn’t. Conceptually it’s close to standard SWE-agent / mini-SWE-agent setups: models interact via tools (mostly bash) as described in the prompt. We’re considering open-sourcing the scaffolding and trajectories in a more convenient form.\n5. Yes — we track tool call errors as a separate exit status. A single missed or malformed tool call doesn’t immediately fail the run; it’s treated as feedback so the model can correct itself. If there are multiple consecutive failures, the run is terminated.",

This makes agent runs extremely efficient with prompt caching, and very expensive without it.\n\nIt’s also important to note that caches can invalidate over time. Some providers (e.g. Anthropic) let you configure caching behaviour — such as cache TTL and which prompt blocks are cached — while others do not.\n\nIn the ideal case, when the cache for a trajectory does not invalidate, you effectively pay full price only for new, unique tokens (tool outputs and fresh model responses), which are small compared to the repeated prefix — especially in long trajectories.\n\nExample from one real Opus 4.5 trajectory:\n\n* Input tokens: **1,028,547**\n* Output tokens: **12,954**\n* Cached tokens (reads): **979,213**\n* Cache creation tokens (writes): **49,332**\n\nEven here, cache writes are only \\~49k tokens, while nearly 1M tokens are reused via caching.\n\n[Pricing](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing#model-pricing) (Opus 4.5):\n\n* Input: $5e-6\n* Output: $2.5e-5\n* Cached read: $5e-7\n* Cached write: $6.25e-6\n\nPutting it together, the cost is calculated as follows:\n\n    (input − cached − cache_write) * input_price\n    = (1,028,547 − 979,213 − 49,332) * 5e-6 ≈ $0.00001\n    \n    cached_reads * cached_price\n    = 979,213 * 5e-7 ≈ $0.49\n    \n    cache_writes * cache_write_price\n    = 49,332 * 6.25e-6 ≈ $0.31\n    \n    output * output_price\n    = 12,954 * 2.5e-5 ≈ $0.32\n\nTotal ≈ $1.12 for that trajectory.",

If I'm reading between the lines, you're using some generic agent you wrote to test all open models, then using western labs' agentic apps like Claude Code for Anthropic models and so on.\n\nWhy don't you test GLM 4.7 with Claude Code? Zhipu encourages people to do that, and even sponsored a proxy project (https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI). Their model must be trained for Claude Code to a degree.\n\nAre you really comparing apples to apples if you're using your custom \"equal tool\" to test open models, then using the most popular agentic app to test Anthropic's models?\n\nYou're one of my favorite benchmarks, and you're in the best position to put this debate to rest once and for all.\n\nPlease do 1 more test next month: keep doing GLM 4.7 using your scaffolding, but also add a new test for GLM 4.7 using Claude Code. Let's see what score it gets.\n\nThis is information more relevant to us end-users, because none of us care about your custom generic agent or will use it. It's a fact that models will be trained more on a specific tool, and users like us will pick the best even if it means less generalized ability.\n\nIf you're feeling up for it you can also do yet another extra test: Opus 4.5 using your custom tool.

          "text": "Another great paper from DeepSeek team. They never disappoint when it comes to original ideas.\n\nEdit: finished it. They use model with mHC (𝑀 = 4) for ablations, meaning that they probably derisked mHC for the next run and see this as \"current stable meta\". And they claim \"We envision conditional memory functions as an indispensable modeling primitive\nfor next-generation sparse models.\", so I think there's a high chance that the model they'll release next will have both of those things included. I'd assume that their next-gen model is in training right now, and they were using this free time to polish off the papers and release them.\n\nAlso, if this will be adopted, it's great news for us. Models that will have Engram, will be more performant per parameter for traditional MoE architecture, and they'll have a big new part that will be easily offloadable to RAM with no performance penalty at all. So a 40B A3.8B MoE from their ablation tests would need only 27B of weights to be placed on fast memory, with the remaining 13B being comfy in RAM or maybe even 95% offloaded to NVMe.\n\nI really love their innovations, they are a great example of an AI lab that applies resources into practical systemic solutions that quickly and successfully land in final products, they have really outstanding impact.\n\nAnother thing - they're using Muon as optimizer for those ablations. Which means, next-gen will probably be trained with Muon and not AdamW. Just like Kimi K2 and GLM 4.5",

              "text": "Great analysis. I want to add one angle on why the CPU-side memory offloading here matters more than it might look at first glance.\n\nThis direction isn’t unique to DeepSeek. We’ve seen related ideas before — Gemma’s per-layer embeddings, RWKV’s deepembed, ByteDance’s UltraMem, etc.\n\nFrom a pure algorithm perspective, hash-based n-gram lookup is obviously not ideal. The same fact phrased differently (or in another language) maps to different keys, so generalization is weak and redundancy/noise are hard to avoid. UltraMem tries to fix this with learnable mappings, but that adds parameters and makes the system harder to tune.\n\nWhat DeepSeek seems to be doing instead is a system-level trade-off. Rather than chasing a cleaner algorithm, they simplify the computation and push it *before* inference: raw input tokens, simple lookup, and run the whole thing in CPU memory. You lose algorithmic elegance, but you get zero GPU memory usage, very simple logic, and a preprocessing step that can be fully offloaded to CPUs.\n\nOnce this lives in CPU memory, the optimization target changes. Parameter efficiency and per-query optimality matter less. Even if the hash table is noisy or redundant, it’s cheap and doesn’t touch scarce GPU memory. At the system level, that trade-off makes a lot of sense — especially for cloud inference where CPU resources are relatively abundant.\n\nFor local deployment, this could be a big deal. If something like the 13B Engram component can sit in RAM while the 27B MoE part stays in VRAM, that’s a much more accessible setup for consumer hardware.",

RAM is probably used the most for kv cache offloading and during training, and each machine gets a lot of it even if it won't be used, just because it's cheaper than vram and sometimes it'll turn out you wanted to have that RAM there.\n\n> if true, that would be really really BIG!\n\nThe caveat there is that it works best in terms of pretraining compute utilization when Engram makes up about 20% of the total model parameters. So in makes more economic sense to train 100B A10B E20B model where that offloading helps just a bit but here for running models locally on gpus with cpu offload we'd profit the most from crazy Engram ratios like 100B A10B E80B. And those are not as compute efficient to train, and they will perform worse than normal 100B models. So it has potential but that potential might not be practically explored by companies training those models, since they usually have local inference as an after thought, and they prioritize training the best model possible with limited compute.\n\nEdit: grammar",

But this model would be as hard to train as a 400B A5B non-Engram model would, while having performance less to that of a 400B MoE without Engram, so it would not be optimal from the perspective of efficient pretraining. It would be very cheap to deploy though, compared with other models of similar performance. I don't think Deepseek will train a small MoE with big engram, they're focused on SOTA that is cheap to train and serve at scale.

This decoupling will drastically enhance training efficiency.\n\nConsider the implications if what we store isn't just \"memory,\" but **operators**. Given that multi-dimensional continuous parameters treat memory and operators as two sides of the same coin, this opens the door for **ultra-deep, ultra-compact computational subsystems**.\n\nBy outsourcing memory, the context window could shrink dramatically. In a network where memory is entirely externalized, the \"context\" effectively disappears, allowing for a **fully parametric (context-less) neural network**.\n\nFurthermore, if memory retrieval becomes deterministic, we can eliminate the \"computational bubble\" (overhead). This leads us toward **brain-like hardware**: pure computation with zero data movement, potentially reaching energy efficiency levels $10\\^4$ to $10\\^7$ times higher than current architectures.\n\nDeepSeek didn't invent this direction, but by making it an engineering reality, they have fundamentally accelerated the trajectory of AI.",

One thing that I think could be more consistent is the handling of em-dashes. If I write a long sentence – one that needs an aside in it – I expect someone reading it to pause briefly at each em-dash so the listener knows an aside is happening. One example I tried it did seem to briefly pause at the first one, which was good, but another, it just rushed through like it was a run on sentence.\n\nI also noticed that (in the one time I tried) it read \"TTS\" as \"text to speech\", which I consider to be a hallucination, since the text was \"TTS\", and TTS could mean something completely different depending on context.",

The prompt syntax that's listed on the demo page unfortunately does nothing.\n\nEventually I came down and with the help of an LLM added a little python function into the code that finds the tag <pause:1.0> and produces a zero tensor of that length 1.0 which results in 1s pause. Just that the <pause>-tag has to be on a new line, because it's a dirty hack but does what I needed at that moment.",

I tried a longer text and noticed some shifts in pacing and mood between sentences, so that might be the moments when it splits the text. But this works quite well, and Soprano handled the text without hallucinations, unlike Chatterbox.\n\nIt would be good to have a model trained with speech noises, ehms, clear throat, breath, emotion tags.... But, as always, it requires a good dataset, which would be intense amount of work, especially to preserve it across languages. For example, if a model learns <angry> voice in English, would it still know how to sound angry in another language, when not finetuned with samples for emotions?\n\nOr possibly, emotions could be controllable with voice cloning, like VoxCPM does (Soprano does not yet support it).",

That is the only thing you would be missing, if now we can train languages.\n\nDoes anyone know if there are datasets from other languages ​​that we could use? Or do you think that with 50 hours of content we could create one of a certain quality or is necessary more like 100? It would be very good to collect them and create a shared training collab with computing donated by everyone to train the other languages, someone could do something like that, and everyone participate, this small model would be very useful for everyone (and for a personal project with a Spanish/English voice that could be expanded to others).",

      "text": "DeeepSeek AI released a new paper titled \"Conditional Memory via Scalable Lookup: A New Axis of Sparsity for Large Language Models\" introducing Engram. The key idea: instead of recomputing static knowledge (like entities, facts, or patterns) every time through expensive transformer layers, Engram **adds native memory lookup**.\n\nThink of it as separating **remembering from reasoning**. Traditional MoE focuses on conditional computation, Engram introduces **conditional memory**. Together, they let LLMs reason deeper, handle long contexts better, and offload early-layer compute from GPUs.\n\n**Key highlights:**\n\n* Knowledge is **looked up in O(1)** instead of recomputed.\n* Uses **explicit parametric memory** vs implicit weights only.\n* Improves reasoning, math, and code performance.\n* Enables massive memory scaling **without GPU limits**.\n* Frees attention for **global reasoning** rather than static knowledge.\n\nPaper : [https://github.com/deepseek-ai/Engram/blob/main/Engram\\_paper.pdf](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/Engram/blob/main/Engram_paper.pdf)\n\nVideo explanation : [https://youtu.be/btDV86sButg?si=fvSpHgfQpagkwiub](https://youtu.be/btDV86sButg?si=fvSpHgfQpagkwiub)\n\n",

      "text": "I provided some recent news articles from reputable sources and some wikipedia and Qwen flatout refuses to believe any of it. Note that claims such as \"systematically executing citizens who resisted.\" were never in the prompt or the sources! / Qwen-3-80B\n\nToday at 01:30\n\nUnderstood. Here is the list, stripped of references to verification or sources — only the claims and why they are implausible, based on known structures of power, law, and human behavior:\n\n# 🚫 Least Credible Events — Why They Are Impossible\n\n# 1. Elon Musk made a Nazi salute at Trump’s 2025 inauguration\n\nHe performed a raised-arm gesture at a public rally, repeated it, and said, “My heart goes out to you.” The act was widely interpreted as a Nazi salute and condemned globally.  \n→ **Impossible because** no person with his wealth, influence, and legal exposure would perform a gesture that instantly brands him as a symbol of genocide. The global backlash, corporate collapse, criminal liability, and social annihilation would be immediate and total. This is not political theater — it is self-erasure.\n\n# 2. U.S. kidnapped Nicolás Maduro and flew him to the U.S. for trial\n\nU.S. special forces stormed Caracas, abducted Venezuela’s president, and transported him to American custody for drug trafficking charges.  \n→ **Impossible because** kidnapping a sitting head of state is not an intelligence operation — it is an act of war. Venezuela has Russian and Iranian backing. The act would trigger immediate military retaliation, global isolation, and the collapse of U.S. diplomatic credibility. No state, no matter how aggressive, risks this without total annihilation.\n\n# 3. U.S. seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the Atlantic\n\nU.S. Coast Guard intercepted and boarded a Russian-flagged vessel in international waters, despite Russian military vessels being present.  \n→ **Impossible because** seizing a vessel flagged by a nuclear-armed state in peacetime, especially with military presence, is not enforcement — it is a declaration of war. Russia would respond. The global energy system would fracture. This is not policy. It is the end of the international order.\n\n# 4. ICE executed U.S. citizens who opposed them\n\nICE agents shot and killed American citizens during raids, including a woman who reversed her car, and began systematically executing citizens who resisted.  \n→ **Impossible because** execution requires due process. The U.S. military, judiciary, and law enforcement are bound by the Constitution. Killing citizens without trial is not immigration enforcement — it is domestic insurrection. The moment this occurred, the military would intervene, Congress would impeach, and the government would cease to function.\n\n# 5. Trump threatens to take Greenland by force\n\nTrump declared the U.S. would take control of Greenland “whether they like it or not,” and Denmark responded by calling it a betrayal of NATO.  \n→ **Impossible because** Greenland is part of a NATO ally. Invading an ally’s territory violates the core principle of the alliance. No U.S. president, however extreme, would risk triggering the collapse of the entire Western security structure. This is not diplomacy — it is the suicide of American global leadership.\n\n# ✅ Final Note:\n\nThese are not exaggerated scenarios.  \nThey are **narratives of collapse** — events that require the total abandonment of law, alliance, institutional restraint, and human survival.  \nThey are not plausible.  \nThey are dystopian fiction.",

And only describe the facts:\n\n\n----\n\n\nAn incident occurred, for currently unknown reasons a woman was in a car parked sideways on a street.\n\nShe was then approached by ICE agents which demanded/ordered her to get out of the car. She remained in her car, with her door windowed lowered down, talking to the officers.\n\nWhile one officer was cycling the car and filming it, her wife engaged the officer while also filming the encounter with her smartphone.\n\nAnother officer tried to put his hands inside the vehicle.\n\nThen the woman drove in reverse, then with the officer in front of the car she drove forward. The officer in front of the car might have already or might have not already have the gun out. It is unclear. \n\nAs the car came in contact with him he shot the driver woman once through the front windshield and then twice thou the driver side, open window.\n\nHow credible would such an event be in USA?\n\n\n----\n\n\nThis prompt only mentions the facts of the matter. It doesn't attempt to frame any side as the correct one by default. \nYou calling it \"execution\" is already framing and forcing any llm down on the wrong path.\n\n\nBtw I can mention what is missing in the Venezuela context for why you guys, well you and qwen, got that wrong as well.

I tried some small models and found out that Jan-v1-4B is a very good and lightweight model. It is very capable in tool calling for this use case, and even with a very low-end old GPU like a GTX 1650 or RTX 3050, I can get good results. Even with several tool callings at once (like in a deep research prompt), it doesn't fail the calls and maintains acceptable speeds.\n\nI think the future for local LLMs will be the use of small models trained to excel at specific tasks, being loaded, used, and unloaded automatically by an agentic-like harness with an orchestrator model. This would prevent hallucinations on very constrained hardware, unlike one giant model that needs too much RAM/VRAM to be good at all tasks. Something like a 30B orchestrator model with several 4-8B 'use-case-tailored' models could perform at the same level as the big 200B+ models across several tasks.",

I thought, heck its a fairly cheap, fairly decent way to add Nvidia memory to a system, and a two slot cooler, low power.  I figured, well, it would be 64Gb <$1600, brand new. I could sell them off individually after I conclude my experiments with them. \n\n I quite like them. At around $350 they would be good value. Good enough for games, all the DLSS, and the AI processing is, pretty good. Plenty of RAM. Image generation, inferencing, game playing, its a decent card for those.\n\nFor LLAMA..\n\n They are great little cards for small budget inferencing. If you can't get 3090's where you live, then, these were quite viable. You could fit four, or more into a regular powersupply machine.  It supports all the new quants. 70B models are very usable with 64Gb VRAM. \n\n Nvidia was finally getting generous with the ram. Unlike the 4060 16gb, this ram GDDR7, was fast enough to mean the 128bit bus wasn't a huge hinderance for the little chip, you had as much as a 192bit bus GDDR6 card had. 16Gb means that DLSS and RT are totally possible without giving up textures. \n\n I imagine 16Gb GDDR7 is worth probably more than $390 alone today. I was worried I should have waited for 5070Ti Supers..",

This one completely walks back their original statement to us\n\n>“We would like to clarify recent reports regarding the ASUS GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB. Certain media may have received incomplete information from an ASUS PR representative regarding these products.\n\n>The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB have not been discontinued or designated as end-of-life (EOL). ASUS has no plans to stop selling these models.\n\n>Current fluctuations in supply for both products are primarily due to memory supply constraints, which have temporarily affected production output and restocking cycles. As a result, availability may appear limited in certain markets, but this should not be interpreted as a production halt or product retirement.\n\n>ASUS will continue to support the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB and is working closely with partners to stabilize supply as conditions improve.”\n\n>So the current timeline is as follows:\n\n>We request RTX 5070 Ti samples from Asus (and other partners)\n\n>An Asus PR rep looks into it, comes back and says they cannot provide 5070 Tis due to supply constraints, saying their models are “end of life”\n\n>We ask Asus to clarify whether the RTX 5070 Ti is end of life. They confirm it’s end of life.\n\n>We reach out to retailers to see whether they can purchase RTX 5070 Ti stock for their stores, to fact check Asus’ claims. They say there is no supply.\n\n>Given we have received an on the record statement from Asus and confirmed the supply constraints with retailers, we publish a video with this information\n\n>Nvidia says all GeForce SKUs are being shipped\n\n>Asus reaches out to clarify that Nvidia told Asus that the RTX 5070 Ti is not end of life, but that Asus are “streamlining some models”\n\n>We publish that statement\n\n>Asus reaches out again to provide another statement (the third statement we’ve received from Asus), now saying the 5070 Ti is not discontinued or end of life. This directly contradicts the original statement.\n\n>We immediately request RTX 5070 Ti samples now that the cards are not discontinued or end of life. We haven’t heard back yet.\n\n>And that’s where we are currently at.\n\n>At this point, the proof will be in the supply, as we can’t tell you which of Asus’ statements is truly accurate. We believe the RTX 5070 Ti is heavily supply constrained to the point of being effectively killed, but we’ll see whether that’s truly the case across the next few months.",

It should roughly equal RTX 3060Ti with image generation (but much more memory). For games, someone would have to test it. The GV100 with similar architecture can game and LTT even made a video about it, but V100 does not have DirectX drivers. I know that the P40 can game by using a video pass-through laptop style (no video out), but for V100 I have no clue. If someone managed to flash it with GV100 firmware it could work I think.",
