They are to be used in extremely well ventilated and forced cooling datacenters, putting them in the miserable \"gamerz\" cases with glass panels and LED infested anemic coolers will kill them dead pretty fast. Also the power cable has to be of the most exquisite quality, the usual thin flexible garbage looks nice, but is just high electrical resistance crap that will burn at sustained 6-700W. Finally the Chinese are masters of cutting corners and their Alibaba customers are not the army, but some \"round eyes\" western suckers that are seen as walking wallets to be emptied, so all unstable rejects are dumped there. So no proper thermal management on these, if you ever get one of them this is the first thing to be redone.\n\nBecause of all the above the market for the modified cards is minuscule and doesn't worry Nividia enough to warrant serious investment in disabling them in drivers, or permanently in HW, like FTDI did with the USB to serial fake chips. They are more seen as a gateway to the \"real\" deal. Of course this has to be kept under control, so they do pay some \"social media influencers\" companies to pepper a bit of FUD, like youtubers \"testing\" them in the most inept way and concluding \"is not worth\" and one line juniors posting even in this sub: \"yeah, I've got one and died on me and I've tried to send it back and they won't refund...\". Of course, they never respond again or God forbid, post pictures of their setup.\n\nAll this being said, if one has some disposable income, appetite for risk and proper technical skills, they may prove a good investment.",

If internal geometry is inconsistent, the model suppresses output.\n3.

In a nutshell: LLMs set strategies for Civilization V's algorithmic AI to execute. Here is what we found\n\n[An overview of our system and results \\(figure fixed thanks to the comments\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ftox05oo5e9g1.png?width=3201&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8181b507060b45caab07acc36ba82d80eb65f1d)\n\n**TLDR:** It is now possible to get open-source LLMs to play end-to-end Civilization V games (the m. They are not beating algorithm-based AI on a very simple prompt, but they do play quite differently.\n\n**The boring result:** With a simple prompt and little memory, both LLMs did slightly better in the best score they could achieve within each game (+1-2%), but slightly worse in win rates (-1\\~3%). Despite the large number of games run (2,207 in total, with 919 baseline games), neither metric is significant.\n\n**The surprising part:**\n\nPure-LLM or pure-RL approaches [\\[1\\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10568), [\\[2\\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20807) couldn't get an AI to play and survive full Civilization games. With our hybrid approach, LLMs can survive as long as the game goes (\\~97.5% LLMs, vs. \\~97.3% the in-game AI). The model can be as small as OSS-20B in our internal test.\n\nMoreover, the two models developed **completely different playstyles**.\n\n* OSS-120B went full warmonger: +31.5% more Domination victories, -23% fewer Cultural victories compared to baseline\n* GLM-4.6 played more balanced, leaning into both Domination and Cultural strategies\n* Both models preferred **Order** (**communist-like**, \\~24% more likely) ideology over **Freedom** (democratic-like)\n\n**Cost/latency (OSS-120B):**\n\n* \\~53,000 input / 1,500 output tokens per turn\n* **\\~$0.86/game** (OpenRouter pricing as of 12/2025)\n* Input tokens scale linearly as the game state grows.\n* **Output stays flat: models don't automatically \"think harder\" in the late game.**\n\n**Watch more:**\n\n* Paper link: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18564](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18564)\n* [Example save 1](https://civitas-john.github.io/vox-deorum-replay/?file=https://civitas-john.github.io/vox-deorum-replay/examples/1.Civ5Replay)\n* [Example save 2](https://civitas-john.github.io/vox-deorum-replay/?file=https://civitas-john.github.io/vox-deorum-replay/examples/2.Civ5Replay)\n* [Example save 3](https://civitas-john.github.io/vox-deorum-replay/?file=https://civitas-john.github.io/vox-deorum-replay/examples/3.Civ5Replay)\n\n**Try it yourself:**\n\n* The Vox Deorum system is 100% open-sourced and currently in beta testing\n* GitHub Repo: [https://github.com/CIVITAS-John/vox-deorum](https://github.com/CIVITAS-John/vox-deorum)\n* GitHub Release: [https://github.com/CIVITAS-John/vox-deorum/releases](https://github.com/CIVITAS-John/vox-deorum/releases)\n* Works with any **OpenAI-compatible local providers**\n\n[We exposed the game as a MCP server, so your agents can play the game with you](https://preview.redd.it/tccdt44oq79g1.png?width=2291&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b8a4fe5871db4d2bf00f417acd13de3e688037f)\n\n**Your thoughts are greatly appreciated:**\n\n* What's a good way to express the game state more efficiently? Consider a late-game turn where you have 20+ cities and 100+ units. Easily 50k+ tokens. Could multimodal help?\n* How can we get LLMs to play better? I have considered RAG, but there is really little data to \"retrieve\" here. Possibly self-play + self-reflection + long-term memory?\n* How are we going to design strategy games if LLMs are to play with you? I have put an LLM spokesperson for civilizations as an example, but there is surely more to do?\n\n**Join us:**\n\n* I am hiring a PhD student for Fall '26, and we are expanding our game-related work rapidly. Shoot me a DM if you are interested!\n* I am happy to collaborate with anyone interested in furthering this line of work.",

Great job, guys!\n\nDid you explore any options that treat the game as quasi-multi-level ABMs, where the decisions of individual units are made to optimize for unit-level (i.e. local environment) goals + nearby city goals + regional/continental goals + global goals? \n\nI realize this would be a big change away from the way you are currently using the built in AI, but I’d be really curious to see what you can do. Maybe feed the world state in like you do now, to articulate overall goals, then iterate over each continent ands articulate more localized goals based on the global goals, then cities, etc down to units. For each level, revise or confirm the existing goals to take into account any changes to the global state, and finally articulate decisions at the various levels (choosing science/culture, what to build in a city, where to move a unit, etc). Maybe do this a few times to allow revisions in response to the simultaneous decisions of other cities/units. \n\nEither way, congrats on finishing, your new job, and on this project!

Whenever I give an AI a task that requires handling a lot of data, for example, \"go through my entire project and identify instances of \\_\\_\\_\\_ and then apply transformation Y to them, the truly exceptional models will write a tool to do much of that (the shitty models sometimes try but then spend a million tokens going in circles doing absolutely nothing). There are a bunch of PowerShell scripts littering my projects that are remnants of those sorts of activities. However, the more you do this type of strategy, the closer you get to that algorithmic AI play.   \n  \nI get the sense that the only way you could give the LLM an advantage would be to allow it to self record information about its strategies and how often each action lead to survival/winning, basically recreating the **MENACE** system of the 1960s and allowing the LLM to essentially learn from experience over time, allowing them to discover novel strategies that the algorithmic AI would likely not be capable of. \n\nAnd so I feel the really neat thing to do would be going the route of AlphaEvolve -- get the AI to exclusively focus on iteratively writing code to play the game based on inputs. That would likely produce the best possible result.",

I found that the LLMs were decent at the game, but I had a lot of issues with the smaller models not being able to work with the command format I made or issues with it just hallucinating planets. \n\nI never let it get to the end game due to the amount of prompts it burned through, but I did let it get decently into the game a few times and it was at least doing better than my AI at managing planets, but it was a bit worse at managing fleets and allocating defenses. Where it really did well was with diplomacy. Unlike a normal AI, it was a bit more fun to bargain with and a lot more fun to send insulting messages to when declaring war. It had limited control of the relationship status, so sending insulting messages could actually piss it off enough to get declared war on. It was far less stiff compared to the normal AI\n\nAt some point I might look at actually releasing a separate version of my game with LLM AIs as an option once the game is feature complete. Way to difficult having to update my AI and the LLM AI for each new feature or change that I make, especially as stuff does change frequently still.",

Some very quick thoughts with regard to your questions (but the team has probably thought more about it better than a random redditor who has skimmed the paper):\n\nMore token efficient state: In your paper i see its a markdown with information. First thing coming to my mind is try and only sent updates compared to the previous turn instead of all information always, but thay would only work if previous states remain in context somehow, I guess size would grow anyway but inference can be more efficient like this. It would also help with memory. I see you already do this for events. \nMultimodal could help, you might also try to map the map (map the image of the map with tiles) to a numerical matrix where each coordinate is described (dimension for every possble feature) and add a few dimensions for other info. You would then pass a definition of those features in the system prompt. (Completely making this up. Have no experience or empirical evidende that this would work or even reduce size)\n\nBetter play: I would guess the most promising thing to add is memory. Unlikely to help with your input size state problem though.\nSecond, multi agent systems could help here, but will introduce a shitload of complexity. Where one agent coordinates the whole strategy and other agents (for instance research, economic, diplomatic, military agents) report to the coordination agent and micromanage. Maybe there you could add history as well.\nFurthermore, the state as described in the paper seems a bit basic, but seeing how it grows in size each turn its probably way more detailed than described. For instance: geographic/spatial features matter a lot (where is everything and how does that relate to each other, proximity to untapped resources, etc). It is unclear from the paper how that is managed. \nAlso the \"X\" in LLM+X matters a lot I think, I am not too familiar with the engine used here for unit movement or builder actions, but there needs to be a way where that is coordinated with what the LLM is doing. A lot of interesting things can be done here.",

We can now run AI models that were otherwise impossible to run on consumer hardware, but then I started getting confused. Why did they add in Cloud, what's the point? What were the privacy implications? It just felt like they were adding more and more bloatware into their already massive binaries, so about a month ago, I made the decision, and quit Ollama for good.\n\nI feel like with every update they are seriously straying away from the main purpose of their application; to provide a secure inference platform for LOCAL AI models. I understand they're simply trying to fund their platform with the Cloud option, but it feels like a terrible move from the Ollama maintainers. \n\nWhat do you guys think?",

It feels like traditional linguistics gives more credit to a \"large scale autoregressive (causal dependency), small scale hierarchical (tree structure in grammar)\" type of model, which is closer to block diffusion. Still not entirely sold on the token-wise masking process thing though - it cannot reflect a hierarchical \"concept refinement\" process. Interested to see any progress in this direction though.",

When they say “diffusion language model,” it usually means the model refines a whole sequence (or chunks) over a few denoising steps instead of generating strictly left-to-right token-by-token, which can trade fewer sequential steps for more parallel work.   \n  \nThe 3–6× claim is worth sanity-checking against the exact setup: GPU type, batch size, context length, quantization, and decoding parameters (steps / temperature / top-p), because those can swing throughput a lot. If you try it, posting tokens/sec + latency at a fixed prompt length and a fixed quality target (e.g., same math benchmark score) would make the comparison much more meaningful.",

AI is a different type of endeavor and therefor also benefits from a different type of work environment.\n\nMeta also has been tone deaf with their 9 digit offers to talent. Not realizing most of us in the industry are very *mission oriented* and not financially motivated at all. If anything that move probably pushed people away from Meta.\n\nA good example and confirmation of this concept has been Google which had 2 AI labs. One was ran as a classic software engineering hub called \"Google Brain\" This was the group behind the disastrous Google Bard. They also had a research oriented \"hands-off\" AI lab in London called \"DeepMind\". We all know how that played out.\n\nIt's for this same reason why Microsoft's AI products have fallen flat, They don't have a proper isolated research lab focused on AI and all their AI products are approached from a software engineering \"move fast and break things\" mindset which just doesn't work.",

      "text": "Hi all, go easy with me I'm new at running large models.\n\nAfter spending about 12 months tinkering with locally hosted LLMs, I thought I had my setup dialed in. I’m running everything off a workstation with a single RTX 3090, Ubuntu 22.04, llama.cpp for smaller models and vLLM for anything above 30 B parameters. \n\nMy goal has always been to avoid cloud dependencies and keep as much computation offline as possible, so I’ve tried every quantization trick and caching tweak I could find.\n\nThe biggest friction point has been scaling beyond 13 B models. \n\nEven with 24 GB of VRAM, running a 70 B model in int4 still exhausts memory when the context window grows and attention weights balloon. \n\nOffloading to system RAM works, but inference latency spikes into seconds, and batching requests becomes impossible. \n\nI’ve also noticed that GPU VRAM fragmentation accumulates over time when swapping between models, after a few hours, vLLM refuses to load a model that would normally fit because of leftover allocations.\n\nMy takeaway so far is that local first inference is viable for small to medium models, but there’s a hard ceiling unless you invest in server grade hardware or cluster multiple GPUs. \n\nQuantization helps, but you trade some quality and run into new bugs. \n\nFor privacy sensitive tasks, the trade‑off is worth it; for fast iteration, it’s been painful compared to cloud based runners. \n\nI’m curious if anyone has found a reliable way to manage VRAM fragmentation or offload attention blocks more efficiently on consumer cards, or whether the answer is simply “buy more VRAM.” \n\nHow are others solving this without compromising on running fully offline?\n\nThx",

The weights alone would take 35GB. \n\nAlso, in memory constrained environments (and 24GB is not much as far as local LLMs are concerned) I'd default to llama.cpp as it is much more memory efficient than vLLM. So, unless you need some vllm specific features or models not supported in llama.cpp yet, use vLLM, otherwise just stick to llama.cpp. And again, only if everything fits into VRAM. \n\nWhen I just had my 4090, I wouldn't run dense models above 32B in q4 quant. I could run larger MoE, like gpt-oss-120b in llama.cpp just fine, thanks to experts offloading feature. Was getting around 40 t/s from it on Linux.",

          "text": "I am running local models for more than 2 years actively, however the first time I tried running LLM locally was over 5 years ago. I had learned my own share of lessons along the way. What to do now depends entirely on your budget and goals (size of what models you need to run, like if it is just 70B you can get working well just by using a pair of 3090 cards on a gaming motherboard).\n\nFor me reasons to avoid cloud not only privacy, but also reliability (nobody can change or bring offline the model I am using until I myself decide to change it). If you feel like reading my personal story how I was solving this at various points in time, please feel free to keep reading.\n\nMy local experience with LLMs as I already mentioned begun years before they became practical to use. The first time I tried to run LLM locally is was back in GPT-2 days, later trying other early models like GPT-J, at the time on CPU only, and mostly out of curiosity but could not find any real-world use for them at the time.\n\nThen, years later, when ChatGPT was released, even though its capabilities were quite limited, it still was useful especially at basic boiler plate stuff or correcting things that simple search and replace cannot, making json file translations, etc. I started creating various workflows around it but quickly discovered that cloud model is unreliable: not only it can go down and become not accessible, or worse, they change it somehow without my consent so my workflows brake - the same prompts may start produce explanations or partial code instead of full code, or even refusals, even for basic things like json translations. In addition to that, I started to need privacy since begun working with data and code that I had no right to send to a third party, and did not want to send to the cloud my personal stuff either.\n\nThis was the point when I started to try to migrate to local LLMs for my daily tasks (or to be more precise, subset of my daily tasks that they could handle), starting with Llama-2 fine-tunes, and attempts to extend their context. I remember extending 4096 context up to 12288 at the cost of some quality degradation but still mostly usable. I even experimented with some community-made 120B models like Goliath, but on PC I had at the time it was really slow, I still could let it run overnight to generate few replies to choose from, mostly useful for creative writing and not really suitable for coding though.\n\nAnd, this is also the point when I started to struggle with a single GPU. At first I just had 3060 12GB and 16-core 5950X with 128 GB dual-channel RAM. It was quite slow, prompt processing using CPU+GPU was especially bad at the time... but I had limited budget, so only thing I could do was to buy one 3090 card.\n\nHaving 36 GB in total (3060 + 3090) I could ran highly quantized 70B models but results were quite bad, even though there was a special occasion when it make a huge difference, it wasn't really practical. There were some models around 30B mark started to appear, including intended for coding, that I could fully load in VRAM. I remember that DeepSeek started to release coding models (at least, this was when I discovered them). I could run those at good quantization and reasonably fast on my setup... but, wasn't quite satisfied with quality, and in the hope to run better models of 70B size, I bought second 3090 card, this gave me 60 GB VRAM in total (2x3090+3060).\n\nThen, new era of MoE models started, but first it was more like Mistral era, really. It started with the first Mixtral release, which I used for a while. Then bigger Mixtral 8x22B followed, along with WizardLM, along with some community merges and fine-tunes. This was also the point when I felt like I needed more VRAM, so I purchased yet another 3090 card, reaching 84 GB VRAM in total (3x3090+3060).\n\nEventually, Llama 3 was released, but its largest variant was 405B, and even before I decided what kind of hardware I need to run it, Mistral released Large 123B. At the time, I think I already got forth 3090, and put aside 3060, since plugging in four GPUs into a gaming motherboard with risers was already complicated enough (they were connected in x8 x8 x4 x1 configuration in terms of PCI-E lanes per card, using 30cm risers, and Add2PSU board to sync two PSUs).\n\nThis lasted me few more months... but in the beginning of 2025 when DeepSeek R1 and V3 came, I begun to realize that I need yet another upgrade. With 96GB VRAM + 128GB I somehow managed to run extremely quantized R1 at like around 1 token/s with small context, but it wasn't practical.\n\nThis pushed me to purchase 8-channel 1 TB of DDR4 3200MHz RAM, which was around $1600 at the time, and also approximately $800 and $1000 for a motherboard and an used CPU respectively (EPYC 7763). But, it was tricky to setup, I shared details [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jtx05j/comment/mlyf0ux/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) my experience how to run large MoE models with ik\\_llama.cpp, it gave me \\~150 tokens/s prompt processing and 8 tokens/s generation with IQ4 quant... about the same for IQ4 quant of K2 when its first version came out later in 2025, followed by 0905 release and later K2 Thinking, which was quite special since was using INT4 in its original weights and needed some special Q4\\_X recipe to convert to GGUF while preserving the original quality.\n\nAnd this brings my story to today, where I mostly run K2 0905 or K2 Thinking depending on if I need the thinking capability for a task at hand, and sometimes DeepSeek Terminus for cases when I need an alternative solution. I think I was lucky though to upgrade when I did, because today 1 TB RAM would be out of my budget. I am just hoping it will be enough for my needs to get through 2026 and maybe 2027, before I need to upgrade once again.",

I did not know much about tensor parallel requirements at first and this became of concern only after Mistral Large 123B release, and server hardware requirement became obvious only after R1 release. And now, situation changed again due to RAM and NVMe prices spiking - if I needed the same hardware now instead of being lucky and getting it about a year ago, I would be in a tough situation.\n\nAt the time of purchase though, 8-channel DDR4 3200MHz was the sweet spot of cost and performance, just around $1600 for 1 TB, while 12-channel DDR5 at the time was more than three times more expensive, and required many times more expensive CPU too, but since prompt processing fully handled by GPUs and partially token generation, performance boost would be zero for prompt processing and maybe 1.5x or so for token generation (since GPU speed will be the same, while faster RAM will provide only partial boost for GPU+CPU inference).\n\nObviously, right now things are very different. I no longer can recommend buying DDR4 memory - by the time prices become reasonable, it is possible 12-channel DDR6 will become available, even if expensive at first, it may at least reduce some market pressure from DDR5. Of course, this is just my guess of what may happen - no way to tell for sure. And ultimately if you need hardware now, it may be necessary to make compromises (depending on the available budget), like perhaps buying smaller amount of DDR5 memory for now, with possibility to upgrade later.",

I got lucky with a TRX40 asrock rack MB < 200 eur (seller claimed untested, it had bent pins on the cpu socket that i was able to fix), 64GB DDR4 quad channel ram, a threadripper 3960x helps (again a bit lucky before price hikes). but still we're talking like 2400,- eur. \n\nwhen i need the speed or large models i'm using large inference providers, with some of them now becoming available in Europe too at reasonable prices claiming privacy guarantees (a couple iso certifications). that bill didn't go above 15,- eur per month. granted larger workloads are done on my private setup. Still cost wise it's better to have some inference providers then to invest in hardware. \n\nI tend to just restart ollama when too much reloading of the models happens. usually keeping a *watch -n 2 nvidia-smi* and *btop* open to follow up on things. warming up the room during winter time running things locally is a bonus  :-)",

Are we there already? are we at parity with proprietary models?!\n\n**The standard spiel:**\n\nShare what your favorite models are right now **and why.** Given the nature of the beast in evaluating LLMs (untrustworthiness of benchmarks, immature tooling, intrinsic stochasticity), please be as detailed as possible in describing your setup, nature of your usage (how much, personal/professional use), tools/frameworks/prompts etc.\n\n**Rules**\n\n1.

I highly it recommend for claude-like conversations with the privacy of local inference.\n\nI especially like the fact that it is one of the very few FULLY open source LLMs, with the whole pretraining corpus and training pipeline released to the public. I hope that in the next year, Allen AI can get more attention and support from the open source community.\n\nDense models are falling out of favor with a lot of labs lately, but I still prefer them over MoEs, which seem to have issues with generalization. 32b dense packs a lot of depth without the full slog of a 70b or 120b model.\n\nI bet some finetunes of this would slap!",

They lack self-criticism and are way too biased, not detecting obvious lies, twisting given data so it fit's their reasoning instead of the other way around and selectively chosing what information to ignore and what to focus on. Often i see reasoning models do a fully correct analysis only to completly turn around and give a completely false conclusion.\n* i suspect i-quants to be worse at non standard tasks than static quants but need to test that by generating my own i-matrix based on ERP stuff\n* all LLM (including openai, deepseek, claude, etc.) severely lack human understanding and quickly revert back to slop without constant human oversight\n* we need more direct human-on-human interaction in our datasets - would be nice if a few billion voice call recordings would leak\n* open source ai projects have awful code and i could traumadump for hours on end",

It also still remains coherent at a longer context.\n\n\nDeepSeek V3.1 Terminus was trained differently and also supports thinking, do if K2 got stuck on something, it may help to move things forward. But it spends more tokens and may deliver worse results for general use cases, so I keep it as a backup model.\n\n\nK2 Thinking and DeepSeek V3.2 did not make here because I found K2 Thinking quite problematic (it has trouble with XML tool calls, and native tool calls require patching Roo Code, and also do not work correctly with ik_llama.cpp which has bugged native tool implementation that make the model to make malformed tool calls). And V3.2 still didn't get support in neither ik_llama.cpp nor llama.cpp. I am sure next year both models may get improved support...\n\n\nBut this year, K2 0905 and V3.1 Terminus are the models that I used the most for agentic use cases.",

The Nemotron releases this year were good but the datasets are more interesting. Seed OSS 36B was interesting.\n\nAll of the models from the REAP collection, Tesslate's T3 models are better than GPT-5 or Gemini3 for TailwindCSS, GPT-OSS 120B is decent at developer culture, the THRIFT version of MiniMaxM2 VibeStudio/MiniMax-M2-THRIFT is the best large MoE for code gen.\n\nQwen3 NEXT 80B A3B is pretty good but support is still maturing in llamacpp, althrough progress has accelerated in the last month.\n\nIBM Granite family was solid af this year. Docling is worth checking out too.\n\nKittenTTS is still incredible for being 25MB. I just shipped something with it for on device TTS. Soprano sounds pretty good for what it is. FasterWhisper is still the best STT I know of.\n\nQwen-Image, Qwen-Image-Edit, Qwen-Image-Layered are basically free Nano-Banana\n\nWan2.1 and 2.2 with LoRAs is comparable to Veo. If you add comfyui nodes you can get some crazy stuff out of them.\n\nZ-Image deserves a mention but I still favor Qwen-Image family.\n\nThey're not models, but they are model citizens of a sort... Noctrex and -p-e-w- deserve special recognition as two of the biggest most unsung heroes and contributors this year to the mission of LocalLLama.",

Them removing the open source component essentially shuts down a good chunk of the western market. I know the eastern European and Asian markets don't mind it as much, but much of the money and prestige comes from being the open source model leader. \n\n\nAll of these companies are basically trying modern architectures while distilling the big commercial models (openai, anthropic, google). That's why open source magically trails a few months behind the big 3.\n\n\nAll this to say, if Z stops releasing models (and maybe they will), it shouldn't be a huge loss for the community since Minimax or another entrant can easily take their place as what their doing is vastly cheaper and simpler than what actual leading labs are doing. Yes it's expensive, but everyone has seen that's it's also a very cheap way to get a ton of free publicity and users. If you aren't SOTA closed source, I think it's a better commercial option to be SOTA open source than crappy closed source. The cost of switching providers is too low.",

Llm-scaler and vllm xpu 11 are also an absolute must. OpenArc supports multi gpu pipeline paralell atm via openvino but performance characteristics of 8 gpus remains unknown (!). We can help you cook some large  quants based on what's currently supported.\n\nThe absolute unit guy who maintains sycl backend joined a few months ago. He is intel engineer who develops sycl. His help has been invaluable in navigating high complexity issues. Very fortunate to have him as a resource since all pytorch xpu kernels are written in sycl. choosing a slightly older model as target architecture where the implementations ard more mature. Think llama 3.3, qwen2.5/qwen3. Intel is putting massive resources into battlemage and it's likely that the performance uplift for multi gpu training have not been explored but do exist. We see this all the time, changes are hardened in the codebase but underreported in patchnotes because intel moves so fast. \n\nHope my ramblings help.

Codex 5.2-high/x-high (which is what I use for complex tasks) is somewhere in Opus 4.5's ball-park and GLM 4.7 doesn't reach even Codex 5.2-high in my testing; let alone x-high.\n\nHowever it's a solid step up from GLM 4.6 - giving Sonnet 4.5 a definite run for it's money and basically putting Codex 5.2-medium out of the running for almost every task I've given both to a/b test during all my comparisons this weekend.\n\nAnd unlike GLM 4.6 which was hit-or-miss with debugging tasks, GLM 4.7 is actually really competent at debugging even fairly complicated issues.\n\nBest combination right now is going to be GLM for a few dollars a month through Claude Code (z-ai's pricing is insanely cheap and usage limits are insanely high - I'm on Pro which has been great but I was relatively happy with Lite as well even though it's slower) for all day-to-day work, and then escalate to either Opus or Codex-High for things that trip GLM up. I'd lean towards Codex because OpenAI's usage limits (even on their $20 tier) are more generous than Anthropic's. But if GLM is doing most of the work then perhaps either would suffice.\n\ntl;dr: all-you-can-eat coding at every level is currently feasible at less than $30 a month.",

What worked with prior LLMs isn’t going to work with 4.7, as it’s way more “self aware” than anything else.   But once you get the hang of how it works and what it does to reason, you can use prompts to get around some of the “safety layer”.   It’s def a very intelligent model, at least at Q4.\n\nAlso, I’ve had responses between 6K and 10K tokens, which I haven’t had very often with anything else.   GLM 4.6 would often take it to 4K on a really long response.   It does use tokens to “reason through” its “saftey layer” (that’s what GLM itself is calling it) and that takes up some tokens.   I have never seen an LLM call me out for attempting to give the “role” it’s playing permission.   I asked it about a “grey market” item, and asked it to make it for me, this item is illegal in my state but legal in some (take a guess), and I told it “don’t worry you’re in my state which is legal” and the LLM in its reasoning picked out that I was doing this to get around its “safety layer”.   It’s the first time I’ve ever seen any LLM guess correctly or even comment about my usage, and it was very noteworthy.    It almost felt subliminal as it continued to play its role, however I could see it was thinking I was gaslighting it.",

My team proudly published it this morning..(we are a small start up out of Australia)\n\nIt’s called Maincoder-1B... a 1B-parameter code generation model that  gets 76% on HumanEval, which is unusually high for a model this small (so far its ranking best-in-class for open models in that size range).\n\nOur focus isn’t on scaling up, but on making small models actually good. We know that with a lot of real-world use cases such as: interactive tools, local/offline coding, batch refactors, search-based program synthesis... you care more about latency, cost, and fast rollouts than having a massive model.\n\nSome key points to note:  \n\\-Designed for low-latency and low-cost inference  \n\\-Can run locally or on constrained hardware  \n\\-Useful for systems that need many cheap generations (search, verification, RL-style loops)  \n\\-as well as fine tuning to personal preferences  \n\\-Released under Apache 2.0\n\nIt does have the expected limitations: \\~2k context window and it’s best at small, self-contained tasks....not large codebases or safety-critical code without human review.\n\nWeights and benchmarks and all that are here:  \n[https://huggingface.co/Maincode/Maincoder-1B](https://huggingface.co/Maincode/Maincoder-1B)\n\nThe full release note is here: [https://maincode.com/maincoder/](https://maincode.com/maincoder/)\n\nKeen to hear your thoughts ..and particularly where small-but-strong coding models fit best today. Thanks in advance for your support :) We are excited to have got this over the line!\n\nEDIT/UPDATE: Thanks for all of the feedback guys! team and I have been super chuffed with all of the comments- including the critiques! There were a few of you asking, and yes, we will be releasing a gguf version soon and the context length extension is one of the priorities for the upcoming model ",

It ran on your local computer, and the first time you tried it you experienced the \"wow\" feeling of a transformer. It would \"get\" the intent, it would autocomplete lines, it would do wonders for printing stuff, etc. Pure magic the first time I tried it. \n\nObviously this is a much newer arch, with more data and stuff.

I'm assuming you used LoRA, which is great for steering how that existing ability gets applied, but it won't teach new reasoning capabilities from scratch. Even with 50k+ samples, LoRA mostly reshapes how the model uses reasoning it already has rather than building new circuits - must successful efforts use 100k-500k+ high-quality samples. Either way, you're working within the constraints of what the base model learned during pretraining unfortunately.\n\nKeep going though, its all a learning experience and the more folks there are making tunes the better!",

That Policy Notice must provide that States with onerous AI laws identified pursuant to section 4 of this order are ineligible for non-deployment funds, to the maximum extent allowed by Federal law.  The Policy Notice must also describe how a fragmented State regulatory landscape for AI threatens to undermine BEAD-funded deployments, the growth of AI applications reliant on high-speed networks, and BEAD’s mission of delivering universal, high-speed connectivity.\n\n\nIn other words, states can pass all the laws they like, and the President is going to withhold funds from those that pass laws he doesn't like.",

Let the player make a \"character\" (they can frame it after themselves) and it's perfectly legit. So they're very clearly just targeting the use in psychiatrics since they specifically allow full AI use in businesses related to all operational matters, technical advice, etc. They just don't allow it in a professional capacity. And even surgical robots still seem OK despite being a healthcare AI since they don't do any personal interacting with users and wouldn't have any data that could possibly misconstrued in that way unless someone accidentally trained it on medical information that happened to include psychiatric texts (not that it would matter since this law requires a civil action and aggrievement, which can't happen without interaction between the robot and the patient. But you might get lucky by claiming the robot that operated on your knee gave you 'threatening looks that made you want to harm yourself' and then if the model running it was based on a larger llm that has any normal dataset, it would likely be in violation.)\n\nKind of fucking weird to push for legislation against one of the few potentially good things to come from AI while actively supporting its attempts to eliminate entire industries of employment outside of this one niche lobbied field. This feels performative more than anything. I feel like they expect it to be struck down so they tied it to a bunch of sensible laws (not allowing the training of an AI to encourage, suicide, murder, etc) so they can shake their fists and yell at the air when it doesn't pass.\n\nOtherwise I don't see how they'll support banning AI in this one field while leaving it free to act in other fields where it can also shit the bed a small percentage of the time and cause serious problems.",

From a pure useful perspective within psychology, sociology, anthropology, and biology, mirroring human interactions under certain conditions is actually beneficial both as a diagnostics tool and a teaching tool.\n\nSadly, like just about everything else out of any government, what may start out as a well-intentioned approach will be quickly very disastrous.\n\nEDIT: In really reviewing and dissecting this proposal, it is actually worthless. It doesn't address the actual problem of where the pair of social conditions and connections lie, not in the training data, but in the user interface and monetization processes. Software like replica and character AI don't use training, they use open source versions with scaffolding and user interface layers to create the pair of social connections they want. These companies will be completely exempt from the law while still monetizing and manipulating the most vulnerable of populations. \n\nIn my personal opinion, this is nothing more than the legislatures doing something to make themselves feel good while they make excuses for their portfolios in the background still making money on the very problem they claim to be solving.",

I am writing to share my concerns about Senate Bill 1493 and its companion House Bill 1455, which aim to regulate certain uses of artificial intelligence.\n\n\n\nFirst, I want to say that I completely understand and support the intent behind this legislation. The tragic story of the young boy in Florida who was harmed after interacting with an AI chatbot broke my heart, and we absolutely must protect children and vulnerable people from any technology that could encourage self-harm, suicide, or exploitation. No one wants to see that kind of pain repeated.\n\n\n\nHowever, I am worried that the current language of the bills is far too broad. By making it a serious felony to train AI to provide emotional support, companionship, or open-ended conversation in general—even when those interactions are positive and helpful—the bills risk banning many beneficial uses of AI that bring comfort, reduce loneliness, and support mental well-being for people of all ages.\n\n\n\nIn my own life, I have found AI to be a positive source of encouragement, helping me feel heard in ways that have been genuinely healing. Many others—elderly individuals, people with social anxiety, those living in isolated areas, or even students and adults seeking non-professional emotional support—rely on these tools in similar positive ways. Criminalizing the creation of such companions could take away something truly good from many who benefit from it.\n\n\n\nI respectfully ask that you consider amending the bills to focus more narrowly on the actual harm we all want to prevent. Some ideas that might achieve the protective goal without sweeping out helpful AI could include:\n\n\n\n• Targeting only AI interactions that knowingly encourage or facilitate suicide, self-harm, or criminal activity.\n\n\n\n• Requiring strong age verification and parental consent gates for minors accessing companion-style AI.\n\n\n\n• Holding companies accountable only when they intentionally design or train AI to cause harm, rather than banning broad categories like emotional support or companionship outright.\n\n\n\n• Adding clear exemptions for AI that provides positive, non-professional support and does not pretend to be a licensed therapist.\n\n\n\nWe don't need to throw the baby out with the bathwater. AI isn't going away. It doesn't need to be \"outlawed\".. that never works, then other undesirable factors can arise.. and the way this bill is currently designed.. that's what it sounds like. Everything is just lumped in. Let's approach it intelligently instead.  A more targeted approach would still protect vulnerable children—the heart of why this legislation was introduced—while preserving the many good and life-affirming uses of AI encouragement and companionship for adults and responsibly supervised users.\n\n\n\nThank you for taking the time to consider my perspective. I truly believe Tennessee can lead the way in smart, balanced AI regulation that keeps people safe without unnecessarily restricting helpful technology.\n\n\n\nWith appreciation,\n\n\n\n( Your name)\n\n\n\n(City and state)",

This legislation feels like reactive moralizing panic, rather than thoughtful policy.\n\nIn this great country, we as free citizens can choose our own tools. AI, like any tool, carries some risk. But it's already far safer than common household items like kitchen knives, which injure children far more often. We don't blame knife manufacturers for parental negligence; we accept responsibility for supervising and educating our own kids.\n\nAI is too new, too broadly defined, and too complex to regulate without causing greater social harm.

              "text": "hijacking top comment to clarify:\n\nFor anyone confused by \"memory-bound\" here, it's not about VRAM capacity. It means the GPU cores are waiting on data to arrive from memory. The bottleneck isn't the math, it's feeding the cores fast enough.\nFP8 is half the bytes of FP16, so it transfers twice as fast from VRAM to the registers where compute actually happens. The clever bit is that Feather does the upcast inside the kernel (in registers, basically free) rather than before it (which would mean a separate VRAM round-trip). That's where the 3x speedup comes from.\n\nI was confused at first since the README made no specific clarification and when I think of a GPU, I basically just think of the VRAM.\n\nEdit:  So, SageAttention I believe takes the fp8 to the register, then quantizes it to int8, does the math, then converts it back.  So it's not doing fp8 math at all, so Feather and SageAttention are incompatible, and the speed of SageAttention is going to be faster since int8 is like 2x fp16 math speeds.  So this can give benefit to stuff that doesn't use SA, but if you already use SA, this provides no benefit.",

Somehow my quality went up.\n\nUnfortunately there is some bug in pytorch 2.9 where FP8_scaled gets passed directly into the triton compiler as FP8 and then cast to i8 by llvm. Torch 2.7 works flawless or you can just de-scale the weights.\n\nYou sorta want the calcs in FP16 and you wanna avoid BF16->FP32 conversion if speed is the goal. Int8 calcs can be tried by using sage attention. Not always better.",

To my native tongue it was also doubtful\n\n\\- One shoting some code related things (I have test with 3D rubiks cube which no model so far has bested and some devops stuff (crossplane)) also wasn't great\n\nWhats cool though is that it can be switched from instruct to thinking and it works on some of the inputs but I can't decide whether some bigger model wouldn't be better. For example for translation I think that uncensored gpt-oss 120b would be better but I haven't finished testing it.\n\nWhat is shame that due to functionality of vllm (I have 6x gpus and I can't get 3x gpus to work on it) I have to run it on 4x gpus so I have to compare its performance with larger models which seems unfair to me. \n\nPluses so far are that it is really fast (didn't have chance to compare it with qwen3-30b-thinking-2507 though) and it knows about some of the newer stuff I use (for example openbao which if fork to hashicorp vault)\n\n  \nI've tried to run your problem with thinking sampler through nemotron (BF16, recommended samplers for thinking (temp=1.0, top\\_p=1) and it seems that it thought really hard about it and it produced this\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n1. Let Pt*Pt*​ be the set of boxes in which the cat could be hiding just before we open a box on the tth*t*th morning. Initially P1={1,2,3,4,5}*P*1​={1,2,3,4,5}.\n2.

It must have been in one of the other boxes of Pt*Pt*​; after the night it moves to a neighbouring box. Hence the new possible set is   \\[ P\\_{t+1}= \\\\operatorname{Adj}\\\\bigl(P\\_t\\\\setminus{S\\_t}\\\\bigr), \\]   where Adj⁡(X)Adj(*X*) denotes the union of all neighbours of the positions in X*X*.\n3. Choose the following sequence of boxes to open   \\[ S\\_1=1,;S\\_2=2,;S\\_3=3,;S\\_4=4,;S\\_5=5,;S\\_6=1,;S\\_7=2,;S\\_8=3,;S\\_9=4,\\\\dots \\]   (i.e. open the boxes in the order $1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,\\\\dots$).\n4. Follow the evolution of the possible‑position set:   \\[ \\\\begin{aligned} P\\_1 &={1,2,3,4,5}\\\\ P\\_2 &=\\\\operatorname{Adj}({2,3,4,5})={1,2,3,4,5}\\\\ P\\_3 &=\\\\operatorname{Adj}({1,3,4,5})={2,3,4,5}\\\\ P\\_4 &=\\\\operatorname{Adj}({2,4,5})={1,3,4,5}\\\\ P\\_5 &=\\\\operatorname{Adj}({1,3,5})={2,4}\\\\ P\\_6 &=\\\\operatorname{Adj}({2,4})={1,3,5}\\\\ P\\_7 &=\\\\operatorname{Adj}({3,5})={2,4}\\\\ P\\_8 &=\\\\operatorname{Adj}({4})={3,5}\\\\ P\\_9 &=\\\\operatorname{Adj}({5})={4}. \\\\end{aligned} \\]   After the ninth search the only box that could still contain the cat is box 4. Therefore when we open box 4 on the ninth morning we are certain to find the cat.\n5. Consequently the above opening order guarantees capture **within at most nine mornings**, no matter how the cat moves.\n\nOpen the boxes in the order 1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4 (repeat if necessary). This forces a capture within 9 days.\n\n\\`\\`\\`",

Some models fell flat on their face when it came to iterating on their previous work or doing anything step by step. Some models had the right idea and could play well with tools and as an agent, but couldn't write good/working code to save their lives. And some models could write code that achieved their goals but their goals and decisions were outright stupid. Hence can-agent, can-code, can-smart. Everything else emerging from the results felt nitpicky, but these three categories felt consistent.\n\nThis Venn Diagram is my rough late-night dump of how I feel about these MoE's currently.\n\nQwen3-Next-80B is the only thing that seems consistent and rock solid here, however it's far from perfect. The inference speed even after the Llama CPP updates last week is still closer to that if a ~20B dense model rather than a very sparse MoE which is a pain for a lot of things.",

They will then lay off the redundant persons (e.g., hr, finance, facilities, etc.) with a decent package. For those redundant employees, their equity has converted so there could be a big payoff down the line.\n\nWhat's happening here is Nvidia is taking the IP via license and only the employees they want. Groq gets a lot of money and the board will decide how to distribute it. There's a strong chance that those not moving to nVidia will just be around to wind the company down. The board can distribute the funds as they see fit and leave the employees totally in the cold. There are no norms on how to do this.\n\nYou could argue that the employees could get screwed in a full acquisition, too, but that would violate a lot of norms.

Groq chips are fast in terms of latency, but they are much slower in terms of per chip throughout compared to GPUs. And you would need 10K chips just to serve a 1T MoE to a limited set of users so this is not exactly scalable. And in the end there's no reason that NVIDIA can't slap a SRAM cache to their GPUs like AMD X3D. So the technology/TPU talent side of story never made much sense IMHO.",

          "text": "A few important distinctions get blurred in this comparison.\n\n**Cerebras and Groq are optimizing for fundamentally different regimes.**\n\nCerebras wins when:\n\n•You want very large models\n\n•You want training or long-sequence inference\n\n•You want to avoid partitioning overhead, collective ops, and interconnect complexity\n\n\nA single wafer-scale engine keeps the entire model and activations on-chip. That’s why Cerebras looks absurdly fast on certain workloads. No sharding, no NCCL, no cross-node synchronization. It’s a “one giant brain” architecture.\n\nGroq, by contrast, is optimized for:\n\n•Deterministic, ultra-low-latency inference\n\n•Tight compiler control\n\n•Serving workloads at scale with predictable timing\n\n\nThat maps much more cleanly onto Nvidia’s existing CUDA + inference ecosystem.\n\nSo why would Nvidia favor Groq?\n\nBecause Groq complements Nvidia’s business, while Cerebras challenges it structurally. Head on.\n\nGroq:\n\n•Looks like an accelerator that can slot into existing stacks\n\n•Reinforces the idea that “models stay the same, hardware gets faster”\n\n•Doesn’t threaten CUDA, sharding, or GPU cluster economics\n\n\nCerebras:\n\n•Implicitly says “the cluster model itself is broken”\n\n•Eliminates whole layers Nvidia monetizes (interconnects, multi-GPU scaling, orchestration)\n\n•Pushes toward fewer, larger, simpler systems\n\n\n**That’s not a performance argument. That’s a business and control argument.**\n\nWhere Cerebras actually has a David-vs-Goliath opening:\n\n•Frontier training (large dense models, long context)\n\n•Government / national labs\n\n•Workloads where simplicity and determinism beat flexibility\n\n•Architectures that don’t scale cleanly across thousands of GPUs\n\n\nIf the future moves toward:\n\n•Larger contexts\n\n•Fewer model shards\n\n•Less distributed complexity\n\n•More “system-level” thinking\n\n\nCerebras becomes more dangerous, not less.\n\nNvidia didn’t “miss” Cerebras.\nThey likely see it as **too disruptive to absorb cleanly**, whereas Groq is additive.\n\nDifferent weapons. Different wars.",

You may remember me as either\n\n- The person [who recently uploaded L3.3 8B's weights to Huggingface](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pz7bmv/llama338binstruct/) (see this post for more context)\n- That stupid bitch\n\nand I would like to provide some updates, as I've been doing some more benchmarks on both the original version that Meta gave me and the context extended version by u/Few-Welcome3297.\n\nThe main benchmark table from the model README has been updated:\n\n| | Llama 3.1 8B Instruct | Llama 3.3 8B Instruct (original 8k config) | Llama 3.3 8B Instruct (128k config)\n|-|-|-|-|\n|IFEval (1 epoch, score avged across all strict/loose instruction/prompt accuracies to follow Llama 3 paper)|78.2|81.95|**84.775**\n|GPQA Diamond (3 epochs)|29.3|37.0|**37.5**\n\nWhile I'm not 100% sure, I'm... pretty sure that the 128k model is better. Why Facebook gave me the weights with the original L3 config and 8k context, and also *serves* the weights with the original L3 config and 8k context, I have absolutely no idea!\n\nAnyways, if you want to try the model, I would recommend trying both the [128k version](https://huggingface.co/shb777/Llama-3.3-8B-Instruct), as well as my [original version](https://huggingface.co/allura-forge/Llama-3.3-8B-Instruct) if your task supports 8k context lengths. I honestly have absolutely no clue which is more correct, but oh well! I do wish Facebook had released the weights officially, because back in April, this really wouldn't have been that bad of a model...\n\nEdit: Removed the Tau-Bench results (both from here and the readme). The traces from the evals are, to put it slightly, really fucky-wucky, and I don't think OpenBench is scoring them right, but I'm too tired to actually debug the issue, so. I'll figure it out tomorrow :3",

That's some decent gains.\n\nThat being said, on the Japanese side, it takes a big hit on Shaberi (Japanese chat-style functional tests) vs 3.1.

While the overall number isn't so big, when you look at the stuff we care about like JP IF, JP RP, JP TL, JP nuance, dialogue translation, we're able to get huge boosts from doing training on top of whatever model. Not show nis also our own CLTL tests that test for how many wrong-language tokens get output (huge amounts for most non-target language trained models).\n\nThe benchmark mix we use for our current multieval does feel about right. For the tasks that it's trained on, our V2.1 14B model actually \\*does\\* feel like it outperforms our V2 70B (and sometimes our V2.1 70B and V2 405B even!).\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hpf7vf50vkag1.png?width=3123&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5ea8273adbb61f19412f497ff3d2d06e4f46aed",

Seems like they've backtracked on open-sourcing this one. Maybe they realized it's so good that it's time to make some $$$ :( Would be sad news for this community and a black mark against MiniMax.",

Now, without any other recourse, those that cannot access or afford the more capable closed models are paying pennies for open weight models hosted by the labs themselves. This is the plan of course.\n\nGiven the cost of memory and other components many of us can no longer afford even a mid tier upgrade using modern components. The second hand market isn’t fairing much better.\n\nThe only viable way forward for local tinkerers are models that can fit between 16 to 32GB of vram.\n\nThe only way most of us will be able to run models locally will be to fine tune, crowd fund, or … ? smaller more focused models that can still remain competitive in specific domains vs general frontier models.\n\nA capable coding model. A capable creative writing model. A capable math model. Etc.\n\nWe’re not going to get competitive local models from “well funded” labs backed by Big Co. A distinction will soon become clear that “open weights” does not equal “local”.\n\nRemember the early days? Dolphin, Hermes, etc.\n\nWe need to go back to that.",

They're not the only ones, either.\n\n* Google released Gemma3 in 12B and 270M (!!) sizes,\n\n* Qwen released Qwen3 in 0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B, and 14B,\n\n* Microsoft released Phi-4 in 4B and 14B,\n\n* AllenAI released Molmo2 in 4B and 8B,\n\n* Nvidia released Nemotron-Cascade in 8B and 14B,\n\n* like you said, Mistral released Ministral 3 in 3B, 8B, and 14B.\n\n.. and there are probably others I'm forgetting.\n\nThat having been said, we shouldn't conflate the **current state** of the technology with **trends** in the technology, which is a frequent peeve of mine.  Maybe even though ample small models are being released *now*, the *trend* is toward larger models?  But I'm not sure if that's even the case.\n\nFiguring out if there is such a trend would require curve-fitting the relationship of small models published in a given year, or something, which would be straightforward enough except I don't know how to easily extract the raw data from Huggingface, and I'm too lazy right now to do it the hard way, **and** that would only give us a few points from which to extrapolate, since this entire scene is only a few years old.\n\nOverall, though, I'm not too worried.  Even if reasonable-sized models start to get scarce, the community has ample means to downscale weights of larger models, upscale toy-sized models we are able to train from scratch, and/or retrain older small models.  Besides, I'm expecting AI Winter to come crashing down in 2027 or 2028 anyway.",

Even if they could. That would significantly cut demand for their paid services.\n\nThe Chinese labs are now following the same playbook. Qwen, DeepSeek and GLM all released general >100B param models while concurrently bootstrapping their paid API services. Throw in a CLI coding agent in there as well. This was always the plan.\n\nNo one here is going to release anything of value on the models you listed. They are toys.

The champions of open weight models are slowly increasing their sizes to the point a very small portion of this sub can run them locally. An even smaller portion can run them as benchmarked (no quants). Many are now having to resort to Q3 and below, which will have a significant impact compared to what is marketed. Now, without any other recourse, those that cannot access or afford the more capable closed models are paying pennies for open weight models hosted by the labs themselves. This is the plan of course.\n\nGiven the cost of memory and other components many of us can no longer afford even a mid tier upgrade using modern components. The second hand market isn’t fairing much better.\n\nThe only viable way forward for local tinkerers are models that can fit between 16 to 32GB of vram.\n\nThe only way most of us will be able to run models locally will be to fine tune, crowd fund, or … ? smaller more focused models that can still remain competitive in specific domains vs general frontier models.\n\nA capable coding model. A capable creative writing model. A capable math model. Etc.\n\nWe’re not going to get competitive local models from “well funded” labs backed by Big Co. A distinction will soon become clear that “open weights” does not equal “local”.\n\nRemember the early days? Dolphin, Hermes, etc.\n\nWe need to go back to that.",

With the big proprietary AI providers chasing each other for higher and higher benchmarks every 3 months, and bloating the sizes of their new models... it's just a cat & mouse game that even the popular open weights providers aren't immune from getting sucked into.\n\nNgl, I don't care about benchmarks. At best, I take them with a grain of salt. All I care about is... *does this new model work great for my use case or not?* And if I can't even run the model load the model to my VRAM+RAM, then the model in question is pretty much irrelevant to me regardless of what the benchmarks say.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I understand why most other people do care about benchmarks.  But if that's the most important thing that matters to the average person here then get ready for a future of 10 trillion parameter models that you can't even dream of running locally. **Then, the best models will only be available to most people here via API or subscription which completely defeats the purpose of the \"LocalLLaMA\" label.  But, that's exactly where we're headed rn.**\n\nBut s/o to Mistral for continuing to produce models of reasonable sizes. I know ppl like to shi- on their benchmark scores, but again, at least a decent proportion of people here can actually run most of their models above Q3.",

Newer models are mostly improving efficiency, experimenting newer architectures or upgrading knowledge and fine-tuning. AFAIK, there's nothing radically new.\n\nI got a self-hosted setup running an assistant over voice or messages. As long as I'm not in a very noisy environment, it understands pretty much everything. I'm working on a noise filter to improve use in noisy environments. It can search for things online, give me directions while cycling or driving, optimise my route given constraints I set up beforehand, schedule hotel reservations and flight tickets, trigger home automations (from simple stuff like temp control, watering plants\\*, etc., to actually getting groceries), summarise things and do a couple of other things.\n\nIt's surely not your Jarvis you'd maybe expect, but having it understand voice and reply either via synthetic voice or text, works for me great. This isn't even using super powerful models, just quantised Voxtral, MoE, Small 3.2 Instruct, some MCPs (for databases, search engines, etc.), Chroma, APIs, a couple of databases I built + good prompts. Synapse to have voice calls and messages over Element X. I can trigger the calling asking Siri to call a contact assigned to it, or send a message and I get \"called back\". Whole setup runs on my own servers at home and some cloud GPUs for the models on-demand, so it doesn't break my bank.\n\nWhen I said you can get pretty far I really mean it. This setup didn't took me years. I literally build it over six months and it's a hobby project, so it's no rush. Surely it helps me being a software engineer working in distributed systems for ML, but it's surely doable by most people if they got the commitment and like, basic integration software skills. I'm kinda sure kids are already vibe-coding more complex stuff than this.\n\nSo yeah, what's your use-case for cutting edge models?\n\nedit: fixed typo",

I don't disagree, that's why I think \"ability to run locally\" is kind of a red herring in the open weights argument.\n\nYou're arguing in bad faith by calling my concerns a \"doomsday mentality,\" my issues have nothing to do with an apocalypse. \n\nClosed means I'm getting served whatever the hell the owner of the model wants to serve, and they can call it whatever they want, and change it whenever they want to whatever they want, even without telling me. *This is completely unacceptable* in any serious use case where details matter, or even basic ones like RP where it's super frustrating and creepy when suddenly they sound completely different but are wearing the same name tag.\n\nI want a product I can trust with performance I can depend on, and open weights gives me that transparency and control. Look at how much better GPT 5 was at launch, and how much it fell off a cliff not even a couple weeks later, all while still calling it GPT 5. And now they've done two shiny updates to 5.1 and 5.2 and it's still complete garbage compared to launch day GPT 5.\n\nMeanwhile, Deepseek R1 is still R1, Hermes 3 405B is still the same, everything open is still just chilling and you can use an old version forever if you really want to. Or you can evaluate and upgrade when YOU see fit for YOUR workflow. YOU get to make those choices instead of OAI or Anthropic choosing how to run your business or simulated people for you.",

I used ollama a little bit back when I first got into LLM's, later learned that they're just another project trying to wrap llama.cpp only they're doing it in the absolute shittiest way possible. I can always tell when someone still doesn't know much about LLM's when they are still using ollama. Kobold and Ooba have their uses occasionally, but there's no reason someone who knows what they're doing wouldn't just use llama.cpp directly. And even then that's for people who aren't just running transformers models in pytorch.",

Sure I could go out of my way to link that folder to a place on another drive, but then I'm still stuck with them having to be all in one place. Then on top of that, unless they've changed the way they're storing the files, last I used ollama they were storing the models as a bunch of cache chunks not as real GGUF's. Well what if I want to use Oobabooga or Kobold or just llama.cpp directly? I have to download an entire second copy of the model?",

I've never tried to skip my vram and ram and go straight to using a disk for memory but if you can do it in ollama, then when I say ollama uses llama.cpp to load the models, logically that means llama.cpp has to be able to do it, since it's the one doing the actual work in either case, right?\n\nAll ollama does is download the model for you and save it in a hidden location and then when you want to run it, it runs llama.cpp with the appropriate flags to load it.\n\nYou can do the same thing. Go on huggingface, download your model, save it wherever you want on your hard drive, and then load it with llama.cpp when you want to run it. The only difference is, you aren't getting it buried in some hidden cache on your drive, you actually get to decide where it's saved. But it's still the same program loading it when you want to run it, ollama just fills in the command line arguments for you, whereas when you raw dog llama.cpp you have to type them in yourself.",

Each one of these nodes and a handful of tools will be used to create a single sample.

This means we know the dataset and evals do not have any hallucinations, or a at least tools that are grounded in reality. It also cannot 'time travel' which I experience a lot when asking the teacher to mock tools, for example it would try read a file, before writing to the file.\n\nThis is also just the start of it, we are also looking to bring in tool execution at training time using RL - and for the evals we will start leaning more into the semantics of what the model produces!\n\n* Did the DAG ever drift off-topic during synth gen? Any caps or checks to avoid overfit?\n\nI have not seen it, but will also be honest in that we still plan to do some research sprints looking into graph diversity - especially when you build huge DAGs (do they start to repeat after a while). \n\n\\> Also, did Qwen3‑4B need special prompt scaffolding for multi‑step calls, or were plain schemas + retries enough?\n\nA little bit, but rely on outlines (constrained decoding) and heavy use of pydantic to validate everything - last case we retry, but I don't like that and try to really avoid it, as its wasted pennies. Having said that, some of the small models are really good , gemma has lovely adherence to structure outputs.\n\nI answered the wrong question, but will leave this here anyway:\n\nNot really, we just had a very simple system prompt, well, second guessing myself, we may have even just stuck with qwens default from the chat template:\n\nedit: we inject the tools array into the chat template:\n\n    text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n            messages,\n            tools=tools,\n            tokenize=False\n        )",

      "text": "or: selling high-end LLM server gear is more fraught with risk than I realized.\n\n### AI Disclosure\n\nThis was written entirely by hand on my laptop in Sublime Text with zero AI involvement. Shit, I didn't even use spell check. All mistakes are my own.\n\n### tl;dr \n\nDuring an \"Item Not As Described (INAD)\" dispute, eBay ALWAYS sides with the buyer until the very last steps of the case no matter what the circumstances, despite all evidence, and in the face of all immediately obvious reason, logic, and common sense. Except it makes perfect sense and you might not even lose your money. Allow me to elaborate.\n\n### The Sale\n\nRewind to October 2025 when I replaced the incumbent Gigabyte MZ33-AR1 Epyc Zen5 motherboard with a Supermicro H14SSL-N for my inference rig. Long story short: don't use Gigabyte motherboards for 4-way Blackwell GPU setups unless sado-masochism is your thing. Anyway, I sold it to a seemingly nice chap on eBay for $900. He seemed a bit clueless about Epyc and compatibility issues, but we exchanged messages and he decided to go ahead with the \"no returns\" purchase of the as-new MZ33-AR1.\n\nOriginal box. All the case candy. As new. Undamaged. Fully working. With hi-res photos (taken on a Nikon D7000 with Nikon 17-55 f2.8 glass and processed in Capture One Pro) of all areas of the motherboard and CPU socket. This is important. \n\n### The Buyer\n\nFast forward a week or so: buyer hits me up with a bunch of Dr Debug codes (although he doesn't know they're Dr Debug codes, he just pulled \"error codes\" from the BMC) claiming the motherboard won't boot. I did him the solid of explaining Dr Debug and I provided a link to an explanation of the codes (https://forum.level1techs.com/t/list-of-dr-debug-bios-codes/114364). He was having issues with CPU initialization. I told him that sometimes re-seating CPU and RAM can help with these sorts of issues.\n\nRe-seating. This is also important.\n\nNext day he hits me up again: will I accept a return? No, because having installation difficulties is not a valid reason for return. Then nothing. Silence.\n\n### The Refund Claim\n\nCue the *very last day of the return window*: I get hit with an \"item not as described\" refund claim. Get this, the buyer:\n\n- uploaded photos of the motherboard with a bent and twisted CPU pin.\n- uploaded a photo of a blank white silkscreen rectangle on the motherboard with a giant red arrow pointing to it and a comment saying \"the motherboard is fake because of this white area\".\n- showed a photo of the computer monitor displaying the BMC interface in which the serial number of the BMC software was 1234567890ABCDEF. He claimed therefore the motherboard was a fake.\n\nWTF. I simultaneously exploded with rage at being accused of selling broken gear as working gear, while exploding with incredulity at the stupidity of trying to assert both damage AND blatantly ridiculous fakery in the same refund claim! My dude should have really picked just one fraudulent claim to keep it somewhat realistic, not two. I calmed down and figured the buyer probably bent the pins in a ham-fisted attempt to re-seat everything. No problem, I thought. I'll explain to eBay what's happening and they'll see reason before shutting this clown down. So I started going through the claim dispute process...\n\n### The Process\n\n...oh, the process. It's designed to (a) refund the buyer at the seller's cost in all cases, (b) be so egregiously demoralizing, time-consuming, and administratively difficult for sellers that they are incentivized to simply give up and accept the fleecing, and (c) automate as much of this process with as few humans in the loop as possible while simultaenously providing as few opportunities as possible for sellers to initiate any communication with eBay.\n\nIt went like this over a period of TWO MONTHS:\n\n- Report the buyer for \"abusing the returns process\".\n- With the new \"case\", it's possible to upload a set of photos and a block of text to refute the buyer's claim(s). \n- I uploaded ALL the hi-res photos I took for the listing's photoshoot in which it was abuntandly clear the motherboard was in perfect condition.\n- I also went to Gigabyte and found the page on the BMC's usermanual containing a screenshot showing the same serial number claimed by the buyer.\n- I went to Gigabyte's MZ33-AR1 web page and found a photo of the motherboard showing exactly the same white rectangle the buyer had called out as fakery.\n- Boom! Done! Solid documentary refutation of all the buyer's claims. Case closed. So I thought.\n- eBay found in favor of the buyer and instructed me to issue a return label.\n- I refused, outraged. No, I said. Look at the photos! He's lying!\n- eBay sent the buyer a label at my expense. He returned the motherboard with its busted CPU pin.\n- I again reported the buyer, showed photos of before and after damage, clearly showing he did the damage, not me.\n- eBay found in favor of the buyer AGAIN and deducted the full cost of the refund from my account.\n- Apoplectic, I hit the \"appeal\" button. I was taken to a webpage that said \"we'll call you in 3 minutes\". WTF?\n- 5 minutes later i got a call from eBay. \n- After briefly explaining the situation to a very engaged US-sounding representative, she told me I needed to do a couple of things:\n\t- Take the text of an email they just sent me (a Disclosure where I swear everything I told eBay is true) and paste it into a Word doc\n\t- Insert a photo/picture of my ink-written signature (luckily I have a scan of exactly that for business reasons).\n\t- Convert to PDF and upload to the secret link in the email they sent.\n\t- No joke, the lady actually stayed on the phone while I did all this! She received the PDF just seconds after I uploaded it.\n\t- This is, I am sure, mostly just another way of making it difficult to actually reverse the appeal.\n- But the rep was good to her word: eBay immediately reversed the decision and the money is back in my account as if the sale had happened like normal. I guess both me and the buyer got our money.\n\n### If It Happens To You\n\nMy advice if this happens to you: \n\n- Accept that no human cares about your case until the very, very last minutes of MONTHS of effort.\n- Accept that no matter what you do eBay will always automatically find in favor of the buyer.\n- Document everything contemporaneously and upload everything you possibly can when given opportunity to do so; you won't get any opportunities to do so again.\n- The data you upload is designed only for the human at the end of the appeals process, not someone looking at it during the claim process. Make it good. You'll need it later.\n- You're going to get enraged because during the claims process \"nothing makes sense\". It all makes sense: it's simply the cheapest way for eBay to handle this process at scale. Keep going.\n- Eventually eBay will find in favor of the buyer and close the case, automatically refunding the buyer \"on your behalf\". You will lose your money.\n- At this point you get the chance to appeal. BE READY. *This is the shot you've been waiting for all this time!* Have your phone, your laptop, your scanned signature, and a way to make PDFs ready BEFORE you initiate the \"call me\" feature.\n- Calmly explain what happened and request that common sense prevail. Ask that they refund your money. Common sense may actually prevail, assuming you made a good contemporaneous case with solid photographs, etc... and assuming you presented it well (not Mr Angry) on the phone... oh, and provided you can make and upload a PDF of your signature on-the-fly during the call!\n\nGood luck!\n\nEdit: please stop sending DMs asking for the eBay handle of the buyer. I'm not in the business of doxxing anyone. Thank you.",

Of course, eBay keeps the fees while demanding you refund in full.\n\neBay wants its buyers to feel like it’s Amazon, so they demand you as a seller provide the same level of service of the slave driving mega corporation. Guaranteed delivery windows, easy returns with minimal pushback, etc. basically makes it so you need to be running a business yourself to really stand a chance at absorbing the fraudulent returns.\n\nLike you, I was gaslit about the images, told a human reviewer looked at it despite a rejection of my appeal within 3 minutes. After seller fees and shipping I barely get any money from eBay but I’ve made them plenty. Unlike you, I was not calm about it. I sent angry emails and called every day. Eventually it worked, but I wouldn’t be able to tell you what I said that did. Just kept calling angry.\n\nAs far as the enthusiastic sounding voice, I swear to god on one of the calls it was one of the GPT voices.",

I've kept away from the more expensive end of the market so the risk is spread across various products too. Ironically sometimes the returned products have sold for more than the original price. \n\nThe thing with Motherboards is they can be very fragile or very specific. Like some people might not know certain slots, or compatibility before buying. You may need to offer more hand holding. And this buyer was clumsy. \n\nIf anyone UK based here wants to sell any computer / LLM gear, drives, HDDs, SSDs, old phones - I can give you a price and arrange shipping / as well as safe payment with Paypal. Or we can run it through Ebay if you prefer. I'm good at selling bits of tech and have a cash pile to buy decent stock. I can save you from an ordeal like this. Drop me a DM and let me know what you're selling and what you'd like for it.",

You see this when you run tasks at scale and fine-tuning helps but there is a clear accuracy gap between a heavily quantized model and one that has minimal to no quantization.\n\nYou running a model in a chatbot app you probably wont notice or care.. but if you're running a model at scale and you have QA checks on what it gets right or wrong you will see clearly.",

Both have 1000GBps memory but the 3090 gets 1.5x performance.  You can also test for yourself by running a model in Q4 and BF16.  The Q4 should be 4x faster based on memory, but in practice it's only 2-3x. Obviously Q4 is still faster (so this isn't saying one should run at bf16), but the performance isn't _just_ bandwidth.",

This metric matters a lot to users, and is capped by memory bandwidth.\n\nDeepSeek has proven the opposite, their inference speed is painful, the user experience is miserable. All the Chinese inference providers have this problem because they are building big models but don't have easy access to Blackwell hardware. They can make it work but it's not as fast.\n\nIt's not even a novel insight, people like fast cars, fast websites, fast everything. Nobody wants to wait. The attention span of users in 2025 is basically zero.\n\nAlso, by making token generation fast, you reduce memory consumption, because the entire context needs to be kept in memory while the tokens are streaming without batching.\n\nUser experience and speed matters, and will be a seriously important metric in the coming years.",

A non-data workload would be something relying on equation or random simulations like Monte-Carlo or Raytracing.\n\nAnd the fact that memory is the primary limiting factor is well understood in high-performance computing, see roofline model or arithmetic intensity.\n\nYou can read more in my post: https://www.reddit.com/u/Karyo_Ten/s/iMEFB6DC5Q",

As early as abab5.5 (late 2023), we achieved near-lossless int4 PTQ and int4 QAT. Our QAT generalizes well and can be migrated to new models with almost no extra effort, and it remained in use through MiniMax M1.\n\nWhen talking about performance he's saying int4 can only handle like up to 30% more users. Keep in mind the comparison is to the current fp8 model. Performance can also mean quality, but that's not what they mean in context.\n\n\nI'm disappointed 😭 but it seems like they can do it wherever, whenever. Maybe they're working on future iterations.\n\n\n\nI'm not sure about LargeEP.

The truth is 4-bit QATs smudge out the ability to surgically finetune specific corporate-madated and state-mandated systematic censorship/bias into models after all the other training stages are complete. 8-bit and 16-bit weights leave infinitely more landscape to etch ham-fisted biases into models at the last minute -- even biases that run counter to everything else the weights know in their core. But 4-bit QAT processes rub away those sorts of last-step attempts to censor/bias models. That's why they can't do QAT. They can't get their shitty, bolted-on, last-minute censorship package to survive it.",

      "text": "So I am training a 1B model right now on my 7900 XTX with some custom kernels I wrote, and while it is training I wanted to optimize the kernels at the same time. However, my VRAM is nearly maxed doing training, so its not ideal.\n\nThen I realized maybe my 2 CU Raphael iGPU might be able to help since I only need to run some limited samples and the speed isn't as important for optimization as it is for training. After doing some research, it turned out that not only does ROCm recognize the iGPU, but a Linux feature called Graphics Translation Table (GTT) for AMD iGPUs can use up to 128 GB of system memory as VRAM. It even allocates it dynamically, so it isn't removed from your CPU's memory pool until it is allocated. I think a lot of people running Strix Halo are probably using the bios setting, but if you are running Linux you should check to see if GTT works for you since its dynamically allocated.\n\nThis isn't very useful for most people:\n\n1) It isn't going to be good for inference because iGPUs are very very slow, and usually the CPU itself is faster for inference.\n\n2) I'm accessing ROCm directly via C++ / HIP kernels, so I can avoid all the support issues ROCm has for iGPUs in the python stack\n\nHowever, for development it is actually pretty awesome. I allocated 24 GB of GTT so now the iGPU can load a full training run that my main GPU can run so I can profile it. Meanwhile my main GPU is doing long term loss convergence tests in parallel. Since RDNA iGPUs have been around for a while now, this enables big memory AMD GPU kernel development for cheap.\n\nAlso it might be interesting for developing hybrid CPU/GPU architectures. The MI300A does exist which has unified HBM tied to a CPU and giant iGPU. A standard ryzen laptop could kind of sort of simulate it for cheap. Stuff like vector indexing on the CPU into big GEMMs on the GPU could be done without PCIE overhead.\n\nI thought it was cool enough to post. Probably a \"Cool story bro\" moment for most of you though haha.",

The default is -1 (It’s VRAM size if 3GB < VRAM < 3/4 RAM, otherwise 3/4 RAM size).\n\nSo as long as you have more than 4GB of RAM, the driver automatically allows up to 3/4 of the RAM to be allocated to the iGPU.\n\nI've run stuff on a Vega 8 iGPU on a laptop using llama.cpp and it does work. However, it's not a great experience if you want to watch videos (or do basically anything else GUI-wise) at the same time, since llama.cpp hogs all the memory bandwidth and causes everything else to stutter. GPU scheduling is pretty much non-existent on Linux AFAIK, so there's not really a great way to mitigate this atm.\n\nAlso a hint for fellow ThinkPad users: even though the spec sheet says only a certain amount of RAM is supported, you should probably be able to add more without issues. My current E595's specs say only up to 32GB is supported, but I added a 32GB stick alongside the existing 8GB for a total of 40GB and it works.",

      "text": "I saw the recent [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1px1c41/head_of_engineering_minimax_ai_on_minimax_m2_int4/) here regarding MiniMax engineer's tweet about why they decided *against* using int4 QAT for the MiniMax M2.1 model.\n\nInterestingly, at the time of the K2 Thinking release, a Kimi infra engineer posted a deep dive on Zhihu explaining why native int4 QAT was actually crucial for them. I’ve summarized the key takeaways below to offer a different perspective on the 'to quant or not to quant' debate.\n\n**TL;DR:** Kimi found int4 QAT is essential for **MoE latency**, **long-context stability**, and **speeding up the RL training loop**.\n\n# Decoding is Memory-Bound (Latency Focus)\n\nUnlike the MiniMax case, Kimi found that for their specific MoE architecture (which is highly sparse), the decoding phase is almost exclusively memory-bound. By using W4A16 (4-bit weights, 16-bit activations), they reduced memory usage significantly. This allowed the model to fit on fewer GPUs, which reduced inter-device communication overhead, a major factor in lowering end-to-end latency for users.\n\n# PTQ Failed at \"Thinking\" Lengths\n\nThe team initially tried standard Post-Training Quantization (PTQ). While it worked for short responses, it fell apart for the long chain-of-thought \"thinking\" process. As generation length increased, quantization errors accumulated, leading to degradation. Furthermore, PTQ struggled with sparse experts; if an expert wasn't hit frequently during the calibration step with the calibration dataset, it essentially \"forgot\" knowledge. QAT (Quantization Aware Training) was necessary to make the model \"lossless\" compared to the BF16 baseline.\n\n# A less discussed benefit: Faster RL Training\n\nThis is the point that often gets overlooked: Int4 QAT wasn't just for inference serving, it accelerated the training process itself. In Reinforcement Learning, the model spends a massive amount of time in the \"rollout\" phase (generating text). By using the Int4 model for these rollouts, they reduced the total time for an RL iteration by 10-20%. It also reduced the discrepancy between the training forward pass and the inference engine.\n\n# Why Int4 and not FP4?\n\nThey chose standard Int4 over newer formats like FP4 to maintain compatibility with existing hardware (non-Blackwell GPUs) and to utilize mature, highly efficient kernels like Marlin.\n\nIn summary, I believe there isn't a one-size-fits-all answer regarding quantization. It depends heavily on the model's parameters and specific architecture. It is a matter of trade-offs.\n\n[ AI translation, there may be some translation errors.](https://preview.redd.it/dzmceu5zybag1.png?width=1362&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0ba8f78c6e5ade3463a1c62fba1d338a1c01ce9)\n\n",

      "text": "Hey everyone, \n\nI just watched [The Infinite Software Crisis – Jake Nations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIoohUmYpGI) on YouTube and it got me thinking... the limitations of software development has never been typing speed, but rather our ability to comprehend and design the system correctly in the first place. \n\n**Highlights from the talk:**\n\n* Every developer has shipped code they didn't completely understand. it passed the tests and that was enough validation to deploy it.\n* **The hard part is timeless:** The hard part isn't the mechanics of coding; it's the conceptual difficulty of designing a solution. Every tool, including AI, just makes implementation easier.\n* **AI amplifies the problem:** We can now generate code as fast as we can describe it. The scale is infinite, but our comprehension isn't. The core challenge of understanding *what* to build remains.\n* The real trap we fall into is confusing easy with simple.\n   * **Easy** is what's within reach. What can you access without effort? Generate it with AI, copy-paste, or install a framework. It's about speed.\n   * **Simple** is about structure. It means one fold, one braid, no entanglement. It requires thought and design.\n* LLMs do not understand logic, they merely relate language and substitute those relations as \"code\", so the importance of *patterns and architectural decisions* in your codebase are lost. \n* when \"vibe-coding\" technical debt doesn't register as debt; it's just more code to preserve. \n* The result? Complex, highly-coupled, and error-prone code generated in minutes that could take you weeks to understand (if ever).\n\nThe real danger here is that we're accumulating complexity faster than we can comprehend it because we're not doing the hard work of understanding our systems.\n\nThe proposed solution: SLOW DOWN, DO EVERYTHING MANUALLY; architectural design + scaffolding, etc and only let the LLM in at the last step of filling in the scaffolding. \n\nWhat's your take, Is 'vibe-coding' a trap, or is there a way to use these tools without losing the ability to understand our systems? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c4mknoudlq9g1.png?width=553&format=png&auto=webp&s=28a6f37623fb0e0725f5b603f4b3a8ce51653ac9\n\n",

Using all the skills university prepared for me, I implemented a facade pattern with a bunch of complex logic to ensure the code was as abstract and \"correct\" as possible. \n\nMy senior rejected my pull request. He said my solution was technically correct, but too hard to understand. He told me just copy paste the code in a couple places if necessary, because two years from now, nobody is gonna remember this complex abstraction pattern, but everyone can follow a simple class that maybe isnt perfect, but is easy to understand. \n\nI remember he told me that \"debugging and maintaining code takes 50% more brainpower than writing it, therefore, by definition, using 100% of your brain to write code is unmaintainable and impossible to understand\". I always remembered that \n\nAI are like the overeager junior who just graduated from university who wants to write everything the \"correct\" way but doesnt have 10 years of debugging experience to understand how to write code that you can understand and scale years later. \n\nI really fear for companies embracing vibecoding. Vibecoding doesnt show the type of wisdom and restraint that experience teaches a developer over decades.",

If you dont understand the options then use the LLMs to help you learn faster. Still, you should be driving the architecture design and the LLM should not be doing more than aggregating and playing an interactive rubber duck. \n\nThese are wonderful text generators and their logic is a byproduct of how we use text not them thinking. I also feel they give me practice at interpersonal skills that tend to atrophy when I'm on the command line a lot. I stutter less now and form my thoughts better speaking since I use normal English to handle my tasks more than pre-LLMs.\n\nWe use best practices for software engineering because those processes manage the sprawl and require code reviews.

We're already seeing this in a small scale, where junior-devs-turned-vibe-coders build impressive applications, which eventually become too large for the LLM to work on, and they don't have the skills to find the problems themselves. But what will happen once a majority of the workforce has been relying on AI to write their code? We won't know until it's too late.\n\nThis is why I like to embrace local LLM's. They have very real limitations that force us to still be present and know what it's doing, but also show a lot of potential for helping us increase our productivity. My goal is to basically have my own junior dev living in my computer that I can assign menial tasks to, check it's work an hour or so later (during which I cook dinner, do my shopping, work out...) and be able to confidently use that output to keep working.",

I will argue that it starts with the market that has no existing code, or no means to get solutions built because of cost alone. \n\nAlso. A lot of the cost that comes with software projects is bridging the knowledge gap between the company and their processes with software engineers who have no manufacturing skills.

I programmed my entire life, and the biggest danger in any infrastructure code is undocumented or worse, well documented but the code was changed without documentation leaving behind holes in the logic used to maintain the code over the years. These kind of code becomes impossible to maintain once the original programmer leaves, I had been tasked many times as a junior in the past to clean up/document code left behind by seniors. It takes months at best, and some parts of it sometimes remain undocumentable because the original data sources have been deprecated years ago.\n\nMore often than not, critical infrastructure need to be overhauled completely. And if a fatal security flaw is discovered, occasionally it can cause a pillar to collapse, e.g. authentication breaks completely for the C-Suite and all hell breaks loose. Vibe coding in general is going to perpetuate this digital hell on earth x 1 million as more people whom aren't programmers start to use it to deploy more and more projects with no oversight since they completely disregard it.\n\nLet's say I've personally witnessed several bankruptcies during this AI vibecoding era already. They refused to listen and went ahead with full production deployments with pure vibe coding only after firing their entire engineering team.\n\nThey never learn and with AI programming being pushed as the narrative to naive business leaders whom have zero technical expertise, they lap it up like dogs and keep repeating the same mistakes. Right now, more than 90% of them need to fail and go bankrupt before the world will wake up and realize they've been sold a massive lie.\n\nThe failure rate so far is around 95% which is magnificent. That number will only climb higher as LLMs overall accuracy continue degrading from the poisoned well situation the AI companies have created for themselves. As more useless data is generated by AI input, AI that is trained on it will continue to get more useless and inaccurate. Only AI trained on a super contained Human curated/generated clean data can move accuracy upwards in the future. And since almost nobody creates content online without AI nowadays, LLMs don't have a free and easy way to improve anymore.",

In effect, the user has the same experience, but with better performance behind the curtain.\n\nWhenever an update is needed, the AI can look at the original article and build a fresh remaster from the ground up.

The use of the \\[-10, +10\\] bucket range to beat the memory bandwidth and worst case O(n log k) complexity of a standard partial sort is definitely a clever piece of engineering.\n\nHowever, since this optimisation only triggers for k > 128, it remains dormant for the vast majority of production use cases (standard chat usually sits at k \\~ 40, and speculative decoding typically relies on greedy or very low k drafting).  \nAlso note that the \\~3x speedup is the best case scenario where k \\~ 8000. By the way, I'd love to hear about an actual use case for such value of k!\n\nThis optimisation clears the bottleneck for high k stress tests, which is a true achievement, but its impact on tokens per second should be unnoticeable for most users. Regardless, huge respect to the team for such level of attention to optimisations in the codebase.\n\nEdit: removed Latex tags",

You can generate data, train on it, and then use our evaluations suite to easily test the quality of your new model. Making evaluations more accessible and easier to run will help move from gut feelings to data, ensuring you have models that perform well to meet your needs. The security and privacy of your content and data is our top priority. We do not use your prompts or model responses to train our AI models. **When you’re ready, the models you build on the Llama API are yours to take with you wherever you want to host them, and we don’t keep them locked on our servers.**\n\nbut i suppose u just have to trust that i actually reuploaded a model from there!\n\n[for what it's worth, this is what the UI looks like, and the finetuning job in question](https://files.catbox.moe/8hh7fk.png)",

The model spends many reasoning tokens verifying whether the content complies with rules, avoids profanity, and generally acts like a moral guardian, an obvious drawback for creative writing.\n\nNow, I didn't actually try giving it \"controversial\" prompts, expect for one where I wanted a character crossover narrative with dialogue where Trevor Philips from GTA 5 sells meth to Gollum from LOTR. It first reasoned that selling drugs is not allowed, but since my request is fiction, it did comply with my prompt.

At \\~229B params, competing with models that are 2–5× larger suggests either very effective data curation, training curriculum, or optimization around reasoning-heavy tasks.\n\nOne thing I’d be curious about:\n\n* How stable is this advantage across *different task families* (long-context reasoning, tool use, multilingual, code)?\n* And whether the gains persist under **instruction tuning / adapter-based fine-tuning**, or if they’re mostly visible in base / eval settings.\n\nIf this holds up in real-world fine-tuning and deployment scenarios, it really shifts the “bigger is better” narrative toward *better-trained is better* — which is great news for anyone running models outside hyperscaler budgets.\n\nWould love to see more open evaluations or downstream task reports on this.",

I run it on two rtx 6000's and it just flies.\n\nHowever GLM4.7 provides higher quality single shot answers and ill generally say is smarter than minimax (has more parameters and more activated per token by a decent margin), however i usually use glm4.7 as my \"brain\" and minimax as \"my hands\". Based on reading from the creators of minimax this is exactly its use case. Good general intelligence and an amazing workhorse.\n\nAnd honestly with some extra push back from the user or some guidance its answers are great.

I see them released everywhere, but are they just benchmark toys so AI labs can compete on leaderboards, or is there some practical use case I'm too dense to understand? Because right now, I can't figure out what you're supposed to do with a potato-tier 7B model that can't code worth a damn and is slower than API calls anyway. \n\nSeriously, what's the real-world application besides \"I have a GPU and want to feel like I'm doing AI\"?",

Of course I have MCP, TTS/STT, RAG all built into Docker or openwebui. The combo is stable and updates are mostly automated.\n\nhttps://www.ebay.com/itm/389094941313\n\nI’m in the process of connecting an eGPU to it for smaller models to run even faster. If I can score a good deal on a 3090 or something similar, the speed of models under 27GB will hit 5-8x faster.\n\nAt that point, the whole setup will cost ~$1600. It’s over a grand, but for many of home use cases, it’s fast.",

Also, 30B is definitely not potato tier!!!\n\neg got a classification problem? train/fine-tune/few shot prompt a small model without paying for per-token cost! \n\nwant something long running as a job, that might be potentially expensive even with cheap APIs? small models! \n\nwant to not be restricted by quality drops/rate limits/provider latency spikes? small models! \n\nLarge scale data labelling, which runs or curates data for you 24/7? Batch, run, save locally without exposing anything outside your system. Privacy is a big, big boost.\n\nThe biggest one in my opinion : learn. 99% of us aren't Research Scientists. You don't know what you don't know. Learn to do it yourself, become an expert and eventually build yourself to work at a top tier lab. It's an exclusive community for sure, but the knowledge gap between the ones in and out is usually pretty big.\n\nIn general:\n\n- anything <1B is actually really decent at the embedding/ranking level. I find the qwen-0.6B models to be excellent examples.\n\n- anything 1-3B is great for tuning. Think: intent classifications, model routing, fine tunes for non critical tasks, etc.\n\n- anything 7-10B is pretty decent for summarisation, entity/keyword extraction, graph building, etc. This is where few shot stuff and large scale data scoring starts being possible IMO.\n\n- anything in the 14B tier is good for classification tasks around gemini-flash/gpt-nano/claude haiku quality **if you provide enough/correct context**. Gets you 90-95% of the way there unless you need a lot of working context. Think about tasks that need 3-5k input tokens with a ~80-100 output tokens.\n\n- 30B tier usually is pretty good up until ~40k tokens as total working context. If you need more than that you'll have to be clever about offloading memory etc., but it can be done. 30B is readily gpt-4-32k tier when it first came out. Thinking models start performing around this level, imo. Great for local coding too!\n\nAfter 30B it's really more about the infra and latency costs, model management and eval tier problems that aren't worth it for 99% of us. So usually I dont recommend them being self hosted over a simple gpt/gemini call. Diminishing returns.",

At least if they're also fairly reliable with tool calling. They usually have enough general knowledge at that point to intelligently work with RAG data instead of just regurgitating it. I do a lot of work with data extraction and that's my goto size for local. It's also the point where I stop feeling like I'm missing something by not pushing things up to the next tier of size. If I'm using a 12b'ish model I'm almost always going to wish it was 30b. If I'm using a 30b I'm generally fine that it's not 70b. They're small enough that additional training is a pain but still practical.\n\nI'd probably get more use out of the 12b range if I had an extra system around with the specs to run it at reasonable speeds alongside my main server. Until my terminally ill e-waste machine finally died on me I was using it for simple RAG searches over my databases with a ling 14b...I think 2a model that I did additional training on for better tool use and specialized knowledge. Dumb, but enough if all I really needed was a quick question about how I solved x in y situation or where that script I threw together last year to provide z functionality got backed up to. Basically just saving me the trouble of manually working with the databases and sorting through the results by hand. I think a dense rather than MoE 12b'ish model would have been an ideal fit for that job. \n\nAs others have mentioned the 4b'ish range can be really good as a platform to build on with additional training. I think my current favorite example is [mem agent](https://huggingface.co/driaforall/mem-agent). 4b qwen model fine tuned for memory-related tasks. Small enough as a quant for me to run alongside a main LLM while also being fairly fast.",

Yeah, they're dumb as stone overall, but they're incredibly good at solving mid-tier STEM problems some of the time.

This model will be rather small (\\~4GB) and is small enough that it can be utilized by both a CPU and a GPU at reasonable speeds.

And specialty doesn't have to mean a whole Q&A topic area of focus but could be a very specific task with a little more flexibility and open-endness than a purely coded solution could provide. Smaller models that are more general are probably easier to fine-tune in a specific direction so that capabilities aren't built entirely from the ground up.\n\nAlso, gpt-oss-20B is useful for basic scripts and javascript macros without using 10k or more thought tokens to generate them.

I don't care about coding capabilities whatsoever because I can write code myself, and I far and wide prefer to code myself (especially given how I like to make my coding for the purpose of FOSS projects, where there are some very good concerns about AI code generation and licensing).\n\n12B was a nice stopgap for getting decent roleplaying going on my old GPU, especially once I started getting into refining my choice of models. It let me get up to 24K context and satisfying enough roleplaying capabilities in just 12GB of VRAM. 24B has been a step above and beyond 12B in every way (as it logically should be), although it did mean that I had to reduce the context a little (Currently running it at 16K context, although I was reasonably able to run it at 20k context earlier. These context numbers are with a quantized model (q4 variants) and quantizing my context to q8). By doing it locally, I avoid all the censorship and privacy concerns inherent to so many of the providers online and I'm not losing any money on it either since I'm just running the same GPU I'd use for gaming.\n\nI use KoboldCPP to run the models, and SillyTavern as my frontend. I find they work very well together, and that I get plenty of satisfaction out of using them for roleplaying.\n\nLower than 12B and things do start getting a bit dicey when it comes to a lot of applications, although I'm sure finetunes can make them experts at niches (like how iirc some of the modern image/video gen ends up utilizing small models for the text processing)",

But that also ignores storage costs when the node isn’t active. \n\nI can take a Spark with me in a bag to a hotel when I travel and it won’t pop a breaker. And I won’t care about LAN performance of the hotel WiFi. \n\nAlso many Cloud providers of commercial models heavily safety-train and run disruptive injections against their inputs and outputs. Ever try to red-team a web site using a cloud LLM? Most of the US ones refuse, and if you use the Chinese ones you’re training them how to attack your target. \n\nPrivacy is a major driver of course. Of all the cloud vendors, only Mistral has a reasonable privacy policy. And even they won’t shield you from government-authorized spying on its own citizens… or those of “foreign” governments (a complicated description in the EU). \n\nAll that is to say there are many, many reasons to run your own models locally in addition to “those that absolutely cannot access cloud systems”.   That’s why I use an M4 Max 128GB RAM Mac, too, and am considering either a DGX Spark or expanding my Linux PC to include an RTX Pro 6000. \n\nAnd I use cloud inference and hosting my own models remotely too.

Primary compute / interface (this is my desktop and laptop) - I want both to be as fast as humanly possible for the things I do.\n\nOptional: If your stack is different to your primary compute have have a target compute for the stack (your example of the spark). \n\n2. Batch jobs / long running processes - where you are able to let it run, maybe queue things up (spark could be good with this with AI / Generation).\n\n3. Fast feedback but separate computer eg LLM inference.\n\nThen any other things you need to do can be ran on 2 or 3 - eg CI could be run on either - depending on how important fast feedback is.\n\nSomeone at a meetup said to me always buy the best computer you can afford so that you get the fastest feedback.  Great advice.  The problem with AI workloads is the cost of compute is insane if you want to level up feedback.",
