          "text": "OK. First thoughts...\n\nBase model voice cloning is... okay? Pretty fast, reasonably accurate. Nothing earthshaking. They did release finetuning code here though: [https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS/tree/main/finetuning](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS/tree/main/finetuning) for single-speaker fine tuning, and I suspect this thing is going to be -amazing- when fine tuned with a good dataset. I might run a finetune on it and try it out.\n\nThe Voice Design model is interesting in that it lets you design a voice, but you can't easily keep the voice or re-use it on the next generation. I suppose you'd have to set up a pipeline where you make a voice in voice design, then use that voice in the base model to voice clone/keep the voice, maybe? If you don't need to re-use the voice and can one-shot something, this lets you get some really unique output. I guess you could do some one shot->voice clone->finetune base->new model outputs in that voice easily and fast, but that's a whole pipeline to build.\n\nThe Custom Voice version of Qwen 3 TTS has some trained voices to use that are burned into the model. Vivian (their English female model) isn't very good. Try Sohee instead (the Korean female - she's better at English). Still feels very 'anime' overall. Don't love the voices.\n\nI'm going to wire it up to a voice to voice pipeline and see how that feels, see what kind of overall time to first audio I can pull off (seems this can hit pretty low latency).",

                  "text": "I never published my full stack, but I've put out a bunch of the little pieces. Basically, until we get a -proper- high quality voice to voice model, it's best to put together pipelines that sandwich a powerful LLM between a speech to text and text to speech model.\n\nLike...\n\nHere's a 1200x realtime speech to text batching server that can handle continuous batching speech input.  \n[https://github.com/Deveraux-Parker/Nvidia\\_parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2-FAST-BATCHING-API-1200x-RTFx](https://github.com/Deveraux-Parker/Nvidia_parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2-FAST-BATCHING-API-1200x-RTFx)\n\nThat's the voice input. Super fast, low latency. Requires very little vram to run, or, you can run it direct in browser on CPU and it's still faster than realtime. This can handle hundreds of simultaneous users if you needed it to.\n\nIf you only need ONE user, you can even run that thing in a web browser using ONNX and get faster than realtime speed on CPU only, leaving your vram for llm work. Here's a simplistic example of parakeet working in a single html page: [https://github.com/Deveraux-Parker/browser\\_parakeet\\_onnx\\_realtime](https://github.com/Deveraux-Parker/browser_parakeet_onnx_realtime)\n\nOr a v3 version if you need other languages: [https://github.com/Deveraux-Parker/Nvidia\\_parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-onnx\\_simple](https://github.com/Deveraux-Parker/Nvidia_parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-onnx_simple)\n\nRight now Parakeet is the way to go, imho, for speech to text. It's the right mix of accurate, fast, low latency, and low CPU cost.\n\nFor speech output, you want low latency but you're going to sacrifice a bit of emotional control to get it. That means high speed text to speech. Your options are things like Kokoro (here's a batching server that can serve 100 people at the same time off a single 4090 in realtime):  \n[https://github.com/Deveraux-Parker/kokoro\\_batch](https://github.com/Deveraux-Parker/kokoro_batch)\n\nKokoro is very lightweight, extremely fast, and reasonably decent voice output. Highly recommended just because it's rock solid and works. Uses very little vram. CPU-only mode is a bit slower than realtime.\n\nA bit more recent is Supertonic.  \n[https://github.com/Deveraux-Parker/supertonic-2-afterburner-fastAPI](https://github.com/Deveraux-Parker/supertonic-2-afterburner-fastAPI)\n\nFast, sounds pretty good, and has some voice cloning abilities. Runs faster than realtime even on CPU. Lightning-fast on GPU and costs very little in terms of resources.\n\nPocketts is also very good. Highly recommended.\n\nFor the LLM, you want speed and personality, and preferably, a non-thinking LLM. Thinking LLMs introduce a lot of latency and delay before you get a response, so you really want to force nothinking and push an instant response. If you're running this whole stack on a single 24gb vram card, you need to size your LLM accordingly. 12b-20b range in 4 bit fits nicely alongside a voice input and output, and can give you realtime voice to voice conversation with extremely low latency (similar to a chatgpt voice experience, minus a bit of the emotional emoting). GLM 4.7 flash is great and you can run it on 24gb vram, but it's going to be tough to run it alongside the full voice stack with decent context length, whereas gpt-oss-20b could serve 100 people simultaneous low latency two-way voice conversations if you wanted to, because it's lightweight enough to hold the whole stack in a single 24gb card.\n\nBear in mind all of this is only necessary because we're a bit early to the party. I expect soon we'll have voice to voice models all-in-one that are at the level of modern high quality LLMs. Still, it might be useful to maintain a stack like this for awhile because in the short-term, the best LLMs are better than the best omni-llms.\n\nPut this together and you can, on a single 4090, run a stack that does voice input->transcribe->LLM->output text->convert to audio->send audio to user at sub-1 second speeds which means conversational AI for the end-user, and with the batching stack, you can literally run voice to voice agents chatting with dozens of people at the same time in realtime with low latency (I've tested up to 100 users or so before latency started creeping in as I mentioned above). Gotta use a good batching LLM to pull that off though (like VLLM+gpt-oss-20b+parakeet+kokoro or something)\n\nMy personal front-end looks almost like a cellphone UI that I can chat with in text or audio that has a full set of tools/image gen/etc all running in a single stack. I might release it sometime.\n\nI will say it IS possible to go further. Higgs AI is very expressive. Zonos can do some crazy things. VibeVoice from Microsoft is extremely good. Trouble with those models is that they're pretty heavy and definitely slower than realtime, so if you're looking for FAST, it's just not there. Quality-wise, though, they feel more \"real\".",

I'd love to contribute, but I don't have much free time and it's not sustainable financially to make this my job.\n\nThis line of thinking is also why so many genuinely great open source projects die. They're often backed by a single dev who doesn't get anything for their work other than angry comments.\n\nI wish the open source ecosystem figured a way to pay devs fairly for their time and efforts. Even better would be the ability to sponsor features collectively, sort of vote for the next feature with our wallets. A lot of projects would be way more sustainable, and less dependent on corporate sponsorships. I'd happy contribute to such a system both financially help sponsor the features that I want, and implement the ones which I find pay a fair compensation for my time.",

Then I added specific tools to help me with my writing- uploaded all of my books into it so I could ask thr chatbot questions  about events and characters. Have it evaluate full manuscripts with specific editong questions -.review this characters arc and look for plotholes. \n\nThen I refined the memory storage, moved from Langchain to Langraph, and used a three tier summary system to summarise the books. Then I created an engineer persona and did the same with the systems source code and made it auto documenting. Then I hooked it into.an ad platform and three sales platforms ao that I could see how various ad campaigns worked and advise me on whether an ad was working and whether to scale it, stop it or just leave for another week. Then I added a visual cortex so it could generate and edit images. Then I automated the royalty system.\n\nThis has taken me two months to create and yet i'm not a developer  -.i'm a software tester.

Some guys found the paper Google wrote, decided they could build a business on it, and created OpenAI. Their product had an uncanny ability to generate text that passed the Turing test and started selling it. A bunch of other people realized it had a lot more potential and developed the tech as well. Once companies started jumping on the bandwagon, the sales guys stepped in and said, \"hold my beer\" and sold more than they had ever sold before. They got trillions of dollars in investment into various AI businesses and had CEOs around the planet scared to death that their company would miss out if they didn't jump onboard. Every CEO starts prostletizing the new meta and starts delivering their products and... No one really wants them. They're  kinda cool I guess, if you want to have a conversation with something that's not really intelligent. But the real value that they sold from the beginning, the only way most of these projects can even break even, much less turn a profit, is if they somehow increase profits, which they have not done, so far. Best bet so far is people willing to pay $20 a month to use a chatbot like a search engine. The one dim light at the end of the tunnel, and the only thing that will save all these investors' money is if someone comes out with an agent that can replace a human employee. Alas, there's really not much hope for that as we have started hitting walls in performance that throwing more compute cannot solve. People are starting to notice that the latest models are scoring better and better on all the benchmarks, but they really aren't any smarter, they are just getting better at taking the tests. In my honest opinion, Qwen2.5 was smarter than Qwen3. Maybe it's just the quants that my machine can run, but 3 can't answer questions as well. It can't digest internet results and summarize as well. Its logic is weaker. My theory is that Qwen 3 has more guardrails, it's safer. But that makes it dumber. I think that's the roadblock that the companies are coming up against. Since Chat-GPT talked that guy into killing himself, companies are not comfortable releasing a product that doesn't have strict safeties but those same safeties also make LLMs dumber. So companies are throwing everything they have at solving this while training for benchmarks and hoping there's some breakthrough that can get them over the last 30% of improvement they need to unveil the ultimate product. The game changer. \n\n**THE DIGITAL EMPLOYEE**\n\nIf they don't do it soon, all the seed money will run out, the investors will demand their profits, and there won't be any. They are all treading water right now, hoping for a miracle, and the sales guys are out there promising everything and delivering nothing. \n\nI can't wait to see what happens.",

Most of it isn't even going to interest anyone as a product. \n\nBut, there is something satisfying to build something and see it work. Some people who knit jumpers do sell them, on etsy, or market stalls or whatever. i am sure there are one or two people who took up knitting or sewing and made a handmade brand out of it, or maybe scaled it into a larger business. but these people mostly get few to no buyers. Probably the same with this. \n\nI think it depends what people's expectations are. Sure, there are people who believe they are going to change the world with ai from their bedroom. They are more than likely not going to. I am sure there will be that one in however many thousand who do make something useful, popular, genuinely innovative.

Those people don't post online everytime they make something. As they are not deluded enough to think it is importaht to anyone beside themselves, so online, it looks like everyone thinks they are some revolutionary genius. \n\nBut Most people are quietly tinkering away at home and way more than 99% of the ai stuff people make never leaves the machine it was made on or gets shared with anyone other than the person who made it. \n\nOne example i have relating to ai and one person making something genuinely good. I belive openwebui was created and is maintained by one person. They did an ama somewhere on reddit a while ago and i was surprised to find out it is one person making and updating it in their spare time. I guess they are one of those one in however many thousand people.\n\nEdit: openwebui was made by one person and was maintained by that one person for a while. But they are a small team now.

That's why Incubators exist - you need space to try it out because nobody can see the potential until there's an ecosystem to capitalize on it.

You just have to line the walls with hidden metal so that the electricity travels. Then you can get into a car and drive anywhere! ...but you have to get gas every 70 miles. You'll also have to pump it through a huge interconnected system of pipes throughout the country...\"\n\n\nSo instead, people try and solve what they think people want in ways that they think they want it. Ford is most famous for saying \"if I asked people what they wanted, they would have said a faster horse\" when he invented the model T. \n\n\nPeople also can't build things that are cool and don't immediately have a sales pitch. In this near-buesting bubble, to make anything is expensive and you need to have an ROI because nobody wants another OpenAI-sized mouth to feed with endless cash. ",

So what if China can print your house in few days, people still build their own.

They're being pulled from a \"I guess I'll just wait til someone else does it\" mindset into a \"I need this, I can make it myself\" mindset.\n\nMy expectation for almost 2 years now is, we'll get to the point where software doesn't exist... or the platforms of software anyway. I won't need the Adobe Suite because I'll open some version of an AI interface and explain my intentions... create a bespoke application interface for my needs, that matches \"how I handle things.\" I won't be searching the Help > Search to find Layers which has been renamed Pages in this version of the software. It'll automatically be localized, it'll automatically handle any accessibility issues I navigate around.\n\nSo yes, we're all doing the same thing... which is good.

Most LLM benchmarks focus on steady-state throughput or tokens per second once the model is already hot but not on swap, reload, or reactivation latency. In practice, people tend to measure this with a simple harness that repeatedly evicts a model from VRAM and then triggers a cold or semi-cold inference and records time to first token along with GPU memory residency over time. If you want meaningful comparisons, you have to control for disk, PCIe, and host memory effects, since reactivation latency often ends up being more user-visible than raw throughput when you’re switching between models.",

I think somethings to note would be, it doesn't handle minor tilts/skew in the document, and users should be aware of that, but the pipeline provided does have a reliable model to predict the orientation of the document (90/180/270) tilts.\n\nThough it's amazing, I also noticed that there is a failure mode which causes the model to repeat itself (like Whisper), not sure of the cause but something to take note of.\n\nNevertheless it is truly an amazing model and very grateful they open sourced it.",

There's something I didn't mention (but I assume a lot of people already know) , this is an old AMD card and not NVIDIA so that's not always \"plug & play\".  That means that if you don't use llama.cpp, it can be a nightmare for some people to make it work on vllm-gfx906 fork. Every time, there's a new model, I'm not sure if the MI50 setup can make it work with vllm-gfx906, I have to do the \"integration\" myself, looking into the source code, checking the last vllm PRs, etc... that's really time consuming (if you compare with the \"plug and play\" 3090 setup...)\n2. Another thing to know about MI50s, according to the last benchmarks, they have pretty bad speed in Image/Video generation.\n3. I didn't mention neither, but the 26.8 tok/s speeds are for pcie 3.0 with a mix of x4 and x8. For inference, there won't be a big difference in pcie 4.0 x16 vs pcie 3.0 x4. \n4. MI50 does not perform well with \"non standard\" gguf quants, I mean, they have good TG speed for Q8\\_0, Q4\\_0, Q4\\_1, but i remember someone who posted the speed for Q4\\_K\\_XL unsloth quant and it was \\~30% lower than the Q4\\_0\n5. I don't know if Kimi K2 thinking will work with vllm-gfx906, for now, no one tried publicly. You have to know that Kimi K2 Thinking use the MLA (Multi-Head Latent Attention) architecture, the same as Deepseek V3.2 and last time I tried for Deepseek, it wasn't stable after 18k context (generating garbage output). Besides, the kimi quant does 594GB so we need either 32 MI50 (using TP 32 on 2 nodes) or 24 MI50 (using TP8 PP3 on 2 or 3 nodes...). It will use vllm ray backend and last time I tried with deepseek, it wasn't really stable. I might give another shot and post the feedback there if i have time.\n\n\n\nOverall, MI50 setups are still interesting (even at 200-250€ per gpu) if you're ready to spend some time optimizing the software stack to make it work at decent speed.",

I guess, if I really wanted to, I could stuff 24 GPUs (convert two M.2 slots for two more, and bifurcate PCI-E 3.0 x16 to x4 each, with everything else on PCI-E 4.0 x4), but sounds like vllm-gfx906 is not yet ready for production use! My guess, llama.cpp could more more tolerant.\n\nGiven 544G size of K2 Thinking Q4\\_X quant from Ubergarm (this is the biggest possible size since it mirrors the original INT4 weights), and that 256K context cache takes around 80GB VRAM, in total may fit on 20 GPUs but may be tight fit with about 0.5GB headroom per GPU, so now that I think about it, likely would need 22xMI50 for better headroom around 3.5 GB per card. But your current 8-GPU setup is probably more reasonable, 22 GPUs likely to be hard to manage.\n\nIn my case, most straightforward upgrade would be probably just add four more 3090 GPUs, for 8 in total, each on x8 PCI-E 4.0, if I wanted to fully fit MiniMax M2.1 the IQ4 quant in VRAM... I actually planned originally go with 8 GPUs, so I have enough power and space for them, and even four more risers, but right after I built my rig, I had some stability issues, that at first seemed to be caused by GPUs (like \"GPU fell off the bus\" happening from time to time) but as it turned out, were due to bad CPU contact in CPU socket - after resitting CPU couple of times they went away forever, while resitting cards and risers never had any effect on them. However, it took me few month to figure out and I just did not get to upgrade any further yet.\n\nBy the way, I noticed that with lower context MiniMax M2.4 the IQ4 quant runs much faster on my rig with four 3090 (this is closer your testing length):\n\n    prompt eval time =    5587.22 ms /  2277 tokens (    2.45 ms per token,   407.54 tokens per second)\n    eval time =   13539.28 ms /   322 tokens (   42.05 ms per token,    23.78 tokens per second)\n\nPrompt processing seems to be mostly within 400-500 tokens/s range, could not push it any further even after experimenting with various options in ik\\_llama.cpp. But I guess not bad given I have only 24 layers out of 63 in VRAM, and the rest are in slower 8-channel 3200MHz DDR4 RAM.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nThe Qwen team just dropped **Qwen3-TTS**, and it’s a significant step forward for local speech synthesis. If you’ve been looking for a high-quality, open-source alternative to ElevenLabs or OpenAI’s TTS that you can actually run on your own hardware, this is it.\n\nWe’ve put together a repository that provides an **OpenAI-compatible FastAPI server**, meaning you can use it as a drop-in replacement for any app already using OpenAI’s TTS endpoints. Streaming support out of the box, plug and play with Open-Webui.\n\n# Why this is a big deal:\n\n* **Insane Speed:** It features a dual-track hybrid architecture that hits \\~97ms end-to-end latency for streaming. It starts talking almost the instant you send the text.\n* **Natural Voice Control:** You don't just send text; you can give it natural language instructions like *\"Say this in an incredibly angry tone\"* or *\"A shaky, nervous 17-year-old voice\"* and it actually follows through.\n* **Easy Voice Cloning:** Give it a 3-second reference clip, and it can clone the timbre and emotion remarkably well.\n* **OpenAI Drop-in:** Works natively with the OpenAI Python client. Just change your `base_url` to localhost.\n* **Multilingual:** Supports 10+ languages (ZH, EN, JP, KR, DE, FR, RU, PT, ES, IT).\n\n# Getting Started (The Quick Way)\n\nIf you have Docker and a GPU, you can get this running in seconds:\n\nBash\n\n    git clone https://github.com/groxaxo/Qwen3-TTS-Openai-Fastapi\n    docker build -t qwen3-tts-api .\n    docker run --gpus all -p 8880:8880 qwen3-tts-api\n\n# Python Usage (OpenAI Style)\n\nPython\n\n    from openai import OpenAI\n    \n    client = OpenAI(base_url=\"http://localhost:8880/v1\", api_key=\"not-needed\")\n    \n    response = client.audio.speech.create(\n        model=\"qwen3-tts\",\n        voice=\"Vivian\",  # 9 premium voices included\n        input=\"This sounds way too human for a local model.\",\n        speed=1.0\n    )\n    response.stream_to_file(\"output.mp3\")\n\n# Technical Highlights\n\n* **Architecture:** It uses the new **Qwen3-TTS-Tokenizer-12Hz** for acoustic compression. It skips the traditional \"LM + DiT\" bottleneck, which is why the latency is so low.\n* **Model Sizes:** Available in **0.6B** (super fast/light) and **1.7B** (high fidelity) versions.\n* **VRAM Friendly:** Supports FlashAttention 2 to keep memory usage down.\n\n**Links to dive deeper:**\n\n* [🤗 Hugging Face Collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qwen3-tts)\n* [📄 Research Paper on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15621)\n* [💻 Github Repo](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS)\n\nI’m really curious to see how the community integrates this into local LLM agents. The 97ms latency makes real-time voice conversation feel actually... real.\n\nLet me know if you run into any issues setting it up!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sa9itpxw6dfg1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fe58c44a2d0b9d03a5bf099024f18752d48949d",

Kokoro and Piper don't have voice cloning support. Which is kinda nice to have usually for a TTS. Kyutai did also release a pretty small model around 100M params with voice cloning (pocket-tts) as well which is probably gonna be faster than Qwen3 TTS (0.6B and 1.7B params).",

SSE option too for sentence-by-sentence. Vibe coded with Claude Code, certainly not perfect but works for my use case until true streaming gets exposed for us... hopefully.\n\nBut none of this fixes the real problem: the model needs all the text upfront before it starts generating.

The reviewer sees the full context of decisions made. It's not magic - it's just passing data around intelligently - but it feels like they're actually collaborating.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The not-so-cool part\\*\\*: Debugging 7 agents talking to each other is... an experience. Sometimes they work beautifully. Sometimes one agent keeps assigning tasks to itself in an infinite loop. You know, typical multi-agent stuff.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Stack\\*\\*: TypeScript, better-sqlite3, MCP SDK, Zod\n\n\n\nNot enterprise-ready. Not trying to compete with anything. Just an experiment to learn how agent coordination patterns work.\n\n\n\nMIT licensed: [github.com/blackms/aistack](http://github.com/blackms/aistack)\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions or hear how you're approaching multi-agent systems.\n\n",

              "text": "    Great questions - these are exactly the things I've been wrestling with.\n    \n    On memory contamination / identity boundaries: my current approach is pretty simple, honestly. Namespaces + prompt-level isolation. Each agent has a strong system prompt defining its role and capabilities, and they access shared memory via namespace filtering. The key insight is that agents don't actually \"retain\" personality across calls - they're stateless. What persists is the memory content, not the agent's perspective on it.\n    \n    So when the coder stores something like memory_store(\"auth-decision\", \"Using JWT with refresh tokens\", {namespace: \"architecture\"}), the reviewer later queries this and interprets it through its own system prompt lens. There's no embedding space separation - it's the same FTS5 index. The \"identity boundary\" is entirely at the prompt level.\n    \n    Is this ideal? Probably not. But it sidesteps the contamination problem because agents don't actually share state - they share facts. The interpretation happens fresh each time.\n    \n    On memory prioritization: hybrid approach. FTS5 with BM25 ranking for keyword relevance, optional vector search (OpenAI/Ollama embeddings) for semantic similarity, then merge with deduplication where vector results come first (higher quality), then FTS backfill. The \"prioritization\" is really just semantic match > keyword match > recency as tiebreaker.\n    \n    For large contexts I'm honestly just relying on the LLM's attention mechanism. I send relevant search results, not the entire memory. If context gets too big, that's a sign the search query wasn't specific enough.\n    \n    What I'd do differently if this were production: per-agent memory scopes (private + shared pools), decay functions for old memories, explicit \"handoff\" objects when one agent passes to another. But for an experiment, the current approach works well enough to see the patterns emerge. The agents do coordinate surprisingly well when you give them structured ways to leave breadcrumbs for each other.\n    \n    What approaches are you exploring for the contamination problem?",

A basic anti-loop system catches the obvious stuff — \"agent A spawned task B which spawned task C which looks suspiciously like A again.\" But the more interesting patterns are subtler:\n\n1. **Semantic drift detection** — task descriptions mutate slightly each iteration until they're technically different but functionally identical. You'd want embedding similarity checks against the task's ancestors, not just string matching.\n\n2. **Resource exhaustion triggers** — if an agent has touched >N files or made >M API calls without producing a deliverable, something's probably wrong. Hard to tune but catches the \"productively going nowhere\" loops.\n\n3. **Consensus checkpoints** — for high-stakes tasks, require a different agent to sign off before the originating agent's subtasks can spawn their own children. Adds latency but breaks the self-reinforcing cycles.\n\nThe lineage tracking is the foundation though. Without knowing *where* a task came from, you can't catch any of these patterns.

MiniMax was faster and slightly better. DeepSeek was nice when it came to debugging big issues, it's about the same in terms of general intelligence, it's much slower than MiniMax though.\n\nTL;DR\n- DS was smart but slow, good for debugging and planning big changes. It's also very cheap. The main downside is that it's slower.\n- MiniMax is good a default.\n- GLM 4.7 is in the same ballpark in terms of performance but MiniMax felt a little better for me personally.\n\nI think it all depends on what you use the models for.

It's handling complex problems that are usually more the domain of 120/200b models, and it's surprising me. Of course, it's not going to be an Opus, but considering its size, its way of thinking, its capabilities, and good use of tools, etc., its improving speed, and a more up-to-date model, I can only congratulate Z for the great work.\n\nIf it continues to improve, especially the stability and performance drop at high CTX, it will be a very good model. I'm going to stick with it because I'm liking it.\n\nI haven't tried this update yet, let's see if it improves my results. I'm currently dropping to 850/75 over 35/40k(128)",

Finding a working vpn is really hard (I busted my ass to load reddit).\n\n  \nMeanwhile, I've been using my local uncensored Gemma3 12B and Qwen3 8B (on 8gb VRAM with llama.cpp). Then we got access to chatgpt which was pretty good since we could ask it to read contents of some pages or get latest news. But still chatgpt is VERY unhelpful in terms of finding solutions to circumvent internet censorship even if I explain the truly fucked up situation it refuses, and deepseek is worse. This is where a large uncensored local LLM could be very helpful.",
