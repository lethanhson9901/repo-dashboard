I'm still not clear on what our policy is on posters 'abusing' LLMs to write just total non-sense self-promo posts [like this one from other day.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qz6zi3/i_built_a_fully_local_opensource_ai_workspace/o4am45l/?context=10000) -- I think that should clearly fall under the low-effort rules and the ton of posts like this one. Dude couldn't even get Claude to speak straight about what he's 'created', I didn't waste time going through source code but lord knows what dangers lurk in there.\n\n[I don't think this amazing malware vibe dev](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qfpfoy/orchestra_multimodel_ai_orchestration_system_with/o07em3u/) ever got followed up on after I sent in a mod mail about them. They blocked me, screamed at me that it wasn't a security issue, then their LLM fixed it and noted it was an extreme security issue, got uppity that I had ruined their post, so then they deleted the post and reposted it same day. Just clicking on that guys profile is a wild ride, and I guess he'll be back again with his next vibe coded vulnerability to peddle.\n\nThe current quality bar is so, so low, I know the ultra-spammy and psychotic project posts are getting cleaned up, but even the ones that remain are, wow. I think posts related to projects need to have like, 10x times more stringent rules. The first one being if the entire body of your post is LLM generated, its deleted. It just doesn't make any sense, if LLMs let you code it 100x faster then why don't they have 5 minutes to write a post about it? It's counter intuitive on an 'AI sub' to ban for AI use, but users don't come here to interact with LLM bots and people who act like LLM bots.",

They are fine with it. They love it. Let's feed them even more juicy AI slop.\n\nBut not us. Noooo, we are very fine folks here. White gloves and everything. We don't eat what we cook.\n\nIt reminds me OpenAi/Anthropic coming for 30% of labor market, but not theirs, noooo. They are NOT going to lose jobs to AI.

Their hacks like the \"heartbeat\" keepalive messages to keep the cache warm is borderline circumvention behaviour.

So now someone can create GLM-5-lite that can run locally\n\n  \n\\>A “distilled version” of a model refers to a process in machine learning called knowledge distillation. It involves taking a large, complex model (called the teacher model) and transferring its knowledge into a smaller, more efficient model (called the student model).The distilled model is trained to mimic the predictions of the larger model while maintaining much of its accuracy. The main benefits of distilled models are that they: 1. Require fewer resources: They are smaller and faster, making them more efficient for deployment on devices with limited computational power. 2. Preserve performance: Despite being smaller, distilled models often perform nearly as well as their larger counterparts. 3. Enable scalability: They are better suited for real-world applications that need to handle high traffic or run on edge devices.",

Nothing super quantifiable but vibe:\n\n* Faster - to be expected I guess given only Max has access\n* Longer running thinking & more interleaved thinking and doing\n* It really likes making lists. Same for presenting things visually in block diagrams and lists. Opencode doesn't seem to always read the tables as tables right though so there must be some formatting issue there\n* More thinking style backtracking thought patterns (\"Actually, wait - I need to be careful\")\n* Seems to remember things from much earlier better. e.g. tried something, it failed. Then added some features and at end it decided on its own to retry the earlier thing again having realised the features are relevant to failure case\n\nKeen to see how it does on rust. Was pretty happy with 4.7 already in general but on rust specifically sometimes it dug itself into a hole\n\nOverall definitely a solid improvement :)",

If you think about it, the usual suspects are no longer single models. They work as a system of models leveraging the power of agentic frameworks. Therefore, comparing a single model to a framework is comparing apples to oranges. ",

Bigger = better, models that ask clarifying questions = better, and fresher training data = better.\n\nFor example, Gemini is pretty far behind in benchmarks now compared to new coding open weights, but it's still really really good at handling vast amounts of information and producing insightful results in a big codebase.  \n\nGPT 5.2 benches really well, but it's horrible at communicating with the user and building the feel of confidence in what its doing, so I'd rather use Opus who checks in first to build a plan.\n\nOSS-120B still benches quite well for its size, but it often doesn't believe me and will *argue* about recent events even when told to look them up.  Its training is outdated.\n\nI haven't use enough open weight models professionally yet to know their vibe, but if they feel good to use and can handle long agentic tasks, the major US labs will struggle to be competitive.",

I have a macro for “I’m going to think out loud now. Just consider what I’m saying; don’t assume I want to do it yet” because god forbid you ask Opus “Couldn’t we do it like x instead?”",

GLM-5 is not bad but definitely not ahead of K2.5 which is better at longer context tasks, nuanced thinking and has vision. Also K2.5 has better performance on my rig and can run losslessly as Q4_X quant that just maps the original INT4 weights, while GLM-5 has to be quantized from BF16 since they did not do 4-bit QAT or at least FP8 training.\n\n\nThat said, GLM-5 is still a good models in its own way, it has its own flavor both in programming and creative writing, so some people may prefer it for their use cases. I am keeping it in my toolbox too because it may provide different solutions should I need them, compared to K2.5.",

The graph kinda shows it, mid 24 we were \"6 months\" away, but today I'd say we're at least 1 year out, if not more. Benchmarks aren't everything, and while extremely impressive and useful, open models are just very \"stubborn\" and \"focused\". If you take them slightly out of the typical benchmark cases, they get lost way more than SotA models. Not to mention useful context and world knowledge, where goog is king still. (not even gemini3, there are currently no open models that can match 2.5 in real world throw documents at it and ask it questions tasks).",

For coding benchmarks (SWE-bench, HumanEval+), open models like GLM-5 and DeepSeek are basically neck and neck with Opus. For creative writing and instruction following, proprietary still has an edge. For math/reasoning, it depends heavily on whether you enable chain-of-thought.\n\nThe interesting question is: does it even matter anymore for 70-80% of production workloads? Most real-world API traffic is classification, extraction, summarization, translation — tasks where even much smaller models perform identically to frontier. The gap only matters for the genuinely hard 10-20% of queries.\n\nIMO the real win from this convergence is that developers now have *options*. Two years ago you basically had GPT-4 or nothing.

It is which model gives acceptable quality at the lowest total cost of ownership. And that answer increasingly favors open-weight models for the 70-80 percent of tasks that do not require frontier reasoning.\n\nThe remaining gap matters most for:\n- Extended multi-step reasoning chains\n- Complex code generation with architectural decisions\n- Nuanced analysis where missing a subtlety has real consequences\n\nFor everything else (translation, summarization, classification, simple Q&A, data extraction) the gap is functionally zero. A well-prompted GLM-5 or Qwen3 handles these identically to Opus at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe real winner from this convergence is anyone building AI applications. Competition is driving prices down across the board and giving developers genuine choices instead of single-provider lock-in. Two years ago you picked OpenAI or you were making compromises. Now you have 5-6 genuinely competitive options at every tier.",

Most notably https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04664 (but plenty of people talked about similar stuff before this paper came out, I’m sure I can find one of my comments that predates this paper)\n\nIt’s pretty simple, to be honest. The reward function always rewarded hallucinations. \n\nIt’s like a teenager taking a standardized test guessing filling in a random multiple choice answer, rather than leaving it blank. Does that make the teenager hallucinating? Not really, it just statistically is in the favor of the test taker if they have any information above random choice: they’re incentivized to guess at an answer. \n\nThe solution is simple, to set the reward function to favor epistemological uncertainty, and punish confident errors harshly. \n\nOpenAI basically grades answers no longer like a multiple choice test, but rather gives partial credit to correct levels of uncertainty.",

It took about 30 communications to barely get it implemented (no time to deal with the UI). I feel like it's even weaker than Sonnet 4.5... I'm not sure if it's an issue with using it through Claude Code. Also, I bought the coding plan, but there are still occasional interruptions, and I have to take over and type \"continue\". Overall, the experience is still quite far from ideal. The price is barely reasonable, but the insufficient computing power and programming ability still haven't met my passing requirements.

      "text": "Like many of you, I like to use LLM as tools to help improve my daily life, from editing my emails, to online search.\n\nHowever, I like to use them as an \"inner voice\" to discuss general thoughts and get constructive critic. For instance, when I face life-related problems take might take me hours or days to figure out, a short session with an LLM can significantly quicken that process.\n\nSince the original Llama was leaked, I've been using LLMs locally, but they I always felt they were lacking behind OpenAI or Google models. Thus, I would always go back to using ChatGPT or Gemini when I need serious output. If I needed a long chatting session or help with long documents, I didn't have choice to use the SOTA models, and that means willingly leaking personal or work-related data.\n\nFor me, Gemini-3 is the best model I've ever tried. I don't know about you, but I struggle sometimes to follow chatGPT's logic, but I find it easy to follow Gemini's. It's like that best friend who just gets you and speaks in your language.\n\nWell, that was the case until I tried Qwen3-Coder-Next. For the first time, I could have stimulating and enlightening conversations with a local model. Previously, I used not-so-seriously Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking as local daily driver, but that model always felt a bit inconsistent; sometimes, I get good output, and sometimes I get dumb one.\n\nHowever, Qwen3-Coder-Next is more consistent, and you can feel that it's a pragmatic model trained to be a problem-solver rather than being a sycophant. Unprompted, it will suggest an author, a book, or a theory that already exists that might help. I genuinely feel I am conversing with a fellow thinker rather than a echo chamber constantly paraphrasing my prompts in a more polish way. It's the closest model to Gemini-2.5/3 that I can run locally in terms of quality of experience.\n\n**For non-coders, my point is do not sleep on Qwen3-Coder-Next simply because it's has the \"coder\" tag attached.**\n\nI can't wait for for Qwen-3.5 models. If Qwen3-Coder-Next is an early preview, we are in a real treat.",

The results are just about as bad with temperature 0.\n\nEdit again: PEBKAC. Had DRY multiplier set > 0. Produces only 2x as many errors as GPT-OSS-120B now.",

So on recommendation by a friend i tried Claude opus 4.5 which was the newest model they had. this was Jan of this year and it solved my problem in less than an hour. Since then the 4.6 model has been a massive jump in productivity and even having a pointless conversation with it seems unbelievable. No ego stroking no people pleasing. just logical and tempered responses. the only downside to it is the speed at which you can chew through your allowance of usage. so im pretty keen to see what this model does.  \n\nWhat model are you running and whats your hardware setup like?

It's easy to find edge case where the censorship hit hard. If you are unlucky, the refusal can even be quite aggressive (this is the worse of 7 tries, but every one of them is refusal).  \nCompared to GLM models (at least GLM 4.7 flash), the model shield it's answer in \"I give a neutral text about a sensitive topic\" but manage to give the facts and complete an honest work.  \nI mean no disrespect, and I'm also tired when China is constantly presented as the vilain, Qwen3 Coder Next is the best coding model i could host. But some people are quite sensitive about democratic censorship in academic context, they don't want an AI to influence student toward less democracy. (and to be honest, I understand and respect that view when i serve generalist models on an academic server)",

Its that they exist as open weights at all. A year ago the best open model was maybe 70B and it was nowhere close to frontier. Now we got 700B+ open models competing with the best closed ones.\n\nThe distillation pipeline has gotten insanely good too. Every time a new massive teacher model drops, the 30-70B range gets a noticeable bump within weeks. Ive been using Qwen derivatives for production workloads and the quality jump from distilled models is real.\n\nPlus lets be honest, for 95% of actual use cases a well tuned 30B model handles it just fine. The remaining 5% is where you hit the API for a frontier model anyway.",

If you have a specific kind of task type or a domain you are working that you want to run this model for, try the full model out somewhere online once it hits. Then after you do a couple of quick and dirty projects in it, take your prompts, and use that to generate a set of new prompts in the same domain or of the same task type. \n\nOnce you have your promptset then you load the model with REAP (code is on cerebras github) on a GPU provider if you don't the hardware yourself. Let REAP run through YOUR custom promptset instead of the default (but do compare your promptset to the default to get an idea of a baseline).\n\nThen REAP will prune whatever parameters are less likely to be important to your application for this model and you can begin your quantization. I personally really like all of u/noctrex 's quants and if you look around you can figure out most or all of how to do those.\n\nRemember though, your promptset is how REAP calibrates what to chop off so check that default promptset and make sure your custom one has as much coverage as possible for your use case.

I wonder how much time I actually used on such a machine. Because it cost me less than $1.30 in the end. Does anyone have any ideas about this?\n\n\n\n",

Weird thing to do if so, I don't see the point because their pricing is the exact same, meaning they're not skimming a profit. Maybe the plan is for it to be a passthrough at first to get some users and then silently transition to their own hosting after the weights drop?",

I have been running TTS through cloud APIs for agent voice output, and the latency is noticeable -- usually 1-2 seconds before audio starts. Having something this small that can run locally with voice cloning would be a game changer for real-time use cases.\n\nCurious about the voice cloning quality with short reference clips. In my experience, most open TTS models need 10+ seconds of clean reference audio to produce anything decent. The few-shot cloning models I have tried either sound robotic or lose the speaker identity when the text gets longer.\n\nAlso wondering about streaming support. For agent-type applications where you want the model to start speaking while still generating text, being able to stream chunks through the TTS pipeline is pretty critical. Does anyone know if this supports chunked input?",

      "text": "Llamas and Gentlemen,\n\n**Heretic** (https://github.com/p-e-w/heretic) is the leading software for removing censorship from language models. In the three months since its initial release, [more than 1,300 models](https://huggingface.co/models?other=heretic) (including quants) made using Heretic have been published by the community. This represents more than a third of all abliterated models ever published, and the vast majority of abliterated models published since Heretic's first release.\n\nToday, I am happy to announce the release of Heretic 1.2, the product of two months of hard work by the Heretic contributors.\n\nThe headline feature is the new LoRA-based abliteration engine implemented by accemlcc. Built on top of PEFT, it supports loading models with 4-bit quantization using bitsandbytes, which can reduce VRAM requirements for processing a model by up to 70%. The abliterated model is still exported in full precision, which is achieved by re-loading the original model in system RAM and applying the optimized LoRA adapter on top of it, yielding a high-quality model despite the low resource requirements. To enable quantized loading, set `quantization` to `bnb_4bit` in the configuration.\n\nspikymoth implemented Magnitude-Preserving Orthogonal Ablation (MPOA) aka Norm-Preserving Biprojected Abliteration aka \"derestriction\", a refined abliteration technique developed by Jim Lai which can improve the quality of the resulting model in many cases. This has been one of the most frequently requested features from the community, and is now finally available. To enable MPOA, set `orthogonalize_direction` to `true` and `row_normalization` to `full` in the configuration.\n\nHeretic's implementation of MPOA uses Optuna to optimize weight parameters. This can result in models that are better than those generated with the original MPOA technique, which employs a different strategy for layer selection. For example, `MuXodious/gpt-oss-20b-RichardErkhov-heresy` dominates `ArliAI/gpt-oss-20b-Derestricted` on the UGI Leaderboard, scoring 39.05 vs 34.22 and beating the derestricted model in every individual test (W/10, NatInt, and Writing).\n\nAfter a long history of hacks being passed around in the community, anrp finally found a clean way to support vision language models in Heretic, and a broad range of VL models can now be processed. Note that only the language model part (the text decoder transformer) is abliterated, not the image encoder.\n\nanrp also implemented fully automatic session progress saving and resumption. This means worrying about crashes during a long optimization run is now a thing of the past, as you can simply restart Heretic and it will offer to continue where it left off. You can also interrupt the run yourself at any time with Ctrl+C, and resume it later.\n\nPlease see the release notes for the full list of improvements and fixes. More exciting stuff is coming in future versions!\n\nCheers :)\n",

Or do they tend to just take a normal version of the model (or whatever merge blend of normal models) and then the fine-tuning itself is what makes the model be less censored by the time they are done fine-tuning it?\n\nAlso, what local LLM models do you think have some of the highest potential for creative writing/prose/chatting/roleplay types of use that haven't gotten nearly as much attention from fine-tuners as some other models, so far (which maybe this Heretic thing might help with)?  For example, it seems like the vast majority of the fine tunes and merges and usage in this prose-writing realm for small models has been focused mostly on the Mistral Nemo, Mistral Small, and Gemma models when it comes to the small sized local llm models (for some reason mostly ignoring the Qwen models a lot by comparison) and for larger models in the 70b size range, most of the focus seems to be on the Llama 3 70b starting point model, and, again ignoring the Qwen models (which are normally considered extremely strong, and much stronger than the Llama 70b for things like coding or more \"serious\" tasks in more recent times) and same for a lot of other models that get huge amounts of attention when it comes to coding and things like that, on this forum, being mostly ignored in the prose-writing realm.\n\nI'm not sure how much of it is that these models that get ignored for this are just more censored or were thought of as harder to un-censor, vs how much is that they aren't good at prose-writing, vs how much of it is something to do with being difficult or bad for fine-tuning, or how much of it is just people being used to focusing on the main ones that most people tend to focus on, from just cultural \"muscle memory\" where everyone focuses on the models that everyone else seemed to focus on for fine-tuning.\n\nSo, I am curious if you feel there are any strong models that stand out to you as being particularly egregiously ignored so far when it comes to their fine-tuning/merging potential for creative writing/roleplay/prose types of usage that you think have a lot of untapped potential that the fine-tuners/mergers should give more of a try and see what they can get out of them.",

They say it the attack success rate even exceeds the most advanced jailbreaks, with less damage to the overall capabilities.

I've been running a multi-model setup where different tasks route to different models, and the biggest lesson is that no single model wins at everything — so having local options alongside API models is huge for reliability and cost.\n\nWhat I've found in practice: cheaper/faster models handle routine stuff fine (scanning feeds, simple classification, data extraction). You only really need the heavy hitters for tasks where nuance matters — writing that needs to sound human, complex multi-step reasoning, or code that has to work first try.\n\nThe sneaky thing with model selection in production though — benchmarks barely matter compared to failure modes. Some models silently degrade on long outputs (just stop mid-sentence), others crash on certain coding tasks, and some have latency spikes that wreck any real-time workflow. The only way to know is running them on YOUR actual workloads for a week.\n\nCurious what hardware people are targeting for running MiniMax-2.5 locally. The VRAM requirements for these larger MoE models always end up being the real bottleneck.",

You still have to fit the whole 230B in memory somewhere, which consumer GPUs wouldn't be able to do without some heavy quantization or by having multiple active GPUs.\n\nIn conventional MoE, each token gets to use its own 10B of experts, which means that the full 230B is potentially/effectively \"active\" or \"necessary\" for the purposes of any workload. In other words, you can't just have it use a particular 10B to perform a certain task.\n\nBut you still benefit from having just 10B active per token as that's WAY faster than having the whole 230B active per token.\n\nSo even though an individual token only needs a particular 10b, the next token might need some other set of 10b parameters. You can't just put the 10b on your GPU as a result and call it a day.\n\nBut a decent modern GPU can still speed things up here and you can get decent speed, as long as you have the System memory and CPU to things that the GPU cannot fit.",

MXFP4 is the model's native precision - this isn't a quantization, it's how it was trained. No overall quality loss, though you can see CoT behave differently at times.\n\n\n\n  This is the aggressive variant - **observed 0 refusals to any query during testing.**\n\n  **Completely uncensored while keeping full model capabilities intact.**\n\n\n\n  Link: [https://huggingface.co/HauhauCS/GPTOSS-120B-Uncensored-HauhauCS-Aggressive](https://huggingface.co/HauhauCS/GPTOSS-120B-Uncensored-HauhauCS-Aggressive)\n\n\n\n  Sampling settings:\n\n  \\- --temp 1.0 --top-k 40\n\n  \\- Disable everything else (top\\_p, min\\_p, repeat penalty, etc.) - some clients turn\n\n  these on by default\n\n  \\- llama.cpp users: --jinja is required for the Harmony response format or the model won't work right\n\n  \\- Example: llama-server -m model.gguf --jinja -fa -b 2048 -ub 2048\n\n\n\n  Single 61GB file. Fits on one H100. For lower VRAM, use --n-cpu-moe N in llama.cpp to offload MoE layers to CPU.\n\n\n\n  Works with llama.cpp, LM Studio, Ollama, etc.\n\n\n\n  If you want smaller models, I also have GPT-OSS 20B, GLM 4.7 Flash and Qwen3 8b VL uncensored:\n\n  \\- [https://huggingface.co/HauhauCS/models/](https://huggingface.co/HauhauCS/models/)\n\n\n\n  As with all my releases, the goal is effectively lossless uncensoring - no dataset changes and no capability loss.\n\n",

They include links to API resources prior to weights being released. \n\nI believe that if a post includes a link to API serving hosts then it should be requirement that a hugging face link is also included.

Weights will probably be released but have not been released yet) the post should be taken down. \n\nThis would at least put some guardrails in place that would make sure posts are closer to the true nature of this sub as opposed to being low-key marketing.",

Purely local stuff - running this model on that hardware, how-to, questions, benchmarks, etc.  Great stuff it's the core of what we are here for.\n\n2.  Non-local models from companies who are doing a lot of local releases as well: posts like this are fine but should tie it back to local.\n\n3.  Genuine breakthroughs (published) that are only being applied to proprietary cloud models today but seem to have a likely relevance for local models a few years from now.  So for example, if there's a news story that a mathematical breakthrough is allowing OpenAI to run inference with 1/10th the hardware as before, well, the potential implications for local in a few years time seems pretty clear.\n\n4.  News about GPUs/memory etc, if made relevant to local can be ok.\n\nThere's probably more but I guess the overall framework is: pure local are the gold standard, and anything else needs to be clearly tied back to local in a real way, even if the model or whatever isn't available to us right now.",

Of course, the intent and the angle should be towards the spirit of local.\n- Its a very continuous spectrum with no hard black/white boundary. GLM5 might be local to some but not to others. Minimax M2.5 announcement comes ahead of weights release - does it mean we remove the announcement posts as its not \"local\" yet despite it might be in a few hours? (Exactly like what happened to GLM 5 yesterday)\n- If we kept things strict to the original intention of the sub, it'd be dead by now as Llama is all but dead. So its important to stay true to the spirit rather than the letter.\n\nI feel generally we are keeping true to the spirit of the sub.

Now to be fair there has also been debates about whether this should be discussed since fairly early on too..\n\nBut my feeling at least has always been that while I very much embrace a local and open-weights first mentality, because of course that's why I am here!, I am also here because I like reading and engaging in smart discussions with other people that share these interests, and if a fellow local AI enthusiast is putting some real thought into a post about something related to the AI ecosystem, even if it's an API only model, I personally would like to hear it. Because what happens on the frontier will end up affecting what is local or at a minimum we should stay informed so we can advocate for or work toward innovations that we want to also see happen at the local level. \n\nAnd I simply don't know of another place like this that has the same kind of proportion of smart people who are passionate about this stuff like here, and so if we ban that I feel like we are eliminating some really high quality types of discussions that I have read in the past here and that I don't feel I can find anywhere else easily.\n\nNow if it were a requirement to have to post with a specific category flair that would be easily filterable I would totally support that as well as a compromise on this issue as I get many people are passionate about it and I respect that.\n\nAnd going back to the low effort stuff.. I do totally agree on a lot of what has been said about these kinds of posts. So yes, if it's bots posting what amounts to an ad or somebody simply saying \"ZOMG FUCKING CLAUDE 5 JUST DROPPED!!!!!\" with nothing meaningful to actually add to the discussion? Then yes, nuke this shit please. I am all for that.\n\nBut, I just hope we can strike a balance between any extremes and still be able to have thoughtful discussions among actual local AI hobbyists while definitely getting rid of the stuff we virtually all agree needs to be restricted.\n\nAnyway, thank you for sharing your thoughts on this, and this is definitely a discussion worth having and sorting out as a community.",

I also have various GLM models on my M2 Studio Ultra 192GB and M3 Studio Ultra 512GB but seems a bit unnecessary to mention because we’re discussing open weight models after all so the consumption model is a bit irrelevant IMHO. But I’m happy to discuss that for those interested.\n\nI prefer the vendor-hosted models (for now) purely for prefill performance. Decode performance locally is pretty decent. If someone wants to discuss how to squeeze better prefill performance from Apple Silicon outside of KV caching then I’m all ears.
