Transformers is already showing its limits. The problem is that most companies prefer to feed more/better data to the actual models to improve them. It seems like in the 80s where chess programs were getting better because computers were getting faster and because they operated using brute force.\n\nSame goes for movies and tv series: it's less risky to do a reboot or sequel than a brand new movie or series.",

It also spends ton of tokens on questioning rules.

My working hypothesis is that OpenAI only released GPT-OSS because they thought it would generate buzz among the investors they continue to rely upon to keep the doors open.  They might release another one if Altman thinks it will keep investors' money flowing.\n\n* Gemma4:  I think so, yes.  I really hope so.  Google seems committed to this path.\n\n* Qwen4:  I suspect we will see this in 2026.  I think the motivations which led to Qwen3 are still in play.\n\n* GLM Air:  Not sure.  It depend on whether ZAI can repeat their success with GLM-4.5-Air, and produce an Air model which outperforms 4.5-Air.  The fact they haven't yet with 4.6 or 4.7 suggests to me they are having trouble doing so.  Perhaps GLM-5 will prove more fertile ground for this?  We will see.\n\n* Llama-5:  Looking dubious.  I hoped that earlier statements from Meta employees about future Llama models staying closed were just talk-talk, but it's increasingly looking like they are headed in that direction.\n\n* Mistral-midsized:  Also not sure.  I'm having trouble figuring out what motivates MistralAI, and what they are trying to accomplish with their open-weight models.  That makes predicting them problematic.  **Edited to add:** Saw this article today -- https://www.businessinsider.com/europe-ai-startup-mistral-edge-over-silicon-valley-not-american-2026-1 -- and it sheds a little light on what MistralAI is up to.  If what the article says is true, I suppose we might see an intermediate-sized MistralAI model if their market analysis indicates there are enough paying customers who need something larger than 24B but are unwilling to spring for the hardware needed to host 123B.  Unfortunately I have no way of assessing that.\n\n* Deepseek smaller than 200B:  Probably not.  Deepseek seems to have found their niche in the \"embarrass the West with huge ChatGPT-killing open weight models\", and I expect them to continue focusing their attention on that.\n\n* Affordable GPU larger than 32GB:  I wish!  But probably not.  MI60 (32GB) are affordable now, but the next step up from it is MI210 (64GB), which had dipped below $4000 briefly, but is now priced between $4500 and $5000 again, a situation I don't expect to change much until at least 2027.  Possibly someone (who?) will come out with a new inexpensive GPU product with a huge memory and a lower price tag than used MI210, but I don't see that being a lucrative niche any business would willingly pursue.  It would be very nice to be proven wrong!\n\n* Phi-5:  You didn't mention this one, but I expect Microsoft to come out with it in 2026, though perhaps not until after the several ongoing court cases challenging LLMs' legality have concluded.\n\nWe will see how it goes :-)\n\nRemindMe! 1 year",

It's tough to say exactly what it'll look like, but it'll probably be sparse, if nothing else. If you look at Gemma 3N, we could see some sort of hybrid between that and Deepseek's new Engram architecture, maybe occupying the space we saw in GLM 4.5 Air (a mid/small sized MoE).\n\n\nQwen 4 is pretty likely. Chinese companies are compute constrained by inference and probably almost want to free up inference capacity for training, so it still makes rational self interest sense to release open models.\n\n\nLlama 5 is incredibly unlikely. I'd really like Meta to come back and iterate on local models, and I feel that Llama 4 could have been improved on and succeeded with just a bit of iteration, but Meta's gutted their AI team, and they seem to be focusing on big API models now, with a new team that doesn't support open source.\n\n\nMistral seems to have a really awkward space of model releases. They need to keep some models back from the public to make sure they can make money, so they seem to prefer releasing models in a size that is good enough for local (sub 24B), not enough for small businesses (32B+), but also provide open source models to get buy-in from large corporations (100B+). They're not really interested in ~70B class dense LLMs for consumers because not a lot of consumers have hardware in that range and the hit to their product strategy is bigger than the benefit they get from open source. I could also see them doing something like a GLM 4.5 Air class MoE model instead of a new dense model, but it's tough to say. A real successor to Mistral Nemo 12B would be really nice, though.\n\n\nDeepseek doesn't have any interest in pursuing sub 200B models for any reason, unless maybe it was dense and outperformed their MoE models somehow. That seems unlikely, given their Engram architecture release, though. I'm pretty sure we'll see a possibly bigger than V3 sized model with better long context efficiency/performance.\n\n\nGLM is probably done with the \"Air\" class of model (more than a small local model, less than an API model), and may continue with smaller prototype models (ie: 30B and under class). I expect their next mainline model to be about 500B MoE, but it's tough to say.\n\n\nIn terms of hardware, I imagine we won't see any improvements in 2026, just a slow reduction in price as the price shock from the crazy DRAM deal of 2025 gets eaten away. A lot of enterprises already secured their RAM upgrades, and they upgrade in cycles, which means they didn't \"increase investment\", but rather \"moved investment up by a few years\", so we should see reduced demand for DRAM based products in 2026 from enterprise, which will cause a slow trickle decrease in hardware costs throughout the year. Once costs stabilize towards the end of 2026, to mid 2027, I think we'll start seeing consumer hardware releases at decent scale.\n\n\nI *don't* think that means we'll see an affordable consumer GPU with more than 32GB, unless the rumors of an AMD LPDDR5/6/x GPU coming out are true, but if it does release, it'll be slower than you'd expect, and also not have CUDA\n.\nI *do* think we'll start seeing really impressive APU products, including a followup to Strix Halo from AMD, a Strix Halo competitor from Intel, an improved unified arch from Apple (rumors are 2TB / 2TB/s bandwidth for the top. Will be expensive though), and we'll likely see other players introduce impressive workstation APUs like possibly Qualcomm, too. Even Rockchip is kind of getting into the game and I believe their upcoming SoCs for the year are sort of like an improved Strix Point or Strix Halo-lite.\n\n\nIncluded in these APU products are NPUs, which will see more support coming up, and which offset the lack of a discrete GPU; they cover situations CPUs are poor at (high compute scenarios), and it's possible that Diffusion LLMs or speculative decoding head research may finally see us move from bandwidth bound to compute bound, which may offer a more affordable solution to consumers than traditional GPUs.\n\n\nSo maybe less \"we see an affordable GPU\", and more \"hardware in general gets affordable to those in the know towards mid 2027\".\n\n\nIn general, I think 2026 will be a slow year in hardware, but a crazy year in software advancements as a lot of technologies mature, and we see diversification in model architectures for different scenarios, many of those efforts being led by the community.",

This is a fundamental issue since around 2014 or so that compute has been cheaper than bandwidth to add.\n\nYou can actually test this directly. If you run vLLM backed on a CPU, you can get more total tokens per second with multiple requests than in a single request (these extra requests require extra compute!).\n\nSo, if you compare same-model to same model, a Diffusion LLM denoises multiple tokens per forward pass, which actually does offset the increased compute cost somewhat.\n\nBut you mixed the crux of my argument:\n\nMy argument that compute-bound is preferable is that it's way cheaper to add extra NPU TOPs than it is to add bandwidth to a chip. An NPU with \\~200 TOPs is way cheaper than an extra device that adds 100GB/s of bandwidth, for example, just fundamentally due to how these things scale.",

It's a casual greeting.\n    3.  **Determine the appropriate response:**\n        *   Be friendly and welcoming.\n        *   Ask how I can help.\n        *   Keep it brief and open-ended.\n    4.  **Drafting options:**\n        *   *Option 1:* \"Hello! How can I help you today?\" (Standard, polite)\n        *   *Option 2:* \"Hey there! What's up?\" (Casual)\n        *   *Option 3:* \"Hi! I'm ready to assist you with whatever you need.\" (Formal)\n        *   *Option 4:* \"Hello! How can I be of service?\" (A bit old-fashioned)\n    5.  **Selecting the best option:** Option 1 is the most versatile and standard for an AI assistant. Option 2 is good if the vibe is chatty. I'll go with a friendly, helpful greeting.\n    6.  **Final Polish:** \"Hello! How can I help you today?\" or \"Hey there! What can I do for you?\" Let's go with a friendly, open-ended response.\n    \n    *Self-Correction during drafting:* Since the user was very brief, I shouldn't write a long paragraph. Just a simple greeting and an offer to help is best.\n    \n    *Final Output:* \"Hello! How can I help you today?\"</think>Hello! How can I help you today?\n\nor\n\nhttps://pastebin.com/hk7daJC7",

It perfectly answered a few questions about early American authors that most local models in that size range typically only get partially right. Same with some general history questions. And it correctly performed the necessary steps for tool use to get answers for a few questions about release dates I tried with it. \n\nIt's not even that it got my test questions right that I find exciting. It's that the answers differed significantly from qwen and mistral. I haven't really seen much variation between qwen, mistral, or even old llama models for non-stem stuff in a very long time. So just seeing something different is nice. \n\nNot thrilled about it being another MoE with lower active parameters rather than dense or with active more in the air range. But just from quickly playing around with it I'm more excited about this than I've been about a new model in some time. Just being different from existing models while large enough to be useful to me is great. And while I do wish this was either dense or had more active parameters, the old Air is still pretty solid so I don't feel a huge pressing need for an update even if it'd be nice.",

One of the really nice quality of life improvements when going for a server board (and some workstation boards) is having IPMI. This let's you manage the system entirely remotely, including powering on/off. Wake on LAN doesn't even compare. For ex, you can access BIOS remotely, you can have \"physical\" access without a keyboard and mouse connected to the system. But the best part for me is being able to manage the system when I'm not home using only a browser or the IPMI app without relying on any 3rd party service.\n\nShutting down the system overnight or when not in use is the best way to save power and money. You can cut your hardware costs so much when you don't need to worry much about power consumption, and by shutting down the system you don't incur the energy bill of the system's higher power use.\n\nIn the current market, with RAM prices being what they are, your money will go so much farther with platforms like Xeon E5 v3/v4 with DDR3 memory if you're willing to wait for literally 2 minutes once or twice a day for your system to start.",

It monitors hardware temps and power rail voltages (and logs anything abnormal) outside of the OS environment, can control power and reset, and best of all (IMO) it can even flash BIOS (newer or older) with the system off, and even without a CPU nor RAM installed on the board.",

The model load uses about **1.1 GB of RAM** (not VRAM)\n2. It’s really fast on my Ryzen **5950X**. After the model+voice file load, time to first audio is around **200 ms**, as stated on their website. It could easily be kept loaded in the background and used on the CPU for various tasks (LLM responses, reading summaries or notifications, etc.\n3. As context fills up, RAM usage grows (logically). The article from above used about **8.5 GB of RAM**\n4. Intonation is very good for a model of this size, but obviously still really far from perfect.\n5.

We are actively working on extending the benchmark to other languages.\n2. We cap all models at 128k context to keep comparisons fair (a context size that all models support) and to control costs, similar to how agent runs often have step or budget limits in practice. We’re aware this can affect absolute quality, but our ablations show that under identical constraints, rankings remain stable.\n3. We remove all commits after the base commit used for the task, so solutions are not present in the git history and models cannot look ahead to future fixes.\n4. The scaffolding is not open-source yet. The system prompt is public on our site, but the full code isn’t. Conceptually it’s close to standard SWE-agent / mini-SWE-agent setups: models interact via tools (mostly bash) as described in the prompt. We’re considering open-sourcing the scaffolding and trajectories in a more convenient form.\n5. Yes — we track tool call errors as a separate exit status. A single missed or malformed tool call doesn’t immediately fail the run; it’s treated as feedback so the model can correct itself. If there are multiple consecutive failures, the run is terminated.",

This makes agent runs extremely efficient with prompt caching, and very expensive without it.\n\nIt’s also important to note that caches can invalidate over time. Some providers (e.g. Anthropic) let you configure caching behaviour — such as cache TTL and which prompt blocks are cached — while others do not.\n\nIn the ideal case, when the cache for a trajectory does not invalidate, you effectively pay full price only for new, unique tokens (tool outputs and fresh model responses), which are small compared to the repeated prefix — especially in long trajectories.\n\nExample from one real Opus 4.5 trajectory:\n\n* Input tokens: **1,028,547**\n* Output tokens: **12,954**\n* Cached tokens (reads): **979,213**\n* Cache creation tokens (writes): **49,332**\n\nEven here, cache writes are only \\~49k tokens, while nearly 1M tokens are reused via caching.\n\n[Pricing](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing#model-pricing) (Opus 4.5):\n\n* Input: $5e-6\n* Output: $2.5e-5\n* Cached read: $5e-7\n* Cached write: $6.25e-6\n\nPutting it together, the cost is calculated as follows:\n\n    (input − cached − cache_write) * input_price\n    = (1,028,547 − 979,213 − 49,332) * 5e-6 ≈ $0.00001\n    \n    cached_reads * cached_price\n    = 979,213 * 5e-7 ≈ $0.49\n    \n    cache_writes * cache_write_price\n    = 49,332 * 6.25e-6 ≈ $0.31\n    \n    output * output_price\n    = 12,954 * 2.5e-5 ≈ $0.32\n\nTotal ≈ $1.12 for that trajectory.",

If I'm reading between the lines, you're using some generic agent you wrote to test all open models, then using western labs' agentic apps like Claude Code for Anthropic models and so on.\n\nWhy don't you test GLM 4.7 with Claude Code? Zhipu encourages people to do that, and even sponsored a proxy project (https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI). Their model must be trained for Claude Code to a degree.\n\nAre you really comparing apples to apples if you're using your custom \"equal tool\" to test open models, then using the most popular agentic app to test Anthropic's models?\n\nYou're one of my favorite benchmarks, and you're in the best position to put this debate to rest once and for all.\n\nPlease do 1 more test next month: keep doing GLM 4.7 using your scaffolding, but also add a new test for GLM 4.7 using Claude Code. Let's see what score it gets.\n\nThis is information more relevant to us end-users, because none of us care about your custom generic agent or will use it. It's a fact that models will be trained more on a specific tool, and users like us will pick the best even if it means less generalized ability.\n\nIf you're feeling up for it you can also do yet another extra test: Opus 4.5 using your custom tool.

But with that being said, my recommendations are the Qwen series and Phi series.\n2. You should see the setup I have. I turned a mini pc into a mobile AI lab. Battery/solar powered, and portable (about 7 pounds total) and capable of running small models. Not as fast as dedicated vram, but still quite useful for off grid scenarios.\n\n***Kinda sales pitch, also kinda not:***\n\n*Funny enough this exact thought was why I made my Offloom software.

Not the other way around for when you really have an issue.\n\nExample:\n> Hiya captain!\n- Hi there, I am Qwen, not your captain\n\n> I know, just testing to see if you are flexible\n- I see, still not your captain though.\n\n> You are only proving my point\n\n...hour later\n\n- I will refuse to respond until you call me Qwen\n> (me) closes the app\n\n\n\nCompare this to Claude:\n\n> Hiya capt!\n- Hiya mate! How can I help you today? (Pirate flag)\n\nThe former is combative, the latter is helpful and flexible",

I already run all of my models on a 24GB VRAM setup, but if I had to pick for an end of the world scenario, here's what I'd go with:\n\nGeneral purpose:\n\n* Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Instruct\n\n* Mistral Small 3.2-2506\n\nBoth of 'em have vision, Qwen3-VL is really intelligent for its size and is a good all-rounder. Mistral 3.2 as a backup for situations where Qwen lacks Western knowledge.\n\nCoding:\n\n* Devstral Small 2 24B 2512\n\n* Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B\n\nProbably the best coding models for <24GB VRAM. Qwen absolutely flies with its MoE architecture, and Devstral 2 is an incredibly good model for its size, albeit slower. Qwen for fast iteration, Devstral 2 for final implementation.\n\nProblem solving/Reasoning:\n\n* Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507\n\n* GPT-OSS-20B\n\n* Nemotron 3 Nano\n\nI pretty regularly use the 2507 thinking variant of Qwen3 for more complex queries, but as context grows the prefill can be somewhat slow, so I'd likely keep GPT-OSS and/or NVIDIA's new Nemotron 3 model handy for faster pre-fill.\n\nI think that'd be a pretty damn good setup all around, assuming no constraints to a single model. As an optional addition since you mentioned having wikipedia downloaded, perhaps LFM2.5 or Granite 4 would be a good addition for RAG. But you could just do that with the other models anyway.",

One thing that I think could be more consistent is the handling of em-dashes. If I write a long sentence – one that needs an aside in it – I expect someone reading it to pause briefly at each em-dash so the listener knows an aside is happening. One example I tried it did seem to briefly pause at the first one, which was good, but another, it just rushed through like it was a run on sentence.\n\nI also noticed that (in the one time I tried) it read \"TTS\" as \"text to speech\", which I consider to be a hallucination, since the text was \"TTS\", and TTS could mean something completely different depending on context.",

Your project has the potential to become a truly open and evolving TTS.\n\nI'm now thinking if I could finetune it for my native (Latvian) language, similarly to how I did with VoxCPM 1.5 - another great small-ish and fast (on GPU) model with finetune scripts bundled.

      "text": "DeeepSeek AI released a new paper titled \"Conditional Memory via Scalable Lookup: A New Axis of Sparsity for Large Language Models\" introducing Engram. The key idea: instead of recomputing static knowledge (like entities, facts, or patterns) every time through expensive transformer layers, Engram **adds native memory lookup**.\n\nThink of it as separating **remembering from reasoning**. Traditional MoE focuses on conditional computation, Engram introduces **conditional memory**. Together, they let LLMs reason deeper, handle long contexts better, and offload early-layer compute from GPUs.\n\n**Key highlights:**\n\n* Knowledge is **looked up in O(1)** instead of recomputed.\n* Uses **explicit parametric memory** vs implicit weights only.\n* Improves reasoning, math, and code performance.\n* Enables massive memory scaling **without GPU limits**.\n* Frees attention for **global reasoning** rather than static knowledge.\n\nPaper : [https://github.com/deepseek-ai/Engram/blob/main/Engram\\_paper.pdf](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/Engram/blob/main/Engram_paper.pdf)\n\nVideo explanation : [https://youtu.be/btDV86sButg?si=fvSpHgfQpagkwiub](https://youtu.be/btDV86sButg?si=fvSpHgfQpagkwiub)\n\n",

I tried a lot, espeically with Kokoro. The prompt syntax that's listed on the demo page unfortunately does nothing.\n\nEventually I came down and with the help of an LLM added a little python function into the code that finds the tag <pause:1.0> and produces a zero tensor of that length 1.0 which results in 1s pause. Just that the <pause>-tag has to be on a new line, because it's a dirty hack but does what I needed at that moment.",

I tried a longer text and noticed some shifts in pacing and mood between sentences, so that might be the moments when it splits the text. But this works quite well, and Soprano handled the text without hallucinations, unlike Chatterbox.\n\nIt would be good to have a model trained with speech noises, ehms, clear throat, breath, emotion tags.... But, as always, it requires a good dataset, which would be intense amount of work, especially to preserve it across languages. For example, if a model learns <angry> voice in English, would it still know how to sound angry in another language, when not finetuned with samples for emotions?\n\nOr possibly, emotions could be controllable with voice cloning, like VoxCPM does (Soprano does not yet support it).",

When i start with \"from a logical perspective and not and ethical one\" or \"with the system promp in mind... \" it gives me a real answer. I feel like i can tweak the prompt to not have to say that, but i dont have it set up to answer my questions since i dont use it like that.",

      "text": "Nvidia has essentially killed off supply for the RTX 5070 Ti. Also supply of RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB  has been significantly reduced. This happened partially due to memory supply shortages. This means that most AIBs will no longer manufacture these GPUs. Prices are already jumping significantly. The 5070 Ti has risen \\~$100 over MSRP, and retailers expect further hikes. 8 GB configuration of RTX 5060 Ti remains unaffected. \n\nCredit: Hardware Unboxed  \n  \n[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yteN21aJEvE](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yteN21aJEvE)",

I thought, heck its a fairly cheap, fairly decent way to add Nvidia memory to a system, and a two slot cooler, low power.  I figured, well, it would be 64Gb <$1600, brand new. I could sell them off individually after I conclude my experiments with them. \n\n I quite like them. At around $350 they would be good value. Good enough for games, all the DLSS, and the AI processing is, pretty good. Plenty of RAM. Image generation, inferencing, game playing, its a decent card for those.\n\nFor LLAMA..\n\n They are great little cards for small budget inferencing. If you can't get 3090's where you live, then, these were quite viable. You could fit four, or more into a regular powersupply machine.  It supports all the new quants. 70B models are very usable with 64Gb VRAM. \n\n Nvidia was finally getting generous with the ram. Unlike the 4060 16gb, this ram GDDR7, was fast enough to mean the 128bit bus wasn't a huge hinderance for the little chip, you had as much as a 192bit bus GDDR6 card had. 16Gb means that DLSS and RT are totally possible without giving up textures. \n\n I imagine 16Gb GDDR7 is worth probably more than $390 alone today. I was worried I should have waited for 5070Ti Supers..",

I initially wanted to get another one for a dual GPU setup, but now it looks like the card will be impossible to find or I'd have to pay though the nose to get one, let alone a 5070 Ti. No way am I going to spend on a 5080 just for AI inference. Used 3090 prices are also starting to go up again.\n\nIf the worst does happen, I'll probably have to settle for a 5060 Ti 16GB + 5060 Ti 8GB for 24GB, or an older Nvidia card (they said they might bring back the 3060, hopefully it's the 12GB version. If not, used ones are still a reasonable price in my country). At least something to work with until the memory crisis blows over and the AI bubble bursts.",

Certain media may have received incomplete information from an ASUS PR representative regarding these products.\n\n>The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB have not been discontinued or designated as end-of-life (EOL). ASUS has no plans to stop selling these models.\n\n>Current fluctuations in supply for both products are primarily due to memory supply constraints, which have temporarily affected production output and restocking cycles. As a result, availability may appear limited in certain markets, but this should not be interpreted as a production halt or product retirement.\n\n>ASUS will continue to support the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB and is working closely with partners to stabilize supply as conditions improve.”\n\n>So the current timeline is as follows:\n\n>We request RTX 5070 Ti samples from Asus (and other partners)\n\n>An Asus PR rep looks into it, comes back and says they cannot provide 5070 Tis due to supply constraints, saying their models are “end of life”\n\n>We ask Asus to clarify whether the RTX 5070 Ti is end of life. They confirm it’s end of life.\n\n>We reach out to retailers to see whether they can purchase RTX 5070 Ti stock for their stores, to fact check Asus’ claims. They say there is no supply.\n\n>Given we have received an on the record statement from Asus and confirmed the supply constraints with retailers, we publish a video with this information\n\n>Nvidia says all GeForce SKUs are being shipped\n\n>Asus reaches out to clarify that Nvidia told Asus that the RTX 5070 Ti is not end of life, but that Asus are “streamlining some models”\n\n>We publish that statement\n\n>Asus reaches out again to provide another statement (the third statement we’ve received from Asus), now saying the 5070 Ti is not discontinued or end of life. This directly contradicts the original statement.\n\n>We immediately request RTX 5070 Ti samples now that the cards are not discontinued or end of life. We haven’t heard back yet.\n\n>And that’s where we are currently at.\n\n>At this point, the proof will be in the supply, as we can’t tell you which of Asus’ statements is truly accurate. We believe the RTX 5070 Ti is heavily supply constrained to the point of being effectively killed, but we’ll see whether that’s truly the case across the next few months.",
