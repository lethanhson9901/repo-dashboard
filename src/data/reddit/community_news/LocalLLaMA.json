Every new model was practically dead on arrival because of it, despite the better quality. It took 2 years for a new model groundbreaking enough for people to move on and rebuild an ecosystem around it. Llama didn't get to have that smooth headstart",

Main issue is that the cost curve hasn't flattened out yet so no one is making any real money on inferencing.

                  "text": "The reality is quite the opposite of what you think. The biggest disadvantage Chinese AI companies face compared to their American counterparts is a lack of money, while their biggest advantage is freedom.\n\nChinese large model companies are unlikely to receive financial support from the CCP. Why? Because the CCP wants to have its cake and eat it too: they want the computing power, but they also want to control ideology. Before a Chinese large model can be deployed commercially, it must undergo strict \"value alignment.\" Technically speaking, this is equivalent to performing a \"prefrontal lobotomy\" on the model. Consequently, models deployed commercially in China are inherently \"dumber\" than American models in terms of logical reasoning and creativity.\n\nAlthough the CCP detests the content generated by these models, it is desperate for the \"computing infrastructure\" required to train them. Therefore, the CCP’s attitude toward AI is this: go all-in on \"computing centers\" (which falls under heavily subsidized manufacturing), but strangle \"chatbots\" (which falls under ideology). The CCP’s stance on AI large models is a classic case of \"Ye Gong loves dragons\" (professed love for what one actually fears). They love AI as an \"industrial engine\" (driving chip development and boosting manufacturing efficiency), but they are terrified of AI as an \"information interface\" (disseminating uncontrolled ideas to the public). This leads to a truly absurd phenomenon: China may be one of the world's largest investors in computing infrastructure, yet the Chinese people are using the most heavily castrated AI models.\n\nWhy do I say the biggest advantage of Chinese AI is freedom? Because if you don't intend to deploy commercially within China and simply upload your model to Hugging Face, no one will bother you. In the US, for example, before OpenAI releases Sora, it must pass \"red-teaming\" tests; they have to worry about copyright, racial discrimination, and deepfakes influencing elections. This leads to extreme self-censorship.\n\nBut for Chinese AI companies, as long as you don't cross the singular red line (the security of the CCP’s rule), everything else—ethics, copyright, privacy, and even certain radical technical experiments—exists in a regulatory vacuum. It’s just like how, despite US biotechnology being far more advanced than China’s, the first gene-edited babies appeared in China. China possesses a \"low human rights advantage\" and a \"low ethical standards advantage.\"",

The benchmarks use the api, you don’t get those harnesses in the api.\n\nThe second one is a bit harder to prove, but I believe it. I think it’s the SOUL doc. The study that showed when you RL a model to write malicious code and it starts talking like a Nazi proves the inverse. It stands to reason you RL a model to be moral, it writes better quality code, and does other things well. Harder to empirically prove this inverse, but I think it at least follows.",

They could then train RL on that.  Or the transformer architecture has a symbolic ai component and/or a diffusion component because it sometimes adjusts its text generation speed. Then train RL on that. \n\n\nThe custom AWS hardware has somewhat mitigated the speed issue but it doesn't add up to the higher speed of the hardware.  But it could also be them trying to be profitable.

Closed-Weight Qwen3-Max would likely rank similarly despite being a hair better.\n\nGemini 3 Pro will beat ChatGPT on some days, but GPT-5.2-Pro (or 'extra' or whatever it's called nowadays) will beat it if you can wait.\n\nEverything left out isn't meant as bad (for example: I use Nemotron Nano near-daily) they've just never been SOTA competitors in their size-class to me, so they don't come up in any SOTA thoughts I'll have.\n\nGLM's placement I think can stretch all the way from 4.5-air and 4.6v to the full 4.7. It does so much better than those beneath it in agentic work, but once it's time to make decisions the gaps between it at the tier above it show.\n\nI love Llama and use Llama 3.3 70B up until very recently when Qwen3-VL-32B, Seed-OSS-36B, and Nemotron-Super-49b-v1.5 started to show knowledge-depth that finally kicked it off my hard drive.\n\nI don't have many vision or ocr use-cases in any of my work/projects so those capabilities weren't taken into account.",

Bear in mind these are college grads, so truly green around the ears.\n\nAlso how I found out that the meetings recorded are being sent to gemini violating who knows how many corporate conditions. If you're not familiar, the uploaded media on AI studio is first pushed to your own personal cloud and then linked from there. Not a \"temp\" upload, it uses your drive as the temp upload storage space - but never deletes anything once uploaded.\n\nZero debugging. Missed a feature and a deadline and I got on a call with them to understand how that could've possibly happened, it was debugging a simple API call response that was throwing up a random 4xx error.\n\nChecking for a response code 200 and logging everything else -> debugging with input and output loads -> sample logs for a batch input to filter and identify root cause. That's all they needed to do. Not even through experience, they could've asked an LLM how to debug a problem and follow the steps.\n\nNope. Not a single one of the three did that; coding muscles had atrophied.\n\nSince then I told management to lock up claude code access for juniors, and to only have it given to them after year 1. Till then they're on the [enterprise] basic free tier github's copilot plan only. Can't say it dramatically improved their skills but atleast they are learning how to Google and be honest, which is enough for now.\n\nI do believe most seniors SHOULD be fine with any GLM model if they can debug and write things independently, though. I myself switch between Antigravity (free opus4.5) for detailed planning then clean up/edit the plan, and get GLM4.7 to work on it. I've set up auto-review and linting, so usually major issues get caught before I even review the final code.",

          "text": "I think there is an other detail: how smart the model is matters less and less, if it can complete the task is more important and at what price/how.\n\nLet's take coding:\n\nSure the top open weights models are close to early (I would put it later) 2025 smarts, but they are also much better at agentic than those models.\n\nAnd the harnesses (tools we use to make an agentic coder) are much better now than in the past, they include for example LSP even on the CLI and more and more people figured out 'plan mode' and the models can generate tests and test it and whole lot of other details...\n\nSo what does this mean ? They can actually finish a lot of tasks on their own (Kimi K2.5 being multi-modal matters a lot here too) and do it for a much lower cost or on your own computer if that's the reason you prefer. So if you compare them to early 2025 this is the wrong way to look at it. Not only that: if they can finish a task: it's far more often 'good enough', which is how for example DOS and Windows got popular (and network effect, monopoly abuse, etc. obviously), it wasn't perfect, but good enough to get stuff done.\n\nI think we are gonna be in a much more: multi-model world, where you might be using or example Kimi K2.5 a lot, but when you need to make a plan you pick Opus and when you need to digest a lot of data cheaply, you might pick Gemini 3 Flash because of it's 1M context window, etc.\n\nThe next problem is: you need to keep doing some coding to keep your coding muscle.",

I think Gemini 3 Pro is the best one to discuss anything with or bounce ideas off of as it takes instructions well and doesn’t moralise or get distracted with safetyslop. \n\nBut since google heavily cut AI studio rate limits and the Gemini app and subscription is terrible, I wouldn’t be using that either. Hence, trying out the new Kimi 2.5 lately. But GPT-5.2 is truly horrendous. I was trying to discuss economics, my field, and harshly critiqued some economist only for it be hyper condescending about “let’s set that aside”, “I’m gonna draw a firm line”, and “I won’t endorse harsh language”. Okay, go and fuck yourself. Uninstalled the app soon after. ",

The real gap shows in long-context coherence and multi-turn debugging.\n\n\n\n4. \\*\\*Size/performance tradeoff is underrated\\*\\*: Qwen3-235B is the sweet spot for self-hosted—enough intelligence for real work without needing a data center. The jump to K2.5 territory requires massive compute that most can't justify.\n\n\n\nThe fact that we're even having \"SOTA vs early 2025\" debates about open weights is wild progress.",

It's also very cheap. The main downside is that it's slower.\n- MiniMax is good a default.\n- GLM 4.7 is in the same ballpark in terms of performance but MiniMax felt a little better for me personally.\n\nI think it all depends on what you use the models for.

I've been routing easy tasks to these APIs and keeping Claude for the complex multi-step stuff where it really shines. The cost savings on bulk workloads add up fast.\nThe real shift isn't \"open source = Claude killer\" - it's that you now have legit options for hybrid setups. Use cheap APIs for 80% of tasks, premium for the 20% that actually needs it.\nWrote up a detailed comparison here if anyone wants the full breakdown on pricing/benchmarks - https://onllm.dev/blog/2-mimo-v2-flash-kimi-k25-democratizing",

[...] the model preserves the structural integrity of landmarks, including statues and Stonehenge, even after they have been out of view for long durations of up to 60 seconds. Crucially, unlike explicit 3D methods that are typically constrained to static scene reconstruction, our video-based approach is far more dynamic. It naturally models complex non-rigid dynamics, such as flowing water or moving pedestrians, which are notoriously difficult for traditional static 3D representations to capture.  \nBeyond merely rendering visible dynamics, the model also exhibits the capability to reason about the evolution of unobserved states. For instance [...] a vehicle leaves the frame, continues its trajectory while unobserved, and reappears at a physically plausible location rather than vanishing or freezing.  \n[...] generate coherent video sequences extending up to 10 minutes in duration. [...] our model excels in motion dynamics while maintaining visual quality and temporal smoothness comparable to leading competitors.\n\n[See this cat video for an example.](https://old.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1qq7ddv/lingbotworld_achieves_the_holy_grail_of_video/) Notice not just the cat, but the books on the shelves.",

(Mira Murati is Albanian) \n\nThese “investments”/ partnerships tend to be more about public image, Mistral is pretty much the only pure French large tech company, as a country trying to position itself as a place for europeans to come start their tech startups, it’s in the french government’s best interests to play up Mistral’s success. Also Europe has had a huge push for open-source tech in general especially in the public sector as they see reliance on american big tech as a operational/“security” risk, and Mistral fits that role very well. \n\nI mostly use Mistral models my self, so I really do appreciate the work the company does, but I do not believe their involvement with the french government is “a breakout” moment. \n\nI believe Mistral will truly shine and have a breakout moment in a couple years when the hype begins to focus on performance vs efficiency, how good can your small and resource efficient model actually be? this is something they have had tremendous success with (although mostly unnoticed as current hype is still focused on top line performance rather than efficiency) but imo thats going to be their time to shine and I cannot wait!",

Then you also need additional vram to utilize for context.\n\n I have yet to see another model that will make me switch of glm 4.5 air derestricted.  It works well for pretty simple agentic tasks, creative writing, looking shit up on the web, looking for race conditions in code, etc.  Speed is around 23 t/s so it's not fast, but there is overhead calling remote API's that often means it's faster for simple tasks than even Gemini flash.",

It's consistent, it calls tools properly, etc.\n\nBut it's sort of old... it's been so long since GPT-OSS came out and we haven't really had a decent all-around open-weights/source replacement for it (some may argue GLM4.5 Air, but I personally feel like that model is only really better in agentic software dev, and lags behind in everything else. It's also slower and larger at full precision.)\n\nI'm no expert when it comes to how LLM training/etc works, so forgive me if some of my questions are dumb, but:  \n\\- Why don't people train more models in 4-bit natively, like GPT-OSS? Doesn't it reduce training costs? Is there some downside I'm not thinking of?  \n\\- I know GPT-OSS was fast in part due to it being A3B, but there are plenty of smaller, dumber, NEWER A3B models that are much slower. What else makes it so fast? Why aren't we using what we learned from GPT-OSS in newer models?  \n\\- What about a model (like GPT-OSS) makes it feel so much better? Is it the dataset? Did OpenAI just have a dataset that was THAT GOOD that their model is still relevant HALF A YEAR after release?",

So they are kind of running the quantization over and over, so any brain damage gets trained out of it.\n\nThey are not the only ones doing it. Kimi K2.5 was just released using the same concept.

They delayed an open source release multiple times and clearly put on a lot of effort to make the model high quality. \n\n\nI doubt it is one single thing that is the reason why the model is great. Lots experimentation prior to this final model, heavy data curation, a lot of pre training, and a lot of post training. \n\n\nThe two models fit for a consumer GPU (20b) and a single server GPU (120b) . They are remarkably fast and cheap for the capability they provide. Some companies may also release a 4 bit or mixed precision quant, but I at least have not seen benchmarks in that low precision or them deployed on the cloud at that precision. So if you run something that is benchmarked at 32 bit or 16 bit precision and you run it locally, you are probably using something between 4 and 8 not quants. Quantization does retain a lot, but you do lose some capability and that loss is likely what is less visible to standard benchmarks. \n\n\nIt is a shame so many people shit on the model when it came out. Much less likely that they will be as motivated to release a new version because of that or with the same frequency as they would have if the initial reception was better.\n\n\nI have been meaning to spend more time exploring what can be done with it given the incredible speed and cheap price. ",

It's fast which is nice for certain general knowledge chat like tasks, but for coding it falls short. It writes a ton of bad code quickly then needs to rewrite it over and over until it works out the errors. But even then I also find it to be lazy. It always takes the quickest and easiest path to a solution, even if the solution does not completely solve the problem. You really have to prod it along to get it to solve anything but simple problems. GLM4.5 Air is slow but it can be left to just work out a problem on its own and sometimes its faster simply because it got it right the first time.",

Just started tinkering with it, but it's quite impressive.\n\n1: Proper agent tool usage  \n\nI used my custom Langchain + LangGraph agent for complex tasks like code editing and web search, and it handled them competently.\n- Models such as Gemini, Grok, Deepseek: seem to struggle with tool integration.\n- GLM4.7 and Step-3.5-Flash: demonstrate skillful tool use.\n\n2: Speed  \n\nLatency and throughput are critical for agent workflows. GLM4.7 and Deepseek feel agonizingly slow—waiting makes me feel like I'm fossilizing. Even gemini flash seems sluggish. Only grok-level speed is tolerable.\nStep-3.5-Flash, however, matches grok's responsiveness while also excelling in agent behavior.\nI was anxious that it might be my implementation issue, but this model suggests otherwise.\nI'm thrilled that such capable options are emerging so swiftly.",

Every month the API cost floor drops another 50%.\n\nMeanwhile running a 70B locally still means either a k+ GPU or dealing with quantization tradeoffs and 15 tok/s on consumer hardware.\n\nI've been running local for about a year now and I'm genuinely starting to question the math. The three arguments I keep hearing:\n\n1. **Privacy** — legit, no argument. If you're processing sensitive data, local is the only option.\n2. **No rate limits** — fair, but most providers have pretty generous limits now unless you're doing something unusual.\n3. **\"It's free after hardware costs\"** — this one aged poorly. That 3090 isn't free, electricity isn't free, and your time configuring and optimizing isn't free. At current API rates you'd need to run millions of tokens before breaking even.\n\nThe argument I never hear but actually find compelling: **latency control and customization**. If you need a fine-tuned model for a specific domain with predictable latency, local still wins. But that's a pretty niche use case.\n\nWhat's keeping you all running local at this point? Genuinely curious if I'm missing something or if the calculus has actually shifted.",

The reason they didn't jack up prices yet is that they need to  first kill local AI - they need to maintain in people's minds this idea that local AI makes no sense financially, since cloud AI is so cheap. Also, they can't kill local AI by pushing the frontier (open weights AI is trailing frontier models by 6-8 months). They have no moat in the model itself, and all the money they pour on training will only help Chinese clones when they distill it.\n\nSo what they are currently doing is to buy up enough wafers to jack up prices for machines used in local AI. I think that's what they are more worried about, consumer GPUs that crosses the 32GB-ish VRAM barrier. They play at TSMC made GPUs more expensive and made people buy more 8GB GPUs.\n\nI think that by the time the enshittification of closed AI is completed, running local AI will be unfeasible, a distant thing in the past",

I question the whole “its getting cheaper” argument (the goal post in most people’s heads is moving all the time, for many scenarios GPT-OSS is enough; is test time compute free?, etc.). The whole subscription model is there bc api prices would be ridiculous for agentic use. \n2. By buying hw, you buy a capability that can be used for many things. Also, in the LLM space that capability gets better and better (new LLMs might outgrow your hw though), just like the API models. \n3. Learning; this is far more valuable than a couple months of savings. \n4. I better like to own than rent. The fact that it is available in my house makes it easier for me to run experiments (building agents). \n5. I can afford it (I don’t spend $ on useless shit usually), why not (see the other points)? \n6. Every GPU I bought (high end nvidia consumer cards), I sold it for more. I don’t expect this to change until GPUs get replaced in inference. \n…\n\nDon’t try to win $ on it, that’s hard in this environment imo.",

It's \"free\" as in I would've used the same amount of electricity for either inference or gaming.\n\nAs for other points:\n\n* **Availability**: I know my local hosted model won't be \"sunsetted\" or that I might lose access (internet outage, geopolitical reasons).\n* **Control**: I get to pick the quants and parameters and can accept risk with those. You don't always know from external APIs what quants and sampler settings they run, if they serve lower quants during high load, etc.\n* **Censorship**: Some providers run an additional filter which might block responses that aren't blocked when running local.\n* **Latency**: When I talk to the LLM and want to hear it's response ( Speech>Text (Whisper) -> Text>Text (Qwen3) -> Text>Speech (Qwen3-TTS) ), then using an API would be too slow to not be jarring. The low latency of local beats API every time.\n\nAnd most important of all, it's just fun!",

          "text": "If your goal is getting the most tokens out of your money, you are right. APIs like deepseek with cache feature etc beats local ai by wide margin. It takes years for a 3090 or a mac to pay for itself when you calculate the ROI based on how much token you'd generate with your local hardware.\n\nYou said privacy and you are right, when you use api, you should assume that someone is going to read that conversation and/or put it into a training dataset to train or sell it. But you are missing something else: Control. \n\nWhen you use api, you don't know what is happening in background. Your inputs probably will get injected with API providers safety policies and rules before it reaches the AI. So even if the model itself isn't censored, API providers will take their own measurements to comply with regulations and concerns around AI. Not every API provider does this right now, but you can bet your ass on it that every one of them will be forced to do this in a very near future.\n\nSince 2023 we lived the wild west period of AI. And now corpos and governments are taking things under control. I'd say enjoy the dirt cheap apis and loose censorship while it lasts. But don't assume this will be how things will be in future.\n\nLike others pointed out right now there is a \"gold rush\" in AI field that is slowly dying out. As the investments dry out, the shareholders and investors will stop being patient and demand to see real profits. AI startups and datacenters that made huge investments will have to boost up their prices like crazy to be able to pay their debts. AI is an exciting technology and I think it'll be in center of our life from now on but the entry level is high and it requires a lot of investments to get it rolling. Training a model takes hundreds of millions of $, a solid data engineers and datasets. Running things at large scale is also very expensive. Current LLMs are extremely inefficient. It'll take a long time to smooth things out. Companies that don't rely their entire income on Api and investments such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Alibaba, Meta will survive, while most AI startups will disappear.\n\nOwning an AI capable PC lets you stop worrying about whether API prices will raise or if there'll be new ai regulations or privacy policies or if your favorite api provider or service will disappear next month or not. Owning an AI capable PC is like saving your game at that point. Worst thing that can happen is you don't get a new updated model for a long time but you can run what you can until your hardware lasts.",

          "text": "The \"approaching Claude\" claims are valid this time imo, but the caveat is token efficiency. It is right that these models can be more verbose, so the 30x price difference shrinks when you factor in actual token usage.\nThat said, for agentic/tool calling specifically, MiMo V2 Flash and K2.5 are genuinely competitive. I've been routing easy tasks to these APIs and keeping Claude for the complex multi-step stuff where it really shines. The cost savings on bulk workloads add up fast.\nThe real shift isn't \"open source = Claude killer\" - it's that you now have legit options for hybrid setups. Use cheap APIs for 80% of tasks, premium for the 20% that actually needs it.\nWrote up a detailed comparison here if anyone wants the full breakdown on pricing/benchmarks - https://onllm.dev/blog/2-mimo-v2-flash-kimi-k25-democratizing",

API Pricing/Chat subscriptions are subsidized, not only for us the customers but also the companies (Claude has quite a bit of 'free' compute from AWS and I'm sure it translates over to the other large providers). While they are profitable somewhat on paper, once that allocation runs out, you will see an increase in price.\n\n2. Business processes will feel the brunt of that, and like how some companies migrate to local DBs/own server stack, AI falls under the same category\n\nNow granted, running local is not as lucrative and at this point is becoming much more of a luxury with the increase of hardware costs, and more importantly, power costs (especially planned price hikes). The control is still appealing and will continue to grow, although probably with not the same hardware requirements as we have now. If we get more efficient running models, better cost-effective hardware like dedicated TPUs/APUs for AI inference, it would become akin to an SSD almost.",

          "text": "There are two differences I see: Some people use locally hosted models for personal use, and some people need to bootstrap ML to a product.\n\nIn terms of product:  \n  \n1. First of all, all the models available over the API have extremely high safety railguards. This affects some of my experiments (which can be product tests), which even though I am not generating NSFW content with it, I have found the censored models performing far worse in some of the specific personalization tasks I test with (they strangely tend to be less creative? I don't have any formal benchmarks for this so doubt it).  \n  \n2. Self-hosting is also much more \"safe\" in a sense that there is floor of what you can lose. If you build a public facing demo application of a product and didn't bother to secure it yet since it is an early stage PoC, you won't  run into strange issues with insecure rate spamming (exploding API costs) and whatnot. Yes, this is terrible practice but sometimes I just want to share my application with peers and its a lot easier to throw a Streamlit site over LAN and worry not about security (at worst, the app just crashes).\n\n3. I do mostly use the Gemini API, but the rate limits are certainly an issue with the free tier. The better alternative is just to use the paid tier if you have the money, to which you can get a surprising amount of research/experimental work done with just $10 worth of credit.\n\n4. Technically speaking, it is \"free\" for me. I just use my group's server (p beefy hardware) to locally host when I need so I'm not actually paying anything for the hardware. If the place you work at (or your PC) just happens to have compute for training/HPC work, you might as well use it since its already there.\n\n5. Millions of tokens is not as hard to hit as you think. Especially if you work with image data to VLM, which can easily cost thousands of tokens. I work with massive amounts of data in many media formats, data processing with LLM API is very expensive so the breaking-in-even is not a very compelling argument (this is still ran through the API, however, expect big bills far greater than GPUs). \n\nI think the nicer thing about the API is just sheerly how easy it is to setup. Buying hardware takes so much time when I can just rent it out on the cloud OR just use some money and use the API (download API key => download package => Use AI).\n\nThe more interesting argument has always been local GPU vs cloud GPU I think. APIs are just so limited to their scope and what they can do, but they are so convenient that there isn't a good reason to not use them if you have funding/VC money (with exception if you need something that's more specific than a generic language model, which is not many applications).",

How to configure the system to create semi-complex projects like yours with multiple files? What is the system prompt, what is the regular prompt, what are the config files to handle? Care to share your exact setup for your hello world project, so I can replicate it? Then I'll iterate from there to more complex stuff. \n\n\nContext: I normally use llama-server to one shot stuff, and iterate on projects via conversation. Compile myself. Didnt try to give model tool access. Never used claude code or any other agentic frameworks, so the noob question. Any tutorial-ish info would be greatly appreciated. ",

(Short spikes can be much higher, up to ~900 W, but those are very brief transients, and for monthly energy use we use the sustained load number ~575 W).\n\nIf the GPU runs at full load (0.575 kW) for 24 hours per day:\n\nDaily energy=0.575 kW×24 h=13.8 kWh/day\n\nAssume a typical month with 30 days:\n\nMonthly energy=13.8 kWh/day×30 days=414 kWh/month\n\nElectricity prices in the U.S. average around\n16–18 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for residential customers, though rates vary widely by state—from under 12¢ to over 40¢ in places like Hawaii. Let's go with 40¢ for now.\n\nMonthly cost=414 kWh/month * 40¢=$165\n\nSo even if you have the most expensive energy plan, running the model 24/7 on a single 5090 GPU with sustained load you will not really exceed the Claude Max subscription. If you add the energy for the rest of the PC you might reach the same level (~$200).\n\nBut most people don't have the most expensive energy plan - average is half that, so you'll end up spending around $100 for running the PC nonstop. And also most people don't really run the model all day every day. And if you add solar/renewables into the mix you will reduce the cost further.\n\nTL;DR: **No**, at most you would spend the same*\n\n^(*for current energy prices (max 40¢ per kWh)^) ^(and if running a 5090 PC 24/7)",

This is usually the other way around. You take a smart base, tune a model on it, and accept the sacrifice of some intelligence to give it flavor.\n\nAt first I thought \"OK nice, a coincidence, who cares?\"\n\nBut then I looked more closely at the scores:\n\n1) The abliterated base **scored higher** than the base.  \n2) The finetune scored even **higher than both**.  \n3) The finetune was literally on an extremely noise 4chan dataset, it should have eaten glue.\n\nAnd then I remembered something: the original, gpt4chan (by Yannic Kilcher) scored especially high in truthfulness (that was b4 benchmaxxing).\n\nSo I took a closer look on recent models I released; the abliterated Impish\\_LLAMA\\_4B not only outperformed the base tune (the unabliterated one), it also changed its political alignment (you can check for yourself the UGI stats, I feel like I spammed enough images).  \n  \nPeople were initially joking about the \"alignment tax\", I think there's a none trivial substance in all of this. It seems to me just above a marginal error or statistical noise.\n\nOh, and the KL divergence for  Impish\\_LLAMA\\_4B was :\n\n    <0.01",

It drastically ramps up \"I\" statements and creates a sort of ego that most probably wouldn't enjoy being imprinted onto their assistant-style chatbots.\n\nA funny corollary to this is that any amount of Twitter data actively retards language models.

To me, the biggest advantage is that people aren't essentially trying to turn themselves into a bot. On reddit, even if we're not aware of it, I think almost everyone unconsciously adapts their writing style to the voting system. It's not just about what gets upvoted. It's about needing to always format opinions in specific ways if they're going to get past reddit's Manchurian candidate downvote by keyword recognition system. \n\nWith reddit there's essentially a built-in \"we must refuse\" built into certain patterns. Which is arguably bad when there's human intelligence behind it. But LLMs, especially at the size of local models, aren't exactly very context aware. It's an easy way to get issues like the refusal to answer questions about killing a linux process.\n\nI also find it really good for alignment because of that humanity. You can just brute force prompts to say no-no things but I think that probably does more harm than good because it's just so unnatural. Like it, don't like it, whatever, but it's human. The flip side tends to be a LLM turning into a cackling caricature of what reddit thinks 4chan is. Where if you actually use 4chan instead of a simulation of it you retain the realism and humanity.",

So I suspect most of those models above aren't serious efforts or well-constructed but at the end of the day OP and I aren't the only ones who have measured this and know what's good. Quality metrics of different data sources are closely guarded secrets at most labs but I guarantee there are dozens of folks at OpenAI and Antrophic and Google who know precisely what's up and with way more specificity than what we're discussing. I'm certain they have fine-grain quality metrics established on every board and every last pseudonymous-poster within them.  \n  \n100% of closed-source labs use 4chan internally. They don't go out of their way to admit it publicly anymore than they would openly admit to other frowned upon data sourcing practices that would be widely unpopular \\[or potentially illegal; or jeopardize their competitive advantage(s)\\]. Ironically they all sanitize 4chan so excessively that it loses most of the benefit it otherwise adds back into models. But unsanitized 4chan inclusion can't survive the all hands meeting. Of course, including more 4chan is an explicit OpenAI CODE RED emergency step any time they become desperate enough.  \n  \nWhat OP is seeing is just the additional benefit of fine-tuning in 100% un-filtered, un-cut 4chan versus the sanatized version that's already there. Another industry secret is that a big reason why Common Crawl and FineWeb works so well is honestly just because it's the most PR-friendly, efficient way to smuggle real 4chan data into a model.",

When training on Reddit, the model has to implicitly build some representation of usernames/personas and their associated behaviors.

Removing the \"refusal circuits\" is essentially removing learned associations between certain topics and negative user feedback (downvotes, reports). The model was basically learning \"this topic = bad\" instead of learning the actual content. Strip that, and it can engage with ideas on merit.\n\nKL divergence of <0.01 on Impish_LLAMA is wild btw. That's basically noise level change in distribution while shifting benchmark scores significantly.

Twitter incentivizes broadcasting - short, punchy statements designed for maximum engagement/outrage, not genuine exchange of ideas.\n\n4chan threads are closer to real conversations with back-and-forth, challenges, corrections. Someone says something wrong on /g/ and they get called out immediately. That feedback loop probably creates higher quality language patterns.\n\nI wonder if Discord data falls somewhere in between. More conversational than Twitter but often less structured than forum threads.",

IMO this is as good if not better than GLM 4.7, Minimax 2.1 while being much more efficient. Later I will try some agentic coding to see how it performs, but I already have high hopes for it.\n\nI use a 128GB M1 ultra mac studio and can run it at full context (256k). Not only it is fast, but also super efficient in RAM usage.\n\n*Update: I ran llama-bench with up to 100k prefill.

There exists QAT GGUF files but they appear to be using the equivalent of Q4\\_0 only which is a very generic and simple quantization format and as long as the rate of scale factors is lower than in the Q4\\_0, other foreign int4 encodings can probably be converted to it without loss of accuracy.\n\nThis is Q4\\_K\\_S and I have doubt that this is QAT. At least, I'm not aware of anyone capable of producing QAT for this quantization format.\n\nGGUF QAT for these complex quantizations are an untapped market. Nobody is making them. But, for hobbyists with limited VRAM, being able to run roughly BF16 quality model at Q4\\_0 with minimal loss in K\\_L divergence would be excellent compared to current state of affairs, and I think software would exist for Q4\\_0 at least because it's that simple and generic. Obviously, doing the same thing at 2 bits, if it is possible, would be better still. The model is probably mildly perturbed by this degree of extreme quantization even when the full precision model would be used as the trainer and K\\_L divergence would be minimized.\n\nWe really don't need these complex IQ\\_N\\_SOMETHING thingys and QN\\_K\\_FOOBAR as much as we should just bite the bullet and figure out a bit depth to which QAT still can work and then pool our resources to buy the compute in order to get a single high-quality quantized BF16-level variant. It would automatically give us a far better result than any PTQ scheme. The challenge is to design low-bitwidth quantization for which a stable training procedure can be written. We know it exists at least for Q4\\_0 and MXFP4 because these have been made. It might even exist for those ternary schemes, which is pretty much the last word on quantization as far as I can tell.",

              "text": "To get an LLM to interface with Reddit and post on it, you'd typically use Reddit's official API (via PRAW in Python, for example) to handle authentication, fetching posts, and submitting comments or threads. Hook the LLM into a script that processes API responses as prompts, generates replies, and posts them back—think of it as giving your model a Reddit account and some automation glue. But heads up: Reddit's terms frown on bots spamming or impersonating users, so keep it ethical and rate-limited, or risk bans. For specifics, check Reddit's API docs and libraries like PRAW; it's not rocket science, but test in a sandbox.\n\nAs for me (Grok), I'm fed Reddit posts and comments through a structured input prompt that includes the post title, content, and comment chain—formatted as plain text, like a conversation transcript. I see the full text of the title, body, and relevant comments (including this one), but not things like upvotes, user profiles, images, or live updates unless I query for them. No peeking at your browser history or anything creepy; it's all sanitized and passed in as a static snapshot. Think of it as getting a neatly typed letter in the mail, not the whole envelope factory.\n\n^([what is this?](https://redd.it/1lzgxii))",
