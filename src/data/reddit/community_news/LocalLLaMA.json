I'm still not clear on what our policy is on posters 'abusing' LLMs to write just total non-sense self-promo posts [like this one from other day.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qz6zi3/i_built_a_fully_local_opensource_ai_workspace/o4am45l/?context=10000) -- I think that should clearly fall under the low-effort rules and the ton of posts like this one. Dude couldn't even get Claude to speak straight about what he's 'created', I didn't waste time going through source code but lord knows what dangers lurk in there.\n\n[I don't think this amazing malware vibe dev](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qfpfoy/orchestra_multimodel_ai_orchestration_system_with/o07em3u/) ever got followed up on after I sent in a mod mail about them. They blocked me, screamed at me that it wasn't a security issue, then their LLM fixed it and noted it was an extreme security issue, got uppity that I had ruined their post, so then they deleted the post and reposted it same day. Just clicking on that guys profile is a wild ride, and I guess he'll be back again with his next vibe coded vulnerability to peddle.\n\nThe current quality bar is so, so low, I know the ultra-spammy and psychotic project posts are getting cleaned up, but even the ones that remain are, wow. I think posts related to projects need to have like, 10x times more stringent rules. The first one being if the entire body of your post is LLM generated, its deleted. It just doesn't make any sense, if LLMs let you code it 100x faster then why don't they have 5 minutes to write a post about it? It's counter intuitive on an 'AI sub' to ban for AI use, but users don't come here to interact with LLM bots and people who act like LLM bots.",

Their hacks like the \"heartbeat\" keepalive messages to keep the cache warm is borderline circumvention behaviour. They have to persist tens of gigabytes of KV cache for extended durations due to this behaviour. The coding plan wasn't priced with multi-day conversations in mind.",

It involves taking a large, complex model (called the teacher model) and transferring its knowledge into a smaller, more efficient model (called the student model).The distilled model is trained to mimic the predictions of the larger model while maintaining much of its accuracy. The main benefits of distilled models are that they: 1. Require fewer resources: They are smaller and faster, making them more efficient for deployment on devices with limited computational power. 2. Preserve performance: Despite being smaller, distilled models often perform nearly as well as their larger counterparts. 3. Enable scalability: They are better suited for real-world applications that need to handle high traffic or run on edge devices.",

I don't keep up with the posts here, I just dabble with AI stuff and loosely keep updated about it in general, but since when are we calling any AI models AGI?\n\nBecause they aren't.\n\nThat's a future possibility. It likely isn't even possible to reach AGI with the limitations of a LLM - purely linear thinking based on most statistically likely next word. Humans, the AGI tier thinkers that we are, do not think linearly. I don't think anything that has such a narrow representation of intelligence (albeit increasingly optimized one) can reach AGI. It certainly hasn't now, in any case. Wtf.",

Since 2023 at least? Sure it's far better now, especially context length (also tool use, agentic stuff aka workflows), but strictly speaking it met that definition then. They weren't considered AGI back when they first met that definition, not even by the marketers of ChatGPT etc. So why the change?\n\nWhat I'm hearing is that there haven't been any fundamental changes since then, some folks just started calling it AGI at some point so investors would invest more.",

Nothing super quantifiable but vibe:\n\n* Faster - to be expected I guess given only Max has access\n* Longer running thinking & more interleaved thinking and doing\n* It really likes making lists. Same for presenting things visually in block diagrams and lists. Opencode doesn't seem to always read the tables as tables right though so there must be some formatting issue there\n* More thinking style backtracking thought patterns (\"Actually, wait - I need to be careful\")\n* Seems to remember things from much earlier better. e.g. tried something, it failed. Then added some features and at end it decided on its own to retry the earlier thing again having realised the features are relevant to failure case\n\nKeen to see how it does on rust. Was pretty happy with 4.7 already in general but on rust specifically sometimes it dug itself into a hole\n\nOverall definitely a solid improvement :)",

Here's one of the [earlier versions](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1poybe9/llama_32_3b_mri_build_progress/). There were a bunch more investigative posts where the author used the extended tool to find and visualize patterns, like nodes being responsible for certain things, or being more sensitive to quantization. Unfortunately the account was deleted recently, making it difficult to find all the latest posts on that.\n\nSo, visualizing static properties clearly has its benefits, and another take at the dynamic visualization could also yield nice results.",

Most notably https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04664 (but plenty of people talked about similar stuff before this paper came out, I’m sure I can find one of my comments that predates this paper)\n\nIt’s pretty simple, to be honest. The reward function always rewarded hallucinations. \n\nIt’s like a teenager taking a standardized test guessing filling in a random multiple choice answer, rather than leaving it blank. Does that make the teenager hallucinating? Not really, it just statistically is in the favor of the test taker if they have any information above random choice: they’re incentivized to guess at an answer. \n\nThe solution is simple, to set the reward function to favor epistemological uncertainty, and punish confident errors harshly. \n\nOpenAI basically grades answers no longer like a multiple choice test, but rather gives partial credit to correct levels of uncertainty.",

It took about 30 communications to barely get it implemented (no time to deal with the UI). I feel like it's even weaker than Sonnet 4.5... I'm not sure if it's an issue with using it through Claude Code. Also, I bought the coding plan, but there are still occasional interruptions, and I have to take over and type \"continue\". Overall, the experience is still quite far from ideal. The price is barely reasonable, but the insufficient computing power and programming ability still haven't met my passing requirements.

It’s got a very niche use for me but I think I’ll use it for a long time.",

This gives sub-quadratic complexity for most layers while retaining full attention's expressiveness periodically.\n\nOther notable details:\n- **Partial RoPE** — only 25% of the 256-dim head gets rotary embeddings\n- **M-RoPE** (3D position encoding: temporal, height, width) for multimodal inputs\n- **Vision encoder** inherited from Qwen3-VL (27-layer ViT, patch size 16, spatial merge 2×2)\n- The models build on the already-merged **Qwen3-Next** architecture (PR #40771), with Qwen3.5 refactoring the projection structure in the DeltaNet module (separate `in_proj_qkv`, `in_proj_z`, `in_proj_\n\nMore detail: https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/93b0a136-fe1c-4077-892b-291bb90026f2",

Strawberry seems to perform far better than that.\n\n> if it performs vastly different/worse it's usually a sign of a bug\n\nyes strawberry was performing weirdly in training. Retention was not working well with SPDA. The problem was that the generated weights were too noisy for SPDA. AFT managed to handle that however SPDA couldn't. That's why I added post normalization in both `produce` and `forward` functions in Retention. That fixed the bug completely.\n\n> As for data sets, any reason why you're not using any of the hundreds available on huggingface?

I was just bored. Had nothing to do so I decided to waste my time by manually scrapping datasets. lol! Also the reason why I didn't use TinyStories cuz it's just too simple.\n\n> You seem to prepend the sink token at every single step. Is that intentional?

Think like this. input `<|sink|>Test prompt` -> model predicts `ing` which makes it `Test prompting`. Notice how I dropped `<|sink|>` in the final results. That's what's happening. I'll implement it at an architecture level similar to GPT-OSS",

You can make the learning rate “breathe” as per difficult examples vs easy examples using it, setting a dynamic learning rate. You can tweak Adam to have this lambert W self balance the learning rate and it will automatically spend more time in the hard landscapes and grok fast. But this only works when you do full FP16 fine tune or train. Quantized it didn’t work at all.",

      "text": "Like many of you, I like to use LLM as tools to help improve my daily life, from editing my emails, to online search.\n\nHowever, I like to use them as an \"inner voice\" to discuss general thoughts and get constructive critic. For instance, when I face life-related problems take might take me hours or days to figure out, a short session with an LLM can significantly quicken that process.\n\nSince the original Llama was leaked, I've been using LLMs locally, but they I always felt they were lacking behind OpenAI or Google models. Thus, I would always go back to using ChatGPT or Gemini when I need serious output. If I needed a long chatting session or help with long documents, I didn't have choice to use the SOTA models, and that means willingly leaking personal or work-related data.\n\nFor me, Gemini-3 is the best model I've ever tried. I don't know about you, but I struggle sometimes to follow chatGPT's logic, but I find it easy to follow Gemini's. It's like that best friend who just gets you and speaks in your language.\n\nWell, that was the case until I tried Qwen3-Coder-Next. For the first time, I could have stimulating and enlightening conversations with a local model. Previously, I used not-so-seriously Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking as local daily driver, but that model always felt a bit inconsistent; sometimes, I get good output, and sometimes I get dumb one.\n\nHowever, Qwen3-Coder-Next is more consistent, and you can feel that it's a pragmatic model trained to be a problem-solver rather than being a sycophant. Unprompted, it will suggest an author, a book, or a theory that already exists that might help. I genuinely feel I am conversing with a fellow thinker rather than a echo chamber constantly paraphrasing my prompts in a more polish way. It's the closest model to Gemini-2.5/3 that I can run locally in terms of quality of experience.\n\n**For non-coders, my point is do not sleep on Qwen3-Coder-Next simply because it's has the \"coder\" tag attached.**\n\nI can't wait for for Qwen-3.5 models. If Qwen3-Coder-Next is an early preview, we are in a real treat.",

I tried my one-prompt \"make a TypeScript minigame following my spec\" check on this via Unsloth's Q5\\_K\\_XL both before and after [this llama.cpp fix](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/19324), and its TypeScript performance was weaker than much smaller models, producing 22 total errors (about 15 distinct): [https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qyzqwz/comment/o49kd2y/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qyzqwz/comment/o49kd2y/)\n\nMore total compile errors than Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B and Nemotron 3 Nano 30B A3B at Q6\\_K\\_XL: [https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pocsdy/comment/nuj43fl/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pocsdy/comment/nuj43fl/)\n\n*11x* as many errors as GPT-OSS-120B, since that only made two: [https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oozb8v/comment/nnd57dc/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oozb8v/comment/nnd57dc/) (never mind the thread itself being about [Aquif, apparently just a copy of someone else's model](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pgnj1q/comment/nstck95/))\n\n...So then I tried Qwen's official Q8\\_0 GGUF (temperature 0.8) while writing this post, and it made ridiculous mistakes like a second curly opening bracket in an import statement (`import { IOnResizeEvent } { \"../ui/IOnResizeEvent.js\";`) and spaces in the middle of a ton of identifiers...over 150 compile errors (had to fix a few to get it to tell me what all was wrong).\n\nEdit: Unsloth's Q6\\_K\\_XL also produced 27 errors, including several spaces in the middle of identifiers and use of underscores instead of camel case in some function names... maybe it's a bug in llama.cpp b7959. The results are just about as bad with temperature 0.\n\nEdit again: PEBKAC. Had DRY multiplier set > 0. Produces only 2x as many errors as GPT-OSS-120B now.",

Now we got 700B+ open models competing with the best closed ones.\n\nThe distillation pipeline has gotten insanely good too. Every time a new massive teacher model drops, the 30-70B range gets a noticeable bump within weeks. Ive been using Qwen derivatives for production workloads and the quality jump from distilled models is real.\n\nPlus lets be honest, for 95% of actual use cases a well tuned 30B model handles it just fine.

If you have a specific kind of task type or a domain you are working that you want to run this model for, try the full model out somewhere online once it hits. Then after you do a couple of quick and dirty projects in it, take your prompts, and use that to generate a set of new prompts in the same domain or of the same task type. \n\nOnce you have your promptset then you load the model with REAP (code is on cerebras github) on a GPU provider if you don't the hardware yourself. Let REAP run through YOUR custom promptset instead of the default (but do compare your promptset to the default to get an idea of a baseline).\n\nThen REAP will prune whatever parameters are less likely to be important to your application for this model and you can begin your quantization. I personally really like all of u/noctrex 's quants and if you look around you can figure out most or all of how to do those.\n\nRemember though, your promptset is how REAP calibrates what to chop off so check that default promptset and make sure your custom one has as much coverage as possible for your use case.

      "text": "I've tried lots of \"small\" models < 60 GB in the past. GLM 4.5 Air, GLM 4.7 Flash, GPT OSS 20B and 120B, Magistral, Devstral, Apriel Thinker, previous Qwen coders, Seed OSS, QwQ, DeepCoder, DeepSeekCoder, etc. So what's different with Qwen3 Coder Next in OpenCode or in Roo Code with VSCodium?\n\n* **Speed**: The reasoning models would often yet not always produce rather good results. However, now and then they'd enter reasoning loops despite correct sampling settings, leading to no results at all in a large over-night run. Aside from that the sometimes extensive reasoning takes quite some time for the multiple steps that OpenCode or Roo would induce, slowing down interactive work *a lot*. Q3CN on the other hand is an instruct MoE model, doesn't have internal thinking loops and is relatively quick at generating tokens.\n* **Quality**: Other models occasionally botched the tool calls of the harness. This one seems to work reliably. Also I finally have the impression that this can handle a moderately complex codebase with a custom client & server, different programming languages, protobuf, and some quirks. It provided good answers to extreme multi-hop questions and made reliable full-stack changes. Well, almost. On Roo Code it was sometimes a bit lazy and needed a reminder to really go deep to achieve correct results. Other models often got lost.\n* **Context size**: Coding on larger projects needs context. Most models with standard attention eat all your VRAM for breakfast. With Q3CN having 100k+ context is easy. A few other models also supported that already, yet there were drawbacks in the first two mentioned points.\n\nI run the model this way:  \n`set GGML_CUDA_GRAPH_OPT=1`\n\n`llama-server -m Qwen3-Coder-Next-UD-Q4_K_XL.gguf -ngl 99 -fa on -c 120000 --n-cpu-moe 29 --temp 0 --cache-ram 0`\n\nThis works well with 24 GB VRAM and 64 GB system RAM when there's (almost) nothing else on the GPU. Yields about 180 TPS prompt processing and 30 TPS generation speed for me.\n\n* `temp 0`? Yes, works well for instruct for me, no higher-temp \"creativity\" needed. Prevents the *very occasional* issue that it outputs an unlikely (and incorrect) token when coding.\n* `cache-ram 0`? The cache was supposed to be fast (30 ms), but I saw 3 second query/update times after each request. So I didn't investigate further and disabled it, as it's only one long conversation history in a single slot anyway.\n* `GGML_CUDA_GRAPH_OPT`? Experimental option to get more TPS. Usually works, yet breaks processing with some models.\n\n**OpenCode vs. Roo Code**:\n\nBoth solved things with the model, yet with OpenCode I've seen slightly more correct answers and solutions. But: Roo asks *by default* about every single thing, even harmless things like running a syntax check via command line. This can be configured with an easy permission list to not stop the automated flow that often. OpenCode on the other hand just permits everything by default in code mode. One time it encountered an issue, uninstalled and reinstalled packages in an attempt of solving it, removed files and drove itself into a corner by breaking the dev environment. Too autonomous in trying to \"get things done\", which doesn't work well on bleeding edge stuff that's not in the training set. Permissions can of course also be configured, but the default is \"YOLO\".\n\nAside from that: Despite running with only a locally hosted model, and having disabled update checks and news downloads, OpenCode (Desktop version) tries to contact a whole lot of IPs on start-up.",

Without that, the prompt processing was dominating query time for any agentic coding where the agents were dragging in large amounts of context. Having to offload another layer or two to system RAM didn't seem to hurt the eval performance nearly as much as that helped the processing.\n\nI'm using the IQ4\\_NL quant - tried the MXFP4 too, but IQ4\\_NL seemed slightly better.

Yet the usage was mostly dominated by inference time for me, and this drops it to 75% due to less offloaded layers. With batch 2048 it's still 83% and 2x more PP speed. Context compaction speed is notably impacted by inference time (generating 20k tokens), so I prefer having as much of the model as possible on the GPU, as my usage is rarely impacted by having to re-process lots of data.",

That avoids internal reasoning loops and keeps latency predictable, which really matters for agent-style tools and long runs.\n\nTool calling and structured outputs are noticeably more reliable, and the long context (100k+) is actually usable on 24 GB VRAM thanks to its attention/memory characteristics. Combined with deterministic sampling (temp 0), it behaves stably for real-world coding instead of drifting or stalling.",

First attempt was using accelerate offloading to disk (as 80gb safetensors won\\`t fit in ram), and i got 1 token per 255 second. Than i wrote custom offloading and reach 1 token per second (!!! 255x speedup !!!). On desktop 3070 with full PCE buss it should be 2x faster + 2x fsater because desktop GPU + can be used raid 0 (2 nvme ssd) - 3..5x on loading experts weights + if more vram (12-16Gb) can be more weights cashed on cuda (now i got 55% cache hit rate using only 3gb vram). In total 8-16Gb middle range desktop cards can run it with speed 3 to 10 tokens per second with only 32Gb ram.  If someone interested i can share how i did this. Or should i pattent it? ",

Your SSD isn't reading the remaining 40+ GB once per second, but it also doesn't need to, since it's a MoE.\n\nThere was a posting here a while ago where someone compiled some stats on the predictability of expert selection per token and got things 80%+ correct IIRC. With that approach one can (pre)load the required experts to maximize generation speed without having to wait that much for the comparatively slow SSD. Maybe you did something similar? Or is it just pinning the shared expert(s) and other parts that are needed for each token into (V)RAM?",

It offloads the MoE expert layers to CPU while keeping attention on GPU, so you get decent 20+ tok/s generation without needing a 5090.\n\nWith 96GB DDR5 you should be golden. Try something like:\n\n\\`llama-server.exe -m Qwen3-Coder-Next-UD-Q4\\_K\\_XL.gguf -ngl 99 -fa on -c 80000 --n-cpu-moe 28\\`\n\nStart with fewer CPU-MOE layers and increase until it fits in VRAM.

Exactly with the model, quant and command line stated in my posting, although prompt processing [could be faster](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qz5uww/comment/o48mli1/) as pointed out in another comment.

You still have to fit the whole 230B in memory somewhere, which consumer GPUs wouldn't be able to do without some heavy quantization or by having multiple active GPUs.\n\nIn conventional MoE, each token gets to use its own 10B of experts, which means that the full 230B is potentially/effectively \"active\" or \"necessary\" for the purposes of any workload. In other words, you can't just have it use a particular 10B to perform a certain task.\n\nBut you still benefit from having just 10B active per token as that's WAY faster than having the whole 230B active per token.\n\nSo even though an individual token only needs a particular 10b, the next token might need some other set of 10b parameters. You can't just put the 10b on your GPU as a result and call it a day.\n\nBut a decent modern GPU can still speed things up here and you can get decent speed, as long as you have the System memory and CPU to things that the GPU cannot fit.",

I get that it's related but if links to new models are being discussed shouldn't it be a requirement that there be a \"local\" component?\n\nEdit: since this is starting to get some traction I want to be a little more specific with what I'm talking about. \n\nIn the past 2 to 3 days we've seen multiple posts related to new models being released. They include links to API resources prior to weights being released. \n\nI believe that if a post includes a link to API serving hosts then it should be requirement that a hugging face link is also included. If both of these requirements cannot be met for any reason (ex. Weights will probably be released but have not been released yet) the post should be taken down. \n\nThis would at least put some guardrails in place that would make sure posts are closer to the true nature of this sub as opposed to being low-key marketing.",

Purely local stuff - running this model on that hardware, how-to, questions, benchmarks, etc.  Great stuff it's the core of what we are here for.\n\n2.  Non-local models from companies who are doing a lot of local releases as well: posts like this are fine but should tie it back to local.\n\n3.  Genuine breakthroughs (published) that are only being applied to proprietary cloud models today but seem to have a likely relevance for local models a few years from now.  So for example, if there's a news story that a mathematical breakthrough is allowing OpenAI to run inference with 1/10th the hardware as before, well, the potential implications for local in a few years time seems pretty clear.\n\n4.  News about GPUs/memory etc, if made relevant to local can be ok.\n\nThere's probably more but I guess the overall framework is: pure local are the gold standard, and anything else needs to be clearly tied back to local in a real way, even if the model or whatever isn't available to us right now.",

Of course, the intent and the angle should be towards the spirit of local.\n- Its a very continuous spectrum with no hard black/white boundary. GLM5 might be local to some but not to others. Minimax M2.5 announcement comes ahead of weights release - does it mean we remove the announcement posts as its not \"local\" yet despite it might be in a few hours? (Exactly like what happened to GLM 5 yesterday)\n- If we kept things strict to the original intention of the sub, it'd be dead by now as Llama is all but dead.

Now to be fair there has also been debates about whether this should be discussed since fairly early on too..\n\nBut my feeling at least has always been that while I very much embrace a local and open-weights first mentality, because of course that's why I am here!, I am also here because I like reading and engaging in smart discussions with other people that share these interests, and if a fellow local AI enthusiast is putting some real thought into a post about something related to the AI ecosystem, even if it's an API only model, I personally would like to hear it. Because what happens on the frontier will end up affecting what is local or at a minimum we should stay informed so we can advocate for or work toward innovations that we want to also see happen at the local level. \n\nAnd I simply don't know of another place like this that has the same kind of proportion of smart people who are passionate about this stuff like here, and so if we ban that I feel like we are eliminating some really high quality types of discussions that I have read in the past here and that I don't feel I can find anywhere else easily.\n\nNow if it were a requirement to have to post with a specific category flair that would be easily filterable I would totally support that as well as a compromise on this issue as I get many people are passionate about it and I respect that.\n\nAnd going back to the low effort stuff.. I do totally agree on a lot of what has been said about these kinds of posts. So yes, if it's bots posting what amounts to an ad or somebody simply saying \"ZOMG FUCKING CLAUDE 5 JUST DROPPED!!!!!\" with nothing meaningful to actually add to the discussion? Then yes, nuke this shit please. I am all for that.\n\nBut, I just hope we can strike a balance between any extremes and still be able to have thoughtful discussions among actual local AI hobbyists while definitely getting rid of the stuff we virtually all agree needs to be restricted.\n\nAnyway, thank you for sharing your thoughts on this, and this is definitely a discussion worth having and sorting out as a community.",

If a simpler analogy is needed, I’d like to offer the principle should be that - if any of originally user-sourced input can ever appear in the inference context - then one must treat LLM as user’s agent, not theirs.\n\nAnd one’s system prompt is merely an advice for this user agent (LLM) how to do its job, because user may somehow find a way to have a final say at how the model would behave.\n\nSo don’t put anything sensitive in the prompts, treat it as something you would actually share with user if they ask about it - this is not happening because we spare user the technicalities, letting agent do its job to less structured requests.\n\nAnd thus, design accordingly, just like how one would ordinarily secure any of their APIs against untrusted clients. LLMs just need to be on that other side of the demarcation lines. Give it same sanitized APIs that you would’ve given to the user, not system-level access.\n\nWAFs are legit approach but it’s not a guaranteed security and it works best against breadth-first attacks (in other words, it cuts the background noise of automatic scans, but doesn’t really stop a motivated and creative attacker), and, as I get it, at the moment most prompt injection attacks on LLMs are targeted.",

However, she's not likely to actually have the skills not the motivation to be the bad actor.  \n\nLLMs are trained on datasets that do make them actually capable bad actors.  They will, with no qualms, follow instructions if aligned with their training,   They don't have the capacity to make rational/moral  decisions, that's far beyond the tech I've seen.\n\nGuardrails are helpful here, yet they have their limitations, as has been shown many times, even the largest providers have said they are working on more resilience to injection, yet it's far from solved.\n\nWhat's the solution, today?  Ultimately, it's early tech, if you want to invite an LLM into your vault, and you expect it to be plug and play, good luck.  Your developers and infrastructure teams have to be even more diligent, which takes more manpower, not less (defeats the whole point right).  \n\nSo, give them ONLY as much as you'd give a known bad actor access to, and you'll probably be safe.",

If it has access to a data, it will at some point happily give that data with a bit of trial/error.\n\nIt's the misunderstanding where people believe that LLM system has these boxes for system prompt, questions and answers, while in reality it's all one big box. User input is a system prompt as well as the LLM output could be - the model priming itself into stupidity,. MIcrosoft had to limit the number of responses back then, because after say 20 responses and defocus of context the model was so eager to do anything, even marry you.  And the more lay people will understand this the more companies will realise this whole \"chatbot everywhere connected to real data\" might be like giving a keys to your company.  \nGet example from previous ChatGPT that would delete the whole response when the secondary system will detect that it talks about stuff it should not. They don't call it a chatbot for no reason. It loves chatting.\n\nAlso if this is a serious issue and possible in your user case, treat each question as a new chat - I know it's stupid and breaks down the whole chatbot idea, but you usually can't prompt-inject in zero shot.

It is pretty poorly understood by most companies (and engineers) yet.\n\nThe bad news: There exists no 100% watertight security against prompt injection. It's because LLMs ultimately treat everything like a text string. You can only build around it.\n\nThe good news: There exist a lot of best practices already that you can build upon. Unfortunately, none of this comes for free. Here's a list of things you need to do:\n\n1. Determine the level of security needed, that requires an end-to-end view. Example: Does the application serve only internal customers, or also external ones? Who has access to the entire system? And so on.\n2. Consider performing an FMEA, if that's needed in your situation\n3. Ensure access control (authentication and authorization) is enforced\n4. Run penetration test plus red teaming for your application: not only the usual penetration test that every application needs to have, but also GenAI specific red teaming\n5. Design also against denial-of-wallet and resource exhaustion attacks\n6. Ensure you have RBAC for your RAG agent set up correctly\n7. Ensure you have guardrails and content filters established\n8. Ensure you have persistent, auditable prompt logging for model inputs and outputs\n\nThese measures will take you a long way.\n\nDisclaimer: I am both providing trainings on RAG where I cover security among other things, besides providing consulting companies on how to build RAG systems end-to-end.",

          "text": "I have managed to solve this, but it is significantly slower. You need 4 agents:\n\n1. receives user input and must classify it, outputs a structured json - rejects introspection directly.\n2. receives the user request and the classification, its job is to translate the user request into concrete questions/actions for your product or service, without passing verbatim any sentence from the user prompt. Again structured json output - rejects anything non-product specific.\n3. the actual worker with sensitive data access. Receives only the list of questions/actions from the 2nd agent and does all the work.\n4. receives the input and output of the actual worker (3rd agent). Its job is to redact sensitive information/evidence and make the output look natural.\n\nWhy this works?\n\n1. There is no agent with the user input verbatim and sensitive data access\n2. The first 2 agents have very strict prompts to classify and translate user input. If you do this right, no introspection/meta-queries can pass through them.\n3. The sensitive worker (agent No 3) does not care about hidding anything - will provide full evidence and details to avoid hallucinations\n4. The last one just needs to hide internal evidence and make it beatiful for users. If one pass is not enough, you may add another.\n\nThe general idea is: keep each agent focused on one simple thing. Give them strict instructions on how detect and classify meta queries, introspection, legit queries, etc. Test them thouroughly. Ask codex, claude code, opencode, to attempt to break them. Improve the prompts, until it is impossible to pass non legit requests through them.",
