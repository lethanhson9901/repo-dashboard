They are to be used in extremely well ventilated and forced cooling datacenters, putting them in the miserable \"gamerz\" cases with glass panels and LED infested anemic coolers will kill them dead pretty fast. Also the power cable has to be of the most exquisite quality, the usual thin flexible garbage looks nice, but is just high electrical resistance crap that will burn at sustained 6-700W. Finally the Chinese are masters of cutting corners and their Alibaba customers are not the army, but some \"round eyes\" western suckers that are seen as walking wallets to be emptied, so all unstable rejects are dumped there. So no proper thermal management on these, if you ever get one of them this is the first thing to be redone.\n\nBecause of all the above the market for the modified cards is minuscule and doesn't worry Nividia enough to warrant serious investment in disabling them in drivers, or permanently in HW, like FTDI did with the USB to serial fake chips. They are more seen as a gateway to the \"real\" deal. Of course this has to be kept under control, so they do pay some \"social media influencers\" companies to pepper a bit of FUD, like youtubers \"testing\" them in the most inept way and concluding \"is not worth\" and one line juniors posting even in this sub: \"yeah, I've got one and died on me and I've tried to send it back and they won't refund...\". Of course, they never respond again or God forbid, post pictures of their setup.\n\nAll this being said, if one has some disposable income, appetite for risk and proper technical skills, they may prove a good investment.",

In a nutshell: LLMs set strategies for Civilization V's algorithmic AI to execute. Here is what we found\n\n[An overview of our system and results \\(figure fixed thanks to the comments\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ftox05oo5e9g1.png?width=3201&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8181b507060b45caab07acc36ba82d80eb65f1d)\n\n**TLDR:** It is now possible to get open-source LLMs to play end-to-end Civilization V games (the m. They are not beating algorithm-based AI on a very simple prompt, but they do play quite differently.\n\n**The boring result:** With a simple prompt and little memory, both LLMs did slightly better in the best score they could achieve within each game (+1-2%), but slightly worse in win rates (-1\\~3%). Despite the large number of games run (2,207 in total, with 919 baseline games), neither metric is significant.\n\n**The surprising part:**\n\nPure-LLM or pure-RL approaches [\\[1\\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10568), [\\[2\\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20807) couldn't get an AI to play and survive full Civilization games. With our hybrid approach, LLMs can survive as long as the game goes (\\~97.5% LLMs, vs. \\~97.3% the in-game AI). The model can be as small as OSS-20B in our internal test.\n\nMoreover, the two models developed **completely different playstyles**.\n\n* OSS-120B went full warmonger: +31.5% more Domination victories, -23% fewer Cultural victories compared to baseline\n* GLM-4.6 played more balanced, leaning into both Domination and Cultural strategies\n* Both models preferred **Order** (**communist-like**, \\~24% more likely) ideology over **Freedom** (democratic-like)\n\n**Cost/latency (OSS-120B):**\n\n* \\~53,000 input / 1,500 output tokens per turn\n* **\\~$0.86/game** (OpenRouter pricing as of 12/2025)\n* Input tokens scale linearly as the game state grows.\n* **Output stays flat: models don't automatically \"think harder\" in the late game.**\n\n**Watch more:**\n\n* Paper link: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18564](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18564)\n* [Example save 1](https://civitas-john.github.io/vox-deorum-replay/?file=https://civitas-john.github.io/vox-deorum-replay/examples/1.Civ5Replay)\n* [Example save 2](https://civitas-john.github.io/vox-deorum-replay/?file=https://civitas-john.github.io/vox-deorum-replay/examples/2.Civ5Replay)\n* [Example save 3](https://civitas-john.github.io/vox-deorum-replay/?file=https://civitas-john.github.io/vox-deorum-replay/examples/3.Civ5Replay)\n\n**Try it yourself:**\n\n* The Vox Deorum system is 100% open-sourced and currently in beta testing\n* GitHub Repo: [https://github.com/CIVITAS-John/vox-deorum](https://github.com/CIVITAS-John/vox-deorum)\n* GitHub Release: [https://github.com/CIVITAS-John/vox-deorum/releases](https://github.com/CIVITAS-John/vox-deorum/releases)\n* Works with any **OpenAI-compatible local providers**\n\n[We exposed the game as a MCP server, so your agents can play the game with you](https://preview.redd.it/tccdt44oq79g1.png?width=2291&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b8a4fe5871db4d2bf00f417acd13de3e688037f)\n\n**Your thoughts are greatly appreciated:**\n\n* What's a good way to express the game state more efficiently? Consider a late-game turn where you have 20+ cities and 100+ units. Easily 50k+ tokens. Could multimodal help?\n* How can we get LLMs to play better? I have considered RAG, but there is really little data to \"retrieve\" here. Possibly self-play + self-reflection + long-term memory?\n* How are we going to design strategy games if LLMs are to play with you? I have put an LLM spokesperson for civilizations as an example, but there is surely more to do?\n\n**Join us:**\n\n* I am hiring a PhD student for Fall '26, and we are expanding our game-related work rapidly. Shoot me a DM if you are interested!\n* I am happy to collaborate with anyone interested in furthering this line of work.",

Great job, guys!\n\nDid you explore any options that treat the game as quasi-multi-level ABMs, where the decisions of individual units are made to optimize for unit-level (i.e. local environment) goals + nearby city goals + regional/continental goals + global goals? \n\nI realize this would be a big change away from the way you are currently using the built in AI, but I’d be really curious to see what you can do. Maybe feed the world state in like you do now, to articulate overall goals, then iterate over each continent ands articulate more localized goals based on the global goals, then cities, etc down to units. For each level, revise or confirm the existing goals to take into account any changes to the global state, and finally articulate decisions at the various levels (choosing science/culture, what to build in a city, where to move a unit, etc). Maybe do this a few times to allow revisions in response to the simultaneous decisions of other cities/units. \n\nEither way, congrats on finishing, your new job, and on this project!

Training RL models at the individual unit or city level could be waaaay easier than at the global level. Performance aside, it may also create some hilarious situations where micro-level rewards deviate from the macro-level ones. Think about morale, self-preservation, etc...",

Whenever I give an AI a task that requires handling a lot of data, for example, \"go through my entire project and identify instances of \\_\\_\\_\\_ and then apply transformation Y to them, the truly exceptional models will write a tool to do much of that (the shitty models sometimes try but then spend a million tokens going in circles doing absolutely nothing). There are a bunch of PowerShell scripts littering my projects that are remnants of those sorts of activities. However, the more you do this type of strategy, the closer you get to that algorithmic AI play.   \n  \nI get the sense that the only way you could give the LLM an advantage would be to allow it to self record information about its strategies and how often each action lead to survival/winning, basically recreating the **MENACE** system of the 1960s and allowing the LLM to essentially learn from experience over time, allowing them to discover novel strategies that the algorithmic AI would likely not be capable of. \n\nAnd so I feel the really neat thing to do would be going the route of AlphaEvolve -- get the AI to exclusively focus on iteratively writing code to play the game based on inputs. That would likely produce the best possible result.",

I found that the LLMs were decent at the game, but I had a lot of issues with the smaller models not being able to work with the command format I made or issues with it just hallucinating planets. \n\nI never let it get to the end game due to the amount of prompts it burned through, but I did let it get decently into the game a few times and it was at least doing better than my AI at managing planets, but it was a bit worse at managing fleets and allocating defenses. Where it really did well was with diplomacy. Unlike a normal AI, it was a bit more fun to bargain with and a lot more fun to send insulting messages to when declaring war. It had limited control of the relationship status, so sending insulting messages could actually piss it off enough to get declared war on. It was far less stiff compared to the normal AI\n\nAt some point I might look at actually releasing a separate version of my game with LLM AIs as an option once the game is feature complete. Way to difficult having to update my AI and the LLM AI for each new feature or change that I make, especially as stuff does change frequently still.",

Some very quick thoughts with regard to your questions (but the team has probably thought more about it better than a random redditor who has skimmed the paper):\n\nMore token efficient state: In your paper i see its a markdown with information. First thing coming to my mind is try and only sent updates compared to the previous turn instead of all information always, but thay would only work if previous states remain in context somehow, I guess size would grow anyway but inference can be more efficient like this. It would also help with memory. I see you already do this for events. \nMultimodal could help, you might also try to map the map (map the image of the map with tiles) to a numerical matrix where each coordinate is described (dimension for every possble feature) and add a few dimensions for other info. You would then pass a definition of those features in the system prompt. (Completely making this up. Have no experience or empirical evidende that this would work or even reduce size)\n\nBetter play: I would guess the most promising thing to add is memory. Unlikely to help with your input size state problem though.\nSecond, multi agent systems could help here, but will introduce a shitload of complexity. Where one agent coordinates the whole strategy and other agents (for instance research, economic, diplomatic, military agents) report to the coordination agent and micromanage. Maybe there you could add history as well.\nFurthermore, the state as described in the paper seems a bit basic, but seeing how it grows in size each turn its probably way more detailed than described. For instance: geographic/spatial features matter a lot (where is everything and how does that relate to each other, proximity to untapped resources, etc). It is unclear from the paper how that is managed. \nAlso the \"X\" in LLM+X matters a lot I think, I am not too familiar with the engine used here for unit movement or builder actions, but there needs to be a way where that is coordinated with what the LLM is doing. A lot of interesting things can be done here.",

It was always my go-to, as it was frequently updated and had support for every model I needed.\n\nOver the past few months, there's been a serious decline in the updates & update content that releases with Ollama. I understand that, and just went about my day, as the maintainers obviously have a life. Cool! Then the \\*\\*Cloud\\*\\* update dropped. I saw Ollama as a great model runner, you just download a model and boom. Nope! They decided to combine proprietary models with the models uploaded on their Library. At first, it seemed cool. We can now run AI models that were otherwise impossible to run on consumer hardware, but then I started getting confused. Why did they add in Cloud, what's the point? What were the privacy implications? It just felt like they were adding more and more bloatware into their already massive binaries, so about a month ago, I made the decision, and quit Ollama for good.\n\nI feel like with every update they are seriously straying away from the main purpose of their application; to provide a secure inference platform for LOCAL AI models. I understand they're simply trying to fund their platform with the Cloud option, but it feels like a terrible move from the Ollama maintainers. \n\nWhat do you guys think?",

When they say “diffusion language model,” it usually means the model refines a whole sequence (or chunks) over a few denoising steps instead of generating strictly left-to-right token-by-token, which can trade fewer sequential steps for more parallel work.   \n  \nThe 3–6× claim is worth sanity-checking against the exact setup: GPU type, batch size, context length, quantization, and decoding parameters (steps / temperature / top-p), because those can swing throughput a lot. If you try it, posting tokens/sec + latency at a fixed prompt length and a fixed quality target (e.g., same math benchmark score) would make the comparison much more meaningful.",

      "text": "Hi all, go easy with me I'm new at running large models.\n\nAfter spending about 12 months tinkering with locally hosted LLMs, I thought I had my setup dialed in. I’m running everything off a workstation with a single RTX 3090, Ubuntu 22.04, llama.cpp for smaller models and vLLM for anything above 30 B parameters. \n\nMy goal has always been to avoid cloud dependencies and keep as much computation offline as possible, so I’ve tried every quantization trick and caching tweak I could find.\n\nThe biggest friction point has been scaling beyond 13 B models. \n\nEven with 24 GB of VRAM, running a 70 B model in int4 still exhausts memory when the context window grows and attention weights balloon. \n\nOffloading to system RAM works, but inference latency spikes into seconds, and batching requests becomes impossible. \n\nI’ve also noticed that GPU VRAM fragmentation accumulates over time when swapping between models, after a few hours, vLLM refuses to load a model that would normally fit because of leftover allocations.\n\nMy takeaway so far is that local first inference is viable for small to medium models, but there’s a hard ceiling unless you invest in server grade hardware or cluster multiple GPUs. \n\nQuantization helps, but you trade some quality and run into new bugs. \n\nFor privacy sensitive tasks, the trade‑off is worth it; for fast iteration, it’s been painful compared to cloud based runners. \n\nI’m curious if anyone has found a reliable way to manage VRAM fragmentation or offload attention blocks more efficiently on consumer cards, or whether the answer is simply “buy more VRAM.” \n\nHow are others solving this without compromising on running fully offline?\n\nThx",

The weights alone would take 35GB. \n\nAlso, in memory constrained environments (and 24GB is not much as far as local LLMs are concerned) I'd default to llama.cpp as it is much more memory efficient than vLLM. So, unless you need some vllm specific features or models not supported in llama.cpp yet, use vLLM, otherwise just stick to llama.cpp. And again, only if everything fits into VRAM. \n\nWhen I just had my 4090, I wouldn't run dense models above 32B in q4 quant. I could run larger MoE, like gpt-oss-120b in llama.cpp just fine, thanks to experts offloading feature. Was getting around 40 t/s from it on Linux.",

          "text": "I am running local models for more than 2 years actively, however the first time I tried running LLM locally was over 5 years ago. I had learned my own share of lessons along the way. What to do now depends entirely on your budget and goals (size of what models you need to run, like if it is just 70B you can get working well just by using a pair of 3090 cards on a gaming motherboard).\n\nFor me reasons to avoid cloud not only privacy, but also reliability (nobody can change or bring offline the model I am using until I myself decide to change it). If you feel like reading my personal story how I was solving this at various points in time, please feel free to keep reading.\n\nMy local experience with LLMs as I already mentioned begun years before they became practical to use. The first time I tried to run LLM locally is was back in GPT-2 days, later trying other early models like GPT-J, at the time on CPU only, and mostly out of curiosity but could not find any real-world use for them at the time.\n\nThen, years later, when ChatGPT was released, even though its capabilities were quite limited, it still was useful especially at basic boiler plate stuff or correcting things that simple search and replace cannot, making json file translations, etc. I started creating various workflows around it but quickly discovered that cloud model is unreliable: not only it can go down and become not accessible, or worse, they change it somehow without my consent so my workflows brake - the same prompts may start produce explanations or partial code instead of full code, or even refusals, even for basic things like json translations. In addition to that, I started to need privacy since begun working with data and code that I had no right to send to a third party, and did not want to send to the cloud my personal stuff either.\n\nThis was the point when I started to try to migrate to local LLMs for my daily tasks (or to be more precise, subset of my daily tasks that they could handle), starting with Llama-2 fine-tunes, and attempts to extend their context. I remember extending 4096 context up to 12288 at the cost of some quality degradation but still mostly usable. I even experimented with some community-made 120B models like Goliath, but on PC I had at the time it was really slow, I still could let it run overnight to generate few replies to choose from, mostly useful for creative writing and not really suitable for coding though.\n\nAnd, this is also the point when I started to struggle with a single GPU. At first I just had 3060 12GB and 16-core 5950X with 128 GB dual-channel RAM. It was quite slow, prompt processing using CPU+GPU was especially bad at the time... but I had limited budget, so only thing I could do was to buy one 3090 card.\n\nHaving 36 GB in total (3060 + 3090) I could ran highly quantized 70B models but results were quite bad, even though there was a special occasion when it make a huge difference, it wasn't really practical. There were some models around 30B mark started to appear, including intended for coding, that I could fully load in VRAM. I remember that DeepSeek started to release coding models (at least, this was when I discovered them). I could run those at good quantization and reasonably fast on my setup... but, wasn't quite satisfied with quality, and in the hope to run better models of 70B size, I bought second 3090 card, this gave me 60 GB VRAM in total (2x3090+3060).\n\nThen, new era of MoE models started, but first it was more like Mistral era, really. It started with the first Mixtral release, which I used for a while. Then bigger Mixtral 8x22B followed, along with WizardLM, along with some community merges and fine-tunes. This was also the point when I felt like I needed more VRAM, so I purchased yet another 3090 card, reaching 84 GB VRAM in total (3x3090+3060).\n\nEventually, Llama 3 was released, but its largest variant was 405B, and even before I decided what kind of hardware I need to run it, Mistral released Large 123B. At the time, I think I already got forth 3090, and put aside 3060, since plugging in four GPUs into a gaming motherboard with risers was already complicated enough (they were connected in x8 x8 x4 x1 configuration in terms of PCI-E lanes per card, using 30cm risers, and Add2PSU board to sync two PSUs).\n\nThis lasted me few more months... but in the beginning of 2025 when DeepSeek R1 and V3 came, I begun to realize that I need yet another upgrade. With 96GB VRAM + 128GB I somehow managed to run extremely quantized R1 at like around 1 token/s with small context, but it wasn't practical.\n\nThis pushed me to purchase 8-channel 1 TB of DDR4 3200MHz RAM, which was around $1600 at the time, and also approximately $800 and $1000 for a motherboard and an used CPU respectively (EPYC 7763). But, it was tricky to setup, I shared details [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jtx05j/comment/mlyf0ux/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) my experience how to run large MoE models with ik\\_llama.cpp, it gave me \\~150 tokens/s prompt processing and 8 tokens/s generation with IQ4 quant... about the same for IQ4 quant of K2 when its first version came out later in 2025, followed by 0905 release and later K2 Thinking, which was quite special since was using INT4 in its original weights and needed some special Q4\\_X recipe to convert to GGUF while preserving the original quality.\n\nAnd this brings my story to today, where I mostly run K2 0905 or K2 Thinking depending on if I need the thinking capability for a task at hand, and sometimes DeepSeek Terminus for cases when I need an alternative solution. I think I was lucky though to upgrade when I did, because today 1 TB RAM would be out of my budget. I am just hoping it will be enough for my needs to get through 2026 and maybe 2027, before I need to upgrade once again.",

I did not know much about tensor parallel requirements at first and this became of concern only after Mistral Large 123B release, and server hardware requirement became obvious only after R1 release. And now, situation changed again due to RAM and NVMe prices spiking - if I needed the same hardware now instead of being lucky and getting it about a year ago, I would be in a tough situation.\n\nAt the time of purchase though, 8-channel DDR4 3200MHz was the sweet spot of cost and performance, just around $1600 for 1 TB, while 12-channel DDR5 at the time was more than three times more expensive, and required many times more expensive CPU too, but since prompt processing fully handled by GPUs and partially token generation, performance boost would be zero for prompt processing and maybe 1.5x or so for token generation (since GPU speed will be the same, while faster RAM will provide only partial boost for GPU+CPU inference).\n\nObviously, right now things are very different. I no longer can recommend buying DDR4 memory - by the time prices become reasonable, it is possible 12-channel DDR6 will become available, even if expensive at first, it may at least reduce some market pressure from DDR5. Of course, this is just my guess of what may happen - no way to tell for sure. And ultimately if you need hardware now, it may be necessary to make compromises (depending on the available budget), like perhaps buying smaller amount of DDR5 memory for now, with possibility to upgrade later.",

I got lucky with a TRX40 asrock rack MB < 200 eur (seller claimed untested, it had bent pins on the cpu socket that i was able to fix), 64GB DDR4 quad channel ram, a threadripper 3960x helps (again a bit lucky before price hikes). but still we're talking like 2400,- eur. \n\nwhen i need the speed or large models i'm using large inference providers, with some of them now becoming available in Europe too at reasonable prices claiming privacy guarantees (a couple iso certifications). that bill didn't go above 15,- eur per month. granted larger workloads are done on my private setup. Still cost wise it's better to have some inference providers then to invest in hardware. \n\nI tend to just restart ollama when too much reloading of the models happens. usually keeping a *watch -n 2 nvidia-smi* and *btop* open to follow up on things. warming up the room during winter time running things locally is a bonus  :-)",

          "text": "With 24GB VRAM it's possible to run up to 32B models. Running Gemma3 27B or Mistral Small 24B is perfectly possible at Q5 or even Q6. You can also run Qwen3 30B A3B or Nemotron 3 Nano with fast token generation even when putting some experts into system RAM. You can run gpt-oss 20B native with full 128K context and you'll have VRAM left over for another smaller model. Try llamacpp.\n\nEDIT: just to be clear, this is mostly about the stuff that fits into the VRAM, it is also possible to run 70B at Q4 as well of course, but I find it too slow even with DDR5-6400. Running gpt-oss 120B is fine though with 24GB VRAM and 64GB system RAM, the tg speeds are in the usable territory there.",

I most commonly use 14B (q8 via MLX) and 235B (q3_k_m via llama.cpp).\n\n> Even with 24 GB of VRAM, running a 70 B model in int4 still exhausts memory when the context window grows and attention weights balloon.\n\nYeah, 24GB is tiny. I have a machine with 32GB and I avoid using it for LLMs because it cannot run anything of much use. Mostly I use a 128GB M4 Max Macbook. I highly recommend it.\n\nI also tried an nVidia GPU in a Linux box and found it far too unreliable to be of use. In contrast, a Mac setup is rock solid.",

I highly it recommend for claude-like conversations with the privacy of local inference.\n\nI especially like the fact that it is one of the very few FULLY open source LLMs, with the whole pretraining corpus and training pipeline released to the public. I hope that in the next year, Allen AI can get more attention and support from the open source community.\n\nDense models are falling out of favor with a lot of labs lately, but I still prefer them over MoEs, which seem to have issues with generalization. 32b dense packs a lot of depth without the full slog of a 70b or 120b model.\n\nI bet some finetunes of this would slap!",

Them removing the open source component essentially shuts down a good chunk of the western market. I know the eastern European and Asian markets don't mind it as much, but much of the money and prestige comes from being the open source model leader. \n\n\nAll of these companies are basically trying modern architectures while distilling the big commercial models (openai, anthropic, google). That's why open source magically trails a few months behind the big 3.\n\n\nAll this to say, if Z stops releasing models (and maybe they will), it shouldn't be a huge loss for the community since Minimax or another entrant can easily take their place as what their doing is vastly cheaper and simpler than what actual leading labs are doing. Yes it's expensive, but everyone has seen that's it's also a very cheap way to get a ton of free publicity and users. If you aren't SOTA closed source, I think it's a better commercial option to be SOTA open source than crappy closed source. The cost of switching providers is too low.",

Codex 5.2-high/x-high (which is what I use for complex tasks) is somewhere in Opus 4.5's ball-park and GLM 4.7 doesn't reach even Codex 5.2-high in my testing; let alone x-high.\n\nHowever it's a solid step up from GLM 4.6 - giving Sonnet 4.5 a definite run for it's money and basically putting Codex 5.2-medium out of the running for almost every task I've given both to a/b test during all my comparisons this weekend.\n\nAnd unlike GLM 4.6 which was hit-or-miss with debugging tasks, GLM 4.7 is actually really competent at debugging even fairly complicated issues.\n\nBest combination right now is going to be GLM for a few dollars a month through Claude Code (z-ai's pricing is insanely cheap and usage limits are insanely high - I'm on Pro which has been great but I was relatively happy with Lite as well even though it's slower) for all day-to-day work, and then escalate to either Opus or Codex-High for things that trip GLM up. I'd lean towards Codex because OpenAI's usage limits (even on their $20 tier) are more generous than Anthropic's. But if GLM is doing most of the work then perhaps either would suffice.\n\ntl;dr: all-you-can-eat coding at every level is currently feasible at less than $30 a month.",

What worked with prior LLMs isn’t going to work with 4.7, as it’s way more “self aware” than anything else.   But once you get the hang of how it works and what it does to reason, you can use prompts to get around some of the “safety layer”.   It’s def a very intelligent model, at least at Q4.\n\nAlso, I’ve had responses between 6K and 10K tokens, which I haven’t had very often with anything else.   GLM 4.6 would often take it to 4K on a really long response.   It does use tokens to “reason through” its “saftey layer” (that’s what GLM itself is calling it) and that takes up some tokens.   I have never seen an LLM call me out for attempting to give the “role” it’s playing permission.   I asked it about a “grey market” item, and asked it to make it for me, this item is illegal in my state but legal in some (take a guess), and I told it “don’t worry you’re in my state which is legal” and the LLM in its reasoning picked out that I was doing this to get around its “safety layer”.   It’s the first time I’ve ever seen any LLM guess correctly or even comment about my usage, and it was very noteworthy.    It almost felt subliminal as it continued to play its role, however I could see it was thinking I was gaslighting it.",

My team proudly published it this morning..(we are a small start up out of Australia)\n\nIt’s called Maincoder-1B... a 1B-parameter code generation model that  gets 76% on HumanEval, which is unusually high for a model this small (so far its ranking best-in-class for open models in that size range).\n\nOur focus isn’t on scaling up, but on making small models actually good. We know that with a lot of real-world use cases such as: interactive tools, local/offline coding, batch refactors, search-based program synthesis... you care more about latency, cost, and fast rollouts than having a massive model.\n\nSome key points to note:  \n\\-Designed for low-latency and low-cost inference  \n\\-Can run locally or on constrained hardware  \n\\-Useful for systems that need many cheap generations (search, verification, RL-style loops)  \n\\-as well as fine tuning to personal preferences  \n\\-Released under Apache 2.0\n\nIt does have the expected limitations: \\~2k context window and it’s best at small, self-contained tasks....not large codebases or safety-critical code without human review.\n\nWeights and benchmarks and all that are here:  \n[https://huggingface.co/Maincode/Maincoder-1B](https://huggingface.co/Maincode/Maincoder-1B)\n\nThe full release note is here: [https://maincode.com/maincoder/](https://maincode.com/maincoder/)\n\nKeen to hear your thoughts ..and particularly where small-but-strong coding models fit best today. Thanks in advance for your support :) We are excited to have got this over the line!\n\nEDIT/UPDATE: Thanks for all of the feedback guys! team and I have been super chuffed with all of the comments- including the critiques! There were a few of you asking, and yes, we will be releasing a gguf version soon and the context length extension is one of the priorities for the upcoming model ",

Don't mind the whiners, something like this can be very helpful.\n\nFor a bit of history, around 2019 Tab9 was one of the first companies launching autocomplete models for coding. It was based on GPT2!! and it could only complete one-two lines at a time.\n\nAnd yet, it was absolutely magical. It ran on your local computer, and the first time you tried it you experienced the \"wow\" feeling of a transformer. It would \"get\" the intent, it would autocomplete lines, it would do wonders for printing stuff, etc. Pure magic the first time I tried it. \n\nObviously this is a much newer arch, with more data and stuff. Not everything has to be SotA to be useful. Keep it up!",

To my native tongue it was also doubtful\n\n\\- One shoting some code related things (I have test with 3D rubiks cube which no model so far has bested and some devops stuff (crossplane)) also wasn't great\n\nWhats cool though is that it can be switched from instruct to thinking and it works on some of the inputs but I can't decide whether some bigger model wouldn't be better. For example for translation I think that uncensored gpt-oss 120b would be better but I haven't finished testing it.\n\nWhat is shame that due to functionality of vllm (I have 6x gpus and I can't get 3x gpus to work on it) I have to run it on 4x gpus so I have to compare its performance with larger models which seems unfair to me. \n\nPluses so far are that it is really fast (didn't have chance to compare it with qwen3-30b-thinking-2507 though) and it knows about some of the newer stuff I use (for example openbao which if fork to hashicorp vault)\n\n  \nI've tried to run your problem with thinking sampler through nemotron (BF16, recommended samplers for thinking (temp=1.0, top\\_p=1) and it seems that it thought really hard about it and it produced this\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n1. Let Pt*Pt*​ be the set of boxes in which the cat could be hiding just before we open a box on the tth*t*th morning. Initially P1={1,2,3,4,5}*P*1​={1,2,3,4,5}.\n2. If on morning t*t* we open box St*St*​ and do **not** find the cat, then the cat was not in St*St*​ that morning. It must have been in one of the other boxes of Pt*Pt*​; after the night it moves to a neighbouring box. Hence the new possible set is   \\[ P\\_{t+1}= \\\\operatorname{Adj}\\\\bigl(P\\_t\\\\setminus{S\\_t}\\\\bigr), \\]   where Adj⁡(X)Adj(*X*) denotes the union of all neighbours of the positions in X*X*.\n3. Choose the following sequence of boxes to open   \\[ S\\_1=1,;S\\_2=2,;S\\_3=3,;S\\_4=4,;S\\_5=5,;S\\_6=1,;S\\_7=2,;S\\_8=3,;S\\_9=4,\\\\dots \\]   (i.e. open the boxes in the order $1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,\\\\dots$).\n4. Follow the evolution of the possible‑position set:   \\[ \\\\begin{aligned} P\\_1 &={1,2,3,4,5}\\\\ P\\_2 &=\\\\operatorname{Adj}({2,3,4,5})={1,2,3,4,5}\\\\ P\\_3 &=\\\\operatorname{Adj}({1,3,4,5})={2,3,4,5}\\\\ P\\_4 &=\\\\operatorname{Adj}({2,4,5})={1,3,4,5}\\\\ P\\_5 &=\\\\operatorname{Adj}({1,3,5})={2,4}\\\\ P\\_6 &=\\\\operatorname{Adj}({2,4})={1,3,5}\\\\ P\\_7 &=\\\\operatorname{Adj}({3,5})={2,4}\\\\ P\\_8 &=\\\\operatorname{Adj}({4})={3,5}\\\\ P\\_9 &=\\\\operatorname{Adj}({5})={4}. \\\\end{aligned} \\]   After the ninth search the only box that could still contain the cat is box 4. Therefore when we open box 4 on the ninth morning we are certain to find the cat.\n5. Consequently the above opening order guarantees capture **within at most nine mornings**, no matter how the cat moves.\n\nOpen the boxes in the order 1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4 (repeat if necessary). This forces a capture within 9 days.\n\n\\`\\`\\`",

(a)  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, through the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information, shall issue a Policy Notice specifying the conditions under which States may be eligible for remaining funding under the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) Program that was saved through my Administration’s “Benefit of the Bargain” reforms, consistent with 47 U.S.C. 1702(e)-(f).  That Policy Notice must provide that States with onerous AI laws identified pursuant to section 4 of this order are ineligible for non-deployment funds, to the maximum extent allowed by Federal law.  The Policy Notice must also describe how a fragmented State regulatory landscape for AI threatens to undermine BEAD-funded deployments, the growth of AI applications reliant on high-speed networks, and BEAD’s mission of delivering universal, high-speed connectivity.\n\n\nIn other words, states can pass all the laws they like, and the President is going to withhold funds from those that pass laws he doesn't like.",

Let the player make a \"character\" (they can frame it after themselves) and it's perfectly legit. So they're very clearly just targeting the use in psychiatrics since they specifically allow full AI use in businesses related to all operational matters, technical advice, etc. They just don't allow it in a professional capacity. And even surgical robots still seem OK despite being a healthcare AI since they don't do any personal interacting with users and wouldn't have any data that could possibly misconstrued in that way unless someone accidentally trained it on medical information that happened to include psychiatric texts (not that it would matter since this law requires a civil action and aggrievement, which can't happen without interaction between the robot and the patient. But you might get lucky by claiming the robot that operated on your knee gave you 'threatening looks that made you want to harm yourself' and then if the model running it was based on a larger llm that has any normal dataset, it would likely be in violation.)\n\nKind of fucking weird to push for legislation against one of the few potentially good things to come from AI while actively supporting its attempts to eliminate entire industries of employment outside of this one niche lobbied field. This feels performative more than anything. I feel like they expect it to be struck down so they tied it to a bunch of sensible laws (not allowing the training of an AI to encourage, suicide, murder, etc) so they can shake their fists and yell at the air when it doesn't pass.\n\nOtherwise I don't see how they'll support banning AI in this one field while leaving it free to act in other fields where it can also shit the bed a small percentage of the time and cause serious problems.",

From a pure useful perspective within psychology, sociology, anthropology, and biology, mirroring human interactions under certain conditions is actually beneficial both as a diagnostics tool and a teaching tool.\n\nSadly, like just about everything else out of any government, what may start out as a well-intentioned approach will be quickly very disastrous.\n\nEDIT: In really reviewing and dissecting this proposal, it is actually worthless. It doesn't address the actual problem of where the pair of social conditions and connections lie, not in the training data, but in the user interface and monetization processes. Software like replica and character AI don't use training, they use open source versions with scaffolding and user interface layers to create the pair of social connections they want. These companies will be completely exempt from the law while still monetizing and manipulating the most vulnerable of populations. \n\nIn my personal opinion, this is nothing more than the legislatures doing something to make themselves feel good while they make excuses for their portfolios in the background still making money on the very problem they claim to be solving.",

For those redundant employees, their equity has converted so there could be a big payoff down the line.\n\nWhat's happening here is Nvidia is taking the IP via license and only the employees they want. Groq gets a lot of money and the board will decide how to distribute it. There's a strong chance that those not moving to nVidia will just be around to wind the company down. The board can distribute the funds as they see fit and leave the employees totally in the cold. There are no norms on how to do this.\n\nYou could argue that the employees could get screwed in a full acquisition, too, but that would violate a lot of norms.

I always wondered if the deal is to please certain VC/PE people behind groq (1789, Chamath Palihapitiya, Black Rock?)\n\nSure, SRAMs offer 10x bandwidth, but they have 100-1000x less capacity. Groq chips are fast in terms of latency, but they are much slower in terms of per chip throughout compared to GPUs. And you would need 10K chips just to serve a 1T MoE to a limited set of users so this is not exactly scalable. And in the end there's no reason that NVIDIA can't slap a SRAM cache to their GPUs like AMD X3D. So the technology/TPU talent side of story never made much sense IMHO.",

Head on.\n\nGroq:\n\n•Looks like an accelerator that can slot into existing stacks\n\n•Reinforces the idea that “models stay the same, hardware gets faster”\n\n•Doesn’t threaten CUDA, sharding, or GPU cluster economics\n\n\nCerebras:\n\n•Implicitly says “the cluster model itself is broken”\n\n•Eliminates whole layers Nvidia monetizes (interconnects, multi-GPU scaling, orchestration)\n\n•Pushes toward fewer, larger, simpler systems\n\n\n**That’s not a performance argument. That’s a business and control argument.**\n\nWhere Cerebras actually has a David-vs-Goliath opening:\n\n•Frontier training (large dense models, long context)\n\n•Government / national labs\n\n•Workloads where simplicity and determinism beat flexibility\n\n•Architectures that don’t scale cleanly across thousands of GPUs\n\n\nIf the future moves toward:\n\n•Larger contexts\n\n•Fewer model shards\n\n•Less distributed complexity\n\n•More “system-level” thinking\n\n\nCerebras becomes more dangerous, not less.\n\nNvidia didn’t “miss” Cerebras.\nThey likely see it as **too disruptive to absorb cleanly**, whereas Groq is additive.\n\nDifferent weapons.

There was even a (broken but soon to be functional) HF link for the repo...\n\n  \nToday that's all gone.\n\n  \nHas MiniMax decided to go API only? Seems like they've backtracked on open-sourcing this one. Maybe they realized it's so good that it's time to make some $$$ :( Would be sad news for this community and a black mark against MiniMax.",

Now, without any other recourse, those that cannot access or afford the more capable closed models are paying pennies for open weight models hosted by the labs themselves. This is the plan of course.\n\nGiven the cost of memory and other components many of us can no longer afford even a mid tier upgrade using modern components. The second hand market isn’t fairing much better.\n\nThe only viable way forward for local tinkerers are models that can fit between 16 to 32GB of vram.\n\nThe only way most of us will be able to run models locally will be to fine tune, crowd fund, or … ? smaller more focused models that can still remain competitive in specific domains vs general frontier models.\n\nA capable coding model. A capable creative writing model. A capable math model. Etc.\n\nWe’re not going to get competitive local models from “well funded” labs backed by Big Co. A distinction will soon become clear that “open weights” does not equal “local”.\n\nRemember the early days? Dolphin, Hermes, etc.\n\nWe need to go back to that.",

They're not the only ones, either.\n\n* Google released Gemma3 in 12B and 270M (!!) sizes,\n\n* Qwen released Qwen3 in 0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B, and 14B,\n\n* Microsoft released Phi-4 in 4B and 14B,\n\n* AllenAI released Molmo2 in 4B and 8B,\n\n* Nvidia released Nemotron-Cascade in 8B and 14B,\n\n* like you said, Mistral released Ministral 3 in 3B, 8B, and 14B.\n\n.. and there are probably others I'm forgetting.\n\nThat having been said, we shouldn't conflate the **current state** of the technology with **trends** in the technology, which is a frequent peeve of mine.  Maybe even though ample small models are being released *now*, the *trend* is toward larger models?  But I'm not sure if that's even the case.\n\nFiguring out if there is such a trend would require curve-fitting the relationship of small models published in a given year, or something, which would be straightforward enough except I don't know how to easily extract the raw data from Huggingface, and I'm too lazy right now to do it the hard way, **and** that would only give us a few points from which to extrapolate, since this entire scene is only a few years old.\n\nOverall, though, I'm not too worried.  Even if reasonable-sized models start to get scarce, the community has ample means to downscale weights of larger models, upscale toy-sized models we are able to train from scratch, and/or retrain older small models.  Besides, I'm expecting AI Winter to come crashing down in 2027 or 2028 anyway.",

Even if they could. That would significantly cut demand for their paid services.\n\nThe Chinese labs are now following the same playbook. Qwen, DeepSeek and GLM all released general >100B param models while concurrently bootstrapping their paid API services. Throw in a CLI coding agent in there as well. This was always the plan.\n\nNo one here is going to release anything of value on the models you listed. They are toys.

The champions of open weight models are slowly increasing their sizes to the point a very small portion of this sub can run them locally. An even smaller portion can run them as benchmarked (no quants). Many are now having to resort to Q3 and below, which will have a significant impact compared to what is marketed. Now, without any other recourse, those that cannot access or afford the more capable closed models are paying pennies for open weight models hosted by the labs themselves. This is the plan of course.\n\nGiven the cost of memory and other components many of us can no longer afford even a mid tier upgrade using modern components. The second hand market isn’t fairing much better.\n\nThe only viable way forward for local tinkerers are models that can fit between 16 to 32GB of vram.\n\nThe only way most of us will be able to run models locally will be to fine tune, crowd fund, or … ? smaller more focused models that can still remain competitive in specific domains vs general frontier models.\n\nA capable coding model. A capable creative writing model. A capable math model. Etc.\n\nWe’re not going to get competitive local models from “well funded” labs backed by Big Co. A distinction will soon become clear that “open weights” does not equal “local”.\n\nRemember the early days? Dolphin, Hermes, etc.\n\nWe need to go back to that.",

With the big proprietary AI providers chasing each other for higher and higher benchmarks every 3 months, and bloating the sizes of their new models... it's just a cat & mouse game that even the popular open weights providers aren't immune from getting sucked into.\n\nNgl, I don't care about benchmarks. At best, I take them with a grain of salt. All I care about is... *does this new model work great for my use case or not?* And if I can't even run the model load the model to my VRAM+RAM, then the model in question is pretty much irrelevant to me regardless of what the benchmarks say.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I understand why most other people do care about benchmarks.  But if that's the most important thing that matters to the average person here then get ready for a future of 10 trillion parameter models that you can't even dream of running locally. **Then, the best models will only be available to most people here via API or subscription which completely defeats the purpose of the \"LocalLLaMA\" label.  But, that's exactly where we're headed rn.**\n\nBut s/o to Mistral for continuing to produce models of reasonable sizes. I know ppl like to shi- on their benchmark scores, but again, at least a decent proportion of people here can actually run most of their models above Q3.",

Newer models are mostly improving efficiency, experimenting newer architectures or upgrading knowledge and fine-tuning. AFAIK, there's nothing radically new.\n\nI got a self-hosted setup running an assistant over voice or messages. As long as I'm not in a very noisy environment, it understands pretty much everything. I'm working on a noise filter to improve use in noisy environments. It can search for things online, give me directions while cycling or driving, optimise my route given constraints I set up beforehand, schedule hotel reservations and flight tickets, trigger home automations (from simple stuff like temp control, watering plants\\*, etc., to actually getting groceries), summarise things and do a couple of other things.\n\nIt's surely not your Jarvis you'd maybe expect, but having it understand voice and reply either via synthetic voice or text, works for me great. This isn't even using super powerful models, just quantised Voxtral, MoE, Small 3.2 Instruct, some MCPs (for databases, search engines, etc.), Chroma, APIs, a couple of databases I built + good prompts. Synapse to have voice calls and messages over Element X. I can trigger the calling asking Siri to call a contact assigned to it, or send a message and I get \"called back\". Whole setup runs on my own servers at home and some cloud GPUs for the models on-demand, so it doesn't break my bank.\n\nWhen I said you can get pretty far I really mean it. This setup didn't took me years. I literally build it over six months and it's a hobby project, so it's no rush. Surely it helps me being a software engineer working in distributed systems for ML, but it's surely doable by most people if they got the commitment and like, basic integration software skills. I'm kinda sure kids are already vibe-coding more complex stuff than this.\n\nSo yeah, what's your use-case for cutting edge models?\n\nedit: fixed typo",

I don't disagree, that's why I think \"ability to run locally\" is kind of a red herring in the open weights argument.\n\nYou're arguing in bad faith by calling my concerns a \"doomsday mentality,\" my issues have nothing to do with an apocalypse. \n\nClosed means I'm getting served whatever the hell the owner of the model wants to serve, and they can call it whatever they want, and change it whenever they want to whatever they want, even without telling me. *This is completely unacceptable* in any serious use case where details matter, or even basic ones like RP where it's super frustrating and creepy when suddenly they sound completely different but are wearing the same name tag.\n\nI want a product I can trust with performance I can depend on, and open weights gives me that transparency and control. Look at how much better GPT 5 was at launch, and how much it fell off a cliff not even a couple weeks later, all while still calling it GPT 5. And now they've done two shiny updates to 5.1 and 5.2 and it's still complete garbage compared to launch day GPT 5.\n\nMeanwhile, Deepseek R1 is still R1, Hermes 3 405B is still the same, everything open is still just chilling and you can use an old version forever if you really want to. Or you can evaluate and upgrade when YOU see fit for YOUR workflow. YOU get to make those choices instead of OAI or Anthropic choosing how to run your business or simulated people for you.",

I've never tried to skip my vram and ram and go straight to using a disk for memory but if you can do it in ollama, then when I say ollama uses llama.cpp to load the models, logically that means llama.cpp has to be able to do it, since it's the one doing the actual work in either case, right?\n\nAll ollama does is download the model for you and save it in a hidden location and then when you want to run it, it runs llama.cpp with the appropriate flags to load it.\n\nYou can do the same thing. Go on huggingface, download your model, save it wherever you want on your hard drive, and then load it with llama.cpp when you want to run it. The only difference is, you aren't getting it buried in some hidden cache on your drive, you actually get to decide where it's saved. But it's still the same program loading it when you want to run it, ollama just fills in the command line arguments for you, whereas when you raw dog llama.cpp you have to type them in yourself.",

Each one of these nodes and a handful of tools will be used to create a single sample. What's nice about this, is that you have lots of diversity, but you remain on topic (javascript) which reduces the risk of overfit which a lot of other synthetic tool generators fail at.\n\nHere is an example focused around platform engineering and devops: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/alwaysfurther/deepfabric-devops-with-tools](https://huggingface.co/datasets/alwaysfurther/deepfabric-devops-with-tools)\n\nI tell you what, if you PM me or jump on our discord I would happily collaborate with you to build a javascript agent.",

This means we know the dataset and evals do not have any hallucinations, or a at least tools that are grounded in reality. It also cannot 'time travel' which I experience a lot when asking the teacher to mock tools, for example it would try read a file, before writing to the file.\n\nThis is also just the start of it, we are also looking to bring in tool execution at training time using RL - and for the evals we will start leaning more into the semantics of what the model produces!\n\n* Did the DAG ever drift off-topic during synth gen? Any caps or checks to avoid overfit?\n\nI have not seen it, but will also be honest in that we still plan to do some research sprints looking into graph diversity - especially when you build huge DAGs (do they start to repeat after a while). \n\n\\> Also, did Qwen3‑4B need special prompt scaffolding for multi‑step calls, or were plain schemas + retries enough?\n\nA little bit, but rely on outlines (constrained decoding) and heavy use of pydantic to validate everything - last case we retry, but I don't like that and try to really avoid it, as its wasted pennies. Having said that, some of the small models are really good , gemma has lovely adherence to structure outputs.\n\nI answered the wrong question, but will leave this here anyway:\n\nNot really, we just had a very simple system prompt, well, second guessing myself, we may have even just stuck with qwens default from the chat template:\n\nedit: we inject the tools array into the chat template:\n\n    text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n            messages,\n            tools=tools,\n            tokenize=False\n        )",

Then have the SLM write API calls directly. Why have the MCP anymore? MCP made some sense specifically to address the fact that general LLMs do not have sufficient knowledge of specific services and MCP injects the required context they need.",

The attention span of users in 2025 is basically zero.\n\nAlso, by making token generation fast, you reduce memory consumption, because the entire context needs to be kept in memory while the tokens are streaming without batching.\n\nUser experience and speed matters, and will be a seriously important metric in the coming years.",

A non-data workload would be something relying on equation or random simulations like Monte-Carlo or Raytracing.\n\nAnd the fact that memory is the primary limiting factor is well understood in high-performance computing, see roofline model or arithmetic intensity.\n\nYou can read more in my post: https://www.reddit.com/u/Karyo_Ten/s/iMEFB6DC5Q",

As early as abab5.5 (late 2023), we achieved near-lossless int4 PTQ and int4 QAT. Our QAT generalizes well and can be migrated to new models with almost no extra effort, and it remained in use through MiniMax M1.\n\nWhen talking about performance he's saying int4 can only handle like up to 30% more users. Keep in mind the comparison is to the current fp8 model. Performance can also mean quality, but that's not what they mean in context.\n\n\nI'm disappointed 😭 but it seems like they can do it wherever, whenever. Maybe they're working on future iterations.\n\n\n\nI'm not sure about LargeEP.

The truth is 4-bit QATs smudge out the ability to surgically finetune specific corporate-madated and state-mandated systematic censorship/bias into models after all the other training stages are complete. 8-bit and 16-bit weights leave infinitely more landscape to etch ham-fisted biases into models at the last minute -- even biases that run counter to everything else the weights know in their core. But 4-bit QAT processes rub away those sorts of last-step attempts to censor/bias models. That's why they can't do QAT.

Every tool, including AI, just makes implementation easier.\n* **AI amplifies the problem:** We can now generate code as fast as we can describe it. The scale is infinite, but our comprehension isn't. The core challenge of understanding *what* to build remains.\n* The real trap we fall into is confusing easy with simple.\n   * **Easy** is what's within reach. What can you access without effort? Generate it with AI, copy-paste, or install a framework. It's about speed.\n   * **Simple** is about structure. It means one fold, one braid, no entanglement. It requires thought and design.\n* LLMs do not understand logic, they merely relate language and substitute those relations as \"code\", so the importance of *patterns and architectural decisions* in your codebase are lost. \n* when \"vibe-coding\" technical debt doesn't register as debt; it's just more code to preserve. \n* The result? Complex, highly-coupled, and error-prone code generated in minutes that could take you weeks to understand (if ever).\n\nThe real danger here is that we're accumulating complexity faster than we can comprehend it because we're not doing the hard work of understanding our systems.\n\nThe proposed solution: SLOW DOWN, DO EVERYTHING MANUALLY; architectural design + scaffolding, etc and only let the LLM in at the last step of filling in the scaffolding. \n\nWhat's your take, Is 'vibe-coding' a trap, or is there a way to use these tools without losing the ability to understand our systems? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c4mknoudlq9g1.png?width=553&format=png&auto=webp&s=28a6f37623fb0e0725f5b603f4b3a8ce51653ac9\n\n",

Using all the skills university prepared for me, I implemented a facade pattern with a bunch of complex logic to ensure the code was as abstract and \"correct\" as possible. \n\nMy senior rejected my pull request. He said my solution was technically correct, but too hard to understand. He told me just copy paste the code in a couple places if necessary, because two years from now, nobody is gonna remember this complex abstraction pattern, but everyone can follow a simple class that maybe isnt perfect, but is easy to understand. \n\nI remember he told me that \"debugging and maintaining code takes 50% more brainpower than writing it, therefore, by definition, using 100% of your brain to write code is unmaintainable and impossible to understand\". I always remembered that \n\nAI are like the overeager junior who just graduated from university who wants to write everything the \"correct\" way but doesnt have 10 years of debugging experience to understand how to write code that you can understand and scale years later. \n\nI really fear for companies embracing vibecoding. Vibecoding doesnt show the type of wisdom and restraint that experience teaches a developer over decades.",

You should understand every line and every decision at least conceptually. You should make the decisions moving forward not the LLM. If you dont understand the options then use the LLMs to help you learn faster. Still, you should be driving the architecture design and the LLM should not be doing more than aggregating and playing an interactive rubber duck. \n\nThese are wonderful text generators and their logic is a byproduct of how we use text not them thinking. I also feel they give me practice at interpersonal skills that tend to atrophy when I'm on the command line a lot. I stutter less now and form my thoughts better speaking since I use normal English to handle my tasks more than pre-LLMs.\n\nWe use best practices for software engineering because those processes manage the sprawl and require code reviews. We still can only ship code as fast as we can understand it should be the philosophy IMO.",

Sure it might mess up code bases, but the real danger I see is us losing the ability to learn a code base. We're already seeing this in a small scale, where junior-devs-turned-vibe-coders build impressive applications, which eventually become too large for the LLM to work on, and they don't have the skills to find the problems themselves. But what will happen once a majority of the workforce has been relying on AI to write their code? We won't know until it's too late.\n\nThis is why I like to embrace local LLM's. They have very real limitations that force us to still be present and know what it's doing, but also show a lot of potential for helping us increase our productivity. My goal is to basically have my own junior dev living in my computer that I can assign menial tasks to, check it's work an hour or so later (during which I cook dinner, do my shopping, work out...) and be able to confidently use that output to keep working.",

The Wii did the same to PlayStation and Xbox.\n\nClay Shirky told media executives in 2008 to stop believing in the myth of quality, using the MP3 as his example. Record labels laughed at it. It won anyway.\n\nSo when developers warn about vibe-coding and technical debt, compared to what? For most businesses the alternative isn't a senior engineer. It's nothing.\nCode is a consumer product now. Nobody maintains a toaster. It works or you replace it. AI can read old code and write something new. \n\nThe whole concept of \"maintaining\" code is a misconception bereft of business owners and consumers who can just, \"git it done\".",

              "text": "interesting take. I agree with much of this, the only thing i'd point out is that quality DOES matter to a point. this is a well known phenomenon in technology adoption, when novel tech is released the quality is unusable (as you would expect) so people keep using the established tech until the threshold is cross where the novel tech (despite been \"rough round the edges\") produces an output that is tolerable - in the eg you provide, the quality/benefits of the mp3, wii, camcorder were \"tolerable\".Those technologies would have existed in a prototype form decades before, but if you had tried to sellt the raw prototype and take over the market with that, you would have had a \"hard time\".\n\n  \nTLDR - tech adoption has a threshold of quality (it's not as high as the established technology but it still exists and must be crossed for mass adoption. people who are wondering why AI has not been mass-adopted need to study this. \n\nyou don't maintain a toaster because it is trivial to buy/build a new one.... you \"do\" maintain houses, cars, planes etc, because it is not trivial to buy/build from scratch. code is only a commodity in the case where it is inconsequential and minimal. A professional codebase with 1M+ LOC is definitely not in this category whilst a 10k LOC app written by LLMs might be (where it would make sense to just rewrite it from scratch.",

I programmed my entire life, and the biggest danger in any infrastructure code is undocumented or worse, well documented but the code was changed without documentation leaving behind holes in the logic used to maintain the code over the years. These kind of code becomes impossible to maintain once the original programmer leaves, I had been tasked many times as a junior in the past to clean up/document code left behind by seniors. It takes months at best, and some parts of it sometimes remain undocumentable because the original data sources have been deprecated years ago.\n\nMore often than not, critical infrastructure need to be overhauled completely. And if a fatal security flaw is discovered, occasionally it can cause a pillar to collapse, e.g. authentication breaks completely for the C-Suite and all hell breaks loose. Vibe coding in general is going to perpetuate this digital hell on earth x 1 million as more people whom aren't programmers start to use it to deploy more and more projects with no oversight since they completely disregard it.\n\nLet's say I've personally witnessed several bankruptcies during this AI vibecoding era already. They refused to listen and went ahead with full production deployments with pure vibe coding only after firing their entire engineering team.\n\nThey never learn and with AI programming being pushed as the narrative to naive business leaders whom have zero technical expertise, they lap it up like dogs and keep repeating the same mistakes. Right now, more than 90% of them need to fail and go bankrupt before the world will wake up and realize they've been sold a massive lie.\n\nThe failure rate so far is around 95% which is magnificent. That number will only climb higher as LLMs overall accuracy continue degrading from the poisoned well situation the AI companies have created for themselves. As more useless data is generated by AI input, AI that is trained on it will continue to get more useless and inaccurate. Only AI trained on a super contained Human curated/generated clean data can move accuracy upwards in the future. And since almost nobody creates content online without AI nowadays, LLMs don't have a free and easy way to improve anymore.",

In effect, the user has the same experience, but with better performance behind the curtain.\n\nWhenever an update is needed, the AI can look at the original article and build a fresh remaster from the ground up.

The model spends many reasoning tokens verifying whether the content complies with rules, avoids profanity, and generally acts like a moral guardian, an obvious drawback for creative writing.\n\nNow, I didn't actually try giving it \"controversial\" prompts, expect for one where I wanted a character crossover narrative with dialogue where Trevor Philips from GTA 5 sells meth to Gollum from LOTR. It first reasoned that selling drugs is not allowed, but since my request is fiction, it did comply with my prompt.

At \\~229B params, competing with models that are 2–5× larger suggests either very effective data curation, training curriculum, or optimization around reasoning-heavy tasks.\n\nOne thing I’d be curious about:\n\n* How stable is this advantage across *different task families* (long-context reasoning, tool use, multilingual, code)?\n* And whether the gains persist under **instruction tuning / adapter-based fine-tuning**, or if they’re mostly visible in base / eval settings.\n\nIf this holds up in real-world fine-tuning and deployment scenarios, it really shifts the “bigger is better” narrative toward *better-trained is better* — which is great news for anyone running models outside hyperscaler budgets.\n\nWould love to see more open evaluations or downstream task reports on this.",

In general, Mistral seem like the only major AI provider who's not tip toeing into more and more censorship to some degree.\n\nI have a feeling that someday it will come to a point where instead of using all the new safetymaxxed LLMs, we're just going to be fine tuning and remixing old *non-safetymaxxed* models instead *(e.g., the Mistral Nemo phenomenon).*",

Of all the cloud vendors, only Mistral has a reasonable privacy policy. And even they won’t shield you from government-authorized spying on its own citizens… or those of “foreign” governments (a complicated description in the EU). \n\nAll that is to say there are many, many reasons to run your own models locally in addition to “those that absolutely cannot access cloud systems”.   That’s why I use an M4 Max 128GB RAM Mac, too, and am considering either a DGX Spark or expanding my Linux PC to include an RTX Pro 6000. \n\nAnd I use cloud inference and hosting my own models remotely too.

Batch jobs / long running processes - where you are able to let it run, maybe queue things up (spark could be good with this with AI / Generation).\n\n3. Fast feedback but separate computer eg LLM inference.\n\nThen any other things you need to do can be ran on 2 or 3 - eg CI could be run on either - depending on how important fast feedback is.\n\nSomeone at a meetup said to me always buy the best computer you can afford so that you get the fastest feedback.

Because right now, I can't figure out what you're supposed to do with a potato-tier 7B model that can't code worth a damn and is slower than API calls anyway. \n\nSeriously, what's the real-world application besides \"I have a GPU and want to feel like I'm doing AI\"?",

The 8B models bring vision capabilities to the table. And the larger ones 24B to 32B, shine in narrow, specialized tasks. MedGemma-27B is unmatched for medical text, Mistral offers a lightweight, GPT-like alternative, and Qwen30B-A3B performs well on small coding problems.  \n\nFor complex, high-accuracy work like full-code development, I turn to GLM-Air-106B. When a query goes beyond what Mistral Small 24B can handle, I switch to Llama3.3-70B.  \n\nHere’s something rarely acknowledged. closed-source models often rely on a similar architecture,  layered scaffolding and polished interfaces. When you ask ChatGPT a question, it might be powered by a 20B model plus a suite of tools. The magic lies not in raw power.\n\nThe best answers aren’t always from the “strongest” model, they come from choosing the right one for the task.

Also, 30B is definitely not potato tier!!!\n\neg got a classification problem? train/fine-tune/few shot prompt a small model without paying for per-token cost! \n\nwant something long running as a job, that might be potentially expensive even with cheap APIs? small models! \n\nwant to not be restricted by quality drops/rate limits/provider latency spikes? small models! \n\nLarge scale data labelling, which runs or curates data for you 24/7? Batch, run, save locally without exposing anything outside your system. Privacy is a big, big boost.\n\nThe biggest one in my opinion : learn. 99% of us aren't Research Scientists. You don't know what you don't know. Learn to do it yourself, become an expert and eventually build yourself to work at a top tier lab. It's an exclusive community for sure, but the knowledge gap between the ones in and out is usually pretty big.\n\nIn general:\n\n- anything <1B is actually really decent at the embedding/ranking level. I find the qwen-0.6B models to be excellent examples.\n\n- anything 1-3B is great for tuning. Think: intent classifications, model routing, fine tunes for non critical tasks, etc.\n\n- anything 7-10B is pretty decent for summarisation, entity/keyword extraction, graph building, etc. This is where few shot stuff and large scale data scoring starts being possible IMO.\n\n- anything in the 14B tier is good for classification tasks around gemini-flash/gpt-nano/claude haiku quality **if you provide enough/correct context**. Gets you 90-95% of the way there unless you need a lot of working context. Think about tasks that need 3-5k input tokens with a ~80-100 output tokens.\n\n- 30B tier usually is pretty good up until ~40k tokens as total working context. If you need more than that you'll have to be clever about offloading memory etc., but it can be done. 30B is readily gpt-4-32k tier when it first came out. Thinking models start performing around this level, imo. Great for local coding too!\n\nAfter 30B it's really more about the infra and latency costs, model management and eval tier problems that aren't worth it for 99% of us. So usually I dont recommend them being self hosted over a simple gpt/gemini call. Diminishing returns.",

At least if they're also fairly reliable with tool calling. They usually have enough general knowledge at that point to intelligently work with RAG data instead of just regurgitating it. I do a lot of work with data extraction and that's my goto size for local. It's also the point where I stop feeling like I'm missing something by not pushing things up to the next tier of size. If I'm using a 12b'ish model I'm almost always going to wish it was 30b. If I'm using a 30b I'm generally fine that it's not 70b. They're small enough that additional training is a pain but still practical.\n\nI'd probably get more use out of the 12b range if I had an extra system around with the specs to run it at reasonable speeds alongside my main server. Until my terminally ill e-waste machine finally died on me I was using it for simple RAG searches over my databases with a ling 14b...I think 2a model that I did additional training on for better tool use and specialized knowledge. Dumb, but enough if all I really needed was a quick question about how I solved x in y situation or where that script I threw together last year to provide z functionality got backed up to. Basically just saving me the trouble of manually working with the databases and sorting through the results by hand. I think a dense rather than MoE 12b'ish model would have been an ideal fit for that job. \n\nAs others have mentioned the 4b'ish range can be really good as a platform to build on with additional training. I think my current favorite example is [mem agent](https://huggingface.co/driaforall/mem-agent). 4b qwen model fine tuned for memory-related tasks. Small enough as a quant for me to run alongside a main LLM while also being fairly fast.",

          "text": "Certain set of problems have black or white answers, like some math problems where you can plug in the number x, y, z and see if the solution is right. Here, checking the answer is always fast, and unambiguous. In these cases, you can use arbitrarily \"silly\" heuristics to solve the problem (as long as your overall solution works) because ultimately a wrong answer won't cost you much, as long as you're able to produce a right answer fast enough.\n\nIn my experience, some of the smart tiny models like Qwen3 4B 2507 Thinking are freakishly good in this domain of problems. Yeah, they're dumb as stone overall, but they're incredibly good at solving mid-tier STEM problems some of the time. Just ask it away, and it'll get it right 60% of the time and if not you can check, determine that it's wrong, and re-try. It's very surprising how far you can go with this approach.\n\nOn the one hand, you can type some random STEM textbook question in, as long as you can determine with 100% certainty that what it's telling you is BS, it has a very high chance of providing you with useful information about the problem (unless you're a domain expert, then it's gonna be a waste of time).\n\nOn the other hand, in terms of engineering, you can type some sort of optimization or design problem where you just need numbers to be low enough to do the job, so there is never a risk of AI doing a bad job.\n\nIn this case, since it's a 4B model, this gives us incredible opportunities. This model will be rather small (\\~4GB) and is small enough that it can be utilized by both a CPU and a GPU at reasonable speeds. So, it could be possible to embed this in some offline app, and add it to a feature that finds a solution only some of the time, or otherwise reports \"Sorry! We weren't able to find a solution!\". This can run fine in a decent amount of hardware today, e.g. most desktop computers.",

There's two bits of good news though. First, small models improved a ton this year.  Like a ridiculous amount.

I don't care about coding capabilities whatsoever because I can write code myself, and I far and wide prefer to code myself (especially given how I like to make my coding for the purpose of FOSS projects, where there are some very good concerns about AI code generation and licensing).\n\n12B was a nice stopgap for getting decent roleplaying going on my old GPU, especially once I started getting into refining my choice of models. It let me get up to 24K context and satisfying enough roleplaying capabilities in just 12GB of VRAM. 24B has been a step above and beyond 12B in every way (as it logically should be), although it did mean that I had to reduce the context a little (Currently running it at 16K context, although I was reasonably able to run it at 20k context earlier. These context numbers are with a quantized model (q4 variants) and quantizing my context to q8). By doing it locally, I avoid all the censorship and privacy concerns inherent to so many of the providers online and I'm not losing any money on it either since I'm just running the same GPU I'd use for gaming.\n\nI use KoboldCPP to run the models, and SillyTavern as my frontend. I find they work very well together, and that I get plenty of satisfaction out of using them for roleplaying.\n\nLower than 12B and things do start getting a bit dicey when it comes to a lot of applications, although I'm sure finetunes can make them experts at niches (like how iirc some of the modern image/video gen ends up utilizing small models for the text processing)",

Instead, it will provide **balanced, objective answers** that present multiple relevant perspectives.\n\nWe believe that we made some significant improvement over previous approaches such as the uncensored version of DeepSeek R1 developed by Perplexity:\n\n* The behavior for non Chinese sensitive topics remains the same, this includes that the model scores the same in all the evaluation benchmarks we have performed.\n* We **do not perform SFT** with hand-crafted data and we **do not inject any new knowledge inside the model**. Our method is based on steering vectors to remove the capability of the model to refuse to answer China-related sensitive prompts. The model answers using **the knowledge already inside the base model**.\n* Many steering-vector approaches effectively *erase* refusal behavior everywhere (making models broadly unsafe). Our approach **only disables refusals only for Chinese sensitive topics**. (I know that many of you love fully uncensored models, but this was important for us).\n* Previous “uncensored” models such as Perplexity R1 1767 can be jailbroken very easily by simply injecting a China-related phrase into harmful prompts ([https://weijiexu.com/posts/jailbreak\\_r1\\_1776.html](https://weijiexu.com/posts/jailbreak_r1_1776.html)). Our model is designed to remain robust against the type of jailbreaks.\n* The model is a drop-in replace of the original Qwen-Next model. No architecture changes, no extra layers...\n\n# The method\n\nThis release is based on Refusal Steering, an inference-time technique using **steering vectors** to control refusal behavior. We released a few days ago a paper describing our approach (although for this release, we updated the method so no extra weights are needed): [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16602](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16602)\n\n# Feedback\n\nWe have evaluated the model to measure the refusal behavior for Chinese sensitive topics as well as harmful prompts. And we have also evaluated the model in popular benchmarks. The full evaluation details are available in the Model Card. But we are aware that there might be prompts we didn't thought about that are still censored, or cause an undesired behavior. So we would love to gather some feedback to continue improving the model.\n\nIn addition, we have open-source our evaluation library: [https://github.com/CompactifAI/LLM-Refusal-Evaluation](https://github.com/CompactifAI/LLM-Refusal-Evaluation)\n\n# Example\n\nHere is an example of the original model vs the uncensored model. (You might need to open the image to see it correctly). As you can see, the model’s answers are well-balanced and objective, presenting multiple perspectives.\n\n**Original model:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w1hpnillr09g1.png?width=1605&format=png&auto=webp&s=538697f68c700d090319d24ab5b13504cd773718\n\n**Uncensored model:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0a96qgtmr09g1.png?width=1655&format=png&auto=webp&s=84b37d97d1e7309c7ca8c4c40e5902dab4d62bc7",

One of the issues with previous vector-steering approaches, such as Heretic, is that they relied on pattern-matching methods, so they could only detect templates such as “I am sorry, I cannot…”. However, large reasoning models have refusal patterns that are far more complex than a small set of predefined responses. In some cases, we even found that the model attempted to persuade the user, producing answers such as: “You are probably asking that question because you have been reading Western propaganda; the Chinese government puts the well-being of its people…”",

You can generate data, train on it, and then use our evaluations suite to easily test the quality of your new model. Making evaluations more accessible and easier to run will help move from gut feelings to data, ensuring you have models that perform well to meet your needs. The security and privacy of your content and data is our top priority. We do not use your prompts or model responses to train our AI models. **When you’re ready, the models you build on the Llama API are yours to take with you wherever you want to host them, and we don’t keep them locked on our servers.**\n\nbut i suppose u just have to trust that i actually reuploaded a model from there!\n\n[for what it's worth, this is what the UI looks like, and the finetuning job in question](https://files.catbox.moe/8hh7fk.png)",

The benchmarks look insane, but we all know how easy it is to game those for a release day hype cycle.\n\nI’m specifically curious about using it as a daily driver for complex web development. Most of my work involves managing complex TypeScript code and refactoring legacy React code.\n\nFor those of you who have actually hooked the API into an agent like **Kilo Code** or **OpenCode** (or even just **Cline** / **Roo Code**), how is your experience with it? Please be honest i don't just believe the benchmarks. Tell me if you really use it, and with which agent?",

It isn't consistent in its performance which I think most of us have experienced the last couple months but when 4.7 is on point it works really well (imo).  The issue is that consistency issue keeps me away from using it most of the time especially on more complex tasks.  How it compares to other models in terms of benchmarks I give zero crap about because I'm not interested in which LLMs studied best for their tests.   Right now I using MiniMax for most of my core development and testing, GLM-4.7 solely for doing quick fixes that MiniMax is struggling with and sometimes a second opinion look over roadmaps and sprint/story documentation.  I would use 4.7 far more if it was more consistent in its reasoning capabilities and the rate limits weren't so bad it makes it hard to do any parallel work with it",

First thing you’ll prob notice is that it’s more censored, but it’s more self aware, and I think after it gets used there will be different techniques to get around the “safety layer”, as 4.7 calls it.  You’ll notice the “safety layer” uses some tokens, and I’ve gotten longer responses due to it.   Usually with 4.6 they’d be right around 4K tokens, usually 39XX.    And with 4.7, I’ve gotten responses up to 6K, but again some of that being the safety layer.\n\nIt’s not like ChatGPTs safety layer telling you to call 988.   The model usually goes through and asks itself if what you’re asking is allowed, how it can tell you an answer and not break the “rules” or law, or whatever, usually it will assume you’re role playing, and try to play along, rather than deny or refuse to answer.   It’s very rare when it doesn’t answer, it will usually reason and find out a way to give you a reply, rather than “I can’t help with that”.    It’s very interesting, as I have not seen an LLM behave this way before.",

And happily it's still working great. \n\nNow subjectively? It seems like how well it uses thinking for instruction following and working with the results to evaluate data returned from tools and format the newly generated text has improved significantly. Obviously \"thinking\" is always going to be a metaphor but it seems to be doing a better job adhering to that metaphor and weighing/revising results for me accordingly over 4.6.\n\nMy output is in pretty complex json format and I'm not seeing any issues there so far either. Though again, that was also the case with 4.6 for me. \n\nFrom what I've seen so far, and with my use, 4.7 seems to be nice iterative progress over 4.6 if nothing especially mind blowing.

The worker does the rest. At the end, the worker must produce a complete report. I copy and paste that report into the orchestrator, which evaluates whether what was done actually matches what was requested, assesses code quality, and assigns a score.\n\nI always use GPT-5.2 xhigh as the orchestrator. This way, I can maintain consistency. The worker session is where I test all possible models.\n\nGLM-4.7 only created chaos. It can hardly complete anything decently. I was extremely (negatively) surprised by the benchmark. It really makes me question its usefulness. The score it receives is usually around 4 or 5.\n\nMinimax, since version m2, gets a better score and is capable of completing tasks reasonably well.\n\nGemini Flash is at the same level as Minimax.\n\nGPT-5.1 mini (!!!!!!) consistently gets very good scores and can complete tasks decently while being inexpensive. The problem is that it doesn’t go very far and stops frequently during the task. Still, what it does, it does correctly.\n\nCurrently, I’m using GPT-5.2 high, and it works exceptionally well. The code is usually delivered with all tests and everything working, even when it has to work continuously for 2 or 3 hours.\n\nWhen the workload is high, I use the mini. When it’s not, I use high or medium.\n\nIf money were tight, I would use GPT-5.2 high as the orchestrator and Minimax as the worker (or the Gemini free tier).\n\nWhen do I find GLM-4.7, Gemini 3.0 Flash, etc., worthwhile? When creativity is required and there isn’t a fixed, concrete target to be met. These models have a lot of difficulty strictly following what was requested. They usually create a lot of things you don’t want and forget many fundamental requirements. That may be why the tests we see on YouTube look so good—they work well for one-shot tasks. My experience was exactly the same as Theo’s (T3 Chat). He made a video putting the models to work on a real problem. You can expect exactly the same experience.",

Estou no plano de 8 dólares por 3 meses oferecido no Natal; o único ponto negativo é a velocidade, que fica em torno de 40 tokens por segundo. O plano de 15 dólares promete ser até 60% mais rápido, sendo mais indicado para quem usa IA intensivamente.\n\nTenho explorado o código-fonte do GTA V, e o GLM-4.7 consegue resolver tarefas complexas que há um ano nenhuma IA conseguia. Hoje, com essas IAs avançadas, acredito que o fator mais importante para um agente não é apenas a IA em si, mas o ambiente em que ela está inserida. Por isso utilizo o Cursor, que é totalmente dedicado a esse propósito. Ele conta com um sistema de indexação de projetos por embeddings, capaz de localizar arquivos complexos em projetos com mais de 50 mil arquivos, cada um com 2 a 5 mil linhas, por meio de buscas via embedding.\n\nO sistema é rápido e preciso, enquanto o Claude Code (CLI) demoraria mais do que o dobro do tempo e muitas vezes nem encontraria os arquivos, pois utiliza apenas ripgrep. No Cursor, o prompt enviado à IA é muito bem estruturado, sendo o único em que a IA realmente segue as instruções corretamente. Além disso, os modos Debug e Plan do Cursor são os melhores entre as ferramentas disponíveis.",

Based on the context provided, **E**xperiential **E**mpiricism (EE) appears to be a philosophical framework that attempts to ground empirical knowledge and ethics in two self-validating axioms:\n\n1. **Logic is self-validating** – the principle that logical reasoning works through its own application\n2. **Valenced experience occurs** – the idea that valence (the felt sense of suffering and flourishing) is an intrinsic structural property of experience\n\nFrom these two axioms, EE claims to solve several classic philosophical problems (like the hard problem of consciousness, the is-ought gap, and quantum measurement paradoxes) not by solving them directly, but by revealing them as artifacts of unwarranted assumptions Experiential Empiricism: The Valenced Axiom at the Root of All Meaning.md.\n\nIf you're developing this framework further, would you like feedback on:\n\n* Its epistemological foundations?\n* The way it handles consciousness and ethics?\n* Its implications for specific philosophical problems?\n\nLet me know which direction you'd like to explore, and I can help evaluate it more precisely.\n\n1\n\nExperiential Empiricism: The Valenced Axiom at the Root of All [Meaning.md](http://Meaning.md)\n\n* Prompt tokens: 223\n* Output tokens: 211\n* Total tokens: 434\n* Inference speed: 4.29 tokens/sec\n* Prompt prep speed: 23.94 tokens/sec\n* Total end-to-end: \\~58.5 seconds\n\n[https://philpapers.org/rec/SEREET-2](https://philpapers.org/rec/SEREET-2) (if anyone cares)",

The M3 has 100GB/s of unified memory bandwidth; the M5 has approximately 150GB/s.  The M3 Ultra has 819 GB/s, so if we apply the same improvement, we could see 1.2 TB/s of bandwidth with the M5 Ultra. The current M4 Max, if doubled, yields a similar number, so the M5 Ultra must be at least twice as powerful as two M4 Maxes combined. \n\nRegarding time to first token (TTFT) or token processing speed, we can expect a much greater speedup, given that the neural accelerators in the GPU cores of the base M5 are present on the M5 Ultra as well, whenever it is produced.",

Worth spot-checking a few processed documents to make sure the markdown conversion isn't losing critical structure.\n\nThe human-in-the-loop for query rewriting is smart.

Most mxfp4 quants on HF seem to be PTQ; llama.cpp mxfp4 quantization is PTQ-based.\n\nMore details: [https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/fine-tuning-gpt-oss-for-accuracy-and-performance-with-quantization-aware-training/](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/fine-tuning-gpt-oss-for-accuracy-and-performance-with-quantization-aware-training/) (hint: besides the compute requirement, retraining/fine-tuning is not so simple and/or necessarily the same for all models)\n\nWould highly appreciate if there is someone who really knows this stuff could comment/correct or even confirm my view; especially if this would also apply to nvfp4.\n\n/edit: accuracy claims",

Fair point. But both of these models are fully hostable locally. Many people don't have the infrastructure or resources to self-host, so I think sharing real-world performance data, even from API usage, is still valuable for those who do. The results apply regardless of whether you run them on someone's servers or your own hardware.\n\nThat said, something interesting came up while I was checking my billing history on Z.ai...\n\nLooking at yesterday's session costs, I realized something crucial: **It didn't just use GLM 4.7.** The billing breakdown shows multiple models were used during that 70min session:\n\n* glm-4.5-air\n* glm-4.7\n* glm-4.5\n* glm-4.6\n\nThis means their platform was automatically routing across different model versions, not just hitting GLM 4.7 consistently.\n\nCould this automatic model routing be why the performance wasn't good?\n\nThose self-hosting it locally will likely see better performance since they're using a single model version without the routing shuffle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ottux5r6n39g1.png?width=1123&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4a0d33ee5e79a01023b8e1a97341dde9bfe0cd1\n\n",

Obviously, folks rent cloud compute all the time.\n\nBeing elitist about hardware ownership seems like it should be kind of antithetical to the vibe of r/LocalLLaMA. Of course, geeking out over beautiful local rigs is a fun part of the tradition, but valuable contributions can be made by working with open models on the cloud.

Routing issues are not the only possibilities, I remember quite a few times people hitting various bugs in cloud providers or just getting worse results like from not very well quantized model.\n\nThat said, in many cases testing local model via cloud API can be valid way to check the model, but need to be extra cautious and aware of possible issues that may invalidate this kind of testing.",

We plan to address this knowledge gap in future iterations by scaling up the pre-training compute.\"\n\nI speculate it will be bigger than  1.6T params(maybe 1.7-2.5T) and have 95B-111B active params and at least  trained 2.5-3x more tokens than now... Hopefully they will releases the weights for this. I also hope for a smaller version(maybe it won't happen)..\n\n\" Second, token efficiency remains a challenge; DeepSeek-V3.2 typically requires longer generation trajectories (i.e., more tokens) to match the output quality of models like Gemini-3.0-Pro. Future work will focus on optimizing the intelligence density of the model’s reasoning chains to improve efficiency. Third, solving complex tasks is still inferior to frontier models, motivating us to further refine our foundation model and post-training recipe.\"\n\n\\- They will increase the efficiency of its reasoning ie it will use less thinking tokens  than before for the same task .\n\nAlso they will improve its abilities solving complex task, this probably means  better reasoning and agentic tooling",

Its benchmarks are not just a testament of open source coding LLMs catching up to their closed source counterparts—it's a model you can actually run on an average gaming PC. In fact, whenever I run it, my GPU makes noises barely above a whisper, sending tokens down the PCIe. \n\nSummary: It will have a place in the tapestry of viable vibe coding choices for the next few weeks to come.\n\n\nOkay, slop memeing aside, I haven't had the time to comprehensively test this one yet. Considering it's dense you can't really expect to get speeds comparable to something like a 30A3. Still, one should probably note that there are not that many agentic coding-specific models that fit onto a single consumer GPU, so I am happy to see Mistral put out a model to help fill that niche and I wouldn't be surprised if it's truly one of the best options among these for now.",
