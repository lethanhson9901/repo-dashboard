Knowing that links between nodes are typed (meaning you can only link edges with compatible types).\n\nFor now I chose the approach that you need to manually put the new block in the flow to replace the old one. Upgrading or updating a block does not impact existing ones in an already created flow (for now).\n\nMaybe I have to think about a much clever and robust solution for a future version.

No market research. I just wanted to understand how it worked.\n\nI ended up building **ArtScan**, an iOS app that lets you scan a painting and get info about it.  \nIt’s basically an AI wrapper. Nothing fancy. No original model. Just camera → API → response.\n\nAt the time, I honestly thought:  *Ok, this will be a fun weekend project, I’ll learn something, and that’s it.*\n\nFast forward to today:\n\n* \\~20k downloads total\n* \\~40k product page views\n* \\~7% conversion rate\n* Around $10k revenue\n* And somehow… **30–50 downloads per day**, consistently\n\nWhat’s funny (and a bit unsettling):  \nI don’t really know *why* people keep downloading it.\n\nI’m not running ads anymore.  \nI’m not actively promoting it.  \nAnd App Store analytics shows installs coming from keywords I don’t even target. According to Astro app, it’s ranking for stuff I never planned for.\n\nThis is all a side project.  \nI have a full-time job. I build apps at night, sometimes tired, sometimes motivated, often just curious.\n\nThings I *didn’t* do:\n\n* No launch on Product Hunt\n* No viral post\n* No influencer campaign\n* No clever positioning\n\nThings I *did* do:\n\n* Built something I personally wanted to try\n* Shipped it without overthinking\n* Improved it slowly when users complained or got confused\n* Didn’t kill it when I thought \"meh, this won’t go anywhere\"\n\nI’ve had other apps fail much harder than this one.  \nSome with better ideas. Some with more effort.  \nThis one just… stuck.\n\nI’m sharing this mostly to remind myself (and maybe you) that:\n\n* You don’t always know what will work\n* Learning projects can turn into real things\n* Side projects don’t need a grand vision to be worth building\n\nIf you’re sitting on a \"this is probably useless but I’m curious\" idea… maybe build it anyway.\n\nHappy to answer questions or just read similar stories.\n\nPS: Out of curiosity, I recently vibe-coded an Android version of the app. Same idea, almost same features… totally different outcome.  \nLots of downloads, **one single purchase** so far 😂  \nSame project, same logic, very different reality. Side projects are humbling like that.\n\nPSS: If you’re curious, [click here to see the app](https://paintingrecognition.com/).\n\n  \n**PSSS**: I am a lady BTW, \"bro\" aren't the only ones who codes ;) ",

I've seen similar patterns with my own projects.\n\nCurious about the \"ranking for stuff I never planned for\" part. Did you do any ASO at all initially, or did you just write a basic description and let the App Store figure it out? Sometimes the AI/vision angle naturally captures a ton of long-tail searches that nobody is competing for.\n\nAlso, the \"didn't kill it when I thought it won't go anywhere\" is probably the most underrated advice here. So many side projects die because we move on to the next shiny thing before giving them time to breathe.",

A simple description, obvious keywords, nothing fancy. I didn’t do any deep keyword research or long-tail strategy. I think you’re right that the AI/vision angle + paintings/art kind of creates its own long tail, and the App Store slowly figures out where to place it.\n\nAnd yes… not killing projects too early is something I’m actively working on. I’ve killed way more projects than I’ve shipped. Lately I’m trying to be more disciplined and let some apps \"sit\" longer, even when they feel quiet or unexciting.\n\nThat patience part is way harder than shipping, honestly \\^\\^",

You can't imagine how many hours I've spent improving my parsers to try to avoid false positives.\nI've even noticed that the mistake often comes from the advertisers themselves, who, when filling out their ATS, check remote=true when it's not the case at all. This complicates things when retrieving data via the various APIs. I try to make everything as robust as possible. On the contrary, I'm not trying to lie or anything, since I'm not selling anything to job seekers. I've also added a way to report errors, and I've already had some feedback, which is great because it allows me to correct companies/offers.\nAs for hybrid jobs, I wanted to include them and be able to search by city. When I was looking for a remote job myself, if a hybrid job with two days a week in the office had been offered in my city, I would have accepted it. That's why there's a \"+ Hybrid\" toggle.",

      "text": "Built 4 different side projects between 2024-2025. All solved genuine problems I validated through interviews. All had paying customers willing to buy. But only 1 actually made consistent money. Took me 18 months to realize the difference wasn't product quality or problem validity. It was whether I could organically reach enough customers without paid ads. First project was CRM for real estate agents. Great product, agents loved it, charged $49/month. Problem was I couldn't reach real estate agents organically. They weren't on Reddit. No searchable keywords brought them. Needed LinkedIn ads or cold calling. Died at $340 MRR after 6 months because I couldn't afford customer acquisition.\n\nSecond project was analytics dashboard for Shopify stores. Solid tool, store owners wanted it. But Shopify app store was saturated. Getting discovered required paid ads competing against funded companies. Made $180 total before quitting. Distribution was impossible without budget.​ Third project was scheduling tool for healthcare clinics. Clinics needed it desperately. But healthcare sales cycle was 3-6 months, required demos, compliance questions, multiple stakeholders. As solo founder working nights, I couldn't handle that sales process. Gave up at 2 customers.​\n\nFourth project was content calendar for newsletter creators. Finally got distribution right. Newsletter creators gathered in 8 active subreddits, 5 Facebook groups, and searched specific keywords on Google. I could reach 10,000+ potential customers organically. Built tool in 5 weeks, launched everywhere they gathered, hit $6,400 MRR in 6 months. [Studied pattern in Founders database comparing side projects that succeeded versus failed](http://foundertoolkit.org). Successful ones had organic distribution channels accessible to solo founders. Failed ones required paid ads, long sales cycles, or access to audiences solo founders couldn't reach. Distribution feasibility mattered more than product-market fit.​\n\nThe framework I wish I knew earlier was validate distribution before building. Can you reach 5,000+ target customers through Reddit, SEO, or communities you access for free? If no, don't build it as side project. Save that idea for when you have budget or team. Submitted successful project to 95+ directories, ranked for buyer keywords within 6 weeks, engaged in communities daily. All free distribution that scaled. Previous 3 projects had no path to customers without spending money I didn't have.\n\nStop building side projects for markets you can't access organically. Start with distribution channels, then build for audiences you can reach.\n\nHow many of your side projects failed because of distribution, not product quality?",

I've seen founders build genuinely excellent B2B products that die because the sales cycle requires demos, procurement processes, and 6+ months of trust-building - impossible for solo founders with day jobs.\n\nYour framework of \"can I reach 5,000+ customers for free?\" is basically asking \"do I have a distribution unfair advantage?\" For most of us, that's Reddit, Twitter, or SEO-able keywords. If your customers aren't in those places, you're fighting uphill.\n\nOne thing I'd add: even within reachable communities, timing matters. Commenting on rising posts in niche subreddits has been way more effective for me than posting my own content. Less competition, better visibility as the post grows.\n\nWhat made you decide to keep trying after the third failure? That's a lot of pivots without giving up entirely.",

Today I have 2 apps live on the App Store, 2 apps scrapped, 2 landing pages, and another idea in the works. 52 downloads. $24 in revenue.\n\nI'm posting about it anyway because every AI thread is \"built this SaaS in 3 prompts\" and I sat reading all of it thinking maybe I'm just not cut for this.\n\nHere's the real timeline:\n\n**Days 1-3:** Copied a proven concept (photo cleaner app), used VibeCode to build it, submitted to App Store. Got rejected. Three times. Took 2 weeks to figure out the submission process. Nobody posts about that part.\n\n**Week 2:** Realized you don't use one AI tool—you use five. VibeCode, Windsurf, Claude, Nano Banana, [Aura.build](http://Aura.build), Expo. My monthly bill skyrocketed. Each tool does different things. Trying to use one for everything doesn't work.\n\n**Week 3:** Hit real bugs. State management issues. Gesture conflicts. A fullscreen viewer showing black screens. Spent hours learning why. AI can't debug what you can't explain.\n\n**Week 4:** Remotion came out. Everyone posting \"did this in 5 prompts.\" I spent 3.5 days struggling to understand motion effects and video composition. Still don't understand half of it.\n\nThen marketing. Posted on Reddit. r/iosapps went well. r/digitalminimalism? Permabanned. r/AppHookup? Removed. r/iphone? Blocked.\n\n**The numbers:**\n\n* 2 apps live, 2 scrapped\n* 52 downloads, $24 revenue\n* 1 permaban\n* 3 App Store rejections\n* 0 lines of code I could write from scratch\n\n**What I learned:**\n\nVibe coding is real but limited. The moment something breaks, you need to understand it. Marketing is harder than building—maybe 70% of the work. And $24 is not failure. 52 strangers downloaded something I made.\n\nI'm not quitting my job. I'm not posting \"quit your 9-5\" content. Just going to keep building and see if I can get to $100, then $1,000.\n\nIf you're thinking about starting: don't wait until you know enough. Ship something ugly. Get rejected. Make $24. It's a real start.",

I basically press every button, fun content, references to memes, storytelling with journey, advices to people (I am not remotely close to what I want to be but could help beginners by being real with them), aesthetics, etc. mostly short form content, until i get visibility and some kind of an audience. Right now i am just storing videos to share in a week or two to have a window to create more. This is just the beginning, though.\n\nI honestly was scared to even record. I am normally confident, been involved in many projects in Europe so I am kinda experienced with content as I was sharing stuff in my account to show friends funny words that mean different things in my language for example. I have been on live tv as well but i could not start content. wanted to do it for years but something was holding me back. i had to say \\`f- it we ball\\` to start at some point. I was scared of being cringe, not getting views, etc. but you know, the more you f- around, the more you find out. nobody knew what they were doing at the beginning. even me with my own app, i did not know. i still don't know how did i ship it. f- around and find out method made me do it. so i decided to apply the same to content stuff. Reddit is not really a place for distribution, nobody cares and everyone markets their stuff. people got fed of it. X  is overpopulated with build in public. i post once or twice a day because to get views or monetization there you either need to be very lucky or you need to have premium and as an unemployed cs drop out unfortunately it ain't possible. i just try to be me everywhere so that i wont sound like \\`just another one.\\` so i decided to switch my focus to video content as blowing up with even one video can drive thousands of people to my app. \n\nmost important thing i realized was marketing was more important than actual app. and i should not identify myself with my products because if i am interesting enough the product will get the engagement eventually. without me the app would not be there.\n\nanyway, i assume i yapped too much but if there is anything useful for you there, i'm glad to be helpful. \n\nand most importantly, thank you for asking.",

Might have happened for 10< ppl. Or more. Can’t prove exact statistics. But as a person who worked on 200+ SEO projects i can say: everything that looks too easy or too cheap is actually 10 times more expensive and 100 times harder than on those bs hooks which only goal is to drive engagement in socuals. I will never forget a post on fb, of a person creating children songs on youtube, for youtube kids. He had some 5min video explaining the process. Looked super simple. You generate images, animate them with hailuo, create the song with suno, edit with capcut, that all absolutely free and done in 20min, than those videos get viral on YT kids and you start earning day 3(thats what the person on the video explained). During this time when i watched this, i was actually on a holiday with friends(nerds, playing games in a distinct area in the mountain). So we collectively decided to try. Started the process. We created our first polished song after roughly 7 hours of collective efforts. It was a complete mess but looked similar to the one on the video. We created YT channel.(Would not even mention that due to limitations it costed us roughly 120$ for all the tools simply coz if we did not paid that, it would take is 170 hours only using free versions). So far, so good. The channel was live, the song uploaded, everything set as explained on the video. 24h later. Total 17 views. Most likely 16 of them were from the people who participated. Since im quite a dedicated person when i decide to create something(project, side hustle etc) during the course of the next 60 days(i managed to polish the process to roughly an hour a day for a song), posting 1 song a day, the final result was: 17 subscribers, net 600 views on YT.\nlesson learned the hard way.",

This whole AI trend brings me back to that era on which I was too late! But now is a different story, the building aspect was reduced to a matter of days, and if I manage to get the marketing part right, you’ll have a real business in front of you of you. \n\nNot hoping to make millions but to increase my living standard yes, if I can keep being consistent",

      "text": "So last year I spent 12 months on a budgeting app. Clean UI, solid features, I was pretty proud of it honestly.\n\nTotal users: 1. Yep.\n\n15 years as a developer. I can build stuff. Marketing though? No clue.\n\nLooking back it's obvious why it failed. Crowded market, nothing special about it, and I just built what I wanted. Not what anyone asked for. B2C with no audience is rough.\n\nAnyway. I took a break and thought about what I actually know that people would pay for.\n\nAnd it was right there. I've been building mobile apps for years. Every single project I end up rebuilding the same crap: auth, push notifications, payments, CI/CD. Takes weeks before you even start on actual features.\n\nSo I just packaged all that into a [starter kit](https://www.kmpship.app/) for other devs.\n\nLaunched mid-June last year. Got customers in the first week. Hit $1k in 3 months. Now almost at $3k. Still early but that's more than the budgeting app made in a year lol.\n\nIt's a mobile app starter kit for Kotlin Multiplatform. One guy said it saved him 50+ hours. Another made back 4x the cost within weeks of shipping his app. (Way more satisfying than a budgeting app nobody used 😅)\n\nOne more thing. Kotlin Multiplatform is becoming a serious option next to React Native and Flutter. But almost no one is building tooling for it yet. So I figured why not be early. Worst case I learned a lot. Best case I'm one of the few options when KMP blows up.\n\nAnyway, curious what you guys think. Open to feedback or if anyone's worked with KMP I'd love to hear how it went.",

      "text": "Most of us here are builders. We spend weeks in that 'vibe-code' flow state, polishing the UI and shipping features, but then we launch to absolute silence. I fell into that exact trap with my latest project. I thought if the code was clean and the problem was real, the traffic would just show up.\n\nSpoiler: It didn't. I was stuck in the loop of 'Launch Day' dopamine hits followed by 0-user weeks. I realized that as a solo builder, my side projects were essentially invisible because I was ignoring the boring foundation of authority.\n\nI realized that as a solopreneur, I needed a channel that compounds so I don't have to be \"on\" 24/7. That meant SEO, but I didn't have the budget for an agency or 25 hours a week to become a guru.\n\nPhase 1: The Authority Foundation - I slowed down writing blog posts and started building domain authority. Without it, you’re invisible. I researched myself and spent about 5 days doing a \"slow-drip\" of directory submissions, about 10 a day to keep it looking organic for Google’s crawlers. I wanted to build \"trust signals\" before I started pushing content.\n\nPhase 2: The \"Patience\" Gap - The first few weeks were dead quiet. This is where most solo founders quit. But if you look at the crawl data (not able to attach image in this community), Google was actually starting to visit the site more often because of those directory backlinks.\n\nPhase 3: The Payoff Around month two, the \"authority floor\" was high enough that my pages actually started ranking. I’m now seeing 1.76k+ impressions weekly and hitting 500+ organic users signups. The best part? This traffic converts way better than my cold outreach did because these people are actually searching for a solution.\n\nThe Takeaway: If you’re a solopreneur burning out on the social media treadmill, try spending one week on your SEO foundation. It’s boring, manual work at first, but it’s the only marketing that gets easier the longer you do it.\n\nI honestly think the reason most people skip this is that it’s just incredibly boring manual work. It took me 25+ hours of data entry to get those first 50 submissions done right. Since I’ve already got my researched list and the workflow open for my own projects, I’m happy to help a few other founders out if you'd rather stay in the 'vibe-code' flow state than fill out forms.",

Batch similar fields (taglines, short/long desc, use cases) so you’re copy-pasting, not rewriting your life 50 times. I’d also write 2–3 angle variants (use case, feature-first, outcome-first) and rotate them so you can see which actually drives signups instead of just clicks.\n\nIf you ever want to scale beyond directories, layering in stuff like Ahrefs for topic discovery, F5Bot for simple keyword alerts, and then something like Pulse for Reddit to catch high-intent threads where people ask for tools in your niche keeps the “manual” part focused where it actually moves numbers.\n\nMain point: boring, repeatable authority systems beat launch-day spikes every time.",

Not flashy, not novel, but actually useful, and its doing way better than I expected. Vibe coding or not, getting something out that people can use changes how you think about building.\n\nAlso the list aspect is underrated. Even if only a small group finds it valuable, that is still real traction. Id say keep going, worst case you learned a ton and best case it turns into something way bigger than you expect.",
