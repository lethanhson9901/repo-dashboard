He didn’t divulge actual operating costs but I’m certain it was quite a bit and I’m pretty sure the only revenue was ad sales for the podcast.",

          "text": "Cool experiment. I have been building with AI agents for a while and the biggest lesson I learned is that the visual layer (desks, speech bubbles, green/yellow status) is fun but the hard part is always the same: how do you know agent output is actually correct?\n\n  \nWith 8 agents talking to each other you get compounding hallucination risk. Agent A summarizes something slightly wrong, Agent B builds on that summary, Agent C acts on it. By the time it reaches you, the error is buried three layers deep and looks totally plausible.\n\n  \nThe things that actually worked for me:\n\n  \n1. Keep agent chains short. Two agents max in a chain before a human checkpoint. The longer the chain the more garbage accumulates.\n\n  \n2. Make every agent write to a log you can audit, not just show a speech bubble. If you cant trace back why an agent did something, you cant trust it.\n\n  \n3. Token costs scale way faster than you expect with multi-agent setups. Each agent-to-agent conversation is burning context windows on both sides. I would track your daily spend closely for the first month.\n\n  \n4. The WhatsApp interface is smart though. Natural language commands with zero prompt engineering friction is underrated. Most agent frameworks make you write YAML configs or chain builders when honestly just texting instructions works better.\n\n  \nThe real question from the comments (what concrete output did they ship) is the right one to focus on. The architecture is cool but at the end of the day it comes down to: did the newsletter actually go out, was the research accurate, did the tweets perform. Would love to see a followup post with actual metrics after a month of running this.",

And the millionaire part… well, you see it haha. But honestly, I'm blown away by the reception and really happy people found it funny.\n\nI changed my mind quite a while ago about how I approach projects, and now I'm always trying to do stuff like this.

This quickly escalated into a much larger project than expected, from a time, effort, and cost perspective :). I also managed to archive a lot of the House Oversight committee's documents, including from the epstein estate.\n\nI scraped everything, ran it through OpenAI's batch API, and built a full-text search with network graphs leveraging PostgreSQL full text search.\n\nNow at 1,317,893 documents indexed with 238,163 people identified (lots of dupes, working on deduping these now). I'm also currently importing non PDF data (like videos etc). \n\nFeedback is welcome, this is my first large dataset project with AI.  I've written tons of automation scripts in python, and built out the website for searching, added some caching to speed things up.\n\n[**https://epsteingraph.com**](https://epsteingraph.com)",

For people names specifically, combining trigram similarity with Levenshtein distance works surprisingly well — something like \\`SELECT \\* FROM people WHERE similarity(name, 'target') > 0.6\\` catches most common variations (middle names, initials, typos in OCR output). Way cheaper than running another round of LLM calls for entity resolution.\n\nAlso curious about your scraping setup — 1.3M docs is a lot of I/O. Did you parallelize the downloads or run them sequentially? And what was the split between OCR-able scanned PDFs vs docs that already had a text layer? That ratio can massively affect both accuracy and cost.\n\nImpressive project for a first large dataset + AI build ngl.",

I am happy with it as it is, but if possible to get updates - I immediately noticed a few things:\n\n\\- I understand that the design concept for it is to be monochrome, but at least a few optional colors for cards would help to group tasks\n\n\\- a shortcut to delete the current card would be really useful (CMD+Backspace, maybe?)\n\n\\- a shortcut to \"finish writing\" in the current card and release the focus (or you can call it \"Submit\") (CMD + Enter?)\n\n\\- a shortcut to list all shortcuts (Shift + ?)\n\n\\- some sort of scrolling the canvas would be useful. When I use it full screen, and then resize - I can't scroll to cards that get cut off / hidden. Basically, forcing me to use it the same size all the time.\n\nНу красунчик просто!

      "text": "**What it does**\n\nYou type in an idea, a product, or just an industry name. The engine searches the internet for articles, reports, and filings that point to real financial losses. Regulatory fines, court settlements, workforce data. Then it structures everything into a report: who's losing money, how much, and what a fix could look like.\n\nThink of it as automated market research. Same thing a consulting firm would do for $50K. Except it takes 3 minutes and costs me about $0.50 per scan in API calls.\n\n**The numbers**\n\n* 40,000+ documented business problems\n* 300+ industries\n* 8 countries\n* 6 months of building\n* \\~$5,000 in API costs (Perplexity for research, Claude for analysis)\n\n**Tech stack**\n\n* Python backend (FastAPI)\n* Next.js frontend\n* Perplexity API for sourcing\n* Claude API for structuring and analysis\n* Supabase (Postgres)\n* Hosted on a single DigitalOcean droplet\n\n**Here are 10 ideas the engine found. Every dollar figure traces back to a public source.**\n\n**1. HVAC Compliance Tracking**\n\nEPA Section 608 requires HVAC companies to document refrigerant leak inspections. Most still use paper logs. When auditors show up, incomplete records mean fines of $15,000-$50,000 per violation per year.\n\nHVAC companies are 5-15 person shops. The owner is on a roof, not evaluating software. But one failed audit wipes out a month of profit.\n\n**The fix:** Simple mobile app for technicians to log inspections on-site. Auto-generates compliance reports. $99/month per company.\n\n**2. Restaurant Menu Pricing**\n\nRestaurants lose 5-10% of food sales revenue because they price dishes by gut feel instead of tracking actual ingredient costs, portion drift, and waste. Many menu items are priced below break-even and the owner has no idea.\n\nRestaurant owners are chefs, not accountants. Existing POS systems track sales but not true plate-level costs with real-time ingredient pricing.\n\n**The fix:** Menu pricing optimizer that connects to supplier invoices and calculates real margin per dish. Flags items losing money. $149/month.\n\n**3. Physician Prior Authorization**\n\nDoctors spend 13-15 hours per week. Not per month. **Per week.** On prior authorizations. The average practice submits 39-41 per week. The AMA puts the industry-wide waste at $437 million annually on this one bottleneck.\n\nI had to re-read this three times. Cross-checked the AMA numbers against a MGMA report. Same ballpark. This is real money being burned because insurance companies profit from the friction. They have zero incentive to fix it.\n\n**The fix:** AI that pre-fills auth forms, predicts denial likelihood, and auto-appeals. $200-500/month per physician.\n\n**4. Car Dealership F&I Compliance**\n\nThe FTC has been hitting dealerships for Finance & Insurance disclosure violations. Hidden fees, junk add-ons, misleading payment presentations. Average settlement: $2.6 million per case. The CARS Rule (effective 2025) made this even more dangerous.\n\nDealership software is dominated by CDK and Reynolds & Reynolds. Neither has built proactive compliance checking into F&I workflows. Dealers are flying blind.\n\n**The fix:** Compliance checker that reviews deal jackets before signing. Flags disclosure gaps. $500-1,000/month per rooftop.\n\n**5. Trucking HOS Fine Prevention**\n\nThe trucking industry pays $30.7 million per year in Hours of Service and ELD violations. Individual fines: $300 to $16,000 per violation. Small carriers get hit hardest because they can't afford compliance officers.\n\nHere's the thing. ELD mandates solved the recording problem but not the planning problem. Drivers still get jammed because dispatchers assigned loads without checking available hours.\n\n**The fix:** Smart dispatch layer that checks HOS availability before assigning loads. Alerts before violations happen, not after. $50/truck/month.\n\n**6. Childcare Provider Financial Planning**\n\nFederal childcare stabilization grants expired September 2023. Providers lost $50,000-$300,000 in annual funding overnight. With 5-10% margins, thousands are closing or cutting staff.\n\nThis one hit different. The grants didn't slowly wind down. They just stopped. Providers went from \"we're fine\" to \"we might close\" in one quarter. The ones surviving are doing it on spreadsheets and prayer.\n\n**The fix:** Financial planning SaaS for childcare centers. Revenue forecasting, enrollment optimization, grant tracking. $79-199/month.\n\n**7. Optometry Frame Inventory**\n\nEye care practices lose $2,000-$10,000 per month from frame stockouts. Customer comes in, wants a specific frame, it's not in stock, they walk. Most practices track inventory manually or with generic retail software.\n\nBig inventory players (Lightspeed, Square) don't handle optical-specific needs. PD measurements tied to frame selection, insurance-covered vs. retail frames, try-on tracking. Classic vertical SaaS gap.\n\n**The fix:** Optical-specific inventory management. Demand prediction, auto-reorder, vendor integration. $199/month per location.\n\n**8. Grocery Store Labor Scheduling**\n\nGrocery stores waste up to 12% of total labor costs from scheduling mismatches. Overstaffed when it's slow, understaffed at peaks. For a store doing $15M/year with 10% labor costs, that's $180,000 wasted annually.\n\nGeneral scheduling tools (Deputy, When I Work) don't account for grocery-specific patterns. Delivery truck schedules, promotional events, weather impacts, department-level staffing.\n\n**The fix:** AI scheduling built for grocery. Integrates with POS traffic data and delivery schedules. $299-499/month per store.\n\n**9. Behavioral Health Recruiting**\n\n122 million Americans live in designated Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas. Therapy practices lose $50,000-$200,000 per year in unrealized revenue because they can't hire qualified counselors. The demand exists. The supply doesn't.\n\nGeneric job boards don't work here. Behavioral health hiring needs license verification, specialty matching (CBT, DBT, EMDR), insurance panel status, supervision requirements for pre-licensed therapists. Indeed doesn't handle any of that.\n\n**The fix:** Recruiting platform for behavioral health. License-aware matching, credential verification, panel tracking. Placement fees or subscription.\n\n**10. EMS Controlled Substance Tracking**\n\nAmbulance services manage controlled substance inventories (narcotics, sedatives) that expire and need DEA-compliant chain-of-custody documentation. Manual tracking leads to expired drugs on rigs, compliance violations, and waste.\n\nPaper logs. For DEA-tracked narcotics. In 2025. I thought I was misreading the source.\n\n**The fix:** Digital chain-of-custody tracking for EMS. Scan-based logging, expiration alerts, automatic DEA reporting. $199/month per agency.\n\n**The honest part**\n\nIs every number here 100% bulletproof? No. AI can hallucinate. A source can be outdated. I beat myself up over this for months. Didn't want to show it to anyone.\n\nThen I thought about it differently. How would a human do this research? They'd go online, read articles, cross-reference data, pull out numbers. Exact same process. Just a thousand times slower and more expensive. The tradeoff is you need to verify what matters before betting money on it. Which you should do with a $50K consulting report too.\n\n**Where I'm stuck**\n\nThe engine works. The data is there. But I have no idea who my customer is or what the product should be. A searchable database? Per-industry reports? An API? A done-for-you analysis?\n\nRight now the site has a free scanner. You type your idea, it runs the full pipeline, and gives you a teaser. Full reports are paid but I'm still figuring out pricing and packaging.\n\nIf anyone's been through this \"I built a thing but don't know who it's for\" phase, I'd love advice.\n\n**Site:** [unfairgaps.com](https://unfairgaps.com/)",

          "text": "The \"I built it but who's it for\" phase is one of the hardest parts. A few thoughts from seeing others go through this:\n\n  \nYour biggest risk right now is trying to be everything to everyone. The engine covers 305 industries, which sounds impressive, but it makes it harder for any one person to feel like it's built for them.\n\n  \nPick ONE vertical and go deep. The physician prior auth idea alone is a $200-500/mo per doctor product. That's your signal. Instead of selling access to 4,410 problems, sell ONE curated report to ONE type of buyer.\n\n  \nThree customer segments that would pay for this:\n\n  \n1. Solo founders looking for validated ideas. They don't want a database, they want someone to say \"build this, here's proof it'll work.\" Package it as a $49 one-time \"find my startup idea\" product. The free scanner already does this, just make the output more actionable.\n\n  \n2. VC analysts doing market research. They spend weeks validating pain points before writing checks. If you can show them verified loss data in a specific sector, that's worth real money. Reach out to 10 early stage funds and offer a free sample report.\n\n  \n3. Existing SaaS founders pivoting or expanding. Someone already selling to HVAC companies might want to know about the EPA compliance gap. That's cross-sell intelligence.\n\n  \nOn pricing: $39 one-time for a database is leaving money on the table. The real value here isn't the data, it's the ongoing discovery. New fines and settlements happen every week. A subscription makes more sense, but position it as \"we find the opportunities, you build the solutions\" rather than \"here's a database.\"\n\n  \nThe fact that you're honest about AI hallucination risk is actually a feature, not a bug. Lean into that. \"We find the signals, you verify before betting money\" is a more trustworthy pitch than \"guaranteed opportunities.\"\n\n  \nStart talking to 20 people in one of those segments. Not pitching, just asking what they'd want from a tool like this. The answer will tell you exactly what to build next.",

But you're right, 40,000 problems mean nothing to an individual buyer.\n\n\n\nWorking with venture analysts is interesting. I'm currently going through acceleration, and one of the consultants promised to connect me with a representative of a venture firm. I also think my work would be useful to them.\n\n\n\nI'll start with the solo founder segment, since I can test it there the fastest. The scanner already exists; we just need to come to a conclusion more like \"this is what needs to be built and why,\" rather than \"here's a data wall.\"\n\n\n\nIn fact, I can easily get overwhelmed; there are too many possible developments. So I grit my teeth and do it.",

Most of the ingredients go into multiple dishes and small businesses are bad at estimating, or even taking their time inputting everything. For example they need potatoes in half of their dishes, they estimate how much potatoes each dish need. At the end of the day, they served X plates, but used 50% more potatoes. They got clueless and just stop using software. Also quality of ingredient matters, so sometimes you have small potatoes where you basically cut half of them away, sometimes you have good large ones.  \n  \nIf you really want to have per-dish cost you need person who wants to do this, spend their time investigating why today they used more potatoes than yesterday. Re-calculating frequently. Changing how much each dish needs based on previous results and uncertainties. Most small owners don’t want to do this. And those that do, can do it in excel. Larger kitchens that serve a lot of food cheaply have dedicated staff for it.  \n  \nno 8 is bullshit, that’s why nobody is trying to solve it. You *don’t* want more staff when there are more customers, because when you have a lot of customers, you don’t want to restock shelves, as that makes your store even more cramped and your customers have worse shopping experience, as they can’t go through aisles easily and pick up items they want. So in peak hours, you need more cashiers and in slower hours you restock shelves. Slowest day is sanitary day, when you scrub everything religiously. Since same people can do all three, you just shift them where they are needed the most. Cleaning shelves in peak times is NOT a good idea.  \n  \nBut good exercise on your part. If you truly want to do any of these, find someone who actually does this and talk to them, what they would pay for and try to describe to them, what they would actually need to do even if you wrote perfect software",

Slowest day is sanitary day, when you scrub everything religiously.\" I understand that, and I appreciate your comment as you are an insider. But I do have a question tho, sorry if it sounds dumb (i've never worked in retail slash retail adjacent stuff) but how would you know when is a peak hour and when is a slow hour, doesn't it always change thruout the year? Like I get it weekends will obviously be more rush than weekdays, but like you never know when 10 new customers start showing up on a random wednesday everytime from next week right? Also, aren't the restockers different from the cleaners and that different from the cashiers? Like I would assume all of these people are doin different works and sticking their designated job right, not sharing responsibilities or am I just dumb? Also, lastly, couldn't we just straight up go Elon (on Twitter) on these by just replacing 80% of the workforce with robotics (by let's say mid 2030s)?",

                  "text": "\nnot bad questions at all!  \n1. same people do everything. That’s why retail job is so hard, because you have multiple responsibilities. Larger stores usually have part time workers that only do single task (cashiers, people to restock items), but these only handle “baseload” demand, any peaks and lows are handled by full time employees  \n2. peaks are usually well defined. Hours when people are going home from work. Weekends (Fridays and Saturdays). Holidays. You know them and expect them. Of course there are some slight variation, like you said 10 people decide to go shopping to your store, but thanks to law of large numbers, it evens out over few days. “Law of large numbers” is that if you throw a dice one time, you can have any result from 1 to 6 with same chance. But if you throw dice hundred of times, it’s very unlikely you will throw sum close to 100 or 600, it will most likely be somewhere near the middle. Same with shoppings. Some may decide to come today, some new customers may decide to go to competitor, but since you have thousands of customers it evens out to some average. Sure, some days are slightly stronger than others for no reason, but you just push some work day or two, because you won’t have 10 or 20 unexpected strong days in a row. There will be slow days and you’ll catch up, re stock shelves and do all the maintenance needed.  \n3. retail work is very flexible. For example letting your shelves be completely empty and then restock it is much more efficient, but also may result in customers leaving compared to restocking frequently. What that means is that if you have several strong days in a row and you are unable to do everything you should (for example you didn’t restock shelves for two days), it is then less work to catch up, but if it took too long you might lose some customers. But generally if you should check vegetables every two hours and you check it every 2,5 hours, nothing bad happens. If you should have sanitary day once per week and you do it on 8. day, store won’t rot. If you restock your shelves slightly less frequently, change is barely noticeable for customers. That means, when you have more customers than you expected, you just do work less often and usually it makes no difference until it is really bad. But in normal operations, you just catch up later and catching up is easy, you won’t have twice as much work if you don’t do everything you should one day",

But when you're actually doing it in your mid-40s, that voice in your head says otherwise.\n\nI'm in my mid-40s, starting this ambitious project with great expectations but even greater fear of failure.\n\nAround 40 days ago I committed to building and launching 6 products in 12 months. The first one goes live in about 2 weeks.\n\nEverywhere I look, it's 20-something founders shipping their second or third company. Moving fast, pivoting overnight, building audiences of 50K like it's nothing.\n\nAnd here I am, just getting started.\n\nBut I've been around the block. Built other businesses, made money, lost money, learned a few things about what people actually want vs what I think they want. That instinct matters more than I realized.\n\nThe young founders have energy and speed on their side. No question.\n\nI have something else. I can smell when an idea is already validated vs when I'm building in the dark. I know that trying to compete head-to-head in a crowded space is suicide - you need to carve out your corner first.\n\nThese aren't things you learn from a course. You learn them by screwing up enough times.\n\nStill, some days I wonder if I should've done this 20 years ago. Other days I think starting now is exactly right.\n\nI'm documenting the whole thing on X, Threads and here on Reddit as I go. Not because I have it figured out, but because maybe there are others out there doing the same thing and we can learn from each other.\n\nIf you're in your 40s (or beyond) building something, I'd genuinely love to hear how it's going for you. What does it feel like on your end?\n\n42 days in. First launch soon. Let's see what happens. ",

Most successful startups are founded by middle-aged entrepreneurs. \n\nDespite the popular belief that youth drives innovation, data shows **age is a significant advantage** in entrepreneurship, particularly for building high-impact, scalable ventures. ",

I can smell bullshit product ideas a mile away now - stuff I would've wasted 6 months on in my 20s, I skip in 5 minutes because I've watched enough companies burn money on \"solutions\" nobody asked for. The age thing is weird though. On one hand, I have the patience and discipline to actually finish something (younger me would've quit after Day 3). On the other hand, watching 23-year-olds with 50K followers making $10K/month while I'm at Day 11 with 0 sales is... humbling haha ;) But here's what I notice: the young founders pivot fast because they can afford to fail 10 times. We can't. So we ship slower but more deliberately. That's not a weakness, it's just a different game. Also - you're doing 6 products in 12 months? That's ambitious as hell. Are you validating each one before building or just shipping fast and seeing what sticks? 42 days in is nothing. You're just getting started. Let us know when Product #1 launches! Congrats on taking this leap btw! 💪👏",

First of all, you 0 sales is more than normal thing, it is the \"Slowly, then suddenly\" type of thing, once you fine tune your GTM strategy and reach the right audience, then the \"suddenly part\" kicks in.\n\nYou are right, 6 products in 12 months it is absolutely scary, but the idea is exactly the one you've mentioned \"shipping fast and seeing what sticks\", we can definitely not market 6 products at the same time alone (my co-founder and me), so, we will simply dismissed what doesn't work and move forward. At the same time, some of those products are \"boring products\" (not novel ideas, things that already work, are already proven, and have already audience paying for these type of products), so, we are mixing \"novel ideas\" perhaps nobody wants (big risk) that we would need to validate before hand, with proven ideas we know that are already validated.\n\nWhat is your product about by the way?

That's exactly what I keep telling myself at Day 20 now (still 0 sales, still learning). You're right though - I can feel the GTM strategy getting sharper every day. It's like... I know what I'm building is solid, I just haven't cracked who needs to hear about it yet. Your 6-product strategy makes way more sense now. Mixing \"boring proven ideas\" with \"novel risky bets\" is smart as hell. You're hedging without being paralyzed. I respect that. Younger me would've gone all-in on the riskiest idea and burned out by Month 3 haha.\n\nMy product is Memflect - turns your memories into 5-minute audio reflections in your voice (AI-cloned) with music you choose. It's for people who need to process difficult memories but journaling never worked for them. Type your memory → speak a mantra → get back a cinematic audio track of yourself coaching you through it. $3.99 one-time, no subscription. The validation process has been wild. Built it because I needed it (classic founder mistake? haha). Now I'm learning that the people who get it immediately are coaches, therapists, and people in recovery - not the \"wellness TikTok\" crowd I initially targeted. Live and learn!\n\nCurious which of your 6 you're shipping first? And are you doing them sequentially or building multiple in parallel?\n\nGood luck with the launch sprint. 42 days in, you're just warming up.

I too started late in the game as well, at 45 making my first app. I would caution on trying to launch 6 products in 12 months and instead focus on getting the first one out.   \n\n\nIf you are able to smell out a good idea, then the other big advice I wish someone had shared with me sooner is this, make sure you market and build your brand and network. You will need that for future iterations. Bringing multiple apps in a year just complicate that as your message and vision will be misunderstood by the average person that, if they even do see your idea which is challenging without ads, marketing, SEO, word of mouth, etc, will still wonder if App X from you is different from App Y and how did you make that many and support them. If you focus on one App then they will think of you and then in the future if it had their needs met, will have slightly more trust that you made something for them in the first place. It also allows you to message them in the future with the next launch and get more buzz going.\n\nGood Luck!",

Those 20-something founders are moving fast, sure, but they're also making a lot of rookie mistakes at scale. You already know how to validate ideas, manage resources, and read market signals. That's not something you can learn from a course or a Twitter thread.\n\nThe biggest mistake I see is people trying to compete on energy and speed when experience and judgment are actually more valuable. You're building 6 products in 12 months - that's ambitious, but I'd encourage you to think about quality of validation over quantity of launches. One product with real traction beats six experiments that never find product-market fit.\n\nAlso, documenting in public is smart. The meta-narrative of 'founder in their 40s building' is itself differentiated positioning. People want to follow journeys, not just products.\n\nLooking forward to seeing what you ship. The fact that you're questioning yourself is probably a good sign - it means you're thinking critically rather than just building in a bubble.",

The bit I haven't solved is timed orchestration - periodic prompts to the llm to trigger an agent process. If this was n8n I'd have scheduling - but I want something far more flexible than a set flow. I think I need something like this to sit over the top and make decisions based on the data it's getting.

              "text": "This actually makes a lot of sense and it's closer to what PocketPaw already does than you might think.\n\nThe pieces you're describing, we have most of them:\n\n\\- Self-hosted LLM: Ollama is supported but need more testing. Auto-detects your local instance, no API keys needed. We have plans to make Ollama and local model support first class.\n\n\\- MCP support: PocketPaw connects to MCP servers (stdio + HTTP). So your custom MCPs that process and serve data, those would plug straight in.\n\n\\- Scheduling: Built-in cron scheduler with natural language parsing. \"Every 6 hours, check the latest data and decide if anything needs action\" is a valid prompt. It's not a rigid n8n-style flow, it's literally just prompting the agent on a schedule and letting it decide what to do.\n\n\\- Mission Control(Deep Work): This is probably the piece you're actually looking for. It doesn't just run a fixed pipeline. It takes a goal, breaks it into tasks, runs agents, and makes decisions based on what comes back. So if your MCP returns anomalous data, the agent can decide to investigate further, trigger another process, or flag you.\n\nThe \"autonomous agent that makes decisions based on the data it's getting\" is exactly the use case Mission Control was built for. The difference from n8n is that there's no flow to draw. You describe what you want and the agent figures out the steps.\n\nThat said, I want to be honest, we're still early. This is beta, things will break, APIs might change between versions. The core loop works and people are using it daily, but if you're building something production-critical I'd say kick the tires first and give feedback on what's rough. Early adopter input is what shapes where this goes.\n\nWould be curious what kind of data your MCPs are processing. If you want to try wiring it up I'm happy to help you get the MCP config right.",

Limited context window.   \nIf you have a large meeting, like 1h or something, the transcript is relatively big and can't fit in the single request. You are limited to 4k of tokens roughly. Which is not enough. I could split this into chunks with overlapping parts, but still, the summary of the meeting would be far from ideal.  \nRegarding speech recognition.  I tried various models, even bundled Whisper into the app initially.  \nWith Whisper, you need a large model to do proper STT, and it's slow.  \nApple's native STT API is exptremelly good imo. It's fast and predictable.\n\nOne limitation I discovered is that you can't transcribe two separate audio streams at the same time. You def need to mix audio buffers into a single stream. And it also has a 1m length limit for the buffer.",

The one you personally use the most. Ignore the other two completely for now. Then give yourself one single evening to just slap in the simplest possible paywall. It does not have to be perfect. RevenueCat or even just a basic StoreKit setup with one tier. Ship it with the ugliest paywall you can live with. You can always polish it later but you cannot iterate on something that is not in the store.\n\n  \nThe \"no budget for ads\" thing is actually fine. Most indie apps get their first 50-100 users from a single Reddit or HN launch post and word of mouth from friends already on TestFlight. You already have friends using it daily so you are ahead of most people at this stage.\n\n  \nAlso congrats on the new kid. Sleep deprivation makes everything feel 10x harder than it actually is. The fact that you built three apps with a 5 month old is already impressive. Just ship one.",

          "text": "Man, I feel this deeply. I had almost the exact same situation — app working great on my own devices, a couple friends using it, and then just... paralysis when it came to actually shipping.\n\nWhat finally got me moving was reframing the problem. I was treating \"launch\" as this big event that needed to be perfect — polished paywall, App Store screenshots, a landing page, maybe a Product Hunt launch. But in reality, nobody cares about your v1.0 launch. Nobody is watching. And that's actually liberating.\n\nHere's what I'd suggest for the new-dad-zero-energy situation:\n\n1. \\*\\*Ship one app this weekend with the simplest possible paywall.\\*\\* RevenueCat + a single \"Pro\" tier. Don't overthink pricing. $2.99/month or $19.99/year. You can always change it later. The goal is just to remove the mental block of \"it's not ready.\"\n\n2. \\*\\*Skip marketing entirely for now.\\*\\* Just get it on the App Store. Real users trickle in from App Store search alone — slowly, but it happens. You'll get organic feedback without lifting a finger on social media.\n\n3. \\*\\*The LLM cost concern is real but solvable.\\*\\* Set a daily/monthly usage cap for free users. Even something like 10 queries/day is generous enough for casuals and keeps your costs predictable.\n\nThe other two apps? Don't even think about them right now. Shipping one will give you the momentum to ship the rest. The \"last 10%\" gets easier every time you do it because you realize the stakes are way lower than your anxiety tells you.\n\nCongrats on the baby btw — the fact that you built 3 working apps with a 5-month-old is already impressive. Most people can't even ship one with unlimited free time.",

It went viral (100K visitors first week) and eventually grew to **$6,500/month**.\n\nOne problem: **people kept cloning it.** Every week I'd see knockoffs pop up. Same layout, same concept, different name.\n\nAt first it annoyed me. Then I had a realization: **code is not the moat anymore.** With AI tools, anyone can clone a website in days. Fighting copycats was pointless.\n\nSo I flipped the script: instead of protecting my code, I started selling it.\n\nI packaged my codebase into [Dirstarter](https://dirstarter.com), a Next.js boilerplate for building directory websites. Took about a week – 2 days to clean up the code, 5 days for landing page and docs.\n\n**The crazy part:** I got my first sales on day one without posting anywhere. Just added a small link on OpenAlternative and sales started flowing. People had been asking about my tech stack for months – there was already pent-up demand.\n\n**Current numbers:**\n\n* \\~$5,000/month revenue\n* \\~200 customers\n* Pricing: $159 / $199 (started at $97, raised it twice)\n* Still solo, no employees\n\n**What's working for marketing:**\n\n* 30% affiliate commissions (best ROI channel)\n* OpenAlternative as a \"living demo\" of what the boilerplate can do\n* Building in public on Twitter\n\n**Main lesson:** Your existing projects can become new products. I didn't plan to sell a boilerplate – it emerged from something I was already running. Look at what you've built. Is anyone asking how you did it? That might be your next product.\n\nHappy to answer questions about the journey, pricing decisions, or anything else!",

A directory boilerplate that saves someone weeks of work and comes with a proven architecture is easily worth $200+.\n\n  \nAlso love that your best marketing channel is the product itself. OpenAlternative as a living demo is way more convincing than any landing page could be. People can see exactly what they are buying before they pay. That removes almost all purchase friction.\n\n  \nThe broader takeaway for anyone reading: pay attention to the questions people keep asking you. \"What tech stack is this?\" and \"How did you build this?\" are literally people telling you what they want to buy.

Gotta be efficient with space while keeping quality and original resolution. A 340mb ProRes 422 becomes a 3Mb file. \nOf course your final output is some kind of MP4 so it will be relatively slim. Anyways, I will process it via FFmpeg myself to save even more space.\n\nA couple of things. I noticed on an intel mac I had - i recorded the screen via the competing app and click+drag to mark files in the app - had a super long delay, the highlighting rectangle animated in 1sec delay from the mouse. Not sure if that's a petformance thing with intel but note that when you continue developing..as I have a feeling all these mouse cursor smoothing etc may create some delays / sync problems.

People will literally give you a 1 star review just to protest the pricing model even if they never tried the app. Switched to a one-time purchase and the tone of feedback completely changed overnight.\n\n  \nYour point about privacy-first being a tradeoff is the most underrated insight here. I went the same route (no analytics, no accounts) and it does feel like flying blind. What helped me was adding an optional in-app feedback button that sends a plain text email. No tracking, no accounts, but you get qualitative signal from the people who care enough to write. Even 5 of those a week gives you more useful direction than aggregate analytics dashboards.\n\n  \nOn the B2C marketing side, the community approach is the way. I found that commenting genuinely in niche subs where my users actually hang out (not spamming launch posts) drove more installs than any ad spend. The trick is that it takes months to compound and most people quit after week 2.\n\n  \n$1.5k in 3 months on a nights-and-weekends project is legit. The people who call that small usually have never shipped anything themselves.",

And it was always expensive as hell.\nAbout half a year ago I quit my job. While job hunting, started building an Al tool with a few friends. The idea was pretty straightforward. Let ecommerce operators generate their own product images and videos instead of paying insane creative costs. We named it [Pixelripple](https://www .pixelripple.ai/) and the goal was simple. Let visuals do the selling.\n\nFast forward to now. The site is fully live. We are doing over 4k USD in MRR and it is still growing. But at the same time, a buyer came in with a pretty decent offer and wanted to acquire the whole thing. Now my partners and I are stuck debating whether to keep running it ourselves or just sell and move on.\n\nIf we keep operating it, we will need to put in more operating capital and honestly there is a lot of uncertainty. I am kinda worried the pressure will get heavy real quick. On the other hand, we also keep thinking maybe the product is actually worth way more than the offer. But we are not even sure about that either.\n\nThis is my first startup ever, so I am genuinely asking. Should I cash out and go find a full time job, or keep pushing and see where this goes?",

At $4k MRR you're still in the early growth phase - if it's trending up, the valuation in 6-12 months could be significantly higher. Buyers know this too, which is why they're offering now.\n\nA few things to consider:\n\n1. What's the multiple? SaaS businesses typically sell at 3-5x ARR (sometimes higher with good growth). At $4k MRR ($48k ARR), anything under $150k would be selling yourself short if the trajectory is solid.\n\n2. Can you keep your day job while running it? If the tool is mostly self-serve, you might not need to go all-in. Keep the revenue flowing while reducing personal risk.\n\n3. Talk to other founders. Seriously - communities like r/selflaunch or even just posting updates here can help you think through these decisions with people who've been in your exact shoes.\n\nThe fact that someone wants to buy it is validation.

      "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI built a podcast app last year and had no clue how to market it. No budget. No audience. I tried posting on TikTok a couple of times and got like 200 views. Honestly, I almost gave up on the platform.\n\nThen I found a workflow that actually worked. In one week, I hit 4.4 million views. No paid ads. No lucky viral moment. Just a boring, repeatable process built around TikTok slideshows. You don't even need to show your face.\n\nHere's what I did, step by step :\n\n\\# Step 1: Research Your Niche\n\nTikTok isn't one big audience. It's thousands of tiny subcultures. I spent time figuring out exactly where my target users hang out. Not broad topics. Hyper-specific communities that actually care about what I'm building. The more specific you get, the better your content will land.\n\n\\# Step 2: Warm Up Your Account (Don't Skip This)\n\nThis is the most important part. Before you post anything, spend 3 to 5 days just being a normal user. Every day, for about 10 to 15 minutes, search for keywords in your niche. Filter by newest posts. Like stuff. Follow people. Leave comments.\n\nYou're training your For You Page so TikTok knows what niche you belong to. If you skip this step, your first posts will go nowhere.\n\n\\# Step 3: Post Once a Day, One Format Per Account\n\nAfter the warm-up, I posted one slideshow every day. One big rule here: stick to one content format per account. If you want to test videos and slideshows, make separate accounts. TikTok rewards consistency.\n\n\\# Step 4: The Slideshow Formula\n\nThis is where things get interesting. Here's what I learned after dozens of posts.\n\n\\*\\*Your hook matters more than anything else.\\*\\* The first slide has one job: make people stop scrolling. Write it in first person so it feels like a personal story. Make it curious, a little controversial, or call out something your audience relates to. If they don't stop, nothing else matters.\n\n\\*\\*Keep your visuals consistent.\\*\\* Every post should look like it belongs on the same account. I used dark, moody images because they make text easy to read. I pulled images from Pinterest but always edited them before uploading. Pinterest images have invisible tags that TikTok can flag, which kills your reach.\n\n\\*\\*A few production tips that really matter:\\*\\*\n\n\\* Use TikTok's built-in font and add your text inside the app. Don't use Canva or other design tools for this.\n\n\\* Post directly through the app. Don't use scheduling tools. They seem to hurt how far your posts go.\n\n\\* Images with people on the first slide tend to do better.\n\n\\*\\*Reply to every comment.\\*\\* When you reply, TikTok sends the person a notification. That brings them back to your post, which boosts engagement and tells the algorithm to push it further.\n\n\\*\\*Just keep posting.\\*\\* My first 5 to 10 posts flopped. That's totally normal. Keep going. When something finally hits, make variations of that post and double down.\n\n\\# What Happened\n\nAfter one week of doing this every day: 4.4 million views, a growing follower base, and +2000 signups. All without spending a dollar.\n\nLook, this isn't some sexy growth hack. It's manual work. It takes patience, especially when your early posts flop. But it's free and it works.\n\nHappy to answer any questions. Drop them below and I'll try to get to all of them.\n\n!\\[img\\](98orwcamwyig1 \"Analytics from my TikTok account\")",

TikTok (and honestly most social platforms) profile you based on your early behavior to figure out which audience to push your content to. If you skip that step, the algorithm has no idea who you are and your posts just get scattered to random people.\n\n  \nThe reply-to-every-comment strategy is also way more powerful than people realize. I noticed the same thing when I started being intentional about responding to every single person on my posts. Each reply is basically you re-requesting attention from that user, plus the algorithm sees the engagement spike and thinks the content is worth pushing further. Double benefit.\n\n  \nOne question though, did you notice a difference in performance between slideshows with more personal/storytelling hooks vs ones that were more listicle or tip-based? Curious if the format that got the most views also drove the most actual signups or if there was a disconnect there.",

When you're running agent teams, the interleaved output in the terminal becomes genuinely unreadable past 3-4 concurrent agents.\n\n  \nGoing to check out the repo.

Cloudron, Ploi, and a bunch of Laravel hosting companies proved this works really well.\n\n  \nFew thoughts from someone who's self-hosted a bunch of stuff on Hetzner:\n\n  \nThe 3.8x markup over raw Hetzner pricing is actually very reasonable when you factor in the time cost. I've spent entire weekends debugging config issues on self-hosted projects. If I billed that time at even a modest hourly rate, the managed pricing is a bargain.\n\n  \nOne thing I'd suggest thinking about: backup and migration tooling. The #1 fear people have with managed hosting is lock-in. If you can make it dead simple to export everything and spin up your own instance if they ever need to leave, that actually makes people MORE likely to stay (because they don't feel trapped).\n\n  \nAlso curious about your update pipeline. Are you doing blue-green deploys or just updating in place? Because OpenClaw has been moving fast and breaking changes aren't exactly confidence inspiring if you're running it for business use on WhatsApp/Slack.",

So you can leave easily, but also bring an existing OpenClaw setup in without starting from scratch. The goal is exactly what you said: make leaving easy so people don't feel trapped.\n\n**Updates:** In-place, not blue-green. Blue-green would mean running two instances per customer which kills the economics at these price points. What I do instead is test updates on my own instances first, wait a few days for obvious breakage, then roll out to customers. Not bulletproof, but OpenClaw's been pretty stable lately. If something does break, I'm usually fixing it before most people notice.\n\nFor business-critical stuff on WhatsApp/Slack, customers will soon be able to disable auto-updates directly in their instance.

My Reddit karma scanner job silently failed for 3 days because I fat-fingered a config update. No errors, just... silence. Took me forever to realize it wasn't Reddit's API being flaky.\n\nQuick question: Does your managed hosting include monitoring/alerting for when jobs stop firing? That's the gap I keep running into with self-hosted -- I only know something broke when I manually check or someone (well, me) notices missing outputs.\n\nAlso curious about the upgrade path -- if someone starts on €19 tier and their cron jobs start hitting rate limits, is migration to higher tier seamless or does it require reconfiguration?\n\nThe Telegram/WhatsApp/Discord integrations out of the box is smart positioning.
