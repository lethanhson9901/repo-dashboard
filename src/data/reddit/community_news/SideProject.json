I cant really see the situation where things are both bad enough where i need this yet good enough where i can still charge it.\n\nWouldn't this make more sens as like an auto response bot that can be reached via a satphone.. like a garmin inreach?",

              "text": "Hi there! Thank you!!\n\nYeah, beyond the AI providing sources for its answers, we have confidence scores and have proactively ensured anything to do with mushrooms is low confidence. It should also tell you to just avoid mushrooms too.\n\nThere are some solutions to the temperature, position, and altitude i'm excited about so I'll wait to implement them and  share. The guidance takes a proactive approach because you're right, they may think they intuitively know their survival priorities when they actually don't\n\nFor me personally, and from what I've heard it's that the device (3lbs, less than a foot wide), is rugged (you can run it over with a car and it's fine), waterproof (more so than a phone), and comes with upgraded capabilities for all features. The battery lasts a few hours so the thought would be in this version that it's for any situation where you need a few hours of guidance (lost in the wild, natural disasters, etc). I think it's a cool thing to have\n\nSo from my research \\~90% of people who get lost in the wild have their phone and have satellite yet many people still die. Satellite takes a few minutes sending/receiving, only supports a few words of text per message, isn't reliable, and is power hungry.   \n  \nImagine getting guidance from a bot where it takes a few mins to send your message, few mins to receive a reply, only to get a few words at a time. Let's hope it's not cloudy, there isn't tree coverage, you're not stuck in cave, etc (you need clear line of sight). \n\nNow contrast that with having almost instant answers with pictures, confidence scores, an AI that provides sources for its answers to a library of study guides stored on-device, maps, etc. Our battery life again lasts a few hours and will only get better too\n\nGood points though! Thanks for the feedback",

But with the app covering the weekend adventure side of things. And the Device not really being suitable for an actual emergency survival situation.. this is a cool thing to have, im just unsure if its really practical or more just a gimmick for the prepper bros (no offence).",

      "text": "**TL;DR: You don't need a technical co-founder anymore. You need to start.**\n\nFor years, I told myself I couldn't start a company because I wasn't a \"builder.\"\n\nI had ideas. I had domain expertise. But I couldn't code. And every startup playbook said: \"Find a technical co-founder or give up.\"\n\nSo I did what desperate wannabe founders do: I joined an accelerator program, surrounded myself with \"founder energy,\" and spent a year watching technical founders build while I... networked?\n\nOne year later, I felt like shit. I was 35. Still no company. Still waiting for permission.\n\n**Then something clicked.**\n\nI realized the game had changed. In 2025, you don't need to write code to build a company. You need to validate demand and execute fast.\n\nSo I gave myself 90 days to prove I could build a real B2B business without writing a single line of code.\n\n**The Stack That Replaced a Technical Co-Founder**\n\nHere's what I actually used:\n\n**1. Cursor (for building)**\n\n* I'm not a developer, but Cursor + Claude let me ship a functional MVP in 3 weeks\n*  Just me and AI pair programming.\n* Finish my platform in 3 months.\n\n**2. Loom (for recording)**\n\n* Forget fancy demos. I recorded 2-minute Loom videos showing the problem + solution\n* Sent 47 personalized videos in week 1. Got 8 calls booked.\n\n**3. Starnus (for selling)**\n\n* Needed a way to find and reach potential customers without spending all day on LinkedIn\n* Set up my ICP criteria, it finds matching leads and automates the outreach part\n* Went from 15 hours/week manual prospecting to maybe 2 hours checking responses\n\n**4. Notion (for everything else)**\n\n* Roadmap, customer feedback, sales pipeline, content calendar\n* One workspace. No complexity.\n\n**The Results (90 Days)**\n\n* **Week 1-2:** Validated idea with 23 customer conversations (all inbound from targeted outreach)\n* **Week 3-4:** Built MVP with Cursor\n* **Week 5-8:** Sent 200+ personalized outreach messages via Starnus\n* **Week 9-12:** 37 demo calls, 4 paying customers, $1,847 MRR\n\nI'm not rich. I'm not \"successful\" yet. But I have a real business with real customers paying real money.\n\n**The Uncomfortable Truth**\n\nMost founders fail because they build in isolation for months, then hope customers show up.\n\nI did the opposite:\n\n1. Found people with the problem\n2. Validated they'd pay (conversations)\n3. Built the solution \n4. Sold it \n\nRevenue came before product. Customers came before code.\n\n**What This Makes Me Think**\n\nThe \"non-technical founder\" excuse is dead.\n\nYou don't need to learn to code. You don't need a CTO. You need:\n\n* A real problem people will pay to solve\n* AI tools to build and automate the boring stuff\n* The courage to start before you're ready\n\nI wasted a year waiting for permission. Don't make the same mistake.\n\n  \nIf you're a non-technical founder sitting on an idea, stop waiting. Start validating.\n\nThe hardest part isn't building. It's starting.",

I definitely went the other way - built the whole thing, THEN went looking for customers. Classic mistake. Now I'm scrambling to figure out where my actual audience hangs out (turns out it's not the indie hacker community lol).\n\nQuestion: did you use Starnus for B2C outreach or purely B2B?

The Cursor + Claude combo really has become the default for non-technical builders at this point.\n\n  \nSomething that helped me get more done with similar constraints: async workflows. When Im running Claude Code for longer tasks (refactoring, debugging complex issues), I dont sit and watch it. I kick off the task, step away, then check back later. \n\n  \nYou mentioned the permission mindset being the biggest blocker. Totally agree. The mental shift from waiting to have everything figured out to learning by doing changed everything for me too.\n\n  \nOne practical tip for anyone earlier in this journey: if you want to keep iterating even when youre away from your laptop, there are mobile tools that let you SSH into your dev environment. I use one called Moshi for checking on Claude Code sessions from my phone. Useful when youre testing something and want to monitor progress without being chained to your desk.\n\n  \nWhat were the biggest technical blockers you hit during the MVP build?

      "text": "Running a LinkedIn lead gen agency solo for 3 years, and couldn't get more than 5 clients without hiring. But margins were too tight to bring on staff. That's why I spent 12-hour days just doing repetitive connection requests and follow-ups across different accounts.\n\nHate that feeling, like I was choosing between keeping my agency (and check) small forever or sacrificing quality to grow. So I took a risk last year and went on automation for all this copying and pasting, and focused on the strategy. I didn't expect that but my response rates went up, I hired a sales person and we managed to get 20 clients. And actually they don't care that most of the initial outreach is automated, they just see qualified conversations in their inbox.\n\nSo if are in doubt just as I did, go for it and try to integrate tools or AI models and agents or whatever to make your work faster and focus on optimization and strategy as a CEO.\n\nAnyone else struggled with this mental block around automating client work? How did you get past it?\n\n",

THE LAUNCH TRIFECTA) :**\n\n1. **Timing** \\- when you launch/post matters more than what you post. Kinda.\n   * Wrong: Do exactly what everybody else is doing. Launch another website builder :D\n   * Right: Think what is at the overlap between what you like to get absurdly deep into, now can be done diffrenetly than a few years ago, people actively talk that they need it. Yup, it's hard, nobody said it wouldn't be.\n2. **Hook** \\- you have 2 seconds to stop the scroll\n   * Wrong: \"Check out my new app!\"\n   * Right: Value. Come on, help others, nobody will help you if you don't help others. Sorry folks, I'm one of the guys that think mentioning your product name is 100% ok, but just try to deliver value. Make it free for one day for you audience, make the post funny, tell something truly useful worth remembering and unique. Again, nobody said that founding projects is easy.\n3. **Landing** \\- where you send traffic\n   * Wrong: \"We revolutionize the world one step at a time\"\n   * Right: Combat your need for aesthetics (here's where I sometimes fall myself) or perfection. Just make the value is as clear as possible. Better to make it clear but small than grand but not clear. I've had websites that had spelling mistakes do well because there was a clear USP and clear job that the product does. The other way around (pretty website, \"world anew\" claim) rarely works.\n\n\\---------\n\n\n\nDrop your project below with:\n\n* Link\n* One-line description\n* Where you're planning to launch \n\n  \nI'll do quick teardowns for first 10 or so (an eventful day for me today, so be patient, I should be able to reply to everybody within usually like 1-2hrs tops). No selling, just genuinely want to help. Seeing too many great projects get buried. If you are super good, I won't be able to help, but if there's a mistake that you are missing, I may be able to spot it in 5s, so just drop a link and let's have some fun!",

Right now you have to sit at your laptop waiting. With Moshi you get a push notification when it needs you, approve from your phone, and go back to whatever you were doing.\n\n  \nKey differentiator vs other terminal apps: Uses the Mosh protocol instead of plain SSH so your session survives wifi drops, phone sleep, subway tunnels etc. Also has on-device voice-to-terminal (Whisper runs locally, no cloud) which sounds gimmicky but is actually useful when youre on the couch and your agent needs a quick yes/no.\n\n  \nBiggest concern: Niche is maybe too narrow? AI coding agents are growing fast but the intersection of \"uses coding agents\" and \"wants mobile access\" might be small right now. Curious what you think.",

For a truly \"cursor/mouse\" only experience, I would love to just be hold down a key and mouse click to bring up the clipboard menu. This would genuinely make me switch from PastePal as I always find it a bit clunky to have to use 3 key combos and then still click around to get to what I want.

If you mean the content itself, let me know and I'll look into it.\n\n2. I've been thinking about this as tags, something like \\[#work\\] item\\_title. Is that what you have in mind?\n\n3. Can you tell me more about what you mean? Like hiding the preview for items with a certain tag? Or a password-protected section?\n\n4. I'll look into it. Out of curiosity, have you tried multipaste queues? You can ⌘+click to select multiple items and then hit Enter to paste them in order. Would that cover your use case?\n\n5. Right now it opens to the right when possible, and flips to the left near the screen edge. But a custom option sounds good. adding it to the list.\n\n6. Fixed! It was broken, thanks for catching it. Will ship in the next update -> waiting on one more thing from another user before deploying.\n\n7. You can already search by #link to filter all links, and each link has an \"open in browser\" action in the preview window. What would your ideal flow look like?\n\nI'll ping you when the new version is out with the ESC fix, and keep you updated on the other points I mentioned I'd look into.\n\nThank you so much",

      "text": "30 days ago I had never written a line of code. Today I have 2 apps live on the App Store, 2 apps scrapped, 2 landing pages, and another idea in the works. 52 downloads. $24 in revenue.\n\nI'm posting about it anyway because every AI thread is \"built this SaaS in 3 prompts\" and I sat reading all of it thinking maybe I'm just not cut for this.\n\nHere's the real timeline:\n\n**Days 1-3:** Copied a proven concept (photo cleaner app), used VibeCode to build it, submitted to App Store. Got rejected. Three times. Took 2 weeks to figure out the submission process. Nobody posts about that part.\n\n**Week 2:** Realized you don't use one AI tool—you use five. VibeCode, Windsurf, Claude, Nano Banana, [Aura.build](http://Aura.build), Expo. My monthly bill skyrocketed. Each tool does different things. Trying to use one for everything doesn't work.\n\n**Week 3:** Hit real bugs. State management issues. Gesture conflicts. A fullscreen viewer showing black screens. Spent hours learning why. AI can't debug what you can't explain.\n\n**Week 4:** Remotion came out. Everyone posting \"did this in 5 prompts.\" I spent 3.5 days struggling to understand motion effects and video composition. Still don't understand half of it.\n\nThen marketing. Posted on Reddit. r/iosapps went well. r/digitalminimalism? Permabanned. r/AppHookup? Removed. r/iphone? Blocked.\n\n**The numbers:**\n\n* 2 apps live, 2 scrapped\n* 52 downloads, $24 revenue\n* 1 permaban\n* 3 App Store rejections\n* 0 lines of code I could write from scratch\n\n**What I learned:**\n\nVibe coding is real but limited. The moment something breaks, you need to understand it. Marketing is harder than building—maybe 70% of the work. And $24 is not failure. 52 strangers downloaded something I made.\n\nI'm not quitting my job. I'm not posting \"quit your 9-5\" content. Just going to keep building and see if I can get to $100, then $1,000.\n\nIf you're thinking about starting: don't wait until you know enough. Ship something ugly. Get rejected. Make $24. It's a real start.",

If it was easy, this would not be a thing. People make money off of showing it like it's easy. I launched my app last week and there are only like 5 ysers that I don't know. Rest are friends and family. And building something like this takes a mental toll as well. My own father did not believe in what I was doing and still does not. Couldn't care less, but it makes you question yourself at night sometimes. \n\n$24 is the first fruits of your efforts. Congratulations. I hope you will reach your goals with that.",

I basically press every button, fun content, references to memes, storytelling with journey, advices to people (I am not remotely close to what I want to be but could help beginners by being real with them), aesthetics, etc. mostly short form content, until i get visibility and some kind of an audience. Right now i am just storing videos to share in a week or two to have a window to create more. This is just the beginning, though.\n\nI honestly was scared to even record. I am normally confident, been involved in many projects in Europe so I am kinda experienced with content as I was sharing stuff in my account to show friends funny words that mean different things in my language for example. I have been on live tv as well but i could not start content. wanted to do it for years but something was holding me back. i had to say \\`f- it we ball\\` to start at some point. I was scared of being cringe, not getting views, etc. but you know, the more you f- around, the more you find out. nobody knew what they were doing at the beginning. even me with my own app, i did not know. i still don't know how did i ship it. f- around and find out method made me do it. so i decided to apply the same to content stuff. Reddit is not really a place for distribution, nobody cares and everyone markets their stuff. people got fed of it. X  is overpopulated with build in public. i post once or twice a day because to get views or monetization there you either need to be very lucky or you need to have premium and as an unemployed cs drop out unfortunately it ain't possible. i just try to be me everywhere so that i wont sound like \\`just another one.\\` so i decided to switch my focus to video content as blowing up with even one video can drive thousands of people to my app. \n\nmost important thing i realized was marketing was more important than actual app. and i should not identify myself with my products because if i am interesting enough the product will get the engagement eventually. without me the app would not be there.\n\nanyway, i assume i yapped too much but if there is anything useful for you there, i'm glad to be helpful. \n\nand most importantly, thank you for asking.",

Might have happened for 10< ppl. Or more. Can’t prove exact statistics. But as a person who worked on 200+ SEO projects i can say: everything that looks too easy or too cheap is actually 10 times more expensive and 100 times harder than on those bs hooks which only goal is to drive engagement in socuals. I will never forget a post on fb, of a person creating children songs on youtube, for youtube kids. He had some 5min video explaining the process. Looked super simple. You generate images, animate them with hailuo, create the song with suno, edit with capcut, that all absolutely free and done in 20min, than those videos get viral on YT kids and you start earning day 3(thats what the person on the video explained). During this time when i watched this, i was actually on a holiday with friends(nerds, playing games in a distinct area in the mountain). So we collectively decided to try. Started the process. We created our first polished song after roughly 7 hours of collective efforts. It was a complete mess but looked similar to the one on the video. We created YT channel.(Would not even mention that due to limitations it costed us roughly 120$ for all the tools simply coz if we did not paid that, it would take is 170 hours only using free versions). So far, so good. The channel was live, the song uploaded, everything set as explained on the video. 24h later. Total 17 views. Most likely 16 of them were from the people who participated. Since im quite a dedicated person when i decide to create something(project, side hustle etc) during the course of the next 60 days(i managed to polish the process to roughly an hour a day for a song), posting 1 song a day, the final result was: 17 subscribers, net 600 views on YT.\nlesson learned the hard way.",

I made [**moonvert.app**](https://moonvert.app?utm_source=reddit)\n\nHere's the problem I encountered daily and the solution I built:\n\n**Problem:** Whenever I search \"How to convert HEIC to JPG\" or \"MOV to MP4,\" the results are a minefield of shady websites that don't care about your privacy. You dodge ads, often encounter a paywall at the end, or the converter simply fails and doesn't work. (Another thing they often have is file size limits, which is detrimental for video conversion)\n\nI wanted something I could use conveniently  – on device, integrated with Finder, and private.\n\nSo I built a universal, local file converter that supports everything I need! \n\n* **Private:** Files stay on your device. It bundles FFmpeg/Pandoc inside, so it works 100% offline.\n* **Universal:**\n   * **Media:** Video (WebM, MP4, GIF) & Images (WebP, ICNS, HEIC), Audio (MP4, WAV)\n   * **Docs:** Markdown or RTF to docx\n   * **Data:** JSON to YAML\n   * **Geospatial data**: GeoJSON, Shapefile, KML\n* **Open Source:** AGPL licensed. You can build it from source or buy the signed binary (lifetime license). I think it is best to make such a tool open-source because it's the biggest trust factor\n\nIt currently works on macOS, with Windows/Linux coming soon. I’d love to hear your feedback!",

      "text": "Built 4 different side projects between 2024-2025. All solved genuine problems I validated through interviews. All had paying customers willing to buy. But only 1 actually made consistent money. Took me 18 months to realize the difference wasn't product quality or problem validity. It was whether I could organically reach enough customers without paid ads. First project was CRM for real estate agents. Great product, agents loved it, charged $49/month. Problem was I couldn't reach real estate agents organically. They weren't on Reddit. No searchable keywords brought them. Needed LinkedIn ads or cold calling. Died at $340 MRR after 6 months because I couldn't afford customer acquisition.\n\nSecond project was analytics dashboard for Shopify stores. Solid tool, store owners wanted it. But Shopify app store was saturated. Getting discovered required paid ads competing against funded companies. Made $180 total before quitting. Distribution was impossible without budget.​ Third project was scheduling tool for healthcare clinics. Clinics needed it desperately. But healthcare sales cycle was 3-6 months, required demos, compliance questions, multiple stakeholders. As solo founder working nights, I couldn't handle that sales process. Gave up at 2 customers.​\n\nFourth project was content calendar for newsletter creators. Finally got distribution right. Newsletter creators gathered in 8 active subreddits, 5 Facebook groups, and searched specific keywords on Google. I could reach 10,000+ potential customers organically. Built tool in 5 weeks, launched everywhere they gathered, hit $6,400 MRR in 6 months. [Studied pattern in Founders database comparing side projects that succeeded versus failed](http://foundertoolkit.org). Successful ones had organic distribution channels accessible to solo founders. Failed ones required paid ads, long sales cycles, or access to audiences solo founders couldn't reach. Distribution feasibility mattered more than product-market fit.​\n\nThe framework I wish I knew earlier was validate distribution before building. Can you reach 5,000+ target customers through Reddit, SEO, or communities you access for free? If no, don't build it as side project. Save that idea for when you have budget or team. Submitted successful project to 95+ directories, ranked for buyer keywords within 6 weeks, engaged in communities daily. All free distribution that scaled. Previous 3 projects had no path to customers without spending money I didn't have.\n\nStop building side projects for markets you can't access organically. Start with distribution channels, then build for audiences you can reach.\n\nHow many of your side projects failed because of distribution, not product quality?",

I built a tool that users loved but my target customers were scattered across LinkedIn, which meant paid ads or cold outreach.\n\nMeanwhile a simpler tool I built later for content creators took off because they all congregated in the same subreddits and Discords. The difference wasnt the quality of the product, it was whether I could reach them daily without spending money.\n\nNow I literally ask myself before any project: where do these people already hang out online, and can I get in front of them for free? If I cant answer that clearly, I dont build it.",

If a project doesn’t hit at least 2/3 high, I park it.\n\n\n\nThen I do a 1–2 week “distribution sprint” before building: post problem-focused questions, share a barebones Notion mock, pre-sell with a Stripe link, and see if I can get 5–10 people to pay or commit to a call. If that fails, that’s my signal, not a challenge.\n\n\n\nOn tools, I’ve used things like Sparktoro and TweetHunter to find active pockets, and Pulse for Reddit plus normal Reddit search to catch high-intent threads where my users are already ranting.\n\n\n\nMain point: treat easy, repeatable access to the same people as a non-negotiable prerequisite, not a nice bonus.",

Your experience with the real estate CRM perfectly illustrates the \"CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) vs. LTV (Lifetime Value)\" trap. If the only way to reach your audience is through high-intent paid channels or manual outreach, it’s nearly impossible to scale a $49/month product without significant funding.\n\n\n\nIt’s refreshing to see someone acknowledge that a \"great product\" isn't enough if the unit economics of discovery don't work. Now that you've identified organic reach as your primary filter, how has your vetting process changed for the ideation phase? Do you now discard ideas immediately if they don't have a clear \"watering hole\" (like a specific subreddit or niche community) where you can build presence for free?",

Hereby I want to answer to those:\n\nu/b_supersimplescrum:  \n**how do you decide which features to put behind a pay wall and which to have in the free tier?**  \nI made the the real product which adds most value to the freemium tier. In my case that's a support widget which sends messages to discord/slack/telegram so you can talk with customers from there. The other features I had (customisation options, webhooks, unlimited domains) are now part of a paid product. So in case users like and use the product a lot, they might go for the added useful features.\n\nu/Common-Programmer-27  \n**A common knowledge is: when it's free it's not valuated**  \nAgree up until a certain extent. When its free you are bound to attract more people than your ICP, because there's a lot of people out there that ONLY want something if its free. However, if you manage to still target your ideal customers, you they will still valuate it as you are adding value to their workflows.\n\nu/MousseBrief58  \n**Props for actually looking at usage and not just flexing the PH numbers though, most people stop at “we got 500 signups” and never admit it was all fluff.**  \nThanks for the props. I think not admitting the fluff is because socials tend to attract more engagement if people achieve success. Everyone is after success, so everyone thinks that seeing how people succeed might help them be successful as well, whereas the most educational lessons can be achieved by looking at what went wrong a million times.",

Was always easy to offer a trial version that timed out after 7/14/30 days and that worked so well for me. I would give 30 days full access and have a very high trial rate and a good enough conversion rate to keep me in business for many years. When the iOS App Store came out there was no real mechanism for a trial version. Maybe a separate version with less features for free. But mainly the concept was charge a lower price and just sell it. Things have come a long way since then but the market is so flooded right now it seems very hard for any solution to have a chance without a free trial or version.",

If I would stick with a time-limited trial, I think users might not see the true value due to the lack of traffic. Therefore, I decided to make it a set and forget kind of app. People install it on their app, get the messages in their inbox, and if they start getting some more traffic, and want some extra customization options, they can then decide to upgrade for those additional features.\n\n\\^ I think this approach also adds some goodwill towards the product.
