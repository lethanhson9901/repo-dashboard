I cant really see the situation where things are both bad enough where i need this yet good enough where i can still charge it.\n\nWouldn't this make more sens as like an auto response bot that can be reached via a satphone.. like a garmin inreach?",

              "text": "Hi there! Thank you!!\n\nYeah, beyond the AI providing sources for its answers, we have confidence scores and have proactively ensured anything to do with mushrooms is low confidence. It should also tell you to just avoid mushrooms too.\n\nThere are some solutions to the temperature, position, and altitude i'm excited about so I'll wait to implement them and  share. The guidance takes a proactive approach because you're right, they may think they intuitively know their survival priorities when they actually don't\n\nFor me personally, and from what I've heard it's that the device (3lbs, less than a foot wide), is rugged (you can run it over with a car and it's fine), waterproof (more so than a phone), and comes with upgraded capabilities for all features. The battery lasts a few hours so the thought would be in this version that it's for any situation where you need a few hours of guidance (lost in the wild, natural disasters, etc). I think it's a cool thing to have\n\nSo from my research \\~90% of people who get lost in the wild have their phone and have satellite yet many people still die. Satellite takes a few minutes sending/receiving, only supports a few words of text per message, isn't reliable, and is power hungry.   \n  \nImagine getting guidance from a bot where it takes a few mins to send your message, few mins to receive a reply, only to get a few words at a time. Let's hope it's not cloudy, there isn't tree coverage, you're not stuck in cave, etc (you need clear line of sight). \n\nNow contrast that with having almost instant answers with pictures, confidence scores, an AI that provides sources for its answers to a library of study guides stored on-device, maps, etc. Our battery life again lasts a few hours and will only get better too\n\nGood points though! Thanks for the feedback",

But with the app covering the weekend adventure side of things. And the Device not really being suitable for an actual emergency survival situation.. this is a cool thing to have, im just unsure if its really practical or more just a gimmick for the prepper bros (no offence).",

      "text": "**TL;DR: You don't need a technical co-founder anymore. You need to start.**\n\nFor years, I told myself I couldn't start a company because I wasn't a \"builder.\"\n\nI had ideas. I had domain expertise. But I couldn't code. And every startup playbook said: \"Find a technical co-founder or give up.\"\n\nSo I did what desperate wannabe founders do: I joined an accelerator program, surrounded myself with \"founder energy,\" and spent a year watching technical founders build while I... networked?\n\nOne year later, I felt like shit. I was 35. Still no company. Still waiting for permission.\n\n**Then something clicked.**\n\nI realized the game had changed. In 2025, you don't need to write code to build a company. You need to validate demand and execute fast.\n\nSo I gave myself 90 days to prove I could build a real B2B business without writing a single line of code.\n\n**The Stack That Replaced a Technical Co-Founder**\n\nHere's what I actually used:\n\n**1. Cursor (for building)**\n\n* I'm not a developer, but Cursor + Claude let me ship a functional MVP in 3 weeks\n*  Just me and AI pair programming.\n* Finish my platform in 3 months.\n\n**2. Loom (for recording)**\n\n* Forget fancy demos. I recorded 2-minute Loom videos showing the problem + solution\n* Sent 47 personalized videos in week 1. Got 8 calls booked.\n\n**3. Starnus (for selling)**\n\n* Needed a way to find and reach potential customers without spending all day on LinkedIn\n* Set up my ICP criteria, it finds matching leads and automates the outreach part\n* Went from 15 hours/week manual prospecting to maybe 2 hours checking responses\n\n**4. Notion (for everything else)**\n\n* Roadmap, customer feedback, sales pipeline, content calendar\n* One workspace. No complexity.\n\n**The Results (90 Days)**\n\n* **Week 1-2:** Validated idea with 23 customer conversations (all inbound from targeted outreach)\n* **Week 3-4:** Built MVP with Cursor\n* **Week 5-8:** Sent 200+ personalized outreach messages via Starnus\n* **Week 9-12:** 37 demo calls, 4 paying customers, $1,847 MRR\n\nI'm not rich. I'm not \"successful\" yet. But I have a real business with real customers paying real money.\n\n**The Uncomfortable Truth**\n\nMost founders fail because they build in isolation for months, then hope customers show up.\n\nI did the opposite:\n\n1. Found people with the problem\n2. Validated they'd pay (conversations)\n3. Built the solution \n4. Sold it \n\nRevenue came before product. Customers came before code.\n\n**What This Makes Me Think**\n\nThe \"non-technical founder\" excuse is dead.\n\nYou don't need to learn to code. You don't need a CTO. You need:\n\n* A real problem people will pay to solve\n* AI tools to build and automate the boring stuff\n* The courage to start before you're ready\n\nI wasted a year waiting for permission. Don't make the same mistake.\n\n  \nIf you're a non-technical founder sitting on an idea, stop waiting. Start validating.\n\nThe hardest part isn't building. It's starting.",

I kick off the task, step away, then check back later. \n\n  \nYou mentioned the permission mindset being the biggest blocker. Totally agree. The mental shift from waiting to have everything figured out to learning by doing changed everything for me too.\n\n  \nOne practical tip for anyone earlier in this journey: if you want to keep iterating even when youre away from your laptop, there are mobile tools that let you SSH into your dev environment. I use one called Moshi for checking on Claude Code sessions from my phone. Useful when youre testing something and want to monitor progress without being chained to your desk.\n\n  \nWhat were the biggest technical blockers you hit during the MVP build?

      "text": "Running a LinkedIn lead gen agency solo for 3 years, and couldn't get more than 5 clients without hiring. But margins were too tight to bring on staff. That's why I spent 12-hour days just doing repetitive connection requests and follow-ups across different accounts.\n\nHate that feeling, like I was choosing between keeping my agency (and check) small forever or sacrificing quality to grow. So I took a risk last year and went on automation for all this copying and pasting, and focused on the strategy. I didn't expect that but my response rates went up, I hired a sales person and we managed to get 20 clients. And actually they don't care that most of the initial outreach is automated, they just see qualified conversations in their inbox.\n\nSo if are in doubt just as I did, go for it and try to integrate tools or AI models and agents or whatever to make your work faster and focus on optimization and strategy as a CEO.\n\nAnyone else struggled with this mental block around automating client work? How did you get past it?\n\n",

THE LAUNCH TRIFECTA) :**\n\n1. **Timing** \\- when you launch/post matters more than what you post. Kinda.\n   * Wrong: Do exactly what everybody else is doing. Launch another website builder :D\n   * Right: Think what is at the overlap between what you like to get absurdly deep into, now can be done diffrenetly than a few years ago, people actively talk that they need it. Yup, it's hard, nobody said it wouldn't be.\n2. **Hook** \\- you have 2 seconds to stop the scroll\n   * Wrong: \"Check out my new app!\"\n   * Right: Value. Come on, help others, nobody will help you if you don't help others. Sorry folks, I'm one of the guys that think mentioning your product name is 100% ok, but just try to deliver value. Make it free for one day for you audience, make the post funny, tell something truly useful worth remembering and unique. Again, nobody said that founding projects is easy.\n3. **Landing** \\- where you send traffic\n   * Wrong: \"We revolutionize the world one step at a time\"\n   * Right: Combat your need for aesthetics (here's where I sometimes fall myself) or perfection. Just make the value is as clear as possible. Better to make it clear but small than grand but not clear. I've had websites that had spelling mistakes do well because there was a clear USP and clear job that the product does. The other way around (pretty website, \"world anew\" claim) rarely works.\n\n\\---------\n\n\n\nDrop your project below with:\n\n* Link\n* One-line description\n* Where you're planning to launch \n\n  \nI'll do quick teardowns for first 10 or so (an eventful day for me today, so be patient, I should be able to reply to everybody within usually like 1-2hrs tops). No selling, just genuinely want to help. Seeing too many great projects get buried. If you are super good, I won't be able to help, but if there's a mistake that you are missing, I may be able to spot it in 5s, so just drop a link and let's have some fun!",

Right now you have to sit at your laptop waiting. With Moshi you get a push notification when it needs you, approve from your phone, and go back to whatever you were doing.\n\n  \nKey differentiator vs other terminal apps: Uses the Mosh protocol instead of plain SSH so your session survives wifi drops, phone sleep, subway tunnels etc. Also has on-device voice-to-terminal (Whisper runs locally, no cloud) which sounds gimmicky but is actually useful when youre on the couch and your agent needs a quick yes/no.\n\n  \nBiggest concern: Niche is maybe too narrow? AI coding agents are growing fast but the intersection of \"uses coding agents\" and \"wants mobile access\" might be small right now. Curious what you think.",

Right now it opens to the right when possible, and flips to the left near the screen edge. But a custom option sounds good. adding it to the list.\n\n6. Fixed! It was broken, thanks for catching it. Will ship in the next update -> waiting on one more thing from another user before deploying.\n\n7. You can already search by #link to filter all links, and each link has an \"open in browser\" action in the preview window. What would your ideal flow look like?\n\nI'll ping you when the new version is out with the ESC fix, and keep you updated on the other points I mentioned I'd look into.\n\nThank you so much",

Or if I realize later It would be nice to fix it. \n\n2- if I need to use search area to filter tags, thats too much work rather than 1 click.\n\n3- I would like to put my credit card number, or a password. so maybe for that. (just a specific tab with lock)\n\n4- I will check that, but I think it would be nice to have pin on top if I am trying out bunch of colors/hex codes for example\n\n5- thank you\n\n6- thank you\n\n7- thats cool, but also I would like to see tabs :)\n\nperfect, thank you so much!",

You dodge ads, often encounter a paywall at the end, or the converter simply fails and doesn't work. (Another thing they often have is file size limits, which is detrimental for video conversion)\n\nI wanted something I could use conveniently  – on device, integrated with Finder, and private.\n\nSo I built a universal, local file converter that supports everything I need! \n\n* **Private:** Files stay on your device. It bundles FFmpeg/Pandoc inside, so it works 100% offline.\n* **Universal:**\n   * **Media:** Video (WebM, MP4, GIF) & Images (WebP, ICNS, HEIC), Audio (MP4, WAV)\n   * **Docs:** Markdown or RTF to docx\n   * **Data:** JSON to YAML\n   * **Geospatial data**: GeoJSON, Shapefile, KML\n* **Open Source:** AGPL licensed. You can build it from source or buy the signed binary (lifetime license).

      "text": "Built 4 different side projects between 2024-2025. All solved genuine problems I validated through interviews. All had paying customers willing to buy. But only 1 actually made consistent money. Took me 18 months to realize the difference wasn't product quality or problem validity. It was whether I could organically reach enough customers without paid ads. First project was CRM for real estate agents. Great product, agents loved it, charged $49/month. Problem was I couldn't reach real estate agents organically. They weren't on Reddit. No searchable keywords brought them. Needed LinkedIn ads or cold calling. Died at $340 MRR after 6 months because I couldn't afford customer acquisition.\n\nSecond project was analytics dashboard for Shopify stores. Solid tool, store owners wanted it. But Shopify app store was saturated. Getting discovered required paid ads competing against funded companies. Made $180 total before quitting. Distribution was impossible without budget.​ Third project was scheduling tool for healthcare clinics. Clinics needed it desperately. But healthcare sales cycle was 3-6 months, required demos, compliance questions, multiple stakeholders. As solo founder working nights, I couldn't handle that sales process. Gave up at 2 customers.​\n\nFourth project was content calendar for newsletter creators. Finally got distribution right. Newsletter creators gathered in 8 active subreddits, 5 Facebook groups, and searched specific keywords on Google. I could reach 10,000+ potential customers organically. Built tool in 5 weeks, launched everywhere they gathered, hit $6,400 MRR in 6 months. [Studied pattern in Founders database comparing side projects that succeeded versus failed](http://foundertoolkit.org). Successful ones had organic distribution channels accessible to solo founders. Failed ones required paid ads, long sales cycles, or access to audiences solo founders couldn't reach. Distribution feasibility mattered more than product-market fit.​\n\nThe framework I wish I knew earlier was validate distribution before building. Can you reach 5,000+ target customers through Reddit, SEO, or communities you access for free? If no, don't build it as side project. Save that idea for when you have budget or team. Submitted successful project to 95+ directories, ranked for buyer keywords within 6 weeks, engaged in communities daily. All free distribution that scaled. Previous 3 projects had no path to customers without spending money I didn't have.\n\nStop building side projects for markets you can't access organically. Start with distribution channels, then build for audiences you can reach.\n\nHow many of your side projects failed because of distribution, not product quality?",

Your experience with the real estate CRM perfectly illustrates the \"CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) vs. LTV (Lifetime Value)\" trap. If the only way to reach your audience is through high-intent paid channels or manual outreach, it’s nearly impossible to scale a $49/month product without significant funding.\n\n\n\nIt’s refreshing to see someone acknowledge that a \"great product\" isn't enough if the unit economics of discovery don't work. Now that you've identified organic reach as your primary filter, how has your vetting process changed for the ideation phase? Do you now discard ideas immediately if they don't have a clear \"watering hole\" (like a specific subreddit or niche community) where you can build presence for free?",

I never send notes to Drive; I don't see the point. I already have the Remarkable app on my various devices, so it's pointless for me.\n\nThat's my workflow. Where I lose time (and maybe information) is with the transitions between handwriting (whiteboard or Remarkable) and organizing in Workflowy.",

People will literally give you a 1 star review just to protest the pricing model even if they never tried the app. Switched to a one-time purchase and the tone of feedback completely changed overnight.\n\n  \nYour point about privacy-first being a tradeoff is the most underrated insight here. I went the same route (no analytics, no accounts) and it does feel like flying blind. What helped me was adding an optional in-app feedback button that sends a plain text email. No tracking, no accounts, but you get qualitative signal from the people who care enough to write. Even 5 of those a week gives you more useful direction than aggregate analytics dashboards.\n\n  \nOn the B2C marketing side, the community approach is the way. I found that commenting genuinely in niche subs where my users actually hang out (not spamming launch posts) drove more installs than any ad spend. The trick is that it takes months to compound and most people quit after week 2.\n\n  \n$1.5k in 3 months on a nights-and-weekends project is legit. The people who call that small usually have never shipped anything themselves.",
