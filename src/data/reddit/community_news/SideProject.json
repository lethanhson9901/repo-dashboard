But honestly, I'm blown away by the reception and really happy people found it funny.\n\nI changed my mind quite a while ago about how I approach projects, and now I'm always trying to do stuff like this.

This quickly escalated into a much larger project than expected, from a time, effort, and cost perspective :). I also managed to archive a lot of the House Oversight committee's documents, including from the epstein estate.\n\nI scraped everything, ran it through OpenAI's batch API, and built a full-text search with network graphs leveraging PostgreSQL full text search.\n\nNow at 1,317,893 documents indexed with 238,163 people identified (lots of dupes, working on deduping these now). I'm also currently importing non PDF data (like videos etc). \n\nFeedback is welcome, this is my first large dataset project with AI.  I've written tons of automation scripts in python, and built out the website for searching, added some caching to speed things up.\n\n[**https://epsteingraph.com**](https://epsteingraph.com)",

But when you're actually doing it in your mid-40s, that voice in your head says otherwise.\n\nI'm in my mid-40s, starting this ambitious project with great expectations but even greater fear of failure.\n\nAround 40 days ago I committed to building and launching 6 products in 12 months. The first one goes live in about 2 weeks.\n\nEverywhere I look, it's 20-something founders shipping their second or third company. Moving fast, pivoting overnight, building audiences of 50K like it's nothing.\n\nAnd here I am, just getting started.\n\nBut I've been around the block. Built other businesses, made money, lost money, learned a few things about what people actually want vs what I think they want. That instinct matters more than I realized.\n\nThe young founders have energy and speed on their side. No question.\n\nI have something else. I can smell when an idea is already validated vs when I'm building in the dark. I know that trying to compete head-to-head in a crowded space is suicide - you need to carve out your corner first.\n\nThese aren't things you learn from a course. You learn them by screwing up enough times.\n\nStill, some days I wonder if I should've done this 20 years ago. Other days I think starting now is exactly right.\n\nI'm documenting the whole thing on X, Threads and here on Reddit as I go. Not because I have it figured out, but because maybe there are others out there doing the same thing and we can learn from each other.\n\nIf you're in your 40s (or beyond) building something, I'd genuinely love to hear how it's going for you. What does it feel like on your end?\n\n42 days in. First launch soon. Let's see what happens. ",

Most successful startups are founded by middle-aged entrepreneurs. \n\nDespite the popular belief that youth drives innovation, data shows **age is a significant advantage** in entrepreneurship, particularly for building high-impact, scalable ventures. ",

I can smell bullshit product ideas a mile away now - stuff I would've wasted 6 months on in my 20s, I skip in 5 minutes because I've watched enough companies burn money on \"solutions\" nobody asked for. The age thing is weird though. On one hand, I have the patience and discipline to actually finish something (younger me would've quit after Day 3). On the other hand, watching 23-year-olds with 50K followers making $10K/month while I'm at Day 11 with 0 sales is... humbling haha ;) But here's what I notice: the young founders pivot fast because they can afford to fail 10 times. We can't. So we ship slower but more deliberately. That's not a weakness, it's just a different game. Also - you're doing 6 products in 12 months? That's ambitious as hell. Are you validating each one before building or just shipping fast and seeing what sticks? 42 days in is nothing. You're just getting started. Let us know when Product #1 launches! Congrats on taking this leap btw! 💪👏",

First of all, you 0 sales is more than normal thing, it is the \"Slowly, then suddenly\" type of thing, once you fine tune your GTM strategy and reach the right audience, then the \"suddenly part\" kicks in.\n\nYou are right, 6 products in 12 months it is absolutely scary, but the idea is exactly the one you've mentioned \"shipping fast and seeing what sticks\", we can definitely not market 6 products at the same time alone (my co-founder and me), so, we will simply dismissed what doesn't work and move forward. At the same time, some of those products are \"boring products\" (not novel ideas, things that already work, are already proven, and have already audience paying for these type of products), so, we are mixing \"novel ideas\" perhaps nobody wants (big risk) that we would need to validate before hand, with proven ideas we know that are already validated.\n\nWhat is your product about by the way?

Only to experience burnout and mild depression. \n\nI just hit 40 last year, and I can say that I finally dare to start something on my own. Or at least give it a go. I'm not giving up my day job, but definitely slowed down pursuing something that wasn't even my dream.\n\nAfter years of auto-reflection and finding my way in life. I've discovered I was chasing the wrong rabbit. What I truly pursued was Autonomy and Independence. \n\nEven though I spend the better part of my life as a developer, I enjoy every minute of vibing the actual product, not just code.\n\nSo yeah, I enjoy every second of building my own thing, which supports my passion. \n\nQuite honestly never really considered how old I am. Just woke up one day and it hit me that this will be the day I will start something on my own. \n\n40 or not, let's just enjoy what we're doing, so far the journey is hell of a ride, so I guess this is the only thing that matters.\n\n",

That \"mild depression\" from chasing the wrong thing is worse than the stress of buidling your own.\n\n\"40 or not, let's just enjoy what we're doing\" - exactly.

I too started late in the game as well, at 45 making my first app. I would caution on trying to launch 6 products in 12 months and instead focus on getting the first one out.   \n\n\nIf you are able to smell out a good idea, then the other big advice I wish someone had shared with me sooner is this, make sure you market and build your brand and network. You will need that for future iterations. Bringing multiple apps in a year just complicate that as your message and vision will be misunderstood by the average person that, if they even do see your idea which is challenging without ads, marketing, SEO, word of mouth, etc, will still wonder if App X from you is different from App Y and how did you make that many and support them. If you focus on one App then they will think of you and then in the future if it had their needs met, will have slightly more trust that you made something for them in the first place. It also allows you to message them in the future with the next launch and get more buzz going.\n\nGood Luck!",

I'm in my early 30s but started my AI journey later than most in the space, and I constantly battle that feeling of 'everyone else is 10 steps ahead.'\n\nBut here's what I've learned: your timing actually gives you an unfair advantage. Those 20-something founders are moving fast, sure, but they're also making a lot of rookie mistakes at scale. You already know how to validate ideas, manage resources, and read market signals. That's not something you can learn from a course or a Twitter thread.\n\nThe biggest mistake I see is people trying to compete on energy and speed when experience and judgment are actually more valuable. You're building 6 products in 12 months - that's ambitious, but I'd encourage you to think about quality of validation over quantity of launches. One product with real traction beats six experiments that never find product-market fit.\n\nAlso, documenting in public is smart. The meta-narrative of 'founder in their 40s building' is itself differentiated positioning. People want to follow journeys, not just products.\n\nLooking forward to seeing what you ship. The fact that you're questioning yourself is probably a good sign - it means you're thinking critically rather than just building in a bubble.",

Some good, some bad.   I'm glad I did it early, but I'm enjoying the third time around as well. \n\nI had my first kid two years before starting my first company, so I always had kids around.  Now I feel like I have more time as my kids are bigger, and I don't feel so guilty working late into the night or on weekends.  \n\nStill, I have lots of other conflicts in my life that get in the way of work. My parents are getting older. My wife and I have lots of things we like to do. I have more money, so we go on trips and go do things.  \n\nThere certainly isn't a bad time to start a company or an sideproject, as long as you can afford for it to fail. \"\n\nGood luck, I hope you kill it!",

Young founders often ship fast but pivot slowly because they lack the pattern recognition that comes from real world experience.\n\n  \nOne thing I noticed from going through something similar: the 6 products in 12 months approach actually works better at our age because you already know how to kill your darlings. Younger me would have spent 8 months polishing product 1 instead of learning from the market across multiple attempts.\n\n  \nThe documenting part is smart too. Even if none of the 6 products take off, the content becomes its own asset. Some of the best founder audiences were built during the struggle, not after the win.\n\n  \n42 days in with a launch around the corner is real momentum.

Which is not enough. I could split this into chunks with overlapping parts, but still, the summary of the meeting would be far from ideal.  \nRegarding speech recognition.  I tried various models, even bundled Whisper into the app initially.  \nWith Whisper, you need a large model to do proper STT, and it's slow.  \nApple's native STT API is exptremelly good imo. It's fast and predictable.\n\nOne limitation I discovered is that you can't transcribe two separate audio streams at the same time. You def need to mix audio buffers into a single stream. And it also has a 1m length limit for the buffer.",

THE LAUNCH TRIFECTA) :**\n\n1. **Timing** \\- when you launch/post matters more than what you post. Kinda.\n   * Wrong: Do exactly what everybody else is doing. Launch another website builder :D\n   * Right: Think what is at the overlap between what you like to get absurdly deep into, now can be done diffrenetly than a few years ago, people actively talk that they need it. Yup, it's hard, nobody said it wouldn't be.\n2. **Hook** \\- you have 2 seconds to stop the scroll\n   * Wrong: \"Check out my new app!\"\n   * Right: Value. Come on, help others, nobody will help you if you don't help others. Sorry folks, I'm one of the guys that think mentioning your product name is 100% ok, but just try to deliver value. Make it free for one day for you audience, make the post funny, tell something truly useful worth remembering and unique. Again, nobody said that founding projects is easy.\n3. **Landing** \\- where you send traffic\n   * Wrong: \"We revolutionize the world one step at a time\"\n   * Right: Combat your need for aesthetics (here's where I sometimes fall myself) or perfection. Just make the value is as clear as possible. Better to make it clear but small than grand but not clear. I've had websites that had spelling mistakes do well because there was a clear USP and clear job that the product does. The other way around (pretty website, \"world anew\" claim) rarely works.\n\n\\---------\n\n\n\nDrop your project below with:\n\n* Link\n* One-line description\n* Where you're planning to launch \n\n  \nI'll do quick teardowns for first 10 or so (an eventful day for me today, so be patient, I should be able to reply to everybody within usually like 1-2hrs tops). No selling, just genuinely want to help. Seeing too many great projects get buried. If you are super good, I won't be able to help, but if there's a mistake that you are missing, I may be able to spot it in 5s, so just drop a link and let's have some fun!",

Right now you have to sit at your laptop waiting. With Moshi you get a push notification when it needs you, approve from your phone, and go back to whatever you were doing.\n\n  \nKey differentiator vs other terminal apps: Uses the Mosh protocol instead of plain SSH so your session survives wifi drops, phone sleep, subway tunnels etc. Also has on-device voice-to-terminal (Whisper runs locally, no cloud) which sounds gimmicky but is actually useful when youre on the couch and your agent needs a quick yes/no.\n\n  \nBiggest concern: Niche is maybe too narrow? AI coding agents are growing fast but the intersection of \"uses coding agents\" and \"wants mobile access\" might be small right now. Curious what you think.",

People will literally give you a 1 star review just to protest the pricing model even if they never tried the app. Switched to a one-time purchase and the tone of feedback completely changed overnight.\n\n  \nYour point about privacy-first being a tradeoff is the most underrated insight here. I went the same route (no analytics, no accounts) and it does feel like flying blind. What helped me was adding an optional in-app feedback button that sends a plain text email. No tracking, no accounts, but you get qualitative signal from the people who care enough to write. Even 5 of those a week gives you more useful direction than aggregate analytics dashboards.\n\n  \nOn the B2C marketing side, the community approach is the way. I found that commenting genuinely in niche subs where my users actually hang out (not spamming launch posts) drove more installs than any ad spend. The trick is that it takes months to compound and most people quit after week 2.\n\n  \n$1.5k in 3 months on a nights-and-weekends project is legit. The people who call that small usually have never shipped anything themselves.",

You dodge ads, often encounter a paywall at the end, or the converter simply fails and doesn't work. (Another thing they often have is file size limits, which is detrimental for video conversion)\n\nI wanted something I could use conveniently  – on device, integrated with Finder, and private.\n\nSo I built a universal, local file converter that supports everything I need! \n\n* **Private:** Files stay on your device. It bundles FFmpeg/Pandoc inside, so it works 100% offline.\n* **Universal:**\n   * **Media:** Video (WebM, MP4, GIF) & Images (WebP, ICNS, HEIC), Audio (MP4, WAV)\n   * **Docs:** Markdown or RTF to docx\n   * **Data:** JSON to YAML\n   * **Geospatial data**: GeoJSON, Shapefile, KML\n* **Open Source:** AGPL licensed. You can build it from source or buy the signed binary (lifetime license).

I’ve been tinkering with voice synthesis for a while, and I finally built something good enough to share:\n\n[imiteo.com￼](https://imiteo.com/) — a voice cloning tool that can clone a voice from a short audio sample.\n\nThe workflow is simple:  \n  \n• Upload or record a voice clip (even a few seconds can work)  \n• The app transcribes it automatically  \n• Enter the text you want spoken  \n• Click generate, and get cloned audio back in seconds\n\nI’ve been genuinely surprised by how well it performs, even with short inputs. No registration, No email.\n\nIt currently supports 10 languages: English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, German, French, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian.\n\nLanguage detection is automatic, so you don’t need to manually pick the transcription language.\n\nIf you’re curious about the stack:\n\n• nextjs, react  \n• Front Cloudflare Worker  \n• GPU L4\n\nI’d really love feedback—what works, what doesn’t, and what you’d like to see next. I’m actively improving it, so any thoughts are super helpful.\n\nTry it here: [imiteo.com￼](https://imiteo.com/)\n\nWould love to hear what you think!",

If you enjoy managing your own VPS, keep doing that  \n• Not a locked-down black box. You get root access\n\nTook me a while to get the deployment pipeline right but it's finally at a point where I'm not embarrassed to share it.\n\nIf anyone's interested or has questions, happy to answer.

I'm running OpenClaw for my startup's automation (Reddit engagement, content workflows, cron jobs), and even though I'm the only user, I've still managed to break it twice in ways that required SSH debugging at weird hours.\n\nThe \"explain why your bot stopped responding at 11pm on a Saturday\" part hits home. My Reddit karma scanner job silently failed for 3 days because I fat-fingered a config update. No errors, just... silence. Took me forever to realize it wasn't Reddit's API being flaky.\n\nQuick question: Does your managed hosting include monitoring/alerting for when jobs stop firing? That's the gap I keep running into with self-hosted -- I only know something broke when I manually check or someone (well, me) notices missing outputs.\n\nAlso curious about the upgrade path -- if someone starts on €19 tier and their cron jobs start hitting rate limits, is migration to higher tier seamless or does it require reconfiguration?\n\nThe Telegram/WhatsApp/Discord integrations out of the box is smart positioning. That's the first question anyone asks when I mention OpenClaw: \"Does it work with [my chat app]?\"",

I never send notes to Drive; I don't see the point. I already have the Remarkable app on my various devices, so it's pointless for me.\n\nThat's my workflow. Where I lose time (and maybe information) is with the transitions between handwriting (whiteboard or Remarkable) and organizing in Workflowy.",

I've definitely been in that \"build first, validate later\" trap.\n\nWhat I've learned from my own failed projects is that user complaints are gold, but the real trick is distinguishing between surface-level complaints and root causes. Someone might complain about a feature being hard to use, but the real issue is they're trying to accomplish something the tool wasn't designed for.\n\nYour export-to-AI approach is clever for pattern recognition. I'd be curious how you handle the signal-to-noise ratio though. Reddit complaints can be vocal minorities, or sometimes people complaining about the same thing in different ways. Do you do any deduplication or clustering before feeding it to Claude?\n\nOne thing that's helped me is combining complaint data with \"workaround analysis\" - looking at what hacky solutions people have cobbled together. That usually reveals what they really need vs. what they say they need.\n\nGreat execution on this. The JSON export feature makes it way more useful than just a searchable database.",
