      "text": "I launched a brand-new side project this week.  \nNo users yet. No paying customers. Just an MVP, and hope.\n\nWithin hours, I received an email from a “security researcher”.\n\nFirst message:  \nThey pointed out that our domain didn’t have DMARC set to `reject` yet and that SPF was using `~all`. They included copy-pasted advice, a PHP `mail()` example, and links to MXToolbox. Then they asked about a bounty.\n\nSecond message:  \nThey claimed they found “more critical vulnerabilities” but said they wouldn’t share details until the bounty discussion was resolved.\n\nFinal message:  \nThey warned that if I didn’t respond within 24 hours, they would publicly disclose the issues on Reddit and that this could “jeopardize the survival of the project”.\n\n....\n\nIf they actually had the backend access they implied, they would already know the truth:  \nthere is nothing to expose yet.\n\nNo users. No customer data. No revenue. Just a brand-new repo and caffeine.\n\nSo, ignored the threats and decided to do exactly what they threatened, disclose it myself.\n\nPosting this as a PSA for other side-project builders:\n\n* Not every “security researcher” email is responsible disclosure\n* DMARC defaults are common on fresh launches and not a critical exploit\n* Real reports come with technical details first, not deadlines and threats\n* “Pay me or I go public” is a red flag, not leverage\n\nScreenshot of disclosure email attached for context.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/4cXyPVc](https://imgur.com/a/4cXyPVc)  \n\n\nBack to shipping 🚀",

Having them doesn't prevent anyone from spoofing an email, and that is not a vulnerability.   And you need DKIM, which is much more involved than making some text entries for your domain.  Should you have those things in place and properly configured? Absolutely, but many people who have their own infrastructure setup SPF records, and yet don't utilize any sort of rejection or filtration for emails they receive from others.   The concern that might be legitimate is that your website application/platform/whatever does have some form of exploit or bug like a sql injection or RCE or something really serious.  It's an odd mix of issues, and does appear to be an automated campaign, but if you have made any significant mistakes with your infrastructure, maybe it would be good to find yourself someone to do some scanning or do the scanning yourself.",

Don’t get me wrong, it’s a very inviting app, but it just doesn’t hold any long term value.\n\nThe only way you could make money is by ad revenue. Especially the financial industry might be interested in placing ads on your platform… but it probably won’t bring in the big bucks.\n\nIn case you want it to become something bigger, I recommend you to think about what experience can bring value to your user long-term. For example: have the current flow be the feature to set up your goals and then add a coach to help them save money, maybe help them invest wisely, etc. (Just some examples, they may not be viable as there are already dozens of these apps)\n\nMr Munny is a nice gimmick which may boost engagement, but in case the LLM behind it is not a free model, I would recommend you to remove it/replace it with a free option.\n\nYou could also use this application to learn more about the financial industry/users and use that knowledge to build something else that is monetizable or (in case you’re more of a digital professional instead of financial) you can also use this to make a bit of a name for yourself on indie platforms. Sometimes these kinds of things can boost your odds with your next project.\n\nSo, not going to make you money unless you rethink the concept, but not useless at all. You will need to think outside of the box.",

Add an additional \"retirement income\" field to capture things like pensions, annuity, etc income.\n4.

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share a small story from one of my side projects.  \nNo launch tricks, no \"10x growth\" moment, just a thing I built for fun that kind of… kept going.\n\nLast summer (2024), I decided to play with the OpenAI API for the first time.  \nNo big plan. No market research. I just wanted to understand how it worked.\n\nI ended up building **ArtScan**, an iOS app that lets you scan a painting and get info about it.  \nIt’s basically an AI wrapper. Nothing fancy. No original model. Just camera → API → response.\n\nAt the time, I honestly thought:  *Ok, this will be a fun weekend project, I’ll learn something, and that’s it.*\n\nFast forward to today:\n\n* \\~20k downloads total\n* \\~40k product page views\n* \\~7% conversion rate\n* Around $10k revenue\n* And somehow… **30–50 downloads per day**, consistently\n\nWhat’s funny (and a bit unsettling):  \nI don’t really know *why* people keep downloading it.\n\nI’m not running ads anymore.  \nI’m not actively promoting it.  \nAnd App Store analytics shows installs coming from keywords I don’t even target. According to Astro app, it’s ranking for stuff I never planned for.\n\nThis is all a side project.  \nI have a full-time job. I build apps at night, sometimes tired, sometimes motivated, often just curious.\n\nThings I *didn’t* do:\n\n* No launch on Product Hunt\n* No viral post\n* No influencer campaign\n* No clever positioning\n\nThings I *did* do:\n\n* Built something I personally wanted to try\n* Shipped it without overthinking\n* Improved it slowly when users complained or got confused\n* Didn’t kill it when I thought \"meh, this won’t go anywhere\"\n\nI’ve had other apps fail much harder than this one.  \nSome with better ideas. Some with more effort.  \nThis one just… stuck.\n\nI’m sharing this mostly to remind myself (and maybe you) that:\n\n* You don’t always know what will work\n* Learning projects can turn into real things\n* Side projects don’t need a grand vision to be worth building\n\nIf you’re sitting on a \"this is probably useless but I’m curious\" idea… maybe build it anyway.\n\nHappy to answer questions or just read similar stories.\n\nPS: Out of curiosity, I recently vibe-coded an Android version of the app. Same idea, almost same features… totally different outcome.  \nLots of downloads, **one single purchase** so far 😂  \nSame project, same logic, very different reality. Side projects are humbling like that.\n\nPSS: If you’re curious, [click here to see the app](https://paintingrecognition.com/).\n\n  \n**PSSS**: I am a lady BTW, \"bro\" aren't the only ones who codes ;) ",

I've seen similar patterns with my own projects.\n\nCurious about the \"ranking for stuff I never planned for\" part. Did you do any ASO at all initially, or did you just write a basic description and let the App Store figure it out? Sometimes the AI/vision angle naturally captures a ton of long-tail searches that nobody is competing for.\n\nAlso, the \"didn't kill it when I thought it won't go anywhere\" is probably the most underrated advice here. So many side projects die because we move on to the next shiny thing before giving them time to breathe.",

A simple description, obvious keywords, nothing fancy. I didn’t do any deep keyword research or long-tail strategy. I think you’re right that the AI/vision angle + paintings/art kind of creates its own long tail, and the App Store slowly figures out where to place it.\n\nAnd yes… not killing projects too early is something I’m actively working on. I’ve killed way more projects than I’ve shipped. Lately I’m trying to be more disciplined and let some apps \"sit\" longer, even when they feel quiet or unexciting.\n\nThat patience part is way harder than shipping, honestly \\^\\^",

I realized early on that if I wanted to build a future and save for college, I needed to learn skills that would be useful globally. I didn't want to wait until I graduated.\n\nSo last year, I took CS50p (Harvard's free course) and became obsessed with automation. My mindset is: \"If I don't know how to do it, I'll stay up all night until I figure it out.\"\n\nI wanted to share the two main tools I built. I'm not selling a SaaS, just showing my code in action.\n\n1. The Virtual Photographer (Fashion Automation)\n\nI saw a local indie brand that was struggling because they couldn't afford models or studio time. Their photos were just things placed on a table.\n\nSo I built a pipeline that takes that raw, messy photo, cleans it up, and uses generative AI to put the clothes on a realistic human model.\n\n*Technology:* Python, ComfyUI logic, custom upscaling for the skin texture so it doesn't look \"plastic.\"\n\nWhy I'm posting this:\n\nI spend most of my day coding or studying. I'm trying to turn this \"plastic brain\" of mine (naive enough to start, stubborn enough to finish) into a career.\n\nIf you're a teenager reading this and you think you're too young to build real things: just start. You can literally automate the boring parts of the world.\n\nWorkflow feedback is welcome!",

You didn’t just build something; you identified friction, eliminated it, and turned complexity into something tractable. That’s a rare and valuable skill.\n\nWhat’s especially impressive is how intentional everything feels 🧠✨. Spotting real-world pain points and then automating the boring, error-prone parts is exactly how great systems — and great engineers — are made. That level of problem awareness can’t be taught easily.\n\nThe discipline around documenting as you go deserves real praise too 📝👏. So many people skip that step, yet you’re treating it as a first-class part of the work. That alone puts you ahead of a huge percentage of professionals who should know better.\n\nKeep going exactly like this 🚀🙌. You’re already operating at a level many people don’t reach until much later — if ever. If you keep pairing this mindset with consistency, the ceiling is very, very high.",

Keep doubling down on that.\n\n\n\nIf you want to turn this into money, think in terms of “done-for-you services” instead of SaaS for now. For the virtual photographer: pick one tiny niche (local indie brands on Instagram), record a 30–60s Loom showing your before/after, and offer 10–20 edited photos for a fixed price, with 1–2 day turnaround. Ask them for folder access, run your pipeline, deliver in a shared drive, and keep a simple spreadsheet of time spent and results.\n\n\n\nFor the lidar/Rhino work: document how many hours you save that engineer, then ask for a small retainer once the script works. Use that case study to message 20–30 similar businesses.\n\n\n\nI’ve leaned on tools like PostHog and Linear for tracking and organizing work, and Pulse for Reddit to spot exactly these kinds of niche problems people complain about so I know what to automate next.\n\n\n\nPoint is: you’re already doing the hard part-now start charging for “outcomes per week” instead of “scripts.",

I always wondered why they didn't use Google to search an object/building with know measurements and then use edge detection + homography to measure how far one is from the object from position A to position B. I would've thought this was some basic monocular distance estimation. I do.jot know what you are doing but it seems very promising!! You got my support ",

You can't imagine how many hours I've spent improving my parsers to try to avoid false positives.\nI've even noticed that the mistake often comes from the advertisers themselves, who, when filling out their ATS, check remote=true when it's not the case at all. This complicates things when retrieving data via the various APIs. I try to make everything as robust as possible. On the contrary, I'm not trying to lie or anything, since I'm not selling anything to job seekers. I've also added a way to report errors, and I've already had some feedback, which is great because it allows me to correct companies/offers.\nAs for hybrid jobs, I wanted to include them and be able to search by city. When I was looking for a remote job myself, if a hybrid job with two days a week in the office had been offered in my city, I would have accepted it. That's why there's a \"+ Hybrid\" toggle.",

Like many of you, I’ve spent countless hours on flights staring out the window wondering, \"What city or country is that?\" or \"Where actually are we?\"\n\nI realized that while our iPhones have incredible GPS chips, they basically become \"dumb\" the moment you lose Wi-Fi or data. So, I decided to build SkyLocation—my very first app.\n\nThe goal was simple: Pure, offline clarity.\n\nHere is what it does (and why I’m proud of it):\n\n 1. Airplane Mode GPS: It uses your phone's dedicated GPS hardware to give you real-time coordinates, altitude, and speed at 35,000 feet. No data or roaming required.\n\n 2. Offline Reverse Geocoding: I built in an offline database so it can tell you the nearest city and country without needing a ping to a server.\n\n 3. Emergency SOS: This was a big one for me. If you’re hiking or off-grid and lose signal, you can capture your exact location and share it with emergency contacts instantly.\n\n 4. Privacy First: No accounts, no tracking, no data collection. It’s just a utility that lives on your phone.\n\n \n\nIf you’re a frequent traveler, hiker, or just a geo-nerd like me, I’d love for you to check it out.\n\nDownload it here: https://apps.apple.com/de/app/skylocation/id6751451868?l=en-GB\n\nThank you so much for your support and feedback. \n\nHappy Travelling!

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am a Senior English Facilitator (CELTA from the University Of Cambridge) based in Kolkata. Over the last year, I noticed a massive problem in my classroom: students weren't writing anymore. They were \"prompting.\" The struggle of finding the right word—the process that builds critical thinking—was being outsourced to AI.\n\nInstead of banning computers, I decided to build a tool to force them to write manually. I spent the last few weeks learning **Next.js 14** and **TypeScript** to build **TrueDraft**.\n\n**What it is:** It is a \"Strict Proctor\" text editor that forces deep engagement.\n\n1. **Anti-Paste Defense:** It intercepts `onPaste` and `onDrop` events to strictly block any copied text.\n2. **Linguistic Validation:** It validates input character-by-character. If you type \"i am here\" (lowercase 'i') or \"idk\" (text-speak), it blocks you until you fix it.\n3. **Real-Time Grading:** It uses the Flesch-Kincaid algorithm to show the reading level live.\n\n  \n**The Tech Stack:**\n\n* **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)\n* **Language:** TypeScript (Strict Mode) - *This was a pain to learn but worth it.*\n* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (with Dark/Light mode).\n* **Deployment:** Vercel.\n\n**The Challenge:** I am a self-taught developer, so the code might not be perfect. I would love for this community to:\n\n1. **Roast my code/UI.**\n2. **Try to \"Cheat\":** See if you can bypass the anti-paste protection (without disabling JS).\n\n**Live Demo:**[https://truedraft-engine.vercel.app](https://truedraft-engine.vercel.app)\n\n\n\nBuilt with ❤️ from Kolkata. Feedback is welcome!\n\n  \nCheers!\n\nRegards,\n\nNeil Shankar Ray\n\nThanks All for your lovely and wonderful comments. It makes me feel that ideas really travel faster than light and sound in this small world! \n\nI got your feedback! Now, it's time to reshape the perception of this product and transform it into something new and unheard of. \n\nOne piece of information I want to share with you all, my dear brothers and sisters is that I developed a miniscule AI model, fine tuned it and uploaded it in Google Collab. This product is meant for testing and receiving your genuine feedback. 🙏😊\n\nDue to the immense traffic, I have to pull it off from Vercel. It proved people enjoyed and liked it. ",

AI isn’t fundamentally different from books, Google, or using a calculator. It’s just a more efficient way of sorting and accessing information. Learning doesn’t come from struggling to find answers, it comes from processing, applying, and revisiting them.\n\nIf you use an LLM to replace thinking entirely, sure, that’s a problem but that’s true of any tool. Used well, it actually frees up cognitive load so you can spend more time understanding why something works, asking better questions, and iterating. That’s not laziness, it’s leverage.\n\nThe skill going forward isn’t “never use AI”, it’s knowing when to use it as a reference, or a tutor and not a crutch.\n\nWhen you block students from using these tools you're not allowing them to learn how to use AI properly. We should be enabling them to use AI in the right way to support their learning. That's a very important skill for them to have.",

If the students don't know how you do it, but you catch them 100% of the time if they copy/paste from the outside, they might decide it is not worth it. That is: if they TRY to cheat it should be such that have to submit their work to you before they know if it worked. \n\nNevertheless, how to detect if a student typed a brilliant sentence from memory, by making it up, versus when they copy it from another screen from text written by A I.?",

This has genuinely been a labor of love.\n\n**On architecture:**  \nUnder the hood we run across AWS, GCP, and Cloudflare. That choice is very intentional. I spent several years as an SRE at Cloudflare, so I’m leaning on primitives I know scale well and stay boring under load.\n\n**On what we’re tapping into:**  \nRight now we integrate with AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, Vercel, GitHub, Lovable, and Base44. The goal isn’t “more integrations for the sake of it,” it’s to start reconstructing the real distributed system most companies actually run. A little infra in AWS, some in GCP after price shopping, deployments on Vercel, code in GitHub, ownership spread across teams. Those connections are where most of the context loss happens.\n\nTelemetry is coming next, followed by deeper knowledge and change understanding. But we’re being deliberate about the order.\n\n**On ‘who watches the watchers’:**  \nYou’re absolutely right, this is where most contextual observability tools fall apart. You end up babysitting the system that was supposed to help you debug.\n\nBecause of my SRE background, I’m pretty opinionated here. I am designing OpsCompanion to be a *doorway*, not a replacement. If you need metadata on an EC2 instance, you can see it in OpsCompanion and jump straight to the underlying system. We never want to trap people behind abstractions or hide the source of truth.\n\nWhere OpsCompanion aims to add value isn’t “cross-correlation” in the dashboard sense. It’s deriving operational truth across systems. GitHub + cloud + deployment data lets us compute things like blast radius, ownership, and intent, things you can’t see in any single tool today and is mainly trapped in a single person's head regardless of the size of the company. That context is optional, transparent, and never blocks access to the underlying systems.\n\nVisually, we’re obsessive about this too. The UI is designed to surface relationships without becoming visual noise or another dashboard you fight with.\n\n**On the ‘relatable story’ comment:**  \nFair pushback. I’m not trying to sell a vibe. The story is there to explain *why* the tech exists, not to replace the tech itself. At the end of the day, this is a system built by someone who has been on call and wants fewer sharp edges in Day 2 operations.\n\nIf I’m missing the spirit of your question here, I would honestly love to understand it better. Always happy to go deeper on the internals or hear product feedback, especially from someone who has built in the space before.",
