Local wiki dump with llm-based RAG system would be a quite useful feature as well. So definitely a step in the right direction. Might be quite useful in a couple of years considering recent developments.",

You run the risk of getting people wayy overconfident and relaxed in survival situations.\n\nwhat is the benefit of this heavy box over my phone, which i have on me anyways? I cant really see the situation where things are both bad enough where i need this yet good enough where i can still charge it.\n\nWouldn't this make more sens as like an auto response bot that can be reached via a satphone.. like a garmin inreach?",

              "text": "Hi there! Thank you!!\n\nYeah, beyond the AI providing sources for its answers, we have confidence scores and have proactively ensured anything to do with mushrooms is low confidence. It should also tell you to just avoid mushrooms too.\n\nThere are some solutions to the temperature, position, and altitude i'm excited about so I'll wait to implement them and  share. The guidance takes a proactive approach because you're right, they may think they intuitively know their survival priorities when they actually don't\n\nFor me personally, and from what I've heard it's that the device (3lbs, less than a foot wide), is rugged (you can run it over with a car and it's fine), waterproof (more so than a phone), and comes with upgraded capabilities for all features. The battery lasts a few hours so the thought would be in this version that it's for any situation where you need a few hours of guidance (lost in the wild, natural disasters, etc). I think it's a cool thing to have\n\nSo from my research \\~90% of people who get lost in the wild have their phone and have satellite yet many people still die. Satellite takes a few minutes sending/receiving, only supports a few words of text per message, isn't reliable, and is power hungry.   \n  \nImagine getting guidance from a bot where it takes a few mins to send your message, few mins to receive a reply, only to get a few words at a time. Let's hope it's not cloudy, there isn't tree coverage, you're not stuck in cave, etc (you need clear line of sight). \n\nNow contrast that with having almost instant answers with pictures, confidence scores, an AI that provides sources for its answers to a library of study guides stored on-device, maps, etc. Our battery life again lasts a few hours and will only get better too\n\nGood points though! Thanks for the feedback",

But with the app covering the weekend adventure side of things. And the Device not really being suitable for an actual emergency survival situation.. this is a cool thing to have, im just unsure if its really practical or more just a gimmick for the prepper bros (no offence).",

      "text": "**TL;DR: You don't need a technical co-founder anymore. You need to start.**\n\nFor years, I told myself I couldn't start a company because I wasn't a \"builder.\"\n\nI had ideas. I had domain expertise. But I couldn't code. And every startup playbook said: \"Find a technical co-founder or give up.\"\n\nSo I did what desperate wannabe founders do: I joined an accelerator program, surrounded myself with \"founder energy,\" and spent a year watching technical founders build while I... networked?\n\nOne year later, I felt like shit. I was 35. Still no company. Still waiting for permission.\n\n**Then something clicked.**\n\nI realized the game had changed. In 2025, you don't need to write code to build a company. You need to validate demand and execute fast.\n\nSo I gave myself 90 days to prove I could build a real B2B business without writing a single line of code.\n\n**The Stack That Replaced a Technical Co-Founder**\n\nHere's what I actually used:\n\n**1. Cursor (for building)**\n\n* I'm not a developer, but Cursor + Claude let me ship a functional MVP in 3 weeks\n*  Just me and AI pair programming.\n* Finish my platform in 3 months.\n\n**2. Loom (for recording)**\n\n* Forget fancy demos. I recorded 2-minute Loom videos showing the problem + solution\n* Sent 47 personalized videos in week 1. Got 8 calls booked.\n\n**3. Starnus (for selling)**\n\n* Needed a way to find and reach potential customers without spending all day on LinkedIn\n* Set up my ICP criteria, it finds matching leads and automates the outreach part\n* Went from 15 hours/week manual prospecting to maybe 2 hours checking responses\n\n**4. Notion (for everything else)**\n\n* Roadmap, customer feedback, sales pipeline, content calendar\n* One workspace. No complexity.\n\n**The Results (90 Days)**\n\n* **Week 1-2:** Validated idea with 23 customer conversations (all inbound from targeted outreach)\n* **Week 3-4:** Built MVP with Cursor\n* **Week 5-8:** Sent 200+ personalized outreach messages via Starnus\n* **Week 9-12:** 37 demo calls, 4 paying customers, $1,847 MRR\n\nI'm not rich. I'm not \"successful\" yet. But I have a real business with real customers paying real money.\n\n**The Uncomfortable Truth**\n\nMost founders fail because they build in isolation for months, then hope customers show up.\n\nI did the opposite:\n\n1. Found people with the problem\n2. Validated they'd pay (conversations)\n3. Built the solution \n4. Sold it \n\nRevenue came before product. Customers came before code.\n\n**What This Makes Me Think**\n\nThe \"non-technical founder\" excuse is dead.\n\nYou don't need to learn to code. You don't need a CTO. You need:\n\n* A real problem people will pay to solve\n* AI tools to build and automate the boring stuff\n* The courage to start before you're ready\n\nI wasted a year waiting for permission. Don't make the same mistake.\n\n  \nIf you're a non-technical founder sitting on an idea, stop waiting. Start validating.\n\nThe hardest part isn't building. It's starting.",

Now I'm scrambling to figure out where my actual audience hangs out (turns out it's not the indie hacker community lol).\n\nQuestion: did you use Starnus for B2C outreach or purely B2B?

I kick off the task, step away, then check back later. \n\n  \nYou mentioned the permission mindset being the biggest blocker. Totally agree. The mental shift from waiting to have everything figured out to learning by doing changed everything for me too.\n\n  \nOne practical tip for anyone earlier in this journey: if you want to keep iterating even when youre away from your laptop, there are mobile tools that let you SSH into your dev environment. I use one called Moshi for checking on Claude Code sessions from my phone. Useful when youre testing something and want to monitor progress without being chained to your desk.\n\n  \nWhat were the biggest technical blockers you hit during the MVP build?

The first one goes live in about 2 weeks.\n\nEverywhere I look, it's 20-something founders shipping their second or third company. Moving fast, pivoting overnight, building audiences of 50K like it's nothing.\n\nAnd here I am, just getting started.\n\nBut I've been around the block. Built other businesses, made money, lost money, learned a few things about what people actually want vs what I think they want.

I can smell when an idea is already validated vs when I'm building in the dark. I know that trying to compete head-to-head in a crowded space is suicide - you need to carve out your corner first.\n\nThese aren't things you learn from a course. You learn them by screwing up enough times.\n\nStill, some days I wonder if I should've done this 20 years ago. Other days I think starting now is exactly right.\n\nI'm documenting the whole thing on X, Threads and here on Reddit as I go. Not because I have it figured out, but because maybe there are others out there doing the same thing and we can learn from each other.\n\nIf you're in your 40s (or beyond) building something, I'd genuinely love to hear how it's going for you.

          "text": "44 here, just shipped my first product 11 days ago after 20 years in B2B sales. Zero sales so far but the learning curve is wild. You're absolutely right about the instinct thing. I can smell bullshit product ideas a mile away now - stuff I would've wasted 6 months on in my 20s, I skip in 5 minutes because I've watched enough companies burn money on \"solutions\" nobody asked for. The age thing is weird though. On one hand, I have the patience and discipline to actually finish something (younger me would've quit after Day 3). On the other hand, watching 23-year-olds with 50K followers making $10K/month while I'm at Day 11 with 0 sales is... humbling haha ;) But here's what I notice: the young founders pivot fast because they can afford to fail 10 times. We can't. So we ship slower but more deliberately. That's not a weakness, it's just a different game. Also - you're doing 6 products in 12 months? That's ambitious as hell. Are you validating each one before building or just shipping fast and seeing what sticks? 42 days in is nothing. You're just getting started. Let us know when Product #1 launches! Congrats on taking this leap btw! 💪👏",

First of all, you 0 sales is more than normal thing, it is the \"Slowly, then suddenly\" type of thing, once you fine tune your GTM strategy and reach the right audience, then the \"suddenly part\" kicks in.\n\nYou are right, 6 products in 12 months it is absolutely scary, but the idea is exactly the one you've mentioned \"shipping fast and seeing what sticks\", we can definitely not market 6 products at the same time alone (my co-founder and me), so, we will simply dismissed what doesn't work and move forward. At the same time, some of those products are \"boring products\" (not novel ideas, things that already work, are already proven, and have already audience paying for these type of products), so, we are mixing \"novel ideas\" perhaps nobody wants (big risk) that we would need to validate before hand, with proven ideas we know that are already validated.\n\nWhat is your product about by the way? Best of luck",

We just don't see the graveyard.\n\n\n\n\"As long as you enjoy the process - just keep trying.\"\n\n\n\nThis is it. If I'm going to fail (again), might as well enjoy the ride. The process is actually the wohle point - the outcome is just a nice bonus if it happens.\n\n\n\nThanks for the respect and the perspective. Means a lot coming from someone who's seen both sides.",

I too started late in the game as well, at 45 making my first app. I would caution on trying to launch 6 products in 12 months and instead focus on getting the first one out.   \n\n\nIf you are able to smell out a good idea, then the other big advice I wish someone had shared with me sooner is this, make sure you market and build your brand and network. You will need that for future iterations. Bringing multiple apps in a year just complicate that as your message and vision will be misunderstood by the average person that, if they even do see your idea which is challenging without ads, marketing, SEO, word of mouth, etc, will still wonder if App X from you is different from App Y and how did you make that many and support them. If you focus on one App then they will think of you and then in the future if it had their needs met, will have slightly more trust that you made something for them in the first place. It also allows you to message them in the future with the next launch and get more buzz going.\n\nGood Luck!",

I'm in my early 30s but started my AI journey later than most in the space, and I constantly battle that feeling of 'everyone else is 10 steps ahead.'\n\nBut here's what I've learned: your timing actually gives you an unfair advantage. Those 20-something founders are moving fast, sure, but they're also making a lot of rookie mistakes at scale. You already know how to validate ideas, manage resources, and read market signals. That's not something you can learn from a course or a Twitter thread.\n\nThe biggest mistake I see is people trying to compete on energy and speed when experience and judgment are actually more valuable. You're building 6 products in 12 months - that's ambitious, but I'd encourage you to think about quality of validation over quantity of launches. One product with real traction beats six experiments that never find product-market fit.\n\nAlso, documenting in public is smart. The meta-narrative of 'founder in their 40s building' is itself differentiated positioning. People want to follow journeys, not just products.\n\nLooking forward to seeing what you ship. The fact that you're questioning yourself is probably a good sign - it means you're thinking critically rather than just building in a bubble.",

Young founders often ship fast but pivot slowly because they lack the pattern recognition that comes from real world experience.\n\n  \nOne thing I noticed from going through something similar: the 6 products in 12 months approach actually works better at our age because you already know how to kill your darlings. Younger me would have spent 8 months polishing product 1 instead of learning from the market across multiple attempts.\n\n  \nThe documenting part is smart too. Even if none of the 6 products take off, the content becomes its own asset. Some of the best founder audiences were built during the struggle, not after the win.\n\n  \n42 days in with a launch around the corner is real momentum. Most people are still thinking about it at day 42.",

Limited context window.   \nIf you have a large meeting, like 1h or something, the transcript is relatively big and can't fit in the single request. You are limited to 4k of tokens roughly. Which is not enough. I could split this into chunks with overlapping parts, but still, the summary of the meeting would be far from ideal.  \nRegarding speech recognition.  I tried various models, even bundled Whisper into the app initially.  \nWith Whisper, you need a large model to do proper STT, and it's slow.  \nApple's native STT API is exptremelly good imo. It's fast and predictable.\n\nOne limitation I discovered is that you can't transcribe two separate audio streams at the same time. You def need to mix audio buffers into a single stream. And it also has a 1m length limit for the buffer.",

THE LAUNCH TRIFECTA) :**\n\n1. **Timing** \\- when you launch/post matters more than what you post. Kinda.\n   * Wrong: Do exactly what everybody else is doing. Launch another website builder :D\n   * Right: Think what is at the overlap between what you like to get absurdly deep into, now can be done diffrenetly than a few years ago, people actively talk that they need it. Yup, it's hard, nobody said it wouldn't be.\n2. **Hook** \\- you have 2 seconds to stop the scroll\n   * Wrong: \"Check out my new app!\"\n   * Right: Value. Come on, help others, nobody will help you if you don't help others. Sorry folks, I'm one of the guys that think mentioning your product name is 100% ok, but just try to deliver value. Make it free for one day for you audience, make the post funny, tell something truly useful worth remembering and unique. Again, nobody said that founding projects is easy.\n3. **Landing** \\- where you send traffic\n   * Wrong: \"We revolutionize the world one step at a time\"\n   * Right: Combat your need for aesthetics (here's where I sometimes fall myself) or perfection. Just make the value is as clear as possible. Better to make it clear but small than grand but not clear. I've had websites that had spelling mistakes do well because there was a clear USP and clear job that the product does. The other way around (pretty website, \"world anew\" claim) rarely works.\n\n\\---------\n\n\n\nDrop your project below with:\n\n* Link\n* One-line description\n* Where you're planning to launch \n\n  \nI'll do quick teardowns for first 10 or so (an eventful day for me today, so be patient, I should be able to reply to everybody within usually like 1-2hrs tops). No selling, just genuinely want to help. Seeing too many great projects get buried. If you are super good, I won't be able to help, but if there's a mistake that you are missing, I may be able to spot it in 5s, so just drop a link and let's have some fun!",

Here goes:\n\n  \nLink: [getmoshi.app](http://getmoshi.app)\n\n  \nOne-line: Mobile terminal that lets you control AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, etc) from your iPhone.\n\n  \nWhere Im launching: Already on the App Store (free beta), planning Product Hunt soon.\n\n  \nThe problem it solves: AI coding agents like Claude Code run long tasks (10-30 min) and sometimes need human input mid-task. Right now you have to sit at your laptop waiting. With Moshi you get a push notification when it needs you, approve from your phone, and go back to whatever you were doing.\n\n  \nKey differentiator vs other terminal apps: Uses the Mosh protocol instead of plain SSH so your session survives wifi drops, phone sleep, subway tunnels etc. Also has on-device voice-to-terminal (Whisper runs locally, no cloud) which sounds gimmicky but is actually useful when youre on the couch and your agent needs a quick yes/no.\n\n  \nBiggest concern: Niche is maybe too narrow? AI coding agents are growing fast but the intersection of \"uses coding agents\" and \"wants mobile access\" might be small right now. Curious what you think.",

People will literally give you a 1 star review just to protest the pricing model even if they never tried the app. Switched to a one-time purchase and the tone of feedback completely changed overnight.\n\n  \nYour point about privacy-first being a tradeoff is the most underrated insight here. I went the same route (no analytics, no accounts) and it does feel like flying blind. What helped me was adding an optional in-app feedback button that sends a plain text email. No tracking, no accounts, but you get qualitative signal from the people who care enough to write. Even 5 of those a week gives you more useful direction than aggregate analytics dashboards.\n\n  \nOn the B2C marketing side, the community approach is the way. I found that commenting genuinely in niche subs where my users actually hang out (not spamming launch posts) drove more installs than any ad spend. The trick is that it takes months to compound and most people quit after week 2.\n\n  \n$1.5k in 3 months on a nights-and-weekends project is legit. The people who call that small usually have never shipped anything themselves.",

It bundles FFmpeg/Pandoc inside, so it works 100% offline.\n* **Universal:**\n   * **Media:** Video (WebM, MP4, GIF) & Images (WebP, ICNS, HEIC), Audio (MP4, WAV)\n   * **Docs:** Markdown or RTF to docx\n   * **Data:** JSON to YAML\n   * **Geospatial data**: GeoJSON, Shapefile, KML\n* **Open Source:** AGPL licensed. You can build it from source or buy the signed binary (lifetime license).

I’ve been tinkering with voice synthesis for a while, and I finally built something good enough to share:\n\n[imiteo.com￼](https://imiteo.com/) — a voice cloning tool that can clone a voice from a short audio sample.\n\nThe workflow is simple:  \n  \n• Upload or record a voice clip (even a few seconds can work)  \n• The app transcribes it automatically  \n• Enter the text you want spoken  \n• Click generate, and get cloned audio back in seconds\n\nI’ve been genuinely surprised by how well it performs, even with short inputs. No registration, No email.\n\nIt currently supports 10 languages: English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, German, French, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian.\n\nLanguage detection is automatic, so you don’t need to manually pick the transcription language.\n\nIf you’re curious about the stack:\n\n• nextjs, react  \n• Front Cloudflare Worker  \n• GPU L4\n\nI’d really love feedback—what works, what doesn’t, and what you’d like to see next. I’m actively improving it, so any thoughts are super helpful.\n\nTry it here: [imiteo.com￼](https://imiteo.com/)\n\nWould love to hear what you think!",

I never send notes to Drive; I don't see the point. I already have the Remarkable app on my various devices, so it's pointless for me.\n\nThat's my workflow. Where I lose time (and maybe information) is with the transitions between handwriting (whiteboard or Remarkable) and organizing in Workflowy.",
