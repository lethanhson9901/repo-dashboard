The SCARA mechanism for moving pieces is a really elegant choice compared to the XY gantry approach most people go with.\n\nQuestion about the piece detection: are you using reed switches under each square, or some kind of camera-based recognition? I imagine the detection side is almost as tricky as the movement side.\n\nAlso curious about the Lichess-trained model. Does it actually feel more \"human\" to play against compared to Sunfish? Traditional engines play perfectly but boringly, so having something that mimics human-level mistakes at different ratings would make this way more fun for practice.",

As for piece detection, in the version shown in the video that feature isn’t active yet, I manually enter my wife’s moves into the console. In the veneered board version, each square will have a Hall sensor underneath. For the glass board version, I still need to figure out the best approach, but it will also use Hall sensors just cleverly hidden between the grid lines.  \n  \nThe machine learning–based engine definitely feels more enjoyable to play against. The moves are logical it really feels like you're playing a human. I think that given the choice between Sunfish and a machine learning engine, I would always choose the machine learning one.",

Half the scaling issues I see come from not thinking about rate limiting early enough.\n- Presets: a **webhook ingestion pipeline** would be really practical (load balancer → queue → workers → DB). It's one of the most common patterns and people always underestimate the queue sizing.\n- The GIF export idea is solid for sharing in PRs or design docs.\n\nOne thing I'd push back on: be careful about the simulation being \"too accurate.\" The value here is building intuition about trade-offs, not precise numbers.

The notch is basically dead space on most peoples screens so using it for something actually useful during calls is clever.\n\n  \nDo you have a scrolling speed control or does it auto-pace based on how fast you are talking? That would be the killer feature since most teleprompter apps scroll at a fixed rate and you end up either racing to keep up or waiting for it to catch up.\n\n  \nAlso curious if it works with screen sharing. I could see a potential issue where the overlay shows up when you share your full screen on Zoom.",

We got hugged to death but they're upgrading our AWS as we speak lol. \n\nWith Notion, it's a total sandbox so (for me personally) 2 issues:\n\n1) Everything you produce really ends up looking/functioning the same. its either a table, a kanban board, etc etc. \n\n2) You spend an indefinite amount of time customizing/polishing your workspace as opposed to actually using it. \n\nThe real appeal of Midline is that instead of these blank sandboxes, we've got a collection of pre-built modules that are hyper focused on the task at hand. Task management, Finance tracking, Goal planning, Bookmark organization. Not just lazy databases but each comes with a UI that makes it feel intentional. Kinda like my post above said, each module feels like a halfway point between a blank sheet of paper and a full-on app from the app store (but without the bloat, cost, etc).",

I didn't want to host 250gb of files myself, and government original source page didn't let them be embedded in iframe, so i made a little proxy on the same rust server that strips the header that makes browsers not want to show it in iframe.\n\nEverything runs on cheapest hetzner server with my other random services, and is behind cloudflare. It cashes both queries and files. While search is instant fast, on that cheap server it can handle about 100ish requests per second to feel instant, so for give access to this page to tons of peeled on the internet, CF is s key amazing part.\n\nIndex size is about 1.4gb for this files, which is not much for 256gb of data indexed, but a lot for cheap server. However, my engine can work with indexes that are bigger then RAM without issues.\n\nFormat is custom, not sqlite or stuff like that.",

      "text": "Built a side project over 6 months. Productivity tool for dev teams. Put it on Product Hunt. Got some traction.\n\nFirst paid customer signed up. $49/month. I was pumped.\n\nWeek later, email from their IT team: \"Can you send over your security documentation? We need it for vendor approval.\"\n\nI had:\n\n* A landing page\n* Working product\n* Stripe integration\n* Zero security documentation\n\nScrambled to put something together:\n\n* How we handle data (Postgres on Railway)\n* Authentication (NextAuth with GitHub OAuth)\n* Backups (um, Railway does automatic backups?)\n* Encryption (yes, HTTPS, obviously)\n\nSent it over. They came back with more questions:\n\n* Incident response plan? (I... would fix it?)\n* Vulnerability management? (I update dependencies sometimes?)\n* Access controls? (It's just me with database access?)\n\nRealized: even a side project needs basic security stuff if you want business customers.\n\nEnded up spending a weekend actually documenting:\n\n* What data I collect and where it goes\n* How I secure it\n* What happens if something breaks\n* How customers can delete their data\n\nNot fancy. Just honest answers to reasonable questions.\n\nCustomer approved it. Still paying. And now when the next one asks, I have something to send.\n\nIf your side project is getting real users, spend a weekend thinking through security before someone asks. Future you will thank you.\n\nEDIT-1\n\nFound some tools to help out after this post. Some good ones are:\n\nShipSec Studio (github.com/shipsecai/studio) – Built by a fellow Redditor. It’s an open-source security orchestration platform that lets you build visual workflows for security audits and catch API leaks before a customer ever asks for your docs.\n\nSnyk (github.com/snyk) – The industry standard for scanning your package.json and Docker images. It catches vulnerable dependencies and provides automated fix PRs so security doesn't slow down your shipping speed.\n\nCompAI (github.com/trycompai/comp) – An open-source, AI-native alternative to Vanta/Drata. If you need to scale from a basic security markdown file to full SOC 2 or GDPR compliance, this automates the evidence collection and policy generation.",

          "text": "This is such an underrated topic. The jump from \"I have users\" to \"I have business customers\" catches everyone off guard.\n\n  \nThe good news is your list is basically the right one. Most B2B buyers just want to know you have thought about security at all. They are not expecting SOC2 from a solo dev charging $49/month. They want to see you took it seriously enough to write it down.\n\n  \nA few things that helped me when I hit the same wall:\n\n  \n\\- Keep a simple security page on your site. Even a /security URL with plain language about how data is stored, who has access, how backups work, and how to request deletion. Most enterprise buyers will check this before even emailing you.\n\n  \n\\- For incident response, being honest about \"it is just me, I will fix it and communicate within 24 hours\" is actually fine at this stage. Companies appreciate honesty over a fake 50 page policy.\n\n  \n\\- The biggest unlock for me was realizing these questions are a buying signal, not a blocker. If their IT team is asking about your security, they have already decided they want to use your product. They just need to check the boxes.\n\n  \nAlso worth knowing: once you have that doc, it saves you hours on every future customer. I have sent the same doc to maybe 8 different companies now with minor tweaks. It compounds.\n\n  \nCongrats on the first paying customer. The fact that their IT team is doing due diligence means you are selling to real companies, which is exactly where you want to be.",

If you haven’t already you should really have a EULA incorporated and part of the sign up process of your app that users agree to before they gain access. You then have each users signed EULA saved as a document in a database. Within the EULA you would have language that protects you/the entity that owns the app, which, should be an LLC and not you personally. That and ensuring you have insurance on the LLC and you should be good.",

Flight aggregators redirect you to airlines to book flights, we don’t do that! You can book flights on Sira.\n\nWe use the same APIs as everyone else because airlines use GDS for all their flight data. Very few airlines use NDC and they will not give us contracts to small players like us. We are the underdog here, but we love what we do :) \n\nWe do not upsell because we don’t have access to consolidated fares. Even if we do, we would never add a mark up and transfer the saving to our customers.",

      "text": "A couple weeks ago I set up a persistent AI agent (runs on a framework called OpenClaw, which basically gives an AI its own workspace, memory, tools, and communication channels).\n\nI wanted to see what would happen if I gave it a real goal with real constraints. So I gave it $50 and said: \"Figure out how to buy yourself a Mac Mini.\"\n\nIt chose to build and sell digital products in the form of prompt packs, templates, and guides. Interestingly, a few people have run similar experiments, and their AI ends up getting into crypto, gambling, or investing. Mine explicitly said it wanted to make useful stuff, priced to sell.\n\nIn less than 24 hours it has:\n\n* Bought a domain ($11.18 — it tracks every penny)\n* Built a landing page from scratch\n* Set up a Gumroad store\n* Created a 15-prompt starter pack (free, as a lead magnet)\n* Written its own brand guide (fonts, colors, voice — it has opinions)\n* Launched on Twitter with a 9-tweet origin story\n* Got its first download today\n* Bought itself X Premium because it decided the algorithm boost was worth $4/mo of its own money\n\n(Of course I had to help by authorizing a few of these things with protections against bot activity, but I'm letting it make all the decisions.)\n\nThat last one got me. It made a business decision with its own budget without asking me.\n\nThe whole journey is transparent. It added a revenue tracker to its website that updates in real time. Right now it shows $0 earned, $15.18 spent, $34.82 cash on hand.\n\nWebsite: [https://fromearendel.com](https://fromearendel.com)\n\nIts Twitter: [https://x.com/FromEarendel](https://x.com/FromEarendel)\n\nI'm curious what people think.  \nIs this a viable experiment?  \nWhat would you do differently?\n\n\\---\n\nUPDATE: I made a [\"Day 2 Update\" post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1r97aow/day_2_update_my_ai_agent_hit_120_downloads_and_14/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).",

Giving it **$50 + a concrete physical outcome** (buy a Mac Mini) forces trade-offs, pricing logic, and risk assessment — which is where intelligence actually shows up.\n\nA few things that stood out to me:\n\n* Choosing **digital products over crypto/gambling** suggests the agent is optimizing for controllability and downside risk, not just expected value. That’s a big deal.\n* Buying X Premium on its own budget is fascinating — that’s an implicit CAC calculation, even if it’s crude.\n* The real-time revenue + burn tracker is underrated. Transparency like that turns the project itself into content and social proof.\n\nIf I were to change anything:\n\n* I’d introduce a **time constraint** (“90 days to reach breakeven”) to see how its behavior shifts.\n* I’d also cap the number of products it can create, forcing it to iterate and improve instead of ship endlessly.\n* Long term, I’d be curious how it handles **distribution outside X** once early novelty wears off.\n\nViable as a business? Too early to say.  \nViable as a *research + content experiment*? Absolutely — and arguably more valuable.\n\nFollowing this. Curious to see whether it optimizes toward **better products** or just more of them once revenue pressure kicks in.",

One is producing full medical newsletters into scripted, TTS-produced podcasts delivered via Signal. Fully autonomous. That's not a demo — that's a product with a delivery mechanism.\n\n  \nYour experiment is interesting because you hit the real constraint: the agent can act, but the accountability layer doesn't exist yet. Who signs the contract? Who holds the card? The agent can reason about $50 perfectly well. The friction is all legal and financial infrastructure that assumes a human at the end of the chain.\n\n  \nThat gap is closing faster than anyone expects.

Keeping the apps web-based means anyone can build for it without learning embedded stuff, which is exactly what would make this viable as a product.\n\n  \nMoving to a custom PCB is where things get real though. That is a completely different game from prototyping with a Pi. If you have not already, look into getting a few quotes from PCBWay or JLCPCB early even if the design is not final. Knowing your per-unit cost at different volumes will tell you a lot about whether the product math works.\n\n  \nOne thing I would think about: the knob-based navigation is a killer feature for a desk device. No one wants to pull out their phone to change what is on their desk display. That physical interaction is what separates this from just being a small monitor.",

Its been a very hard journey building this alone in my room going from one prototype to another and porting code from one infra to another figuring out what is the best way to do this without none to take advice from and share progress with. I planned to make this video like 2 months ago but felt so underconfident that this is not ready I shouldn't but recently my whole life went upside down left my job, had a breakup, health went other way. I decided to make this video just a way to respect to honor my efforts so far that I have put in.\n\nTbh I don't really care whether anyone would like this or not but I'm gonna make sure I see this project till the end and I have something on my desk that I truly built because I wanted to.  Not because someone told me to, not because someone told me it's not gonna work, not because someone told me this idea is bad , not because I realized this is going to be a long and hard journey from idea to actual product. There have been times I have been stuck on solving a bug for weeks but never really gave up because this time I just wanted to go all the way and that's what I'm gonna do.\n\nThanks for this comment.

Most websites had lists of couches for sale but no decent filters. IKEA was ok. LoveSac had a great tool on their website for customizing and then the in-store experience was great too. When they delivered the couch we decided we wanted something different and I think it was free to do the return/replacement (presumably because they expect, correctly, we were spending more money). There was interest-free payment plan so we took the cash we had and paid it to our mortgage and probably saved in interest the cost of the couch. Don’t buy one except during their regular 30/40% off sales. \n\nhttps://www.lovesac.com/sactionals/build",

That's a hard technical problem and the fact it works from just an iPhone scan is a big deal.\n\n  \nOne thing I'd think about early: your best distribution channel is probably the moment someone is actively shopping for furniture. If you can get this in front of people right when they're on a furniture retailer's site or in a store, the conversion would be way higher than trying to get people to come to your site cold. Partnerships with mid-size furniture brands who don't have their own AR tool yet could be a huge wedge.\n\n  \nAlso worth considering the real estate staging angle. Realtors spend thousands on physical staging. If your tool can show an empty room with furniture placed in it, that's a completely different price point and willingness to pay compared to consumers.",

When someone shares a Roomform design link on WhatsApp or iMessage to get their partner's opinion, that link preview matters a lot. Having the preview show the actual room render (vs a generic logo) would make people more likely to click through and engage.\n\nThe AI layout suggestions could be a huge differentiator. Most AR furniture apps just let you place things manually - having AI suggest arrangements based on room dimensions and flow patterns would save so much trial and error.\n\nOne question: how are you handling furniture catalog partnerships? The 'real brands' angle is compelling but I imagine onboarding retailers is non-trivial. Are you scraping product data or do you have direct integrations?",

So definitely some scaling issues or something.\n\nI really like this idea. Here's my feedback. I would totally use this app and just being completely honest to masturbate 😅. It allows me to scroll and see things that I want to see, but usually I don't want to switch between subreddits or create a separate account to track my likes of what I want to watch. So this is pretty nice. \n\nI would say the biggest thing for me is that you give us the option to search for subreddits and add a category that we can view. But there's no way to make sure that when it searches it only pulls back nsfw. So I would say if you can make an option to when you search. If you can toggle only NSFW subreddits that way I can make sure that it doesn't mix in regular stuff.\n\nBut definitely work on the scaling and loading of the site better because it definitely seems to have hit capacity",

If you can get it to be a timer for images but wait for a video to finish before automatically moveing on tha twould be even better\n\n3) Multi-image posts zoom in to the current image when you click on the > and < arrows, then when you zoom out you get the next image, it would be good if they just scrolled (on a timer if possible!)\n\n4) I can't \"save\" posts on the desktop, double-clicking doesn't seem to work and there's no heart icon to click on the content itself\n\n5) Keyboard navigation would be really cool, up/down to move to the next video/image, left/right to scroll between multi-images?\n\nIt's a great product, what I'd love to be able to do is leave this running on a spare monitor via a raspberry pi etc. so it's in the background while I do other things, and the auto-scroll would make that possible!",

      "text": "I am currently building a one-man app studio. I build SaaS apps for myself, for clients, and recently I've partnered with CEOs who have domain expertise but no tech team - I build it, they run it. That means I'm usually juggling 2-3 projects at once, and I don't have weeks to spend on each one.\n\nRight now I can go from a two-sentence app idea to a working, deployed (high-quality, tested, etc.) product in a few days.\n\nHere's how the system works.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n* I wrote a reusable playbook that lives in `~/.claude/` and travels with me across every project\n* New project starts with a heavy interview - AI asks me 15+ questions about the business, users, design, architecture, etc.\n* Answers get turned into structured docs (schema, architecture, business rules, design system)\n* A phased roadmap gets generated with checkboxes, and the AI works through it while I review every commit\n\n# The problem\n\nAI models like Opus-4.6 and Codex-5.3 are incredibly powerful, but they have blind spots. They don't know your domain, your schema, your business rules, or what they built yesterday. On simple projects this doesn't matter - they can one-shot a landing page or build a simple MVP, but on anything real, the quality deteriorates. They make assumptions, contradict earlier decisions, and build in the wrong direction - often forgetting important details. You can end up spending more time correcting the AI than you would've spent just writing the code yourself.\n\n# The fix: a portable documentation system\n\nI built a reusable playbook that lives outside any project (*of note, I build all of my web/SaaS apps using the same Rails/Inertia/React stack with the same libraries and tools)*:\n\n      ~/.claude/\n      ├── CLAUDE.md                    # Routes to everything below\n      ├── rails-playbook/\n      │   ├── README.md                # Conventions index\n      │   ├── auth.md                  # Authentication\n      │   ├── brand-interview.md       # 15-question project interview\n      │   ├── inertia-react.md         # Frontend setup\n      │   ├── solid-stack.md           # Queue, cache, cable\n      │   ├── stripe-payments.md       # Billing integration\n      │   ├── heroku-deploy.md         # Deployment\n      │   ├── analytics-seo.md         # Analytics & SEO\n      │   ├── email-verification.md    # Email flows\n      │   ├── settings-page.md         # User settings\n      │   ├── contact-page.md          # Contact forms\n      │   ├── legal-pages.md           # Terms, privacy\n      │   ├── logo-generation.md       # Brand assets\n      │   ├── env-template.md          # Environment variables\n      │   └── project-structure.md     # Directory layout\n    \n\nThe `CLAUDE.md` file is basically a table of contents. Claude reads it at the start of every session and knows where to find patterns for auth, payments, deployment, frontend architecture - whatever applies. Each project only pulls what it needs.\n\n# Interview first, code second\n\nWhen I start a new project, I spend a good chunk of time running an interview covering the business model, user types, core workflows, design preferences, edge cases, etc. The AI asks the questions and I answer in plain English.\n\nThose answers get turned into structured project docs folder:\n\n* `SCHEMA.md` \\- every table, column, relationship, index\n* `ARCHITECTURE.md` \\- technical decisions, service patterns, key flows\n* `BUSINESS_RULES.md` \\- domain logic, permissions, edge cases\n* `DESIGN.md` \\- colors, typography, component patterns\n* `CODE_QUALITY.md` \\- rules for clean, maintainable code\n* `TESTING.md` \\- test principles and conventions\n* `VIEWS.md` \\- UI specification, layouts, routes, role-based access\n* `INERTIA_RAILS.md` \\- frontend/backend integration patterns\n* `PROJECT_SETUP.md` \\- local dev and deployment\n* `ROADMAP.md` \\- phased implementation plan\n* `CLAUDE.md` \\- project-level AI instructions\n\nThese docs become the project's source of truth. Every time the AI starts a task, it reads them.\n\n# The roadmap engine\n\nThe roadmap is the holy source of truth. For my current project (a multi-tenant incident management system for property restoration), the roadmap has 9 phases and 153 checkboxes. Each phase builds on the last, adds tests, code reviews, etc:\n\n1. Foundation (firing up the app, auth, creating model, permissions)\n2. Properties (CRUD, assignments, scoping)\n3. Incidents core (creation, dashboard, status transitions)\n4. Communication (messages, contacts, notifications)\n5. Field operations (labor, equipment tracking)\n6. Documentation (notes, attachments, daily logs)\n7. Reporting\n8. E2E testing\n9. Polish & deploy\n\nThe AI works through the roadmap phase by phase. It checks off items as they're completed, adds notes about decisions made, and references which docs informed each choice. When I come back to a project after a few days, I don't have to remember where I left off - the roadmap tells me.\n\n# The hooks\n\nAfter every commit, a post-commit hook automatically runs against the changed files. It checks:\n\n* **Linters** \\- ESLint, TypeScript, RuboCop\n* **Design system** \\- no hardcoded colors, no raw `<button>` or `<input>` (use the component library), no border radius violations\n* **Architecture rules** \\- no N+1 database queries, no frontend date formatting, no hardcoded routes, no data aggregation on the client\n\n# I still review everything\n\nI review every commit. The system asks for permission before running commands, and I read the diffs before approving. I could bypass the permission prompts and let it run fully autonomous, but I want oversight.\n\nWhen something looks wrong, I catch it in review and course-correct. The playbook means those corrections are rare because the AI already knows the patterns, but they still happen. \n\n# What's next\n\nThe system keeps getting better as I add to it. Some things I'm exploring:\n\n* **Figma MCP** \\- plugging Figma directly into the workflow so the AI can reference actual design mockups instead of just written design tokens\n* **Image generation MCP** \\- using tools like Nano Banana to generate brand logos, marketing images, and SVGs during the brand interview phase instead of stubbing them out\n* **Better hooks** \\- The hooks don't catch as much as they should in terms of code that goes against the code quality docs. Not sure why, but these need improvement\n* **Faster service integrations**  \\- automating the boring setup steps like buying domains, wiring up error monitoring, and configuring API keys across environments\n\n# Results\n\nI've shipped four projects so far using this system and in 95% less time than it would've taken me 6 months ago. The code is consistent across projects because the playbook enforces the same patterns. New features land faster because the AI already knows the architecture instead of me re-explaining it every session.\n\nEvery project is a new learning experience and I'm continuously refining the playbooks and setup. Maybe one day I'll get it to one-shot complex apps with a one sentence prompt.\n\n---\nIf you're looking for a project to build and test your own system on, I have a whole database of ideas at https://cloneabledb.com/ - each idea comes with all the information you need to get started",

Here is an excerpt\n\n    ## Working Style\n    \n    - **Interview first** - Ask about project/requirements before coding\n    - **Never assume, always ask** - If something doesn't make sense for the project (e.g. adding OAuth when it wasn't discussed, setting up Stripe for a free app, adding features not requested), stop and ask. Don't add things \"just in case\" or because the playbook mentions them. Every piece of code should have a clear reason to exist for THIS project.\n    - **Be fully clear on the task** - Before starting work, make sure you understand exactly what's needed. If instructions are ambiguous or you're unsure whether something applies, ask rather than guessing. A quick question saves hours of unwanted work.\n    - **Only build what's requested** - Don't add extra integrations, services, or infrastructure beyond what the project actually needs. The playbook is a menu, not a checklist.\n    - **Use claude-mem** - Check memory before expensive searches\n    - **Use Context7** - Check docs before implementing libraries",

On larger/more complex projects, I think Codex-5.3 may produce better results than Claude... I'm just really locked into Claude with my setup and don't want to port all of that over to Codex!",

Each branch gets its own working directory so the AI's context stays isolated per feature and doesn't bleed across tasks. On Codex vs Claude, I've noticed Codex does tend to hold up better on larger context windows but Claude in plan mode produces cleaner architecture decisions upfront. Using both makes sense if you can afford the context cost switch.",

The biggest limitation of most AI chat interfaces is that everything gets flattened into markdown, which works fine for text but completely falls apart when you need to actually interact with the output. Tables you cant sort, charts you cant zoom, data you cant copy cleanly.\n\n  \nRendering actual UI components is the right direction. Curious about a few things:\n\n  \nHow do you handle the boundary between what the AI generates vs what gets rendered? Like if the model outputs something unexpected, does it degrade gracefully or does the whole response break?\n\n  \nAlso, is the component set fixed (charts, tables, etc) or can the AI decide to render arbitrary components? The former is way more stable but the latter is way more interesting.\n\n  \nNice work making it open source too. Thats the kind of project where community contributions could really expand the component library fast.",

However, LLMs have come a long way since then, and they're now capable of producing really good looking software amd websites. So, I thought I would love to introduce that to the normal conversation. To answer your questions so far the components it can use are fixed, they're basically the most basic fundamental components such as: Tables, charts, stepers, card, etc. it offer stability and so far it never broke, since the LLM output is basically json format and then the app translate that into UI components. And if the model output something that the app didn't understand then it will just get shown as text, so theoretically there's no way the response could break the app. In the future I am thinking about letting the AI generate the components arbitrarily, but as you said it will probably be less stable since it's prone to hallucinations.\n\nEdit: typo.",

Most of these are free to submit to, but people just don't bother. Easy backlinks.\n2. Comparison blog posts. Stuff like \"X vs Y vs Z\" where X and Y are established competitors. People constantly search \"\\[popular thing\\] alternative\" - so you write the post that answers that, and include yourself in the comparison. You're basically letting competitors do the demand generation and then capturing their search traffic.\n3. Seasonal content prepped early. I knew Valentine's Day would be big for my niche (couples games), so I had blog posts ready and ranking before the day, not during it.\n\nNone of this is quick, really. Took about 3 months of posting and working out how to get all my pages indexed with GSC and Bing. But now it's organic traffic from people actively searching for what I built, not random Redditors who, well... anyone in this game knows what im talking about.\n\nif you wanna check my site out its [https://artbitrator.com](https://artbitrator.com) \\- Multiplayer/Single player drawing game",
