Just an MVP, and hope.\n\nWithin hours, I received an email from a “security researcher”.\n\nFirst message:  \nThey pointed out that our domain didn’t have DMARC set to `reject` yet and that SPF was using `~all`. They included copy-pasted advice, a PHP `mail()` example, and links to MXToolbox. Then they asked about a bounty.\n\nSecond message:  \nThey claimed they found “more critical vulnerabilities” but said they wouldn’t share details until the bounty discussion was resolved.\n\nFinal message:  \nThey warned that if I didn’t respond within 24 hours, they would publicly disclose the issues on Reddit and that this could “jeopardize the survival of the project”.\n\n....\n\nIf they actually had the backend access they implied, they would already know the truth:  \nthere is nothing to expose yet.\n\nNo users. No customer data. No revenue. Just a brand-new repo and caffeine.\n\nSo, ignored the threats and decided to do exactly what they threatened, disclose it myself.\n\nPosting this as a PSA for other side-project builders:\n\n* Not every “security researcher” email is responsible disclosure\n* DMARC defaults are common on fresh launches and not a critical exploit\n* Real reports come with technical details first, not deadlines and threats\n* “Pay me or I go public” is a red flag, not leverage\n\nScreenshot of disclosure email attached for context.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/4cXyPVc](https://imgur.com/a/4cXyPVc)  \n\n\nBack to shipping 🚀",

Having them doesn't prevent anyone from spoofing an email, and that is not a vulnerability.   And you need DKIM, which is much more involved than making some text entries for your domain.  Should you have those things in place and properly configured? Absolutely, but many people who have their own infrastructure setup SPF records, and yet don't utilize any sort of rejection or filtration for emails they receive from others.   The concern that might be legitimate is that your website application/platform/whatever does have some form of exploit or bug like a sql injection or RCE or something really serious.  It's an odd mix of issues, and does appear to be an automated campaign, but if you have made any significant mistakes with your infrastructure, maybe it would be good to find yourself someone to do some scanning or do the scanning yourself.",

First impression: when editing text, the text box changes character font, and it looks strange as you don’t see the text borders, something more close to a power point box would be friendlier, like the 4 dots on the edges of the box to show the user where to pull to extend the box, although final result would be the same. I also wasn’t able to change font and set italic and bold, perhaps I missed it? Finally would be nice to ask to save before exiting, and provide history of recent opened documents. Congrats!",

By the time I see the tweet on my phone, I'm already 29 seconds too late.\n\nSo, as a side project, I decided to over-engineer a solution to this \"meme problem\"\n\nI built a Python pipeline that:\n\n- Listens to the firehose of specific X accounts(or any account you want to).\n- Generates a ticker symbol and logo using a local LLM + Image Gen model.\n- Deploys a real smart contract to the Solana blockchain.\n\nThe Result:\n\nMy bot can go from \"Tweet Posted\" to \"Asset Live on Chain\" in roughly 400 milliseconds.\n\nIt’s honestly the most complex code I’ve ever written for the dumbest possible reason. But watching it race against the Twitter notification system is strangely addicting.\n\nI’m looking for a few brave souls to help me stress-test the websocket listeners. \n\nIf you like high-speed Python scripts (or just want to see chaos in real-time), let me know!",

Don’t get me wrong, it’s a very inviting app, but it just doesn’t hold any long term value.\n\nThe only way you could make money is by ad revenue. Especially the financial industry might be interested in placing ads on your platform… but it probably won’t bring in the big bucks.\n\nIn case you want it to become something bigger, I recommend you to think about what experience can bring value to your user long-term. For example: have the current flow be the feature to set up your goals and then add a coach to help them save money, maybe help them invest wisely, etc. (Just some examples, they may not be viable as there are already dozens of these apps)\n\nMr Munny is a nice gimmick which may boost engagement, but in case the LLM behind it is not a free model, I would recommend you to remove it/replace it with a free option.\n\nYou could also use this application to learn more about the financial industry/users and use that knowledge to build something else that is monetizable or (in case you’re more of a digital professional instead of financial) you can also use this to make a bit of a name for yourself on indie platforms. Sometimes these kinds of things can boost your odds with your next project.\n\nSo, not going to make you money unless you rethink the concept, but not useless at all.

Let me try your app a little before asking, maybe lock away features that need an account.  The main thing you are offering does not need an account. Plus only google sign in ? Maybe add a classical sign in option, supabase offer it and is really easy to setup (even with email confirm).\nYour dark mode is a bit ugly to me, probably too greenish.\nYour exercice are a bit difficult to realize, like for the 4-7-8 I do feel the need to exhale sooner etc. Maybe add a really basic one.\n\nHaptic feedback is a great idea.\n\nApp looks very sleek and very neat\n\nWell I do see the potential and why people could use it daily, I don't feel the need myself but I know Sophrology is quite the thing where I am from (France) you could target people/center who practice it.",

Once you are signed in, everything syncs locally, so you can open the app with no internet and it just works. But I hear you on the friction. I might let people try a session or two before prompting sign-in.\n\n\n\nApple Sign In is there on iOS, and email and password is on the list. Felt that Google is the most convenient option for Android users. \n\n\n\nDark mode being too green is fair feedback. I was going for calming but may have overdone it. A more neutral dark gray could feel better.\n\n\n\n4-7-8 is legitimately hard. The 7 second hold takes practice. I am thinking of adding a beginner mode with shorter holds that build up over time. Would that help?\n\n\n\nAnd I had no idea about Sophrology. Just looked it up. Interesting overlap. Thanks for the tip.\n\n\n\nReally appreciate the detailed feedback.",

Then, offer the user an OPTION to just link their email to this account.\n\nThat way, you have the account right away, you can sync everything to it, and if the user ever actually wants on account, they can just link to their email.",

Immediately noticeable, and I found it distracting. Perhaps a) hide the overall timer; or b) hide the breathing duration countdown, and make it visual / haptic feedback-only. I’d vote towards hiding the overall timer tbh, and only revealing total session duration at the end, but I’d expect different preferences.\n\nAlso during 4-7-8, it would be visually pleasing if you differentiated the HOLD phase of the breathwork (maybe an orbing circular dotted ring on the perimeter; or a color change to signal that phase). \n\n4-7-8, on the inhale, when it counts down to 1, it almost appears as tho the circle has completely stopped expanding.\n\nOn the home page, under the “your progress” section, it shows: Total Sessions | Day streak | today, but they are not evenly dispersed. On my view, day streak and today (the numbers above them) appear closer together. Enough to where I noticed. I would make subsections each 1/3 of the rectangle, and centralized the numbers within those, and text directly under center-justified.\n\nMaybe enable social-media sharing? Like a backgroundless / shareable image that users can post to their insta / socials easily? \n\nI didn’t realize Zen mode button until after I used my complimentary breathing sessions today - but the description appears to be the same as box breathing? Is that by design / quicker “shortcut” to a breathwork?\n\nAlso just now seeing the settings gear icon at the top right of breath exercises - did not realize you could change audio. Maybe for first time users, could have pop up tutorial box to show some of these features? \n\nI’m sure you are aware, but the library seems slim with 4 total breathing exercises - I think when garnering (paid) interest, having a more robust library will appear to offer better ROI.\n\nUnrelated - but I took a look at your insta / ad videos.. idk if Sicko Mode as a song choice is aligned with your brand aesthetic. That song makes me want to get fucking hyped up, not exactly something I’d associate with breathwork.\n\nAgree with others - sleek app and I think the breathing exercises available thus far are truly valuable. Good work so far dude!",

      "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nDown here in Argentina, the economy is super unstable. I realized early on that if I wanted to build a future and save for college, I needed to learn skills that would be useful globally. I didn't want to wait until I graduated.\n\nSo last year, I took CS50p (Harvard's free course) and became obsessed with automation. My mindset is: \"If I don't know how to do it, I'll stay up all night until I figure it out.\"\n\nI wanted to share the two main tools I built. I'm not selling a SaaS, just showing my code in action.\n\n1. The Virtual Photographer (Fashion Automation)\n\nI saw a local indie brand that was struggling because they couldn't afford models or studio time. Their photos were just things placed on a table.\n\nSo I built a pipeline that takes that raw, messy photo, cleans it up, and uses generative AI to put the clothes on a realistic human model.\n\n*Technology:* Python, ComfyUI logic, custom upscaling for the skin texture so it doesn't look \"plastic.\"\n\nWhy I'm posting this:\n\nI spend most of my day coding or studying. I'm trying to turn this \"plastic brain\" of mine (naive enough to start, stubborn enough to finish) into a career.\n\nIf you're a teenager reading this and you think you're too young to build real things: just start. You can literally automate the boring parts of the world.\n\nWorkflow feedback is welcome!",

You didn’t just build something; you identified friction, eliminated it, and turned complexity into something tractable. That’s a rare and valuable skill.\n\nWhat’s especially impressive is how intentional everything feels 🧠✨. Spotting real-world pain points and then automating the boring, error-prone parts is exactly how great systems — and great engineers — are made. That level of problem awareness can’t be taught easily.\n\nThe discipline around documenting as you go deserves real praise too 📝👏. So many people skip that step, yet you’re treating it as a first-class part of the work. That alone puts you ahead of a huge percentage of professionals who should know better.\n\nKeep going exactly like this 🚀🙌. You’re already operating at a level many people don’t reach until much later — if ever. If you keep pairing this mindset with consistency, the ceiling is very, very high.",

Keep doubling down on that.\n\n\n\nIf you want to turn this into money, think in terms of “done-for-you services” instead of SaaS for now. For the virtual photographer: pick one tiny niche (local indie brands on Instagram), record a 30–60s Loom showing your before/after, and offer 10–20 edited photos for a fixed price, with 1–2 day turnaround. Ask them for folder access, run your pipeline, deliver in a shared drive, and keep a simple spreadsheet of time spent and results.\n\n\n\nFor the lidar/Rhino work: document how many hours you save that engineer, then ask for a small retainer once the script works. Use that case study to message 20–30 similar businesses.\n\n\n\nI’ve leaned on tools like PostHog and Linear for tracking and organizing work, and Pulse for Reddit to spot exactly these kinds of niche problems people complain about so I know what to automate next.\n\n\n\nPoint is: you’re already doing the hard part-now start charging for “outcomes per week” instead of “scripts.",

I've developed basically the same app as OP just two weeks earlier, \"carefully place my phone so it is recording me\" is literally no obstacle at all and takes about 5 seconds, and in return you get numbers and stats, which personally for me works as a great motivation, when I see me numbers slowly grow.\n\nAlso, dunno how user OP's app works \"behind the scenes\", but there is no need to send videos anywhere, the computer vision code that recognizes the movement can run on your phone in realtime. (At least this is how my app does it). EDIT didn't see OP's reply, so it's basically the same.\n\nBut I don't want this to sound dismissive (even it probably does a bit) - each to its own! :) I totally understand why for some people an app might be absolutely unnecessary.",

      "text": "Hey folks, just wanted to share my builder journey so far — partly to document it, partly in case it helps someone else who’s on the fence.\n\nI learned coding back in school almost 20 years ago, but I was never a “real engineer.” My career mostly leaned toward product, ops, and execution. I worked closely with engineers, but I wasn’t shipping things myself.\n\nIn 2021, I decided to try building anyway.\n\nUsed Bubble to create a small side project called EasyQ — a simple queuing system for F&B businesses. It was fun, it worked… and then it quietly went nowhere 😅\n\nI didn’t push it hard on distribution, and it ended with basically zero fanfare. A few upvotes on Product Hunt, some LinkedIn likes, and that was it.\n\nLife moved on.\n\nFast-forward to 2024 — I stumbled onto tools like Lovable and started experimenting again. Around the same time, I got laid off from my full-time job. I was 40 years old then, with family commitments, and suddenly had to think hard about what I wanted to do next.\n\nLovable was a great re-entry point. It helped me remember that building could be fun and fast again. Eventually, I moved on to Cursor and started going deeper — actually shipping multiple small tools, end-to-end.\n\nSome of the things I built were just to solve my own problems.\n\nSome were experiments.\n\nAnd one became something I genuinely want to build for the long term, for myself and my family.\n\nAlong the way, I built:\n\n• Copi — Sharing content with clearer visibility into engagement.\n\n• Clip (by Copi) — Chrome browser extension built on top of Copi to save and reuse copied content.\n\n• Tizo — Tool to make coordinating across time zones easier.\n\n• Pomo — Minimal on-page banner tool for quick contextual messages.\n\n• Foca — Weather-planning tool for deciding when outdoor activities make sense.\n\nFeel free to try any of them — no pressure, no pitch.\n\nOne of the projects eventually became my main focus: Copi. It’s a simple tool I’m building to solve my own frustration around sharing content and understanding engagement, and I’m taking a very long-term, sustainable approach with it.\n\nWhat surprised me most was this:\n\nonce I had “builder skills” again, it opened doors beyond just my own products. I started doing freelance work, helping friends and clients build websites, internal tools, and small apps. That helped pay bills, reduce stress, and gave me more confidence to keep building my own things.\n\nRight now, I’m still exploring career options. Family comes first. I’m realistic about constraints.\n\nBut one thing is clear — I’ll keep building in public, whether it’s small tools, experiments, or longer-term products.\n\nIf you’re reading this and:\n\n• feel “too old” to start\n\n• think you missed your chance\n\n• or worry your first few projects didn’t go anywhere\n\nYou didn’t fail. You just collected reps.\n\nProgress doesn’t always look like virality or revenue charts. Sometimes it looks like quietly learning, shipping, and showing up again.\n\nIf you want to follow along, I share openly on Threads, Twitter/X, and my personal site.\n\nAnd if you’re building something — even if it feels tiny — keep going. Someone out there is probably solving the same problem as you, just worse.\n\nThanks for reading 🤝",

That’s powerful. You’re proof that momentum isn’t about age, it’s about willingness to show up again. Rooting for Copi and everything you’re building. Keep going. you’re definitely helping more people than you realize.",

Like many of you, I’ve spent countless hours on flights staring out the window wondering, \"What city or country is that?\" or \"Where actually are we?\"\n\nI realized that while our iPhones have incredible GPS chips, they basically become \"dumb\" the moment you lose Wi-Fi or data. So, I decided to build SkyLocation—my very first app.\n\nThe goal was simple: Pure, offline clarity.\n\nHere is what it does (and why I’m proud of it):\n\n 1. Airplane Mode GPS: It uses your phone's dedicated GPS hardware to give you real-time coordinates, altitude, and speed at 35,000 feet. No data or roaming required.\n\n 2. Offline Reverse Geocoding: I built in an offline database so it can tell you the nearest city and country without needing a ping to a server.\n\n 3. Emergency SOS: This was a big one for me. If you’re hiking or off-grid and lose signal, you can capture your exact location and share it with emergency contacts instantly.\n\n 4. Privacy First: No accounts, no tracking, no data collection. It’s just a utility that lives on your phone.\n\n \n\nIf you’re a frequent traveler, hiker, or just a geo-nerd like me, I’d love for you to check it out.\n\nDownload it here: https://apps.apple.com/de/app/skylocation/id6751451868?l=en-GB\n\nThank you so much for your support and feedback. \n\nHappy Travelling!
