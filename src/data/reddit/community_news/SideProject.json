Just an MVP, and hope.\n\nWithin hours, I received an email from a “security researcher”.\n\nFirst message:  \nThey pointed out that our domain didn’t have DMARC set to `reject` yet and that SPF was using `~all`. They included copy-pasted advice, a PHP `mail()` example, and links to MXToolbox. Then they asked about a bounty.\n\nSecond message:  \nThey claimed they found “more critical vulnerabilities” but said they wouldn’t share details until the bounty discussion was resolved.\n\nFinal message:  \nThey warned that if I didn’t respond within 24 hours, they would publicly disclose the issues on Reddit and that this could “jeopardize the survival of the project”.\n\n....\n\nIf they actually had the backend access they implied, they would already know the truth:  \nthere is nothing to expose yet.\n\nNo users. No customer data. No revenue. Just a brand-new repo and caffeine.\n\nSo, ignored the threats and decided to do exactly what they threatened, disclose it myself.\n\nPosting this as a PSA for other side-project builders:\n\n* Not every “security researcher” email is responsible disclosure\n* DMARC defaults are common on fresh launches and not a critical exploit\n* Real reports come with technical details first, not deadlines and threats\n* “Pay me or I go public” is a red flag, not leverage\n\nScreenshot of disclosure email attached for context.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/4cXyPVc](https://imgur.com/a/4cXyPVc)  \n\n\nBack to shipping 🚀",

Having them doesn't prevent anyone from spoofing an email, and that is not a vulnerability.   And you need DKIM, which is much more involved than making some text entries for your domain.  Should you have those things in place and properly configured? Absolutely, but many people who have their own infrastructure setup SPF records, and yet don't utilize any sort of rejection or filtration for emails they receive from others.   The concern that might be legitimate is that your website application/platform/whatever does have some form of exploit or bug like a sql injection or RCE or something really serious.  It's an odd mix of issues, and does appear to be an automated campaign, but if you have made any significant mistakes with your infrastructure, maybe it would be good to find yourself someone to do some scanning or do the scanning yourself.",

First impression: when editing text, the text box changes character font, and it looks strange as you don’t see the text borders, something more close to a power point box would be friendlier, like the 4 dots on the edges of the box to show the user where to pull to extend the box, although final result would be the same. I also wasn’t able to change font and set italic and bold, perhaps I missed it? Finally would be nice to ask to save before exiting, and provide history of recent opened documents. Congrats!",

By the time I see the tweet on my phone, I'm already 29 seconds too late.\n\nSo, as a side project, I decided to over-engineer a solution to this \"meme problem\"\n\nI built a Python pipeline that:\n\n- Listens to the firehose of specific X accounts(or any account you want to).\n- Generates a ticker symbol and logo using a local LLM + Image Gen model.\n- Deploys a real smart contract to the Solana blockchain.\n\nThe Result:\n\nMy bot can go from \"Tweet Posted\" to \"Asset Live on Chain\" in roughly 400 milliseconds.\n\nIt’s honestly the most complex code I’ve ever written for the dumbest possible reason. But watching it race against the Twitter notification system is strangely addicting.\n\nI’m looking for a few brave souls to help me stress-test the websocket listeners. \n\nIf you like high-speed Python scripts (or just want to see chaos in real-time), let me know!",

Let me try your app a little before asking, maybe lock away features that need an account.  The main thing you are offering does not need an account. Plus only google sign in ? Maybe add a classical sign in option, supabase offer it and is really easy to setup (even with email confirm).\nYour dark mode is a bit ugly to me, probably too greenish.\nYour exercice are a bit difficult to realize, like for the 4-7-8 I do feel the need to exhale sooner etc. Maybe add a really basic one.\n\nHaptic feedback is a great idea.\n\nApp looks very sleek and very neat\n\nWell I do see the potential and why people could use it daily, I don't feel the need myself but I know Sophrology is quite the thing where I am from (France) you could target people/center who practice it.",

Once you are signed in, everything syncs locally, so you can open the app with no internet and it just works. But I hear you on the friction. I might let people try a session or two before prompting sign-in.\n\n\n\nApple Sign In is there on iOS, and email and password is on the list. Felt that Google is the most convenient option for Android users. \n\n\n\nDark mode being too green is fair feedback. I was going for calming but may have overdone it. A more neutral dark gray could feel better.\n\n\n\n4-7-8 is legitimately hard. The 7 second hold takes practice. I am thinking of adding a beginner mode with shorter holds that build up over time. Would that help?\n\n\n\nAnd I had no idea about Sophrology. Just looked it up. Interesting overlap. Thanks for the tip.\n\n\n\nReally appreciate the detailed feedback.",

          "text": "During box breathing exercise - the dot navigating around the square seems glitchy.. it doesn’t move in smooth motion (not sure if intentional?); id prefer it move smoothly.\n\n4-7-8 breathing - after the first round, the centralized timer (showing inhale/hold/exhale durations) become desynchronized with the overall session timer in the bottom left. Immediately noticeable, and I found it distracting. Perhaps a) hide the overall timer; or b) hide the breathing duration countdown, and make it visual / haptic feedback-only. I’d vote towards hiding the overall timer tbh, and only revealing total session duration at the end, but I’d expect different preferences.\n\nAlso during 4-7-8, it would be visually pleasing if you differentiated the HOLD phase of the breathwork (maybe an orbing circular dotted ring on the perimeter; or a color change to signal that phase). \n\n4-7-8, on the inhale, when it counts down to 1, it almost appears as tho the circle has completely stopped expanding.\n\nOn the home page, under the “your progress” section, it shows: Total Sessions | Day streak | today, but they are not evenly dispersed. On my view, day streak and today (the numbers above them) appear closer together. Enough to where I noticed. I would make subsections each 1/3 of the rectangle, and centralized the numbers within those, and text directly under center-justified.\n\nMaybe enable social-media sharing? Like a backgroundless / shareable image that users can post to their insta / socials easily? \n\nI didn’t realize Zen mode button until after I used my complimentary breathing sessions today - but the description appears to be the same as box breathing? Is that by design / quicker “shortcut” to a breathwork?\n\nAlso just now seeing the settings gear icon at the top right of breath exercises - did not realize you could change audio. Maybe for first time users, could have pop up tutorial box to show some of these features? \n\nI’m sure you are aware, but the library seems slim with 4 total breathing exercises - I think when garnering (paid) interest, having a more robust library will appear to offer better ROI.\n\nUnrelated - but I took a look at your insta / ad videos.. idk if Sicko Mode as a song choice is aligned with your brand aesthetic. That song makes me want to get fucking hyped up, not exactly something I’d associate with breathwork.\n\nAgree with others - sleek app and I think the breathing exercises available thus far are truly valuable. Good work so far dude!",

We'll definitely work on that. \n\n3) yes, the Zen mode is supposed to be a shortcut to box breathing. \n\n4) 100% I've just realized that there are many small things which are not being used which are hidden will be included in onboarding. \n\n5) I have submitted a new version with 4 more techniques. Should be rolling out in the next 24 hours.\n\n6) Hahaha i am trying to optimize content based on platform and thought a quick edit will work for Insta.

If you find work, you leave.\n\nThe idea: Craigslist for developer availability. No resumes, no applications, no LinkedIn noise.\n\nBuilt in a day with Next.js, Supabase, Vercel. Just shipped \"last active\" so stale profiles sink to the bottom.\n\nLooking for feedback - especially from anyone who's hired devs before. Would you actually browse this?\n\nhttps://available.dev",

(At least this is how my app does it). EDIT didn't see OP's reply, so it's basically the same.\n\nBut I don't want this to sound dismissive (even it probably does a bit) - each to its own! :) I totally understand why for some people an app might be absolutely unnecessary.",

It’s frustrating and time-consuming.\n\nFor those who don’t know launch directories are websites where new products and startups get listed and showcased to an audience actively looking for new tools and solutions. They’re like curated marketplaces or hubs for discovery, not just random link dumps.\n\nIt’s annoying to find a good list, so I finally sat down and built a proper list of launch directories: sites like Product Hunt, BetaList, StartupBase, etc. Ended up with 82 legit ones.\n\nI also added a way to sort them by DR (Domain Rating) basically a metric (from tools like Ahrefs) that estimates how strong a website’s backlink profile is. Higher DR usually means the site has more authority and might pass more SEO value or get more organic traffic.\n\nI turned it into a simple site: [launchdirectories.com](http://launchdirectories.com/)\n\nNo fluff, no paywall, no signups just the list I wish I had every time I launch something.\n\nThought it might help others here too.",

I’d also tag each directory by audience (makers, SMBs, enterprises) and by intent (browse vs. launch-focused) so you’re not wasting time on the wrong crowd.\n\n\n\nFor tracking, a simple sheet with UTMs, status, and conversions is enough to see which sites drive actual signups instead of just vanity traffic. I’ve used Product Hunt and Indie Hackers for launches, plus Futurepedia for SaaS discovery, and lately Pulse for Reddit to catch threads where people are literally asking for tools like mine so I can reply in context.\n\n\n\nMain thing: treat this list like a system you iterate on, not a one-time promotion blast.",

      "text": "Hey folks, just wanted to share my builder journey so far — partly to document it, partly in case it helps someone else who’s on the fence.\n\nI learned coding back in school almost 20 years ago, but I was never a “real engineer.” My career mostly leaned toward product, ops, and execution. I worked closely with engineers, but I wasn’t shipping things myself.\n\nIn 2021, I decided to try building anyway.\n\nUsed Bubble to create a small side project called EasyQ — a simple queuing system for F&B businesses. It was fun, it worked… and then it quietly went nowhere 😅\n\nI didn’t push it hard on distribution, and it ended with basically zero fanfare. A few upvotes on Product Hunt, some LinkedIn likes, and that was it.\n\nLife moved on.\n\nFast-forward to 2024 — I stumbled onto tools like Lovable and started experimenting again. Around the same time, I got laid off from my full-time job. I was 40 years old then, with family commitments, and suddenly had to think hard about what I wanted to do next.\n\nLovable was a great re-entry point. It helped me remember that building could be fun and fast again. Eventually, I moved on to Cursor and started going deeper — actually shipping multiple small tools, end-to-end.\n\nSome of the things I built were just to solve my own problems.\n\nSome were experiments.\n\nAnd one became something I genuinely want to build for the long term, for myself and my family.\n\nAlong the way, I built:\n\n• Copi — Sharing content with clearer visibility into engagement.\n\n• Clip (by Copi) — Chrome browser extension built on top of Copi to save and reuse copied content.\n\n• Tizo — Tool to make coordinating across time zones easier.\n\n• Pomo — Minimal on-page banner tool for quick contextual messages.\n\n• Foca — Weather-planning tool for deciding when outdoor activities make sense.\n\nFeel free to try any of them — no pressure, no pitch.\n\nOne of the projects eventually became my main focus: Copi. It’s a simple tool I’m building to solve my own frustration around sharing content and understanding engagement, and I’m taking a very long-term, sustainable approach with it.\n\nWhat surprised me most was this:\n\nonce I had “builder skills” again, it opened doors beyond just my own products. I started doing freelance work, helping friends and clients build websites, internal tools, and small apps. That helped pay bills, reduce stress, and gave me more confidence to keep building my own things.\n\nRight now, I’m still exploring career options. Family comes first. I’m realistic about constraints.\n\nBut one thing is clear — I’ll keep building in public, whether it’s small tools, experiments, or longer-term products.\n\nIf you’re reading this and:\n\n• feel “too old” to start\n\n• think you missed your chance\n\n• or worry your first few projects didn’t go anywhere\n\nYou didn’t fail. You just collected reps.\n\nProgress doesn’t always look like virality or revenue charts. Sometimes it looks like quietly learning, shipping, and showing up again.\n\nIf you want to follow along, I share openly on Threads, Twitter/X, and my personal site.\n\nAnd if you’re building something — even if it feels tiny — keep going. Someone out there is probably solving the same problem as you, just worse.\n\nThanks for reading 🤝",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share something I’ve been working on. Like many of you, I’ve spent countless hours on flights staring out the window wondering, \"What city or country is that?\" or \"Where actually are we?\"\n\nI realized that while our iPhones have incredible GPS chips, they basically become \"dumb\" the moment you lose Wi-Fi or data. So, I decided to build SkyLocation—my very first app.\n\nThe goal was simple: Pure, offline clarity.\n\nHere is what it does (and why I’m proud of it):\n\n 1. Airplane Mode GPS: It uses your phone's dedicated GPS hardware to give you real-time coordinates, altitude, and speed at 35,000 feet. No data or roaming required.\n\n 2. Offline Reverse Geocoding: I built in an offline database so it can tell you the nearest city and country without needing a ping to a server.\n\n 3. Emergency SOS: This was a big one for me. If you’re hiking or off-grid and lose signal, you can capture your exact location and share it with emergency contacts instantly.\n\n 4. Privacy First: No accounts, no tracking, no data collection. It’s just a utility that lives on your phone.\n\n \n\nIf you’re a frequent traveler, hiker, or just a geo-nerd like me, I’d love for you to check it out.\n\nDownload it here: https://apps.apple.com/de/app/skylocation/id6751451868?l=en-GB\n\nThank you so much for your support and feedback. \n\nHappy Travelling!

This has been a passion project for me and I'm not seeking financial gain from it.\n\nIf you ever start on an article like Line dancing and end up on the article about the Hubble Space Telescope, RabbiMap might be for you :)\n\n**You can look up any website, PDF, browse the internet, draw connections, add post-it nodes and save your boards!**\n\nIf you'd like to get updates about the project, you can join the community [https://www.reddit.com/r/rabbitmap](https://www.reddit.com/r/rabbitmap)",

              "text": "Thanks for taking the time to dig in, I really appreciate the thoughtful questions. This has genuinely been a labor of love.\n\n**On architecture:**  \nUnder the hood we run across AWS, GCP, and Cloudflare. That choice is very intentional. I spent several years as an SRE at Cloudflare, so I’m leaning on primitives I know scale well and stay boring under load.\n\n**On what we’re tapping into:**  \nRight now we integrate with AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, Vercel, GitHub, Lovable, and Base44. The goal isn’t “more integrations for the sake of it,” it’s to start reconstructing the real distributed system most companies actually run. A little infra in AWS, some in GCP after price shopping, deployments on Vercel, code in GitHub, ownership spread across teams. Those connections are where most of the context loss happens.\n\nTelemetry is coming next, followed by deeper knowledge and change understanding. But we’re being deliberate about the order.\n\n**On ‘who watches the watchers’:**  \nYou’re absolutely right, this is where most contextual observability tools fall apart. You end up babysitting the system that was supposed to help you debug.\n\nBecause of my SRE background, I’m pretty opinionated here. I am designing OpsCompanion to be a *doorway*, not a replacement. If you need metadata on an EC2 instance, you can see it in OpsCompanion and jump straight to the underlying system. We never want to trap people behind abstractions or hide the source of truth.\n\nWhere OpsCompanion aims to add value isn’t “cross-correlation” in the dashboard sense. It’s deriving operational truth across systems. GitHub + cloud + deployment data lets us compute things like blast radius, ownership, and intent, things you can’t see in any single tool today and is mainly trapped in a single person's head regardless of the size of the company. That context is optional, transparent, and never blocks access to the underlying systems.\n\nVisually, we’re obsessive about this too. The UI is designed to surface relationships without becoming visual noise or another dashboard you fight with.\n\n**On the ‘relatable story’ comment:**  \nFair pushback. I’m not trying to sell a vibe. The story is there to explain *why* the tech exists, not to replace the tech itself. At the end of the day, this is a system built by someone who has been on call and wants fewer sharp edges in Day 2 operations.\n\nIf I’m missing the spirit of your question here, I would honestly love to understand it better. Always happy to go deeper on the internals or hear product feedback, especially from someone who has built in the space before.",
