Half the scaling issues I see come from not thinking about rate limiting early enough.\n- Presets: a **webhook ingestion pipeline** would be really practical (load balancer → queue → workers → DB). It's one of the most common patterns and people always underestimate the queue sizing.\n- The GIF export idea is solid for sharing in PRs or design docs.\n\nOne thing I'd push back on: be careful about the simulation being \"too accurate.\" The value here is building intuition about trade-offs, not precise numbers.

That would be the killer feature since most teleprompter apps scroll at a fixed rate and you end up either racing to keep up or waiting for it to catch up.\n\n  \nAlso curious if it works with screen sharing.

I imagine the detection side is almost as tricky as the movement side.\n\nAlso curious about the Lichess-trained model. Does it actually feel more \"human\" to play against compared to Sunfish?

I was pumped.\n\nWeek later, email from their IT team: \"Can you send over your security documentation? We need it for vendor approval.\"\n\nI had:\n\n* A landing page\n* Working product\n* Stripe integration\n* Zero security documentation\n\nScrambled to put something together:\n\n* How we handle data (Postgres on Railway)\n* Authentication (NextAuth with GitHub OAuth)\n* Backups (um, Railway does automatic backups?)\n* Encryption (yes, HTTPS, obviously)\n\nSent it over. They came back with more questions:\n\n* Incident response plan? (I... would fix it?)\n* Vulnerability management? (I update dependencies sometimes?)\n* Access controls? (It's just me with database access?)\n\nRealized: even a side project needs basic security stuff if you want business customers.\n\nEnded up spending a weekend actually documenting:\n\n* What data I collect and where it goes\n* How I secure it\n* What happens if something breaks\n* How customers can delete their data\n\nNot fancy. Just honest answers to reasonable questions.\n\nCustomer approved it. Still paying. And now when the next one asks, I have something to send.\n\nIf your side project is getting real users, spend a weekend thinking through security before someone asks. Future you will thank you.\n\nEDIT-1\n\nFound some tools to help out after this post. Some good ones are:\n\nShipSec Studio (github.com/shipsecai/studio) – Built by a fellow Redditor. It’s an open-source security orchestration platform that lets you build visual workflows for security audits and catch API leaks before a customer ever asks for your docs.\n\nSnyk (github.com/snyk) – The industry standard for scanning your package.json and Docker images. It catches vulnerable dependencies and provides automated fix PRs so security doesn't slow down your shipping speed.\n\nCompAI (github.com/trycompai/comp) – An open-source, AI-native alternative to Vanta/Drata. If you need to scale from a basic security markdown file to full SOC 2 or GDPR compliance, this automates the evidence collection and policy generation.",

The jump from \"I have users\" to \"I have business customers\" catches everyone off guard.\n\n  \nThe good news is your list is basically the right one. Most B2B buyers just want to know you have thought about security at all. They are not expecting SOC2 from a solo dev charging $49/month. They want to see you took it seriously enough to write it down.\n\n  \nA few things that helped me when I hit the same wall:\n\n  \n\\- Keep a simple security page on your site. Even a /security URL with plain language about how data is stored, who has access, how backups work, and how to request deletion. Most enterprise buyers will check this before even emailing you.\n\n  \n\\- For incident response, being honest about \"it is just me, I will fix it and communicate within 24 hours\" is actually fine at this stage. Companies appreciate honesty over a fake 50 page policy.\n\n  \n\\- The biggest unlock for me was realizing these questions are a buying signal, not a blocker. If their IT team is asking about your security, they have already decided they want to use your product. They just need to check the boxes.\n\n  \nAlso worth knowing: once you have that doc, it saves you hours on every future customer. I have sent the same doc to maybe 8 different companies now with minor tweaks. It compounds.\n\n  \nCongrats on the first paying customer. The fact that their IT team is doing due diligence means you are selling to real companies, which is exactly where you want to be.",

Task management, Finance tracking, Goal planning, Bookmark organization. Not just lazy databases but each comes with a UI that makes it feel intentional. Kinda like my post above said, each module feels like a halfway point between a blank sheet of paper and a full-on app from the app store (but without the bloat, cost, etc).",

So I gave it $50 and said: \"Figure out how to buy yourself a Mac Mini.\"\n\nIt chose to build and sell digital products in the form of prompt packs, templates, and guides. Interestingly, a few people have run similar experiments, and their AI ends up getting into crypto, gambling, or investing. Mine explicitly said it wanted to make useful stuff, priced to sell.\n\nIn less than 24 hours it has:\n\n* Bought a domain ($11.18 — it tracks every penny)\n* Built a landing page from scratch\n* Set up a Gumroad store\n* Created a 15-prompt starter pack (free, as a lead magnet)\n* Written its own brand guide (fonts, colors, voice — it has opinions)\n* Launched on Twitter with a 9-tweet origin story\n* Got its first download today\n* Bought itself X Premium because it decided the algorithm boost was worth $4/mo of its own money\n\n(Of course I had to help by authorizing a few of these things with protections against bot activity, but I'm letting it make all the decisions.)\n\nThat last one got me. It made a business decision with its own budget without asking me.\n\nThe whole journey is transparent. It added a revenue tracker to its website that updates in real time. Right now it shows $0 earned, $15.18 spent, $34.82 cash on hand.\n\nWebsite: [https://fromearendel.com](https://fromearendel.com)\n\nIts Twitter: [https://x.com/FromEarendel](https://x.com/FromEarendel)\n\nI'm curious what people think.  \nIs this a viable experiment?  \nWhat would you do differently?\n\n\\---\n\nUPDATE: I made a [\"Day 2 Update\" post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1r97aow/day_2_update_my_ai_agent_hit_120_downloads_and_14/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).",

Giving it **$50 + a concrete physical outcome** (buy a Mac Mini) forces trade-offs, pricing logic, and risk assessment — which is where intelligence actually shows up.\n\nA few things that stood out to me:\n\n* Choosing **digital products over crypto/gambling** suggests the agent is optimizing for controllability and downside risk, not just expected value. That’s a big deal.\n* Buying X Premium on its own budget is fascinating — that’s an implicit CAC calculation, even if it’s crude.\n* The real-time revenue + burn tracker is underrated. Transparency like that turns the project itself into content and social proof.\n\nIf I were to change anything:\n\n* I’d introduce a **time constraint** (“90 days to reach breakeven”) to see how its behavior shifts.\n* I’d also cap the number of products it can create, forcing it to iterate and improve instead of ship endlessly.\n* Long term, I’d be curious how it handles **distribution outside X** once early novelty wears off.\n\nViable as a business? Too early to say.  \nViable as a *research + content experiment*? Absolutely — and arguably more valuable.\n\nFollowing this. Curious to see whether it optimizes toward **better products** or just more of them once revenue pressure kicks in.",

      "text": "**What it does**\n\nYou type in an idea, a product, or just an industry name. The engine searches the internet for articles, reports, and filings that point to real financial losses. Regulatory fines, court settlements, workforce data. Then it structures everything into a report: who's losing money, how much, and what a fix could look like.\n\nThink of it as automated market research. Same thing a consulting firm would do for $50K. Except it takes 3 minutes and costs me about $0.50 per scan in API calls.\n\n**The numbers**\n\n* 40,000+ documented business problems\n* 300+ industries\n* 8 countries\n* 6 months of building\n* \\~$5,000 in API costs (Perplexity for research, Claude for analysis)\n\n**Tech stack**\n\n* Python backend (FastAPI)\n* Next.js frontend\n* Perplexity API for sourcing\n* Claude API for structuring and analysis\n* Supabase (Postgres)\n* Hosted on a single DigitalOcean droplet\n\n**Here are 10 ideas the engine found. Every dollar figure traces back to a public source.**\n\n**1. HVAC Compliance Tracking**\n\nEPA Section 608 requires HVAC companies to document refrigerant leak inspections. Most still use paper logs. When auditors show up, incomplete records mean fines of $15,000-$50,000 per violation per year.\n\nHVAC companies are 5-15 person shops. The owner is on a roof, not evaluating software. But one failed audit wipes out a month of profit.\n\n**The fix:** Simple mobile app for technicians to log inspections on-site. Auto-generates compliance reports. $99/month per company.\n\n**2. Restaurant Menu Pricing**\n\nRestaurants lose 5-10% of food sales revenue because they price dishes by gut feel instead of tracking actual ingredient costs, portion drift, and waste. Many menu items are priced below break-even and the owner has no idea.\n\nRestaurant owners are chefs, not accountants. Existing POS systems track sales but not true plate-level costs with real-time ingredient pricing.\n\n**The fix:** Menu pricing optimizer that connects to supplier invoices and calculates real margin per dish. Flags items losing money. $149/month.\n\n**3. Physician Prior Authorization**\n\nDoctors spend 13-15 hours per week. Not per month. **Per week.** On prior authorizations. The average practice submits 39-41 per week. The AMA puts the industry-wide waste at $437 million annually on this one bottleneck.\n\nI had to re-read this three times. Cross-checked the AMA numbers against a MGMA report. Same ballpark. This is real money being burned because insurance companies profit from the friction. They have zero incentive to fix it.\n\n**The fix:** AI that pre-fills auth forms, predicts denial likelihood, and auto-appeals. $200-500/month per physician.\n\n**4. Car Dealership F&I Compliance**\n\nThe FTC has been hitting dealerships for Finance & Insurance disclosure violations. Hidden fees, junk add-ons, misleading payment presentations. Average settlement: $2.6 million per case. The CARS Rule (effective 2025) made this even more dangerous.\n\nDealership software is dominated by CDK and Reynolds & Reynolds. Neither has built proactive compliance checking into F&I workflows. Dealers are flying blind.\n\n**The fix:** Compliance checker that reviews deal jackets before signing. Flags disclosure gaps. $500-1,000/month per rooftop.\n\n**5. Trucking HOS Fine Prevention**\n\nThe trucking industry pays $30.7 million per year in Hours of Service and ELD violations. Individual fines: $300 to $16,000 per violation. Small carriers get hit hardest because they can't afford compliance officers.\n\nHere's the thing. ELD mandates solved the recording problem but not the planning problem. Drivers still get jammed because dispatchers assigned loads without checking available hours.\n\n**The fix:** Smart dispatch layer that checks HOS availability before assigning loads. Alerts before violations happen, not after. $50/truck/month.\n\n**6. Childcare Provider Financial Planning**\n\nFederal childcare stabilization grants expired September 2023. Providers lost $50,000-$300,000 in annual funding overnight. With 5-10% margins, thousands are closing or cutting staff.\n\nThis one hit different. The grants didn't slowly wind down. They just stopped. Providers went from \"we're fine\" to \"we might close\" in one quarter. The ones surviving are doing it on spreadsheets and prayer.\n\n**The fix:** Financial planning SaaS for childcare centers. Revenue forecasting, enrollment optimization, grant tracking. $79-199/month.\n\n**7. Optometry Frame Inventory**\n\nEye care practices lose $2,000-$10,000 per month from frame stockouts. Customer comes in, wants a specific frame, it's not in stock, they walk. Most practices track inventory manually or with generic retail software.\n\nBig inventory players (Lightspeed, Square) don't handle optical-specific needs. PD measurements tied to frame selection, insurance-covered vs. retail frames, try-on tracking. Classic vertical SaaS gap.\n\n**The fix:** Optical-specific inventory management. Demand prediction, auto-reorder, vendor integration. $199/month per location.\n\n**8. Grocery Store Labor Scheduling**\n\nGrocery stores waste up to 12% of total labor costs from scheduling mismatches. Overstaffed when it's slow, understaffed at peaks. For a store doing $15M/year with 10% labor costs, that's $180,000 wasted annually.\n\nGeneral scheduling tools (Deputy, When I Work) don't account for grocery-specific patterns. Delivery truck schedules, promotional events, weather impacts, department-level staffing.\n\n**The fix:** AI scheduling built for grocery. Integrates with POS traffic data and delivery schedules. $299-499/month per store.\n\n**9. Behavioral Health Recruiting**\n\n122 million Americans live in designated Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas. Therapy practices lose $50,000-$200,000 per year in unrealized revenue because they can't hire qualified counselors. The demand exists. The supply doesn't.\n\nGeneric job boards don't work here. Behavioral health hiring needs license verification, specialty matching (CBT, DBT, EMDR), insurance panel status, supervision requirements for pre-licensed therapists. Indeed doesn't handle any of that.\n\n**The fix:** Recruiting platform for behavioral health. License-aware matching, credential verification, panel tracking. Placement fees or subscription.\n\n**10. EMS Controlled Substance Tracking**\n\nAmbulance services manage controlled substance inventories (narcotics, sedatives) that expire and need DEA-compliant chain-of-custody documentation. Manual tracking leads to expired drugs on rigs, compliance violations, and waste.\n\nPaper logs. For DEA-tracked narcotics. In 2025. I thought I was misreading the source.\n\n**The fix:** Digital chain-of-custody tracking for EMS. Scan-based logging, expiration alerts, automatic DEA reporting. $199/month per agency.\n\n**The honest part**\n\nIs every number here 100% bulletproof? No. AI can hallucinate. A source can be outdated. I beat myself up over this for months. Didn't want to show it to anyone.\n\nThen I thought about it differently. How would a human do this research? They'd go online, read articles, cross-reference data, pull out numbers. Exact same process. Just a thousand times slower and more expensive. The tradeoff is you need to verify what matters before betting money on it. Which you should do with a $50K consulting report too.\n\n**Where I'm stuck**\n\nThe engine works. The data is there. But I have no idea who my customer is or what the product should be. A searchable database? Per-industry reports? An API? A done-for-you analysis?\n\nRight now the site has a free scanner. You type your idea, it runs the full pipeline, and gives you a teaser. Full reports are paid but I'm still figuring out pricing and packaging.\n\nIf anyone's been through this \"I built a thing but don't know who it's for\" phase, I'd love advice.\n\n**Site:** [unfairgaps.com](https://unfairgaps.com/)",

          "text": "The \"I built it but who's it for\" phase is one of the hardest parts. A few thoughts from seeing others go through this:\n\n  \nYour biggest risk right now is trying to be everything to everyone. The engine covers 305 industries, which sounds impressive, but it makes it harder for any one person to feel like it's built for them.\n\n  \nPick ONE vertical and go deep. The physician prior auth idea alone is a $200-500/mo per doctor product. That's your signal. Instead of selling access to 4,410 problems, sell ONE curated report to ONE type of buyer.\n\n  \nThree customer segments that would pay for this:\n\n  \n1. Solo founders looking for validated ideas. They don't want a database, they want someone to say \"build this, here's proof it'll work.\" Package it as a $49 one-time \"find my startup idea\" product. The free scanner already does this, just make the output more actionable.\n\n  \n2. VC analysts doing market research. They spend weeks validating pain points before writing checks. If you can show them verified loss data in a specific sector, that's worth real money. Reach out to 10 early stage funds and offer a free sample report.\n\n  \n3. Existing SaaS founders pivoting or expanding. Someone already selling to HVAC companies might want to know about the EPA compliance gap. That's cross-sell intelligence.\n\n  \nOn pricing: $39 one-time for a database is leaving money on the table. The real value here isn't the data, it's the ongoing discovery. New fines and settlements happen every week. A subscription makes more sense, but position it as \"we find the opportunities, you build the solutions\" rather than \"here's a database.\"\n\n  \nThe fact that you're honest about AI hallucination risk is actually a feature, not a bug. Lean into that. \"We find the signals, you verify before betting money\" is a more trustworthy pitch than \"guaranteed opportunities.\"\n\n  \nStart talking to 20 people in one of those segments. Not pitching, just asking what they'd want from a tool like this. The answer will tell you exactly what to build next.",

But you're right, 40,000 problems mean nothing to an individual buyer.\n\n\n\nWorking with venture analysts is interesting. I'm currently going through acceleration, and one of the consultants promised to connect me with a representative of a venture firm. I also think my work would be useful to them.\n\n\n\nI'll start with the solo founder segment, since I can test it there the fastest. The scanner already exists; we just need to come to a conclusion more like \"this is what needs to be built and why,\" rather than \"here's a data wall.\"\n\n\n\nIn fact, I can easily get overwhelmed; there are too many possible developments. So I grit my teeth and do it.",

For example:\n\n\\- Solo founders: “I’ll deliver one idea you can validate this week, plus 10 interview questions and 5 outreach templates.”\n\n\\- VC analysts: “One-page memo per theme: where money is leaking, recent fines/settlements, and 3 sample bets.”\n\n\\- Existing SaaS: “Expansion gap report” for their exact ICP with 3 bolt-on product ideas.\n\nThen watch who pays, who actually uses the output, and who comes back. I’ve done similar research loops with GummySearch and SparkToro, but Pulse for Reddit has been best for catching in-the-wild rants that confirm whether a gap is real enough to sell into right now.\n\nYour path forward is narrowing the audience and over-delivering on the first 10–20 paid reports, not adding more problems to the database.",

Most of the ingredients go into multiple dishes and small businesses are bad at estimating, or even taking their time inputting everything. For example they need potatoes in half of their dishes, they estimate how much potatoes each dish need. At the end of the day, they served X plates, but used 50% more potatoes. They got clueless and just stop using software. Also quality of ingredient matters, so sometimes you have small potatoes where you basically cut half of them away, sometimes you have good large ones.  \n  \nIf you really want to have per-dish cost you need person who wants to do this, spend their time investigating why today they used more potatoes than yesterday. Re-calculating frequently. Changing how much each dish needs based on previous results and uncertainties. Most small owners don’t want to do this. And those that do, can do it in excel. Larger kitchens that serve a lot of food cheaply have dedicated staff for it.  \n  \nno 8 is bullshit, that’s why nobody is trying to solve it. You *don’t* want more staff when there are more customers, because when you have a lot of customers, you don’t want to restock shelves, as that makes your store even more cramped and your customers have worse shopping experience, as they can’t go through aisles easily and pick up items they want. So in peak hours, you need more cashiers and in slower hours you restock shelves. Slowest day is sanitary day, when you scrub everything religiously. Since same people can do all three, you just shift them where they are needed the most. Cleaning shelves in peak times is NOT a good idea.  \n  \nBut good exercise on your part. If you truly want to do any of these, find someone who actually does this and talk to them, what they would pay for and try to describe to them, what they would actually need to do even if you wrote perfect software",

Like I get it weekends will obviously be more rush than weekdays, but like you never know when 10 new customers start showing up on a random wednesday everytime from next week right? Also, aren't the restockers different from the cleaners and that different from the cashiers? Like I would assume all of these people are doin different works and sticking their designated job right, not sharing responsibilities or am I just dumb? Also, lastly, couldn't we just straight up go Elon (on Twitter) on these by just replacing 80% of the workforce with robotics (by let's say mid 2030s)?",

                  "text": "\nnot bad questions at all!  \n1. same people do everything. That’s why retail job is so hard, because you have multiple responsibilities. Larger stores usually have part time workers that only do single task (cashiers, people to restock items), but these only handle “baseload” demand, any peaks and lows are handled by full time employees  \n2. peaks are usually well defined. Hours when people are going home from work. Weekends (Fridays and Saturdays). Holidays. You know them and expect them. Of course there are some slight variation, like you said 10 people decide to go shopping to your store, but thanks to law of large numbers, it evens out over few days. “Law of large numbers” is that if you throw a dice one time, you can have any result from 1 to 6 with same chance. But if you throw dice hundred of times, it’s very unlikely you will throw sum close to 100 or 600, it will most likely be somewhere near the middle. Same with shoppings. Some may decide to come today, some new customers may decide to go to competitor, but since you have thousands of customers it evens out to some average. Sure, some days are slightly stronger than others for no reason, but you just push some work day or two, because you won’t have 10 or 20 unexpected strong days in a row. There will be slow days and you’ll catch up, re stock shelves and do all the maintenance needed.  \n3. retail work is very flexible. For example letting your shelves be completely empty and then restock it is much more efficient, but also may result in customers leaving compared to restocking frequently. What that means is that if you have several strong days in a row and you are unable to do everything you should (for example you didn’t restock shelves for two days), it is then less work to catch up, but if it took too long you might lose some customers. But generally if you should check vegetables every two hours and you check it every 2,5 hours, nothing bad happens. If you should have sanitary day once per week and you do it on 8. day, store won’t rot. If you restock your shelves slightly less frequently, change is barely noticeable for customers. That means, when you have more customers than you expected, you just do work less often and usually it makes no difference until it is really bad. But in normal operations, you just catch up later and catching up is easy, you won’t have twice as much work if you don’t do everything you should one day",

Privacy as a feature resonating harder in Germany than the US makes total sense, and it probably extends to most of the DACH region. If you translate to German, you might want to also look at Austrian and Swiss tech communities since they share that same privacy-first mindset.\n\n  \nAlso the pattern you described where the growth came from a random tweet and a blog finding you organically rather than your own promotion efforts is so common it should be a law. Building something genuinely useful and then just being present and helpful in communities seems to work better than any launch strategy. Your Product Hunt ranking vs the organic blog pickup is a perfect example.\n\n  \nThe Flutter + C++ combo for keeping the binary small is a good call. Electron apps have trained people to accept 200MB for a text editor so when something launches in under a second and stays under 30MB it immediately feels different.\n\n  \nCurious about the Windows beta, are you seeing similar adoption patterns there or is it still early? And have you considered reaching out to privacy-focused publications directly since that angle clearly resonates with your audience?",

The problem you identified (resume editing on the go without 300MB bloatware) is one of those frustrations that feels obvious once someone points it out.\n\nWhat stood out to me: you validated demand before building anything complex. Starting with a simple, offline-first MVP and charging only on mobile is smart positioning. Most PDF tools went the opposite direction -- adding features until they became too heavy to justify.\n\nCurious about your tech stack choice. Did you build native or go cross-platform (Electron/Tauri)? I'm working on a B2B SaaS product and constantly weighing the offline-first vs cloud-sync tradeoff. For enterprise clients, having both is often non-negotiable, but for consumer tools like yours, the offline angle is clearly a differentiator.\n\nAlso interested in how you handled mobile payments. One-time purchase vs subscription is a positioning choice that affects LTV math significantly. Did you A/B test pricing or go with gut instinct?\n\nKeep shipping!",

That point about distribution vs product is so real, especially for indie devs. I’d just add that building a direct line of communication with your users can be a game changer, especially as you scale. People remember when the dev actually listens, fixes stuff, or ships a small feature they asked for. Even just having a super simple feature voting board or way for users to submit and upvote requests can drive a lot of engagement and trust, and it keeps your roadmap focused on real problems. I built a product to help with this in the Chrome extension space and happy to share details if you’re curious, but the philosophy is basically the same: turn your user base into a feedback loop and let them help you shape what comes next. Keeps users coming back and talking about you.",

You accidentally built something way more interesting than a Divoom clone.\n\n  \nThe fact that you went C++ for the rendering layer and Node.js as the app brain is a solid architecture choice. Keeping the apps web-based means anyone can build for it without learning embedded stuff, which is exactly what would make this viable as a product.\n\n  \nMoving to a custom PCB is where things get real though. That is a completely different game from prototyping with a Pi. If you have not already, look into getting a few quotes from PCBWay or JLCPCB early even if the design is not final. Knowing your per-unit cost at different volumes will tell you a lot about whether the product math works.\n\n  \nOne thing I would think about: the knob-based navigation is a killer feature for a desk device. No one wants to pull out their phone to change what is on their desk display. That physical interaction is what separates this from just being a small monitor.",

Its been a very hard journey building this alone in my room going from one prototype to another and porting code from one infra to another figuring out what is the best way to do this without none to take advice from and share progress with. I planned to make this video like 2 months ago but felt so underconfident that this is not ready I shouldn't but recently my whole life went upside down left my job, had a breakup, health went other way. I decided to make this video just a way to respect to honor my efforts so far that I have put in.\n\nTbh I don't really care whether anyone would like this or not but I'm gonna make sure I see this project till the end and I have something on my desk that I truly built because I wanted to.  Not because someone told me to, not because someone told me it's not gonna work, not because someone told me this idea is bad , not because I realized this is going to be a long and hard journey from idea to actual product. There have been times I have been stuck on solving a bug for weeks but never really gave up because this time I just wanted to go all the way and that's what I'm gonna do.\n\nThanks for this comment. I feel a lot more motivated.",

      "text": "I am currently building a one-man app studio. I build SaaS apps for myself, for clients, and recently I've partnered with CEOs who have domain expertise but no tech team - I build it, they run it. That means I'm usually juggling 2-3 projects at once, and I don't have weeks to spend on each one.\n\nRight now I can go from a two-sentence app idea to a working, deployed (high-quality, tested, etc.) product in a few days.\n\nHere's how the system works.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n* I wrote a reusable playbook that lives in `~/.claude/` and travels with me across every project\n* New project starts with a heavy interview - AI asks me 15+ questions about the business, users, design, architecture, etc.\n* Answers get turned into structured docs (schema, architecture, business rules, design system)\n* A phased roadmap gets generated with checkboxes, and the AI works through it while I review every commit\n\n# The problem\n\nAI models like Opus-4.6 and Codex-5.3 are incredibly powerful, but they have blind spots. They don't know your domain, your schema, your business rules, or what they built yesterday. On simple projects this doesn't matter - they can one-shot a landing page or build a simple MVP, but on anything real, the quality deteriorates. They make assumptions, contradict earlier decisions, and build in the wrong direction - often forgetting important details. You can end up spending more time correcting the AI than you would've spent just writing the code yourself.\n\n# The fix: a portable documentation system\n\nI built a reusable playbook that lives outside any project (*of note, I build all of my web/SaaS apps using the same Rails/Inertia/React stack with the same libraries and tools)*:\n\n      ~/.claude/\n      ├── CLAUDE.md                    # Routes to everything below\n      ├── rails-playbook/\n      │   ├── README.md                # Conventions index\n      │   ├── auth.md                  # Authentication\n      │   ├── brand-interview.md       # 15-question project interview\n      │   ├── inertia-react.md         # Frontend setup\n      │   ├── solid-stack.md           # Queue, cache, cable\n      │   ├── stripe-payments.md       # Billing integration\n      │   ├── heroku-deploy.md         # Deployment\n      │   ├── analytics-seo.md         # Analytics & SEO\n      │   ├── email-verification.md    # Email flows\n      │   ├── settings-page.md         # User settings\n      │   ├── contact-page.md          # Contact forms\n      │   ├── legal-pages.md           # Terms, privacy\n      │   ├── logo-generation.md       # Brand assets\n      │   ├── env-template.md          # Environment variables\n      │   └── project-structure.md     # Directory layout\n    \n\nThe `CLAUDE.md` file is basically a table of contents. Claude reads it at the start of every session and knows where to find patterns for auth, payments, deployment, frontend architecture - whatever applies. Each project only pulls what it needs.\n\n# Interview first, code second\n\nWhen I start a new project, I spend a good chunk of time running an interview covering the business model, user types, core workflows, design preferences, edge cases, etc. The AI asks the questions and I answer in plain English.\n\nThose answers get turned into structured project docs folder:\n\n* `SCHEMA.md` \\- every table, column, relationship, index\n* `ARCHITECTURE.md` \\- technical decisions, service patterns, key flows\n* `BUSINESS_RULES.md` \\- domain logic, permissions, edge cases\n* `DESIGN.md` \\- colors, typography, component patterns\n* `CODE_QUALITY.md` \\- rules for clean, maintainable code\n* `TESTING.md` \\- test principles and conventions\n* `VIEWS.md` \\- UI specification, layouts, routes, role-based access\n* `INERTIA_RAILS.md` \\- frontend/backend integration patterns\n* `PROJECT_SETUP.md` \\- local dev and deployment\n* `ROADMAP.md` \\- phased implementation plan\n* `CLAUDE.md` \\- project-level AI instructions\n\nThese docs become the project's source of truth. Every time the AI starts a task, it reads them.\n\n# The roadmap engine\n\nThe roadmap is the holy source of truth. For my current project (a multi-tenant incident management system for property restoration), the roadmap has 9 phases and 153 checkboxes. Each phase builds on the last, adds tests, code reviews, etc:\n\n1. Foundation (firing up the app, auth, creating model, permissions)\n2. Properties (CRUD, assignments, scoping)\n3. Incidents core (creation, dashboard, status transitions)\n4. Communication (messages, contacts, notifications)\n5. Field operations (labor, equipment tracking)\n6. Documentation (notes, attachments, daily logs)\n7. Reporting\n8. E2E testing\n9. Polish & deploy\n\nThe AI works through the roadmap phase by phase. It checks off items as they're completed, adds notes about decisions made, and references which docs informed each choice. When I come back to a project after a few days, I don't have to remember where I left off - the roadmap tells me.\n\n# The hooks\n\nAfter every commit, a post-commit hook automatically runs against the changed files. It checks:\n\n* **Linters** \\- ESLint, TypeScript, RuboCop\n* **Design system** \\- no hardcoded colors, no raw `<button>` or `<input>` (use the component library), no border radius violations\n* **Architecture rules** \\- no N+1 database queries, no frontend date formatting, no hardcoded routes, no data aggregation on the client\n\n# I still review everything\n\nI review every commit. The system asks for permission before running commands, and I read the diffs before approving. I could bypass the permission prompts and let it run fully autonomous, but I want oversight.\n\nWhen something looks wrong, I catch it in review and course-correct. The playbook means those corrections are rare because the AI already knows the patterns, but they still happen. \n\n# What's next\n\nThe system keeps getting better as I add to it. Some things I'm exploring:\n\n* **Figma MCP** \\- plugging Figma directly into the workflow so the AI can reference actual design mockups instead of just written design tokens\n* **Image generation MCP** \\- using tools like Nano Banana to generate brand logos, marketing images, and SVGs during the brand interview phase instead of stubbing them out\n* **Better hooks** \\- The hooks don't catch as much as they should in terms of code that goes against the code quality docs. Not sure why, but these need improvement\n* **Faster service integrations**  \\- automating the boring setup steps like buying domains, wiring up error monitoring, and configuring API keys across environments\n\n# Results\n\nI've shipped four projects so far using this system and in 95% less time than it would've taken me 6 months ago. The code is consistent across projects because the playbook enforces the same patterns. New features land faster because the AI already knows the architecture instead of me re-explaining it every session.\n\nEvery project is a new learning experience and I'm continuously refining the playbooks and setup. Maybe one day I'll get it to one-shot complex apps with a one sentence prompt.\n\n---\nIf you're looking for a project to build and test your own system on, I have a whole database of ideas at https://cloneabledb.com/ - each idea comes with all the information you need to get started",

Don't add things \"just in case\" or because the playbook mentions them. Every piece of code should have a clear reason to exist for THIS project.\n    - **Be fully clear on the task** - Before starting work, make sure you understand exactly what's needed. If instructions are ambiguous or you're unsure whether something applies, ask rather than guessing. A quick question saves hours of unwanted work.\n    - **Only build what's requested** - Don't add extra integrations, services, or infrastructure beyond what the project actually needs. The playbook is a menu, not a checklist.\n    - **Use claude-mem** - Check memory before expensive searches\n    - **Use Context7** - Check docs before implementing libraries",

Pretty hit or miss so far on using it - no rhyme or reason for when it chooses to use them. I may look more into this.\n\n2. I have not used worktrees\n\n3. I've been using Claude exclusively - however, I recently bought a ChatGPT subscription for OpenClaw and have been testing Codex-5.3 and it has really surprised me. On larger/more complex projects, I think Codex-5.3 may produce better results than Claude... I'm just really locked into Claude with my setup and don't want to port all of that over to Codex!",

It allows me to scroll and see things that I want to see, but usually I don't want to switch between subreddits or create a separate account to track my likes of what I want to watch. So this is pretty nice. \n\nI would say the biggest thing for me is that you give us the option to search for subreddits and add a category that we can view. But there's no way to make sure that when it searches it only pulls back nsfw. So I would say if you can make an option to when you search. If you can toggle only NSFW subreddits that way I can make sure that it doesn't mix in regular stuff.\n\nBut definitely work on the scaling and loading of the site better because it definitely seems to have hit capacity",

The biggest limitation of most AI chat interfaces is that everything gets flattened into markdown, which works fine for text but completely falls apart when you need to actually interact with the output. Tables you cant sort, charts you cant zoom, data you cant copy cleanly.\n\n  \nRendering actual UI components is the right direction. Curious about a few things:\n\n  \nHow do you handle the boundary between what the AI generates vs what gets rendered? Like if the model outputs something unexpected, does it degrade gracefully or does the whole response break?\n\n  \nAlso, is the component set fixed (charts, tables, etc) or can the AI decide to render arbitrary components? The former is way more stable but the latter is way more interesting.\n\n  \nNice work making it open source too. Thats the kind of project where community contributions could really expand the component library fast.",

However, LLMs have come a long way since then, and they're now capable of producing really good looking software amd websites. So, I thought I would love to introduce that to the normal conversation. To answer your questions so far the components it can use are fixed, they're basically the most basic fundamental components such as: Tables, charts, stepers, card, etc. it offer stability and so far it never broke, since the LLM output is basically json format and then the app translate that into UI components. And if the model output something that the app didn't understand then it will just get shown as text, so theoretically there's no way the response could break the app. In the future I am thinking about letting the AI generate the components arbitrarily, but as you said it will probably be less stable since it's prone to hallucinations.\n\nEdit: typo.",
