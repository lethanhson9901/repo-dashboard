You could use it to prototype the user presence model, save sessions, and trigger **notifications** when friends start a session.  \n  \nCool project—would love to see how you handle the “live” aspect without turning it into a surveillance app.",

What was worse was when you had a project that took 3 months to deliver, then you invoice, then they take 120 days to pay, so you get paid *7 months* after you do the work. \n\nIf you are paying salaries for your team that really hurts. You effectively loan your customer money for 7 months.\n\nWhen you’re a small start up and they are a multi-billion revenue company, it feels abusive.\n\nThe factor in things like ‘we changed payroll and your billing code got lost’, which then takes 3 months to rectify and pay you the overdue invoices, with your local contacts are unable to help because procurement are in a tax haven jurisdiction and don’t have anyone you can speak to directly - just an email box.\n\nThese are all real things that pushed us to the limits of sanity and solvency as a small millions ARR company trying to service larger companies.\n\nOf course there are solutions; invoice factorisation for one, or loans as someone else mentioned, but these all cost YOU more money and admin. Also you can try to load a portion of the contract as an engagement fee at project commencement (at least then you get paid something 30 days after you deliver on a 3 month project), or break the project into staged delivery for the same reasons.\n\nWe would try to have as little as possible outstanding payable at ‘project delivery’, but this also is hard when you’re relatively small and you’re dealing with a very large customer.  The team that bought your services and values what you do is not the procurement department who you negotiate with for renewals, and they are often OKR’d on getting. Annual renewal reductions.\n\nSo while your costs increase yearly, you are being pushed to REDUCE your billing amount.\n\nThis happened to us too.\n\nThey literally were paying an expensive international consultancy goodness-knows how much, to try and enforce a ‘productivity framework’ on our delivery, that demanded 5% annual productivity gains, with flat to declining annual revenue.\n\nIt’s very hard starting your own business. It’s very hard running your own business. It’s very hard growing your own business. We ultimately did ok, but it was never easy. \n\nThe last thing that frustrated me was that it felt like the larger companies were structured to suffocate innovation. They would bring us precisely because we were what they were not; agile, innovative, and delivering successfully, then spend all their time trying to break us.",

A few things that have helped me navigate this\n\n\n\nFirst negotiate partial payments or milestones. Instead of waiting 90 days for the full amount see if you can structure it as 30 percent upfront 40 percent at some milestone and 30 percent on completion. This helps with cash flow even if the final payment is still delayed.\n\n\n\nSecond factor in these payment delays into your pricing. If you know youll be waiting 90 days your effective cost of capital goes up. Dont be afraid to price that in especially for enterprise deals. Theyre used to paying more for the stability and support they expect.\n\n\n\nThird consider invoice financing or a line of credit secured by receivables like someone mentioned. Its not free money but it can bridge the gap if you really need cash flow. Just make sure the terms make sense for your business.\n\n\n\nLastly keep building your pipeline. The best hedge against long payment cycles is having multiple revenue streams so youre not completely dependent on one big customer paying on time. Congrats on landing the deal though thats a huge milestone.",

          "text": "This is super common with enterprise deals and honestly one of the biggest culture shocks when you move from selling to startups to selling to big companies. Net 90 is actually on the longer end but Net 30 or Net 60 is pretty standard.\n\n\n\nThe reality is large companies optimize for their own cash flow not yours. They know smaller vendors need them more than they need any individual vendor so they push these terms. Its frustrating but its just how enterprise sales works.\n\n\n\nA few things that have helped me deal with this. First make sure your contract has clear payment milestones. Dont wait 90 days for the full amount if you can negotiate getting paid in tranches like 30 percent upfront 30 percent at 30 days etc.\n\n\n\nSecond this is exactly why runway matters so much. You need enough cash to operate for at least 6 months without any revenue coming in because enterprise deals both take forever to close and take forever to actually pay. If you dont have that buffer youre going to be stressed every month.\n\n\n\nThird consider invoice factoring or a line of credit against your receivables like others mentioned. It costs money but if youre really cash strapped it can keep you afloat. Just make sure the math works and youre not giving up too much margin.\n\n\n\nFourth and this is important get really aggressive about following up on invoices. Large companies will absolutely just not pay you on time if you dont stay on top of them. Their accounts payable department has no urgency unless you create it.\n\n\n\nCongrats on landing the deal though. This is a good problem to have even if it doesnt feel like it right now.",

Si el cliente es grande, también podría intentar un **confirming inverso** donde el cliente seguiría pagando a 90 días, pero tú puedes cobrar antes vía su banco. Otra opción es abrir una **línea de crédito**, para solventar posibles problemas de flujo de caja si llegara el caso.\n\nDesde el punto de visto de **modelo operativo**, intentaría introducir la práctica de cobrar por **hitos** parciales (minimizando los grandes periodos de facturación y cobro).\n\nPero en cualquier caso, conforme vayáis teniendo más clientes, iréis teniendo mayor poder de negociación, y podréis establecer más medidas para que no haya tanto impacto en el cash flow.\n\nEnhorabuena de nuevo.",

It’s frustrating and time-consuming.\n\nFor those who don’t know launch directories are websites where new products and startups get listed and showcased to an audience actively looking for new tools and solutions. They’re like curated marketplaces or hubs for discovery, not just random link dumps.\n\nIt’s annoying to find a good list, so I finally sat down and built a proper list of launch directories: sites like Product Hunt, BetaList, StartupBase, etc. Ended up with 82 legit ones.\n\nI also added a way to sort them by DR (Domain Rating) basically a metric (from tools like Ahrefs) that estimates how strong a website’s backlink profile is. Higher DR usually means the site has more authority and might pass more SEO value or get more organic traffic.\n\nI turned it into a simple site: [launchdirectories.com](http://launchdirectories.com/)\n\nNo fluff, no paywall, no signups just the list I wish I had every time I launch something.\n\nThought it might help others here too.",

I’d also tag each directory by audience (makers, SMBs, enterprises) and by intent (browse vs. launch-focused) so you’re not wasting time on the wrong crowd.\n\n\n\nFor tracking, a simple sheet with UTMs, status, and conversions is enough to see which sites drive actual signups instead of just vanity traffic. I’ve used Product Hunt and Indie Hackers for launches, plus Futurepedia for SaaS discovery, and lately Pulse for Reddit to catch threads where people are literally asking for tools like mine so I can reply in context.\n\n\n\nMain thing: treat this list like a system you iterate on, not a one-time promotion blast.",

It was super cool, and the post got around 3k upvotes.\n\nA lot of people asked if it could be extended to browsing all websites, but shortly after, the project was shut down.\n\nI spent about a month and a half working on this idea and managed to solve the \"works for all websites\" part.\n\nNow I have a visual board that can open websites, work with PDFs, and honestly - I really enjoy using it myself :)\n\nI've put [www.rabbitmap.com](http://www.rabbitmap.com/) online for testing. This has been a passion project for me and I'm not seeking financial gain from it.\n\nIf you ever start on an article like Line dancing and end up on the article about the Hubble Space Telescope, RabbiMap might be for you :)\n\n**You can look up any website, PDF, browse the internet, draw connections, add post-it nodes and save your boards!**\n\nIf you'd like to get updates about the project, you can join the community [https://www.reddit.com/r/rabbitmap](https://www.reddit.com/r/rabbitmap)",

Realizing half the data I pulled isn’t actually useful and reworking the logic again. None of it is complicated, it’s just constant.  \n  \nI’ve been using Clay alongside it, and honestly it helped me see how messy my thinking was. Not magically fixing things, but forcing me to be explicit about signals, assumptions, and dependencies. That also means I notice way more small breakpoints than I used to, which is good… and also more work.  \nAt this point I’m spending more time maintaining GTM systems than “building” the project itself. It feels less like shipping and more like keeping a machine running so it doesn’t quietly drift off course.  \nIs this just the normal stage once a project starts touching real data and real workflows?

Same MRI can be $400 at one place and $2,800 ten minutes away. They just hope you won't shop around.\n\nTry it out: [https://chat.momentarylab.com/](https://chat.momentarylab.com/)\n\nStill rough around the edges (built it over the holidays), but would love feedback on what would make it more useful!
