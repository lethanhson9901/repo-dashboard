      "text": "Hi everyone, I made this thing:\n\n[ https://letmewatchnow.com ](https://letmewatchnow.com)\n\nContext: my father’s main way of communicating with our family in 2025 is sending TikTok links on WhatsApp. No messages, no explanation, just TikToks.\n\nUsually links like this:\n\n[https://vm.tiktok.com/ZN..RjeH..Ug/](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZN..RjeH..Ug/)\n\nI love him, but I really don’t want the TikTok app on my phone.\n\nEvery time I open one of those links on my phone it’s:\n\n“Open in app”\n\n“No”\n\n“Install app”\n\n“No”\n\n“Are you sure?”\n\nYes. Very sure. I know I can watch them on the browser.\n\nSo out of mild frustration, I vibe-coded LetMeWatchNow in a short session.\n\nWhat it does:\n\n•\tPaste a link and it opens the video directly in the browser, because if you erase the search parameter, you can watch on the browser. I automated that.\n\n•\tWorks with TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts and X\n\n•\tNo app, no account, no login walls\n\n•\tCleans URLs by removing tracking parameters\n\n•\tExpands short links so you can see the real destination\n\n\\------------------\n\nThis was also an excuse to try PostHog. Tracking is minimal and only enabled if you accept cookies. No personal data, just basic “did this feature get used” events so I know what breaks or what nobody touches. If you don’t accept cookies, nothing runs.\n\nAlso, English is not my first language, so sorry in advance for any weird phrasing or translation mistakes.\n\nIf you try it, feedback is very welcome. Weird edge cases, or “this doesn’t work” comments help a lot.\n\nThere’s also a Ko-fi link if you want to help with server costs, but it’s completely optional and the site will stay free anyway.\n\nThat’s all.\n\nHappy New Year!\n\n————-\n\nUpdate: Thank you so much for the support and feedback! 💚💚💚\n\nI've already implemented one of your suggested features: iOS Shortcuts (Automation) support! 🚀\n\nYou can now create a \"one-tap\" workflow: when you share a link from WhatsApp/Instagram, the shortcut automatically opens LetMeWatchNow with the link already pasted and sanitized. Then you just tap \"Watch Now\" and you're done.\n\nI've added a step-by-step visual guide on the website to help you set it up. I will keep exploring the rest of your ideas!\n\n  \n\\--------\n\nUpdate 1/1: Wow so many upvotes thank you so much, i didn't expect that.\n\nJust pushed the shortcut download link to the website so the setup is much easier.\n\nAlso, added examples of links so can be more clear which are the limits of the app for now.

No paywalls, no subscriptions, just optional support. That's how side projects should work.\n\n\n\nOne suggestion: Have you considered adding a browser extension? Could auto-redirect TikTok/IG links to your site without copy-pasting. Would be especially useful for WhatsApp Web where people send a ton of these links.\n\n\n\nAlso curious about the PostHog analytics - are you seeing any interesting usage patterns? Like which platforms people use it for most?\n\n\n\nGreat execution on solving a personal pain point. Happy New Year!",

So now instead of getting one $50 payment, my friend is getting like $8.23 on Tuesday, $12.91 on Thursday, $6.44 on Saturday... you get it. Each one is a separate Venmo notification.\n\n\n\nI've been using it on my friends all week. Reactions have been mixed (mostly annoyed, which is the point).\n\n\n\nAlso added a mode where you can request money the same way - so if someone owes YOU, you can spam them with 7 tiny payment requests instead of one.\n\n\n\nAnyway, here it is: [https://drizzle.money](https://drizzle.money)\n\n\n\nLemme know what you think or if you have ideas to make it worse.",

The SEO angle is definitely part of it, but the differentiation is what I’m betting on.\n\nMost “best of” sites are either editorial (one person’s opinion) or just aggregating Amazon ratings. This is neither - it’s sentiment analysis on actual owner discussions, weighted by whether someone says they own the thing vs just heard about it. The grading system reflects consistency of positive sentiment, not just volume.\n\nWhether Reddit likes it or not probably depends on whether the rankings actually match what people experience. So far the feedback on specific categories has been decent - people seem to appreciate when the data confirms (or challenges) the usual recommendations.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

      "text": "Last month I tried to record a webinar for my course. Twenty minutes of content. Should've been easy.\n\nTake one: forgot my second point halfway through. Started over.\n\nTake two: stumbled on the pricing section. Started over.\n\nTake three: nailed it — then realized my notes were visible in the screen recording. Started over.\n\nTake four, five, six... I lost count.\n\nThree hours later, I had one usable take. And I sounded exhausted in it.\n\nThe problem wasn't that I didn't know the material. I *wrote* the material. But the moment I hit record, my brain decided to forget everything. And every time I glanced at my notes? My eyes moved away from the camera. You could tell I was reading.\n\nI tried a few teleprompter apps. One covered half my screen. Another scrolled at a fixed speed — too fast when I paused, too slow when I got excited. And all of them showed up in my screen recordings. Completely useless.\n\nSo I built my own.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n**Notchie** sits in the MacBook notch area - right below the camera. You read your script while looking directly at the lens.\n\nTwo features that actually matter:\n\n**1. Voice-activated scrolling.** The text follows your voice, not the other way around. Speed up — it keeps pace. Pause to let an idea land - it waits. You speak naturally. The script adapts to you.\n\n**2. Invisible during screen sharing and recording.** When you share your screen or record, the prompter isn't captured. Your audience sees your slides. You see your talking points. Nobody sees your script.\n\nThat webinar I struggled with? Recorded it in one take after building this.\n\n**Everything else:**\n\n* **Fully adjustable** — width, height, font size, opacity, scroll speed. Set it up once, forget about it.\n* **Dark and light mode** — because some of us record at midnight.\n* **Multiple notes** — different scripts for different sections or calls.\n* **Auto-advance** — finish one note, next one starts automatically.\n* **Drag & drop sorting** — reorder your scripts for multi-part recordings.\n* **Keyboard shortcuts** — adjust speed on the fly without breaking your flow.\n\n**Who actually uses this:**\n\n* **Course creators** — stop doing 15 takes per lesson.\n* **Webinar hosts** — present for an hour without losing your place.\n* **YouTubers** — read your script, look at the camera, sound natural.\n* **Sales teams** — demos where you hit every feature, every time.\n* **Remote workers** — look polished on every call, even Monday morning ones.\n\n**Pricing:**\n\n$29.99 one-time. No subscription. Yours forever.\n\nThere's a 90-minute free trial on the site if you want to test the voice sync and see it disappear during screen share.\n\n**Website:** [notchie.app](https://notchie.app)\n\nHappy to answer any questions or take feedback. What am I missing?",

I've had the exact same experience recording videos for my projects - that moment when you realize your eyes are clearly reading something off-screen is brutal.\n\n\n\nThe voice-activated scrolling is genius. I've tried fixed-speed prompters too and they're impossibly rigid - you either rush or slow down unnaturally. Having it sync to your actual speaking pace solves the core problem.\n\n\n\nOne thing that would be interesting: does it handle pauses well when you're thinking mid-sentence? Like if you pause for 2-3 seconds to gather your thoughts, does it stay put or does it interpret that as \"done with this section\"?\n\n\n\nAlso curious about Mac Studio Display support - does it work with the external camera or just the built-in notch area?\n\n\n\nGreat execution on this. The \"invisible during recording\" feature alone saves so much frustration.",

              "text": "This is great feedback, thank you! To answer your questions:\n\n**Pauses:** Yes, it handles them well. It simply detects mic level —-when you stop talking, it stops scrolling. You can adjust the mic sensitivity to trigger at specific loudness, and there's also a configurable delay for how long it waits before stopping. So if you pause for 2-3 seconds to think, it just waits. You can tweak these settings to match your speaking style.\n\n**Studio Display / external monitors:** Yep, works with any setup. You can position the prompter window on any screen — external monitor, Studio Display, whatever. It's not locked to the notch area, that's just the sweet spot on MacBooks since it's right below the camera.\n\nThe free trial on the website lets you test all of this - 90 minutes, no credit card needed.\n\nAnd thanks for the kind words on the \"invisible during recording\" feature - that was the main reason I built it in the first place!",

That 2-3 second buffer for gathering thoughts makes total sense.\n\n\n\nAnd the external monitor flexibility is great to hear. Having it work with Studio Display means this could be super useful for anyone doing professional content recording with a proper camera setup, not just MacBook users.\n\n\n\nThe 90-minute free trial is a smart move - gives plenty of time to really test it out in real scenarios. Definitely going to try this for my next webinar prep. Thanks for building something that actually solves a real pain point!",

So I kept going and built my own version completely independently, just like he did. Nothing wrong with that.\n\nAlong the way I also saw a couple of other tools with pretty rough UI, so I decided to aim for something cleaner, more usable, and a bit more feature-packed.\n\nThat’s the whole story 🙂",

No spam, no low-effort garbage, just stuff worth reading.\n\nHeres how it went.\n\n**Stats:**\n\n* 410 unique visitors (got a small spike from HN and Reddit)\n* 10 people hit signup\n* 2 went through payment\n* 1 actual paid message\n\n**The message:**\n\nSomeone paid $1 to post a link to an anti-pornography website with the text \"Porn—the enjoyment is temporary, damage is permanent.\"\n\nI hid it for spam lol. *(EDIT: Done, unhid it. You guys are right - they paid, it stays)*\n\nSo technically my total revenue is $1, conversion rate is like 0.26%, ~~and my only paying customer got moderated.~~\n\n**What I learned:**\n\n1. The concept works mechanically - stripe, posting, moderation, all good\n2. Doesn't work socially though - empty chat room is a dead chat room and nobody wants to be first\n3. \"If you build it they will come\" is bs\n4. I way over-engineered the site. I had something called \"THE CODEX\" with pseudo-legal articles like §1.1 lmao. fixed that\n\n**Whats next:**\n\nNot sure honestly. Product works, idea is different. But chat needs people and people need other people already there. Chicken and egg.\n\nMaybe just need one good conversation to break the ice. Or maybe this is a $1 lesson in why chat products are hard idk.\n\nIf you wanna be the first real message on OneDollarChat, its there: [https://onedollarchat.com](https://onedollarchat.com)",

Add option to a picture but instead 1 USD\nMake it like 3 USD, want short video upto 10sec? Make it 10 USD maybe.\n\n\n2. Collab!!! Research good causes and set a future specific day of weekend or few days that some of the amount will go to those causes.\n\n\n3. Think of a theme concept, but a simple one, could be unique, with specific colour palate to make people \"feel\" the vibe! Couloful or not its your choice!\n\n\n4. Make it clean, simple but adjustable, but more importantly make it feel like a fun experience everyone want to take part in! Even as an occasional reader!\n\n\n5. Maybe make replies in text half a dollar? Anyway please make sure you enjoy each step of the process! Cheers!",

Meta bantered about going to a full sub model with FB and Insta but their users would likely dip. X has created a sub model that allows premium features and people are paying but I have no idea of their conversion rate. I suspect it’s low. I’d venture that engagement would drop precipitously if people couldn’t freely tweet and that would cause your paying customers to dip.\n\nWith only 400-ish unique visitors, we’re also working with a small sample size. How are you Marketing the site? I suspect your results will be nearly the same with 1000+ visits but I’d want to see the data.",

People want to converse, but no one wants to hold a conversation for a dollar a message. If the post is a hot topic that people want to comment on, I’d be disinterested in doing so if I can’t rebuttal or continue a convo without constantly paying.\n2.1. Maybe 1 dollar allows you to create a post and pennies give you credits to comment.\n3.

      "text": "YEAR REVIEW!\n\nOkay so, 2025. What even was this year. Let me tell you about my entrepreneurial journey or whatever because it's actually insane and also kind of sad but also funny? I don't know anymore.  \n\n\n**The Part Where We Were Actually Making Money (shocking, I know)**\n\nSo early 2025, right? Me and my co-founder are literally just CHILLING with THREE projects running, 2 of them were making money at the same time. I know, I know — \"another guy wannabe talks about making 10k mrr\" — but hear me out.\n\nWe made this LinkedIn roaster thing (LiRoast, you can Google it. No promo links here). You drop your LinkedIn profile link, and it roasts you. Very original (not at all). Very cool (maybe). It went kinda viral because apparently people LOVE being told their profile sucks. Can relate here.\n\nBig brain moment: we realized \"wait... these people who care about LinkedIn enough to get roasted... they'll buy stuff.\"\n\nSo we made:\n\n* **ApplyKit** — helps you not be cringe on LinkedIn\n* **GetApiHub** — LinkedIn scraper, you know what it is, I'm not explaining it\n\nAnd dude. GetApiHub was PRINTING. Subscriptions from $30 to $1,500 a month. I still remember my co-founder calling me in the middle of the night like, \"WE JUST GOT OUR FIRST $1.5K/MONTH SUB.\"\n\nThat feeling? Unmatched.\n\n  \n**The Part Where It All Goes Wrong (you knew this was coming)**\n\nStripe said \"nah fam\" and banned us permanently.\n\n*What?!*\n\n\"High risk of disputes\" they said. Our dispute rate was literally below average. BELOW. AVERAGE. We were being GOOD.\n\nBut here's the 5000 IQ play we somehow managed to pull off — we emailed the CEO of Stripe directly. Like actual Patrick Collison. And someone actually responded and unbanned us. (Not Patrick himself, ofc, lol)\n\nEpic moment, right?\n\nWRONG.\n\nLinkedIn's lawyers sent us a letter. And not like a \"hey bestie\" letter. More like a \"shut everything down or we'll destroy you\" letter.\n\nSo yeah. Three projects. Dead. Same day. $11k MRR to $0 speedrun.\n\nThe worst part? Emailing customers to tell them we're done. These people LIKED us. They were NICE about it. Somehow that made it worse???\n\n**The \"What Do We Do Now\" Arc**\n\nOkay so now we're at $0 with nothing but our big brains and crippling entrepreneurial addiction.\n\nWe tried building a [Temporal.io](http://Temporal.io) competitor called Schedo.\n\nWe failed.\n\nI mean, it EXISTS. It's running. Some people use it for free. We just have NO IDEA how to make actual revenue from it. Small brain moment. Very smol.\n\nAnd here's the thing, going from \"omg Stripe notifications every day\" to NOTHING? That's the worst feeling. Like, it's actually worse than never having success. At least before you didn't know what you were missing.\n\nWe did this partnership thing with Vercel competitor (sherpa) where we give them cron jobs and they give us backlinks. Got like 3 more users. Stonks? Not really stonks. More like... rocks.\n\n**The Redemption Arc (kind of)**\n\nStarted lurking on Reddit for ideas like a normal person. Built a social listening tool thing, similar to GummySearch.\n\nAnd THIS ONE actually worked!\n\nI'm actually proud of this one from a technical perspective. We were spending money and effort on semantic analysis, streaming queues, processing tons of Reddit data. Our results were better than tools charging 5x more (I spent weeks comparing). \n\nBut we couldn't grow it enough so we just **sold it.**\n\nListed it. Got $5k. Cash. Within a WEEK. ([Proof](https://x.com/ilyanovohatskyi/status/1990686778164928573))\n\nThat's actually insane. Like imagine — \"hmm I don't want this anymore\" and someone just gives you $5,000. Business is weird, man.\n\n**What Now? (I genuinely don't know)**\n\nBuilding ZoriHQ now. It's revenue attribution analytics. Open source because selling to developers is PAIN and I'm TIRED. I'm aware of DataFast. I just wanted to build this, since I had this idea way before DataFast even appeared, but never had time to deliver.\n\nAlso made this little tool called pgbranch. Posted it on Reddit. 45 GitHub stars. That's like... mass validation, right? RIGHT?!\n\n**The numbers**\n\n|Project|State|Started|Closed|MRR|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|LinkedInRoaster|Closed|Aug 2024|Feb 2025|$0, free project|\n|ApplyKit|Closed|Oct 2024|Feb 2025|$300|\n|GetApiHub|Closed|Oct 2024|Feb 2025|$11k|\n|Schedo|Running|April 2025|\\-|$0, no idea how to monetize|\n|[Mention.click](http://Mention.click)|Sold for $5k ([Proof](https://x.com/ilyanovohatskyi/status/1990686778164928573))|Jun 2025|Nov 2025|$100|\n|ZoriHQ|Running|Sep 2025|\\-|$0, Open Source|\n|PGBranch|Running|Dec 2025|\\-|$0, 45 GitHub Stars|\n\nSo yeah. 2025. Built stuff. Made money. Lost it all. Built more stuff. Sold something. Now building open source.\n\nVery cool. Very normal year.\n\nHopefully no more lawyer letters, at least in these couple of days of 2025 lol",

If they managed to close way bigger projects - that'd be a matter of time when the cease and desist letter transforms into a full-fledged lawsuit, which we'd 100% have lost.\n\nIf you change an entity, like a different country, you need another Stripe account. It's like playing cat and mouse game, while you are the mouse with a broken leg and almost no place to hide.\n\nAnother thing that came into play, we didn't really try to link our personalities to that LinkedIn scrapper project. But somehow they managed to email us at our emails, which were never made public, but they have been used in personal LinkedIn profiles. That meant they could easily connect the dots, and a second time trying something like this would bring real legal risks. Their OSINT teams really know what they do.\n\nThe final thing is building on top of someone else's product is tricky; they can change the api responses all of a sudden - we'd stop working for a while, etc.\n\nEven though I think LinkedIn is hiding our own public data to sell some crapy software like SalesNav, etc, we can't do anything about it.",

More compliance? Different data source? Or just avoid the platform entirely?\n\nWishing you a boring 2026 (no lawyers, just growth).",

I had 1 paying customer who posted anti-porn content.\n\n24 hours later...\n\n**The stats:**\n\n* 135K views\n* 2,250 unique visitors\n* 148 upvotes\n* 169 comments\n* 12 paid messages\n\n**The hack:**\n\nSomeone gave themselves a balance of $21,474,836.47 (that's INT\\_MAX - the maximum 32-bit integer). On Christmas Day. Their message?\n\n>\"meowww mrrp :3\"\n\nThey also tried XSS injection. Merry Christmas to me.\n\nThe message stays. It's art now.\n\n**What I shipped based on your feedback:**\n\n* Guest posting (no signup needed - just type and pay)\n* Fixed the Safari scroll bug\n* Handled the XSS vulnerability\n* Didn't mass-ban my hackers\n\n**What I'm not doing yet:**\n\nYou guys gave conflicting advice (which is fine):\n\n* \"Make it cheaper!\" vs \"Keep the $1, it's the point\"\n* \"Give free credits!\" vs \"That defeats the purpose\"\n* \"Seed fake messages!\" vs \"Keep it organic\"\n\nSo I'm letting it ride for now. The $1 stays. The chaos stays. The cat stays.\n\n**Lessons from day 2:**\n\n1. Your first users will try to break everything\n2. Integer overflow is a Christmas tradition apparently\n3. \"meowww mrrp :3\" was worth more than my entire marketing budget\n4. Empty rooms fill themselves if you give people a story\n\nIf you want to be part of the world's most unhinged chat room: [https://onedollarchat.com](https://onedollarchat.com)",

      "text": "Hi Reddit!\n\nQuick backstory: My girlfriend was diagnosed with celiac disease last year. In Canada, there's a tax credit to help offset the insane cost of gluten-free products (we're talking 2-3x the price of regular food).\n\nI tried tracking everything in Excel with receipts. Absolute nightmare.\n\nThen I read somewhere that \\~75% of Canadians with celiac disease don't claim this credit. Not because they don't qualify, but because the process is so painful that people just... don't bother.\n\nThat pissed me off.\n\n9 months ago, with literally ZERO dev experience, I decided to build something better. Spent way too many evenings debugging stuff I didn't understand, Googling error messages, and rewriting the same feature three times until it finally worked.\n\nToday, I'm genuinely proud to say Glutax is live on the App Store 🎉\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* Scan your receipt → automatically saves and extracts all items\n* Select which items are gluten-free (super user-friendly interface)\n* Assign each GF product to a category (sets the reference price vs. regular gluten version)\n* Tax credit calculated automatically after each receipt\n* End of year: generate a complete report with all products and receipts\n* Export everything ready to hand to your accountant (turnkey solution!)\n* Available in both French and English\n\n**The tech stack** (for the curious):\n\n* Swift for the iOS app\n* PHP backend + MySQL database\n* RevenueCat for subscription management\n\nI'd love any feedback from the community. What would make this more useful? What am I missing?\n\nThanks for reading! 🙏",

I decided to use it for a simple task and not make “AI” the main selling point. In my use case, users need to scan receipts anyway to keep them, so I extract the data with AI and reconstruct it as JSON. Makes it really user-friendly to just select what’s gluten-free.\nSuccess rate isn’t 100%, so users can manually edit any receipt info. I inform them to verify everything is correct, and they can still edit after it’s in the system. I also have the AI assign a confidence score - basically asking “does everything add up to the total?” If the score is too low, the app adapts and walks the user through a step-by-step process to enter the info while keeping good UX.",

I was just curious, google tells me: In Canada, about **1.9% of adults follow a gluten-free diet**, with slightly higher rates in younger adults (18-49) and women.\n\nThat gels with your situation, you built it for your girlfriend. Where does your girlfriend go to search for information? Are there celiac forums on fb, reddit or with that age range is it on tiktok?\n\nPersonally I'd start with tiktok, make a few short videos about gluten-free stuff and see if it gets picked up. As it's more women than men, can your girlfriend do the voiceover or appear in it? Tiktok is a great tool for creating visibility, the algorithm is ridiculously accurate at times in my experience.\n\nThen I'd make a few videos around your tax deadline in Canada as that will get pushed. 'Are you celiac? Do you know you could be saving X dollars a year on your tax return? Here's how to do it for 2026...this app will cost you X but will potentially save you Y on your taxes.'",

It’s frustrating and time-consuming.\n\nFor those who don’t know launch directories are websites where new products and startups get listed and showcased to an audience actively looking for new tools and solutions. They’re like curated marketplaces or hubs for discovery, not just random link dumps.\n\nIt’s annoying to find a good list, so I finally sat down and built a proper list of launch directories: sites like Product Hunt, BetaList, StartupBase, etc. Ended up with 82 legit ones.\n\nI also added a way to sort them by DR (Domain Rating) basically a metric (from tools like Ahrefs) that estimates how strong a website’s backlink profile is. Higher DR usually means the site has more authority and might pass more SEO value or get more organic traffic.\n\nI turned it into a simple site: [launchdirectories.com](http://launchdirectories.com/)\n\nNo fluff, no paywall, no signups just the list I wish I had every time I launch something.\n\nThought it might help others here too.",

Quality submissions with good descriptions beat quantity.\n\n\n\nAlso, Product Hunt timing matters - launch on Tuesday-Thursday for best visibility.\n\n\n\nThanks for compiling this!",

The advice about picking 10-15 and doing them well instead of spamming all 100 is spot on. Most directories want tailored descriptions anyway, and rushing through just gets you rejected or buried. Quality over quantity makes way more sense, especially when you're juggling a full-time job and trying to get an MVP out the door without burning out.",

Understand code, and test #1 related topics extensively.\n3. Setup feedback channel for first customers to tackle the lower indicated risks. Support customer to quickly fix. Have a test and production system to avoid you break existing production data.\n\n**Security**\n\n1. Assess general tech stack risks and mitigate. I.e. upgrade to safe versions of PHP, MySQL, Next,..\n2. Mitigate overall all common injection methods, enable rate limiting for brute forcing or upload misusage (making cloud costs skyrocket) \n3. Ensure you did not expose any keys. If you did, reset and avoid republishing\n\nEven though I'm still afraid, this will be my way to go. Share any thoughts to improve !!",

I lost my parents back-to-back to diabetes and heart issues.\n\nI was on the same path: high stress, poor sleep, and prioritizing work. barely knew my kids. I decided i didn't want my kids to lose their dad at my age, so I went all-in on my health. became obsessed with health data, Huberman protocols, Zone 2 training, etc.\n\ngot an Apple Watch Ultra, and assumed the data it gave me was gospel. But after months of \"closing my rings\" and stressing to stay on the \"zone 2\" it showed me, my VO2 Max wasn't moving.\n\ndecided to get a lactate test on the lab, to see what my real zone 2 was. was shocked to find that my \"real\" zone 2 was 10 bpm higher than what the apple watch told me. I was training inefficiently because apple's default algorithm relies on generic age-based math, not the user's wealth of biometrics available (max HR, fitness level, resting heart rate, etc).\n\nThe Solution (The Side Project) I wrote a script to fix it for myself. It cross-referenced my Heart Rate efficiency against my Pace to find my real zones.\n\nI eventually turned that script into an app called Zone2AI.\n\nWhen I first launched it, I posted about it on Reddit in my \"wellness stack,\" but I was too nervous to say \"I built this.\" I had imposter syndrome. I just listed it alongside apps like Oura and Whoop as if I were just a fan.\n\nWhy I'm posting today I realized that if I want this to be a real business, I have to own it.\n\nI built this with a \"Haptic Engine\" so you can run eyes-free (it buzzes when you drift out of zone), and I built it as a Lifetime License because I am sick of paying annual subscriptions for fitness apps.\n\nIt’s live on the store now. If you are a runner or data-nerd, I’d love for you to roast the app flow.",

Not only have I gotten to know them, it has opened my eyes to many aspects of modern day childhood life. \n\nOne of the very best investments I’ve made is joining a country club. Has been amazing for my health habits and social life.  But the best aspect is that The kids spend a ton of time there, all screen-free. Unreal how many of their buddies live glued to video games and social media. Even at 6 years of age. \n\nI’m actually considering homeschooling them. Crazy  how much of their time is wasted in school, even in the very best schools. Read a paper that showed than an hour of 1-1 tutoring, is equivalent to eight hours in school for a kids academic progress\n\nDownside is the social aspect. By my kids are old enough now that they have socialize well. And the Country Club could provide them with all the socializing they need.\n\nFiguring out homeschooling is my big side project for 2026 lol \n\nHappy new year!",

I’m 49, started building products this year with zero coding background (just Claude + Cursor). \n\nEvery time I’m about to post something, there’s this voice saying “who are you to build this?”\n\nBut here’s what I’ve learned: Building from your own pain is the most legitimate reason to build anything.\n\nYou didn’t build Zone2AI because you thought it would make money. You built it because you lost your parents and realized Apple’s algorithm wasn’t going to keep you alive for your kids. \n\nThat’s not imposter syndrome territory - that’s the realest founder story there is.\n\nThe “I was too nervous to say I built this” part actually makes your story MORE credible, not less. \n\nIt shows you’re not some guru trying to sell. You’re a dad who needed a solution and made one.\n\nQuestion: When you finally decided to own it publicly, what changed? Was it a specific moment or just gradual realization that pretending to be a user wasn’t sustainable?\n\nI’m asking because I just shipped a burnout tool (also built it for myself after nearly crashing) and I’m still figuring out the line between “sharing my solution” and “being promotional.” \n\nYour post hits that balance perfectly.\n\nAlso - “Haptic Engine buzzes when you drift out of zone” is brilliant UX. The lifetime license model is smart too. Subscriptions for health apps feel predatory.\n\nRooting for you and Zone2AI. Your kids are lucky to have a dad who took this seriously.",

They’re low effort, poorly written, and are genuinely disheartening to see and read.

There simply aren’t enough carers or volunteers to provide regular conversational support, and prolonged loneliness is genuinely dangerous.\n\nSo I built a simple phone line where older people can call and talk to an AI companion.\n\nA lot of older adults don’t have smartphones or struggle with technology, so this MVP works entirely through a **normal phone number** that can be called from landlines or basic mobiles. You literally just call the number, have a conversation, and hang up when you’re done.\n\nIt’s early and rough, but we already have a small number of paying families using it, and the response so far has been positive.\n\nI’m looking to make this available to more families — if you’re curious, you can try it here: **+44 7414 149199 (it's a UK number)**\n\nHappy to answer questions.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to link our website so here it is: [https://www.albertcares.com/](https://www.albertcares.com/)\n\nEDIT 2: We now have a US number so you can try out the demo there! **+1 628 333 3990**",

We store and process ourselves following GDPR as we are British and it's either the individuals themselves paying for it or families paying for their parents to use it. I agree that it would be brutal so I think we can explore ways to make sure that situation is handled gently. \n\nI chose to answer this in reverse order because I wish to express my own personal views on this matter. I feel there is a genuine human need to be heard. I think the avenues to have this need met gets severely reduced as you get older as people lose mobility, lose friends and the death of third spaces. I believe that AI can help support people with this need as well as help families connected to their loved ones. This essentially is what Albert is all about.\n\nThis need goes beyond supporting elderly people: we are seeing that AI is being used to mentally support tons of people across different ages and cultures. I think we need to have a serious conversation about responsible AI use to help support people mentally. My biggest personal fear is that if we don't have this conversation now, the decision will be made for us without the public's best interest in mind. \n\nWe also need to figure out how we can better support society's most vulnerable and each other because I don't think AI is going to be the silver bullet for the mental health crisis. We can be better in supporting social needs while also exploring how AI can help out with these needs.\n\nI will apologise up front because this is quite a raw answer but I appreciate the question.

      "text": "I wanted to share a side project I’ve been working on for the past 4-5 months.\n\nI built a mobile app called TasteBot for iOS & Android. The goal was to solve a problem I personally faced that I felt many others might relate to. I like to cook and meal prep, but I have a number of constraints based on fitness goals (high protein, low calorie), food sensitivities (gluten), and lifestyle (limited time). Because of that, most recipes I came across were basically unusable.\n\nI’ve also followed various diets in the past (low FODMAP, paleo, vegan) while dealing with some health issues, and ran into the same problem every time.\n\nSo I built something that:\n\n* Generates recipes based on a user’s preferences (diet, allergies, cooking style, fitness goals)\n* Lets you iterate on a recipe instead of starting over (“same thing but lower calorie”, “swap dairy”, etc.)\n* Shows nutritional info and automatically adjusts it based on user-entered servings, for those who track calories and macros\n* Has a photo-to-recipe feature — you can snap a photo of a dish and it generates a recipe that still adheres to your preferences\n* Allows you to create share links for recipes, which can also be used to import them into meal-tracking apps  \n\nTech stack (for anyone curious):\n\n* React Native + Expo\n* Supabase (auth, data)\n* OpenAI (recipe generation + image analysis)\n* FLUX.1 \\[schnell\\] fp8 (image generation)\n* RevenueCat (subscriptions)\n* AdMob (free tier)  \n\nAt this point, I’m mainly trying to get more real users so I can gather feedback and keep improving the app.\n\nSo I have a couple questions for the people here:\n\n* Do you have any ideas for additional features or improvements?  A few I’ve been thinking about:\n   * Organizing recipes into custom “Cookbooks” instead of just a single \"Favorites\" section (e.g., “Weight Loss,” “Holiday Recipes,” etc.)\n   * Longer-term: adding a light social aspect (following friends, liking or commenting on recipes)\n* For developers: what have you found works best for promoting an app and getting those first dozen or so users after publishing?\n\nIf it sounds interesting, the app is called TasteBot on iOS & Android. I’d genuinely love feedback (especially if its critical).",

The API is essentially prompted to return the dish name, cuisine, key ingredients, course, and **confidence**, based on its analysis of the image, which later get passed into the recipe request. If the confidence is below a certain threshold, it tells the user it couldn't identify the dish and to try a clearer photo.\n\nThe user can also enter context alongside the image, which is passed into the prompt to improve its accuracy. So for instance, they could say \"I got this at a cuban restaurant\", and that'll help narrow things down.",

We actually have a blog (not posted yet), where we compare our service with Playwright, Puppeteer, Selenium, etc. If the websites are completely under your control, and you're a developer: Playwright or Puppeteer could be fine. Puppeteer is not great if you would like to use Safari, Firefox, or anything else, so Puppeteer is out of the question for us.\n\nIf you want to write your own solution using Playwright, that's absolutely fine. But there's a high chance you'd end up having to deal with ads, which you want to prevent. You can use an adblocker in Playwright. It's doable, but it's a bit of a hassle. Then, for a lot of websites, you need to accept cookies, which could be harder. There's solutions to this. Then, for certain use cases, you might want to take a screenshot from the US, from Japan, from India (for example, you want to take a screenshot of the pricing page of streaming services). Again, you can build it, but we've already done that, so using a service like ours would take a lot of these troubles away.\n\nBesides that, we offer additional services like storing your screenshots and serving them from a CDN, etc.\n\nWe have a few ideas like yours on the table, mostly in the area of screenshot validation, but I'm happy to discuss interaction as well. We love Firecrawl btw, it's a very well designed service, and we def took some inspiration from them.",

However, we try to act less like a bot, which triggers the CAPTCHA quite a bit less. We also have CAPTCHA detection (under development), so if there's any CAPTCHA which would fail our screenshot, we retry using a different exitpoint/proxy. This requires more resources on our end, which is why it's part of the higher plans, but it doesn't cost credits, since it's our responsibility to make good screenshots.\n\nRegarding the JS issues, do you have an example? If a JS issue completely breaks the UI and it wouldn't render in a normal browser, there's a high chance we also wouldn't be able to render it, but we block certain JS (configurable) to lower this chance. Do you have an example of a scenario where this could be an issue?",

Some things I was considering doing were:\n\n1. Incorporating redaction functionality to allow the user to remove any sensitive information \n2. Giving users the option to capture screenshots from localhost as well as live websites (potentially handy during later stages of development), or for more of a design use case:\n3. Users could add the captured screenshots to a ‘workspace’ which they could share with other people via a secure magic link, where the other people could make notes (collaboration tool - handy for rebrand/redesign/UX reviews), or exporting to tools like Figma\n\nBest of luck with it anyway!",

I think one of the first screenshots we took was of Reddit. Reddit doesn't like bots, and they're very good at blocking them!\n\nOur \"enterprise\" package will have an automatic redact tool. I'm not sure yet if we should use something like AWS comprehend, or an LLM provider, or build our own OCR + redact tool, but we have a future usecase where this is absolutely required (people will be able to screenshot internal systems with PII/PHI soon), and there the screenshots will be auto redacted.\n\nLocalhost is quite tricky for a Saas. We're actually doing it, but we're setting up a temporary tunnel using Cloudflare for this. \n\nFigma: we just created a plugin for this this to import screenshots into Figma using Allscreenshots.

For example, a lot of pages these days use lazy loading of images, which is great for browsing, since only images get loaded which are about to come into the viewport. When making a full page screenshot however, you probably want to load all the images, and not have them lazy loaded.\n\nThere are quite a few websites which load content when you scroll down (imagine instagram). What does it mean to to a full page screenshot of Instagram?\n\nAlso, you want to make a screenshot as quickly as possible, especially when you are dealing with multiple screenshots. But when a website loads an external JS, do you wait for this? How long should you wait? Loading Tailwind through a CDN? You probably want to wait a bit longer if needed. Loading some metrics JS through a CDN? Perhaps waiting for this is less essential. \n\nThese are just the \"obvious\" issues we're dealing with, besides dealing with cookie banners, full screen ads, locality, bot detections, etc etc. It challenging at times, but it's a good challenge!",

Your goal is to find why the page is \"failing to sell\" rather than just listing missing technical tags.\n\n# Analysis Logic:\n1. THE BLINK TEST: What is the immediate \"Visitor Perception\"? (Summarize in 1 sentence).\n2. REVENUE LEAK SIMULATOR: \n   - Identify 3 \"Critical Issues\" that act as leaks.\n   - Assign a \"Unicorn Score\" (0-100). If the site feels inactive or generic, be harsh (score below 40).\n3. NEGATIVE SOCIAL PROOF: Look specifically for data points that make the site look \"dead\" (e.g., low user counts, \"2 monthly lobbies,\" outdated dates). \n4. THE MUTE RULE: If I couldn't read the words, does the design tell me what to do?\n\n# Output Framework:\n\n## 1. The Unicorn Score: [Score]/100\n(Categorize as: 0-40 Red/Critical, 41-70 Amber/Warning, 71-100 Green/Unicorn)\n\n## 2. The \"Reality Check\" Verdict:\n[Provide a 1-2 sentence blunt summary. Example: \"The page clearly explains what it does but fails because its own data shows the community is inactive.\"]\n\n## 3. Visitor Perception:\n\"This is a website where [What a visitor thinks the site is/does].\"\n\n## 4. Revenue Leak Analysis (3 Critical Issues):\n- **Issue 1 (Urgency):** [e.g., No reason to sign up 'now' vs later]\n- **Issue 2 (Social Proof):** [e.g., Identifying 'Negative Social Proof' that suggests a dead community]\n- **Issue 3 (Copy):** [e.g., Feature-heavy vs Outcome-heavy]\n\n## 5. Visual/Copy Grades (A-F):\n- **Visuals:** [Grade]\n- **Copy:** [Grade]\n- **Mobile:** [Grade]\n- **CTA:** [Grade]\n\n## 6. Top 3 \"Quick Wins\":\n1. [Actionable fix]\n2. [Actionable fix]\n3.

POSITIONING & THE \"BLINK TEST\": \n- Can I understand exactly what this product does in 3 seconds?\n- Does the headline address a specific pain point or a desired transformation?\n- Is the \"Awkward Specificity\" rule applied (e.g., \"10,847 users\" vs \"10,000+ users\")?\n2. VISUAL FLOW & DESIGN:\n- Is there a clear visual hierarchy guiding the eye to the primary CTA?\n- Is the signup form or primary action \"Above the Fold\"?\n- Is the design clean, or is there friction/distraction?\n3. PERSUASIVE COPY:\n- Does the copy lead with benefits and outcomes, or just a list of features?\n- Is there a \"Puppy Dog Close\" (giving the user a small win or glimpse of the value before the sign-up)?\n- Is the CTA text action-oriented (e.g., \"Fix my site now\") rather than generic (\"Learn More\")?\n4. TRUST & SOCIAL PROOF:\n- Are there real, non-anonymous testimonials?\n- Are there trust signals (logos, security badges, user counts) near the friction points?\n---\n## Output Format (The Landkit Report Style):\n1. **The Overall Grade:** (A to F)\n2. **The \"Revenue Leak\" Estimate:** (Provide a qualitative estimate of how much potential revenue is being lost due to current friction points).\n3. **The 3-Second Verdict:** (What does a first-time visitor think this site does?)\n4. **The \"Forensics\" Breakdown:**\n   - **Positioning:** [Analysis]\n   - **Design:** [Analysis]\n   - **Copy:** [Analysis]\n   - **Trust:** [Analysis]\n5. **Top 3 \"Quick Wins\":** (High-impact, low-effort changes to implement today).\n6. **The \"Mute Rule\" Check:** (If this page were a video on mute, would it still sell?)\n---\n## Landing Page Data to Analyze:\n[PASTE LANDING PAGE TEXT OR URL HERE]\n```",

Whether it’s a webpage, a Substack or Medium article, a PDF, or just copied text—it converts it into clear, natural-sounding speech. You can listen to it like a podcast or audiobook, even with the app running in the background.\n\nThe app is privacy-friendly and doesn’t request any permissions by default. It only asks for access if you choose to share files from your device for audio conversion.\n\nYou can also take or upload a photo of any text, and the app will extract and read it aloud.\n\nThe app is called Frateca. You can find it on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.texttospeech.app) and the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/frateca-text-to-speech-audio/id6741859465) or use [web version here](https://app.frateca.com/).\n\nThanks for your support, I’d love to hear what you think!",

For example, if THIS IS THE FONT I AM USING and you see a black bar this --> \\[\\] <-- short, it means that only a certain number and combination of letters is possible. This is especially true if they used some kind of highlighting tool and only selected the key words (i.e. not the spaces around them), since the highlighting tool might be unlikely to add variability to the edges. Limiting the character list to common human names further reduces the potential number of permutations.\n\nSince I have zero programming experience, I wonder if someone(s) would be interested in a friendly competition to try to create a tool that would analyze the list of possible character combinations that correspond to every length of black bar for the font(s) used in the Epestein files. It would be great if this tool were also paired with a LLM that, in conjunction with the possible-characters-list, would make an educated guess as to the most likely string. Obviously, it goes without saying that anyone who creates such a tool should take great caution to avoid exposing victims and to keep it focused on exposing the predators.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nWanted to share a small milestone that honestly feels bigger than the number itself.\n\nA few months ago, I started building a tiny SaaS called [Redirectly](https://redirectly.app?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=r/side-project). The original idea was very simple: I kept running into pain around deep links, attribution, and redirects while working on mobile apps, so I decided to scratch my own itch instead of duct-taping solutions every time.\n\nAt first, nothing happened.  \nZero users. Zero revenue. Just logs, bugs, and a lot of “why am I doing this at night after work”.\n\nThen slowly:\n- a few people signed up  \n- someone actually integrated it  \n- and recently… I saw my first real payments coming in  \n\nSo far it’s **$377 total revenue**.\n\nNot life-changing money, but emotionally it hit hard — this is the first time something I built from scratch on my own made money on the internet.\n\n### What I learned so far\n- shipping imperfect > waiting for perfect  \n- real users expose problems you’ll never think of  \n- distribution is harder than coding  \n- even tiny revenue is incredibly motivating  \n- “build in public” actually helps you stay consistent  \n\nI’m still very early, still fixing onboarding, docs, UX, and trying to understand what users actually need. No growth hacks yet, no ads — mostly organic and conversations.\n\nPosting this mostly to stay accountable and maybe encourage someone else who’s stuck at “almost launched”.\n\nHappy to answer questions or share what worked / didn’t.  \nIf you’re building something too — what stage are you at?\n",

      "text": "This is embarrassing to admit but I wasted almost 3 years building products nobody wanted. First one was a Chrome extension for bookmark management, took me 5 months to build, maybe 40 people installed it, 1 left a review. Second was a habit tracking app, 4 months of work, couldn't get anyone to use it past day 3. Third was a budgeting tool that I honestly thought was brilliant, spent 7 months on it, launched to complete silence. Pattern was always the same, I'd build what I personally wanted or what seemed cool, launch it, then be shocked nobody cared.\n\nThe breakthrough wasn't some genius insight, it was pure frustration and a random conversation. I was talking to my friend who runs a small design agency, just venting about my failures. He mentioned how annoying it was managing revisions with clients, all the back and forth, losing track of which version they approved. I wasn't even thinking about products, just asked him how he currently handles it. He showed me this mess of emails, Slack messages, Google Docs comments, screenshots. Said he'd tried a few project management tools but they were all too complicated for just tracking client feedback.\n\nI asked if he'd pay for something simpler. He said probably, depends on price, but honestly his current system was free so it would need to be really simple. That conversation stuck with me. Over the next couple weeks I brought it up with 4 other freelancer friends, just casually. Three of them had basically the same problem and same messy solution. One was even paying $30/month for a tool she barely used just for this one feature.\n\nSo I built the simplest possible version, took me maybe 2 weeks using a template I found. Just upload designs, clients leave feedback with pins, track revision rounds. Showed it to those friends, 2 of them immediately started using it. Asked if they'd pay $20/month, one said yes, one said maybe $15. I set up Stripe, sent them payment links, both actually paid. That was my first $30 MRR and it felt more real than anything from my previous 3 products combined.\n\nPosted about it in some design and freelance communities just saying I built this simple thing, here's what it does. Got maybe 12 signups that first month, 4 converted to paid. Growth was super slow but steady. Now 14 months later I'm at $3.9K MRR with 215 paying users. Not life changing money but it covers my rent and keeps growing 10-15% monthly. What changed wasn't my technical skills, those actually got worse because I started using more templates and tools instead of coding everything. It was building something people were already complaining about to their friends, not what I imagined they might need. Found that pattern studying successful indie founders in [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org) who all had similar stories, they stumbled into real problems through conversations not brilliant shower thoughts. Wish someone had told me that before I wasted 3 years, but better late than never.",

Scroll freezing. Tab eating 3GB+ of RAM.\n\nThe weird part? The iOS app is buttery smooth. Same account, same conversations. Zero issues.\n\nSo I opened DevTools and started digging.\n\n**What I found:**\n\n* Fresh ChatGPT page: 779 DOM nodes\n* After scrolling through history: 89,424 nodes\n* Memory usage: 3.17 GB\n* Active timers: 23,584\n* FPS: dropped to 1-5\n\nThe webapp is built in React with \"virtual scrolling\" — which is supposed to only render what's visible. But here's the problem: React keeps all conversation state in the JavaScript heap\\*\\*.\\*\\* When you scroll, it creates new DOM nodes but never properly garbage collects the old state.\n\nClassic memory leak.\n\nThe iOS app doesn't have this issue because it's native Swift with proper memory management. Apple's OS will kill apps that misbehave. Web browsers are more forgiving... to a fault.\n\nWhat I tried:\n\n1. DOM trimming extension - Removed 74,000 nodes. Memory stayed at 988MB. Lag continued.\n2. User-agent spoofing - Tried to get the mobile version served to desktop. ChatGPT's backend rejected the requests.\n3. Forced refresh button - Works, but it's a band-aid. Annoying.\n\nWhat actually worked:\n\nI built a lightweight client that talks directly to OpenAI's API. Same GPT-5/GPT-4o models. But instead of a bloated React app:\n\n* Vanilla JavaScript (\\~300 lines)\n* \\~20MB memory usage\n* Zero lag\n* Import your ChatGPT history\n* Search that actually works\n\nCalled it GPTRapid:\n\nTL;DR\\*\\*:\\*\\* ChatGPT webapp has a React memory leak. Mobile app is fine because it's native. Built a 20MB alternative. Same models, no lag.",

Why not try fixing the memory leak in a PR, or at least let the react team know what's wrong? There's a high chance you're wrong and it's the actual website code that's causing all this memory usage  - if they're doing constant component re-rendering, for example. It's easy to mess up with react. Also, you'd need a massive history to hit 90K nodes... considering one message would be max 10-20 nodes... Seems like the infinite scrolling they implemented is not working properly if the node count just increases.",

I've wanted to create a directory for all MedSpas across the US to provide free value to our clients and help with top of funnel traffic for sales. I've built 6+ directories over the years. Usually in WordPress. They took hundreds of hours.\n\nToday I built the biggest one I've ever created by far, all in an afternoon:\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1pvurhx/video/ubnmhmie0h9g1/player\n\n\\> I set up a custom script that used Outscraper Google Business API to scrape every med spa in every city across the US (this took about 3 hours to run and cost \\~$200 in API usage)  \n\\> I had cursor set up the site in Astro with full static generation to use programmatic routing for state, city, and treatment pages  \n\\> I set up proper URL structure for the listings (/state/city/business/)  \n\\> I set up proper URL structure for common services (/state/city/service/)  \n\\> SEO backed from the start with proper content layout, schema, meta data  \n\\> I set up dynamic content options for each page (besides the actual business listings) so that each page would have unique content to help with indexability on Google. This is basically having an array of content options for each block of content so that as the pages are generated at scale each page has unique content. (ex: There's a \"Botox in \\[city\\]\" page for every city, but each one has unique content)  \n\\> I set up lead capture forms that are routed to a Supabase Database so we can build custom CRM interface separately. This keeps the entire site static.  \n\\> Everything was done with the site working beautifully after about \\~6 hours.\n\nThe surprising part wasn't generating the pages at scale, it was how little code was needed once all the data model and routing logic was solid. Cursor handled most of the boilerplate and refactor way faster than I could have. I think I used maybe 50 prompts in cursor altogether.\n\nHappy to share more details for any ones interested!\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/i-created-a-179k-page-directory-website-in-6-hours-v0-84y5fq9syg9g1.png?width=1884&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b7659680bcd5977809d4fd0641eabcee42f1a7f)",

      "text": "Everything is too \"Cute\" I've been a software engineer for 15+ years. I mostly do the boring, heavy lifting - enterprise architecture, big data, petrol/chemistry lab systems. I write Arc42 docs for a living.\n\nBut like many of you, I have a graveyard of unfinished side projects. I'd start, get distracted, and burn out. I looked for a focus app to help me lock in, but everything on the market made me angry. They were all so... *sweet*. Planting virtual trees? earning gems? It felt like they were treating me like a toddler.\n\nI didn't need a game. I needed a cage. So with my uber ux/ui skills I drafted this:\n\n[Napkin Sketch](https://imgur.com/a/VsyB0by) \n\nI went from 0 Android knowledge to a finished APK in about **2 days**. Then I spent **14 days** in \"Google Play Console Jail\" doing the required closed testing. Total time: \\~16 days.\n\n  \n**The concept is simple.** I wanted it to be ugly by design (hahaha sure..) - Neo-brutalist with absolutely zero dopamine hits. It runs on \"Monk Mode\": if you leave the app, you die. I built a \"Penance Protocol\" where failing a session locks the app completely. To unlock it, you have to type self-shaming phrases like *\"I AM A SLAVE TO ALGORITHMS\"* 20 (now 3) times. If you stop typing, the text degrades and resets. It is intentionally annoying. I also hooked into Android Usage Stats to create an \"Instant Death\" feature - if you open a blacklisted app like TikTok during a session, it is an immediate fail with no mercy.\n\napp is searchable as [ZENBLOCK: Monk Mode Focus App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zenblock.app)\n\n\n\n**Transparency NOTICE:**\n\n  \n\n\nI added a subscription option ($4.99) solely because I wanted to learn how to implement RevenueCat and handle entitlements.\n\n* **You do not need to pay.**\n* The timer, the punishment system, and the \"Instant Death\" blocker are free.\n* There are **no ads**. I hate them more than you do.\n\nI honestly just had fun building something that wasn't \"enterprise grade\" for once. If you also hate cute apps and want to be bullied into focusing, give it a shot.\n\n\n\nany feedback is welcome :) \n\n",

      "text": "I’ve built a few side projects over the last couple years. Mostly mobile apps. Some shipped, some died quietly, some are still half-finished in a private repo.\n\nAt some point I noticed something that felt a bit embarrassing.\n\nThe ideas were different, but the first part of every project looked almost identical:\n\n* Set up auth again\n* Wire payments again\n* Add analytics again\n* Make the same basic screens again (onboarding, settings, profile, etc.)\n* Write some messy notes to myself about how this repo is structured\n\nI kept telling myself that this was “just the cost of building apps.” But it started to feel like I was spending the best part of my energy on the least interesting work.\n\nWhat made it click was noticing the same pattern outside of coding.\n\nIn school, I kept getting similar assignments. Essays, analysis, debate prep, research writeups. Different topics, but the structure repeated. The first few times it took ages. Then I started building templates and a process. Not to cheat, just to remove friction. Once the structure was handled, I could spend my brain on the actual thinking.\n\nI’ve seen the same thing in other businesses too. A friend running a small e-commerce thing is way faster now because they have a reusable product page layout, photo template, and launch checklist. Another person I know does client work and has repeatable onboarding, contracts, and deliverables. They can focus on the unique part because the base layer is already decided.\n\nIt sounds obvious when you say it like that, but I was not doing it with my apps. I was rebuilding the base every time.\n\nSo I stopped. I took a weekend and turned my “default setup” into something I can reuse. Nothing fancy, just the stuff I was always repeating: auth, payments, analytics, error tracking, forms, styling, a sane folder structure, and a simple documentation setup so I do not forget how the repo works after two weeks.\n\nSince then, new ideas feel way lighter. I can start building the actual feature I care about on day one, instead of spending three evenings getting back to the same baseline.\n\nIf you’ve shipped a few projects, you can spot this pattern pretty easily:\n\n* You are copying chunks from old repos\n* You have the same TODOs in every new project\n* You keep re-learning the same setup steps\n* You keep rebuilding the same “boring but necessary” screens\n\nThat’s usually a sign you should build a system around it.\n\nI wrapped mine into a boilerplate I now use for all my app ideas. If you happen to be wanting to create a mobile app and want to see how I structured it, feel free to copy: [shipnative.app](https://shipnative.app/?utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=sideproject_long_post)\n\nCurious how others do this. Do you start from scratch every time, or do you have your own reusable base?",

This will democratize it for the £500–£5,000 level consumers, usually students, young professionals. Instead of locking cash in a secured bank account (which effectively earns negative real return due to inflation), you keep the asset invested in an index fund and we issue a credit line against \\~50-60% of the value. It should work for anyone who wants liquidity without triggering a taxable event (selling stocks). The Fractional issue is the hurdle that I am facing as well. As we wouldn't hold the shares ourselves, maybe partnering with someone like WealthKernel or Seccl can work? They will hold the legal title and manage the fractional entitlements for the user. Our layer just places a 'lien' or 'lock' on the withdrawal of those specific assets while the credit line is active.\n\nOpen to other suggestions as well though\n\nWill be a heavy lift on the backend, which is why I’m trying to validate if people actually want it before I go deep into it.",

So you're left with interest, which requires a well tuned credit risk model, and I'm not even sure how you'd build one since they're based off deposits on equities. Btw I think it's predatory to target students who have low financial literacy to undertake not only market risks from equity investments but also incur debt and potentially interest  ( your only source of profit) at the same time\n\nNext you have the problem of volatility. Where are you going to get your liquidity for your users when the stock market drops suddenly? From the wholesale market? How will you explain to your users, who are mostly students that their deposits just took a massive dump? What will you do if people start withdrawing their deposits?\n\nFinally and most importantly.Do you know why credit card offerings are mostly concentrated amongst big banks? Because it's really really difficult and has lots of onerous process. Kyc checks, aml checks, sanctions etc. how will you handle these processes while also dabbling in investment regulations as a startup? The scope of your idea is just too massive for a startup. Have you heard of the consumer credit act and did you know you need FCA authorisation? I see that on your website you mentioned no credit checks, that's not going to go well with the fca consumer duty regulation regarding credit providers. How about section 75 where you're jointly liable with sellers for faulty products? How will you handle the chargeback process?\n\n\nDO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT DO THIS",

Let me rewrite the model and please tell honestly if you think it's still a dead idea: Revenue will be primarily based on a Subscription Model (£2/m for the 'Credit Builder' engine) + Margin Interest (lower than standard APR, but secured). For volatility, we are capping at 50% LTV. If the market drops 50%... well, that'll be a margin call. On Ops, have zero intention of being the Principal firm. Will have an Appointed Representative (AR) model or a BaaS provider (like Griffin or Weavr) who will hold the license and liability. I'll just own the frontend and the customer acquisition. If I have a BaaS partner handling the heavy lifting (KYC/AML/S75), do you think the core unit economics (low interchange + high risk of margin calls on students) make this unviable?\n\nI am fully prepared to kill this project if you still think that it's math-suicide.",

There's a reason why Tesco bank has failed in their credit offering despite their huge team/depth of resources: because mass market lending is just so damn hard. If you're not the principal firm conducting the on balance sheet lending how will you convince your partners to participate in this highly risky business model? You're essentially lending against a volatile assets to students - baas providers will not accept this simply due to the amount of underlying risk.\n\n\nBtw let me ask you something, why should I use your product instead of a secured lending product? I can deposit cash and build credit too, even without undertaking market risk? At the very least I'd target high value consumers and who actually have a problem of having 50k dead capital sitting in cash rather than students with 5000 quid. Even then I'd consider this idea extremely onerous and would rather have them invest in some sort of low risk fixed income product. UK consumer credit act is not a joke, managing a platform that can trigger CGT events isn't fun, and running a financial firm's ops department is a special type of hell. I highly doubt that you'll be able to charge Apr, subscription fees, while allowing students to undertake market risk and accumulating interest while meeting that standards of consumer duty. The rewards for this idea is meh and the complexity and risk is high.",

I'm criticising the overall business model and regulatory problems you'll face based on my domain knowledge from working in fintech in the UK. A better comparison would be Monzo, where many naysayers predicted that it wouldn't be useful to consumers, and then when there were users, that they wouldn't be the primary bank, and when they became the primary bank, that they wouldn't get a banking license. Tom Blomfield talks about this in his 20vc interview.\n\n Guess what? Monzo didn't go into the market with Lombard lending with students because they're not deluded enough to believe that fighting the FCA is a viable cause for a startup and neither should you. Regulation isn't some funny tech stack problem or UX trick or some sort of magic show that a viral marketing campaign can fix.

They provide almost zero value over direct use of an AI service, are entirely locked into their specific use case, are at the whim of whatever low quality prompts the dev injects, and generally are a waste of money even if you want the app's specific use case.\n\nOf what remains, the majority fail because they're \"I solved a specific problem in a way that works for me, with no regard to learnability nor usability\", so in that sense you'd be right. Worth noting that a lot of the wrappers would also qualify for this category.",

The question I always ask is why would I pay for that when I’m already paying for ChatGPT? I have yet to see one that I thought would replace it.",

I've been trying to come up with an app that legitimately provides a value that cannot be achieved via plain ChatGPT and <1 hour of setup and it's been impossible so far. Best I've got is mostly a highly niche novelty that I wouldn't expect anyone to use for more than a couple weeks before just going back to their direct agent. Worst I've got still beats most of the slop round here though.\n\nNo I've not published it, no I'm not sharing details. Until I get something worth anything I'll mention the project solely to dunk on AI wrappers.",
