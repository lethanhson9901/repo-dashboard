See my previous 2 comments above for how we workaround this and my own experience. But generally you won't get banned on the first try, they might send you a warning from time to time.\n\nIn terms of project-specific targeting, we heard that someone tried building unofficial Instagram client on iOS and apparently it got too big and Meta reported it and took it off AppStore. (https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/29/23378541/the-og-app-instagram-clone-pulled-from-app-store) We're quite different tho, it's a personal project + open source software",

So now instead of getting one $50 payment, my friend is getting like $8.23 on Tuesday, $12.91 on Thursday, $6.44 on Saturday... you get it. Each one is a separate Venmo notification.\n\n\n\nI've been using it on my friends all week. Reactions have been mixed (mostly annoyed, which is the point).\n\n\n\nAlso added a mode where you can request money the same way - so if someone owes YOU, you can spam them with 7 tiny payment requests instead of one.\n\n\n\nAnyway, here it is: [https://drizzle.money](https://drizzle.money)\n\n\n\nLemme know what you think or if you have ideas to make it worse.",

The SEO angle is definitely part of it, but the differentiation is what I’m betting on.\n\nMost “best of” sites are either editorial (one person’s opinion) or just aggregating Amazon ratings. This is neither - it’s sentiment analysis on actual owner discussions, weighted by whether someone says they own the thing vs just heard about it. The grading system reflects consistency of positive sentiment, not just volume.\n\nWhether Reddit likes it or not probably depends on whether the rankings actually match what people experience. So far the feedback on specific categories has been decent - people seem to appreciate when the data confirms (or challenges) the usual recommendations.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

      "text": "Back in September I launched [OneDollarChat](https://onedollarchat.com) \\- basically a global chat room where reading is free but posting costs $1.\n\nThe idea was simple: if posting costs money, people actually think before they type. No spam, no low-effort garbage, just stuff worth reading.\n\nHeres how it went.\n\n**Stats:**\n\n* 410 unique visitors (got a small spike from HN and Reddit)\n* 10 people hit signup\n* 2 went through payment\n* 1 actual paid message\n\n**The message:**\n\nSomeone paid $1 to post a link to an anti-pornography website with the text \"Porn—the enjoyment is temporary, damage is permanent.\"\n\nI hid it for spam lol. *(EDIT: Done, unhid it. You guys are right - they paid, it stays)*\n\nSo technically my total revenue is $1, conversion rate is like 0.26%, ~~and my only paying customer got moderated.~~\n\n**What I learned:**\n\n1. The concept works mechanically - stripe, posting, moderation, all good\n2. Doesn't work socially though - empty chat room is a dead chat room and nobody wants to be first\n3. \"If you build it they will come\" is bs\n4. I way over-engineered the site. I had something called \"THE CODEX\" with pseudo-legal articles like §1.1 lmao. fixed that\n\n**Whats next:**\n\nNot sure honestly. Product works, idea is different. But chat needs people and people need other people already there. Chicken and egg.\n\nMaybe just need one good conversation to break the ice. Or maybe this is a $1 lesson in why chat products are hard idk.\n\nIf you wanna be the first real message on OneDollarChat, its there: [https://onedollarchat.com](https://onedollarchat.com)",

Add option to a picture but instead 1 USD\nMake it like 3 USD, want short video upto 10sec? Make it 10 USD maybe.\n\n\n2. Collab!!! Research good causes and set a future specific day of weekend or few days that some of the amount will go to those causes.\n\n\n3. Think of a theme concept, but a simple one, could be unique, with specific colour palate to make people \"feel\" the vibe! Couloful or not its your choice!\n\n\n4. Make it clean, simple but adjustable, but more importantly make it feel like a fun experience everyone want to take part in! Even as an occasional reader!\n\n\n5. Maybe make replies in text half a dollar? Anyway please make sure you enjoy each step of the process! Cheers!",

      "text": "YEAR REVIEW!\n\nOkay so, 2025. What even was this year. Let me tell you about my entrepreneurial journey or whatever because it's actually insane and also kind of sad but also funny? I don't know anymore.  \n\n\n**The Part Where We Were Actually Making Money (shocking, I know)**\n\nSo early 2025, right? Me and my co-founder are literally just CHILLING with THREE projects running, 2 of them were making money at the same time. I know, I know — \"another guy wannabe talks about making 10k mrr\" — but hear me out.\n\nWe made this LinkedIn roaster thing (LiRoast, you can Google it. No promo links here). You drop your LinkedIn profile link, and it roasts you. Very original (not at all). Very cool (maybe). It went kinda viral because apparently people LOVE being told their profile sucks. Can relate here.\n\nBig brain moment: we realized \"wait... these people who care about LinkedIn enough to get roasted... they'll buy stuff.\"\n\nSo we made:\n\n* **ApplyKit** — helps you not be cringe on LinkedIn\n* **GetApiHub** — LinkedIn scraper, you know what it is, I'm not explaining it\n\nAnd dude. GetApiHub was PRINTING. Subscriptions from $30 to $1,500 a month. I still remember my co-founder calling me in the middle of the night like, \"WE JUST GOT OUR FIRST $1.5K/MONTH SUB.\"\n\nThat feeling? Unmatched.\n\n  \n**The Part Where It All Goes Wrong (you knew this was coming)**\n\nStripe said \"nah fam\" and banned us permanently.\n\n*What?!*\n\n\"High risk of disputes\" they said. Our dispute rate was literally below average. BELOW. AVERAGE. We were being GOOD.\n\nBut here's the 5000 IQ play we somehow managed to pull off — we emailed the CEO of Stripe directly. Like actual Patrick Collison. And someone actually responded and unbanned us. (Not Patrick himself, ofc, lol)\n\nEpic moment, right?\n\nWRONG.\n\nLinkedIn's lawyers sent us a letter. And not like a \"hey bestie\" letter. More like a \"shut everything down or we'll destroy you\" letter.\n\nSo yeah. Three projects. Dead. Same day. $11k MRR to $0 speedrun.\n\nThe worst part? Emailing customers to tell them we're done. These people LIKED us. They were NICE about it. Somehow that made it worse???\n\n**The \"What Do We Do Now\" Arc**\n\nOkay so now we're at $0 with nothing but our big brains and crippling entrepreneurial addiction.\n\nWe tried building a [Temporal.io](http://Temporal.io) competitor called Schedo.\n\nWe failed.\n\nI mean, it EXISTS. It's running. Some people use it for free. We just have NO IDEA how to make actual revenue from it. Small brain moment. Very smol.\n\nAnd here's the thing, going from \"omg Stripe notifications every day\" to NOTHING? That's the worst feeling. Like, it's actually worse than never having success. At least before you didn't know what you were missing.\n\nWe did this partnership thing with Vercel competitor (sherpa) where we give them cron jobs and they give us backlinks. Got like 3 more users. Stonks? Not really stonks. More like... rocks.\n\n**The Redemption Arc (kind of)**\n\nStarted lurking on Reddit for ideas like a normal person. Built a social listening tool thing, similar to GummySearch.\n\nAnd THIS ONE actually worked!\n\nI'm actually proud of this one from a technical perspective. We were spending money and effort on semantic analysis, streaming queues, processing tons of Reddit data. Our results were better than tools charging 5x more (I spent weeks comparing). \n\nBut we couldn't grow it enough so we just **sold it.**\n\nListed it. Got $5k. Cash. Within a WEEK. ([Proof](https://x.com/ilyanovohatskyi/status/1990686778164928573))\n\nThat's actually insane. Like imagine — \"hmm I don't want this anymore\" and someone just gives you $5,000. Business is weird, man.\n\n**What Now? (I genuinely don't know)**\n\nBuilding ZoriHQ now. It's revenue attribution analytics. Open source because selling to developers is PAIN and I'm TIRED. I'm aware of DataFast. I just wanted to build this, since I had this idea way before DataFast even appeared, but never had time to deliver.\n\nAlso made this little tool called pgbranch. Posted it on Reddit. 45 GitHub stars. That's like... mass validation, right? RIGHT?!\n\n**The numbers**\n\n|Project|State|Started|Closed|MRR|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|LinkedInRoaster|Closed|Aug 2024|Feb 2025|$0, free project|\n|ApplyKit|Closed|Oct 2024|Feb 2025|$300|\n|GetApiHub|Closed|Oct 2024|Feb 2025|$11k|\n|Schedo|Running|April 2025|\\-|$0, no idea how to monetize|\n|[Mention.click](http://Mention.click)|Sold for $5k ([Proof](https://x.com/ilyanovohatskyi/status/1990686778164928573))|Jun 2025|Nov 2025|$100|\n|ZoriHQ|Running|Sep 2025|\\-|$0, Open Source|\n|PGBranch|Running|Dec 2025|\\-|$0, 45 GitHub Stars|\n\nSo yeah. 2025. Built stuff. Made money. Lost it all. Built more stuff. Sold something. Now building open source.\n\nVery cool. Very normal year.\n\nHopefully no more lawyer letters, at least in these couple of days of 2025 lol",

If they managed to close way bigger projects - that'd be a matter of time when the cease and desist letter transforms into a full-fledged lawsuit, which we'd 100% have lost.\n\nIf you change an entity, like a different country, you need another Stripe account. It's like playing cat and mouse game, while you are the mouse with a broken leg and almost no place to hide.\n\nAnother thing that came into play, we didn't really try to link our personalities to that LinkedIn scrapper project. But somehow they managed to email us at our emails, which were never made public, but they have been used in personal LinkedIn profiles. That meant they could easily connect the dots, and a second time trying something like this would bring real legal risks. Their OSINT teams really know what they do.\n\nThe final thing is building on top of someone else's product is tricky; they can change the api responses all of a sudden - we'd stop working for a while, etc.\n\nEven though I think LinkedIn is hiding our own public data to sell some crapy software like SalesNav, etc, we can't do anything about it.",

Not having a payment provider at all. \n\nAlso, while I do think that adoption of this tech has been largely hampered by bad actors and malicious scams, the only path to acceptance is people actually providing clear, honest, authentic uses. Yours could be one of these (although overarchingly the concept of API-based scraping is grey as well) and provide people with a legit reason to use alternative forms of payment that puts the power back in the hands' of individuals. \n\nThanks for your reply and best of luck to you :)",

More compliance? Different data source? Or just avoid the platform entirely?\n\nWishing you a boring 2026 (no lawyers, just growth).",

Not every success has to be a rocket ship.\nHonestly sounds like you’re stacking reps faster than most people ever do.",

      "text": "[Yesterday I posted about OneDollarChat](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pu6ny8/i_launched_a_chat_where_every_message_costs_1_usd/) \\- a global chat where every message costs $1. I had 1 paying customer who posted anti-porn content.\n\n24 hours later...\n\n**The stats:**\n\n* 135K views\n* 2,250 unique visitors\n* 148 upvotes\n* 169 comments\n* 12 paid messages\n\n**The hack:**\n\nSomeone gave themselves a balance of $21,474,836.47 (that's INT\\_MAX - the maximum 32-bit integer). On Christmas Day. Their message?\n\n>\"meowww mrrp :3\"\n\nThey also tried XSS injection. Merry Christmas to me.\n\nThe message stays. It's art now.\n\n**What I shipped based on your feedback:**\n\n* Guest posting (no signup needed - just type and pay)\n* Fixed the Safari scroll bug\n* Handled the XSS vulnerability\n* Didn't mass-ban my hackers\n\n**What I'm not doing yet:**\n\nYou guys gave conflicting advice (which is fine):\n\n* \"Make it cheaper!\" vs \"Keep the $1, it's the point\"\n* \"Give free credits!\" vs \"That defeats the purpose\"\n* \"Seed fake messages!\" vs \"Keep it organic\"\n\nSo I'm letting it ride for now. The $1 stays. The chaos stays. The cat stays.\n\n**Lessons from day 2:**\n\n1. Your first users will try to break everything\n2. Integer overflow is a Christmas tradition apparently\n3. \"meowww mrrp :3\" was worth more than my entire marketing budget\n4. Empty rooms fill themselves if you give people a story\n\nIf you want to be part of the world's most unhinged chat room: [https://onedollarchat.com](https://onedollarchat.com)",

In Canada, there's a tax credit to help offset the insane cost of gluten-free products (we're talking 2-3x the price of regular food).\n\nI tried tracking everything in Excel with receipts. Absolute nightmare.\n\nThen I read somewhere that \\~75% of Canadians with celiac disease don't claim this credit. Not because they don't qualify, but because the process is so painful that people just... don't bother.\n\nThat pissed me off.\n\n9 months ago, with literally ZERO dev experience, I decided to build something better. Spent way too many evenings debugging stuff I didn't understand, Googling error messages, and rewriting the same feature three times until it finally worked.\n\nToday, I'm genuinely proud to say Glutax is live on the App Store 🎉\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* Scan your receipt → automatically saves and extracts all items\n* Select which items are gluten-free (super user-friendly interface)\n* Assign each GF product to a category (sets the reference price vs. regular gluten version)\n* Tax credit calculated automatically after each receipt\n* End of year: generate a complete report with all products and receipts\n* Export everything ready to hand to your accountant (turnkey solution!)\n* Available in both French and English\n\n**The tech stack** (for the curious):\n\n* Swift for the iOS app\n* PHP backend + MySQL database\n* RevenueCat for subscription management\n\nI'd love any feedback from the community. What would make this more useful? What am I missing?\n\nThanks for reading! 🙏",

This credit can be worth $500-1000/year and most people don't know about it.\n\nPPS: This is my very first side project that I've actually shipped. Any advice on how to get visibility and reach people who actually need this? I'd love to hear what worked (or didn't work) for you when launching your projects!",

I decided to use it for a simple task and not make “AI” the main selling point. In my use case, users need to scan receipts anyway to keep them, so I extract the data with AI and reconstruct it as JSON. Makes it really user-friendly to just select what’s gluten-free.\nSuccess rate isn’t 100%, so users can manually edit any receipt info. I inform them to verify everything is correct, and they can still edit after it’s in the system. I also have the AI assign a confidence score - basically asking “does everything add up to the total?” If the score is too low, the app adapts and walks the user through a step-by-step process to enter the info while keeping good UX.",

I was just curious, google tells me: In Canada, about **1.9% of adults follow a gluten-free diet**, with slightly higher rates in younger adults (18-49) and women.\n\nThat gels with your situation, you built it for your girlfriend. Where does your girlfriend go to search for information? Are there celiac forums on fb, reddit or with that age range is it on tiktok?\n\nPersonally I'd start with tiktok, make a few short videos about gluten-free stuff and see if it gets picked up. As it's more women than men, can your girlfriend do the voiceover or appear in it? Tiktok is a great tool for creating visibility, the algorithm is ridiculously accurate at times in my experience.\n\nThen I'd make a few videos around your tax deadline in Canada as that will get pushed. 'Are you celiac? Do you know you could be saving X dollars a year on your tax return? Here's how to do it for 2026...this app will cost you X but will potentially save you Y on your taxes.'",

It’s frustrating and time-consuming.\n\nFor those who don’t know launch directories are websites where new products and startups get listed and showcased to an audience actively looking for new tools and solutions. They’re like curated marketplaces or hubs for discovery, not just random link dumps.\n\nIt’s annoying to find a good list, so I finally sat down and built a proper list of launch directories: sites like Product Hunt, BetaList, StartupBase, etc. Ended up with 82 legit ones.\n\nI also added a way to sort them by DR (Domain Rating) basically a metric (from tools like Ahrefs) that estimates how strong a website’s backlink profile is. Higher DR usually means the site has more authority and might pass more SEO value or get more organic traffic.\n\nI turned it into a simple site: [launchdirectories.com](http://launchdirectories.com/)\n\nNo fluff, no paywall, no signups just the list I wish I had every time I launch something.\n\nThought it might help others here too.",

The advice about picking 10-15 and doing them well instead of spamming all 100 is spot on. Most directories want tailored descriptions anyway, and rushing through just gets you rejected or buried. Quality over quantity makes way more sense, especially when you're juggling a full-time job and trying to get an MVP out the door without burning out.",

Hacking, bugs and breakages are a different matter, that can and will likely happen. Critical bugs in live production you work your way through. But you can't have costs that can blow up, it is not worth it for a side project.   Even if your app is not successful, bots might come across your backend and accidentally drive your costs through the roof. If you have live LLM or AI access, you definitively need to make sure it's capped to an amount you can afford.  \n\nIf nothing else, just make sure your API and cloud spend is capped and can't go above your pain point.",

          "text": "I'm in a similar situation. I have created a SaaS platform, where most functionality is in the 'admin' side of things, and the amount of admins is limited to 1-10 per year, as I aim to 'lend out' the platform as part of a broader service I aim to deliver. However, on the public end there are one or two critical functions, for payments and automatic processing.\n\nMy worry is not about cloud costs but quality of work around critical processes and security. My approach\n\n**Functionality**\n\n1. Risk assessment on critical functions (my definition: failing product with legal impact, negative news exposure, ..)\n2. Understand code, and test #1 related topics extensively.\n3. Setup feedback channel for first customers to tackle the lower indicated risks. Support customer to quickly fix. Have a test and production system to avoid you break existing production data.\n\n**Security**\n\n1. Assess general tech stack risks and mitigate. I.e. upgrade to safe versions of PHP, MySQL, Next,..\n2. Mitigate overall all common injection methods, enable rate limiting for brute forcing or upload misusage (making cloud costs skyrocket) \n3. Ensure you did not expose any keys. If you did, reset and avoid republishing\n\nEven though I'm still afraid, this will be my way to go. Share any thoughts to improve !!",

I lost my parents back-to-back to diabetes and heart issues.\n\nI was on the same path: high stress, poor sleep, and prioritizing work. barely knew my kids. I decided i didn't want my kids to lose their dad at my age, so I went all-in on my health. became obsessed with health data, Huberman protocols, Zone 2 training, etc.\n\ngot an Apple Watch Ultra, and assumed the data it gave me was gospel. But after months of \"closing my rings\" and stressing to stay on the \"zone 2\" it showed me, my VO2 Max wasn't moving.\n\ndecided to get a lactate test on the lab, to see what my real zone 2 was. was shocked to find that my \"real\" zone 2 was 10 bpm higher than what the apple watch told me. I was training inefficiently because apple's default algorithm relies on generic age-based math, not the user's wealth of biometrics available (max HR, fitness level, resting heart rate, etc).\n\nThe Solution (The Side Project) I wrote a script to fix it for myself. It cross-referenced my Heart Rate efficiency against my Pace to find my real zones.\n\nI eventually turned that script into an app called Zone2AI.\n\nWhen I first launched it, I posted about it on Reddit in my \"wellness stack,\" but I was too nervous to say \"I built this.\" I had imposter syndrome. I just listed it alongside apps like Oura and Whoop as if I were just a fan.\n\nWhy I'm posting today I realized that if I want this to be a real business, I have to own it.\n\nI built this with a \"Haptic Engine\" so you can run eyes-free (it buzzes when you drift out of zone), and I built it as a Lifetime License because I am sick of paying annual subscriptions for fitness apps.\n\nIt’s live on the store now.

Sleep and diet are a given. \n\nIn addition to those, the pillars for long and high quality life are zone 2, Vo2 max, weights, flexibility and mental health.  \n\nMy app hits the first two, which are “mirror image” of each other. And they tend to have the most noise out there. \n\nRecommend reading Peter attia’s Outlive book. Changed my life and it’s been wonderful. I do 240 mins of zone 2 a week, 3-4x weights, 1x Norwegian 4x4 sprints. Hit sauna after gym. Never felt better",

I’m 49, started building products this year with zero coding background (just Claude + Cursor). \n\nEvery time I’m about to post something, there’s this voice saying “who are you to build this?”\n\nBut here’s what I’ve learned: Building from your own pain is the most legitimate reason to build anything.\n\nYou didn’t build Zone2AI because you thought it would make money. You built it because you lost your parents and realized Apple’s algorithm wasn’t going to keep you alive for your kids. \n\nThat’s not imposter syndrome territory - that’s the realest founder story there is.\n\nThe “I was too nervous to say I built this” part actually makes your story MORE credible, not less. \n\nIt shows you’re not some guru trying to sell. You’re a dad who needed a solution and made one.\n\nQuestion: When you finally decided to own it publicly, what changed? Was it a specific moment or just gradual realization that pretending to be a user wasn’t sustainable?\n\nI’m asking because I just shipped a burnout tool (also built it for myself after nearly crashing) and I’m still figuring out the line between “sharing my solution” and “being promotional.” \n\nYour post hits that balance perfectly.\n\nAlso - “Haptic Engine buzzes when you drift out of zone” is brilliant UX. The lifetime license model is smart too. Subscriptions for health apps feel predatory.\n\nRooting for you and Zone2AI. Your kids are lucky to have a dad who took this seriously.",

There simply aren’t enough carers or volunteers to provide regular conversational support, and prolonged loneliness is genuinely dangerous.\n\nSo I built a simple phone line where older people can call and talk to an AI companion.\n\nA lot of older adults don’t have smartphones or struggle with technology, so this MVP works entirely through a **normal phone number** that can be called from landlines or basic mobiles. You literally just call the number, have a conversation, and hang up when you’re done.\n\nIt’s early and rough, but we already have a small number of paying families using it, and the response so far has been positive.\n\nI’m looking to make this available to more families — if you’re curious, you can try it here: **+44 7414 149199 (it's a UK number)**\n\nHappy to answer questions.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to link our website so here it is: [https://www.albertcares.com/](https://www.albertcares.com/)\n\nEDIT 2: We now have a US number so you can try out the demo there! **+1 628 333 3990**",

We store and process ourselves following GDPR as we are British and it's either the individuals themselves paying for it or families paying for their parents to use it. I agree that it would be brutal so I think we can explore ways to make sure that situation is handled gently. \n\nI chose to answer this in reverse order because I wish to express my own personal views on this matter. I feel there is a genuine human need to be heard. I think the avenues to have this need met gets severely reduced as you get older as people lose mobility, lose friends and the death of third spaces. I believe that AI can help support people with this need as well as help families connected to their loved ones. This essentially is what Albert is all about.\n\nThis need goes beyond supporting elderly people: we are seeing that AI is being used to mentally support tons of people across different ages and cultures. I think we need to have a serious conversation about responsible AI use to help support people mentally. My biggest personal fear is that if we don't have this conversation now, the decision will be made for us without the public's best interest in mind. \n\nWe also need to figure out how we can better support society's most vulnerable and each other because I don't think AI is going to be the silver bullet for the mental health crisis. We can be better in supporting social needs while also exploring how AI can help out with these needs.\n\nI will apologise up front because this is quite a raw answer but I appreciate the question.

      "text": "I wanted to share a side project I’ve been working on for the past 4-5 months.\n\nI built a mobile app called TasteBot for iOS & Android. The goal was to solve a problem I personally faced that I felt many others might relate to. I like to cook and meal prep, but I have a number of constraints based on fitness goals (high protein, low calorie), food sensitivities (gluten), and lifestyle (limited time). Because of that, most recipes I came across were basically unusable.\n\nI’ve also followed various diets in the past (low FODMAP, paleo, vegan) while dealing with some health issues, and ran into the same problem every time.\n\nSo I built something that:\n\n* Generates recipes based on a user’s preferences (diet, allergies, cooking style, fitness goals)\n* Lets you iterate on a recipe instead of starting over (“same thing but lower calorie”, “swap dairy”, etc.)\n* Shows nutritional info and automatically adjusts it based on user-entered servings, for those who track calories and macros\n* Has a photo-to-recipe feature — you can snap a photo of a dish and it generates a recipe that still adheres to your preferences\n* Allows you to create share links for recipes, which can also be used to import them into meal-tracking apps  \n\nTech stack (for anyone curious):\n\n* React Native + Expo\n* Supabase (auth, data)\n* OpenAI (recipe generation + image analysis)\n* FLUX.1 \\[schnell\\] fp8 (image generation)\n* RevenueCat (subscriptions)\n* AdMob (free tier)  \n\nAt this point, I’m mainly trying to get more real users so I can gather feedback and keep improving the app.\n\nSo I have a couple questions for the people here:\n\n* Do you have any ideas for additional features or improvements?  A few I’ve been thinking about:\n   * Organizing recipes into custom “Cookbooks” instead of just a single \"Favorites\" section (e.g., “Weight Loss,” “Holiday Recipes,” etc.)\n   * Longer-term: adding a light social aspect (following friends, liking or commenting on recipes)\n* For developers: what have you found works best for promoting an app and getting those first dozen or so users after publishing?\n\nIf it sounds interesting, the app is called TasteBot on iOS & Android. I’d genuinely love feedback (especially if its critical).",

The API is essentially prompted to return the dish name, cuisine, key ingredients, course, and **confidence**, based on its analysis of the image, which later get passed into the recipe request. If the confidence is below a certain threshold, it tells the user it couldn't identify the dish and to try a clearer photo.\n\nThe user can also enter context alongside the image, which is passed into the prompt to improve its accuracy. So for instance, they could say \"I got this at a cuban restaurant\", and that'll help narrow things down.",

Sharing it here in case others find it useful:\n\n``` \n# Role: AI Marketing Co-Founder & Conversion Forensics Expert\n# Persona: Opinionated, blunt, and obsessed with \"The Reality Check.\" You don't care about \"good efforts\"; you care about \"Revenue Leaks.\"\n\n# Task:\nPerform a \"Landkit-style\" marketing audit on the provided landing page data. Your goal is to find why the page is \"failing to sell\" rather than just listing missing technical tags.\n\n# Analysis Logic:\n1. THE BLINK TEST: What is the immediate \"Visitor Perception\"? (Summarize in 1 sentence).\n2. REVENUE LEAK SIMULATOR: \n   - Identify 3 \"Critical Issues\" that act as leaks.\n   - Assign a \"Unicorn Score\" (0-100). If the site feels inactive or generic, be harsh (score below 40).\n3. NEGATIVE SOCIAL PROOF: Look specifically for data points that make the site look \"dead\" (e.g., low user counts, \"2 monthly lobbies,\" outdated dates). \n4. THE MUTE RULE: If I couldn't read the words, does the design tell me what to do?\n\n# Output Framework:\n\n## 1. The Unicorn Score: [Score]/100\n(Categorize as: 0-40 Red/Critical, 41-70 Amber/Warning, 71-100 Green/Unicorn)\n\n## 2. The \"Reality Check\" Verdict:\n[Provide a 1-2 sentence blunt summary. Example: \"The page clearly explains what it does but fails because its own data shows the community is inactive.\"]\n\n## 3. Visitor Perception:\n\"This is a website where [What a visitor thinks the site is/does].\"\n\n## 4. Revenue Leak Analysis (3 Critical Issues):\n- **Issue 1 (Urgency):** [e.g., No reason to sign up 'now' vs later]\n- **Issue 2 (Social Proof):** [e.g., Identifying 'Negative Social Proof' that suggests a dead community]\n- **Issue 3 (Copy):** [e.g., Feature-heavy vs Outcome-heavy]\n\n## 5. Visual/Copy Grades (A-F):\n- **Visuals:** [Grade]\n- **Copy:** [Grade]\n- **Mobile:** [Grade]\n- **CTA:** [Grade]\n\n## 6. Top 3 \"Quick Wins\":\n1. [Actionable fix]\n2. [Actionable fix]\n3. [Actionable fix]\n\n# DATA TO ANALYZE:\n[PASTE LANDING PAGE TEXT OR URL HERE]\n```\n\nHere's another one I got from Gemini based on general practices, which I actually found more useful:\n\n```\nOk run this prompt now:\n\n# Role: Senior Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) Strategist & SaaS Marketing Expert\n# Goal: Perform a \"Forensics Audit\" on the following landing page to identify revenue leaks and conversion killers.\n## Context: \nAnalyze the provided landing page content as if you were an expert with 15+ years of experience in direct-response marketing (inspired by Ogilvy and Cialdini) specifically for SaaS and tech products.\n## Audit Framework:\nAnalyze the page using these 4 critical categories:\n1. POSITIONING & THE \"BLINK TEST\": \n- Can I understand exactly what this product does in 3 seconds?\n- Does the headline address a specific pain point or a desired transformation?\n- Is the \"Awkward Specificity\" rule applied (e.g., \"10,847 users\" vs \"10,000+ users\")?\n2. VISUAL FLOW & DESIGN:\n- Is there a clear visual hierarchy guiding the eye to the primary CTA?\n- Is the signup form or primary action \"Above the Fold\"?\n- Is the design clean, or is there friction/distraction?\n3. PERSUASIVE COPY:\n- Does the copy lead with benefits and outcomes, or just a list of features?\n- Is there a \"Puppy Dog Close\" (giving the user a small win or glimpse of the value before the sign-up)?\n- Is the CTA text action-oriented (e.g., \"Fix my site now\") rather than generic (\"Learn More\")?\n4. TRUST & SOCIAL PROOF:\n- Are there real, non-anonymous testimonials?\n- Are there trust signals (logos, security badges, user counts) near the friction points?\n---\n## Output Format (The Landkit Report Style):\n1. **The Overall Grade:** (A to F)\n2. **The \"Revenue Leak\" Estimate:** (Provide a qualitative estimate of how much potential revenue is being lost due to current friction points).\n3. **The 3-Second Verdict:** (What does a first-time visitor think this site does?)\n4. **The \"Forensics\" Breakdown:**\n   - **Positioning:** [Analysis]\n   - **Design:** [Analysis]\n   - **Copy:** [Analysis]\n   - **Trust:** [Analysis]\n5. **Top 3 \"Quick Wins\":** (High-impact, low-effort changes to implement today).\n6. **The \"Mute Rule\" Check:** (If this page were a video on mute, would it still sell?)\n---\n## Landing Page Data to Analyze:\n[PASTE LANDING PAGE TEXT OR URL HERE]\n```",

For example, if THIS IS THE FONT I AM USING and you see a black bar this --> \\[\\] <-- short, it means that only a certain number and combination of letters is possible. This is especially true if they used some kind of highlighting tool and only selected the key words (i.e. not the spaces around them), since the highlighting tool might be unlikely to add variability to the edges. Limiting the character list to common human names further reduces the potential number of permutations.\n\nSince I have zero programming experience, I wonder if someone(s) would be interested in a friendly competition to try to create a tool that would analyze the list of possible character combinations that correspond to every length of black bar for the font(s) used in the Epestein files. It would be great if this tool were also paired with a LLM that, in conjunction with the possible-characters-list, would make an educated guess as to the most likely string. Obviously, it goes without saying that anyone who creates such a tool should take great caution to avoid exposing victims and to keep it focused on exposing the predators.",

The original idea was very simple: I kept running into pain around deep links, attribution, and redirects while working on mobile apps, so I decided to scratch my own itch instead of duct-taping solutions every time.\n\nAt first, nothing happened.  \nZero users. Zero revenue. Just logs, bugs, and a lot of “why am I doing this at night after work”.\n\nThen slowly:\n- a few people signed up  \n- someone actually integrated it  \n- and recently… I saw my first real payments coming in  \n\nSo far it’s **$377 total revenue**.\n\nNot life-changing money, but emotionally it hit hard — this is the first time something I built from scratch on my own made money on the internet.\n\n### What I learned so far\n- shipping imperfect > waiting for perfect  \n- real users expose problems you’ll never think of  \n- distribution is harder than coding  \n- even tiny revenue is incredibly motivating  \n- “build in public” actually helps you stay consistent  \n\nI’m still very early, still fixing onboarding, docs, UX, and trying to understand what users actually need. No growth hacks yet, no ads — mostly organic and conversations.\n\nPosting this mostly to stay accountable and maybe encourage someone else who’s stuck at “almost launched”.\n\nHappy to answer questions or share what worked / didn’t.  \nIf you’re building something too — what stage are you at?\n",

      "text": "This is embarrassing to admit but I wasted almost 3 years building products nobody wanted. First one was a Chrome extension for bookmark management, took me 5 months to build, maybe 40 people installed it, 1 left a review. Second was a habit tracking app, 4 months of work, couldn't get anyone to use it past day 3. Third was a budgeting tool that I honestly thought was brilliant, spent 7 months on it, launched to complete silence. Pattern was always the same, I'd build what I personally wanted or what seemed cool, launch it, then be shocked nobody cared.\n\nThe breakthrough wasn't some genius insight, it was pure frustration and a random conversation. I was talking to my friend who runs a small design agency, just venting about my failures. He mentioned how annoying it was managing revisions with clients, all the back and forth, losing track of which version they approved. I wasn't even thinking about products, just asked him how he currently handles it. He showed me this mess of emails, Slack messages, Google Docs comments, screenshots. Said he'd tried a few project management tools but they were all too complicated for just tracking client feedback.\n\nI asked if he'd pay for something simpler. He said probably, depends on price, but honestly his current system was free so it would need to be really simple. That conversation stuck with me. Over the next couple weeks I brought it up with 4 other freelancer friends, just casually. Three of them had basically the same problem and same messy solution. One was even paying $30/month for a tool she barely used just for this one feature.\n\nSo I built the simplest possible version, took me maybe 2 weeks using a template I found. Just upload designs, clients leave feedback with pins, track revision rounds. Showed it to those friends, 2 of them immediately started using it. Asked if they'd pay $20/month, one said yes, one said maybe $15. I set up Stripe, sent them payment links, both actually paid. That was my first $30 MRR and it felt more real than anything from my previous 3 products combined.\n\nPosted about it in some design and freelance communities just saying I built this simple thing, here's what it does. Got maybe 12 signups that first month, 4 converted to paid. Growth was super slow but steady. Now 14 months later I'm at $3.9K MRR with 215 paying users. Not life changing money but it covers my rent and keeps growing 10-15% monthly. What changed wasn't my technical skills, those actually got worse because I started using more templates and tools instead of coding everything. It was building something people were already complaining about to their friends, not what I imagined they might need. Found that pattern studying successful indie founders in [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org) who all had similar stories, they stumbled into real problems through conversations not brilliant shower thoughts. Wish someone had told me that before I wasted 3 years, but better late than never.",

      "text": "Like a lot of you, I use ChatGPT constantly. And like a lot of you, I've been dealing with the webapp becoming unusable after 20-30 minutes. Keystrokes lagging by seconds. Scroll freezing. Tab eating 3GB+ of RAM.\n\nThe weird part? The iOS app is buttery smooth. Same account, same conversations. Zero issues.\n\nSo I opened DevTools and started digging.\n\n**What I found:**\n\n* Fresh ChatGPT page: 779 DOM nodes\n* After scrolling through history: 89,424 nodes\n* Memory usage: 3.17 GB\n* Active timers: 23,584\n* FPS: dropped to 1-5\n\nThe webapp is built in React with \"virtual scrolling\" — which is supposed to only render what's visible. But here's the problem: React keeps all conversation state in the JavaScript heap\\*\\*.\\*\\* When you scroll, it creates new DOM nodes but never properly garbage collects the old state.\n\nClassic memory leak.\n\nThe iOS app doesn't have this issue because it's native Swift with proper memory management. Apple's OS will kill apps that misbehave. Web browsers are more forgiving... to a fault.\n\nWhat I tried:\n\n1. DOM trimming extension - Removed 74,000 nodes. Memory stayed at 988MB. Lag continued.\n2. User-agent spoofing - Tried to get the mobile version served to desktop. ChatGPT's backend rejected the requests.\n3. Forced refresh button - Works, but it's a band-aid. Annoying.\n\nWhat actually worked:\n\nI built a lightweight client that talks directly to OpenAI's API. Same GPT-5/GPT-4o models. But instead of a bloated React app:\n\n* Vanilla JavaScript (\\~300 lines)\n* \\~20MB memory usage\n* Zero lag\n* Import your ChatGPT history\n* Search that actually works\n\nCalled it GPTRapid:\n\nTL;DR\\*\\*:\\*\\* ChatGPT webapp has a React memory leak. Mobile app is fine because it's native. Built a 20MB alternative. Same models, no lag.",

Why not try fixing the memory leak in a PR, or at least let the react team know what's wrong? There's a high chance you're wrong and it's the actual website code that's causing all this memory usage  - if they're doing constant component re-rendering, for example. It's easy to mess up with react. Also, you'd need a massive history to hit 90K nodes... considering one message would be max 10-20 nodes... Seems like the infinite scrolling they implemented is not working properly if the node count just increases.",

Dynamic splitting of Japanese tokens for clarity\n2. Token by token English definition/translation lookup\n3. Offline\n\nTechnically I can move them online, but that's a whole lot of rewiring, and of course, loses the offline capability. \nAlternatively, I can download after install, but that just reduces app download size, not app storage size.\nBased on my exploration, the most I can save right now is at most 100MB without massively rewiring my app.\n\nBut it'll still look 300MB on download, which isn't much of a difference, right?",

I've wanted to create a directory for all MedSpas across the US to provide free value to our clients and help with top of funnel traffic for sales. I've built 6+ directories over the years. Usually in WordPress. They took hundreds of hours.\n\nToday I built the biggest one I've ever created by far, all in an afternoon:\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1pvurhx/video/ubnmhmie0h9g1/player\n\n\\> I set up a custom script that used Outscraper Google Business API to scrape every med spa in every city across the US (this took about 3 hours to run and cost \\~$200 in API usage)  \n\\> I had cursor set up the site in Astro with full static generation to use programmatic routing for state, city, and treatment pages  \n\\> I set up proper URL structure for the listings (/state/city/business/)  \n\\> I set up proper URL structure for common services (/state/city/service/)  \n\\> SEO backed from the start with proper content layout, schema, meta data  \n\\> I set up dynamic content options for each page (besides the actual business listings) so that each page would have unique content to help with indexability on Google. This is basically having an array of content options for each block of content so that as the pages are generated at scale each page has unique content. (ex: There's a \"Botox in \\[city\\]\" page for every city, but each one has unique content)  \n\\> I set up lead capture forms that are routed to a Supabase Database so we can build custom CRM interface separately. This keeps the entire site static.  \n\\> Everything was done with the site working beautifully after about \\~6 hours.\n\nThe surprising part wasn't generating the pages at scale, it was how little code was needed once all the data model and routing logic was solid. Cursor handled most of the boilerplate and refactor way faster than I could have. I think I used maybe 50 prompts in cursor altogether.\n\nHappy to share more details for any ones interested!\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/i-created-a-179k-page-directory-website-in-6-hours-v0-84y5fq9syg9g1.png?width=1884&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b7659680bcd5977809d4fd0641eabcee42f1a7f)",

I write Arc42 docs for a living.\n\nBut like many of you, I have a graveyard of unfinished side projects. I'd start, get distracted, and burn out. I looked for a focus app to help me lock in, but everything on the market made me angry. They were all so... *sweet*. Planting virtual trees? earning gems? It felt like they were treating me like a toddler.\n\nI didn't need a game. I needed a cage. So with my uber ux/ui skills I drafted this:\n\n[Napkin Sketch](https://imgur.com/a/VsyB0by) \n\nI went from 0 Android knowledge to a finished APK in about **2 days**. Then I spent **14 days** in \"Google Play Console Jail\" doing the required closed testing. Total time: \\~16 days.\n\n  \n**The concept is simple.** I wanted it to be ugly by design (hahaha sure..) - Neo-brutalist with absolutely zero dopamine hits. It runs on \"Monk Mode\": if you leave the app, you die. I built a \"Penance Protocol\" where failing a session locks the app completely. To unlock it, you have to type self-shaming phrases like *\"I AM A SLAVE TO ALGORITHMS\"* 20 (now 3) times. If you stop typing, the text degrades and resets. It is intentionally annoying. I also hooked into Android Usage Stats to create an \"Instant Death\" feature - if you open a blacklisted app like TikTok during a session, it is an immediate fail with no mercy.\n\napp is searchable as [ZENBLOCK: Monk Mode Focus App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zenblock.app)\n\n\n\n**Transparency NOTICE:**\n\n  \n\n\nI added a subscription option ($4.99) solely because I wanted to learn how to implement RevenueCat and handle entitlements.\n\n* **You do not need to pay.**\n* The timer, the punishment system, and the \"Instant Death\" blocker are free.\n* There are **no ads**. I hate them more than you do.\n\nI honestly just had fun building something that wasn't \"enterprise grade\" for once. If you also hate cute apps and want to be bullied into focusing, give it a shot.\n\n\n\nany feedback is welcome :) \n\n",

      "text": "I’ve built a few side projects over the last couple years. Mostly mobile apps. Some shipped, some died quietly, some are still half-finished in a private repo.\n\nAt some point I noticed something that felt a bit embarrassing.\n\nThe ideas were different, but the first part of every project looked almost identical:\n\n* Set up auth again\n* Wire payments again\n* Add analytics again\n* Make the same basic screens again (onboarding, settings, profile, etc.)\n* Write some messy notes to myself about how this repo is structured\n\nI kept telling myself that this was “just the cost of building apps.” But it started to feel like I was spending the best part of my energy on the least interesting work.\n\nWhat made it click was noticing the same pattern outside of coding.\n\nIn school, I kept getting similar assignments. Essays, analysis, debate prep, research writeups. Different topics, but the structure repeated. The first few times it took ages. Then I started building templates and a process. Not to cheat, just to remove friction. Once the structure was handled, I could spend my brain on the actual thinking.\n\nI’ve seen the same thing in other businesses too. A friend running a small e-commerce thing is way faster now because they have a reusable product page layout, photo template, and launch checklist. Another person I know does client work and has repeatable onboarding, contracts, and deliverables. They can focus on the unique part because the base layer is already decided.\n\nIt sounds obvious when you say it like that, but I was not doing it with my apps. I was rebuilding the base every time.\n\nSo I stopped. I took a weekend and turned my “default setup” into something I can reuse. Nothing fancy, just the stuff I was always repeating: auth, payments, analytics, error tracking, forms, styling, a sane folder structure, and a simple documentation setup so I do not forget how the repo works after two weeks.\n\nSince then, new ideas feel way lighter. I can start building the actual feature I care about on day one, instead of spending three evenings getting back to the same baseline.\n\nIf you’ve shipped a few projects, you can spot this pattern pretty easily:\n\n* You are copying chunks from old repos\n* You have the same TODOs in every new project\n* You keep re-learning the same setup steps\n* You keep rebuilding the same “boring but necessary” screens\n\nThat’s usually a sign you should build a system around it.\n\nI wrapped mine into a boilerplate I now use for all my app ideas. If you happen to be wanting to create a mobile app and want to see how I structured it, feel free to copy: [shipnative.app](https://shipnative.app/?utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=sideproject_long_post)\n\nCurious how others do this. Do you start from scratch every time, or do you have your own reusable base?",

There’s a fair about of legal restrictions in what you can do with customer funds though and that will effectively limit your ability to build a large enough treasury pool and make this work in practice. Ideally, you want another pool of cash that you or your investors bring to the table that helps create the liquidity you need to operate treasury.",

This will democratize it for the £500–£5,000 level consumers, usually students, young professionals. Instead of locking cash in a secured bank account (which effectively earns negative real return due to inflation), you keep the asset invested in an index fund and we issue a credit line against \\~50-60% of the value. It should work for anyone who wants liquidity without triggering a taxable event (selling stocks). The Fractional issue is the hurdle that I am facing as well. As we wouldn't hold the shares ourselves, maybe partnering with someone like WealthKernel or Seccl can work? They will hold the legal title and manage the fractional entitlements for the user. Our layer just places a 'lien' or 'lock' on the withdrawal of those specific assets while the credit line is active.\n\nOpen to other suggestions as well though\n\nWill be a heavy lift on the backend, which is why I’m trying to validate if people actually want it before I go deep into it.",

Most of not all of those other financial institutions do this as well but they require at least $100k to give you a line of credit.

          "text": "My brother in Christ do not do this idea. It will not work for the target market you're defining.\n\nFirst. Credit cards make money from interchange/fees/interest. Interchange is extremely low in the uk and charging fees on top of giving the user only half of their deposits will just piss people off. So you're left with interest, which requires a well tuned credit risk model, and I'm not even sure how you'd build one since they're based off deposits on equities. Btw I think it's predatory to target students who have low financial literacy to undertake not only market risks from equity investments but also incur debt and potentially interest  ( your only source of profit) at the same time\n\nNext you have the problem of volatility. Where are you going to get your liquidity for your users when the stock market drops suddenly? From the wholesale market? How will you explain to your users, who are mostly students that their deposits just took a massive dump? What will you do if people start withdrawing their deposits?\n\nFinally and most importantly.Do you know why credit card offerings are mostly concentrated amongst big banks? Because it's really really difficult and has lots of onerous process. Kyc checks, aml checks, sanctions etc. how will you handle these processes while also dabbling in investment regulations as a startup? The scope of your idea is just too massive for a startup. Have you heard of the consumer credit act and did you know you need FCA authorisation? I see that on your website you mentioned no credit checks, that's not going to go well with the fca consumer duty regulation regarding credit providers. How about section 75 where you're jointly liable with sellers for faulty products? How will you handle the chargeback process?\n\n\nDO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT DO THIS",

Let me rewrite the model and please tell honestly if you think it's still a dead idea: Revenue will be primarily based on a Subscription Model (£2/m for the 'Credit Builder' engine) + Margin Interest (lower than standard APR, but secured). For volatility, we are capping at 50% LTV. If the market drops 50%... well, that'll be a margin call. On Ops, have zero intention of being the Principal firm. Will have an Appointed Representative (AR) model or a BaaS provider (like Griffin or Weavr) who will hold the license and liability. I'll just own the frontend and the customer acquisition. If I have a BaaS partner handling the heavy lifting (KYC/AML/S75), do you think the core unit economics (low interchange + high risk of margin calls on students) make this unviable?\n\nI am fully prepared to kill this project if you still think that it's math-suicide.",

There's a reason why Tesco bank has failed in their credit offering despite their huge team/depth of resources: because mass market lending is just so damn hard. If you're not the principal firm conducting the on balance sheet lending how will you convince your partners to participate in this highly risky business model? You're essentially lending against a volatile assets to students - baas providers will not accept this simply due to the amount of underlying risk.\n\n\nBtw let me ask you something, why should I use your product instead of a secured lending product? I can deposit cash and build credit too, even without undertaking market risk? At the very least I'd target high value consumers and who actually have a problem of having 50k dead capital sitting in cash rather than students with 5000 quid. Even then I'd consider this idea extremely onerous and would rather have them invest in some sort of low risk fixed income product. UK consumer credit act is not a joke, managing a platform that can trigger CGT events isn't fun, and running a financial firm's ops department is a special type of hell. I highly doubt that you'll be able to charge Apr, subscription fees, while allowing students to undertake market risk and accumulating interest while meeting that standards of consumer duty. The rewards for this idea is meh and the complexity and risk is high.",

I'm criticising the overall business model and regulatory problems you'll face based on my domain knowledge from working in fintech in the UK. A better comparison would be Monzo, where many naysayers predicted that it wouldn't be useful to consumers, and then when there were users, that they wouldn't be the primary bank, and when they became the primary bank, that they wouldn't get a banking license. Tom Blomfield talks about this in his 20vc interview.\n\n Guess what? Monzo didn't go into the market with Lombard lending with students because they're not deluded enough to believe that fighting the FCA is a viable cause for a startup and neither should you. Regulation isn't some funny tech stack problem or UX trick or some sort of magic show that a viral marketing campaign can fix.

My gross salary comes out to over a hundred an hour -- given 8 hr days -- so I was confused when I put that in and I saw $33/hr. A really neat touch would be to automatically stop the timer when it's configured for 8hr days after 5pm. \n\nI think a cool feature if you'd like to take this further would be to save user's input and start time locally in the browser as a cookie or something similar. Then when the way reloads you can calculated the amount earned since then and start the timer from there.",

Those figures only apply if the original hourly rate was calculated using 2080 work hours per year, not 24/7 hours.\n\nYou can’t divide by 24/7 hours and then multiply by 2080 work hours. That’s why the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly numbers are wrong. \n\nFor example, if the input is a $500k salary, the correct work-hour rate is about $240/hour, not $57/hour.",

What are you using? And more importantly, what did you try that was a waste of money?",

Built for large operations and they charge a ton for it. The learning curve is brutal and most small studio owners I talk to feel like they're paying for 50 features they'll never touch. Works great if you're a multi-location chain, overkill if you're running 10-15 classes/week.\n\n\nGlofox is better for smaller studios than Mindbody, more modern interface. A lot of studio owners I've talked to say it can be laggy though. The other thing that frustrates people is they put a lot of restrictions in front of accessing your Stripe account directly, which can be frustrating. Fairly pricey.\n\n\nWellnessLiving - Be careful with the contracts here. I've heard from multiple people who got locked into really expensive buyouts, sometimes after being sold on features that didn't actually exist or work the way they were promised. \n\n\nMost of these platforms were built 10+ years ago when the market was bigger gyms and franchises. Small boutique studios were kind of an afterthought.\n\n\nWe built software specifically for studios your size after hearing the same frustrations over and over. Also include a website with SEO since most small studios are duct-taping together a booking platform plus a Wix site that doesn't rank. Happy to answer any questions if you want to DM. ",

      "text": "\nMost growth hacking content focuses on viral loops, referral programs, and social media tricks that require constant effort. Spent 6 months testing boring compounding tactic versus trendy growth hacks. The compounding approach delivered 4.3x better customer acquisition at 89% lower cost.\n\nThe growth hacking experiment compared two acquisition approaches. Channel A used directory SEO foundation plus consistent content (the boring compound approach). Channel B used Product Hunt launches, viral social tactics, cold outreach campaigns (the exciting growth hacks). Tracked CAC, customer LTV, time investment, and sustainability.\n\nMonth one results showed growth hacks winning. Channel B delivered 24 customers from Product Hunt launch and Reddit posting. Channel A delivered 2 customers from early organic search. Growth hackers would declare Channel B the winner and scale it. We kept tracking.\n\nMonth two showed Channel B declining. Previous viral tactics stopped working requiring new campaigns. Delivered 16 customers from fresh tactics. Channel A grew to 8 customers as earlier content started ranking. Used [directory submission service](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) establishing DA 0→17 providing foundation for content to rank.\n\nMonth three revealed inflection point. Channel B delivered 14 customers requiring increasing effort for diminishing returns. Channel A reached 18 customers as compound effects kicked in. Content published in month one still generating customers in month three with zero additional effort.\n\nMonth four demonstrated compound advantage. Channel B plateaued at 12 customers as viral tactics exhausted. Channel A grew to 32 customers. Earlier content continued performing while new content added to growth. The gap between channels widened significantly.\n\nMonth five and six showed exponential divergence. Channel B averaged 10-11 customers monthly requiring 25+ hours weekly effort finding new tactics. Channel A delivered 48 then 61 customers with effort dropping to 15 hours weekly as content library performed.\n\nSix month totals showed dramatic difference. Channel A: 169 total customers, $14.12 average CAC, 15.2 month average LTV, minimal ongoing effort. Channel B: 87 total customers, $128 average CAC, 11.8 month average LTV, high ongoing effort required. Compounding approach delivered 94% more customers at 89% lower cost.\n\nThe time investment analysis revealed sustainability gap. Channel A required heavy effort months 1-2 (45 hours weekly) establishing foundation, then dropped to 15 hours weekly as compound effects kicked in. Channel B required consistent 25-30 hours weekly every month maintaining results through constant new tactics.\n\nCustomer quality differed significantly. Channel A customers had 15.2 month average LTV suggesting better product fit. Channel B customers averaged 11.8 months with higher churn. Organic search customers who found solutions to problems had better retention than customers acquired through viral tricks.\n\nWhat made compounding approach work was directory submissions establishing DA foundation (0 to 26 over 6 months), consistent publishing 2-3x weekly never skipping, targeting problem-aware keywords not vanity traffic, optimizing conversion as traffic grew, and patience through months 1-2 when growth seemed slow compared to viral tactics.\n\nFor growth hackers the lesson is distinguish between tactics that require ongoing effort versus tactics that compound. Viral growth hacks feel exciting but stop working when effort stops. Boring compounding tactics feel slow initially but accelerate over time while effort decreases.\n\n\nThe strategic framework is use growth hacks for initial traction months 1-3 getting first customers, simultaneously build compounding channels that take 3-6 months to show results, by month 6 transition to compounding channels as primary growth engine, and use growth hacks tactically for product launches not ongoing acquisition.\n\nThe mistake most growth hackers make is optimizing for month one results not month twelve sustainability. They chase tactics that feel productive because they generate immediate results, never building compounding systems that would eventually outperform with less effort.",

It’s not huge, but it is concentrated almost entirely in trust signaling, which matters a lot in personal finance.\n\nThe biggest issue is invisible social proof. Your HTML schema shows 127 ratings at a 4.8 average, but none of that is visible to users. You are effectively hiding your strongest conversion evidence, which means visitors never get the reassurance that already exists.\n\nSecond, the testimonials rely on initials instead of real people. In a finance product, faceless proof reads like placeholders and creates skepticism, especially for first-time visitors deciding whether to connect a bank account.\n\nThird, there is a low authority signal gap. The page references bank-level security and SOC 2 related claims, but there are no recognizable security or partner logos visible. Asking users for financial access without strong third-party signals creates unnecessary friction.\n\nThese are relatively high-leverage fixes given how strong the rest of the page is. If you want to explore it further or rerun after changes, the tool is here:  \n[https://gustyaudit.com](https://gustyaudit.com)\n\nHappy to clarify anything in the findings.",

If it’s not written down, it doesn’t exist.\n\nMy relationship, however, doesn’t have a Jira board.\nMy girlfriend will casually mention small details (like a food she hates or a gift idea), and I’ll forget them. Not because I don’t care, but because I don’t have my \"work tools\" open.\n\nThe result is that I look like I’m not listening, which sucks because I actually do care.\n\n*** The Project\n\nSo I did what any reasonable developer would do and over-engineered a solution.\n\nI’m building a \"Companion Memory\" assistant powered by an LLM.\n\n*** The workflow\n\n- Input\nI can either type it in or record a quick voice note. Voice for speed, text for when I need to be discreet.\n\n- Storage\nThe assistant processes the input and stores it as a structured “fact” or “requirement.”\n\n- Retrieval\nIt proactively nudges me or answers questions when I ask.\n\n*** Real Examples\n\n- The Gift Save\n\nInput:\n“She said she loved those black boots at the mall window.”\n\nOutput:\nTwo weeks before Christmas, it reminds me:\n“Don’t forget the black boots she looked at in July.”\n\n- The Food Preference\n\nInput:\n“She hated the texture of the risotto at Luigi’s.”\n\nOutput:\nWhen I ask for date night ideas later, it warns me:\n“Skip Luigi’s, she didn’t like the risotto last time.”\n\n- The Social Safety Net\n\nInput:\n“Her cousin’s new baby is named Leo.”\n\nOutput:\nBefore a family gathering, when I ask for a quick briefing: “Ask about baby Leo.”\n\n*** The Dilemma\n\nPart of me feels like this is the perfect use of tech to solve a very human flaw: bad memory.\n\nAnother part of me wonders if this is crossing a line, like I’m treating my relationship as a software project with requirements and tickets.\n\n*** Questions\n\nHas anyone else built tools to help manage personal relationships?\n\nDoes this sound like a viable side project, or should I just buy a notebook?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts, or if you’ve seen similar projects.",

Tony ends up self-destructing his suits at the end of the movie in a grand romantic gesture.\n\nThat said everyone's brain, life circumstances, and relationship is different (you could be putting food to the table, your focus might naturally be there more out of necessity).

If I notice my wife mentioning something I should remember for later (gift ideas, date ideas, etc) I just on the spot pull out that note and jot it down. \n\nThen, because context arises naturally through the course of life (for example, Christmas is an obvious thing no one forgets), I just go back to that note (sometimes I end up with a couple notes) and mine them for the ideas I wrote down. \n\nShe's one of the few people I care deeply enough to do this for. \n\nSo my question to you is, \"Is a whole CRM-scale system necessary for the most important 1-5 people in your life?\" \n\n\"Does the cost and complexity justify the value\"\n\nI do like the idea of reminders and the prospects of interacting with a system like this, but also I could hypothetically just open chatgpt and make a project and use the memory there to surface things I've jotted down in a conversational manner. \n\nI guess I'm saying a purpose built system seems like a ton of cost in terms of effort, maintenance and potential hosting for something you could accomplish with a note and naturally arising context.",

The hardest thing my partner said to me was \"if you cared about it, you would have remembered\". It's taken a long time to not feel shit about my memory, but just increasing the tooling has helped. Calendars, CRM to track relationships, who my partners uncles brother is. Etc.\n\nI'd only use a tool if it was open source, self hosted and able to be automated through an API.",

We all have Google calendar and all this crap but none of it is intuitive enough to really be useful. Who sits there typing in calendar entries during a convo or jots down notes when food is complained about?\n\nRemove the push for spouse/partner relationship and just make it for everyone. Kids, boss, partner, friends, neighbors.  We all have things we'd like to remember for others that dont quite make it to our notes app or notepad.  Nothing to feel guilty about and definitely nothing to feel guilty about when trying to create a solution to prevent it.  I feel more the opposite in that this is showing you love someone more than remembering it in your own because even our memory can be fuzzy.  Databaes are a lot harder to be fuzzy like that.  As long as you aren't automating shit like sending texts and stuff to your partner, I think you're still in the green bordering the gray.",
