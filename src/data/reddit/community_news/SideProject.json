I have been building with AI agents for a while and the biggest lesson I learned is that the visual layer (desks, speech bubbles, green/yellow status) is fun but the hard part is always the same: how do you know agent output is actually correct?\n\n  \nWith 8 agents talking to each other you get compounding hallucination risk. Agent A summarizes something slightly wrong, Agent B builds on that summary, Agent C acts on it. By the time it reaches you, the error is buried three layers deep and looks totally plausible.\n\n  \nThe things that actually worked for me:\n\n  \n1. Keep agent chains short. Two agents max in a chain before a human checkpoint. The longer the chain the more garbage accumulates.\n\n  \n2. Make every agent write to a log you can audit, not just show a speech bubble. If you cant trace back why an agent did something, you cant trust it.\n\n  \n3. Token costs scale way faster than you expect with multi-agent setups. Each agent-to-agent conversation is burning context windows on both sides. I would track your daily spend closely for the first month.\n\n  \n4. The WhatsApp interface is smart though. Natural language commands with zero prompt engineering friction is underrated. Most agent frameworks make you write YAML configs or chain builders when honestly just texting instructions works better.\n\n  \nThe real question from the comments (what concrete output did they ship) is the right one to focus on. The architecture is cool but at the end of the day it comes down to: did the newsletter actually go out, was the research accurate, did the tweets perform. Would love to see a followup post with actual metrics after a month of running this.",

This quickly escalated into a much larger project than expected, from a time, effort, and cost perspective :). I also managed to archive a lot of the House Oversight committee's documents, including from the epstein estate.\n\nI scraped everything, ran it through OpenAI's batch API, and built a full-text search with network graphs leveraging PostgreSQL full text search.\n\nNow at 1,317,893 documents indexed with 238,163 people identified (lots of dupes, working on deduping these now). I'm also currently importing non PDF data (like videos etc). \n\nFeedback is welcome, this is my first large dataset project with AI.  I've written tons of automation scripts in python, and built out the website for searching, added some caching to speed things up.\n\n[**https://epsteingraph.com**](https://epsteingraph.com)",

I've done similar bulk processing jobs and found that breaking things into \\~50k doc chunks with some sleep in between helped avoid the occasional 429.\n\nFor the deduping, have you looked into pg\\_trgm? For people names specifically, combining trigram similarity with Levenshtein distance works surprisingly well — something like \\`SELECT \\* FROM people WHERE similarity(name, 'target') > 0.6\\` catches most common variations (middle names, initials, typos in OCR output). Way cheaper than running another round of LLM calls for entity resolution.\n\nAlso curious about your scraping setup — 1.3M docs is a lot of I/O. Did you parallelize the downloads or run them sequentially? And what was the split between OCR-able scanned PDFs vs docs that already had a text layer? That ratio can massively affect both accuracy and cost.\n\nImpressive project for a first large dataset + AI build ngl.",

I am happy with it as it is, but if possible to get updates - I immediately noticed a few things:\n\n\\- I understand that the design concept for it is to be monochrome, but at least a few optional colors for cards would help to group tasks\n\n\\- a shortcut to delete the current card would be really useful (CMD+Backspace, maybe?)\n\n\\- a shortcut to \"finish writing\" in the current card and release the focus (or you can call it \"Submit\") (CMD + Enter?)\n\n\\- a shortcut to list all shortcuts (Shift + ?)\n\n\\- some sort of scrolling the canvas would be useful. When I use it full screen, and then resize - I can't scroll to cards that get cut off / hidden. Basically, forcing me to use it the same size all the time.\n\nНу красунчик просто!

It’s called Mr. Slinky.\n\nI started this as a small father & son project, but now I’m trying to turn it into a real product/toy. This is the very first version that uses a motor to keep the slinky moving forever. It was a lot of trial and error to get the timing right!\n\nThe next version will include a small computer (Arduino or ESP32) with sensors to adjust the speed automatically.\n\nMy dream is to create a real product from this. I’m documenting the whole build process and my progress on YouTube.\n\nFollow the journey here: [https://www.youtube.com/@Mr.Slinky3D](https://www.youtube.com/@Mr.Slinky3D)\n\nI would love to hear your feedback or ideas!",

But when you're actually doing it in your mid-40s, that voice in your head says otherwise.\n\nI'm in my mid-40s, starting this ambitious project with great expectations but even greater fear of failure.\n\nAround 40 days ago I committed to building and launching 6 products in 12 months. The first one goes live in about 2 weeks.\n\nEverywhere I look, it's 20-something founders shipping their second or third company. Moving fast, pivoting overnight, building audiences of 50K like it's nothing.\n\nAnd here I am, just getting started.\n\nBut I've been around the block. Built other businesses, made money, lost money, learned a few things about what people actually want vs what I think they want. That instinct matters more than I realized.\n\nThe young founders have energy and speed on their side. No question.\n\nI have something else. I can smell when an idea is already validated vs when I'm building in the dark. I know that trying to compete head-to-head in a crowded space is suicide - you need to carve out your corner first.\n\nThese aren't things you learn from a course. You learn them by screwing up enough times.\n\nStill, some days I wonder if I should've done this 20 years ago. Other days I think starting now is exactly right.\n\nI'm documenting the whole thing on X, Threads and here on Reddit as I go. Not because I have it figured out, but because maybe there are others out there doing the same thing and we can learn from each other.\n\nIf you're in your 40s (or beyond) building something, I'd genuinely love to hear how it's going for you. What does it feel like on your end?\n\n42 days in. First launch soon. Let's see what happens. ",

Most successful startups are founded by middle-aged entrepreneurs. \n\nDespite the popular belief that youth drives innovation, data shows **age is a significant advantage** in entrepreneurship, particularly for building high-impact, scalable ventures. ",

I can smell bullshit product ideas a mile away now - stuff I would've wasted 6 months on in my 20s, I skip in 5 minutes because I've watched enough companies burn money on \"solutions\" nobody asked for. The age thing is weird though. On one hand, I have the patience and discipline to actually finish something (younger me would've quit after Day 3). On the other hand, watching 23-year-olds with 50K followers making $10K/month while I'm at Day 11 with 0 sales is... humbling haha ;) But here's what I notice: the young founders pivot fast because they can afford to fail 10 times. We can't. So we ship slower but more deliberately. That's not a weakness, it's just a different game. Also - you're doing 6 products in 12 months? That's ambitious as hell. Are you validating each one before building or just shipping fast and seeing what sticks? 42 days in is nothing. You're just getting started. Let us know when Product #1 launches!

First of all, you 0 sales is more than normal thing, it is the \"Slowly, then suddenly\" type of thing, once you fine tune your GTM strategy and reach the right audience, then the \"suddenly part\" kicks in.\n\nYou are right, 6 products in 12 months it is absolutely scary, but the idea is exactly the one you've mentioned \"shipping fast and seeing what sticks\", we can definitely not market 6 products at the same time alone (my co-founder and me), so, we will simply dismissed what doesn't work and move forward. At the same time, some of those products are \"boring products\" (not novel ideas, things that already work, are already proven, and have already audience paying for these type of products), so, we are mixing \"novel ideas\" perhaps nobody wants (big risk) that we would need to validate before hand, with proven ideas we know that are already validated.\n\nWhat is your product about by the way? Best of luck",

That's exactly what I keep telling myself at Day 20 now (still 0 sales, still learning). You're right though - I can feel the GTM strategy getting sharper every day. It's like... I know what I'm building is solid, I just haven't cracked who needs to hear about it yet. Your 6-product strategy makes way more sense now. Mixing \"boring proven ideas\" with \"novel risky bets\" is smart as hell. You're hedging without being paralyzed. I respect that. Younger me would've gone all-in on the riskiest idea and burned out by Month 3 haha.\n\nMy product is Memflect - turns your memories into 5-minute audio reflections in your voice (AI-cloned) with music you choose. It's for people who need to process difficult memories but journaling never worked for them. Type your memory → speak a mantra → get back a cinematic audio track of yourself coaching you through it. $3.99 one-time, no subscription. The validation process has been wild. Built it because I needed it (classic founder mistake? haha). Now I'm learning that the people who get it immediately are coaches, therapists, and people in recovery - not the \"wellness TikTok\" crowd I initially targeted. Live and learn!\n\nCurious which of your 6 you're shipping first? And are you doing them sequentially or building multiple in parallel?\n\nGood luck with the launch sprint. 42 days in, you're just warming up. Let me know when #1 goes live - would love to check it out! 💪",

For every one crushing it with 50k followers, there are hundreds that didnt make it. Easy to forget that.\n\n\n\nYou're right - they have flexibility and speed, we have experience and pattern recognition. Different advantages, both valuable.\n\n\n\n4 apps since December, 2 flopped, $200 with 800 downloads from Reddit - thats the real journey right there. Not the highlight reel, the actual grind.\n\n\n\nThe social media part resonates. I hate it too but know I need to start. Building in public feels awkward but seems to be the play.\n\n\n\n\"I've never been so hyped before about something\" - that energy is everything. When you actualy feel it, you know you're on the right track.\n\n\n\nGood luck with the apps. Let's both make something work.",

You gain pattern recognition but lose the naive confidence that makes you ship without overthinking.\n\n\n\nThe survivorship bias point is crucial. For every 25-year-old \"crushing it\" on Twitter, there are thousands who shipped nothing. We just don't see the graveyard.\n\n\n\n\"As long as you enjoy the process - just keep trying.\"\n\n\n\nThis is it. If I'm going to fail (again), might as well enjoy the ride.

I too started late in the game as well, at 45 making my first app. I would caution on trying to launch 6 products in 12 months and instead focus on getting the first one out.   \n\n\nIf you are able to smell out a good idea, then the other big advice I wish someone had shared with me sooner is this, make sure you market and build your brand and network. You will need that for future iterations. Bringing multiple apps in a year just complicate that as your message and vision will be misunderstood by the average person that, if they even do see your idea which is challenging without ads, marketing, SEO, word of mouth, etc, will still wonder if App X from you is different from App Y and how did you make that many and support them. If you focus on one App then they will think of you and then in the future if it had their needs met, will have slightly more trust that you made something for them in the first place. It also allows you to message them in the future with the next launch and get more buzz going.\n\nGood Luck!",

I'm in my early 30s but started my AI journey later than most in the space, and I constantly battle that feeling of 'everyone else is 10 steps ahead.'\n\nBut here's what I've learned: your timing actually gives you an unfair advantage. Those 20-something founders are moving fast, sure, but they're also making a lot of rookie mistakes at scale. You already know how to validate ideas, manage resources, and read market signals. That's not something you can learn from a course or a Twitter thread.\n\nThe biggest mistake I see is people trying to compete on energy and speed when experience and judgment are actually more valuable. You're building 6 products in 12 months - that's ambitious, but I'd encourage you to think about quality of validation over quantity of launches. One product with real traction beats six experiments that never find product-market fit.\n\nAlso, documenting in public is smart. The meta-narrative of 'founder in their 40s building' is itself differentiated positioning. People want to follow journeys, not just products.\n\nLooking forward to seeing what you ship. The fact that you're questioning yourself is probably a good sign - it means you're thinking critically rather than just building in a bubble.",

Let me know if you hit any rough edges, feedback from non-dev users is the most useful for me right now.",

Auto-detects your local instance, no API keys needed. We have plans to make Ollama and local model support first class.\n\n\\- MCP support: PocketPaw connects to MCP servers (stdio + HTTP). So your custom MCPs that process and serve data, those would plug straight in.\n\n\\- Scheduling: Built-in cron scheduler with natural language parsing. \"Every 6 hours, check the latest data and decide if anything needs action\" is a valid prompt. It's not a rigid n8n-style flow, it's literally just prompting the agent on a schedule and letting it decide what to do.\n\n\\- Mission Control(Deep Work): This is probably the piece you're actually looking for. It doesn't just run a fixed pipeline. It takes a goal, breaks it into tasks, runs agents, and makes decisions based on what comes back. So if your MCP returns anomalous data, the agent can decide to investigate further, trigger another process, or flag you.\n\nThe \"autonomous agent that makes decisions based on the data it's getting\" is exactly the use case Mission Control was built for. The difference from n8n is that there's no flow to draw. You describe what you want and the agent figures out the steps.\n\nThat said, I want to be honest, we're still early. This is beta, things will break, APIs might change between versions. The core loop works and people are using it daily, but if you're building something production-critical I'd say kick the tires first and give feedback on what's rough. Early adopter input is what shapes where this goes.\n\nWould be curious what kind of data your MCPs are processing. If you want to try wiring it up I'm happy to help you get the MCP config right.",

Which is not enough. I could split this into chunks with overlapping parts, but still, the summary of the meeting would be far from ideal.  \nRegarding speech recognition.  I tried various models, even bundled Whisper into the app initially.  \nWith Whisper, you need a large model to do proper STT, and it's slow.  \nApple's native STT API is exptremelly good imo. It's fast and predictable.\n\nOne limitation I discovered is that you can't transcribe two separate audio streams at the same time. You def need to mix audio buffers into a single stream. And it also has a 1m length limit for the buffer.",

RevenueCat or even just a basic StoreKit setup with one tier. Ship it with the ugliest paywall you can live with. You can always polish it later but you cannot iterate on something that is not in the store.\n\n  \nThe \"no budget for ads\" thing is actually fine. Most indie apps get their first 50-100 users from a single Reddit or HN launch post and word of mouth from friends already on TestFlight. You already have friends using it daily so you are ahead of most people at this stage.\n\n  \nAlso congrats on the new kid. Sleep deprivation makes everything feel 10x harder than it actually is.

Motivation comes from within, you will go to bed every night after wasting time reading comments when you could have actually done something useful, trust me I spent much time doing the same and it's hard to shake out of it.\n\nMarketing in my view is 90% of the work of launching a business. Nobody cares about your product, until their favorite trusted source recommends it.\n\nYou need something that fits your lifestyle (congrats btw):\n\n* Set up a paid 30-50% commission based referral scheme (assuming your profit margin is not high enough for that) - more coding that you find easy\n* Find and contact people who have an audience in the same niche telling them how much they can make if they refer your product. You can get emails and IG's from youtubers. It's not much work.\n\nI feel this harsh response might help you but if it doesn't was worth a try! GL dude!",

Your child is 10000x more important, then your wife/gf (happy wife happy life) but every time you get a moment, even on the toilet, start to take small actions that directly help you! Even if that means weighing up pros and cons of each of your 3 ideas to begin with so you can decide on the first to launch! I'm interested in how you get on so feel free to DM me later on! It's easy to get overwhelmed! \n\nI just launched my first app i've spent a year coding and when the first paid customers came in, the feeling was amazing and made the efforts worth it! Your site doesn't need to be perfect either! My first customer signed up, then cancelled immediately (I presume to stop his subscription from auto renewing) - but I made a mistake in my stripe cancellation logic so it ended his access immediately with no refund then he couldn't access my app! I stayed up until 4am trying to figure out how to use stripe to give him 1 month access and fix my code! haha thought that may cheer you up as a reminder that things don't have to be perfect, although I do recommend testing your payment logic properly! \n\nCatch up soon! - Paul",

If I use it long term that's great.. if other people use it too, that is fantastic! Adding on a bunch of hustle to try and get it to be famous and profitable is just a distraction from making the next thing",

I had almost the exact same situation — app working great on my own devices, a couple friends using it, and then just... paralysis when it came to actually shipping.\n\nWhat finally got me moving was reframing the problem. I was treating \"launch\" as this big event that needed to be perfect — polished paywall, App Store screenshots, a landing page, maybe a Product Hunt launch. But in reality, nobody cares about your v1.0 launch. Nobody is watching. And that's actually liberating.\n\nHere's what I'd suggest for the new-dad-zero-energy situation:\n\n1. \\*\\*Ship one app this weekend with the simplest possible paywall.\\*\\* RevenueCat + a single \"Pro\" tier. Don't overthink pricing. $2.99/month or $19.99/year. You can always change it later. The goal is just to remove the mental block of \"it's not ready.\"\n\n2. \\*\\*Skip marketing entirely for now.\\*\\* Just get it on the App Store. Real users trickle in from App Store search alone — slowly, but it happens. You'll get organic feedback without lifting a finger on social media.\n\n3. \\*\\*The LLM cost concern is real but solvable.\\*\\* Set a daily/monthly usage cap for free users. Even something like 10 queries/day is generous enough for casuals and keeps your costs predictable.\n\nThe other two apps? Don't even think about them right now. Shipping one will give you the momentum to ship the rest. The \"last 10%\" gets easier every time you do it because you realize the stakes are way lower than your anxiety tells you.\n\nCongrats on the baby btw — the fact that you built 3 working apps with a 5-month-old is already impressive. Most people can't even ship one with unlimited free time.",

I do think screen studio still looks better at the moment. Some differences I noticed:\n\nFrom what I can tell, with [screen.studio](http://screen.studio) they watch where the cursor starts and stops and then smoothly animates a fake cursor in its place between the two points. That's why it doesn't look like a shakey human hand moving it. \n\nThe enlarged cursor goes along with the spoofed cursor overlay, and then there's just a lot more smoothing/easing to the zoom & pan effects. \n\nI applaud this effort, keep going!",

I noticed on an intel mac I had - i recorded the screen via the competing app and click+drag to mark files in the app - had a super long delay, the highlighting rectangle animated in 1sec delay from the mouse.

People will literally give you a 1 star review just to protest the pricing model even if they never tried the app. Switched to a one-time purchase and the tone of feedback completely changed overnight.\n\n  \nYour point about privacy-first being a tradeoff is the most underrated insight here. I went the same route (no analytics, no accounts) and it does feel like flying blind. What helped me was adding an optional in-app feedback button that sends a plain text email. No tracking, no accounts, but you get qualitative signal from the people who care enough to write. Even 5 of those a week gives you more useful direction than aggregate analytics dashboards.\n\n  \nOn the B2C marketing side, the community approach is the way. I found that commenting genuinely in niche subs where my users actually hang out (not spamming launch posts) drove more installs than any ad spend. The trick is that it takes months to compound and most people quit after week 2.\n\n  \n$1.5k in 3 months on a nights-and-weekends project is legit.

And it was always expensive as hell.\nAbout half a year ago I quit my job. While job hunting, started building an Al tool with a few friends. The idea was pretty straightforward. Let ecommerce operators generate their own product images and videos instead of paying insane creative costs. We named it [Pixelripple](https://www .pixelripple.ai/) and the goal was simple. Let visuals do the selling.\n\nFast forward to now. The site is fully live. We are doing over 4k USD in MRR and it is still growing. But at the same time, a buyer came in with a pretty decent offer and wanted to acquire the whole thing. Now my partners and I are stuck debating whether to keep running it ourselves or just sell and move on.\n\nIf we keep operating it, we will need to put in more operating capital and honestly there is a lot of uncertainty. I am kinda worried the pressure will get heavy real quick. On the other hand, we also keep thinking maybe the product is actually worth way more than the offer. But we are not even sure about that either.\n\nThis is my first startup ever, so I am genuinely asking. Should I cash out and go find a full time job, or keep pushing and see where this goes?",

          "text": "$4k MRR and growing is honestly a great position to be in for a first startup. Most people never even get to revenue.\n\nMy take: don't sell yet. At $4k MRR you're still in the early growth phase - if it's trending up, the valuation in 6-12 months could be significantly higher. Buyers know this too, which is why they're offering now.\n\nA few things to consider:\n\n1. What's the multiple? SaaS businesses typically sell at 3-5x ARR (sometimes higher with good growth). At $4k MRR ($48k ARR), anything under $150k would be selling yourself short if the trajectory is solid.\n\n2. Can you keep your day job while running it? If the tool is mostly self-serve, you might not need to go all-in. Keep the revenue flowing while reducing personal risk.\n\n3. Talk to other founders. Seriously - communities like r/selflaunch or even just posting updates here can help you think through these decisions with people who've been in your exact shoes.\n\nThe fact that someone wants to buy it is validation. Use that confidence to keep building.",

      "text": "Quick backstory: I built [OpenAlternative](https://openalternative.co) in 48 hours back in 2023 – a simple directory of open source alternatives to proprietary software. It went viral (100K visitors first week) and eventually grew to **$6,500/month**.\n\nOne problem: **people kept cloning it.** Every week I'd see knockoffs pop up. Same layout, same concept, different name.\n\nAt first it annoyed me. Then I had a realization: **code is not the moat anymore.** With AI tools, anyone can clone a website in days. Fighting copycats was pointless.\n\nSo I flipped the script: instead of protecting my code, I started selling it.\n\nI packaged my codebase into [Dirstarter](https://dirstarter.com), a Next.js boilerplate for building directory websites. Took about a week – 2 days to clean up the code, 5 days for landing page and docs.\n\n**The crazy part:** I got my first sales on day one without posting anywhere. Just added a small link on OpenAlternative and sales started flowing. People had been asking about my tech stack for months – there was already pent-up demand.\n\n**Current numbers:**\n\n* \\~$5,000/month revenue\n* \\~200 customers\n* Pricing: $159 / $199 (started at $97, raised it twice)\n* Still solo, no employees\n\n**What's working for marketing:**\n\n* 30% affiliate commissions (best ROI channel)\n* OpenAlternative as a \"living demo\" of what the boilerplate can do\n* Building in public on Twitter\n\n**Main lesson:** Your existing projects can become new products. I didn't plan to sell a boilerplate – it emerged from something I was already running. Look at what you've built. Is anyone asking how you did it? That might be your next product.\n\nHappy to answer questions about the journey, pricing decisions, or anything else!",

OpenAlternative as a living demo is way more convincing than any landing page could be. People can see exactly what they are buying before they pay. That removes almost all purchase friction.\n\n  \nThe broader takeaway for anyone reading: pay attention to the questions people keep asking you. \"What tech stack is this?\" and \"How did you build this?\" are literally people telling you what they want to buy.

      "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI built a podcast app last year and had no clue how to market it. No budget. No audience. I tried posting on TikTok a couple of times and got like 200 views. Honestly, I almost gave up on the platform.\n\nThen I found a workflow that actually worked. In one week, I hit 4.4 million views. No paid ads. No lucky viral moment. Just a boring, repeatable process built around TikTok slideshows. You don't even need to show your face.\n\nHere's what I did, step by step :\n\n\\# Step 1: Research Your Niche\n\nTikTok isn't one big audience. It's thousands of tiny subcultures. I spent time figuring out exactly where my target users hang out. Not broad topics. Hyper-specific communities that actually care about what I'm building. The more specific you get, the better your content will land.\n\n\\# Step 2: Warm Up Your Account (Don't Skip This)\n\nThis is the most important part. Before you post anything, spend 3 to 5 days just being a normal user. Every day, for about 10 to 15 minutes, search for keywords in your niche. Filter by newest posts. Like stuff. Follow people. Leave comments.\n\nYou're training your For You Page so TikTok knows what niche you belong to. If you skip this step, your first posts will go nowhere.\n\n\\# Step 3: Post Once a Day, One Format Per Account\n\nAfter the warm-up, I posted one slideshow every day. One big rule here: stick to one content format per account. If you want to test videos and slideshows, make separate accounts. TikTok rewards consistency.\n\n\\# Step 4: The Slideshow Formula\n\nThis is where things get interesting. Here's what I learned after dozens of posts.\n\n\\*\\*Your hook matters more than anything else.\\*\\* The first slide has one job: make people stop scrolling. Write it in first person so it feels like a personal story. Make it curious, a little controversial, or call out something your audience relates to. If they don't stop, nothing else matters.\n\n\\*\\*Keep your visuals consistent.\\*\\* Every post should look like it belongs on the same account. I used dark, moody images because they make text easy to read. I pulled images from Pinterest but always edited them before uploading. Pinterest images have invisible tags that TikTok can flag, which kills your reach.\n\n\\*\\*A few production tips that really matter:\\*\\*\n\n\\* Use TikTok's built-in font and add your text inside the app. Don't use Canva or other design tools for this.\n\n\\* Post directly through the app. Don't use scheduling tools. They seem to hurt how far your posts go.\n\n\\* Images with people on the first slide tend to do better.\n\n\\*\\*Reply to every comment.\\*\\* When you reply, TikTok sends the person a notification. That brings them back to your post, which boosts engagement and tells the algorithm to push it further.\n\n\\*\\*Just keep posting.\\*\\* My first 5 to 10 posts flopped. That's totally normal. Keep going. When something finally hits, make variations of that post and double down.\n\n\\# What Happened\n\nAfter one week of doing this every day: 4.4 million views, a growing follower base, and +2000 signups. All without spending a dollar.\n\nLook, this isn't some sexy growth hack. It's manual work. It takes patience, especially when your early posts flop. But it's free and it works.\n\nHappy to answer any questions. Drop them below and I'll try to get to all of them.\n\n!\\[img\\](98orwcamwyig1 \"Analytics from my TikTok account\")",

TikTok (and honestly most social platforms) profile you based on your early behavior to figure out which audience to push your content to. If you skip that step, the algorithm has no idea who you are and your posts just get scattered to random people.\n\n  \nThe reply-to-every-comment strategy is also way more powerful than people realize. I noticed the same thing when I started being intentional about responding to every single person on my posts. Each reply is basically you re-requesting attention from that user, plus the algorithm sees the engagement spike and thinks the content is worth pushing further. Double benefit.\n\n  \nOne question though, did you notice a difference in performance between slideshows with more personal/storytelling hooks vs ones that were more listicle or tip-based? Curious if the format that got the most views also drove the most actual signups or if there was a disconnect there.",

If you ever want to streamline content brainstorming or track what resonates with your audience, tools like pitchit( [https://pitchit-waitlist.vercel.app/](https://pitchit-waitlist.vercel.app/) ) can help organize feedback and iterate faster.

It's \"can you describe what you want clearly enough that something else builds it right.\" The bottleneck moved from execution to intent.\n\nI've been coding for 22 years and I genuinely think the profession just changed more in the last 12 months than in the previous 20. The developers I know who are thriving right now aren't the ones who write the cleanest code — they're the ones who adapted fastest to directing it instead of typing it.\n\nAnd the ones who are still debating whether AI is \"real programming\"...

You need to hold a mental model of the entire system and spot where the AI made locally correct but globally wrong decisions. It is closer to being a tech lead than a senior IC.\n\n  \nThe weirdest shift for me has been realizing that writing throwaway code to test an idea is now slower than just describing the idea and seeing what comes back.

I ask it for a code coverage report for the changes. I ask it to monitor the CI builds so it can fix whatever breaks or fails without me asking.\n\nI ask it to run the vulnerability scan to make sure none were introduced. I have an MCP installed that allows the model to look up component version information and vulnerability information so it makes better dependency choices (it is really bad at this on its own).\n\nOnce everything is working and provable, I ask it to break the changes down into incremental PRs that build on top of each other with incremental demos and tests that prove each PR. The output of the final PR in the chain must match the demo output of the full code original PR. Now the work is in consumable chunks so the team can review it.

I'm building a macOS app as a solo dev and my workflow has completely shifted in the last 6 months.\n\nThe thing nobody talks about is how this changes what \"being productive\" feels like. Before, productivity was measured in lines written or features shipped. Now it's measured in how well you can describe what you want and how quickly you catch when the agent goes off the rails. It's a completely different skill and honestly some days it feels less satisfying — like you're managing instead of creating.\n\nThe 50-file changeset thing is both the superpower and the trap. Yes, an agent can refactor your entire codebase in one shot. But can you actually review 50 files and catch the subtle bug it introduced in file #37? Realistically, no. I've learned to break things into smaller chunks not because the agent can't handle big tasks, but because I can't properly review big outputs.\n\nWhat I've settled on:\n- \\*\\*Architecture decisions are still 100% human.\\*\\* The agent is terrible at knowing when NOT to build something.\n- \\*\\*Implementation is mostly agent-driven\\*\\*, but with very specific constraints in the prompt. \"Use this pattern, touch only these files, don't refactor anything else.\"\n- \\*\\*Testing is where agents actually shine the most.\\*\\* Writing tests is tedious, agents love tedious, and the output is easily verifiable.\n\nThe \"intent bottleneck\" someone mentioned above is spot on. The developers who thrive with AI tools are the ones who already had strong opinions about system design. If you never developed that muscle, delegating to an agent just means you ship bad architecture faster.",

Cloudron, Ploi, and a bunch of Laravel hosting companies proved this works really well.\n\n  \nFew thoughts from someone who's self-hosted a bunch of stuff on Hetzner:\n\n  \nThe 3.8x markup over raw Hetzner pricing is actually very reasonable when you factor in the time cost. I've spent entire weekends debugging config issues on self-hosted projects. If I billed that time at even a modest hourly rate, the managed pricing is a bargain.\n\n  \nOne thing I'd suggest thinking about: backup and migration tooling. The #1 fear people have with managed hosting is lock-in. If you can make it dead simple to export everything and spin up your own instance if they ever need to leave, that actually makes people MORE likely to stay (because they don't feel trapped).\n\n  \nAlso curious about your update pipeline. Are you doing blue-green deploys or just updating in place? Because OpenClaw has been moving fast and breaking changes aren't exactly confidence inspiring if you're running it for business use on WhatsApp/Slack.",

But I get that \"you can do it manually\" isn't the same as \"here's a button.\" Proper export/import tooling is on the list. So you can leave easily, but also bring an existing OpenClaw setup in without starting from scratch. The goal is exactly what you said: make leaving easy so people don't feel trapped.\n\n**Updates:** In-place, not blue-green. Blue-green would mean running two instances per customer which kills the economics at these price points. What I do instead is test updates on my own instances first, wait a few days for obvious breakage, then roll out to customers. Not bulletproof, but OpenClaw's been pretty stable lately. If something does break, I'm usually fixing it before most people notice.\n\nFor business-critical stuff on WhatsApp/Slack, customers will soon be able to disable auto-updates directly in their instance. Pin to a known-good version and update only when you're ready.",

My Reddit karma scanner job silently failed for 3 days because I fat-fingered a config update. No errors, just... silence. Took me forever to realize it wasn't Reddit's API being flaky.\n\nQuick question: Does your managed hosting include monitoring/alerting for when jobs stop firing? That's the gap I keep running into with self-hosted -- I only know something broke when I manually check or someone (well, me) notices missing outputs.\n\nAlso curious about the upgrade path -- if someone starts on €19 tier and their cron jobs start hitting rate limits, is migration to higher tier seamless or does it require reconfiguration?\n\nThe Telegram/WhatsApp/Discord integrations out of the box is smart positioning.
