This quickly escalated into a much larger project than expected, from a time, effort, and cost perspective :). I also managed to archive a lot of the House Oversight committee's documents, including from the epstein estate.\n\nI scraped everything, ran it through OpenAI's batch API, and built a full-text search with network graphs leveraging PostgreSQL full text search.\n\nNow at 1,317,893 documents indexed with 238,163 people identified (lots of dupes, working on deduping these now). I'm also currently importing non PDF data (like videos etc). \n\nFeedback is welcome, this is my first large dataset project with AI.  I've written tons of automation scripts in python, and built out the website for searching, added some caching to speed things up.\n\n[**https://epsteingraph.com**](https://epsteingraph.com)",

For people names specifically, combining trigram similarity with Levenshtein distance works surprisingly well — something like \\`SELECT \\* FROM people WHERE similarity(name, 'target') > 0.6\\` catches most common variations (middle names, initials, typos in OCR output). Way cheaper than running another round of LLM calls for entity resolution.\n\nAlso curious about your scraping setup — 1.3M docs is a lot of I/O. Did you parallelize the downloads or run them sequentially? And what was the split between OCR-able scanned PDFs vs docs that already had a text layer? That ratio can massively affect both accuracy and cost.\n\nImpressive project for a first large dataset + AI build ngl.",

I am happy with it as it is, but if possible to get updates - I immediately noticed a few things:\n\n\\- I understand that the design concept for it is to be monochrome, but at least a few optional colors for cards would help to group tasks\n\n\\- a shortcut to delete the current card would be really useful (CMD+Backspace, maybe?)\n\n\\- a shortcut to \"finish writing\" in the current card and release the focus (or you can call it \"Submit\") (CMD + Enter?)\n\n\\- a shortcut to list all shortcuts (Shift + ?)\n\n\\- some sort of scrolling the canvas would be useful. When I use it full screen, and then resize - I can't scroll to cards that get cut off / hidden. Basically, forcing me to use it the same size all the time.\n\nНу красунчик просто!

This is the very first version that uses a motor to keep the slinky moving forever. It was a lot of trial and error to get the timing right!\n\nThe next version will include a small computer (Arduino or ESP32) with sensors to adjust the speed automatically.\n\nMy dream is to create a real product from this.

But when you're actually doing it in your mid-40s, that voice in your head says otherwise.\n\nI'm in my mid-40s, starting this ambitious project with great expectations but even greater fear of failure.\n\nAround 40 days ago I committed to building and launching 6 products in 12 months. The first one goes live in about 2 weeks.\n\nEverywhere I look, it's 20-something founders shipping their second or third company. Moving fast, pivoting overnight, building audiences of 50K like it's nothing.\n\nAnd here I am, just getting started.\n\nBut I've been around the block. Built other businesses, made money, lost money, learned a few things about what people actually want vs what I think they want. That instinct matters more than I realized.\n\nThe young founders have energy and speed on their side. No question.\n\nI have something else. I can smell when an idea is already validated vs when I'm building in the dark. I know that trying to compete head-to-head in a crowded space is suicide - you need to carve out your corner first.\n\nThese aren't things you learn from a course. You learn them by screwing up enough times.\n\nStill, some days I wonder if I should've done this 20 years ago. Other days I think starting now is exactly right.\n\nI'm documenting the whole thing on X, Threads and here on Reddit as I go. Not because I have it figured out, but because maybe there are others out there doing the same thing and we can learn from each other.\n\nIf you're in your 40s (or beyond) building something, I'd genuinely love to hear how it's going for you. What does it feel like on your end?\n\n42 days in. First launch soon. Let's see what happens. ",

Most successful startups are founded by middle-aged entrepreneurs. \n\nDespite the popular belief that youth drives innovation, data shows **age is a significant advantage** in entrepreneurship, particularly for building high-impact, scalable ventures. ",

I can smell bullshit product ideas a mile away now - stuff I would've wasted 6 months on in my 20s, I skip in 5 minutes because I've watched enough companies burn money on \"solutions\" nobody asked for. The age thing is weird though. On one hand, I have the patience and discipline to actually finish something (younger me would've quit after Day 3). On the other hand, watching 23-year-olds with 50K followers making $10K/month while I'm at Day 11 with 0 sales is... humbling haha ;) But here's what I notice: the young founders pivot fast because they can afford to fail 10 times. We can't. So we ship slower but more deliberately. That's not a weakness, it's just a different game. Also - you're doing 6 products in 12 months? That's ambitious as hell. Are you validating each one before building or just shipping fast and seeing what sticks? 42 days in is nothing. You're just getting started. Let us know when Product #1 launches! Congrats on taking this leap btw! 💪👏",

At the same time, some of those products are \"boring products\" (not novel ideas, things that already work, are already proven, and have already audience paying for these type of products), so, we are mixing \"novel ideas\" perhaps nobody wants (big risk) that we would need to validate before hand, with proven ideas we know that are already validated.\n\nWhat is your product about by the way?

That's exactly what I keep telling myself at Day 20 now (still 0 sales, still learning). You're right though - I can feel the GTM strategy getting sharper every day. It's like... I know what I'm building is solid, I just haven't cracked who needs to hear about it yet. Your 6-product strategy makes way more sense now. Mixing \"boring proven ideas\" with \"novel risky bets\" is smart as hell. You're hedging without being paralyzed. I respect that. Younger me would've gone all-in on the riskiest idea and burned out by Month 3 haha.\n\nMy product is Memflect - turns your memories into 5-minute audio reflections in your voice (AI-cloned) with music you choose. It's for people who need to process difficult memories but journaling never worked for them. Type your memory → speak a mantra → get back a cinematic audio track of yourself coaching you through it. $3.99 one-time, no subscription. The validation process has been wild. Built it because I needed it (classic founder mistake? haha). Now I'm learning that the people who get it immediately are coaches, therapists, and people in recovery - not the \"wellness TikTok\" crowd I initially targeted. Live and learn!\n\nCurious which of your 6 you're shipping first? And are you doing them sequentially or building multiple in parallel?\n\nGood luck with the launch sprint. 42 days in, you're just warming up.

I too started late in the game as well, at 45 making my first app. I would caution on trying to launch 6 products in 12 months and instead focus on getting the first one out.   \n\n\nIf you are able to smell out a good idea, then the other big advice I wish someone had shared with me sooner is this, make sure you market and build your brand and network. You will need that for future iterations. Bringing multiple apps in a year just complicate that as your message and vision will be misunderstood by the average person that, if they even do see your idea which is challenging without ads, marketing, SEO, word of mouth, etc, will still wonder if App X from you is different from App Y and how did you make that many and support them. If you focus on one App then they will think of you and then in the future if it had their needs met, will have slightly more trust that you made something for them in the first place. It also allows you to message them in the future with the next launch and get more buzz going.\n\nGood Luck!",

Those 20-something founders are moving fast, sure, but they're also making a lot of rookie mistakes at scale. You already know how to validate ideas, manage resources, and read market signals. That's not something you can learn from a course or a Twitter thread.\n\nThe biggest mistake I see is people trying to compete on energy and speed when experience and judgment are actually more valuable. You're building 6 products in 12 months - that's ambitious, but I'd encourage you to think about quality of validation over quantity of launches. One product with real traction beats six experiments that never find product-market fit.\n\nAlso, documenting in public is smart. The meta-narrative of 'founder in their 40s building' is itself differentiated positioning. People want to follow journeys, not just products.\n\nLooking forward to seeing what you ship. The fact that you're questioning yourself is probably a good sign - it means you're thinking critically rather than just building in a bubble.",

Limited context window.   \nIf you have a large meeting, like 1h or something, the transcript is relatively big and can't fit in the single request. You are limited to 4k of tokens roughly. Which is not enough. I could split this into chunks with overlapping parts, but still, the summary of the meeting would be far from ideal.  \nRegarding speech recognition.  I tried various models, even bundled Whisper into the app initially.  \nWith Whisper, you need a large model to do proper STT, and it's slow.  \nApple's native STT API is exptremelly good imo. It's fast and predictable.\n\nOne limitation I discovered is that you can't transcribe two separate audio streams at the same time. You def need to mix audio buffers into a single stream. And it also has a 1m length limit for the buffer.",

The one you personally use the most. Ignore the other two completely for now. Then give yourself one single evening to just slap in the simplest possible paywall. It does not have to be perfect. RevenueCat or even just a basic StoreKit setup with one tier. Ship it with the ugliest paywall you can live with. You can always polish it later but you cannot iterate on something that is not in the store.\n\n  \nThe \"no budget for ads\" thing is actually fine. Most indie apps get their first 50-100 users from a single Reddit or HN launch post and word of mouth from friends already on TestFlight. You already have friends using it daily so you are ahead of most people at this stage.\n\n  \nAlso congrats on the new kid. Sleep deprivation makes everything feel 10x harder than it actually is. The fact that you built three apps with a 5 month old is already impressive. Just ship one.",

Without knowing more about the products, a few things come to mind:\n\n1) your title says you're sitting on 3 finished apps but i would argue its 0 finished, 3 unfinished\n\n2) ask your friends to pay (and not out of friendship). If the answer is no maybe its signal that its not as useful as you think. If the answer is yes then lean in more\n\n3) focus on getting. one to 100% instead of juggling 3. The context switching is probably contributing to your exhaustion as well  \n  \nMaybe to frame the perspective a little differently -> You believe in the potential of your apps. If tomorrow you started to see signups and some extra lunch money trickle in from one of these apps, would THAT motivate you to keep working on it? If so, don't you want to see if you're right? \n\nBest of luck from a fellow builder :) ",

          "text": "Man, I feel this deeply. I had almost the exact same situation — app working great on my own devices, a couple friends using it, and then just... paralysis when it came to actually shipping.\n\nWhat finally got me moving was reframing the problem. I was treating \"launch\" as this big event that needed to be perfect — polished paywall, App Store screenshots, a landing page, maybe a Product Hunt launch. But in reality, nobody cares about your v1.0 launch. Nobody is watching. And that's actually liberating.\n\nHere's what I'd suggest for the new-dad-zero-energy situation:\n\n1. \\*\\*Ship one app this weekend with the simplest possible paywall.\\*\\* RevenueCat + a single \"Pro\" tier. Don't overthink pricing. $2.99/month or $19.99/year. You can always change it later. The goal is just to remove the mental block of \"it's not ready.\"\n\n2. \\*\\*Skip marketing entirely for now.\\*\\* Just get it on the App Store. Real users trickle in from App Store search alone — slowly, but it happens. You'll get organic feedback without lifting a finger on social media.\n\n3. \\*\\*The LLM cost concern is real but solvable.\\*\\* Set a daily/monthly usage cap for free users. Even something like 10 queries/day is generous enough for casuals and keeps your costs predictable.\n\nThe other two apps? Don't even think about them right now. Shipping one will give you the momentum to ship the rest. The \"last 10%\" gets easier every time you do it because you realize the stakes are way lower than your anxiety tells you.\n\nCongrats on the baby btw — the fact that you built 3 working apps with a 5-month-old is already impressive. Most people can't even ship one with unlimited free time.",

People will literally give you a 1 star review just to protest the pricing model even if they never tried the app. Switched to a one-time purchase and the tone of feedback completely changed overnight.\n\n  \nYour point about privacy-first being a tradeoff is the most underrated insight here. I went the same route (no analytics, no accounts) and it does feel like flying blind. What helped me was adding an optional in-app feedback button that sends a plain text email. No tracking, no accounts, but you get qualitative signal from the people who care enough to write. Even 5 of those a week gives you more useful direction than aggregate analytics dashboards.\n\n  \nOn the B2C marketing side, the community approach is the way. I found that commenting genuinely in niche subs where my users actually hang out (not spamming launch posts) drove more installs than any ad spend. The trick is that it takes months to compound and most people quit after week 2.\n\n  \n$1.5k in 3 months on a nights-and-weekends project is legit. The people who call that small usually have never shipped anything themselves.",

      "text": "I used to work at an ad agency, and one thing I kept seeing was how many ecommerce brands needed legit people to make ad creatives. And it was always expensive as hell.\nAbout half a year ago I quit my job. While job hunting, started building an Al tool with a few friends. The idea was pretty straightforward. Let ecommerce operators generate their own product images and videos instead of paying insane creative costs. We named it [Pixelripple](https://www .pixelripple.ai/) and the goal was simple. Let visuals do the selling.\n\nFast forward to now. The site is fully live. We are doing over 4k USD in MRR and it is still growing. But at the same time, a buyer came in with a pretty decent offer and wanted to acquire the whole thing. Now my partners and I are stuck debating whether to keep running it ourselves or just sell and move on.\n\nIf we keep operating it, we will need to put in more operating capital and honestly there is a lot of uncertainty. I am kinda worried the pressure will get heavy real quick. On the other hand, we also keep thinking maybe the product is actually worth way more than the offer. But we are not even sure about that either.\n\nThis is my first startup ever, so I am genuinely asking. Should I cash out and go find a full time job, or keep pushing and see where this goes?",

          "text": "$4k MRR and growing is honestly a great position to be in for a first startup. Most people never even get to revenue.\n\nMy take: don't sell yet. At $4k MRR you're still in the early growth phase - if it's trending up, the valuation in 6-12 months could be significantly higher. Buyers know this too, which is why they're offering now.\n\nA few things to consider:\n\n1. What's the multiple? SaaS businesses typically sell at 3-5x ARR (sometimes higher with good growth). At $4k MRR ($48k ARR), anything under $150k would be selling yourself short if the trajectory is solid.\n\n2. Can you keep your day job while running it? If the tool is mostly self-serve, you might not need to go all-in. Keep the revenue flowing while reducing personal risk.\n\n3. Talk to other founders. Seriously - communities like r/selflaunch or even just posting updates here can help you think through these decisions with people who've been in your exact shoes.\n\nThe fact that someone wants to buy it is validation.

The bit I haven't solved is timed orchestration - periodic prompts to the llm to trigger an agent process. If this was n8n I'd have scheduling - but I want something far more flexible than a set flow. I think I need something like this to sit over the top and make decisions based on the data it's getting.

Auto-detects your local instance, no API keys needed. We have plans to make Ollama and local model support first class.\n\n\\- MCP support: PocketPaw connects to MCP servers (stdio + HTTP). So your custom MCPs that process and serve data, those would plug straight in.\n\n\\- Scheduling: Built-in cron scheduler with natural language parsing. \"Every 6 hours, check the latest data and decide if anything needs action\" is a valid prompt. It's not a rigid n8n-style flow, it's literally just prompting the agent on a schedule and letting it decide what to do.\n\n\\- Mission Control(Deep Work): This is probably the piece you're actually looking for. It doesn't just run a fixed pipeline. It takes a goal, breaks it into tasks, runs agents, and makes decisions based on what comes back. So if your MCP returns anomalous data, the agent can decide to investigate further, trigger another process, or flag you.\n\nThe \"autonomous agent that makes decisions based on the data it's getting\" is exactly the use case Mission Control was built for. The difference from n8n is that there's no flow to draw. You describe what you want and the agent figures out the steps.\n\nThat said, I want to be honest, we're still early. This is beta, things will break, APIs might change between versions. The core loop works and people are using it daily, but if you're building something production-critical I'd say kick the tires first and give feedback on what's rough. Early adopter input is what shapes where this goes.\n\nWould be curious what kind of data your MCPs are processing. If you want to try wiring it up I'm happy to help you get the MCP config right.",

No registration, No email.\n\nIt currently supports 10 languages: English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, German, French, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian.\n\nLanguage detection is automatic, so you don’t need to manually pick the transcription language.\n\nIf you’re curious about the stack:\n\n• nextjs, react  \n• Front Cloudflare Worker  \n• GPU L4\n\nI’d really love feedback—what works, what doesn’t, and what you’d like to see next.

Launched today: [clawhosters.com](http://clawhosters.com)\n\nWhat it is:\n\n• Managed OpenClaw hosting on Hetzner  \n• €19/mo for the basic tier, goes up to €59 for heavier workloads  \n• Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Slack  \n• BYOK (bring your own Anthropic/OpenAI key for now)  \n• Full SSH access, you own your data  \n• Auto-updates, I handle the maintenance\n\nWhat it's not:\n\n• Not trying to compete with self-hosting. If you enjoy managing your own VPS, keep doing that  \n• Not a locked-down black box. You get root access\n\nTook me a while to get the deployment pipeline right but it's finally at a point where I'm not embarrassed to share it.\n\nIf anyone's interested or has questions, happy to answer.

Cloudron, Ploi, and a bunch of Laravel hosting companies proved this works really well.\n\n  \nFew thoughts from someone who's self-hosted a bunch of stuff on Hetzner:\n\n  \nThe 3.8x markup over raw Hetzner pricing is actually very reasonable when you factor in the time cost. I've spent entire weekends debugging config issues on self-hosted projects. If I billed that time at even a modest hourly rate, the managed pricing is a bargain.\n\n  \nOne thing I'd suggest thinking about: backup and migration tooling. The #1 fear people have with managed hosting is lock-in. If you can make it dead simple to export everything and spin up your own instance if they ever need to leave, that actually makes people MORE likely to stay (because they don't feel trapped).\n\n  \nAlso curious about your update pipeline. Are you doing blue-green deploys or just updating in place? Because OpenClaw has been moving fast and breaking changes aren't exactly confidence inspiring if you're running it for business use on WhatsApp/Slack.",

But I get that \"you can do it manually\" isn't the same as \"here's a button.\" Proper export/import tooling is on the list. So you can leave easily, but also bring an existing OpenClaw setup in without starting from scratch. The goal is exactly what you said: make leaving easy so people don't feel trapped.\n\n**Updates:** In-place, not blue-green. Blue-green would mean running two instances per customer which kills the economics at these price points. What I do instead is test updates on my own instances first, wait a few days for obvious breakage, then roll out to customers. Not bulletproof, but OpenClaw's been pretty stable lately. If something does break, I'm usually fixing it before most people notice.\n\nFor business-critical stuff on WhatsApp/Slack, customers will soon be able to disable auto-updates directly in their instance.

I'm running OpenClaw for my startup's automation (Reddit engagement, content workflows, cron jobs), and even though I'm the only user, I've still managed to break it twice in ways that required SSH debugging at weird hours.\n\nThe \"explain why your bot stopped responding at 11pm on a Saturday\" part hits home. My Reddit karma scanner job silently failed for 3 days because I fat-fingered a config update. No errors, just... silence. Took me forever to realize it wasn't Reddit's API being flaky.\n\nQuick question: Does your managed hosting include monitoring/alerting for when jobs stop firing? That's the gap I keep running into with self-hosted -- I only know something broke when I manually check or someone (well, me) notices missing outputs.\n\nAlso curious about the upgrade path -- if someone starts on €19 tier and their cron jobs start hitting rate limits, is migration to higher tier seamless or does it require reconfiguration?\n\nThe Telegram/WhatsApp/Discord integrations out of the box is smart positioning. That's the first question anyone asks when I mention OpenClaw: \"Does it work with [my chat app]?\"",

Probably a daily digest email to start, real-time notifications later.\n\nTier upgrades: also planned to be seamless, not built yet. Right now it's manual through me. Same instance, I resize the VPS, your config and memory stay put. Few minutes downtime for the reboot.

I'd be curious how you handle the signal-to-noise ratio though. Reddit complaints can be vocal minorities, or sometimes people complaining about the same thing in different ways. Do you do any deduplication or clustering before feeding it to Claude?\n\nOne thing that's helped me is combining complaint data with \"workaround analysis\" - looking at what hacky solutions people have cobbled together. That usually reveals what they really need vs. what they say they need.\n\nGreat execution on this. The JSON export feature makes it way more useful than just a searchable database.",

You need to hold a mental model of the entire system and spot where the AI made locally correct but globally wrong decisions. It is closer to being a tech lead than a senior IC.\n\n  \nThe weirdest shift for me has been realizing that writing throwaway code to test an idea is now slower than just describing the idea and seeing what comes back.

I have an MCP installed that allows the model to look up component version information and vulnerability information so it makes better dependency choices (it is really bad at this on its own).\n\nOnce everything is working and provable, I ask it to break the changes down into incremental PRs that build on top of each other with incremental demos and tests that prove each PR.

It's a completely different skill and honestly some days it feels less satisfying — like you're managing instead of creating.\n\nThe 50-file changeset thing is both the superpower and the trap.
