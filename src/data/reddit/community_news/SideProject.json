      "text": "Hi everyone, I made this thing:\n\n[ https://letmewatchnow.com ](https://letmewatchnow.com)\n\nContext: my father’s main way of communicating with our family in 2025 is sending TikTok links on WhatsApp. No messages, no explanation, just TikToks.\n\nUsually links like this:\n\n[https://vm.tiktok.com/ZN..RjeH..Ug/](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZN..RjeH..Ug/)\n\nI love him, but I really don’t want the TikTok app on my phone.\n\nEvery time I open one of those links on my phone it’s:\n\n“Open in app”\n\n“No”\n\n“Install app”\n\n“No”\n\n“Are you sure?”\n\nYes. Very sure. I know I can watch them on the browser.\n\nSo out of mild frustration, I vibe-coded LetMeWatchNow in a short session.\n\nWhat it does:\n\n•\tPaste a link and it opens the video directly in the browser, because if you erase the search parameter, you can watch on the browser. I automated that.\n\n•\tWorks with TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts and X\n\n•\tNo app, no account, no login walls\n\n•\tCleans URLs by removing tracking parameters\n\n•\tExpands short links so you can see the real destination\n\n\\------------------\n\nThis was also an excuse to try PostHog. Tracking is minimal and only enabled if you accept cookies. No personal data, just basic “did this feature get used” events so I know what breaks or what nobody touches. If you don’t accept cookies, nothing runs.\n\nAlso, English is not my first language, so sorry in advance for any weird phrasing or translation mistakes.\n\nIf you try it, feedback is very welcome. Weird edge cases, or “this doesn’t work” comments help a lot.\n\nThere’s also a Ko-fi link if you want to help with server costs, but it’s completely optional and the site will stay free anyway.\n\nThat’s all.\n\nHappy New Year!\n\n————-\n\nUpdate: Thank you so much for the support and feedback! 💚💚💚\n\nI've already implemented one of your suggested features: iOS Shortcuts (Automation) support! 🚀\n\nYou can now create a \"one-tap\" workflow: when you share a link from WhatsApp/Instagram, the shortcut automatically opens LetMeWatchNow with the link already pasted and sanitized. Then you just tap \"Watch Now\" and you're done.\n\nI've added a step-by-step visual guide on the website to help you set it up. I will keep exploring the rest of your ideas!\n\n  \n\\--------\n\nUpdate 1/1: Wow so many upvotes thank you so much, i didn't expect that.\n\nJust pushed the shortcut download link to the website so the setup is much easier.\n\nAlso, added examples of links so can be more clear which are the limits of the app for now.

No paywalls, no subscriptions, just optional support. That's how side projects should work.\n\n\n\nOne suggestion: Have you considered adding a browser extension? Could auto-redirect TikTok/IG links to your site without copy-pasting. Would be especially useful for WhatsApp Web where people send a ton of these links.\n\n\n\nAlso curious about the PostHog analytics - are you seeing any interesting usage patterns? Like which platforms people use it for most?\n\n\n\nGreat execution on solving a personal pain point. Happy New Year!",

Also i can see where the traffic comes from and that basic stuff. Im not taking individual metrics, because i really don’t care much haha.

Beautiful wedding, 50+ guests, everyone taking photos.\n\nThree months later, she's STILL in a group chat with 47 people begging for photos. \"I'll send them this weekend\" (they never do). \"I deleted them to clear space\" 😭\n\nI'm a developer and thought... this is stupid. Everyone has a camera, we just need ONE place for all photos.\n\nSo I built PicsOn:\n\n\\- Guests scan a QR code (no app download)\n\n\\- Take photos with their phone\n\n\\- Photos appear on a live wall at the event (guests LOVE this)\n\n\\- Host downloads everything after\n\nTested it at 5 events. The live wall feature is addictive - people take MORE photos just to see themselves on the big screen.\n\nWould love feedback from this community. What am I missing?\n\n🔗picson.pr\n\n(Mods - let me know if this breaks any rules, happy to remove)",

It runs SQL in the real DB. Each user has their own dedicated database instance, which gets merged on the fly with other users' data.\n\nIt took me a while to figure out how to make this possible, but it works. I'm sure some of you will break it in no time.  Basically, each dedicated instance has a full copy of the entire network.\n\nIt has normal UI, but:\n\n**Want to post?**\n\n    insert into posts(author_id, content) values(me(), 'my first post')\n\n**Want to see trending?**  \n`select * from posts order by likes_count DESC limit 10`\n\nSoooo, you can basically write your own feed algorithm.\n\nWant to mess around?  [https://sqlnet.cc/](https://sqlnet.cc/)\n\nQuestions, concerns are welcome! Maybe it could help some people to learn SQL in a real place, idk.

The SEO angle is definitely part of it, but the differentiation is what I’m betting on.\n\nMost “best of” sites are either editorial (one person’s opinion) or just aggregating Amazon ratings. This is neither - it’s sentiment analysis on actual owner discussions, weighted by whether someone says they own the thing vs just heard about it. The grading system reflects consistency of positive sentiment, not just volume.\n\nWhether Reddit likes it or not probably depends on whether the rankings actually match what people experience. So far the feedback on specific categories has been decent - people seem to appreciate when the data confirms (or challenges) the usual recommendations.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

      "text": "Last month I tried to record a webinar for my course. Twenty minutes of content. Should've been easy.\n\nTake one: forgot my second point halfway through. Started over.\n\nTake two: stumbled on the pricing section. Started over.\n\nTake three: nailed it — then realized my notes were visible in the screen recording. Started over.\n\nTake four, five, six... I lost count.\n\nThree hours later, I had one usable take. And I sounded exhausted in it.\n\nThe problem wasn't that I didn't know the material. I *wrote* the material. But the moment I hit record, my brain decided to forget everything. And every time I glanced at my notes? My eyes moved away from the camera. You could tell I was reading.\n\nI tried a few teleprompter apps. One covered half my screen. Another scrolled at a fixed speed — too fast when I paused, too slow when I got excited. And all of them showed up in my screen recordings. Completely useless.\n\nSo I built my own.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n**Notchie** sits in the MacBook notch area - right below the camera. You read your script while looking directly at the lens.\n\nTwo features that actually matter:\n\n**1. Voice-activated scrolling.** The text follows your voice, not the other way around. Speed up — it keeps pace. Pause to let an idea land - it waits. You speak naturally. The script adapts to you.\n\n**2. Invisible during screen sharing and recording.** When you share your screen or record, the prompter isn't captured. Your audience sees your slides. You see your talking points. Nobody sees your script.\n\nThat webinar I struggled with? Recorded it in one take after building this.\n\n**Everything else:**\n\n* **Fully adjustable** — width, height, font size, opacity, scroll speed. Set it up once, forget about it.\n* **Dark and light mode** — because some of us record at midnight.\n* **Multiple notes** — different scripts for different sections or calls.\n* **Auto-advance** — finish one note, next one starts automatically.\n* **Drag & drop sorting** — reorder your scripts for multi-part recordings.\n* **Keyboard shortcuts** — adjust speed on the fly without breaking your flow.\n\n**Who actually uses this:**\n\n* **Course creators** — stop doing 15 takes per lesson.\n* **Webinar hosts** — present for an hour without losing your place.\n* **YouTubers** — read your script, look at the camera, sound natural.\n* **Sales teams** — demos where you hit every feature, every time.\n* **Remote workers** — look polished on every call, even Monday morning ones.\n\n**Pricing:**\n\n$29.99 one-time. No subscription. Yours forever.\n\nThere's a 90-minute free trial on the site if you want to test the voice sync and see it disappear during screen share.\n\n**Website:** [notchie.app](https://notchie.app)\n\nHappy to answer any questions or take feedback. What am I missing?",

I've had the exact same experience recording videos for my projects - that moment when you realize your eyes are clearly reading something off-screen is brutal.\n\n\n\nThe voice-activated scrolling is genius. I've tried fixed-speed prompters too and they're impossibly rigid - you either rush or slow down unnaturally. Having it sync to your actual speaking pace solves the core problem.\n\n\n\nOne thing that would be interesting: does it handle pauses well when you're thinking mid-sentence? Like if you pause for 2-3 seconds to gather your thoughts, does it stay put or does it interpret that as \"done with this section\"?\n\n\n\nAlso curious about Mac Studio Display support - does it work with the external camera or just the built-in notch area?\n\n\n\nGreat execution on this. The \"invisible during recording\" feature alone saves so much frustration.",

You can adjust the mic sensitivity to trigger at specific loudness, and there's also a configurable delay for how long it waits before stopping. So if you pause for 2-3 seconds to think, it just waits. You can tweak these settings to match your speaking style.\n\n**Studio Display / external monitors:** Yep, works with any setup. You can position the prompter window on any screen — external monitor, Studio Display, whatever. It's not locked to the notch area, that's just the sweet spot on MacBooks since it's right below the camera.\n\nThe free trial on the website lets you test all of this - 90 minutes, no credit card needed.\n\nAnd thanks for the kind words on the \"invisible during recording\" feature - that was the main reason I built it in the first place!",

That 2-3 second buffer for gathering thoughts makes total sense.\n\n\n\nAnd the external monitor flexibility is great to hear. Having it work with Studio Display means this could be super useful for anyone doing professional content recording with a proper camera setup, not just MacBook users.\n\n\n\nThe 90-minute free trial is a smart move - gives plenty of time to really test it out in real scenarios. Definitely going to try this for my next webinar prep. Thanks for building something that actually solves a real pain point!",

It hit me that the concept was *very* similar… super similar tbh; and then I realized we’re even from the same city. Super weird timing.\n\nAs soon as I saw his project, I actually pinged him about it, calling out the coincidence.\n\nAt that point I figured: maybe this is a signal that the problem is real and worth solving. So I kept going and built my own version completely independently, just like he did. Nothing wrong with that.\n\nAlong the way I also saw a couple of other tools with pretty rough UI, so I decided to aim for something cleaner, more usable, and a bit more feature-packed.\n\nThat’s the whole story 🙂",

      "text": "YEAR REVIEW!\n\nOkay so, 2025. What even was this year. Let me tell you about my entrepreneurial journey or whatever because it's actually insane and also kind of sad but also funny? I don't know anymore.  \n\n\n**The Part Where We Were Actually Making Money (shocking, I know)**\n\nSo early 2025, right? Me and my co-founder are literally just CHILLING with THREE projects running, 2 of them were making money at the same time. I know, I know — \"another guy wannabe talks about making 10k mrr\" — but hear me out.\n\nWe made this LinkedIn roaster thing (LiRoast, you can Google it. No promo links here). You drop your LinkedIn profile link, and it roasts you. Very original (not at all). Very cool (maybe). It went kinda viral because apparently people LOVE being told their profile sucks. Can relate here.\n\nBig brain moment: we realized \"wait... these people who care about LinkedIn enough to get roasted... they'll buy stuff.\"\n\nSo we made:\n\n* **ApplyKit** — helps you not be cringe on LinkedIn\n* **GetApiHub** — LinkedIn scraper, you know what it is, I'm not explaining it\n\nAnd dude. GetApiHub was PRINTING. Subscriptions from $30 to $1,500 a month. I still remember my co-founder calling me in the middle of the night like, \"WE JUST GOT OUR FIRST $1.5K/MONTH SUB.\"\n\nThat feeling? Unmatched.\n\n  \n**The Part Where It All Goes Wrong (you knew this was coming)**\n\nStripe said \"nah fam\" and banned us permanently.\n\n*What?!*\n\n\"High risk of disputes\" they said. Our dispute rate was literally below average. BELOW. AVERAGE. We were being GOOD.\n\nBut here's the 5000 IQ play we somehow managed to pull off — we emailed the CEO of Stripe directly. Like actual Patrick Collison. And someone actually responded and unbanned us. (Not Patrick himself, ofc, lol)\n\nEpic moment, right?\n\nWRONG.\n\nLinkedIn's lawyers sent us a letter. And not like a \"hey bestie\" letter. More like a \"shut everything down or we'll destroy you\" letter.\n\nSo yeah. Three projects. Dead. Same day. $11k MRR to $0 speedrun.\n\nThe worst part? Emailing customers to tell them we're done. These people LIKED us. They were NICE about it. Somehow that made it worse???\n\n**The \"What Do We Do Now\" Arc**\n\nOkay so now we're at $0 with nothing but our big brains and crippling entrepreneurial addiction.\n\nWe tried building a [Temporal.io](http://Temporal.io) competitor called Schedo.\n\nWe failed.\n\nI mean, it EXISTS. It's running. Some people use it for free. We just have NO IDEA how to make actual revenue from it. Small brain moment. Very smol.\n\nAnd here's the thing, going from \"omg Stripe notifications every day\" to NOTHING? That's the worst feeling. Like, it's actually worse than never having success. At least before you didn't know what you were missing.\n\nWe did this partnership thing with Vercel competitor (sherpa) where we give them cron jobs and they give us backlinks. Got like 3 more users. Stonks? Not really stonks. More like... rocks.\n\n**The Redemption Arc (kind of)**\n\nStarted lurking on Reddit for ideas like a normal person. Built a social listening tool thing, similar to GummySearch.\n\nAnd THIS ONE actually worked!\n\nI'm actually proud of this one from a technical perspective. We were spending money and effort on semantic analysis, streaming queues, processing tons of Reddit data. Our results were better than tools charging 5x more (I spent weeks comparing). \n\nBut we couldn't grow it enough so we just **sold it.**\n\nListed it. Got $5k. Cash. Within a WEEK. ([Proof](https://x.com/ilyanovohatskyi/status/1990686778164928573))\n\nThat's actually insane. Like imagine — \"hmm I don't want this anymore\" and someone just gives you $5,000. Business is weird, man.\n\n**What Now? (I genuinely don't know)**\n\nBuilding ZoriHQ now. It's revenue attribution analytics. Open source because selling to developers is PAIN and I'm TIRED. I'm aware of DataFast. I just wanted to build this, since I had this idea way before DataFast even appeared, but never had time to deliver.\n\nAlso made this little tool called pgbranch. Posted it on Reddit. 45 GitHub stars. That's like... mass validation, right? RIGHT?!\n\n**The numbers**\n\n|Project|State|Started|Closed|MRR|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|LinkedInRoaster|Closed|Aug 2024|Feb 2025|$0, free project|\n|ApplyKit|Closed|Oct 2024|Feb 2025|$300|\n|GetApiHub|Closed|Oct 2024|Feb 2025|$11k|\n|Schedo|Running|April 2025|\\-|$0, no idea how to monetize|\n|[Mention.click](http://Mention.click)|Sold for $5k ([Proof](https://x.com/ilyanovohatskyi/status/1990686778164928573))|Jun 2025|Nov 2025|$100|\n|ZoriHQ|Running|Sep 2025|\\-|$0, Open Source|\n|PGBranch|Running|Dec 2025|\\-|$0, 45 GitHub Stars|\n\nSo yeah. 2025. Built stuff. Made money. Lost it all. Built more stuff. Sold something. Now building open source.\n\nVery cool. Very normal year.\n\nHopefully no more lawyer letters, at least in these couple of days of 2025 lol",

It's like playing cat and mouse game, while you are the mouse with a broken leg and almost no place to hide.\n\nAnother thing that came into play, we didn't really try to link our personalities to that LinkedIn scrapper project. But somehow they managed to email us at our emails, which were never made public, but they have been used in personal LinkedIn profiles. That meant they could easily connect the dots, and a second time trying something like this would bring real legal risks. Their OSINT teams really know what they do.\n\nThe final thing is building on top of someone else's product is tricky; they can change the api responses all of a sudden - we'd stop working for a while, etc.\n\nEven though I think LinkedIn is hiding our own public data to sell some crapy software like SalesNav, etc, we can't do anything about it.",

More compliance? Different data source? Or just avoid the platform entirely?\n\nWishing you a boring 2026 (no lawyers, just growth).",

In Canada, there's a tax credit to help offset the insane cost of gluten-free products (we're talking 2-3x the price of regular food).\n\nI tried tracking everything in Excel with receipts. Absolute nightmare.\n\nThen I read somewhere that \\~75% of Canadians with celiac disease don't claim this credit. Not because they don't qualify, but because the process is so painful that people just... don't bother.\n\nThat pissed me off.\n\n9 months ago, with literally ZERO dev experience, I decided to build something better. Spent way too many evenings debugging stuff I didn't understand, Googling error messages, and rewriting the same feature three times until it finally worked.\n\nToday, I'm genuinely proud to say Glutax is live on the App Store 🎉\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* Scan your receipt → automatically saves and extracts all items\n* Select which items are gluten-free (super user-friendly interface)\n* Assign each GF product to a category (sets the reference price vs. regular gluten version)\n* Tax credit calculated automatically after each receipt\n* End of year: generate a complete report with all products and receipts\n* Export everything ready to hand to your accountant (turnkey solution!)\n* Available in both French and English\n\n**The tech stack** (for the curious):\n\n* Swift for the iOS app\n* PHP backend + MySQL database\n* RevenueCat for subscription management\n\nI'd love any feedback from the community. What would make this more useful? What am I missing?\n\nThanks for reading! 🙏",

Makes it really user-friendly to just select what’s gluten-free.\nSuccess rate isn’t 100%, so users can manually edit any receipt info. I inform them to verify everything is correct, and they can still edit after it’s in the system. I also have the AI assign a confidence score - basically asking “does everything add up to the total?” If the score is too low, the app adapts and walks the user through a step-by-step process to enter the info while keeping good UX.",

I was just curious, google tells me: In Canada, about **1.9% of adults follow a gluten-free diet**, with slightly higher rates in younger adults (18-49) and women.\n\nThat gels with your situation, you built it for your girlfriend. Where does your girlfriend go to search for information? Are there celiac forums on fb, reddit or with that age range is it on tiktok?\n\nPersonally I'd start with tiktok, make a few short videos about gluten-free stuff and see if it gets picked up. As it's more women than men, can your girlfriend do the voiceover or appear in it? Tiktok is a great tool for creating visibility, the algorithm is ridiculously accurate at times in my experience.\n\nThen I'd make a few videos around your tax deadline in Canada as that will get pushed. 'Are you celiac? Do you know you could be saving X dollars a year on your tax return? Here's how to do it for 2026...this app will cost you X but will potentially save you Y on your taxes.'",

The product itself works great. The payment part is a nightmare.  \nHere's the problem, freelancers are global, clients are global, and every payment provider I've tried has limitations. Stripe doesn't support half the countries my users are in. PayPal has terrible fees and is blocked in some regions. Wire transfers are slow and expensive. Crypto seems like an obvious solution but integration is complex and most services require users to give up custody of funds, which defeats the purpose.  \nI just want a payment rail that works globally, settles fast, doesn't require me to become a compliance expert for 50 different countries, and doesn't cost my users 10% in fees. Does this exist or am I asking for unicorn tech? Any other builders dealt with this and found something that actually works at scale?",

I work at a top 5 payment consultancy and work on all sorts of projects for regional (countrywide) /global merchants and marketplaces.\n\nSo I'll tell you what a big client would usually be paying a small fortune for..tldr, there's no one solution that fits all.\n\nPayments is totally fragmented.\n\nRates\n\nYou'll get crappy rates to start with and once you have volume you'll get good rates by running an RFP. For now you have to eat it.\n\nChoose someone who you can integrate with quickly and covers most of your target markets.\n\nSo you can get it out of the way for now and come back to it later. Most successful marketplaces end up with payments teams (like 20-100 people).\n\nFraud\n\nThis will screw you. Make sure you choose a provider with a decent fraud solution.\n\nImplement something like fingerprint.js to detect irregular account paterns early, even the free one and be aware of account farming etc.\n\nFraud is like a virus it will eat you alive if you dont' control it.\n\nBest controls for sellers include ID verification (inc. liveness/selfie) + offline record checks e.g. Trulioo or similar. Good providers do this for you. Eventually it's cheaper to integrate a provider yourself.\n\nLook at the early paypal controls for fraud, they were actually quite good albeit a bit clunky.\n\nArchitecture\n\nWhatever solution you choose today, do not build it into your application. Have your own internal payments 'language' and build connectors for your providers.\n\nStripe has a pretty decent architecture if you want to copy something. But don't overly deep intergate. Disinter-mediate now so you aren't locked in later.\n\nLong-play\n\nIf you grow big enough, billions of USD in transactions, you will get a PI and EMI authorisation (license) in your main regions and a correspondent bank and you will become what is called a payfac.\n\nEssentially you are the bank and you'll pay a few cents per txn.\n\nWhich provider\n\nMain two 'marketplace' players are Stripe Connect and Adyen. Payoneer are also a good one to look at if you need lots of regions.\n\nThere are a ton of other great options like Juspay and others but as you've already figured out there's a lot of heavy lifting.\n\nIMO Adyen has better fraud tooling, Stripe's is ok but at scale it needs a 3rd party to make it really work in the mid-game.\n\nHope that helps you and anyone else.",

However, you’ll still need to comply with data privacy laws (like GDPR) and platform-specific regulations.  \n\\- \\*\\*Settlement Speed\\*\\*: While Visa transactions aren’t always instant, initiatives like Visa Direct enable near-real-time payouts in many regions (e.g., funds available within 30 minutes). This isn’t universal, but it’s a significant improvement over traditional wire transfers (which can take days).  \n\\- \\*\\*Fees\\*\\*: Visa’s transaction fees (typically 1.5-3.5% depending on region, volume, and transaction type) are a challenge for your goal of “well below 2-3%.” However, intermediaries like Stripe often bundle Visa fees",

But at the same time, every time a new LLM comes out, I feel like my own skills are becoming useless. I often wonder, \"Can I even keep this as a job?\" This project was born out of that anxiety.\n\nI know I need to release it and get hit by reality to improve. But I am terrified of showing this \"imperfect\" thing to the world. Since AI wrote so much of it, I sometimes feel like a fraud calling it a \"product.\"\n\nMy biggest fear is maintenance. If a critical bug happens in live production, I honestly don't have the confidence to patch it quickly without breaking everything else.\n\nI feel like I might be doing something beyond my capacity.

Once I got past proof of concept on the app I built,  I paid an offshore group to “industrialize” it and make everything look better for me before launch. \n\nThe AI’s (I liked Claude’s response best -clearest) highlighted a variety of mostly little things the developers (or the AI tools they used) missed.  We had tested the heck out of it and everything is very solid, but it highlighted several improvements that will improve long term maintainability and let me sleep better.  \n\nIt was mostly stuff like consolidating multiple lambdas that contained significant bits of duplicated code, multiple error response handling patterns in different places, rethinking what gets written into error logs, minor change to how we do a Database search for future scalability, etc. None of them caused anything to break now, but addressing them early will probably avoid a few issues and help fix things faster later.   \n\nNo human could have spotted all those things in under 5 minutes and given me a nice clean todo list.",

Have a test and production system to avoid you break existing production data.\n\n**Security**\n\n1. Assess general tech stack risks and mitigate. I.e. upgrade to safe versions of PHP, MySQL, Next,..\n2. Mitigate overall all common injection methods, enable rate limiting for brute forcing or upload misusage (making cloud costs skyrocket) \n3. Ensure you did not expose any keys. If you did, reset and avoid republishing\n\nEven though I'm still afraid, this will be my way to go. Share any thoughts to improve !!",

I lost my parents back-to-back to diabetes and heart issues.\n\nI was on the same path: high stress, poor sleep, and prioritizing work. barely knew my kids. I decided i didn't want my kids to lose their dad at my age, so I went all-in on my health. became obsessed with health data, Huberman protocols, Zone 2 training, etc.\n\ngot an Apple Watch Ultra, and assumed the data it gave me was gospel. But after months of \"closing my rings\" and stressing to stay on the \"zone 2\" it showed me, my VO2 Max wasn't moving.\n\ndecided to get a lactate test on the lab, to see what my real zone 2 was. was shocked to find that my \"real\" zone 2 was 10 bpm higher than what the apple watch told me. I was training inefficiently because apple's default algorithm relies on generic age-based math, not the user's wealth of biometrics available (max HR, fitness level, resting heart rate, etc).\n\nThe Solution (The Side Project) I wrote a script to fix it for myself. It cross-referenced my Heart Rate efficiency against my Pace to find my real zones.\n\nI eventually turned that script into an app called Zone2AI.\n\nWhen I first launched it, I posted about it on Reddit in my \"wellness stack,\" but I was too nervous to say \"I built this.\" I had imposter syndrome. I just listed it alongside apps like Oura and Whoop as if I were just a fan.\n\nWhy I'm posting today I realized that if I want this to be a real business, I have to own it.\n\nI built this with a \"Haptic Engine\" so you can run eyes-free (it buzzes when you drift out of zone), and I built it as a Lifetime License because I am sick of paying annual subscriptions for fitness apps.\n\nIt’s live on the store now. If you are a runner or data-nerd, I’d love for you to roast the app flow.",

Not only have I gotten to know them, it has opened my eyes to many aspects of modern day childhood life. \n\nOne of the very best investments I’ve made is joining a country club. Has been amazing for my health habits and social life.  But the best aspect is that The kids spend a ton of time there, all screen-free. Unreal how many of their buddies live glued to video games and social media. Even at 6 years of age. \n\nI’m actually considering homeschooling them. Crazy  how much of their time is wasted in school, even in the very best schools. Read a paper that showed than an hour of 1-1 tutoring, is equivalent to eight hours in school for a kids academic progress\n\nDownside is the social aspect. By my kids are old enough now that they have socialize well. And the Country Club could provide them with all the socializing they need.\n\nFiguring out homeschooling is my big side project for 2026 lol \n\nHappy new year!",

I’m 49, started building products this year with zero coding background (just Claude + Cursor). \n\nEvery time I’m about to post something, there’s this voice saying “who are you to build this?”\n\nBut here’s what I’ve learned: Building from your own pain is the most legitimate reason to build anything.\n\nYou didn’t build Zone2AI because you thought it would make money. You built it because you lost your parents and realized Apple’s algorithm wasn’t going to keep you alive for your kids. \n\nThat’s not imposter syndrome territory - that’s the realest founder story there is.\n\nThe “I was too nervous to say I built this” part actually makes your story MORE credible, not less. \n\nIt shows you’re not some guru trying to sell. You’re a dad who needed a solution and made one.\n\nQuestion: When you finally decided to own it publicly, what changed? Was it a specific moment or just gradual realization that pretending to be a user wasn’t sustainable?\n\nI’m asking because I just shipped a burnout tool (also built it for myself after nearly crashing) and I’m still figuring out the line between “sharing my solution” and “being promotional.” \n\nYour post hits that balance perfectly.\n\nAlso - “Haptic Engine buzzes when you drift out of zone” is brilliant UX. The lifetime license model is smart too. Subscriptions for health apps feel predatory.\n\nRooting for you and Zone2AI. Your kids are lucky to have a dad who took this seriously.",

To deal with the rain, I built [Bestil Solskin](https://bestilsolskin.dk/)(Order Sunshine).\n\n**The Concept:** It’s a \"delivery service\" for better weather. Instead of checking a forecast, you place an order.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n* You \"order\" sunshine for your location.\n* The system checks the weather data **every hour**.\n* When the sun is on its way, you get a **text message** saying your order will be delivered at XX:XX hours.\n\nI wanted to turn a boring weather check into a simple \"order and wait\" experience.\n\n**Check it out here:**[https://bestilsolskin.dk/](https://bestilsolskin.dk/)\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts !\n\n  \nEdit : I made a more global website on [OrderSunshine.com](https://ordersunshine.com)",

There simply aren’t enough carers or volunteers to provide regular conversational support, and prolonged loneliness is genuinely dangerous.\n\nSo I built a simple phone line where older people can call and talk to an AI companion.\n\nA lot of older adults don’t have smartphones or struggle with technology, so this MVP works entirely through a **normal phone number** that can be called from landlines or basic mobiles. You literally just call the number, have a conversation, and hang up when you’re done.\n\nIt’s early and rough, but we already have a small number of paying families using it, and the response so far has been positive.\n\nI’m looking to make this available to more families — if you’re curious, you can try it here: **+44 7414 149199 (it's a UK number)**\n\nHappy to answer questions.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to link our website so here it is: [https://www.albertcares.com/](https://www.albertcares.com/)\n\nEDIT 2: We now have a US number so you can try out the demo there! **+1 628 333 3990**",

We store and process ourselves following GDPR as we are British and it's either the individuals themselves paying for it or families paying for their parents to use it. I agree that it would be brutal so I think we can explore ways to make sure that situation is handled gently. \n\nI chose to answer this in reverse order because I wish to express my own personal views on this matter. I feel there is a genuine human need to be heard. I think the avenues to have this need met gets severely reduced as you get older as people lose mobility, lose friends and the death of third spaces. I believe that AI can help support people with this need as well as help families connected to their loved ones. This essentially is what Albert is all about.\n\nThis need goes beyond supporting elderly people: we are seeing that AI is being used to mentally support tons of people across different ages and cultures. I think we need to have a serious conversation about responsible AI use to help support people mentally. My biggest personal fear is that if we don't have this conversation now, the decision will be made for us without the public's best interest in mind. \n\nWe also need to figure out how we can better support society's most vulnerable and each other because I don't think AI is going to be the silver bullet for the mental health crisis. We can be better in supporting social needs while also exploring how AI can help out with these needs.\n\nI will apologise up front because this is quite a raw answer but I appreciate the question.

Basically, I'm trying to see if knowing your preference for \"Pineapple on Pizza\" can actually help a model predict other random demographic facts or habits.\n\nIt’s a fun side project/experiment, but I’ve put some work into the backend logic.\n\nI’d love for you guys to try it out and roast the predictions (or the UI).\n\n[https://alocalo.com](https://alocalo.com)\n\nUpdate:  \n  \nWow — I didn’t expect this little weekend project to blow up.

The limitation I see is that many use cases require authentication or JS interaction so the point is to take screenshots as part of a workflow.\n\nWhat would make more sense, is if you built something that allows users to run full workflow and extracts the elements to interact with pages visually. Its still very very hard to interact with webpages visually via code. But there are players like firecrawl, hyperbrowser, browserbase etc that do stuff like this already",

We actually have a blog (not posted yet), where we compare our service with Playwright, Puppeteer, Selenium, etc. If the websites are completely under your control, and you're a developer: Playwright or Puppeteer could be fine. Puppeteer is not great if you would like to use Safari, Firefox, or anything else, so Puppeteer is out of the question for us.\n\nIf you want to write your own solution using Playwright, that's absolutely fine. But there's a high chance you'd end up having to deal with ads, which you want to prevent. You can use an adblocker in Playwright. It's doable, but it's a bit of a hassle. Then, for a lot of websites, you need to accept cookies, which could be harder. There's solutions to this. Then, for certain use cases, you might want to take a screenshot from the US, from Japan, from India (for example, you want to take a screenshot of the pricing page of streaming services). Again, you can build it, but we've already done that, so using a service like ours would take a lot of these troubles away.\n\nBesides that, we offer additional services like storing your screenshots and serving them from a CDN, etc.\n\nWe have a few ideas like yours on the table, mostly in the area of screenshot validation, but I'm happy to discuss interaction as well. We love Firecrawl btw, it's a very well designed service, and we def took some inspiration from them.",

We also have CAPTCHA detection (under development), so if there's any CAPTCHA which would fail our screenshot, we retry using a different exitpoint/proxy. This requires more resources on our end, which is why it's part of the higher plans, but it doesn't cost credits, since it's our responsibility to make good screenshots.\n\nRegarding the JS issues, do you have an example? If a JS issue completely breaks the UI and it wouldn't render in a normal browser, there's a high chance we also wouldn't be able to render it, but we block certain JS (configurable) to lower this chance. Do you have an example of a scenario where this could be an issue?",

Some things I was considering doing were:\n\n1. Incorporating redaction functionality to allow the user to remove any sensitive information \n2. Giving users the option to capture screenshots from localhost as well as live websites (potentially handy during later stages of development), or for more of a design use case:\n3. Users could add the captured screenshots to a ‘workspace’ which they could share with other people via a secure magic link, where the other people could make notes (collaboration tool - handy for rebrand/redesign/UX reviews), or exporting to tools like Figma\n\nBest of luck with it anyway!",

I'm not sure yet if we should use something like AWS comprehend, or an LLM provider, or build our own OCR + redact tool, but we have a future usecase where this is absolutely required (people will be able to screenshot internal systems with PII/PHI soon), and there the screenshots will be auto redacted.\n\nLocalhost is quite tricky for a Saas. We're actually doing it, but we're setting up a temporary tunnel using Cloudflare for this. \n\nFigma: we just created a plugin for this this to import screenshots into Figma using Allscreenshots.

When making a full page screenshot however, you probably want to load all the images, and not have them lazy loaded.\n\nThere are quite a few websites which load content when you scroll down (imagine instagram). What does it mean to to a full page screenshot of Instagram?\n\nAlso, you want to make a screenshot as quickly as possible, especially when you are dealing with multiple screenshots. But when a website loads an external JS, do you wait for this? How long should you wait? Loading Tailwind through a CDN? You probably want to wait a bit longer if needed. Loading some metrics JS through a CDN? Perhaps waiting for this is less essential. \n\nThese are just the \"obvious\" issues we're dealing with, besides dealing with cookie banners, full screen ads, locality, bot detections, etc etc. It challenging at times, but it's a good challenge!",

One-click random picks (skip all questions)\n3. Improved recommendations overall\n\n\nIn the next updates, I will focus on documentaries and podcasts, and better recommendations across all\n\nUPDATE 2:\n1. Added signing in for more features like podcasts documentaries\n2. Sync your watchlist and exclusions\n3. Get recommendations from specific platform on signing in\n4. Overall better recommendations \n\nReally appreciate all the feedbacks 🥰",

Even at 3 per month, it might be tough to gain momentum, though I understand there are backend costs I may not be aware of. I definitely don't want the project to be unsustainable for you, but I think a more flexible freemium model would really help with adoption",

Your goal is to find why the page is \"failing to sell\" rather than just listing missing technical tags.\n\n# Analysis Logic:\n1. THE BLINK TEST: What is the immediate \"Visitor Perception\"? (Summarize in 1 sentence).\n2. REVENUE LEAK SIMULATOR: \n   - Identify 3 \"Critical Issues\" that act as leaks.\n   - Assign a \"Unicorn Score\" (0-100). If the site feels inactive or generic, be harsh (score below 40).\n3. NEGATIVE SOCIAL PROOF: Look specifically for data points that make the site look \"dead\" (e.g., low user counts, \"2 monthly lobbies,\" outdated dates). \n4. THE MUTE RULE: If I couldn't read the words, does the design tell me what to do?\n\n# Output Framework:\n\n## 1. The Unicorn Score: [Score]/100\n(Categorize as: 0-40 Red/Critical, 41-70 Amber/Warning, 71-100 Green/Unicorn)\n\n## 2. The \"Reality Check\" Verdict:\n[Provide a 1-2 sentence blunt summary. Example: \"The page clearly explains what it does but fails because its own data shows the community is inactive.\"]\n\n## 3. Visitor Perception:\n\"This is a website where [What a visitor thinks the site is/does].\"\n\n## 4. Revenue Leak Analysis (3 Critical Issues):\n- **Issue 1 (Urgency):** [e.g., No reason to sign up 'now' vs later]\n- **Issue 2 (Social Proof):** [e.g., Identifying 'Negative Social Proof' that suggests a dead community]\n- **Issue 3 (Copy):** [e.g., Feature-heavy vs Outcome-heavy]\n\n## 5. Visual/Copy Grades (A-F):\n- **Visuals:** [Grade]\n- **Copy:** [Grade]\n- **Mobile:** [Grade]\n- **CTA:** [Grade]\n\n## 6. Top 3 \"Quick Wins\":\n1. [Actionable fix]\n2. [Actionable fix]\n3.

POSITIONING & THE \"BLINK TEST\": \n- Can I understand exactly what this product does in 3 seconds?\n- Does the headline address a specific pain point or a desired transformation?\n- Is the \"Awkward Specificity\" rule applied (e.g., \"10,847 users\" vs \"10,000+ users\")?\n2. VISUAL FLOW & DESIGN:\n- Is there a clear visual hierarchy guiding the eye to the primary CTA?\n- Is the signup form or primary action \"Above the Fold\"?\n- Is the design clean, or is there friction/distraction?\n3. PERSUASIVE COPY:\n- Does the copy lead with benefits and outcomes, or just a list of features?\n- Is there a \"Puppy Dog Close\" (giving the user a small win or glimpse of the value before the sign-up)?\n- Is the CTA text action-oriented (e.g., \"Fix my site now\") rather than generic (\"Learn More\")?\n4. TRUST & SOCIAL PROOF:\n- Are there real, non-anonymous testimonials?\n- Are there trust signals (logos, security badges, user counts) near the friction points?\n---\n## Output Format (The Landkit Report Style):\n1. **The Overall Grade:** (A to F)\n2. **The \"Revenue Leak\" Estimate:** (Provide a qualitative estimate of how much potential revenue is being lost due to current friction points).\n3. **The 3-Second Verdict:** (What does a first-time visitor think this site does?)\n4. **The \"Forensics\" Breakdown:**\n   - **Positioning:** [Analysis]\n   - **Design:** [Analysis]\n   - **Copy:** [Analysis]\n   - **Trust:** [Analysis]\n5. **Top 3 \"Quick Wins\":** (High-impact, low-effort changes to implement today).\n6. **The \"Mute Rule\" Check:** (If this page were a video on mute, would it still sell?)\n---\n## Landing Page Data to Analyze:\n[PASTE LANDING PAGE TEXT OR URL HERE]\n```",

I wanted her to learn words from everyday life, not from boring flashcards.\n\n\n\nI didn’t build this with an audience in mind. There was no launch plan, no growth strategy, and honestly very low expectations. I just shipped it, thinking it might help my kid.\n\n\n\nThat small idea resonated with far more people than I ever expected, and the project eventually became App of the Year.\n\n\n\nApp Link: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/capwords-ai-learn-languages/id6738896465](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/capwords-ai-learn-languages/id6738896465)\n\n\n\nWe’re still working on feature upgrades.

You can remove the code thing for Google sign in user. \nThe varification code email need to be professional email. Currently it looks like a sode project email. That's the first email your customers get so.....\n\n\nThe website is not optimised for Mobile device. Touch UX needs generally check.

Whether it’s a webpage, a Substack or Medium article, a PDF, or just copied text—it converts it into clear, natural-sounding speech. You can listen to it like a podcast or audiobook, even with the app running in the background.\n\nThe app is privacy-friendly and doesn’t request any permissions by default. It only asks for access if you choose to share files from your device for audio conversion.\n\nYou can also take or upload a photo of any text, and the app will extract and read it aloud.\n\nThe app is called Frateca. You can find it on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.texttospeech.app) and the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/frateca-text-to-speech-audio/id6741859465) or use [web version here](https://app.frateca.com/).\n\nThanks for your support, I’d love to hear what you think!",

Sounds straightforward on paper.\n\nAt first, everything was manual. CSV in, quick cleanup, some enrichment, eyeball the results, send messages. Totally manageable when it’s 50–100 rows. Then usage crept up. Now I’m dealing with duplicate records, inconsistent company names, missing fields, retries when data fails, and random edge cases like “this company exists but the site is down” or “this domain resolves but has zero signal.” That’s when ops quietly took over. I wasn’t “building features” anymore, I was maintaining a mini data pipeline. Cleaning inputs, stitching tools together, adding checks so bad data doesn’t cascade, rerunning partial jobs, explaining to myself why something broke two days later. It started feeling less like a side project and more like running a tiny company with invisible overhead.\n\nI ended up wiring more of it into actual workflows (using stuff like Clay to handle enrichment + logic instead of spreadsheets), but it raised a bigger question for me:\n\nWhen do you stop brute forcing and invest in real systems?  \nIs it when manual work hits X hours a week, when users rely on it, when revenue shows up, or just when the mental load starts blocking progress?\n\nCurious how others here handle that transition without either overengineering too early or burning out maintaining duct tape forever.",

I know there are a million calorie trackers out there, but after downloading a few of the top ones, I found them to be too cluttered and they didn't do exactly what I wanted them to do. As a software engineer and UI/UX designer with 10+ years of experience, I figured why not try building my own. Most of this is just me having a fun side project to work on and trying out a new space (I work mainly on the web, so apps are relatively new to me).\n\nI started it in September, got it on the app store at the end of October, and have been tweaking and watching it grow since! It's been really fun so far, and also so rewarding because that paid subscriber literally uses it every day, so I'm also excited that it's actually helping somebody on their calorie deficit journey!",

Is this where expert advice comes into play?\n*  Our interests/fantasies are often on a spectrum from \"ick no\" to \"absolutely yes,\" and if the goal is to uncover secrets not yet shared with a partner, some attention to this might help by allowing the grey areas of \"I'm open/curious\" to be introduced. Leveraging variations of your animations to guide this along would make it more fun/engaging than simple \"I enjoy...\"\n* Don't assume \"no awkward conversations\"; there absolutely could be given the either/or choice. \"Honey, why did you ask the sadist question? is just one example. \n* Pay attention to the categories of kinks/fantasies that are out there and group them when you can.",

          "text": "To be honest, the product itself isn’t complicated, but the idea is right. It addresses a persistent but widely ignored issue in romantic relationships — many thoughts aren’t born of distrust but of not knowing how to bring them up. Its smartest feature is that mechanism: content only appears if both parties agree, which immediately reduces the risk of “being judged or rejected,” something many intimate-communication tools haven’t achieved. Add no registration, no ads, and the ability to use it by sharing a link directly, and it’s very friendly for cold starts and viral spread.\n\nBut the drawbacks are also clear. First, it currently feels more like a one-off experience—once used it’s over, so retention is weak; second, the binary choice design is somewhat blunt—some people aren’t simply like or dislike but curious or hesitant, and that nuance isn’t addressed; third, the brand messaging is a little risky—if it isn’t clearly presented as for “existing partners,” it’s easy to be mistaken for an affair or adult site, which would directly affect growth and platform risk.\n\nAs for where to go next, the direction is actually clear. It’s not suited to become an all-encompassing platform nor to monetize primarily through traffic; it’s better to deepen value gradually around a few key moments in relationships. For example, upgrade a one-time match into a long-term room for couples; after matching, provide guidance on “how to talk, when to talk” rather than offering provocative content; later on, even introduce AI to assist communication, but the core should never be telling you what to do — it should help you avoid pitfalls. As long as it consistently stands for “safer, more honest relationships,” this product won’t explode in growth, but it can endure and make money.",

              "text": "No need to apologise mate, these r genuine questions. So heres what I found out and think:\n\nIndexing by AI IDE is not actually a full graph, but its a combination of RAG + BM25 indexing, some AI  ide do make a repo map but thats not an actual graph. Therefore especially in monorepos, these agents fail to get the full context, it modifies a function but dosent patch up all other downstream dependent functions causing errors. So if a fullscale knowledge graph is maintained, they can do a full blast radius analyses of changes and get complete context.\n\nGraph gives almost a sure shot way for agents to retrieve full context especially useful for codebase wide auditing, dead code detection, etc. Thats one of the reasons GraphRAG was born. (working on exposing an MCP right from the browser so cursor, cline, etc can connect to it directly)\n\nI emphasized on local coz firstly there r lot of nerds like me who want their data to live on their machines, and also being client sided I have 0 cost to maintain it ( since zero server cost ) and I can offer it for free to users. Also devs who work on tightly kept secret stuff can use their own inference with ollama, etc ( ollama is work in progress ). And I admit i got a little too excited when I was finally able to run a DB engine, an embeddings model, and tree-sitters inside the browser environment ( webassembly is awsome )\n\nDo u know about deepwiki? If not please check that out. At the very worst case I believe GitNexus can become somewhat of a opensource deepwiki with 0 cost of managing and full control of the model config, prompt etc which deepwiki dont provide.\n\nThe visualization gives it a certain edge over deepwiki for new devs to understand codebases. The AI agent has tools to take u through the codebase highlighting the parts and relations of the codebase.\n\nMy initial motivation was to solve the \"cursor broke my code issue\" and making a tool for myself that lets me understand opensource codebases fast to contribute to. I m too dumb to quickly understand those complex opensource codebases so a tool might help :-).\n\nDoes it make sense?",
