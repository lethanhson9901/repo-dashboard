This quickly escalated into a much larger project than expected, from a time, effort, and cost perspective :). I also managed to archive a lot of the House Oversight committee's documents, including from the epstein estate.\n\nI scraped everything, ran it through OpenAI's batch API, and built a full-text search with network graphs leveraging PostgreSQL full text search.\n\nNow at 1,317,893 documents indexed with 238,163 people identified (lots of dupes, working on deduping these now). I'm also currently importing non PDF data (like videos etc). \n\nFeedback is welcome, this is my first large dataset project with AI.  I've written tons of automation scripts in python, and built out the website for searching, added some caching to speed things up.\n\n[**https://epsteingraph.com**](https://epsteingraph.com)",

For people names specifically, combining trigram similarity with Levenshtein distance works surprisingly well — something like \\`SELECT \\* FROM people WHERE similarity(name, 'target') > 0.6\\` catches most common variations (middle names, initials, typos in OCR output). Way cheaper than running another round of LLM calls for entity resolution.\n\nAlso curious about your scraping setup — 1.3M docs is a lot of I/O. Did you parallelize the downloads or run them sequentially? And what was the split between OCR-able scanned PDFs vs docs that already had a text layer? That ratio can massively affect both accuracy and cost.\n\nImpressive project for a first large dataset + AI build ngl.",

The fact that this is actually native macOS gives it a huge advantage there.\n\n  \nCurious about one thing though, do you have any plans for a quick capture flow? Like a keyboard shortcut to drop a new card from anywhere without switching to the app first? That is the one thing that keeps me opening Apple Notes for quick thoughts even when I prefer a different tool for organizing them.",

Just bought it!\n\nAny feature updates planned? I am happy with it as it is, but if possible to get updates - I immediately noticed a few things:\n\n\\- I understand that the design concept for it is to be monochrome, but at least a few optional colors for cards would help to group tasks\n\n\\- a shortcut to delete the current card would be really useful (CMD+Backspace, maybe?)\n\n\\- a shortcut to \"finish writing\" in the current card and release the focus (or you can call it \"Submit\") (CMD + Enter?)\n\n\\- a shortcut to list all shortcuts (Shift + ?)\n\n\\- some sort of scrolling the canvas would be useful. When I use it full screen, and then resize - I can't scroll to cards that get cut off / hidden. Basically, forcing me to use it the same size all the time.\n\nНу красунчик просто!

It’s definitely giving me organized “so fresh and so clean” vibes!\n\n🥹🥂🗝️👑\n\n** I don’t believe that people should be lied to.. if their work is trash, let them know where they can hopefully improve (IF YOU’RE IN A POSITION TO EVEN SAY! IF YOU DONT KNOW, WELL….🤐🤫) Has anyone ever hear the old saying? \n“If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all.”\n           My point is instead of going out of your way to see the bad in all posts similar to this one. Look at the positives in the persons hard work. Be kind and honest to people.

      "text": "Everyone says it's never too late to start. But when you're actually doing it in your mid-40s, that voice in your head says otherwise.\n\nI'm in my mid-40s, starting this ambitious project with great expectations but even greater fear of failure.\n\nAround 40 days ago I committed to building and launching 6 products in 12 months. The first one goes live in about 2 weeks.\n\nEverywhere I look, it's 20-something founders shipping their second or third company. Moving fast, pivoting overnight, building audiences of 50K like it's nothing.\n\nAnd here I am, just getting started.\n\nBut I've been around the block. Built other businesses, made money, lost money, learned a few things about what people actually want vs what I think they want. That instinct matters more than I realized.\n\nThe young founders have energy and speed on their side. No question.\n\nI have something else. I can smell when an idea is already validated vs when I'm building in the dark. I know that trying to compete head-to-head in a crowded space is suicide - you need to carve out your corner first.\n\nThese aren't things you learn from a course. You learn them by screwing up enough times.\n\nStill, some days I wonder if I should've done this 20 years ago. Other days I think starting now is exactly right.\n\nI'm documenting the whole thing on X, Threads and here on Reddit as I go. Not because I have it figured out, but because maybe there are others out there doing the same thing and we can learn from each other.\n\nIf you're in your 40s (or beyond) building something, I'd genuinely love to hear how it's going for you. What does it feel like on your end?\n\n42 days in. First launch soon. Let's see what happens. ",

Most successful startups are founded by middle-aged entrepreneurs. \n\nDespite the popular belief that youth drives innovation, data shows **age is a significant advantage** in entrepreneurship, particularly for building high-impact, scalable ventures. ",

          "text": "44 here, just shipped my first product 11 days ago after 20 years in B2B sales. Zero sales so far but the learning curve is wild. You're absolutely right about the instinct thing. I can smell bullshit product ideas a mile away now - stuff I would've wasted 6 months on in my 20s, I skip in 5 minutes because I've watched enough companies burn money on \"solutions\" nobody asked for. The age thing is weird though. On one hand, I have the patience and discipline to actually finish something (younger me would've quit after Day 3). On the other hand, watching 23-year-olds with 50K followers making $10K/month while I'm at Day 11 with 0 sales is... humbling haha ;) But here's what I notice: the young founders pivot fast because they can afford to fail 10 times. We can't. So we ship slower but more deliberately. That's not a weakness, it's just a different game. Also - you're doing 6 products in 12 months? That's ambitious as hell. Are you validating each one before building or just shipping fast and seeing what sticks? 42 days in is nothing. You're just getting started. Let us know when Product #1 launches! Congrats on taking this leap btw! 💪👏",

First of all, you 0 sales is more than normal thing, it is the \"Slowly, then suddenly\" type of thing, once you fine tune your GTM strategy and reach the right audience, then the \"suddenly part\" kicks in.\n\nYou are right, 6 products in 12 months it is absolutely scary, but the idea is exactly the one you've mentioned \"shipping fast and seeing what sticks\", we can definitely not market 6 products at the same time alone (my co-founder and me), so, we will simply dismissed what doesn't work and move forward. At the same time, some of those products are \"boring products\" (not novel ideas, things that already work, are already proven, and have already audience paying for these type of products), so, we are mixing \"novel ideas\" perhaps nobody wants (big risk) that we would need to validate before hand, with proven ideas we know that are already validated.\n\nWhat is your product about by the way?

The mental blocks you face are just your brain's safety mechanisms trying to protect you. But with some self-compassion, you can learn to work with them rather than against them.\n\nIf the voice in your head is telling you this is all too late, try asking it: \"What part of this feels unsafe?\" Your brain is just trying to keep you from potential pain or embarrassment. But you've been around the block. You know how to fail and learn. So what's the worst that could happen?\n\nThis is uncharted territory, but that doesn't mean it's not the right path for you.

I too started late in the game as well, at 45 making my first app. I would caution on trying to launch 6 products in 12 months and instead focus on getting the first one out.   \n\n\nIf you are able to smell out a good idea, then the other big advice I wish someone had shared with me sooner is this, make sure you market and build your brand and network. You will need that for future iterations. Bringing multiple apps in a year just complicate that as your message and vision will be misunderstood by the average person that, if they even do see your idea which is challenging without ads, marketing, SEO, word of mouth, etc, will still wonder if App X from you is different from App Y and how did you make that many and support them. If you focus on one App then they will think of you and then in the future if it had their needs met, will have slightly more trust that you made something for them in the first place. It also allows you to message them in the future with the next launch and get more buzz going.\n\nGood Luck!",

I'm in my early 30s but started my AI journey later than most in the space, and I constantly battle that feeling of 'everyone else is 10 steps ahead.'\n\nBut here's what I've learned: your timing actually gives you an unfair advantage. Those 20-something founders are moving fast, sure, but they're also making a lot of rookie mistakes at scale. You already know how to validate ideas, manage resources, and read market signals. That's not something you can learn from a course or a Twitter thread.\n\nThe biggest mistake I see is people trying to compete on energy and speed when experience and judgment are actually more valuable. You're building 6 products in 12 months - that's ambitious, but I'd encourage you to think about quality of validation over quantity of launches. One product with real traction beats six experiments that never find product-market fit.\n\nAlso, documenting in public is smart. The meta-narrative of 'founder in their 40s building' is itself differentiated positioning. People want to follow journeys, not just products.\n\nLooking forward to seeing what you ship. The fact that you're questioning yourself is probably a good sign - it means you're thinking critically rather than just building in a bubble.",

Limited context window.   \nIf you have a large meeting, like 1h or something, the transcript is relatively big and can't fit in the single request. You are limited to 4k of tokens roughly. Which is not enough. I could split this into chunks with overlapping parts, but still, the summary of the meeting would be far from ideal.  \nRegarding speech recognition.  I tried various models, even bundled Whisper into the app initially.  \nWith Whisper, you need a large model to do proper STT, and it's slow.  \nApple's native STT API is exptremelly good imo. It's fast and predictable.\n\nOne limitation I discovered is that you can't transcribe two separate audio streams at the same time. You def need to mix audio buffers into a single stream. And it also has a 1m length limit for the buffer.",

This is the very first version that uses a motor to keep the slinky moving forever. It was a lot of trial and error to get the timing right!\n\nThe next version will include a small computer (Arduino or ESP32) with sensors to adjust the speed automatically.\n\nMy dream is to create a real product from this. I’m documenting the whole build process and my progress on YouTube.\n\nFollow the journey here: [https://www.youtube.com/@Mr.Slinky3D](https://www.youtube.com/@Mr.Slinky3D)\n\nI would love to hear your feedback or ideas!",

People will literally give you a 1 star review just to protest the pricing model even if they never tried the app. Switched to a one-time purchase and the tone of feedback completely changed overnight.\n\n  \nYour point about privacy-first being a tradeoff is the most underrated insight here. I went the same route (no analytics, no accounts) and it does feel like flying blind. What helped me was adding an optional in-app feedback button that sends a plain text email. No tracking, no accounts, but you get qualitative signal from the people who care enough to write. Even 5 of those a week gives you more useful direction than aggregate analytics dashboards.\n\n  \nOn the B2C marketing side, the community approach is the way. I found that commenting genuinely in niche subs where my users actually hang out (not spamming launch posts) drove more installs than any ad spend. The trick is that it takes months to compound and most people quit after week 2.\n\n  \n$1.5k in 3 months on a nights-and-weekends project is legit. The people who call that small usually have never shipped anything themselves.",

And it was always expensive as hell.\nAbout half a year ago I quit my job. While job hunting, started building an Al tool with a few friends. The idea was pretty straightforward. Let ecommerce operators generate their own product images and videos instead of paying insane creative costs. We named it [Pixelripple](https://www .pixelripple.ai/) and the goal was simple. Let visuals do the selling.\n\nFast forward to now. The site is fully live. We are doing over 4k USD in MRR and it is still growing. But at the same time, a buyer came in with a pretty decent offer and wanted to acquire the whole thing. Now my partners and I are stuck debating whether to keep running it ourselves or just sell and move on.\n\nIf we keep operating it, we will need to put in more operating capital and honestly there is a lot of uncertainty. I am kinda worried the pressure will get heavy real quick. On the other hand, we also keep thinking maybe the product is actually worth way more than the offer. But we are not even sure about that either.\n\nThis is my first startup ever, so I am genuinely asking. Should I cash out and go find a full time job, or keep pushing and see where this goes?",

At $4k MRR you're still in the early growth phase - if it's trending up, the valuation in 6-12 months could be significantly higher. Buyers know this too, which is why they're offering now.\n\nA few things to consider:\n\n1. What's the multiple? SaaS businesses typically sell at 3-5x ARR (sometimes higher with good growth). At $4k MRR ($48k ARR), anything under $150k would be selling yourself short if the trajectory is solid.\n\n2. Can you keep your day job while running it? If the tool is mostly self-serve, you might not need to go all-in. Keep the revenue flowing while reducing personal risk.\n\n3. Talk to other founders. Seriously - communities like r/selflaunch or even just posting updates here can help you think through these decisions with people who've been in your exact shoes.\n\nThe fact that someone wants to buy it is validation.

THE LAUNCH TRIFECTA) :**\n\n1. **Timing** \\- when you launch/post matters more than what you post. Kinda.\n   * Wrong: Do exactly what everybody else is doing. Launch another website builder :D\n   * Right: Think what is at the overlap between what you like to get absurdly deep into, now can be done diffrenetly than a few years ago, people actively talk that they need it. Yup, it's hard, nobody said it wouldn't be.\n2. **Hook** \\- you have 2 seconds to stop the scroll\n   * Wrong: \"Check out my new app!\"\n   * Right: Value. Come on, help others, nobody will help you if you don't help others. Sorry folks, I'm one of the guys that think mentioning your product name is 100% ok, but just try to deliver value. Make it free for one day for you audience, make the post funny, tell something truly useful worth remembering and unique. Again, nobody said that founding projects is easy.\n3. **Landing** \\- where you send traffic\n   * Wrong: \"We revolutionize the world one step at a time\"\n   * Right: Combat your need for aesthetics (here's where I sometimes fall myself) or perfection. Just make the value is as clear as possible. Better to make it clear but small than grand but not clear. I've had websites that had spelling mistakes do well because there was a clear USP and clear job that the product does. The other way around (pretty website, \"world anew\" claim) rarely works.\n\n\\---------\n\n\n\nDrop your project below with:\n\n* Link\n* One-line description\n* Where you're planning to launch \n\n  \nI'll do quick teardowns for first 10 or so (an eventful day for me today, so be patient, I should be able to reply to everybody within usually like 1-2hrs tops). No selling, just genuinely want to help. Seeing too many great projects get buried. If you are super good, I won't be able to help, but if there's a mistake that you are missing, I may be able to spot it in 5s, so just drop a link and let's have some fun!",

Right now you have to sit at your laptop waiting. With Moshi you get a push notification when it needs you, approve from your phone, and go back to whatever you were doing.\n\n  \nKey differentiator vs other terminal apps: Uses the Mosh protocol instead of plain SSH so your session survives wifi drops, phone sleep, subway tunnels etc. Also has on-device voice-to-terminal (Whisper runs locally, no cloud) which sounds gimmicky but is actually useful when youre on the couch and your agent needs a quick yes/no.\n\n  \nBiggest concern: Niche is maybe too narrow? AI coding agents are growing fast but the intersection of \"uses coding agents\" and \"wants mobile access\" might be small right now. Curious what you think.",

The one you personally use the most. Ignore the other two completely for now. Then give yourself one single evening to just slap in the simplest possible paywall. It does not have to be perfect. RevenueCat or even just a basic StoreKit setup with one tier. Ship it with the ugliest paywall you can live with. You can always polish it later but you cannot iterate on something that is not in the store.\n\n  \nThe \"no budget for ads\" thing is actually fine. Most indie apps get their first 50-100 users from a single Reddit or HN launch post and word of mouth from friends already on TestFlight. You already have friends using it daily so you are ahead of most people at this stage.\n\n  \nAlso congrats on the new kid. Sleep deprivation makes everything feel 10x harder than it actually is. The fact that you built three apps with a 5 month old is already impressive. Just ship one.",

Your site doesn't need to be perfect either! My first customer signed up, then cancelled immediately (I presume to stop his subscription from auto renewing) - but I made a mistake in my stripe cancellation logic so it ended his access immediately with no refund then he couldn't access my app! I stayed up until 4am trying to figure out how to use stripe to give him 1 month access and fix my code! haha thought that may cheer you up as a reminder that things don't have to be perfect, although I do recommend testing your payment logic properly! \n\nCatch up soon! - Paul",

Cloudron, Ploi, and a bunch of Laravel hosting companies proved this works really well.\n\n  \nFew thoughts from someone who's self-hosted a bunch of stuff on Hetzner:\n\n  \nThe 3.8x markup over raw Hetzner pricing is actually very reasonable when you factor in the time cost. I've spent entire weekends debugging config issues on self-hosted projects. If I billed that time at even a modest hourly rate, the managed pricing is a bargain.\n\n  \nOne thing I'd suggest thinking about: backup and migration tooling. The #1 fear people have with managed hosting is lock-in. If you can make it dead simple to export everything and spin up your own instance if they ever need to leave, that actually makes people MORE likely to stay (because they don't feel trapped).\n\n  \nAlso curious about your update pipeline. Are you doing blue-green deploys or just updating in place? Because OpenClaw has been moving fast and breaking changes aren't exactly confidence inspiring if you're running it for business use on WhatsApp/Slack.",

But I get that \"you can do it manually\" isn't the same as \"here's a button.\" Proper export/import tooling is on the list. So you can leave easily, but also bring an existing OpenClaw setup in without starting from scratch. The goal is exactly what you said: make leaving easy so people don't feel trapped.\n\n**Updates:** In-place, not blue-green. Blue-green would mean running two instances per customer which kills the economics at these price points. What I do instead is test updates on my own instances first, wait a few days for obvious breakage, then roll out to customers. Not bulletproof, but OpenClaw's been pretty stable lately. If something does break, I'm usually fixing it before most people notice.\n\nFor business-critical stuff on WhatsApp/Slack, customers will soon be able to disable auto-updates directly in their instance.

My Reddit karma scanner job silently failed for 3 days because I fat-fingered a config update. No errors, just... silence. Took me forever to realize it wasn't Reddit's API being flaky.\n\nQuick question: Does your managed hosting include monitoring/alerting for when jobs stop firing? That's the gap I keep running into with self-hosted -- I only know something broke when I manually check or someone (well, me) notices missing outputs.\n\nAlso curious about the upgrade path -- if someone starts on €19 tier and their cron jobs start hitting rate limits, is migration to higher tier seamless or does it require reconfiguration?\n\nThe Telegram/WhatsApp/Discord integrations out of the box is smart positioning. That's the first question anyone asks when I mention OpenClaw: \"Does it work with [my chat app]?\"",

Probably a daily digest email to start, real-time notifications later.\n\nTier upgrades: also planned to be seamless, not built yet. Right now it's manual through me. Same instance, I resize the VPS, your config and memory stay put. Few minutes downtime for the reboot.

I’ve been tinkering with voice synthesis for a while, and I finally built something good enough to share:\n\n[imiteo.com￼](https://imiteo.com/) — a voice cloning tool that can clone a voice from a short audio sample.\n\nThe workflow is simple:  \n  \n• Upload or record a voice clip (even a few seconds can work)  \n• The app transcribes it automatically  \n• Enter the text you want spoken  \n• Click generate, and get cloned audio back in seconds\n\nI’ve been genuinely surprised by how well it performs, even with short inputs. No registration, No email.\n\nIt currently supports 10 languages: English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, German, French, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian.\n\nLanguage detection is automatic, so you don’t need to manually pick the transcription language.\n\nIf you’re curious about the stack:\n\n• nextjs, react  \n• Front Cloudflare Worker  \n• GPU L4\n\nI’d really love feedback—what works, what doesn’t, and what you’d like to see next. I’m actively improving it, so any thoughts are super helpful.\n\nTry it here: [imiteo.com￼](https://imiteo.com/)\n\nWould love to hear what you think!",

I never send notes to Drive; I don't see the point. I already have the Remarkable app on my various devices, so it's pointless for me.\n\nThat's my workflow. Where I lose time (and maybe information) is with the transitions between handwriting (whiteboard or Remarkable) and organizing in Workflowy.",

I've definitely been in that \"build first, validate later\" trap.\n\nWhat I've learned from my own failed projects is that user complaints are gold, but the real trick is distinguishing between surface-level complaints and root causes. Someone might complain about a feature being hard to use, but the real issue is they're trying to accomplish something the tool wasn't designed for.\n\nYour export-to-AI approach is clever for pattern recognition. I'd be curious how you handle the signal-to-noise ratio though. Reddit complaints can be vocal minorities, or sometimes people complaining about the same thing in different ways. Do you do any deduplication or clustering before feeding it to Claude?\n\nOne thing that's helped me is combining complaint data with \"workaround analysis\" - looking at what hacky solutions people have cobbled together. That usually reveals what they really need vs. what they say they need.\n\nGreat execution on this. The JSON export feature makes it way more useful than just a searchable database.",

Again I am in anonymous/stealth helping you to crush your goals.  \n  \nIn this episode of \"Hold my beer\" I make a public bet that I can fix your main problem (by giving you some tough love) in one comment. It's a bit for fun, a bit for usefulness, a bit for you to mention what you are working on.\n\nThe problem doesn't have to be regarding your landing page or launch strategy, it can be regarding perfectionism or ADHD or anything else related to the struggles entrepreneurs face. But I am well aware that landing/launch is the main topic.\n\nRemember, that I am building a \"prior for you to paste into your LLM\" (a Google doc) to be able to fix common problems, so anything you share will be useful for you and others (and low-key spread the word about what you are working on).\n\n\\----------------\n\nSame protocol as before. Drop a comment with:  \n1. **The link**   \n2. **One-line description**  \n3. what's your main problem (only if you want to get a specific advice)\n\n\\----------------\n\nHere's the doc we are co-building: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fiorUPwm8e9YJeRjVF6pPLDnaQx3IM-82eRC\\_bbloh8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fiorUPwm8e9YJeRjVF6pPLDnaQx3IM-82eRC_bbloh8/edit?usp=sharing)   \nSuper tiny so far, but evolving.

Curious about the app store page, as well as the branding and copy. Also any general feedback on the idea/execution would be really helpful :)",
