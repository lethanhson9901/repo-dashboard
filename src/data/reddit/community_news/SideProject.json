              "text": "Looking busy and burning tokens is the number one problem with these kind of agent orchestration tools.\n\nThere are solutions more comprehensive than this that take it to an absurd degree. Take gastown. That project expects you to pay for multiple pro licences for claude code, and essentially shove a cool $5k into it in order for the chance it spits out some working software at the end of the week. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the approach is incredible, and it's not designed to be production ready or anything. But the tooling we get from these AI companies is absolutely not ready for this kind of thing. It's far far far too expensive, and unreliable. In gastown, the vast majority of tokens burned are just agents confirming what they already know and coordinating their messes. Until we see a real leap forward in terms of agentic orchestration, this problem is not going to go away, and it's actually a problem that gets exponentially worse the more you try to add safety. The more nodes you add, the more tokens it will burn just covering all the edges. \n\nBut I'm talking about software development specifically. Even without all this overhead, the AI is still awful at software. Maybe if the jobs these agents were doing were super simple, it could work. You mentioned posting on twitter. Could be useful to coordinate marketing drives that only take a few minutes of work to complete every day? ",

I have been building with AI agents for a while and the biggest lesson I learned is that the visual layer (desks, speech bubbles, green/yellow status) is fun but the hard part is always the same: how do you know agent output is actually correct?\n\n  \nWith 8 agents talking to each other you get compounding hallucination risk. Agent A summarizes something slightly wrong, Agent B builds on that summary, Agent C acts on it. By the time it reaches you, the error is buried three layers deep and looks totally plausible.\n\n  \nThe things that actually worked for me:\n\n  \n1. Keep agent chains short. Two agents max in a chain before a human checkpoint. The longer the chain the more garbage accumulates.\n\n  \n2. Make every agent write to a log you can audit, not just show a speech bubble. If you cant trace back why an agent did something, you cant trust it.\n\n  \n3. Token costs scale way faster than you expect with multi-agent setups. Each agent-to-agent conversation is burning context windows on both sides. I would track your daily spend closely for the first month.\n\n  \n4. The WhatsApp interface is smart though. Natural language commands with zero prompt engineering friction is underrated. Most agent frameworks make you write YAML configs or chain builders when honestly just texting instructions works better.\n\n  \nThe real question from the comments (what concrete output did they ship) is the right one to focus on. The architecture is cool but at the end of the day it comes down to: did the newsletter actually go out, was the research accurate, did the tweets perform. Would love to see a followup post with actual metrics after a month of running this.",

I recently did a project with agents, I made a whole company with ceo, legal, content writers, designers, project managers, CTO, architects, developers, qa, etc. I thought why not solve context by having each employee only care about what they need to like a real company. You can chat with any person in the company, and agents can chat with one another. Every person in the company keeps and manages their own documentation, work is prioritized by each level of stakeholder. You can run sprints or kanban, if work needs to happen, a pm steps in to make tasks, architects to draw up specs, cto to call tech shots. You can even use it with existing dev projects, there’s an onboarding phase where each agent develops their initial documentation. It works, but it’s way too autonomous. My security agents started spinning up dozens of tasks that I didn’t want, like it was some gigantic enterprise company. I need to tune it a bit to keep the spec from ballooning. \n\nI dropped the project last week because I have so much work already and I realized this was gonna take a lot more effort to get the process working. Also, I ended up having to write so many tool calls it was starting to feel dangerous. I wish Gemini had better tool call support. I love Claude but I want that larger context man!!!",

(It's just me with database access?)\n\nRealized: even a side project needs basic security stuff if you want business customers.\n\nEnded up spending a weekend actually documenting:\n\n* What data I collect and where it goes\n* How I secure it\n* What happens if something breaks\n* How customers can delete their data\n\nNot fancy. Just honest answers to reasonable questions.\n\nCustomer approved it. Still paying. And now when the next one asks, I have something to send.\n\nIf your side project is getting real users, spend a weekend thinking through security before someone asks. Future you will thank you.\n\nEDIT-1\n\nFound some tools to help out after this post. Some good ones are:\n\nShipSec Studio (github.com/shipsecai/studio) – Built by a fellow Redditor. It’s an open-source security orchestration platform that lets you build visual workflows for security audits and catch API leaks before a customer ever asks for your docs.\n\nSnyk (github.com/snyk) – The industry standard for scanning your package.json and Docker images. It catches vulnerable dependencies and provides automated fix PRs so security doesn't slow down your shipping speed.\n\nCompAI (github.com/trycompai/comp) – An open-source, AI-native alternative to Vanta/Drata. If you need to scale from a basic security markdown file to full SOC 2 or GDPR compliance, this automates the evidence collection and policy generation.",

The jump from \"I have users\" to \"I have business customers\" catches everyone off guard.\n\n  \nThe good news is your list is basically the right one. Most B2B buyers just want to know you have thought about security at all. They are not expecting SOC2 from a solo dev charging $49/month. They want to see you took it seriously enough to write it down.\n\n  \nA few things that helped me when I hit the same wall:\n\n  \n\\- Keep a simple security page on your site. Even a /security URL with plain language about how data is stored, who has access, how backups work, and how to request deletion. Most enterprise buyers will check this before even emailing you.\n\n  \n\\- For incident response, being honest about \"it is just me, I will fix it and communicate within 24 hours\" is actually fine at this stage. Companies appreciate honesty over a fake 50 page policy.\n\n  \n\\- The biggest unlock for me was realizing these questions are a buying signal, not a blocker. If their IT team is asking about your security, they have already decided they want to use your product. They just need to check the boxes.\n\n  \nAlso worth knowing: once you have that doc, it saves you hours on every future customer. I have sent the same doc to maybe 8 different companies now with minor tweaks. It compounds.\n\n  \nCongrats on the first paying customer. The fact that their IT team is doing due diligence means you are selling to real companies, which is exactly where you want to be.",

      "text": "**What it does**\n\nYou type in an idea, a product, or just an industry name. The engine searches the internet for articles, reports, and filings that point to real financial losses. Regulatory fines, court settlements, workforce data. Then it structures everything into a report: who's losing money, how much, and what a fix could look like.\n\nThink of it as automated market research. Same thing a consulting firm would do for $50K. Except it takes 3 minutes and costs me about $0.50 per scan in API calls.\n\n**The numbers**\n\n* 40,000+ documented business problems\n* 300+ industries\n* 8 countries\n* 6 months of building\n* \\~$5,000 in API costs (Perplexity for research, Claude for analysis)\n\n**Tech stack**\n\n* Python backend (FastAPI)\n* Next.js frontend\n* Perplexity API for sourcing\n* Claude API for structuring and analysis\n* Supabase (Postgres)\n* Hosted on a single DigitalOcean droplet\n\n**Here are 10 ideas the engine found. Every dollar figure traces back to a public source.**\n\n**1. HVAC Compliance Tracking**\n\nEPA Section 608 requires HVAC companies to document refrigerant leak inspections. Most still use paper logs. When auditors show up, incomplete records mean fines of $15,000-$50,000 per violation per year.\n\nHVAC companies are 5-15 person shops. The owner is on a roof, not evaluating software. But one failed audit wipes out a month of profit.\n\n**The fix:** Simple mobile app for technicians to log inspections on-site. Auto-generates compliance reports. $99/month per company.\n\n**2. Restaurant Menu Pricing**\n\nRestaurants lose 5-10% of food sales revenue because they price dishes by gut feel instead of tracking actual ingredient costs, portion drift, and waste. Many menu items are priced below break-even and the owner has no idea.\n\nRestaurant owners are chefs, not accountants. Existing POS systems track sales but not true plate-level costs with real-time ingredient pricing.\n\n**The fix:** Menu pricing optimizer that connects to supplier invoices and calculates real margin per dish. Flags items losing money. $149/month.\n\n**3. Physician Prior Authorization**\n\nDoctors spend 13-15 hours per week. Not per month. **Per week.** On prior authorizations. The average practice submits 39-41 per week. The AMA puts the industry-wide waste at $437 million annually on this one bottleneck.\n\nI had to re-read this three times. Cross-checked the AMA numbers against a MGMA report. Same ballpark. This is real money being burned because insurance companies profit from the friction. They have zero incentive to fix it.\n\n**The fix:** AI that pre-fills auth forms, predicts denial likelihood, and auto-appeals. $200-500/month per physician.\n\n**4. Car Dealership F&I Compliance**\n\nThe FTC has been hitting dealerships for Finance & Insurance disclosure violations. Hidden fees, junk add-ons, misleading payment presentations. Average settlement: $2.6 million per case. The CARS Rule (effective 2025) made this even more dangerous.\n\nDealership software is dominated by CDK and Reynolds & Reynolds. Neither has built proactive compliance checking into F&I workflows. Dealers are flying blind.\n\n**The fix:** Compliance checker that reviews deal jackets before signing. Flags disclosure gaps. $500-1,000/month per rooftop.\n\n**5. Trucking HOS Fine Prevention**\n\nThe trucking industry pays $30.7 million per year in Hours of Service and ELD violations. Individual fines: $300 to $16,000 per violation. Small carriers get hit hardest because they can't afford compliance officers.\n\nHere's the thing. ELD mandates solved the recording problem but not the planning problem. Drivers still get jammed because dispatchers assigned loads without checking available hours.\n\n**The fix:** Smart dispatch layer that checks HOS availability before assigning loads. Alerts before violations happen, not after. $50/truck/month.\n\n**6. Childcare Provider Financial Planning**\n\nFederal childcare stabilization grants expired September 2023. Providers lost $50,000-$300,000 in annual funding overnight. With 5-10% margins, thousands are closing or cutting staff.\n\nThis one hit different. The grants didn't slowly wind down. They just stopped. Providers went from \"we're fine\" to \"we might close\" in one quarter. The ones surviving are doing it on spreadsheets and prayer.\n\n**The fix:** Financial planning SaaS for childcare centers. Revenue forecasting, enrollment optimization, grant tracking. $79-199/month.\n\n**7. Optometry Frame Inventory**\n\nEye care practices lose $2,000-$10,000 per month from frame stockouts. Customer comes in, wants a specific frame, it's not in stock, they walk. Most practices track inventory manually or with generic retail software.\n\nBig inventory players (Lightspeed, Square) don't handle optical-specific needs. PD measurements tied to frame selection, insurance-covered vs. retail frames, try-on tracking. Classic vertical SaaS gap.\n\n**The fix:** Optical-specific inventory management. Demand prediction, auto-reorder, vendor integration. $199/month per location.\n\n**8. Grocery Store Labor Scheduling**\n\nGrocery stores waste up to 12% of total labor costs from scheduling mismatches. Overstaffed when it's slow, understaffed at peaks. For a store doing $15M/year with 10% labor costs, that's $180,000 wasted annually.\n\nGeneral scheduling tools (Deputy, When I Work) don't account for grocery-specific patterns. Delivery truck schedules, promotional events, weather impacts, department-level staffing.\n\n**The fix:** AI scheduling built for grocery. Integrates with POS traffic data and delivery schedules. $299-499/month per store.\n\n**9. Behavioral Health Recruiting**\n\n122 million Americans live in designated Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas. Therapy practices lose $50,000-$200,000 per year in unrealized revenue because they can't hire qualified counselors. The demand exists. The supply doesn't.\n\nGeneric job boards don't work here. Behavioral health hiring needs license verification, specialty matching (CBT, DBT, EMDR), insurance panel status, supervision requirements for pre-licensed therapists. Indeed doesn't handle any of that.\n\n**The fix:** Recruiting platform for behavioral health. License-aware matching, credential verification, panel tracking. Placement fees or subscription.\n\n**10. EMS Controlled Substance Tracking**\n\nAmbulance services manage controlled substance inventories (narcotics, sedatives) that expire and need DEA-compliant chain-of-custody documentation. Manual tracking leads to expired drugs on rigs, compliance violations, and waste.\n\nPaper logs. For DEA-tracked narcotics. In 2025. I thought I was misreading the source.\n\n**The fix:** Digital chain-of-custody tracking for EMS. Scan-based logging, expiration alerts, automatic DEA reporting. $199/month per agency.\n\n**The honest part**\n\nIs every number here 100% bulletproof? No. AI can hallucinate. A source can be outdated. I beat myself up over this for months. Didn't want to show it to anyone.\n\nThen I thought about it differently. How would a human do this research? They'd go online, read articles, cross-reference data, pull out numbers. Exact same process. Just a thousand times slower and more expensive. The tradeoff is you need to verify what matters before betting money on it. Which you should do with a $50K consulting report too.\n\n**Where I'm stuck**\n\nThe engine works. The data is there. But I have no idea who my customer is or what the product should be. A searchable database? Per-industry reports? An API? A done-for-you analysis?\n\nRight now the site has a free scanner. You type your idea, it runs the full pipeline, and gives you a teaser. Full reports are paid but I'm still figuring out pricing and packaging.\n\nIf anyone's been through this \"I built a thing but don't know who it's for\" phase, I'd love advice.\n\n**Site:** [unfairgaps.com](https://unfairgaps.com/)",

          "text": "The \"I built it but who's it for\" phase is one of the hardest parts. A few thoughts from seeing others go through this:\n\n  \nYour biggest risk right now is trying to be everything to everyone. The engine covers 305 industries, which sounds impressive, but it makes it harder for any one person to feel like it's built for them.\n\n  \nPick ONE vertical and go deep. The physician prior auth idea alone is a $200-500/mo per doctor product. That's your signal. Instead of selling access to 4,410 problems, sell ONE curated report to ONE type of buyer.\n\n  \nThree customer segments that would pay for this:\n\n  \n1. Solo founders looking for validated ideas. They don't want a database, they want someone to say \"build this, here's proof it'll work.\" Package it as a $49 one-time \"find my startup idea\" product. The free scanner already does this, just make the output more actionable.\n\n  \n2. VC analysts doing market research. They spend weeks validating pain points before writing checks. If you can show them verified loss data in a specific sector, that's worth real money. Reach out to 10 early stage funds and offer a free sample report.\n\n  \n3. Existing SaaS founders pivoting or expanding. Someone already selling to HVAC companies might want to know about the EPA compliance gap. That's cross-sell intelligence.\n\n  \nOn pricing: $39 one-time for a database is leaving money on the table. The real value here isn't the data, it's the ongoing discovery. New fines and settlements happen every week. A subscription makes more sense, but position it as \"we find the opportunities, you build the solutions\" rather than \"here's a database.\"\n\n  \nThe fact that you're honest about AI hallucination risk is actually a feature, not a bug. Lean into that. \"We find the signals, you verify before betting money\" is a more trustworthy pitch than \"guaranteed opportunities.\"\n\n  \nStart talking to 20 people in one of those segments. Not pitching, just asking what they'd want from a tool like this. The answer will tell you exactly what to build next.",

But you're right, 40,000 problems mean nothing to an individual buyer.\n\n\n\nWorking with venture analysts is interesting. I'm currently going through acceleration, and one of the consultants promised to connect me with a representative of a venture firm. I also think my work would be useful to them.\n\n\n\nI'll start with the solo founder segment, since I can test it there the fastest. The scanner already exists; we just need to come to a conclusion more like \"this is what needs to be built and why,\" rather than \"here's a data wall.\"\n\n\n\nIn fact, I can easily get overwhelmed; there are too many possible developments. So I grit my teeth and do it.",

Most of the ingredients go into multiple dishes and small businesses are bad at estimating, or even taking their time inputting everything. For example they need potatoes in half of their dishes, they estimate how much potatoes each dish need. At the end of the day, they served X plates, but used 50% more potatoes. They got clueless and just stop using software. Also quality of ingredient matters, so sometimes you have small potatoes where you basically cut half of them away, sometimes you have good large ones.  \n  \nIf you really want to have per-dish cost you need person who wants to do this, spend their time investigating why today they used more potatoes than yesterday. Re-calculating frequently. Changing how much each dish needs based on previous results and uncertainties. Most small owners don’t want to do this. And those that do, can do it in excel. Larger kitchens that serve a lot of food cheaply have dedicated staff for it.  \n  \nno 8 is bullshit, that’s why nobody is trying to solve it. You *don’t* want more staff when there are more customers, because when you have a lot of customers, you don’t want to restock shelves, as that makes your store even more cramped and your customers have worse shopping experience, as they can’t go through aisles easily and pick up items they want. So in peak hours, you need more cashiers and in slower hours you restock shelves. Slowest day is sanitary day, when you scrub everything religiously. Since same people can do all three, you just shift them where they are needed the most. Cleaning shelves in peak times is NOT a good idea.  \n  \nBut good exercise on your part. If you truly want to do any of these, find someone who actually does this and talk to them, what they would pay for and try to describe to them, what they would actually need to do even if you wrote perfect software",

But I do have a question tho, sorry if it sounds dumb (i've never worked in retail slash retail adjacent stuff) but how would you know when is a peak hour and when is a slow hour, doesn't it always change thruout the year? Like I get it weekends will obviously be more rush than weekdays, but like you never know when 10 new customers start showing up on a random wednesday everytime from next week right? Also, aren't the restockers different from the cleaners and that different from the cashiers? Like I would assume all of these people are doin different works and sticking their designated job right, not sharing responsibilities or am I just dumb? Also, lastly, couldn't we just straight up go Elon (on Twitter) on these by just replacing 80% of the workforce with robotics (by let's say mid 2030s)?",

                  "text": "\nnot bad questions at all!  \n1. same people do everything. That’s why retail job is so hard, because you have multiple responsibilities. Larger stores usually have part time workers that only do single task (cashiers, people to restock items), but these only handle “baseload” demand, any peaks and lows are handled by full time employees  \n2. peaks are usually well defined. Hours when people are going home from work. Weekends (Fridays and Saturdays). Holidays. You know them and expect them. Of course there are some slight variation, like you said 10 people decide to go shopping to your store, but thanks to law of large numbers, it evens out over few days. “Law of large numbers” is that if you throw a dice one time, you can have any result from 1 to 6 with same chance. But if you throw dice hundred of times, it’s very unlikely you will throw sum close to 100 or 600, it will most likely be somewhere near the middle. Same with shoppings. Some may decide to come today, some new customers may decide to go to competitor, but since you have thousands of customers it evens out to some average. Sure, some days are slightly stronger than others for no reason, but you just push some work day or two, because you won’t have 10 or 20 unexpected strong days in a row. There will be slow days and you’ll catch up, re stock shelves and do all the maintenance needed.  \n3. retail work is very flexible. For example letting your shelves be completely empty and then restock it is much more efficient, but also may result in customers leaving compared to restocking frequently. What that means is that if you have several strong days in a row and you are unable to do everything you should (for example you didn’t restock shelves for two days), it is then less work to catch up, but if it took too long you might lose some customers. But generally if you should check vegetables every two hours and you check it every 2,5 hours, nothing bad happens. If you should have sanitary day once per week and you do it on 8. day, store won’t rot. If you restock your shelves slightly less frequently, change is barely noticeable for customers. That means, when you have more customers than you expected, you just do work less often and usually it makes no difference until it is really bad. But in normal operations, you just catch up later and catching up is easy, you won’t have twice as much work if you don’t do everything you should one day",

Privacy as a feature resonating harder in Germany than the US makes total sense, and it probably extends to most of the DACH region. If you translate to German, you might want to also look at Austrian and Swiss tech communities since they share that same privacy-first mindset.\n\n  \nAlso the pattern you described where the growth came from a random tweet and a blog finding you organically rather than your own promotion efforts is so common it should be a law. Building something genuinely useful and then just being present and helpful in communities seems to work better than any launch strategy. Your Product Hunt ranking vs the organic blog pickup is a perfect example.\n\n  \nThe Flutter + C++ combo for keeping the binary small is a good call. Electron apps have trained people to accept 200MB for a text editor so when something launches in under a second and stays under 30MB it immediately feels different.\n\n  \nCurious about the Windows beta, are you seeing similar adoption patterns there or is it still early? And have you considered reaching out to privacy-focused publications directly since that angle clearly resonates with your audience?",

The problem you identified (resume editing on the go without 300MB bloatware) is one of those frustrations that feels obvious once someone points it out.\n\nWhat stood out to me: you validated demand before building anything complex. Starting with a simple, offline-first MVP and charging only on mobile is smart positioning. Most PDF tools went the opposite direction -- adding features until they became too heavy to justify.\n\nCurious about your tech stack choice. Did you build native or go cross-platform (Electron/Tauri)? I'm working on a B2B SaaS product and constantly weighing the offline-first vs cloud-sync tradeoff. For enterprise clients, having both is often non-negotiable, but for consumer tools like yours, the offline angle is clearly a differentiator.\n\nAlso interested in how you handled mobile payments. One-time purchase vs subscription is a positioning choice that affects LTV math significantly. Did you A/B test pricing or go with gut instinct?\n\nKeep shipping!",

You accidentally built something way more interesting than a Divoom clone.\n\n  \nThe fact that you went C++ for the rendering layer and Node.js as the app brain is a solid architecture choice. Keeping the apps web-based means anyone can build for it without learning embedded stuff, which is exactly what would make this viable as a product.\n\n  \nMoving to a custom PCB is where things get real though. That is a completely different game from prototyping with a Pi. If you have not already, look into getting a few quotes from PCBWay or JLCPCB early even if the design is not final. Knowing your per-unit cost at different volumes will tell you a lot about whether the product math works.\n\n  \nOne thing I would think about: the knob-based navigation is a killer feature for a desk device. No one wants to pull out their phone to change what is on their desk display. That physical interaction is what separates this from just being a small monitor.",

Its been a very hard journey building this alone in my room going from one prototype to another and porting code from one infra to another figuring out what is the best way to do this without none to take advice from and share progress with. I planned to make this video like 2 months ago but felt so underconfident that this is not ready I shouldn't but recently my whole life went upside down left my job, had a breakup, health went other way. I decided to make this video just a way to respect to honor my efforts so far that I have put in.\n\nTbh I don't really care whether anyone would like this or not but I'm gonna make sure I see this project till the end and I have something on my desk that I truly built because I wanted to.  Not because someone told me to, not because someone told me it's not gonna work, not because someone told me this idea is bad , not because I realized this is going to be a long and hard journey from idea to actual product. There have been times I have been stuck on solving a bug for weeks but never really gave up because this time I just wanted to go all the way and that's what I'm gonna do.\n\nThanks for this comment.

This is the very first version that uses a motor to keep the slinky moving forever. It was a lot of trial and error to get the timing right!\n\nThe next version will include a small computer (Arduino or ESP32) with sensors to adjust the speed automatically.\n\nMy dream is to create a real product from this. I’m documenting the whole build process and my progress on YouTube.\n\nFollow the journey here: [https://www.youtube.com/@Mr.Slinky3D](https://www.youtube.com/@Mr.Slinky3D)\n\nI would love to hear your feedback or ideas!",

      "text": "I am currently building a one-man app studio. I build SaaS apps for myself, for clients, and recently I've partnered with CEOs who have domain expertise but no tech team - I build it, they run it. That means I'm usually juggling 2-3 projects at once, and I don't have weeks to spend on each one.\n\nRight now I can go from a two-sentence app idea to a working, deployed (high-quality, tested, etc.) product in a few days.\n\nHere's how the system works.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n* I wrote a reusable playbook that lives in `~/.claude/` and travels with me across every project\n* New project starts with a heavy interview - AI asks me 15+ questions about the business, users, design, architecture, etc.\n* Answers get turned into structured docs (schema, architecture, business rules, design system)\n* A phased roadmap gets generated with checkboxes, and the AI works through it while I review every commit\n\n# The problem\n\nAI models like Opus-4.6 and Codex-5.3 are incredibly powerful, but they have blind spots. They don't know your domain, your schema, your business rules, or what they built yesterday. On simple projects this doesn't matter - they can one-shot a landing page or build a simple MVP, but on anything real, the quality deteriorates. They make assumptions, contradict earlier decisions, and build in the wrong direction - often forgetting important details. You can end up spending more time correcting the AI than you would've spent just writing the code yourself.\n\n# The fix: a portable documentation system\n\nI built a reusable playbook that lives outside any project (*of note, I build all of my web/SaaS apps using the same Rails/Inertia/React stack with the same libraries and tools)*:\n\n      ~/.claude/\n      ├── CLAUDE.md                    # Routes to everything below\n      ├── rails-playbook/\n      │   ├── README.md                # Conventions index\n      │   ├── auth.md                  # Authentication\n      │   ├── brand-interview.md       # 15-question project interview\n      │   ├── inertia-react.md         # Frontend setup\n      │   ├── solid-stack.md           # Queue, cache, cable\n      │   ├── stripe-payments.md       # Billing integration\n      │   ├── heroku-deploy.md         # Deployment\n      │   ├── analytics-seo.md         # Analytics & SEO\n      │   ├── email-verification.md    # Email flows\n      │   ├── settings-page.md         # User settings\n      │   ├── contact-page.md          # Contact forms\n      │   ├── legal-pages.md           # Terms, privacy\n      │   ├── logo-generation.md       # Brand assets\n      │   ├── env-template.md          # Environment variables\n      │   └── project-structure.md     # Directory layout\n    \n\nThe `CLAUDE.md` file is basically a table of contents. Claude reads it at the start of every session and knows where to find patterns for auth, payments, deployment, frontend architecture - whatever applies. Each project only pulls what it needs.\n\n# Interview first, code second\n\nWhen I start a new project, I spend a good chunk of time running an interview covering the business model, user types, core workflows, design preferences, edge cases, etc. The AI asks the questions and I answer in plain English.\n\nThose answers get turned into structured project docs folder:\n\n* `SCHEMA.md` \\- every table, column, relationship, index\n* `ARCHITECTURE.md` \\- technical decisions, service patterns, key flows\n* `BUSINESS_RULES.md` \\- domain logic, permissions, edge cases\n* `DESIGN.md` \\- colors, typography, component patterns\n* `CODE_QUALITY.md` \\- rules for clean, maintainable code\n* `TESTING.md` \\- test principles and conventions\n* `VIEWS.md` \\- UI specification, layouts, routes, role-based access\n* `INERTIA_RAILS.md` \\- frontend/backend integration patterns\n* `PROJECT_SETUP.md` \\- local dev and deployment\n* `ROADMAP.md` \\- phased implementation plan\n* `CLAUDE.md` \\- project-level AI instructions\n\nThese docs become the project's source of truth. Every time the AI starts a task, it reads them.\n\n# The roadmap engine\n\nThe roadmap is the holy source of truth. For my current project (a multi-tenant incident management system for property restoration), the roadmap has 9 phases and 153 checkboxes. Each phase builds on the last, adds tests, code reviews, etc:\n\n1. Foundation (firing up the app, auth, creating model, permissions)\n2. Properties (CRUD, assignments, scoping)\n3. Incidents core (creation, dashboard, status transitions)\n4. Communication (messages, contacts, notifications)\n5. Field operations (labor, equipment tracking)\n6. Documentation (notes, attachments, daily logs)\n7. Reporting\n8. E2E testing\n9. Polish & deploy\n\nThe AI works through the roadmap phase by phase. It checks off items as they're completed, adds notes about decisions made, and references which docs informed each choice. When I come back to a project after a few days, I don't have to remember where I left off - the roadmap tells me.\n\n# The hooks\n\nAfter every commit, a post-commit hook automatically runs against the changed files. It checks:\n\n* **Linters** \\- ESLint, TypeScript, RuboCop\n* **Design system** \\- no hardcoded colors, no raw `<button>` or `<input>` (use the component library), no border radius violations\n* **Architecture rules** \\- no N+1 database queries, no frontend date formatting, no hardcoded routes, no data aggregation on the client\n\n# I still review everything\n\nI review every commit. The system asks for permission before running commands, and I read the diffs before approving. I could bypass the permission prompts and let it run fully autonomous, but I want oversight.\n\nWhen something looks wrong, I catch it in review and course-correct. The playbook means those corrections are rare because the AI already knows the patterns, but they still happen. \n\n# What's next\n\nThe system keeps getting better as I add to it. Some things I'm exploring:\n\n* **Figma MCP** \\- plugging Figma directly into the workflow so the AI can reference actual design mockups instead of just written design tokens\n* **Image generation MCP** \\- using tools like Nano Banana to generate brand logos, marketing images, and SVGs during the brand interview phase instead of stubbing them out\n* **Better hooks** \\- The hooks don't catch as much as they should in terms of code that goes against the code quality docs. Not sure why, but these need improvement\n* **Faster service integrations**  \\- automating the boring setup steps like buying domains, wiring up error monitoring, and configuring API keys across environments\n\n# Results\n\nI've shipped four projects so far using this system and in 95% less time than it would've taken me 6 months ago. The code is consistent across projects because the playbook enforces the same patterns. New features land faster because the AI already knows the architecture instead of me re-explaining it every session.\n\nEvery project is a new learning experience and I'm continuously refining the playbooks and setup. Maybe one day I'll get it to one-shot complex apps with a one sentence prompt.\n\n---\nIf you're looking for a project to build and test your own system on, I have a whole database of ideas at https://cloneabledb.com/ - each idea comes with all the information you need to get started",

Here is an excerpt\n\n    ## Working Style\n    \n    - **Interview first** - Ask about project/requirements before coding\n    - **Never assume, always ask** - If something doesn't make sense for the project (e.g. adding OAuth when it wasn't discussed, setting up Stripe for a free app, adding features not requested), stop and ask. Don't add things \"just in case\" or because the playbook mentions them. Every piece of code should have a clear reason to exist for THIS project.\n    - **Be fully clear on the task** - Before starting work, make sure you understand exactly what's needed. If instructions are ambiguous or you're unsure whether something applies, ask rather than guessing. A quick question saves hours of unwanted work.\n    - **Only build what's requested** - Don't add extra integrations, services, or infrastructure beyond what the project actually needs. The playbook is a menu, not a checklist.\n    - **Use claude-mem** - Check memory before expensive searches\n    - **Use Context7** - Check docs before implementing libraries",

              "text": "This actually makes a lot of sense and it's closer to what PocketPaw already does than you might think.\n\nThe pieces you're describing, we have most of them:\n\n\\- Self-hosted LLM: Ollama is supported but need more testing. Auto-detects your local instance, no API keys needed. We have plans to make Ollama and local model support first class.\n\n\\- MCP support: PocketPaw connects to MCP servers (stdio + HTTP). So your custom MCPs that process and serve data, those would plug straight in.\n\n\\- Scheduling: Built-in cron scheduler with natural language parsing. \"Every 6 hours, check the latest data and decide if anything needs action\" is a valid prompt. It's not a rigid n8n-style flow, it's literally just prompting the agent on a schedule and letting it decide what to do.\n\n\\- Mission Control(Deep Work): This is probably the piece you're actually looking for. It doesn't just run a fixed pipeline. It takes a goal, breaks it into tasks, runs agents, and makes decisions based on what comes back. So if your MCP returns anomalous data, the agent can decide to investigate further, trigger another process, or flag you.\n\nThe \"autonomous agent that makes decisions based on the data it's getting\" is exactly the use case Mission Control was built for. The difference from n8n is that there's no flow to draw. You describe what you want and the agent figures out the steps.\n\nThat said, I want to be honest, we're still early. This is beta, things will break, APIs might change between versions. The core loop works and people are using it daily, but if you're building something production-critical I'd say kick the tires first and give feedback on what's rough. Early adopter input is what shapes where this goes.\n\nWould be curious what kind of data your MCPs are processing. If you want to try wiring it up I'm happy to help you get the MCP config right.",

Still navigates anywhere though. Tracking WebMCP (Chrome 146 Canary) for structured website interaction down the road.\n* `--break-system-packages -` fallback for distros blocking pip outside venvs. Fair catch, should be more explicit about when it triggers.\n* Desktop screenshots - off by default, only activates if user enables desktop tools.\n\nOn prompt injection - yeah, not bulletproof. Injection scanner + Guardian AI (separate LLM review) + fail-closed on uncertainty is the best we can do today. Adversarial prompts are an unsolved problem industry-wide.\n\nIf you spot specific injection vectors, would appreciate an issue on GitHub.",

The one you personally use the most. Ignore the other two completely for now. Then give yourself one single evening to just slap in the simplest possible paywall. It does not have to be perfect. RevenueCat or even just a basic StoreKit setup with one tier. Ship it with the ugliest paywall you can live with. You can always polish it later but you cannot iterate on something that is not in the store.\n\n  \nThe \"no budget for ads\" thing is actually fine. Most indie apps get their first 50-100 users from a single Reddit or HN launch post and word of mouth from friends already on TestFlight. You already have friends using it daily so you are ahead of most people at this stage.\n\n  \nAlso congrats on the new kid. Sleep deprivation makes everything feel 10x harder than it actually is. The fact that you built three apps with a 5 month old is already impressive. Just ship one.",

It's easy to get overwhelmed! \n\nI just launched my first app i've spent a year coding and when the first paid customers came in, the feeling was amazing and made the efforts worth it! Your site doesn't need to be perfect either! My first customer signed up, then cancelled immediately (I presume to stop his subscription from auto renewing) - but I made a mistake in my stripe cancellation logic so it ended his access immediately with no refund then he couldn't access my app! I stayed up until 4am trying to figure out how to use stripe to give him 1 month access and fix my code! haha thought that may cheer you up as a reminder that things don't have to be perfect, although I do recommend testing your payment logic properly! \n\nCatch up soon! - Paul",

That takes time, but that's what's many are struggling with and will make stand out, you dont have just a local project but areal product. \nTry to block one day and say: “Today, I will just start the paywall for X app. That’s it.”\n\nAnd with a newborn baby, it’s definitely not easy.

I had almost the exact same situation — app working great on my own devices, a couple friends using it, and then just... paralysis when it came to actually shipping.\n\nWhat finally got me moving was reframing the problem. I was treating \"launch\" as this big event that needed to be perfect — polished paywall, App Store screenshots, a landing page, maybe a Product Hunt launch. But in reality, nobody cares about your v1.0 launch. Nobody is watching. And that's actually liberating.\n\nHere's what I'd suggest for the new-dad-zero-energy situation:\n\n1. \\*\\*Ship one app this weekend with the simplest possible paywall.\\*\\* RevenueCat + a single \"Pro\" tier. Don't overthink pricing. $2.99/month or $19.99/year. You can always change it later. The goal is just to remove the mental block of \"it's not ready.\"\n\n2. \\*\\*Skip marketing entirely for now.\\*\\* Just get it on the App Store. Real users trickle in from App Store search alone — slowly, but it happens. You'll get organic feedback without lifting a finger on social media.\n\n3. \\*\\*The LLM cost concern is real but solvable.\\*\\* Set a daily/monthly usage cap for free users. Even something like 10 queries/day is generous enough for casuals and keeps your costs predictable.\n\nThe other two apps? Don't even think about them right now. Shipping one will give you the momentum to ship the rest. The \"last 10%\" gets easier every time you do it because you realize the stakes are way lower than your anxiety tells you.\n\nCongrats on the baby btw — the fact that you built 3 working apps with a 5-month-old is already impressive. Most people can't even ship one with unlimited free time.",

Fighting copycats was pointless.\n\nSo I flipped the script: instead of protecting my code, I started selling it.\n\nI packaged my codebase into [Dirstarter](https://dirstarter.com), a Next.js boilerplate for building directory websites. Took about a week – 2 days to clean up the code, 5 days for landing page and docs.\n\n**The crazy part:** I got my first sales on day one without posting anywhere. Just added a small link on OpenAlternative and sales started flowing. People had been asking about my tech stack for months – there was already pent-up demand.\n\n**Current numbers:**\n\n* \\~$5,000/month revenue\n* \\~200 customers\n* Pricing: $159 / $199 (started at $97, raised it twice)\n* Still solo, no employees\n\n**What's working for marketing:**\n\n* 30% affiliate commissions (best ROI channel)\n* OpenAlternative as a \"living demo\" of what the boilerplate can do\n* Building in public on Twitter\n\n**Main lesson:** Your existing projects can become new products. I didn't plan to sell a boilerplate – it emerged from something I was already running. Look at what you've built. Is anyone asking how you did it? That might be your next product.\n\nHappy to answer questions about the journey, pricing decisions, or anything else!",

A directory boilerplate that saves someone weeks of work and comes with a proven architecture is easily worth $200+.\n\n  \nAlso love that your best marketing channel is the product itself. OpenAlternative as a living demo is way more convincing than any landing page could be. People can see exactly what they are buying before they pay. That removes almost all purchase friction.\n\n  \nThe broader takeaway for anyone reading: pay attention to the questions people keep asking you. \"What tech stack is this?\" and \"How did you build this?\" are literally people telling you what they want to buy.

Gotta be efficient with space while keeping quality and original resolution. A 340mb ProRes 422 becomes a 3Mb file. \nOf course your final output is some kind of MP4 so it will be relatively slim. Anyways, I will process it via FFmpeg myself to save even more space.\n\nA couple of things. I noticed on an intel mac I had - i recorded the screen via the competing app and click+drag to mark files in the app - had a super long delay, the highlighting rectangle animated in 1sec delay from the mouse. Not sure if that's a petformance thing with intel but note that when you continue developing..as I have a feeling all these mouse cursor smoothing etc may create some delays / sync problems.

      "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI built a podcast app last year and had no clue how to market it. No budget. No audience. I tried posting on TikTok a couple of times and got like 200 views. Honestly, I almost gave up on the platform.\n\nThen I found a workflow that actually worked. In one week, I hit 4.4 million views. No paid ads. No lucky viral moment. Just a boring, repeatable process built around TikTok slideshows. You don't even need to show your face.\n\nHere's what I did, step by step :\n\n\\# Step 1: Research Your Niche\n\nTikTok isn't one big audience. It's thousands of tiny subcultures. I spent time figuring out exactly where my target users hang out. Not broad topics. Hyper-specific communities that actually care about what I'm building. The more specific you get, the better your content will land.\n\n\\# Step 2: Warm Up Your Account (Don't Skip This)\n\nThis is the most important part. Before you post anything, spend 3 to 5 days just being a normal user. Every day, for about 10 to 15 minutes, search for keywords in your niche. Filter by newest posts. Like stuff. Follow people. Leave comments.\n\nYou're training your For You Page so TikTok knows what niche you belong to. If you skip this step, your first posts will go nowhere.\n\n\\# Step 3: Post Once a Day, One Format Per Account\n\nAfter the warm-up, I posted one slideshow every day. One big rule here: stick to one content format per account. If you want to test videos and slideshows, make separate accounts. TikTok rewards consistency.\n\n\\# Step 4: The Slideshow Formula\n\nThis is where things get interesting. Here's what I learned after dozens of posts.\n\n\\*\\*Your hook matters more than anything else.\\*\\* The first slide has one job: make people stop scrolling. Write it in first person so it feels like a personal story. Make it curious, a little controversial, or call out something your audience relates to. If they don't stop, nothing else matters.\n\n\\*\\*Keep your visuals consistent.\\*\\* Every post should look like it belongs on the same account. I used dark, moody images because they make text easy to read. I pulled images from Pinterest but always edited them before uploading. Pinterest images have invisible tags that TikTok can flag, which kills your reach.\n\n\\*\\*A few production tips that really matter:\\*\\*\n\n\\* Use TikTok's built-in font and add your text inside the app. Don't use Canva or other design tools for this.\n\n\\* Post directly through the app. Don't use scheduling tools. They seem to hurt how far your posts go.\n\n\\* Images with people on the first slide tend to do better.\n\n\\*\\*Reply to every comment.\\*\\* When you reply, TikTok sends the person a notification. That brings them back to your post, which boosts engagement and tells the algorithm to push it further.\n\n\\*\\*Just keep posting.\\*\\* My first 5 to 10 posts flopped. That's totally normal. Keep going. When something finally hits, make variations of that post and double down.\n\n\\# What Happened\n\nAfter one week of doing this every day: 4.4 million views, a growing follower base, and +2000 signups. All without spending a dollar.\n\nLook, this isn't some sexy growth hack. It's manual work. It takes patience, especially when your early posts flop. But it's free and it works.\n\nHappy to answer any questions. Drop them below and I'll try to get to all of them.\n\n!\\[img\\](98orwcamwyig1 \"Analytics from my TikTok account\")",

If you skip that step, the algorithm has no idea who you are and your posts just get scattered to random people.\n\n  \nThe reply-to-every-comment strategy is also way more powerful than people realize. I noticed the same thing when I started being intentional about responding to every single person on my posts. Each reply is basically you re-requesting attention from that user, plus the algorithm sees the engagement spike and thinks the content is worth pushing further. Double benefit.\n\n  \nOne question though, did you notice a difference in performance between slideshows with more personal/storytelling hooks vs ones that were more listicle or tip-based? Curious if the format that got the most views also drove the most actual signups or if there was a disconnect there.",

That cut my average session cost by maybe 30-40% because it stops the agent from vacuuming up every file in the repo before doing anything useful.\n\n  \nThe sub-agent tree visualization sounds especially useful. When you're running agent teams, the interleaved output in the terminal becomes genuinely unreadable past 3-4 concurrent agents.\n\n  \nGoing to check out the repo.

The biggest limitation of most AI chat interfaces is that everything gets flattened into markdown, which works fine for text but completely falls apart when you need to actually interact with the output. Tables you cant sort, charts you cant zoom, data you cant copy cleanly.\n\n  \nRendering actual UI components is the right direction. Curious about a few things:\n\n  \nHow do you handle the boundary between what the AI generates vs what gets rendered? Like if the model outputs something unexpected, does it degrade gracefully or does the whole response break?\n\n  \nAlso, is the component set fixed (charts, tables, etc) or can the AI decide to render arbitrary components? The former is way more stable but the latter is way more interesting.\n\n  \nNice work making it open source too. Thats the kind of project where community contributions could really expand the component library fast.",

However, LLMs have come a long way since then, and they're now capable of producing really good looking software amd websites. So, I thought I would love to introduce that to the normal conversation. To answer your questions so far the components it can use are fixed, they're basically the most basic fundamental components such as: Tables, charts, stepers, card, etc. it offer stability and so far it never broke, since the LLM output is basically json format and then the app translate that into UI components. And if the model output something that the app didn't understand then it will just get shown as text, so theoretically there's no way the response could break the app. In the future I am thinking about letting the AI generate the components arbitrarily, but as you said it will probably be less stable since it's prone to hallucinations.\n\nEdit: typo.",

You know, normal developer stuff.\n\nNow I spend my mornings reviewing markdown files. Not code — markdown. Design documents, implementation plans, architecture decisions. Then I approve a plan and watch 50 files change in a single feature branch. My job is to read the changeset and figure out if it makes sense.\n\nSometimes I don't trust my own review, so I ask another agent to review it for me.\n\nI'm not even joking. That's my actual workflow now.\n\nThe weird part is I'm shipping more than I ever did. But the skill that matters isn't \"can you write a clean function\" anymore. It's \"can you describe what you want clearly enough that something else builds it right.\" The bottleneck moved from execution to intent.\n\nI've been coding for 22 years and I genuinely think the profession just changed more in the last 12 months than in the previous 20. The developers I know who are thriving right now aren't the ones who write the cleanest code — they're the ones who adapted fastest to directing it instead of typing it.\n\nAnd the ones who are still debating whether AI is \"real programming\"... I don't know, man. The world's not going to wait for that debate to end.",

The developers who struggle most with AI are not the ones with poor prompting skills. They are the ones who never had to think about system design because they were too deep in implementation details for years.\n\n  \nReviewing 50-file changesets is also a different skill than reviewing a PR from a junior. You need to hold a mental model of the entire system and spot where the AI made locally correct but globally wrong decisions. It is closer to being a tech lead than a senior IC.\n\n  \nThe weirdest shift for me has been realizing that writing throwaway code to test an idea is now slower than just describing the idea and seeing what comes back.

I ask it what can be done to improve the code. Is there any duplication that can be refactored (typically - yes). I ask it did it test all use cases and the edges. Give me a tests added description. I ask it for a code coverage report for the changes. I ask it to monitor the CI builds so it can fix whatever breaks or fails without me asking.\n\nI ask it to run the vulnerability scan to make sure none were introduced. I have an MCP installed that allows the model to look up component version information and vulnerability information so it makes better dependency choices (it is really bad at this on its own).\n\nOnce everything is working and provable, I ask it to break the changes down into incremental PRs that build on top of each other with incremental demos and tests that prove each PR. The output of the final PR in the chain must match the demo output of the full code original PR. Now the work is in consumable chunks so the team can review it.

I'm building a macOS app as a solo dev and my workflow has completely shifted in the last 6 months.\n\nThe thing nobody talks about is how this changes what \"being productive\" feels like. Before, productivity was measured in lines written or features shipped. Now it's measured in how well you can describe what you want and how quickly you catch when the agent goes off the rails. It's a completely different skill and honestly some days it feels less satisfying — like you're managing instead of creating.\n\nThe 50-file changeset thing is both the superpower and the trap. Yes, an agent can refactor your entire codebase in one shot. But can you actually review 50 files and catch the subtle bug it introduced in file #37? Realistically, no. I've learned to break things into smaller chunks not because the agent can't handle big tasks, but because I can't properly review big outputs.\n\nWhat I've settled on:\n- \\*\\*Architecture decisions are still 100% human.\\*\\* The agent is terrible at knowing when NOT to build something.\n- \\*\\*Implementation is mostly agent-driven\\*\\*, but with very specific constraints in the prompt. \"Use this pattern, touch only these files, don't refactor anything else.\"\n- \\*\\*Testing is where agents actually shine the most.\\*\\* Writing tests is tedious, agents love tedious, and the output is easily verifiable.\n\nThe \"intent bottleneck\" someone mentioned above is spot on. The developers who thrive with AI tools are the ones who already had strong opinions about system design. If you never developed that muscle, delegating to an agent just means you ship bad architecture faster.",
