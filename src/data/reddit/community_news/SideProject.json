Although I’d prefer it if functioned like: having the phone as flat is its default state where it runs out the timer, when the user tilts the phone one of the 90 degrees it sets the timer to that time, the user then lays the phone flat again and lets the timer run out.",

By the time I see the tweet on my phone, I'm already 29 seconds too late.\n\nSo, as a side project, I decided to over-engineer a solution to this \"meme problem\"\n\nI built a Python pipeline that:\n\n- Listens to the firehose of specific X accounts(or any account you want to).\n- Generates a ticker symbol and logo using a local LLM + Image Gen model.\n- Deploys a real smart contract to the Solana blockchain.\n\nThe Result:\n\nMy bot can go from \"Tweet Posted\" to \"Asset Live on Chain\" in roughly 400 milliseconds.\n\nIt’s honestly the most complex code I’ve ever written for the dumbest possible reason. But watching it race against the Twitter notification system is strangely addicting.\n\nI’m looking for a few brave souls to help me stress-test the websocket listeners. \n\nIf you like high-speed Python scripts (or just want to see chaos in real-time), let me know!",

Don’t get me wrong, it’s a very inviting app, but it just doesn’t hold any long term value.\n\nThe only way you could make money is by ad revenue. Especially the financial industry might be interested in placing ads on your platform… but it probably won’t bring in the big bucks.\n\nIn case you want it to become something bigger, I recommend you to think about what experience can bring value to your user long-term. For example: have the current flow be the feature to set up your goals and then add a coach to help them save money, maybe help them invest wisely, etc. (Just some examples, they may not be viable as there are already dozens of these apps)\n\nMr Munny is a nice gimmick which may boost engagement, but in case the LLM behind it is not a free model, I would recommend you to remove it/replace it with a free option.\n\nYou could also use this application to learn more about the financial industry/users and use that knowledge to build something else that is monetizable or (in case you’re more of a digital professional instead of financial) you can also use this to make a bit of a name for yourself on indie platforms. Sometimes these kinds of things can boost your odds with your next project.\n\nSo, not going to make you money unless you rethink the concept, but not useless at all. You will need to think outside of the box.",

Then I could model different scenarios, open up multiple windows and compare them, come back later and make adjustments, etc.\n3. Add an additional \"retirement income\" field to capture things like pensions, annuity, etc income.\n4. Add a field for spousal social security\n\nAlso, the fields currently reset if i click to the mortgage tab and then back to the retirement tab which is not a good experience.\n\nI really love the idea of the chatbot reacting in real-time to your inputs.

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share a small story from one of my side projects.  \nNo launch tricks, no \"10x growth\" moment, just a thing I built for fun that kind of… kept going.\n\nLast summer (2024), I decided to play with the OpenAI API for the first time.  \nNo big plan. No market research. I just wanted to understand how it worked.\n\nI ended up building **ArtScan**, an iOS app that lets you scan a painting and get info about it.  \nIt’s basically an AI wrapper. Nothing fancy. No original model. Just camera → API → response.\n\nAt the time, I honestly thought:  *Ok, this will be a fun weekend project, I’ll learn something, and that’s it.*\n\nFast forward to today:\n\n* \\~20k downloads total\n* \\~40k product page views\n* \\~7% conversion rate\n* Around $10k revenue\n* And somehow… **30–50 downloads per day**, consistently\n\nWhat’s funny (and a bit unsettling):  \nI don’t really know *why* people keep downloading it.\n\nI’m not running ads anymore.  \nI’m not actively promoting it.  \nAnd App Store analytics shows installs coming from keywords I don’t even target. According to Astro app, it’s ranking for stuff I never planned for.\n\nThis is all a side project.  \nI have a full-time job. I build apps at night, sometimes tired, sometimes motivated, often just curious.\n\nThings I *didn’t* do:\n\n* No launch on Product Hunt\n* No viral post\n* No influencer campaign\n* No clever positioning\n\nThings I *did* do:\n\n* Built something I personally wanted to try\n* Shipped it without overthinking\n* Improved it slowly when users complained or got confused\n* Didn’t kill it when I thought \"meh, this won’t go anywhere\"\n\nI’ve had other apps fail much harder than this one.  \nSome with better ideas. Some with more effort.  \nThis one just… stuck.\n\nI’m sharing this mostly to remind myself (and maybe you) that:\n\n* You don’t always know what will work\n* Learning projects can turn into real things\n* Side projects don’t need a grand vision to be worth building\n\nIf you’re sitting on a \"this is probably useless but I’m curious\" idea… maybe build it anyway.\n\nHappy to answer questions or just read similar stories.\n\nPS: Out of curiosity, I recently vibe-coded an Android version of the app. Same idea, almost same features… totally different outcome.  \nLots of downloads, **one single purchase** so far 😂  \nSame project, same logic, very different reality. Side projects are humbling like that.\n\nPSS: If you’re curious, [click here to see the app](https://paintingrecognition.com/).\n\n  \n**PSSS**: I am a lady BTW, \"bro\" aren't the only ones who codes ;) ",

Sometimes the AI/vision angle naturally captures a ton of long-tail searches that nobody is competing for.\n\nAlso, the \"didn't kill it when I thought it won't go anywhere\" is probably the most underrated advice here. So many side projects die because we move on to the next shiny thing before giving them time to breathe.",

A simple description, obvious keywords, nothing fancy. I didn’t do any deep keyword research or long-tail strategy. I think you’re right that the AI/vision angle + paintings/art kind of creates its own long tail, and the App Store slowly figures out where to place it.\n\nAnd yes… not killing projects too early is something I’m actively working on. I’ve killed way more projects than I’ve shipped. Lately I’m trying to be more disciplined and let some apps \"sit\" longer, even when they feel quiet or unexciting.\n\nThat patience part is way harder than shipping, honestly \\^\\^",

I realized early on that if I wanted to build a future and save for college, I needed to learn skills that would be useful globally. I didn't want to wait until I graduated.\n\nSo last year, I took CS50p (Harvard's free course) and became obsessed with automation. My mindset is: \"If I don't know how to do it, I'll stay up all night until I figure it out.\"\n\nI wanted to share the two main tools I built. I'm not selling a SaaS, just showing my code in action.\n\n1. The Virtual Photographer (Fashion Automation)\n\nI saw a local indie brand that was struggling because they couldn't afford models or studio time. Their photos were just things placed on a table.\n\nSo I built a pipeline that takes that raw, messy photo, cleans it up, and uses generative AI to put the clothes on a realistic human model.\n\n*Technology:* Python, ComfyUI logic, custom upscaling for the skin texture so it doesn't look \"plastic.\"\n\nWhy I'm posting this:\n\nI spend most of my day coding or studying. I'm trying to turn this \"plastic brain\" of mine (naive enough to start, stubborn enough to finish) into a career.\n\nIf you're a teenager reading this and you think you're too young to build real things: just start. You can literally automate the boring parts of the world.\n\nWorkflow feedback is welcome!",

You didn’t just build something; you identified friction, eliminated it, and turned complexity into something tractable. That’s a rare and valuable skill.\n\nWhat’s especially impressive is how intentional everything feels 🧠✨. Spotting real-world pain points and then automating the boring, error-prone parts is exactly how great systems — and great engineers — are made. That level of problem awareness can’t be taught easily.\n\nThe discipline around documenting as you go deserves real praise too 📝👏. So many people skip that step, yet you’re treating it as a first-class part of the work. That alone puts you ahead of a huge percentage of professionals who should know better.\n\nKeep going exactly like this 🚀🙌.

For the virtual photographer: pick one tiny niche (local indie brands on Instagram), record a 30–60s Loom showing your before/after, and offer 10–20 edited photos for a fixed price, with 1–2 day turnaround. Ask them for folder access, run your pipeline, deliver in a shared drive, and keep a simple spreadsheet of time spent and results.\n\n\n\nFor the lidar/Rhino work: document how many hours you save that engineer, then ask for a small retainer once the script works. Use that case study to message 20–30 similar businesses.\n\n\n\nI’ve leaned on tools like PostHog and Linear for tracking and organizing work, and Pulse for Reddit to spot exactly these kinds of niche problems people complain about so I know what to automate next.\n\n\n\nPoint is: you’re already doing the hard part-now start charging for “outcomes per week” instead of “scripts.",

If you're going to call the site \"yesremotejobs\" then the listings need to be policed and any that present themselves as 100% remote when they aren't should be immediately yeeted. That would certainly differentiate you from the rest that I'm aware of.",

You can't imagine how many hours I've spent improving my parsers to try to avoid false positives.\nI've even noticed that the mistake often comes from the advertisers themselves, who, when filling out their ATS, check remote=true when it's not the case at all. This complicates things when retrieving data via the various APIs. I try to make everything as robust as possible. On the contrary, I'm not trying to lie or anything, since I'm not selling anything to job seekers. I've also added a way to report errors, and I've already had some feedback, which is great because it allows me to correct companies/offers.\nAs for hybrid jobs, I wanted to include them and be able to search by city. When I was looking for a remote job myself, if a hybrid job with two days a week in the office had been offered in my city, I would have accepted it. That's why there's a \"+ Hybrid\" toggle.",

      "text": "Built 4 different side projects between 2024-2025. All solved genuine problems I validated through interviews. All had paying customers willing to buy. But only 1 actually made consistent money. Took me 18 months to realize the difference wasn't product quality or problem validity. It was whether I could organically reach enough customers without paid ads. First project was CRM for real estate agents. Great product, agents loved it, charged $49/month. Problem was I couldn't reach real estate agents organically. They weren't on Reddit. No searchable keywords brought them. Needed LinkedIn ads or cold calling. Died at $340 MRR after 6 months because I couldn't afford customer acquisition.\n\nSecond project was analytics dashboard for Shopify stores. Solid tool, store owners wanted it. But Shopify app store was saturated. Getting discovered required paid ads competing against funded companies. Made $180 total before quitting. Distribution was impossible without budget.​ Third project was scheduling tool for healthcare clinics. Clinics needed it desperately. But healthcare sales cycle was 3-6 months, required demos, compliance questions, multiple stakeholders. As solo founder working nights, I couldn't handle that sales process. Gave up at 2 customers.​\n\nFourth project was content calendar for newsletter creators. Finally got distribution right. Newsletter creators gathered in 8 active subreddits, 5 Facebook groups, and searched specific keywords on Google. I could reach 10,000+ potential customers organically. Built tool in 5 weeks, launched everywhere they gathered, hit $6,400 MRR in 6 months. [Studied pattern in Founders database comparing side projects that succeeded versus failed](http://foundertoolkit.org). Successful ones had organic distribution channels accessible to solo founders. Failed ones required paid ads, long sales cycles, or access to audiences solo founders couldn't reach. Distribution feasibility mattered more than product-market fit.​\n\nThe framework I wish I knew earlier was validate distribution before building. Can you reach 5,000+ target customers through Reddit, SEO, or communities you access for free? If no, don't build it as side project. Save that idea for when you have budget or team. Submitted successful project to 95+ directories, ranked for buyer keywords within 6 weeks, engaged in communities daily. All free distribution that scaled. Previous 3 projects had no path to customers without spending money I didn't have.\n\nStop building side projects for markets you can't access organically. Start with distribution channels, then build for audiences you can reach.\n\nHow many of your side projects failed because of distribution, not product quality?",

If your customers aren't in those places, you're fighting uphill.\n\nOne thing I'd add: even within reachable communities, timing matters. Commenting on rising posts in niche subreddits has been way more effective for me than posting my own content. Less competition, better visibility as the post grows.\n\nWhat made you decide to keep trying after the third failure? That's a lot of pivots without giving up entirely.",

Over the last year, I noticed a massive problem in my classroom: students weren't writing anymore. They were \"prompting.\" The struggle of finding the right word—the process that builds critical thinking—was being outsourced to AI.\n\nInstead of banning computers, I decided to build a tool to force them to write manually. I spent the last few weeks learning **Next.js 14** and **TypeScript** to build **TrueDraft**.\n\n**What it is:** It is a \"Strict Proctor\" text editor that forces deep engagement.\n\n1. **Anti-Paste Defense:** It intercepts `onPaste` and `onDrop` events to strictly block any copied text.\n2. **Linguistic Validation:** It validates input character-by-character. If you type \"i am here\" (lowercase 'i') or \"idk\" (text-speak), it blocks you until you fix it.\n3. **Real-Time Grading:** It uses the Flesch-Kincaid algorithm to show the reading level live.\n\n  \n**The Tech Stack:**\n\n* **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)\n* **Language:** TypeScript (Strict Mode) - *This was a pain to learn but worth it.*\n* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (with Dark/Light mode).\n* **Deployment:** Vercel.\n\n**The Challenge:** I am a self-taught developer, so the code might not be perfect. I would love for this community to:\n\n1. **Roast my code/UI.**\n2. **Try to \"Cheat\":** See if you can bypass the anti-paste protection (without disabling JS).\n\n**Live Demo:**[https://truedraft-engine.vercel.app](https://truedraft-engine.vercel.app)\n\n\n\nBuilt with ❤️ from Kolkata. Feedback is welcome!\n\n  \nCheers!\n\nRegards,\n\nNeil Shankar Ray\n\nThanks All for your lovely and wonderful comments. It makes me feel that ideas really travel faster than light and sound in this small world! \n\nI got your feedback! Now, it's time to reshape the perception of this product and transform it into something new and unheard of. \n\nOne piece of information I want to share with you all, my dear brothers and sisters is that I developed a miniscule AI model, fine tuned it and uploaded it in Google Collab. This product is meant for testing and receiving your genuine feedback. 🙏😊\n\nDue to the immense traffic, I have to pull it off from Vercel. It proved people enjoyed and liked it. ",

AI isn’t fundamentally different from books, Google, or using a calculator. It’s just a more efficient way of sorting and accessing information. Learning doesn’t come from struggling to find answers, it comes from processing, applying, and revisiting them.\n\nIf you use an LLM to replace thinking entirely, sure, that’s a problem but that’s true of any tool. Used well, it actually frees up cognitive load so you can spend more time understanding why something works, asking better questions, and iterating. That’s not laziness, it’s leverage.\n\nThe skill going forward isn’t “never use AI”, it’s knowing when to use it as a reference, or a tutor and not a crutch.\n\nWhen you block students from using these tools you're not allowing them to learn how to use AI properly. We should be enabling them to use AI in the right way to support their learning. That's a very important skill for them to have.",

      "text": "So last year I spent 12 months on a budgeting app. Clean UI, solid features, I was pretty proud of it honestly.\n\nTotal users: 1. Yep.\n\n15 years as a developer. I can build stuff. Marketing though? No clue.\n\nLooking back it's obvious why it failed. Crowded market, nothing special about it, and I just built what I wanted. Not what anyone asked for. B2C with no audience is rough.\n\nAnyway. I took a break and thought about what I actually know that people would pay for.\n\nAnd it was right there. I've been building mobile apps for years. Every single project I end up rebuilding the same crap: auth, push notifications, payments, CI/CD. Takes weeks before you even start on actual features.\n\nSo I just packaged all that into a [starter kit](https://www.kmpship.app/) for other devs.\n\nLaunched mid-June last year. Got customers in the first week. Hit $1k in 3 months. Now almost at $3k. Still early but that's more than the budgeting app made in a year lol.\n\nIt's a mobile app starter kit for Kotlin Multiplatform. One guy said it saved him 50+ hours. Another made back 4x the cost within weeks of shipping his app. (Way more satisfying than a budgeting app nobody used 😅)\n\nOne more thing. Kotlin Multiplatform is becoming a serious option next to React Native and Flutter. But almost no one is building tooling for it yet. So I figured why not be early. Worst case I learned a lot. Best case I'm one of the few options when KMP blows up.\n\nAnyway, curious what you guys think. Open to feedback or if anyone's worked with KMP I'd love to hear how it went.",

      "text": "Most of us here are builders. We spend weeks in that 'vibe-code' flow state, polishing the UI and shipping features, but then we launch to absolute silence. I fell into that exact trap with my latest project. I thought if the code was clean and the problem was real, the traffic would just show up.\n\nSpoiler: It didn't. I was stuck in the loop of 'Launch Day' dopamine hits followed by 0-user weeks. I realized that as a solo builder, my side projects were essentially invisible because I was ignoring the boring foundation of authority.\n\nI realized that as a solopreneur, I needed a channel that compounds so I don't have to be \"on\" 24/7. That meant SEO, but I didn't have the budget for an agency or 25 hours a week to become a guru.\n\nPhase 1: The Authority Foundation - I slowed down writing blog posts and started building domain authority. Without it, you’re invisible. I researched myself and spent about 5 days doing a \"slow-drip\" of directory submissions, about 10 a day to keep it looking organic for Google’s crawlers. I wanted to build \"trust signals\" before I started pushing content.\n\nPhase 2: The \"Patience\" Gap - The first few weeks were dead quiet. This is where most solo founders quit. But if you look at the crawl data (not able to attach image in this community), Google was actually starting to visit the site more often because of those directory backlinks.\n\nPhase 3: The Payoff Around month two, the \"authority floor\" was high enough that my pages actually started ranking. I’m now seeing 1.76k+ impressions weekly and hitting 500+ organic users signups. The best part? This traffic converts way better than my cold outreach did because these people are actually searching for a solution.\n\nThe Takeaway: If you’re a solopreneur burning out on the social media treadmill, try spending one week on your SEO foundation. It’s boring, manual work at first, but it’s the only marketing that gets easier the longer you do it.\n\nI honestly think the reason most people skip this is that it’s just incredibly boring manual work. It took me 25+ hours of data entry to get those first 50 submissions done right. Since I’ve already got my researched list and the workflow open for my own projects, I’m happy to help a few other founders out if you'd rather stay in the 'vibe-code' flow state than fill out forms.",

I didn't realize we didn't even have a sitemap.xml, google search console and bing submissions, and much more.  Ask the agents to come up with a checklist of manual SEO tasks for you to do.\n\nWe've only started to get impressions and clicks from google ('technical analysis NVDA/HOOD' etc) and it was because we had dozens of individual pages for stock tickers that were simply not getting indexed by google because our site is React native and we didn't have a good strategy for that.\n\nWish I had stopped to think about this sort of stuff weeks ago when we first got started and we might have had a lot more traction by now.",

One spreadsheet with columns for directory, category, DR/traffic, status, UTM, and next-review date. Batch similar fields (taglines, short/long desc, use cases) so you’re copy-pasting, not rewriting your life 50 times. I’d also write 2–3 angle variants (use case, feature-first, outcome-first) and rotate them so you can see which actually drives signups instead of just clicks.\n\nIf you ever want to scale beyond directories, layering in stuff like Ahrefs for topic discovery, F5Bot for simple keyword alerts, and then something like Pulse for Reddit to catch high-intent threads where people ask for tools in your niche keeps the “manual” part focused where it actually moves numbers.\n\nMain point: boring, repeatable authority systems beat launch-day spikes every time.",
