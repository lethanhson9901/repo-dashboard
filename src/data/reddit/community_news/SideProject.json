Honestly I've downloaded and tried like 12 gym/ fitness tracking apps (essentially to research the competition/ copy useful features) and none of them seem to address the pain points they should. \n\nBeen lifting and meal prepping for more than a decade and there are certain features that I would personally pay money for but haven't seen implemented.\n\nAlso imo MyFitnessPal falls short in a few areas that I have already fleshed out in my app. I have more advanced searching/ sorting/ filtering than they do, more advanced/ comprehensive user recipes, and shareable, rateable recipes/ meals (content discovery). That and user generated meal plans of arbitrary day length, which can be auto-logged from the nutrition diary page, reducing tracking friction, and used to instantly generate a grocery list (and are also shareable and ratable). \n\nFrankly it's just a better app, even now, which I will be offering at a lower price point. The real issue I see with a lot of these gym apps (and again I've looked at a lot of them) is that they're honestly not very good. They're poorly coded and not very feature rich, like people threw it together in < 1 month with little thought as to what differentiates them from the competition and they think they're gonna be millionaires overnight. This project has taken me a few months now already (in my spare time, I am already employed) and I'm not close to being done.",

      "text": "I went through nearly 4,000 apps across 25 App Store categories and hundreds of thousands of reviews looking for a pattern. I found one: the App Store is full of apps where the developer quit but the users didn't. People are still downloading and paying because there's literally nothing else. Every one of these can be built in a weekend with Cursor, Replit, Claude Code, or whatever floats your boat.\n\n1. Discogs (Music) The bible for vinyl collectors. 67K ratings. They pushed a redesign that nuked the app. 43% of recent reviews are 1-star. Login breaks, collections won't load. Discogs has had a public API for over a decade (Some of us were mere toddlers back then), and it's stable. This is the Apollo-for-Reddit opportunity of 2026. Build a beautiful third-party Discogs client, charge $5-10, and you'll have a line of vinyl nerds throwing money at you.\n2. RoadReady (Education) Every state requires teens to log supervised driving hours before they can get a license. DMVs recommend apps for this. RoadReady hasn't been updated in 2 years and randomly deletes driving logs. The bar is basically \"don't delete my data.\" Core Data, a timer, a PDF export. Charge $5-10. New customers show up every year when kids turn 15 (Happy birthday!—here's a shitty app).\n3. ABA Wizard (Education) A $10 study app for the RBT certification exam. RBT stands for \"Registered Behavior Technician.\" It ships wrong answers. So people study for weeks, feel ready, then fail the real exam. Store says 4.6 stars. Recent reviews average 2.62.\n4. InfiniteHoops (Sports) Basketball play diagramming tool that can't erase, can't save. Build drag-and-drop play diagrams with frame-by-frame animation. Coaches text plays to players before games. $5-10.\n5. File Converter apps (Utilities) The entire category is a scam. Dozens of apps charging $10-20/WEEK(!) through subscriptions. Meanwhile, Apple's native frameworks handle 90% of conversions on-device. Build an honest one, charge $2.99 once, market it as \"the one that isn't a scam.\" Zero server costs.\n6. Goblin Tools (Utilities) Proved ADHD users will pay for AI assistance. Crashes 85% of the time on its core feature, AND it never helps you actually do the tasks. The execution layer (nudges, progress tracking, Reminders integration), and just actually working, is where the value is.\n7. Spirit Talker (Lifestyle) $5 paranormal entertainment app just bricked itself. Developer? Gone. Its entire distribution channel is paranormal YouTubers (50K-500K subs) actively looking for recommendations. Accelerometer + audio + atmosphere. You don't even need to figure out marketing.\n8. ScoreCloud Express (Music) Hum a melody, get sheet music. 2.0 stars. Their algorithms are from 2013. What's changed: Spotify's Basic Pitch model now runs on-device. You can build something a lot better using tools that didn't exist in 2013.\n9. Quick Checkbook Pro (Finance) A whole category of checkbook apps whose developers vanished. Users are 50+ and trapped with financial records in dead apps. Build a checkbook register that never loses data, imports CSV from the dead competitors, charge $4.99. Small market but zero competition and loyal users.\n10. Juno Connect (Dev Tools) Jupyter notebooks on iPad can't connect to modern Jupyter anymore. Developer MIA. Still $5, people still buy it not knowing it's dead. Build a JupyterLab 4 client, charge $7.99.\n\nSo the pattern is: someone built an app, it found users, the developer moved on. You don't need to innovate or find product-market fit. The market exists (and it fits like a glove). Show up, build something that works, and don't abandon it—or at least sell it to someone else that will maintain it instead of leaving your poor users to fend for themselves.\n\nOh, and three pricing things from the data: users happily pay one-time for focused tools — $5-10 sweet spot. Store ratings are lying to you (ABA Wizard shows 4.6, recent average is 2.62... always read the last 50 reviews). And \"works on current iOS\" is literally a competitive advantage. Half these apps die one update at a time.\n\nI've got data on all 25 categories if anyone wants to see a specific one. Curious to see if anyone plans to build one of these.",

You see the same thing outside the App Store too, especially with browser extensions. So many Chrome extensions get abandoned or bloated, but users stick around because there's just no better option and swapping tools is a pain.\n\n\n\nSome proven strategies: focus on a super tight use case and don't try to do everything. Ship small, meaningful updates so users know it isn't dead. Be public about your roadmap and actually let users have input, literal feature voting works wonders. Keep direct lines to your users open, not just a support form black hole. Transparency and quick fixes build long-term trust.\n\n\n\nYou can use tools like Zovo to see this approach in the wild, it's a suite of Chrome extensions where users vote on what gets built and request features directly to the dev. That model really helps avoid the slow death by abandonment most indie tools face. Basically, just showing up and listening goes further than any fancy tech.",

I do.\n\nOr - or - to set dec a sweltering set for 14 hours straight just so you can get 2 minutes of footage?\n\nDo you know what sucks even more? 10,000 students attend film school annually. Most of them don't have a snowball's chance in hell at making their dream movie. Hollywood was a nepotism pyramid with few positions of autonomy. Now every storyteller has a chance.\n\nIf you think making videos with AI is easy, you haven't tried to use the tools. It takes real work. And you have to know what you're doing.\n\nEveryone now has a camera in their pockets thanks to smartphones, but how many people would you trust to take your wedding photos? How many are going to take Pulitzer winning photos? Not many, right? Yet the fear some decades ago was that this would replace photographers.\n\nThis empowers people. As I said, I've been a filmmaker for 15 years. I know lots of people in the industry. Mostly making under six figures a year. My friends wanted to make sci-fi epics and fantasy movies. But they wound up doing stuff like BTS featurettes for Marvel and boring sports star interviews. This gives them the spark back. They don't need Disney capital (or Disney telling them what to do).\n\nThink of all the thousands of Scorseses whose dreams withered away and died on the vine. Now every kid has a shot of building themselves into a phenomenal storyteller.\n\nChin up. This is a good thing.\n\nI fucking love film. I fucking love it. I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't think it was a net positive to storytelling. I am building this for me and my friends to use. And now I'm sharing it with anyone who wants to join our storytelling journey.\n\nIt isn't easy, even with these tools.",

It's in the roadmap to do local-only, no-accounts, and also talk to Comfy and local models.\n\nThis is a large pivot from a crazy complicated AI animation tool that I was working on that was too early for its time (though it might make a comeback this year) : [storyteller.ai](http://storyteller.ai)\n\nI built that before image-to-video models were popular and it was directing AnimateDiff and ControlNets. It was really advanced for its time, but felt too much work for the results.\n\nI think we'll have something in the near future where you'll be able to grab keyframes directly out of videos and re-articulate/re-direct them.\n\nI plan on spinning up a separate open source \"GenHub\" to collect your outputs (optionally) if you want across several services, and even share them with your collaborators for bigger projects.\n\nI have a lot of other ideas: OpenFal/OpenOpenRouter, OpenRunPod, ...\n\nI'm trying to fix up the internal app routing components and then add as many services to it as I can as quickly as I can. I'm also fixing the Seedream gens because ByteDance is falling over with traffic.\n\nI promise I'll get to it!\n\nedit: grammar, clarity",

      "text": "I spent 6 months building something for my side hustle that I knew would make zero dollars. Here's why it was the best decision I've made.\n\nAbout a year ago, my partner Maddy and I started a baking site that helps people swap out baking ingredients, especially for gluten-free bakers.\n\nWe started like most people do. Build a page. Run ads. Try to make the numbers work.\n\nIt was working. But I kept thinking... what if ad costs jump? What if Meta changes something overnight? What if our account gets shut down? One traffic source. One thing that could break.\n\nSo I made a bet. One that I knew would make ZERO dollars for at least 6 months.\n\nInstead of writing blog posts one at a time, I built 300+ pages using code. Every baking ingredient gets its own page. Every ingredient swap gets its own page.\n\nIf someone Googles \"can I use cottage cheese instead of sour cream in baking,\" I want a page answering that exact question. A full page with the ratio, the tips, and the context.\n\nI built the whole thing with AI tools while working my full-time job.\n\nThen... nothing happened.\n\nFor 5 months, I'd check Google Search Console and see a few clicks. Maybe 1,000 people saw us on a good day. 300+ pages on the internet that nobody was finding. And I was still spending on ads every day to keep things going.\n\nMost people skip SEO because it's just so slow. With ads, you spend $50 a day and know by next week if it worked. With SEO, you build for months and hear nothing back.\n\nMonth 7, it hit. And it hit HARD.\n\nGoogle finally understood what the site was about. Dozens of pages started ranking at the same time. We went from 1-2K views per day to 4-5K. Last week we hit 7,000+ in a single day.\n\nThat's when I started layering in blog posts built to earn Amazon affiliate income.\n\n\"Best gluten-free bread at Costco.\"  \n\"Best almond flour brands.\"\n\nEvery visitor already wants to buy something. Every product link earns a commission. The traffic is free.\n\nThe blog posts link back to the 300+ pages (helping them rank higher), and those pages push readers toward the money content. The whole site feeds itself.\n\nThen I found pages with 8,000-9,000 views in Google but almost zero clicks. The titles weren't good enough.\n\nRewrote them to match what people were actually searching. Clicks tripled in two weeks.\n\nThe cool part is that all this free traffic fills our retargeting pool for Meta ads.\n\nMore visitors → bigger audience → better ROAS. The SEO work made our ads better too.\n\nWhere we are now: 700K search views. 2,700 clicks. 20 toolkit sales. 1,600 newsletter signups. $38,000 in revenue. Growing every week.\n\nNo link building. No SEO agency. No expensive tools.\n\nIf you're struggling to get people to find out about your side project, there's only content and referrals. Blogs are cheap to run, consider it.

I spend $120/day promoting my main resource, and make $200-300 a day promoting it, along with all of the one time offers that I offer after purchase.\n\nOrganic is growing along side it, I recently got approved for an ad network called mediavine journey and was told I'd be able to earn a $20 RPM. At my site numbers that would equate to $300 or so a month at the scale I'm at now.\n\nI recently got approved with the Amazon API a week ago. I added affililiate to all of my relevant pages, and so far we've made $20 from it, so on track to about $80/month right now. Focusing now on more expensive baking items for the potential for a higher payout.\n\nFor example amazon gives you a 1% commission on food products, so thats like .08 cents on a 8 dollar bag of flour, versus a 4% commission on baking equipment, so like $28 on a high end kitchenaid mixer. Those new posts haven't ranked yet so i expect amazon to increase significantly the way my graph has panned out.",

The “overkill” thing is gold, and I feel like everyone ignores it because it sounds so negative when it’s actually pointing straight to a market gap. Your point about post-funding complaint spikes is spot on too.\n\n\n\nOne thing I’d add: sometimes the pain point isn’t just feature bloat or missing features, but the total lack of transparency and user input. People get burned by tools that never update or add random changes nobody wants, and there’s rarely a way to talk directly to the devs. If you can build in a way for users to vote on features or message the developer, it’s a massive trust builder. That kind of approach has solved a lot of headaches in my own projects, happy to share more if you’re interested.",

Started digging through Reddit threads and forum discussions trying to spot actual problems people keep repeating, and ended up building an algorithm to do it systematically.\nYour post about the patterns (especially the \"been doing this manually for X years\" one) is basically what I'm trying to detect. So many people describe real problems but word them in ways that sound boring, which is exactly why they're not getting built for.\nI just launched a POC that does this automatically - fetches discussions, pulls out the pain signals, clusters them into ideas, and shows you the evidence instead of just a score. It's rough and definitely beta, but it's doing the pattern matching you're describing.\nThought it might actually be useful for what you're working on. Would love genuine feedback if you check it out - what works, what doesn't, what's missing. That stuff helps way more than upvotes.\nhttps://zerochapter.com/",

                  "text": "ahh, you might be onto something about automated PRs being submitted to a popular repo having triggered an automated ban. I make heavy use of Claude Code, Codex and Gemini sometimes concurrently on the same repo: but only repos that I own. There may be a significant risk to using these tools on public 3rd party repos (eg ones you don't own). \n\nI think generally when it comes to submitting PRs to others' repos its good form to do it manually. IMO, generative tools lack the context and tact to submit a PR in a truly collaborative way.\n\nTo me, it makes sense that GitHub is taking some sort of defensive action against LLM use: a huge part of the appeal of GitHub is its social nature. Previously when we browsed repos and saw issues or PRs come up, we knew it was a person who had submitted it and there is a nature of engagement to that. With a significant portion of activity on GitHub now driven by people with LLMs or even fully automated LLMs with no governance, there is potential for degradation of quality and relevance to the people that formerly flocked to GitHub. To me, this puts the platform at real risk of becoming obsolete. This article seems to agree: https://medium.com/@noah_25268/github-is-dying-and-developers-dont-even-know-it-yet-cca14b732ae5",

When foreign countries do it to us - like the Chinese selling steel in America to wipe out the industry - it’s called “dumping”. Either way, it’s an attempt to create an illegal monopoly. Oddly, Trump hates dumping, but has no appetite for enforcing antitrust laws. \n\nI live in two communities that have a high emphasis on preserving the community look, feel, and past. In both the city had never approved a big box store, or even fast food anywhere near the downtown. \n\nAbsent a change of heart in the government ,this will happen. In fact, while I don’t follow it carefully, I’ll bet anything we are already at a stage where “baby smothering” is happening.

The part that really helped was actually planning the steps and using the plan mode to be able to actually know what I'm going to build for each step, and also creating a modular file system and relying on the components on prebuilt design systems, like using Material 3 for the UI stuff, and have more focus on the actual functionality and the backend of it.\n\nI built everything on a feature-first architecture, and inside of each feature, I had separate files for the navbar, for each section. So whenever whenever I was working with the agents, I actually prompted multiple agents, often six at a time, to build each part of that feature or that page. So because of the modularity of the files, I could be able to shoot like five to six agents at a time, and they wouldn't clash with each other because they are working on separate files.\n\nAnd that was pretty much my whole workflow. For prompting tips, think about whenever you are sending your prompt, if you send that prompt again, you should be getting the same result back and not get like another variable outcome.\n\nAs an example, when you want to design a button, if you are specific about it and say fully rounded corners with 20 pixel top bottom left and right padding and this exact font token size, whenever you run that prompt, it results into that specific outcome that you want.\n\nBut if you say I want a beautiful button, every time that you run that prompt, it will be giving you a variable outcome and becomes kind of like \"vibe coding\".\n\nThat's the difference between vibe coding and agentic engineering, where in vibe coding, you actually like you're vibing through the building part, but in agentic, you are specific about the things that you want to do.\n\nI just wrote this with [www.openyapper.com](http://www.openyapper.com)",

So, you can get it from your own Google AI Studio workspace and use it for free. And it's safe, and you can also try configuring it on your own with a local LLM. If you want to develop it as a feature, you can send a PR to me, and I will be merging it so anyone who has implementation for their local LLM can properly adjust. But I imagine the local LLM must be having the capability of multimodality for being able to transcribe voice. And it might be a slower and more cost than the Gemini.

              "text": "Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. The reason I chose Flutter was that because Flutter is a high-level language, it has shorter syntaxes, so with less output tokens, I can write more code, and with less input tokens, the AI agent can have more context about the app. So, the whole work process is more efficient. This is the reason one, and the reason number two is that because it is supported by Google, there is only one source of truth for all the packages, all the documentation, all the coding best practices, and when you are writing Dart code in Flutter, you can actually get output for Windows, for macOS, for iOS, for Android, for web, and it supports all the platforms, and that's the best thing about it, if you get to start doing Flutter, you use less tokens. You only have one SOT for all of your packages and all of your coding styles that the AI agent get reference to. You have powerful design systems to access from Material 3 design system to all the other open source like Cupertino and all the other design systems, and overall, it's just so much smoother workflow.

AI agents are like a junior dev, but they are really smart, so you can rely on them for very small and specific tasks. One thing that really helped me for my prompting style is that I don't have any structure for my prompts that I follow, but I exactly talk to AI in a language that is like English, and I like I'm talking to a fellow developer or a colleague rather than trying to overthink my prompts. And I find this to be very faster, and I also always use speech to text for writing my prompts. That's why I can actually build very well, talk through prompts, and be able to have like a lot of details in my prompts. Yapped this by [www.openYapper.com](http://www.openYapper.com) ",

      "text": "Hey SidePorject,\n\nSo I have this small iOS app called **Ban It**. It’s a pretty simple side project of mine. You track bad habits like caffeine, gambling, smoking, etc. The main idea is that it tracks both progress and slip-ups instead of just streaks. I built it mostly for myself because I hated that “reset to zero” feeling.\n\nA few days ago, one of my first paying users messaged me about a small bug. We fixed it quickly. After that, just out of curiosity, I asked him:\n\n“By the way, what habit are you using the app for?”\n\nI was expecting something like coffee. Or maybe nicotine.\n\nHis reply honestly surprised me.\n\nHe said:\n\n“Oh, I’m not using it to quit anything. I use it to track my emotional reactions.”\n\nI had no idea what he meant, so I asked him to explain.\n\nHe told me he runs a small business, and he uses **Ban It,** to log every time he feels the urge to react impulsively. Sending a message too fast. Agreeing to something under pressure. Getting frustrated in negotiations.\n\nIf he pauses and responds calmly, he logs it as a win.  \nIf he reacts emotionally, he logs it as a slip.\n\nOver time, he started seeing patterns. He realized he reacts more when he’s tired. Or when revenue is down. Or when a specific type of client emails him.\n\nI built a habit app to quit caffeine.\n\nThis guy turned it into a self-awareness tool for decision-making.\n\nI honestly never thought about that use case.\n\nIt’s such a weird and humbling feeling when someone uses your product in a way you never designed for.\n\nHas anyone else had a user completely reinterpret their project like this? I’d love to hear your stories.",

      "text": "I built ReqRes in 2014 as a simple fake REST API for testing. You hit /api/users and get predictable JSON back. It was meant for my own test suites.\n\n12 years later, it handles 20 billion requests per month. 56 million unique visitors. It’s embedded in thousands of tutorials, bootcamp curricula, and CI/CD pipelines worldwide. I’ve never spent a dollar on marketing — it all grew organically through developers linking to it in docs and Stack Overflow answers.\n\nThe problem: it makes almost nothing. \\~$200/month MRR from 18 paying users.\n\nLast year I started turning ReqRes into a full backend-as-a-service. Same domain, same reliability, but now you can:\n\n\t∙\tCreate your own collections with custom schemas (not just the fake /api/users)\n\n\t∙\tGet a full CRUD API instantly — no routes to write, no Express, no deploy step\n\n\t∙\tAdd passwordless auth (magic code login) for your app’s users\n\n\t∙\tSet up webhooks that fire on data events\n\n\t∙\tSwitch between dev and prod environments with a single header\n\n\t∙\tGenerate an entire backend from a text description using AI (“a todo app with projects and tags” → live API in 60 seconds)\n\nIt’s basically Supabase + auth + hosting in one, for $12/month. One person runs it. Me.\n\n6,000 people sign up every month. But 98% of them are here for the free fake API — QA engineers running test suites, students following tutorials. They don’t need a backend-as-a-service.\n\nSo I’m building two tracks:\n\n\t1.\tKeep the free API as a distribution moat (it’s how people find me)\n\n\t2.\tBuild a separate path for people who actually need a backend — founders, freelancers, frontend devs hitting the “I need persistence” wall\n\nI just shipped a waitlist demo app (live demo + open source) that’s built entirely on ReqRes with zero backend code. Trying to show people what’s possible beyond the fake API.\n\nNumbers\n\n\t∙\t20.5B requests/month (Cloudflare)\n\n\t∙\t56.5M unique visitors/month\n\n\t∙\t6,082 signups last 30 days\n\n\t∙\t$184 MRR\n\n\t∙\tTeam size: 1\n\n\t∙\tAd spend: $0, ever\n\nWould love feedback on the approach. Has anyone else dealt with massive free distribution that doesn’t convert? How did you create a second product on top of an existing audience?\n\nLinks: reqres.in | waitlist demo: reqres-waitlist-demo.reqres.workers.dev",

It wraps AirLLM in an OpenAI-compatible local server and auto-patches your OpenClaw config to point to it instead of OpenAI/Claude.\n\nOne command and you're done:\n\n`pip install zeroclaw && zeroclaw install`\n\nWhat it does:\n\n* Runs Mistral 7B / Llama 3 8B / Llama 70B locally\n* Works on any 4GB+ GPU (CPU works too, just slower)\n* Auto-detects and patches your OpenClaw config\n* Backs up your original config before touching anything\n* 100% private — nothing leaves your machine\n\nGitHub: [github.com/nickzsche21/ZeroCLAW](http://github.com/nickzsche21/ZeroCLAW)\n\nMIT license, free forever.\n\n*PS: open to feedback, suggestions. If something's broken or you'd do it differently, drop it in the comments.*\n\n\\*\\*\\* Changed the name to AirClaw cuz ZeroClaw was already a different repo.\n\n\\*Note: RabbitLLM support is experimental in v2.0, if you hit issues, run `pip install airclaw[airllm]` for the stable AirLLM backend. Working on verifying RabbitLLM API in v2.1.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*i have created a doc on how to use it and how to trouble shoot error: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y2H11pf48NUfV5iH94SN1OEXa0G-aDOI/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y2H11pf48NUfV5iH94SN1OEXa0G-aDOI/view?usp=sharing)",
