They're everywhere on TikTok and Instagram.\n\nI was manually creating these for a faceless channel and the workflow was painful:  \n\\- Write script  \n\\- Generate voice for character 1  \n\\- Generate voice for character 2  \n\\- Sync the dialogue timing  \n\\- Add captions frame by frame  \n\\- Add sound effects  \n\\- Export and add metadata\n\nTook 2+ hours per video. So I built AutoClips to automate the entire pipeline.\n\n**What's automated now:**\n\n1. **Script generation** \\- Enter topic, AI writes dialogue for both characters\n2. **Multi-voice synthesis** \\- Each character gets their own AI voice, automatically synced\n3. **Caption timing** \\- Word-by-word captions generated from audio timestamps\n4. **Sound effects** \\- AI suggests and places sound effects per scene\n5. **metadata** \\- Auto-generates title, description, tags, hashtags\n6. **Cloud rendering** \\- Video renders serverless, no local resources needed\n\n**The stack:**  \n\\- GPT-5.2/Opus 4.5 for script writing  \n\\- ElevenLabs + RVC for voice generation/cloning  \n\\- Whisper for audio transcription/timing  \n\\- Remotion for video composition  \n\\- Azure serverless for rendering\n\nNow it takes \\~3 minutes from topic to finished video.\n\nHappy to talk about the automation architecture if anyone's interested.",

So we looked into it and it seemed like customers and these AI tools were running super long tail questions behind the scenes to find answers! So we setup an automation using AI tools like Frizerly that is fully trained on our company and product context to automatically look at search queries and trends on Google to auto publish useful blogs answering these questions on our website. For example: \"What is the best tool for small businesses to automate invoice followups for customers?\" etc! We post like 3 of these automatically every week and now we are often mentioned by AI overview, ChatGPT etc as the go to option over out competitors! So that would be one :)",

A website changes a small thing. An auth flow expires. A script succeeds but returns partial data. Suddenly the automation is still “running” but the output is quietly wrong. You only notice weeks later when numbers stop making sense. Debugging after the fact is way harder than building the thing in the first place.\n\nFor me, the biggest pain point has always been anything that touches the web. Scraping, form filling, pulling data from dashboards. It is rarely the logic that fails, it is the environment. I started treating web interaction as infrastructure instead of just another step in the workflow. Using more controlled browser execution, including experimenting with tools like hyperbrowser, reduced a lot of silent failures because the behavior was more consistent run to run.\n\nCurious how others here think about resilience. Do you add more checks and alerts? Snapshot outputs and diff them? Or do you just accept that automations need regular babysitting once they leave the prototype stage?",

We also have a centralized repo of customer info automatically created.

Thanks to LLMs and AI tools like Frizerly, the whole process is now automated! It's able to look at Google analytics and automatically come up with both a strategy and content and post it directly on our website with content specifically trained on our product and case studies!\n* Translations: Again, before LLMs, we had to hire freelancers to translate content because we need most of our content in both english and French! Now we have an automation that auto translates all our content from English behind the scenes!\n\nFollowing to see what others have it going :)",

Before you needed perfect templates or regex hell. Now you just throw PDFs at an LLM and ask for specific fields in JSON. Works on varying formats without rewriting rules every time.\n\nReal improvement though is anything involving understanding unstructured text - summarizing, categorizing, extracting intent.

Before GenAI, automating this process required training a model for each document type and often broke down when documents didn’t follow the format it was trained on. Now, with tools powered by LLMs, the whole process is faster, smarter, and way more flexible.\n\nFor instance, platforms like kudra ai (affiliated) use AI to extract data from unstructured documents, think contracts, invoices, or even shipping manifests, and turn it into structured, searchable information in seconds. What’s cool is that the AI actually understands the context, so it works even if the document formatting is non-standard or the language is nuanced. Plus, you can build custom workflows to not just extract data but also analyze it, which saves a ton of time for industries like finance, logistics, and legal.\n\nSo yeah, I’d say document handling is one area that’s gone from “meh automation” to “crazy efficient” thanks to GenAI.",

Couldn't even go back and iterate on it without waiting for the next billing cycle.\n\nTried moving to VS Code to keep editing but the whole flow felt broken at that point.\n\nI got curious about how the whole thing actually works. Spent a few hours digging into Remotion, understanding how Claude was orchestrating everything, and ended up building my own agent that does something similar.\n\nBeen using it for the past few weeks to make explainer videos and product demos. Still rough around the edges but it works. I can actually iterate now without watching my credits disappear.\n\nI never really cracked motion graphics before this. Tried After Effects, tried Canva videos, tried a bunch of other tools. Nothing stuck. The Claude + Remotion combo was the first time I actually finished a video I was happy with. So when the credits ran out I just wanted to keep that going.\n\nAnyway, mostly posting to see if anyone else ran into the same quota problem or if people are even interested in prompt-to-video stuff outside of the Claude ecosystem.

Make ($15/mo for me) handles the workflows I share with my VA since the interface is friendlier.

It messages you first with briefings and reminders. One guy negotiated $4,200 off a car through it. Another rebuilt his website via Telegram while watching Netflix.\n\n30,000+ GitHub stars. Mac Mini sales through the roof. People calling it “Jarvis that already exists.”\n\nLet’s break it down:\n\nBy default, it uses cloud models - your files, code, and private data potentially flowing through external servers. The “local-first” label is a bit misleading when inference still happens in the cloud.\n\nWant mobile access? You’ll need SSH tunnels, Tailscale, or VPNs. SSH can’t be established reliably if your home IP isn’t static without some middleman service. Tailscale encrypts the connection - but once your messages hit Telegram or WhatsApp servers and get decrypted on their end, you’re trusting them with every command, every file, every piece of context you share with your AI.\n\nThen there’s prompt injection. A malicious email, webpage, or document could theoretically instruct your AI to exfiltrate data or execute commands you never intended. One user nailed it: “Don’t give it access to anything you wouldn’t give a new contractor on day one.”\n\nNo directory sandboxing by default. Full system access out of the box.\n\nCool tool? Absolutely. Powerful? No question.\n\nBut is “local-first” the same as truly private? Is running locally enough when your data still touches third-party servers? And when one bad prompt can compromise your entire system - is the convenience worth the risk?\n\nWorth thinking about before you hand over the keys.",

The result was silent failures, missing records and teammates losing trust in automation altogether. What actually fixed it was treating workflows like real systems: using error outputs where supported, adding simple success checks on critical nodes like databases, validating AI responses before chaining them and adding basic monitoring so I know when something breaks instead of hearing it from a user. Once I rebuilt with those principles, the same workflow ran for weeks without surprises and became boring in the best way possible.

      "text": "I understand this might not be the most receptive sub to post this in, but I just cannot stand how some people use AI when it comes to coding! I gotta rant!\n\nFor reference, I am at my first real automation job, I graduated last year with a diploma in automation and robotics and now work at an engineering company designing mining equipment. I am working on one project, and am the only guy working on it, but I have taken over it from someone who has left the company now.\n\nThe biggest part of the project is controlling some motors with a microcontroller programmed in C. I haven't used C in a while, so I have been taking my time trying to remember how it works and how to understand his code... and I just can't. His code is so poorly written that I have to essentially rewrite the whole thing from scratch because it is so hard to understand. The worst part was, even he couldn't explain it to me! His comments make no sense and before he left he didn't really seem to know what it was doing. It worked sure, but I can't integrate it to other systems or add onto it if I can't understand how it's working.\n\nFast forward to today, where I got so frustrated with something in my new code not working I caved and asked chatgpt. I personally do not like using AI for my work, because I want to understand how it works myself, but when I cannot find an answer elsewhere it helps. It spat out some example code at me and I was shocked because it was formatted almost exactly like the code I was trying to replace. I fed some of the old code back into it, and it said it was highly likely that it was AI generated. Suddenly it made so much sense why the guy before me couldn't explain how it worked - he didn't write it!\n\nNow I am going to have to spend likely a week or more just rewriting the code so that I can add more systems to it later all because he couldn't be bothered to understand what he was writing. I think AI has its uses, and I know it has helped me when I'm slamming my head into a wall sometimes, but people who use it to write all of their code are only going to cause more time to be wasted down the line.\n\nRant done! I'm over it! Onward!",

      "text": "Not saying those tools are bad, I used them. But if you’re building or reselling AI voice \nagents for businesses, here’s what kept happening to me. I’d build a solid agent on Vapi or Bland or Retell, the demo is great, and then I lose way more time on everything around it \nthan on the agent itself. Designing the flow, connecting integrations to the client tools, \ndealing with edge cases, and then debugging the glue (n8n / zapier / webhooks) every time \nsomething breaks or just act different in prod. At some point I realized I wasn’t really selling \n“a voice agent”, I was selling a fragile stack. \n\n\nWhat changed for me is PearlVibe from nlpearl.ai, because it builds the flow AND the \nintegrations automatically. Instead of building an agent here, a workflow there, and \nconnecting everything with external automation tools, I can literally describe the workflow in chat like “qualify the caller + Integrate with my google sheet drive, if they’re qualified create/update the google sheet, send a summary to the team, book a meeting with google cal, and if it’s support open a ticket” and PearlVibe turns that into something deployable with the logic + integrations already wired. For me that’s the big difference. Less tools, less glue, less debugging, faster iterations so faster deployments.\n\n\nAnd the other part that makes it actually sellable long term (not just a cool demo) is \nanalytics. Clients want visibility. Being able to see conversions, sentiment analysis, drop off, \nand where the flow gets stuck changes the whole convo. It becomes optimization + ROI, not “wow the bot talks”. \n\n\nResult is I spend way less time wiring / troubleshooting and way more time shipping \nworkflows clients actually keep using. Curious if other people here hit the same wall, what’s \nbeen your biggest time sink? flow design, integrations, reliability, analytics?",

That part's true.\n\nBut claiming one platform solves it all sounds too good. Every \"all-in-one\" tool I've used either locks you in, costs way more at scale, or can't handle edge cases without hacking workarounds anyway.",
