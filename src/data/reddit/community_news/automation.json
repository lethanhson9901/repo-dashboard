So we looked into it and it seemed like customers and these AI tools were running super long tail questions behind the scenes to find answers! So we setup an automation using AI tools like Frizerly that is fully trained on our company and product context to automatically look at search queries and trends on Google to auto publish useful blogs answering these questions on our website. For example: \"What is the best tool for small businesses to automate invoice followups for customers?\" etc! We post like 3 of these automatically every week and now we are often mentioned by AI overview, ChatGPT etc as the go to option over out competitors! So that would be one :)",

From a QA perspective, reliability matters more than novelty (I’d rather use something boring that runs consistently than something flashy that needs constant tweaking)\n\nWe’ve tested a few different approaches, including tools like askui that focus on interacting with the UI more like a human would instead of relying purely on selectors. It helped in some of the messier flows, but it also made it obvious how much variability there still is in real-world interfaces.\n\nfor anyone who’s rolled out ai-based automation, which tools actually stuck and made it into your day-to-day? honest experiences only.",

If the automation only works for the people who built it, it never survives contact with ops, QA, or audits. The tools that last are the ones where failure modes are obvious, logs are readable, and someone non technical can tell what went wrong without guessing.

      "text": "Headline is the question.\n\nMost automations we’ve created work great at the beginning. Then you put them on a daily schedule and the cracks show up fast. A website changes a small thing. An auth flow expires. A script succeeds but returns partial data. Suddenly the automation is still “running” but the output is quietly wrong. You only notice weeks later when numbers stop making sense. Debugging after the fact is way harder than building the thing in the first place.\n\nFor me, the biggest pain point has always been anything that touches the web. Scraping, form filling, pulling data from dashboards. It is rarely the logic that fails, it is the environment. I started treating web interaction as infrastructure instead of just another step in the workflow. Using more controlled browser execution, including experimenting with tools like hyperbrowser, reduced a lot of silent failures because the behavior was more consistent run to run.\n\nCurious how others here think about resilience. Do you add more checks and alerts? Snapshot outputs and diff them? Or do you just accept that automations need regular babysitting once they leave the prototype stage?",

What’s cool is that the AI actually understands the context, so it works even if the document formatting is non-standard or the language is nuanced. Plus, you can build custom workflows to not just extract data but also analyze it, which saves a ton of time for industries like finance, logistics, and legal.\n\nSo yeah, I’d say document handling is one area that’s gone from “meh automation” to “crazy efficient” thanks to GenAI.",

      "text": "So the Claude Code + Remotion skill went viral recently. I tried it out and honestly the video it made was pretty good. But I burned through my entire $20 monthly quota just generating one 2-minute video. Couldn't even go back and iterate on it without waiting for the next billing cycle.\n\nTried moving to VS Code to keep editing but the whole flow felt broken at that point.\n\nI got curious about how the whole thing actually works. Spent a few hours digging into Remotion, understanding how Claude was orchestrating everything, and ended up building my own agent that does something similar.\n\nBeen using it for the past few weeks to make explainer videos and product demos. Still rough around the edges but it works. I can actually iterate now without watching my credits disappear.\n\nI never really cracked motion graphics before this. Tried After Effects, tried Canva videos, tried a bunch of other tools. Nothing stuck. The Claude + Remotion combo was the first time I actually finished a video I was happy with. So when the credits ran out I just wanted to keep that going.\n\nAnyway, mostly posting to see if anyone else ran into the same quota problem or if people are even interested in prompt-to-video stuff outside of the Claude ecosystem. Curious what others are building.",

Broken locators, environment data, timing flake, app changes, and truly valid bugs. You will usually find a small set of root causes creates most of the red. Fixing those gives you leverage. Then identify the 50 to 200 tests that cover the highest value paths and make those stable first. Everything else becomes backlog until proven useful.\n\nAlso, set expectations with your manager early. “Healthy” needs a definition, like X percent pass rate on a smoke suite that gates releases, not perfection across 2000 scripts.

It messages you first with briefings and reminders. One guy negotiated $4,200 off a car through it. Another rebuilt his website via Telegram while watching Netflix.\n\n30,000+ GitHub stars. Mac Mini sales through the roof. People calling it “Jarvis that already exists.”\n\nLet’s break it down:\n\nBy default, it uses cloud models - your files, code, and private data potentially flowing through external servers. The “local-first” label is a bit misleading when inference still happens in the cloud.\n\nWant mobile access? You’ll need SSH tunnels, Tailscale, or VPNs. SSH can’t be established reliably if your home IP isn’t static without some middleman service. Tailscale encrypts the connection - but once your messages hit Telegram or WhatsApp servers and get decrypted on their end, you’re trusting them with every command, every file, every piece of context you share with your AI.\n\nThen there’s prompt injection. A malicious email, webpage, or document could theoretically instruct your AI to exfiltrate data or execute commands you never intended. One user nailed it: “Don’t give it access to anything you wouldn’t give a new contractor on day one.”\n\nNo directory sandboxing by default. Full system access out of the box.\n\nCool tool? Absolutely. Powerful? No question.\n\nBut is “local-first” the same as truly private? Is running locally enough when your data still touches third-party servers? And when one bad prompt can compromise your entire system - is the convenience worth the risk?\n\nWorth thinking about before you hand over the keys.",

I started a tech agency a year ago instead of sitting for placements.\n\n**The Situation:** I have the tech stack, the IP, and a proven model. We are projected to do \\~50-60L ($60k–$70k) in revenue this year with about 30 high-paying clients. I have a small sales team across India and the US, but our bottleneck is scale.\n\n**The Deal:** I have an opportunity to partner with a larger company that dominates distribution in my niche. They want 50% economical ownership of my company. In exchange, I get immediate access to their massive network and distribution channels.\n\n**The Dilemma:**\n\n1. **The Upside:** We could grow exponentially faster using their network.\n2. **The Downside:** I lose 50% equity and control. If I say no, they might become a direct competitor.\n3. **The Trust Issue:** My co-founder and family do not trust this partner. My gut says the distribution is worth it, but their instincts are making me hesitate.\n\n**The Question:** Is it worth giving up 50% equity for guaranteed distribution? Or should I grind it out independently with my own sales team (slower growth, 100% control) and risk fighting them as a competitor?\n\nHas anyone here taken a 50/50 distribution deal, and did you regret it?",

Join and check other community groups. 50% sounds like a lot and if your partner has been trustworthy, I would trust him. You should look at other options before settling.\n\nIs there anyway you could consult with someone  else who has a network that is worth less than 50% equity of your company? You said you have a proven scalable method. Anyway, you could interest them in a smaller portion of equity or another type of shareholder value to your company with different rights…even looking at possible different terms of that with lower ownership equity amount…\n\nJust some solutions from a quick review with Claude:\n\nAlternative Structures to Explore\nDon’t accept their first offer. Here are better frameworks:\n1. Revenue Share Partnership (No Equity)\n\t∙\tThey get 20-30% of revenue from clients they source\n\t∙\tYou retain 100% equity and control\n\t∙\tTime-bound agreement (2-3 years) with performance milestones\n\t∙\tLower risk, maintains optionality\n\n2. Tiered Equity with Vesting\n\t∙\tStart with 20% equity tied to performance milestones\n\t∙\tEarn up to 50% only if they deliver X revenue over Y timeframe\n\t∙\tIncludes buyback provisions if relationship fails\n\t∙\tProtects you from giving equity for empty promises\n\n3. Strategic Investment Model\n\t∙\tThey invest capital at a fair valuation for 25-30% equity\n\t∙\tYou use capital to build your own distribution team\n\t∙\tThey provide intros/network access without operational control\n\t∙\tCleaner cap table, maintains your control\n\n4. Joint Venture Structure\n\t∙\tCreate a separate entity for the partnership (60/40 or 70/30 in your favor)\n\t∙\tYour tech company remains independent\n\t∙\tJV licenses your IP, they contribute distribution\n\t∙\tLimits downside, protects your core asset\n\nMy Recommendation: Structured Counter-Proposal\n\nStep 1: Test Their Commitment\nPropose a 90-day pilot partnership:\n\t∙\tNo equity exchanged\n\t∙\tThey source clients, you deliver service\n\t∙\tRevenue split: 70/30 (you/them) on pilot clients\n\t∙\tBoth parties evaluate fit before discussing equity\nThis reveals:\n\t∙\tWhether their distribution is real or overhyped\n\t∙\tHow they operate as partners\n\t∙\tWhether the relationship has cultural fit\n\nStep 2: Negotiate from Data\nIf pilot works, come back with:\n\t∙\t25% equity (not 50%) with 4-year vesting tied to revenue milestones\n\t∙\tProtective provisions: Board seat, drag-along rights, IP protection clauses\n\t∙\tBuyback option: If they don’t hit milestones, you can repurchase equity at predetermined valuation\n\t∙\tNon-compete agreement: They cannot build competing tech for X years\n\nStep 3: Build Alternatives Simultaneously\nWhile negotiating:\n\t∙\tInvest heavily in YOUR sales team and distribution\n\t∙\tExplore other potential distribution partners\n\t∙\tDocument your IP and consider defensive patents/trademarks\n\t∙\tBuild leverage by showing you don’t need them, you’re just open to acceleration",

If he’s not Mark Cuban on one of the other dudes on Shark Tank that’s a bad deal. You can automate your marketing w/ n8n and/or Notion for less than $15 a month including blogs, a calendar, todo lists, all centralized. The only thing I would say would be valuable in this circumstance that I don’t have enough details on in all fairness, is who that person is and who he knows. If he has a network with the second and third level contacts that have money and reputation, that’s a different story. 50% under any circumstances unacceptable because all it takes is a smart stock play and now he’s the owner of the company. I would say I only wanna give you 20, let him say no two times, and then break and say I’ll give you 30% with an extra 30% that profit of sales. He walks away, feeling like he won.

The result was silent failures, missing records and teammates losing trust in automation altogether. What actually fixed it was treating workflows like real systems: using error outputs where supported, adding simple success checks on critical nodes like databases, validating AI responses before chaining them and adding basic monitoring so I know when something breaks instead of hearing it from a user. Once I rebuilt with those principles, the same workflow ran for weeks without surprises and became boring in the best way possible.

      "text": "I understand this might not be the most receptive sub to post this in, but I just cannot stand how some people use AI when it comes to coding! I gotta rant!\n\nFor reference, I am at my first real automation job, I graduated last year with a diploma in automation and robotics and now work at an engineering company designing mining equipment. I am working on one project, and am the only guy working on it, but I have taken over it from someone who has left the company now.\n\nThe biggest part of the project is controlling some motors with a microcontroller programmed in C. I haven't used C in a while, so I have been taking my time trying to remember how it works and how to understand his code... and I just can't. His code is so poorly written that I have to essentially rewrite the whole thing from scratch because it is so hard to understand. The worst part was, even he couldn't explain it to me! His comments make no sense and before he left he didn't really seem to know what it was doing. It worked sure, but I can't integrate it to other systems or add onto it if I can't understand how it's working.\n\nFast forward to today, where I got so frustrated with something in my new code not working I caved and asked chatgpt. I personally do not like using AI for my work, because I want to understand how it works myself, but when I cannot find an answer elsewhere it helps. It spat out some example code at me and I was shocked because it was formatted almost exactly like the code I was trying to replace. I fed some of the old code back into it, and it said it was highly likely that it was AI generated. Suddenly it made so much sense why the guy before me couldn't explain how it worked - he didn't write it!\n\nNow I am going to have to spend likely a week or more just rewriting the code so that I can add more systems to it later all because he couldn't be bothered to understand what he was writing. I think AI has its uses, and I know it has helped me when I'm slamming my head into a wall sometimes, but people who use it to write all of their code are only going to cause more time to be wasted down the line.\n\nRant done! I'm over it! Onward!",

Preferably an out of the box solution, but if it doesn’t exist I’d like to hear suggested workflows\n\nCurrent LLMs do an okay job at finding relevant sources, but they kinda suck at being time-sensitive or finding anything under-the-radar. The ones I’ve tried also don’t allow me to feed them custom links for websites that prioritize\n\nI have a bunch of websites I monitor manually, so ideally I’d just want a tool that:\n\nA) Crawls through websites I have provided at a scheduled time (e.g. once a week)\n\nB) Filters out relevant information based on the prompt I’ve provided\n\nC) Outputs a weekly lead gen & news report. It’s important that it only outputs \\*new\\* info - Grok’s task scheduler reports a bunch of old stuff and sends me weekly reports containing info I’ve already received\n\nAny suggestions?

But there are technical ways to handle it.\n​To ensure timing, you need to master Reddit’s search parameters, like sorting by 'relevance' or 'new' and limiting the time range with 't=hour'. From what we've seen, using 'sort=new' usually pulls in way too much trash, so finding the right balance is key. In Huntopic, I pair these specific settings with a database-level deduplication layer to discard anything already seen before any analysis happens.\n​For filtering, instead of relying on keywords alone, an intent-validation pipeline is essential. It focuses on identifying actual pain points or buying signals while filtering out generic discussions.\n​What stack are you using for this automation, or are you looking for an out-of-the-box solution that already handles this?",

      "text": "Not saying those tools are bad, I used them. But if you’re building or reselling AI voice \nagents for businesses, here’s what kept happening to me. I’d build a solid agent on Vapi or Bland or Retell, the demo is great, and then I lose way more time on everything around it \nthan on the agent itself. Designing the flow, connecting integrations to the client tools, \ndealing with edge cases, and then debugging the glue (n8n / zapier / webhooks) every time \nsomething breaks or just act different in prod. At some point I realized I wasn’t really selling \n“a voice agent”, I was selling a fragile stack. \n\n\nWhat changed for me is PearlVibe from nlpearl.ai, because it builds the flow AND the \nintegrations automatically. Instead of building an agent here, a workflow there, and \nconnecting everything with external automation tools, I can literally describe the workflow in chat like “qualify the caller + Integrate with my google sheet drive, if they’re qualified create/update the google sheet, send a summary to the team, book a meeting with google cal, and if it’s support open a ticket” and PearlVibe turns that into something deployable with the logic + integrations already wired. For me that’s the big difference. Less tools, less glue, less debugging, faster iterations so faster deployments.\n\n\nAnd the other part that makes it actually sellable long term (not just a cool demo) is \nanalytics. Clients want visibility. Being able to see conversions, sentiment analysis, drop off, \nand where the flow gets stuck changes the whole convo. It becomes optimization + ROI, not “wow the bot talks”. \n\n\nResult is I spend way less time wiring / troubleshooting and way more time shipping \nworkflows clients actually keep using. Curious if other people here hit the same wall, what’s \nbeen your biggest time sink? flow design, integrations, reliability, analytics?",

Every \"all-in-one\" tool I've used either locks you in, costs way more at scale, or can't handle edge cases without hacking workarounds anyway.",

Still needed human in the loop constantly.\n\nThe shift for me was discovering agent groups. Instead of linear workflows where you define every branch, you have specialized agents that can actually reason about what to do next.\n\nSet up a research pipeline recently. One agent finds sources, another evaluates relevance, third synthesizes findings. They debate with each other when theres conflicting info. A supervisor decides when to escalate to me vs handle autonomously.\n\nUsing LobeHub for this, honestly feels like a generational leap from traditional automation tools. The multi model support is nice too, some tasks work better with claude others with gpt.\n\nThe mental model shift: traditional automation is \"if this then that\". Agent groups are more like \"heres the goal, figure out the steps\". Way more flexible for messy real world tasks.\n\nDownside is less predictable than rule based automation. Sometimes agents go off track. But for knowledge work where you cant predefine every scenario? Game changer.",
