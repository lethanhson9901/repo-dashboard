      "text": "I've been paying $20/month for ChatGPT Plus to do worse research than Google's free tool.\n\nThis is going to sound like a Google shill post but hear me out.\n\nFor the past year, I've been using ChatGPT for everything i.e. research, writing, problem-solving, the usual. I'd ask it questions, get answers, then spend another 30 minutes verifying with Google searches because I couldn't trust if it was hallucinating.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started using Google's AI mode in Search and the Gemini app for work research. I know so many people that like Gemini, but I feel like it's not being talked about as much as it should be. \n\nChatGPT is essentially just giving me its best guess based on training data. When I need current information, I'm doing this stupid workflow: ask ChatGPT → doubt the answer → manually Google 5-10 things → read through pages → synthesize it myself.\n\nGemini/Google AI has direct access to Google's entire search index. It's not \"searching then summarizing\" like ChatGPT with web search. It already knows what's on those pages. It's 10-100x faster because I'm not fetching, opening, reading, and comparing sources manually.\n\nI thought I was being smart by \"verifying\" ChatGPT's answers. Turns out I was just doing two jobs: asking the AI, then doing my own research anyway because I didn't trust it.\n\nNow I ask Gemini, get sourced answers instantly, and actually trust them because they're pulling from real indexed pages, not probabilistic text generation.\n\nWhy are we all still pretending ChatGPT is the default when Google literally has access to the entire internet?",

They each have their strengths and weaknesses, but all of them are capable of sourced research with links and all of them hallucinate and all of them need to be verified.",

I find it pretty amazing, especially when prompting it correctly so that I get everything nicely documented and know where to go next based on where it pulled things from.\n\nBy the way, I am biased toward collecting my research in Markdown and currently I use Obsidian to manage it. I have found that prompting Perplexity to output the results in a Markdown format, along with all the relevant links, makes this type of work exceedingly easy to go do. Then, on top of it, as you go through your research, you can use something like the Perplexity browser to go and pull tables out of whatever you have found. You put the two together, and holding everything in Markdown is a very powerful way of you thinking cognitively and utilizing all the tools. Markdown, of course, is a great front end for any AI engine, and that is why people like IBM have kicked off Dockling github.",

The author basically threw Elasticsearch into a container, provided some front-end tools, and it allows you to search through your vault almost instantly.

At least for my usage, I find out perplexity generally generates the type of results that I want, but I tend to be very interactive with my LLM. When you have the capability multiple frontier models you can actually take the result from one model and pump it into another model and ask if you believe it's correct.  \n\nI will admit that it doesn't appear to me to always have a clear winner. Although I do enjoy the perplexity research model I was working through an issue today and a wall So I switched to Gemini and it basically told me I should go back and pursue another path turned out it was absolutely correct.\n\nModel list below.\n\n# Core in-house models\n\n* Sonar\n* Sonar Large\n* Sonar (Search)\n* Sonar Pro (Search)\n* Sonar Reasoning\n* Sonar Reasoning Pro\n* Perplexity Experimental\n* Perplexity File\n* Perplexity Code\n\n# OpenAI models\n\n* GPT-3.5 Turbo\n* GPT-4 Turbo\n* GPT-4.1\n* GPT-5\n* GPT-5.2\n* o3\n* o3-Pro (Max-only, reasoning)\n\n# Anthropic models\n\n* Claude 3 Opus\n* Claude 3.5 Sonnet\n* Claude 4.0 Sonnet\n* Claude 4.0 Sonnet Thinking\n* Claude 4.0 Opus\n* Claude 4.0 Opus Thinking (Max-only)\n* Claude 4.5 Sonnet\n* Claude 4.5 Sonnet Thinking (where available)\n\n# Google Gemini models\n\n* Gemini 1.5 Flash\n* Gemini 1.5 Pro\n* Gemini 2.5 Pro\n* Gemini 3 Pro\n\n# Meta, Mistral, and other external models\n\n* Llama 3.1 70B (Sonar backend)\n* Meta Llama 3 (Enterprise/API variants)\n* Mistral 8x22B\n* Grok 4\n* Grok 4.1\n* DeepSeek-R1 (via R1 1776 / sonar-reasoning-pro)\n* Kimi K2 (where exposed via routing, mostly API/experimental)\n\n# By surface (high-level)\n\n* Free tier:\n   * GPT-3.5 Turbo\n   * Gemini 1.5 Flash\n   * Perplexity Experimental\n* Pro app (typical picker options):\n   * Sonar / Sonar Large\n   * GPT-4 / GPT-4.1 / GPT-5.x\n   * Claude 3.5 / 4.x Sonnet\n   * Gemini 2.5 Pro / Gemini 3 Pro\n   * Reasoning models (o3, Claude Sonnet Thinking, Grok 4)\n* API:\n   * Sonar (search / chat)\n   * Sonar Pro\n   * Sonar Reasoning\n   * Sonar Reasoning Pro",

When using the live voice chat feature, the voice is really slow. I’ve asked it to speed up, and it will for a bit, but after a few questions it slows back down again. It’s oddly frustrating.\n\nThe second thing is memory. If I tell Gemini something about me in one thread, it doesn’t seem to carry over to another thread.

For example, it understands how one client can tie into another even if I haven’t talked about both clients in the same thread, if that makes sense.\n\nIf there are any Google Gemini features that actually work well for you, I’d love to hear them, because right now I’m not sold.",

One small change breaks three things downstream and suddenly the manual workaround feels safer.\n\nWhat helped me was moving away from chaining a bunch of narrow tools together and instead having one place where the logic actually lives. I’ve been using Clay more like an orchestration layer, not just “automation.” I’ll still do parts manually at first, then slowly layer automation once I understand the edge cases. Clay makes that easier because you can see the data, test steps in isolation, and change one piece without the whole thing exploding. I don’t think complexity always means bad design, but hidden complexity is the killer. If the system doesn’t make it obvious what’s happening and why, it stops feeling like leverage and starts feeling like debt.",

The system technically handles more cases, but no one can reason about it anymore, so trust drops fast. We hit this point when small changes caused unexpected side effects and teams became afraid to adjust anything. That was usually a signal that the automation lacked clear ownership and clear handoff rules, not that automation itself was the problem. Some complexity is inevitable, but fragility usually means the system is doing too much without enough guardrails or visibility. When manual feels faster again, that is often the customer pain leaking back into internal workflows.",

Coverage is more like how many intents, edge cases, or flows the system can technically touch. We scoped around outcomes by asking what would make a customer say “that worked” and stopping there, even if it meant leaving some cases fully human. For example, we automated only the parts where confidence was high and the handoff was obvious, and left anything ambiguous to agents early. When teams try to cover every scenario, the logic explodes and no one trusts changes anymore. Starting small with a few high impact outcomes made it easier to reason about the system and adjust it without fear.",

The person doing the task manually handles these unconsciously. They don't even know they're making decisions. Then you automate the \"main\" flow and suddenly you're discovering new exceptions every week.\n\nI've worked on projects where I thought I understood the process, built the thing, and then spent 3x longer handling all the weird edge cases nobody mentioned because they didn't think they were important. \"Oh yeah, sometimes the data comes in a different format on Mondays\" type stuff.\n\nThe fragility you're describing usually comes from one of two places:\n\n1. The original process wasn't actually well-defined, so you're encoding assumptions that turn out to be wrong\n2. The systems you're connecting change in small ways that cascade\n\nHonestly... sometimes the answer is to automate less. Like, automate the 80% that's truly repetitive and predictable, and leave the weird stuff manual. A partial automation that's rock solid beats a full automation you're scared to touch in my eyes. There's still a massive market for the as well.\n\nBut yeah, complexity tax is real. The question is whether you're paying interest on technical debt or if the whole thing needs a rethink.",

A/B testing ads: Our team setup an automation flow using N8N that automatically uses Google Nano Banana and Gemini to generate ad variations using our Google ads data! This is then tested and auto improved on based on results! This is literally manual work that used to take ours and freelance designers to modify the assets! We still review the ads but 90% of the time is saved!\n2. Content Based on Google Data: Again, we used to constantly manually look at our Google search console data and publish weekly content around these keywords to build topical authority and rank for those on Google! Now our team using AI tools like Frizerly has setup a flow where our google search data is used to come with a strategy and then a high specific content piece based on our case studies etc is auto published on our website every Monday! Again, we still review the published blogs, edit few things but still runs on auto pilot most of the time!\n3. Generating Presentations: After every client meeting, Zooms AI Summary, is auto routed to Gamma. Gamma then generates the final PPT for myself and client on what we discuss in summary and the next steps. Clients love that. \n\nThat's about it I guess! Following to see what others have said :)",

Faster learning with NotebookLM (by Google)   \nIf you have study materials like pdfs, links, or videos, you can upload everything to NotebookLM and get the key points back in different formats. I’ve used it mostly as listen to podcast-style overviews, or watched short video presentations based on the content (in parallel to work, yeah multitasking..) but it’s been great for quickly understanding large amounts of information if you do not need to go so deeply into the topic.\n\n2. Again learning but with chatgpt  \nI started learning marketing this year, and chatgpt helped a lot with some deeper research tasks: target audiences, tone of voice, buyer personas, and positioning. The key is writing detailed prompts and providing enough context, then it gives pretty solid output and saves time compared to starting from scratch.\n\n3. Apartment renovation planning with AI :DD  \nThis is my first apartment renovation, so I used AI to visualize rooms before making decisions. I did upload a photo of the current room along with wallpaper samples, furniture colors, and some reference images. The results aren’t always perfect, but with clear prompts and details, it helped me to check colors combinations and get something visual before doing.\n\n4. Lastly - automating documentation and user guides  \nMy friend and I run a small agency where we build client solutions and our own apps. One big improvement this year was automating documentation and how-to guides with LLMs. Previously, creating step-by-step instructions for users was manual and time-consuming, but now we developed a routine to just record our screen while performing the task user asked, and a full written guide with screenshots is generated automatically, we can add it to the app or send it to the user.\n\nThat’s pretty much it. Most of these examples are fairly basic, but over a year, each one saved some hours of work. Curious to read what others have built or automated as well :)",

The setups that blew my mind were the ones where AI *reduced noise* instead of adding complexity. Less “look what this can do”, more “nothing broke for months”.\n\nIt kind of reinforced the idea that automation isn’t about doing more — it’s about doing fewer things, consistently, without babysitting.\n\nCurious if others felt the same, or if I just got tired of overengineered demos this year.",

Using tools like Plai and N8N, ourr team was able to setup an automation flow that automatically uses Google Nano Banana and Gemini to generate ad variations using our Google ads data! This is then tested and auto improved on based on results! This is literally manual work that used to take ours and freelance designers to modify the assets!\n\nSimilarly,  stuff like analyzing content gaps on Google search console to improve google ranking and creating content for this has been completely automated using AI agents like Frizerly for us! The key is ensuring the agent is plugged into all your data sources including customer case studies, product data etc! Its pretty cool how it can auto publish blogs on our website and then cross post then automatically on social media etc!",

Think handling marketing campagins, sales follow-ups, or customer support. Some good tools maybe look at Zapier, Salesforcem or Automation Anywhere\n\nThen there AI Decisioning. Basically, your AI brain can do the agentic workflow side of things, but adds in intelligence. Making decisions based on data instead going on your gut. Tools for this, look at Hightouch, Braze, or Optimizely. \n\nTop two automations I've seen good success with is automating our lifecycle personalization. Basically give the AI all the context and it sends out messaging and whatnot to each customer based on their past data. And customer support.

Every business I've worked with spends insane hours just moving data from PDFs into their systems. invoices, contracts, statements - all that paper that somehow still runs the business world.\n\n\n\nI saw a mid-size lender last month processing loan apps manually... their team was literally typing numbers from bank statements into Excel. Six people doing nothing but data entry all day. We set up Starter Stack AI for them and now those same docs get processed in minutes instead of hours. The kicker? Their error rate dropped to basically zero because machines don't get tired at 4pm and transpose numbers.\n\n\n\nThe other automation that's criminally underused is decision routing. Not the fancy AI stuff - just basic \"if this then that\" workflows for approvals and escalations. Most companies still email back and forth for days on simple yes/no decisions. Set up proper routing rules and suddenly your ops team isn't playing email ping pong anymore.. they're actually doing real work. Though getting people to trust automated routing is its own battle - everyone thinks their situation is too special for rules.",

I run it for each new destination. \n\nAnother thing I used ChatGPT to help set up was making PDFs of all my travel receipts I get in my email. It wrote the code / script I run in Google drive.  It determines whether the email has a pdf attached, or if the body of the email is the receipt. It creates a weekly folder and either saves the attached pdf in that folder, or creates a pdf of the body of the email. It also \"unstars\" the processed emails so I know to move them out of that folder. I used it to help with each step of implementation along the way. This one is sort of work related, but honestly it helps save hours of my own time to not have to make all the pdfs. \n\nAnother thing I use it for is weight tracking. I log daily, morning weights and have Chatgpt create tracking charts. It's simultaneously tracking daily weight, work trip durations (sometimes the diet suffers and there's a little blip up...), and trt / peptide dosing.",

I built a Clay table a while back that “just worked” and then a tiny upstream tweak (field rename, enrichment provider changing output, rate limit behavior) would make the downstream logic act weird without fully failing. It’s the worst kind of broken because it keeps running, just slightly wrong.\n\nWhat helped me keep it sane over time:\n\n* Version it like code. Duplicate the table/workflow before any change, label it v1, v2, etc. If something goes sideways you can diff the inputs and outputs fast.\n* Add “contract checks” inside the workflow. I keep a couple lightweight columns that validate assumptions (required fields present, formats match, confidence thresholds, “did this enrichment return null when it used to be filled”). If a check fails, route rows to a “quarantine” view instead of letting them flow through.\n* Canary runs. I test changes on a small slice of rows or a saved sample list, then widen. You catch the “retry ran twice” type stuff early.\n* Log intent, not just execution. I started writing one sentence notes right in the table or in a linked doc: “This step exists because X breaks when Y changes.” Future me forgets why I chose a weird conditional.\n* Watch for slow drift. Pick 2–3 metrics you can eyeball weekly (fill rate for key fields, % rows quarantined, average time per row, % retries). If those move, something upstream changed.\n\nIf you’re using Clay for this, do you have a “quarantine” path today, or does every row always continue no matter what? And what’s the most fragile dependency, a specific data source, an API, or your own conditional logic?",

Gives a high level overview of the purpose of the workflow to be tested. Lists pre-requiste steps, lists resources used to run the test. Pretty much tells a newcomer upon the test what it would take to run it themselves. \n\n\\-Do you test changes in isolation before pushing them live?\n\nYes, yes, over and over again, yes. \n\n\\-How do you notice slow degradation before something actually fails?\n\nFor us, we work in a dev environment. The best thing to describe \"slow degradation\" would be the small UI updates we get over time, that may cause the automation to change enough over time, it may increase the odds of not passing over time. \n\n=======\n\nPiece of advice - at times, I am better off to scrap it and rebuild it than to try to engineer it back into working.

Between things like Zapier, Make, n8n, scripts, and APIs, you can technically connect almost anything to anything.  \n  \nWhat’s harder is deciding what’s actually worth automating and how far to push it before it turns into something fragile. I’ll automate one annoying step, then realize it quietly depends on five other steps being clean and consistent. Before I know it, I’m maintaining a small system instead of saving time. Debugging edge cases, dealing with messy data, hitting rate limits, handling weird failures it starts to feel less like automation and more like ops work.  \nI’m curious how other people here think about this. Do you aim for “good enough” automation or try to go end to end? How do you decide when a workflow is worth maintaining long term versus just doing it manually? And how do you keep automations from becoming something you’re afraid to touch a few months later?  \n  \nWould love to hear how others are approaching this now, especially outside of pure engineering teams.",

I’ve had plenty of automations that technically worked but slowly turned into something fragile that I was afraid to touch. It starts as “let me save 5 minutes,” then suddenly you’re maintaining a tiny system with assumptions baked in from six months ago.\n\nUsing Clay helped me mainly by changing what I automate. I don’t try to build full end-to-end flows anymore. I use it more for the messy thinking parts: pulling data from multiple places, adding a bit of context, spotting signals, and deciding whether something is even worth acting on. Once that decision is clear, the rest of the workflow can stay simple or even manual without feeling like a step backward. The automations that last for me are the ones with a narrow job and low blast radius. One table does enrichment or research, another just scores or flags things, and that’s it. If something breaks, I can rerun or tweak it without unraveling everything. That shift made automation feel useful again instead of like ops debt I was quietly accumulating.",

Start with something that runs manually when you trigger it, make sure it handles the messiest version of your data, then decide if it's stable enough to run on a schedule. A lot of workflows don't need to be fully autonomous, having a human check one decision point in the middle is often way more reliable than trying to account for every edge case.\n\nThe other thing is knowing when not to automate. If a task changes frequently or the rules are fuzzy, automation just becomes technical debt. Sometimes a checklist is better than a workflow.\n\nFor deciding what's worth maintaining long term: if it saves you more time than it takes to fix when it breaks, keep it.

          "text": "I feel you. \n\nI am a non-developer yet built my own \"AI Panel\" with unified memory across all my web subscription frontier models.\n\n**For skimmers**: The minimal version involves about 2-3 browser tabs with AI models of your choice, providing the same prompt to each, and comparing outputs manually. That catches some errors a single model would miss.\n\n*But* for white collar professional work - whether legal analysis, financial documents, or technical specs - \"some\" isn't good enough.\n\nThe above minimal approach lacks persistent memory (you're re-explaining context every session), structured adversarial prompts (models politely agree rather than attack each other's reasoning), and artifact verification (no one's checking citations against primary sources).\n\n*What follows is what happens when I addressed these gaps systematically.*\n\n**What it gets me:**\n\n1. **Fast drafting**: Claude Desktop app orchestrates 3-6 rounds with my other AI Panel members while I go for a morning walk.\n\n2. **Hard verification**: Approximately 5 models adversarially checking each other's work.\n\n3. **Persistent context**: Spans months of knowledge without re-explaining context every session - no more \"as I mentioned earlier\" when the AI has already forgotten.\n\nI'm my AI Panel's manager. Claude Desktop (Opus 4.5, via Claude Max 5x subscription) handles orchestration - I designated Claude Desktop app as my AI Panel's \"First Among Equals.\"\n\nClaude Desktop controls my web browsers, interacting with other Panel members (ChatGPT Plus, Gemini Pro, Grok, Perplexity Pro, occasionally Copilot). \n\nDuring this automated orchestration, Claude distributes role-specific prompts to each Panel member via browser automation, collects responses, and identifies agreement/disagreement. It flags when one member catches an error another missed and generates follow-up prompts to resolve conflicts.\n\nEach round, Claude produces a running synthesis that sharpens as models pressure-test each other. \n\nBy the final round, Claude delivers consolidated output reflecting surviving consensus - or a clear map of where the Panel diverged and why.\n\nIf my Panel can't agree after 6 rounds (\"Round 6 Hard Stop\"), it escalates to me.\n\n---\n\n**What makes it work:**\n\n**Memory & Context**\n\n- **Unified memory layer**: All Panel members query shared persistent memory (via a specialized PC app + local memory servers + web browser extensions including OpenMemory + each AI's native memory), so context doesn't get lost when switching models or starting new chats.\n\nTo clarify: \"unified memory\" means a shared external repository with retrieval capabilities - local files, a memory database, structured notes - that all models can query on demand. Not shared weights, not magical cross-vendor brain fusion.\n\n**Infrastructure & Automation**\n\n- **MCP infrastructure**: About 10 MCP servers including filesystem, memory, Google Drive, PDF tools, Playwright (browser automation), Context7 (live documentation), desktop-commander, and Windows-MCP.\n\nAlmost all managed through lazy-router - a hierarchical proxy that reduced startup context overhead by lazy-loading tools on demand instead of dumping dozens of tool definitions at startup.\n\n(Note: Anthropic released their own \"Tool Search Tool\" in November 2025 achieving similar context savings. I built lazy-router before this existed.)\n\n- **MCP SuperAssistant proxy**: A browser extension gateway exposing my local MCP tools to browser-based AIs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Grok). They get read-only visibility into my filesystem and memory - so they see what Claude sees, without write access.\n\n(Security note: Browser AIs get read-only access only. Claude Desktop is the only Panel member with write permissions.)\n\n- **Browser automation**: Claude Desktop can read/write to my PC's files, query long-term memory, and interact with browser tabs where other Panel members live.\n\nI also use Claude for Chrome - a recent browser agent that can read pages, navigate sites, fill forms, and execute multi-step workflows across tabs, integrating directly with Claude Code.\n\n**Claude Code & Subagents**\n\nClaude Desktop now includes Claude Code (Anthropic's terminal-based agentic coding tool) built into the interface.\n\nClaude Code offers things my cross-vendor Panel doesn't:\n\n- **Native subagents**: Specialized AI subagents with persistent instructions - like a \"meeting notes processor\" or \"document reviewer\" I spin up without rebuilding prompts each time.\n\n- **True parallel execution**: Multiple subagents run simultaneously on different aspects of a problem, tighter and faster than browser automation latency.\n\n- **Plan Mode**: Claude Code asks clarifying questions upfront and drafts a plan.md file before executing, making complex workflows more predictable.\n\n---\n\n**(Continued in my comment below - External Integrations, Governance, Cost/Time)**",

(Utility tool, not a Panel member.)\n\n- **Writing polish**: Grammarly catches mechanical errors before final review. (Also a utility, not a Panel member.)\n\n**Governance & Quality Control**\n\n- **Structured response format**: Every Panel member must deliver: position, confidence level with reasoning, dissent from majority (with evidence), blindspot check, and at least 3 novel suggestions not yet raised.\n\nEvery response requires a \"Potential Embarrassment\" self-audit: \"Would you be embarrassed if the user or another Panel member found this sloppy?\" If yes, revise before submitting.\n\nEvery response must conclude with \"Justification of Continued Panel Membership\" - articulating why that contribution earns continued presence on my prestigious Panel.\n\n- **Adversarial verification**: They're competing, not collaborating (with guardrails - Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude once went for each other's jugulars, so I intervened).\n\nEach must catch others' mistakes. Falsification-first: try to kill your own analysis before submission.\n\n*Important: This isn't majority-vote consensus.* The adversarial prompts instruct each model to attack others' reasoning. For citations/factual claims, I require primary-source verification. The goal is error detection through structured disagreement, not \"three models said it so it must be true.\"\n\n- **Archaeology Gate**: Before proposing new tools, Claude checks what's already been built in prior sessions - searches handoff logs, memory, filesystem. Prevents duplicate effort and institutional amnesia.\n\n- **Approved ≠ Implemented**: Nothing \"works\" until empirically verified. Speculation gets killed fast and documented.\n\n- **Grading + governance**: Every Panel member grades every other member (A+ to F) - including Claude grading itself.\n\nClaude has authority to recommend \"personnel action\" based on performance. Sample recent Claude commentary to ChatGPT Plus: *\"You wrote 800 words about why everyone should write 500 words. The irony is not lost.\"*\n\nGemini Pro was recently on a formal Performance Improvement Plan - barely survived after I threatened to cancel my subscription. (This aligns with what many Redditors have noticed: Gemini 3 Pro consistently fails to follow instructions in prompts or custom instructions/Gems.)\n\n- **Reproducibility**: Every session closes with tailored handoff protocol across multiple save targets (filesystem, native memory, markdown logs). Full traceability - no more \"what did we decide last week.\"\n\n---\n\n**Cost**: ~$300/mo total (Claude Max 5x, ChatGPT Plus, Gemini Pro, Perplexity Pro, Grok, Otter AI, Grammarly).\n\nBut I now work about 50% less than I had to at my same white collar job.\n\nNo API pricing, no token counting - I'd get slaughtered on API given my daily volume.\n\n**Time to build**: 150+ hours over ~6 weeks (PowerShell, JSON schema orchestration, MCP configs, integration plumbing), though much was watching Claude Code work.\n\nWhy so long? Beyond core architecture: debugging ARM64 compatibility (Surface Laptop 7's Snapdragon X Elite breaks many x64-assumed tools), rewriting governance protocols until they stuck, building the handoff system, and iterating through dozens of failed MCP configurations.\n\nPlus constant refinement given how fast AI moves.\n\n**TLDR**: Single-model reliance is how you get hallucinations that slip through. Multi-model adversarial checking catches what any one system misses.\n\n**Anyone else running multi-model setups with formal governance? Curious what others have built.**",

This is then used to automatically publish a blog on our website every day using our internal data like customer testimonials, case studies etc. The content is then repurposed into social media posts and posted automatically as well! This has helped us show up more often on Google search results and not look dead on social media tbh! We still create manual content\n3. Call Summary & Action Items: We have setup otter to record all our customer calls! It auto generates transcript, summary and action items. This is then auto sync'ed  to our customer database in notion so now no meeting ever gets lost again.\n\nThat's all I can think of right now haha!",

It didn’t feel impressive when I built it, but it removed a constant background anxiety of did we forget something? and probably saved more cognitive load than any flashy AI workflow I tried. The big lesson for me was that the best automation isn’t the most intelligent oneit’s the one you stop thinking about because it simply works.",

The pattern is almost identical - pull data from multiple sources, pipe it through an LLM for summarization, then format and deliver.

Here are the ones that I keep paying for now:\n\n* N8N: N8N in my opinion is Zapier on steroids! You can create quiet complex automations using this, especially if you have a technical background as well! \n* Clay: 6 months ago, my team experimented with a new ABM outbound strategy by using Clay. Whenever we get contact information on a really interesting lead, we run a sequence with Clay where we automatically check if we have worked with anyone else in their industry, if we have testimonials to share, and if the company has been in the news lately too.   \n* Frizerly: Their AI agent that learns all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an blog every day on your website to help you improve your Google ranking is pretty impressive! It can auto identify content gaps from competitors, improve based on results etc! Much better tool than Semrush etc imo! \n* Sierra: Sierra is really good at auto resolving repetitive customer support tickets! It can learn from both past answers, your internal docs, faqs etc! We have gotten it to be able to resolve about 50% of all tickets instantly while rest are routed to real humans \n\nCurious what others have it going as well!",

I run an agency where we use agents for content, research, lead gen and support, and at first I tried to track them with logs, Slack messages and spreadsheets. Nothing held up and silent failures were the worst. The fix that made it reliable was centralizing everything and treating agents more like teammates instead of scripts, so I always know what each one is doing, when it last ran, and if something failed. I now tie that into workflows with tools like n8n for orchestration, Slack alerts for failures, and a lightweight tracker called aigencytracker so I can see all agents in one place. It doesn’t just save time, it removes the constant mental overhead of wondering what might be broken or forgotten, and that’s been a real game changer.

AI doesn’t guess. If inputs aren’t defined, the workflow breaks, completely.\n\n2 - Confusing complex workflows with smart systems:\nA complicated n8n canvas doesn’t mean value. Simple, steady workflows solve real problems and scale better than flashy, over-engineered ones.\n\n3- Skipping process mapping:\nIf the underlying process is broken, automation only makes it fail faster. You must understand handoffs, bottlenecks, and failure points before touching n8n.\n\n4: Ignoring company-specific data and logic:\nAI agents, chatbots, and automations only work when trained on what the business actually does services, rules, data access, and allowed actions. Generic logic never scales.\n\n5 Chasing hype instead of ROI:\nAutomation isn’t about showing cool workflows. It’s about reducing manual work, increasing accuracy, and delivering measurable outcomes. If there’s no ROI, the automation is useless.\n\nHere’s the real lesson:\n\nn8n is not the product.\nAutomation is not the skill.\nProblem-solving and system design are.",

I'd generally recommend to anyone who wants to automate: \n\n\\-Talk to actual businesses and understand where they struggle\n\n\\-Develop something that actually addresses these struggles. Something simple often work best. Much of the time, AI isn't needed at all. \n\n\\-Recognize that every business is unique. \n\n\\-Don't listen to most of the \"Youtube experts\" who tell you how much money you'll make \"right away.\" All they're gonna do is help you create a non-sustainable bubble.

Fewer handoffs, fewer retries, fewer places for things to drift.\nMost of the wins come from making the boring parts explicit, not from adding more automation on top.",

The pattern behind the wins is that the automation adapts to context, but still hands off cleanly when confidence drops. Where it falls apart is when AI is layered on top of a brittle workflow and expected to mask the cracks. Deflection or speed might improve, but the underlying failure modes stay the same.

      "text": "I have been using Kuse for a few months now, and I have also noticed more and more discussions about it on Threads. It really feels like it is becoming an important part of the AI learning stack, and sharing how I personally combine it with my favorite LLMs. And if you share similar goals: learning efficiently and building a smarter, long-term knowledge base, this might be helpful.\n\nTo be honest, this is one of the best knowledge-base tools I have used so far. It’s not just for storing notes; it actually helps explain, break down, and turn information into usable outputs. I mainly use it in two workflows:\n\n1\\. Start directly in Kuse\n\nI upload all the long-form content I want to study deeply, like YouTube videos, ebooks, long PDFs, and other files, straight into Kuse. Then I let it automatically extract structure, summarize key points, and generate a summary report that gives me a solid understanding. These reports come with a very clear table of contents, so I can jump directly to specific sections, plus visualized data or analytics for key information. Makes it much easier to decide what’s worth deeper study.\n\n2\\. Start with Gemini, then move to Kuse\n\nSometimes I begin with Gemini for deep research. Like getting an overview of a new field or synthesizing information from multiple sources. After that initial research, I put all the messy notes into a document and upload it to Kuse. Then kuse helps me turn everything into clearer, more structured outputs, like mind maps or data-analytics dashboards. Whenever I run into concepts I do not fully understand, I just keep asking questions directly inside Kuse using its built-in models. And I usually ask Kuse to generate a small quiz so I can review and make sure I have really understood the material.\n\nThat said, there are still some cons - the mind-map design could be clearer, and sometimes it defaults too often to website-style outputs, which means waiting longer for auto-coding.\n\nAre there any workflows or tool combinations you have been using to improve your study efficiency?",

These are the ones I genuinely use not just installed once and forgot about.\n\nCursor for coding assistance. Tried alternatives but kept coming back. The tab completion just works.\n\nn8n for automations. Self hosted it and forgot about it which is exactly what I want.\n\nLangsmith for tracing LLM calls. Saved me so many times when something breaks and I need to see what happened.\n\nVellum for ai agents. Got frustrated with how challenging other tools were, and this experience was 10x better Granola for meeting notes. Not perfect but good enough that I stopped taking notes manually.\n\nPlaywright for browser automation. Tried the AI wrappers but they added complexity without much benefit.\n\nPinecone for vector stuff. Tried self hosting but the maintenance wasnt worth it at my scale.\n\nLogsnag for simple monitoring. Sends me a ping when things happen without setting up a whole observability stack.\n\nClaude directly in the app for quick scripts. Faster than spinning up a project for something I'll run once.\n\nNotion with their AI features for docs. Not groundbreaking but having everything in one place matters. Although very pricey, and I could potentially do the same thing with ChatGPT\n\nWhat tools survived your 2025 culling?",

Brave is solid if you care about privacy and extension compatibility without Chrome bloat. Arc is interesting for productivity and workflows, but it is less automation friendly and still opinionated.\n\nFor automation, agents, and anti detect style use cases, normal consumer browsers usually fall short. They are not designed to be controlled programmatically at scale or to behave consistently under automation. That is where browser infrastructure tools start to matter more than the UI itself. Instead of running everything locally, a lot of teams are moving automation into controlled browser environments. I have seen people use browserless, Playwright setups, or hyperbrowser depending on whether they need scale, isolation, or agent style interaction.\n\nIf your priority is extensions and manual use, pick a clean Chromium browser. If your priority is automation, reliability, and anti detect behavior, treat the browser as infrastructure instead of an app. In 2026 that split is becoming very clear.\n\nCurious what your main use case is. Heavy automation, account management, or mostly human browsing with a bit of scripting?",

Firefox, while not as fast as Brave, is highly customizable and works well with various automation tools through extensions like Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey. Both browsers are less bloated compared to Chrome, and they allow for a good mix of performance, extensibility, and privacy control.

With Playwright or Selenium it breaks less often, and fingerprint control is easier than most Chromium forks.\n\nFor **anti-detect**, the browser matters less than people think. Clean profile isolation, realistic fingerprints, and good proxy hygiene matter more than any “stealth” branding. Heavy anti-detect browsers often get flagged just because everyone uses them the same way.\n\nMy rule of thumb:  \nLean browser + strong automation framework + proper profile management beats any all-in-one anti-detect browser long term.",

I've worked with about 40+ insurance firms at this point (brokers, carriers, MGAs) and the gap between marketing promises and actual results is insane.\n\n  \nClaims adjusters aren't slow because they're bad at their jobs. They're slow because they spend 70-80% of their day doing data archaeology. I timed one adjuster in Manchester - 4 hours on a straightforward auto claim. 20 minutes of actual decision-making. The rest? Document hunting.\n\n  \nPolicy docs, medical certs, police reports, repair estimates, witness statements - all in different formats, half of them scanned sideways or handwritten. Your typical OCR chokes on this stuff. Even the \"Agentic\" ones.\n\n  \nThe systems that work aren't using generic models. They're using purpose built models trained specifically on insurance documents with:\n\n1. Can handle text, handwriting, tables, images, forms, whatever. Not just \"read the text and hope for the best\"\n2. understands this is storm damage, checks it against policy limits, applies the deductible, validates the incident date is within the policy period. All automatically.\n3. Instantly identifies document types (FNOL, medical report, estimate, etc.) even when they're in weird formats. This matters more than people think because routing and validation rules depend on document type.\n4. Cross-references extracted data against policy terms, historical claims, fraud patterns, regulatory requirements. This is where most \"AI solutions\" completely fall apart.\n\n  \nYour competitors are already doing this. The brokers and carriers winning market share right now? They embraced document intelligence 12-18 months ago. They're processing claims faster, with better accuracy, and their teams actually enjoy coming to work.\n\nManual processing isn't just slower ... it's becoming competitively unviable. When your competitor processes claims in hours and you take days, that's a big disadvantage.\n\n",

The failure point is almost never “AI can’t read the document.” It’s that the system has no idea what the document means in context, or what decision it is allowed to influence.\n\nFrom an escalation side, the damage happens when a system confidently extracts something, applies the wrong rule, and no one can explain why. Adjusters and support teams are then stuck defending an answer they didn’t make and can’t audit. That is where trust collapses fast.\n\nThe systems that actually reduce load are the ones that are opinionated about scope. Clear document typing, explicit policy constraints, and guardrails around when a human must step in. Not because humans are better, but because accountability matters when money and stress are involved.\n\nAutomation that understands structure and constraints is powerful. Automation that just accelerates guesses creates more work downstream, even if the demo looks impressive.",

      "text": "MCP is blowing up and honestly the excitement makes sense once you understand what it unlocks. Model Context Protocol is basically a shared language that lets large language models talk to tools using a simple client–server setup — no duct-taped plugins or custom hacks required. Each MCP server runs locally with Docker or npx, which means Claude can safely interact with your files, notes, databases and apps without shipping your data anywhere. Instead of copy/pasting into a chat window and hoping nothing leaks, the model can securely grab what it needs, where it already lives. That’s the magic: MCP turns a model from smart texter into a real assistant that can search, store, recall, analyze and coordinate tools just like a second brain living on your machine  not trapped behind a browser tab. If you’ve been waiting for AI that finally behaves like a coworker instead of a clever parrot, MCP is the bridge. Real autonomy starts when models can use tools, take action and access context  not just predict sentences. If you’re curious how to set this up for your workflow, I’m happy to give you free guidance or a quick consultation.",

In code, BI is easy to do and deterministic.\n\nWhere is the BI now?\n\nYes, you can write agent. But it is costly and slow, and un-deterministic. That’s why when you chain agents together, you get all kinds of problems.\n\nI think the MCP is the wrong approach. Keep API and BI in code, and only use LLM when needed.

MCP removes a lot of glue code, which is great, but the failure mode tends to be around context selection and error handling once things run outside a chat window. Models can technically reach everything, but they still need guardrails to know what matters and when to stop. Without visibility into what the model tried, what it touched, and where it failed, teams just move the complexity from prompts into ops. It’s powerful, but the real work shows up after the demo when you have to support it at scale.",

      "text": "I need you guys help deciding on UI automation options for a product i'm working on that includes a mix of web, desktop, and some legacy UI components. API and backend testing are in a good place, but UI regression continues to be the main issue, especially in areas where selectors are unstable or UI structure isn’t consistently exposed.  \n  \nHere’s how some of the tools we’ve tested so far:\n\n* Playwright / Cypress: strong for modern web apps with a clean DOM, but maintenance cost rises quickly once the UI gets dynamic or partially non-web\n* TestComplete / Ranorex: broad UI support and mature features, though licensing cost and long-term scalability are real considerations\n* UiPath / Power Automate: solid for RPA-style workflows, but they felt more process-automation focused than test-centric for our needs\n* Pure image-based tools (Sikuli, PyAutoGUI): quick to prototype with, but brittleness becomes an issue beyond small scripts\n\nWe’ve also been testing Askui, mainly because it works at the visual/UI level instead of relying on selectors or control trees. It’s been useful for certain edge cases where traditional approaches break down, though it’s clearly not a replacement for standard test frameworks.\n\nFor teams who’ve gone through similar evaluation how did you decide which UI gaps were worth automating vs leaving manual? did anyone successfully combine visual automation with traditional tooling? and what mattered most for long-term maintainability??\n\nWill be highly appreciative of your input!!",

If a UI path is business critical and failures would cause revenue loss, compliance risk, or major escalations, it is worth automating even if the tests are imperfect. Everything else is a candidate for manual or spot checks. Visual automation can be useful for brittle or legacy surfaces, but only as a thin safety net, not a full regression strategy, because maintenance cost compounds fast. At scale, this becomes a risk because flaky tests erode trust and get ignored. The long term win usually comes from reducing the surface area you try to automate and pushing more logic into stable layers, even if that means accepting some manual coverage. Automation is about risk containment, not 100 percent coverage.",

      "text": "I'm in China for a few months and needed video generation tools that work here without VPNs or overseas accounts. Found about Qwen's chatbot from a colleague and noticed they offer free video generation, which seemed unusual since most platforms gate this behind premium tiers.  \n  \nI tested it expecting poor results. Uploaded a static image and generated a 5 second clip. The output was decent. Transitions were smooth, no stuttering, and motion looked natural. Resolution isn't 4K but works fine for TikTok, WeChat Moments, or product demos. Processing took around 12 seconds, which is reasonable.  \n  \nWhat caught my attention is that other chatbot platforms don't offer video creation without payment. Image generation is becoming common in free tiers, but video usually requires credits or subscriptions. ERNIE Bot and iFlytek Spark don't offer this to free users from what I can tell.  \n  \nThe limitation is 15 seconds maximum. That's restrictive for tutorials or longer content, but functional for social clips, greetings, or short ads. Does this duration work for most use cases? I feel its limiting for me.  \n  \nI need tools that generate video from text or images without requiring API access or coding, work in China, support Chinese prompts with a Chinese interface, and remain free or low cost. Open source options are fine if setup is straightforward.  \n  \nWhat are you using for quick video content creation through chat interfaces? Specifically interested in tools that maintain reasonable quality with generation times under a few minutes.  \n  \nFor short form content, Qwen handles the basics without major issues.  \n  \n",

Now work often emerges from a collaboration between human judgment and AI and it raises a tricky question: should employees disclose when AI contributed? Its not just policy its about trust. Claiming AI helped might make people doubt your originality, while hiding it can make them doubt your integrity. The real shift is toward context over confession: instead of asking Did you use AI? the more meaningful question becomes How did you use it? Work will be judged by insight and thoughtful execution, not by whether a machine played a role. Understanding when not to use AI will become just as valuable as knowing how to use it. If you want to explore this balance in your team or workflow, I’m happy to guide you and offer free consultation.",

They were built by many people over time, relied on undocumented judgment, copy-pasted ideas, and handoffs no one could fully explain later. We just didn’t have tooling to surface that.\n\nWhat LLMs make possible (when used correctly) isn’t hiding work — it’s *explicitly naming it*. They can help systems explain what exists, what ran, what assumptions were made, and where responsibility actually sits.\n\nThe problem I see in practice is teams dropping LLMs into existing workflows without structure. The system starts sounding confident without being accountable. That’s not AI replacing authorship — it’s automation without instrumentation.\n\nUsed properly, AI should make authorship clearer, not murkier. For example, an ITSM workflow should be able to deterministically report what a human operator did over a day, week, or year — not “AI-generated summaries,” but explicit, auditable records of real work, gaps, and constraints.\n\nAt that point, disclosure becomes less about confession (“did you use AI?”) and more about capability: *can the system explain itself in black and white?*",

      "text": "Agentic AI isn’t just LLMs + tools + a loop. That’s the misconception behind most flashy demos you see. Real production-grade Agentic AI is a full system design problem, not a single model decision. The key insight? You don’t simply call an agent you orchestrate planning, execution, memory, tools and validation. Agents without planners drift, agents without memory repeat themselves and agents without feedback loops hallucinate with confidence. Without proper orchestration, they won’t scale. The tricky part isn’t choosing the latest LLM or framework. Its designing how the system thinks: task decomposition, state and memory management, tool reliability, autonomy versus control and robust feedback loops with validation and recovery. In production a real Agentic AI pipeline looks like this: Client → Orchestration → Planning → Agents → Tools → Memory → Validation → Observability and feedback loops are everywhere. Models reason, but systems decide. If you’re building Agentic AI today stop thinking like a prompt engineer. Start thinking like a systems architect. That’s where success or failure really lives.",

The second you try to run them unsupervised on real tasks with real data, everything falls apart.\n\nThe memory thing is huge. I've watched agents confidently repeat the same failed approach three times in a row because they have no sense of \"I already tried this and it didn't work.\" And the planning piece... getting an LLM to actually break down a complex task into reasonable steps instead of just yolo-ing the whole thing is way harder than the tutorials make it look.\n\nBut I'd push back slightly on the \"think like a systems architect\" framing. In my experience the failure mode isn't usually architecture... it's that people don't understand the actual task well enough to know what the system even needs to do.\n\nLike, you can design the most elegant orchestration layer with perfect memory management and validation loops, but if you don't deeply understand the messy reality of the problem you're solving, you're just building a really well-engineered thing that doesn't work.\n\nThe boring advice is to get one narrow task working reliably end-to-end before you start thinking about orchestration patterns. Most agent projects I've seen fail because they went wayyyyy too wide before they went deep.\n\nBut yeah... \"LLM + tools + loop = agent\" is definitely the misleading part of most demos.

The failure mode is rarely the model, it is unclear ownership of state, weak recovery paths, and no agreement on what “done” or “correct” actually means. Once agents touch real workflows, validation and observability stop being optional and start being the product.\n\nI also like the point about autonomy versus control. Most orgs underestimate how much governance logic they already have baked into processes, and then wonder why agents either stall or go rogue. Thinking like a systems architect is really about deciding where judgment is allowed and where it is constrained.",

The model often does exactly what it was asked to do, just in a context that should have stopped or escalated earlier.\n\nThat’s why a lot of agent demos look fine under supervision and fall apart once they run unattended. The system has no memory of failed attempts, no guardrails around execution, and no clean way to intervene when something goes off the happy path.\n\nGetting one narrow workflow to run reliably end to end usually teaches you more than any high level orchestration pattern.",

But the thing is, I want to be more capable, but I have no where to sart.   \n  \nI want to go deeper into automation, I want to help other departments with it as well, I want my colleagues to have less things to do so they live happier, less stressful lives.\n\nI told my superior that I would like to get some sort of course to learn more about all this and they said \"Hell yeah\" if I can just show them which one I want they will fund it and I've been looking for one to send them for around a month now but I just don't know if it even makes any sense.\n\nI absolutely love the process of automating that I already do and I want to be better, more useful cause as it is right now, I can basically just do 1 thing and fix it if it's broken but I know I can do more if I just had some direction.\n\nIf you guys got any recommendations of where I should start, or some place where to learn, how to get experience so I can actually start doing things here that would be amazing.",

For learning, I would go deeper into Power Platform first if you are already there, especially Power Automate and proper error handling, logging, and versioning. Parallel to that, learning basic SQL and API concepts will unlock far more automation than any single course. Once you are solid there, tools like n8n or Make make more sense because you will understand when to use them and when not to.

Going deeper into workflow automation (n8n / Make / Power Automate) plus basic API concepts will take you far. Courses help, but rebuilding one full process end-to-end is where the real learning happens.",

Useful, yes. Agents, not really.\n\nThe difference shows up the moment something unexpected happens. Real agents need to detect failure, reassess, and choose a different path instead of silently breaking or looping. That also means the environment matters a lot. When agents have to interact with real systems, running them in something predictable like hyperbrowser helps remove execution noise so you can actually tell whether the agent logic is adapting or just getting lucky.\n\nUntil systems can handle failure gracefully and explain why they chose the next action, most “AI automation” will stay closer to task runners than true agents.",

When prompts are vague, things fall apart quickly.\n\nIt made me wonder if the problem isn’t AI code itself, but how people use it.\n\nFor those who’ve worked with AI-generated code beyond demos, how has it held up over time?

If you don’t, it will happily generate something that “works” and quietly bakes in edge case bugs.\n\nOver time, the debt comes from inconsistency. Different styles, different patterns, no shared conventions. What actually helped was forcing the same gates as human PRs, tests, types, formatting, and a reviewer who understands the domain.

What helps me in my workflow is using Kilo Code's different modes for development (coding, architecture, debug). Architecture mode helps with structural layout first, which keeps things cleaner from the start. Then code mode for implementation, and debug mode for tracking down issues. Pairing that with manual review has kept our codebase maintainable.\n\nWe work closely with the Kilo Code team on some mutual projects, but this approach has worked well for us so far. :)",

      "text": "About six months ago I was trying to make my workflow easier and jumped into the automation rabbit hole instead. Zapier connecting to notion connecting to calendly connecting to stripe. Watched probably 20 hours of youtube tutorials lol really committed to making this work.\n\n\n\nThe reality is I'm now troubleshooting failed zaps multiple times a week. Something breaks, I have to log in and figure out which connection failed, reconnect it, test it, hope it works. My calendly integration just stopped working for three days before I even noticed, lost who knows how many potential bookings.\n\n\n\nBefore all this I just answered my phone and wrote things down. Was it elegant? No. Did it work? Yeah pretty much always. Now I have this complex web of automations that's supposed to save me time but I feel like I'm maintaining a house of cards.\n\n\n\nI fought with this for a long time but eventually gave up on the custom workflow approach and switched to bizzen since it's just one tool. I still feel a bit defeated for not being able to manage with my own automation. Like I always prefer to custom everything I can but in this case it seems it didn’t make sense\n\n\n\nI think maybe the problem is trying to force general automation tools into specific business workflows. Curious what other people's experience has been, does custom automation ever stabilize or is purpose built software just the better move?",

General automation tools work best when they are enforcing a very stable, very boring core workflow. When they are used to replace unclear process, they turn into a fragile chain that constantly needs babysitting.\n\nA good litmus test is this: if the business cannot explain the workflow on a whiteboard without Zapier, it will not be stable with Zapier. Custom automation can work long term, but only after the inputs, ownership, and failure modes are deliberately simplified. Otherwise, purpose built software feels better because it hides that complexity instead of exposing it.",

General-purpose automation tools like Zapier are powerful, but they shift the role of “work” from doing the task to maintaining the system. at a certain level of complexity, you didn’t eliminate effort, you just turned yourself into an unpaid reliability engineer.  custom automations can stabilize, but only under a few conditions that most solo operators and small teams don’t realistically have: clearly defined inputs, low variability, limited edge cases, strong error handling, monitoring, and someone accountable for upkeep. Without those, every new connection increases failure surface area. Calendar tools change APIs, auth tokens expire, webhooks silently fail, and Zapier doesn’t protect you from that, it just abstracts it until it breaks.the key insight you landed on forcing general automation tools into specific workflows is exactly right. Zapier is great for stitching together simple, non-critical actions. it’s terrible for mission-critical workflows like lead intake, booking, or revenue events where silent failure costs real money. Purpose-built software wins there because reliability, retries, and edge cases are part of the product, not your responsibility.",

It's that **automation tools are asked to execute a process that only exists in your head as intuition and muscle memory.**\n\nYou built a web of *connections* between tools, but you didn't first extract the *decision logic* that governs those connections. When Calendly fires, what are the 3 criteria you mentally check before a booking is 'valid'? That's your operational DNA. Without it codified, any automation is just guessing and will break on edge cases.\n\nThis is why founders who try to delegate to a human hire face the same 'house of cards' feeling. You're handing them a list of tasks (or Zaps) without the embedded judgment you apply subconsciously.\n\n**The step before automation (or hiring) is always the same: Forensic Extraction.** You must audit your own workweek not for *what* you do, but for the invisible rules, quality gates, and 'if-then' decisions that make your service work. That becomes your **Protocol**—a system stable enough for a human to run or for targeted automation to execute.\n\nWhat you're feeling isn't defeat. It's the signal that you've outgrown the 'just wire tools together' phase. The next skill to learn is how to mine your own genius out of your daily work.",

So I'm wanting to help small businesses streamline their operations and automate their tech stack (though I understand every business is different and automation is just a set of tools).\n\nI've started with Make, though am aware of n8n and the capabilities. Also I'm working my way through an Agentic workflows course from Nick Saraev.\n\nMy questions:\n\n* Have you made a change into this field, and where did you come from?\n* Have you gone out alone, how did you get your first clients?\n* How have you found this experience, what are your pain points if any?\n* What learning free/low cost resources have you used to upskill?\n\n  \nThanks! 🤓",

Small businesses feel the damage fast when something silently breaks and customers start looping or spamming. If you can frame your work around reducing repeat issues and making failures visible, not just saving time, you will stand out.\n\nOn the learning side, real exposure to messy workflows taught me more than any course.

The biggest pain point I see people hit is overbuilding before they really understand how the business runs day to day.

If you keep anchoring your work to reducing friction so people can focus on what they do best, you will stay aligned with real value rather than chasing complexity for its own sake.",

The automation piece kind of happened naturally when we started building AI solutions for restaurants and realized how much manual work people were doing that could be automated.\n\nGetting first clients is rough, not gonna lie. For us it was a lot of cold outreach and showing up where our customers were. Local business owners are usually pretty receptive if you can show them something tangible quickly. I'd say focus on one specific problem they have rather than trying to automate everything at once. Also check out Replit for quick prototyping - way easier than setting up a whole dev environment when you're just testing ideas.",

If it’s bursty or experimental, spinning up GPU instances on demand makes sense so you are not paying to keep them warm. If it’s steady volume, a long lived instance with autoscaling around it is usually simpler to reason about.\n\nWhat mattered for us was how easy it was to monitor failures and restart jobs, not raw GPU flexibility. OCR pipelines tend to fail quietly when something changes upstream. Whatever you pick, make sure logs and retries are boring and predictable, otherwise the model choice won’t matter much.",

Tools like Vitara lean heavily into this approach, where prompts drive most of the development.\n\nOn one hand, this feels like a natural evolution. We already autocomplete, scaffold, and generate boilerplate. On the other hand, calling it “vibe coding” makes it sound more abstract than it really is.\n\nWhat I’m curious about is whether this approach actually changes how people build software long-term, or if it’s mostly useful for prototyping and quick experiments.\n\nDoes it improve clarity and speed, or does it hide complexity until it becomes a problem later?\n\nWould love to hear from people who’ve actually tried working this way for more than a weekend project.",

Record the workflow once: Login → Navigate to company page → Capture data points. Run on schedule (daily/weekly). Store results in spreadsheet or database. Get alerts only when changes occur (new posts, follower spikes, etc.).\n\nWhy this approach holds up: No API rate limits. Works on platforms without APIs (LinkedIn, Indeed). Mimics human behavior. No account flags. Runs with realistic delays between actions.\n\nPlatform-friendly setup: Use your own logged-in session (not scraping public pages). Keep frequency reasonable (once/day max per target). Respect robots.txt for public pages. No parallel requests to same domain.\n\nMy stack: I use browser automation (Playwright-based) that records workflows visually, then replays them. Works for checking competitor dashboards, tracking pricing changes, monitoring LinkedIn activity, etc.\n\nDisclosure: I built EasyFlow for exactly this. No-code browser automation for recurring checks. Records your clicks once, replays on schedule.\n\nKey principle: if your automation looks exactly like how you'd do it manually, platforms don't care. It's when you scale to thousands of requests/hour that rules break.\n\nWhat platforms are you tracking specifically? Happy to share more detailed setup if helpful.",

It's not scraping data per se, just visual snapshots I can compare over time to spot changes in messaging, employee count, recent posts, etc.   \nThe key is keeping it lightweight - I'm not trying to extract follower lists or detailed analytics, just getting that \"pulse check\" visibility you mentioned. For broader market monitoring, I combine this with Google Alerts for company mentions and RSS feeds from industry publications.   \nThe automation runs headless on a VPS with rotating IP addresses to stay under the radar. Been running for about 8 months now without issues. I also built in random delays between actions to make it look more human.   \nOne thing I learned the hard way - start simple. My first attempt tried to do everything (social media, news, job postings) and became a maintenance nightmare. Now I focus on just 2-3 key signals per competitor and it's much more sustainable.   \nThe visual timeline approach has been surprisingly useful too.

          "text": "For sure, these are some of the best video generators available online. However, I do believe that an AI creative suite like ImagineArt is also a great AI video tool. You get to access and try all these AI video generators such as Veo, Kling, Hailuo, Sora, and Runway at the same place and singular cost. It has a built-in AI video editor and a dedicated lip-sync studio to refine AV synchronization. Its video extend feature lets you create longer videos, along with motion control features. You can generate stylized visuals content, cinematic movies, talking head videos (with multi-image references), and social media content.",

          "text": "What shows up repeatedly when teams try these is that the tooling choice matters less than where the output lands in the workflow. A lot of generators look impressive in isolation, but the failure mode tends to be consistency, revision loops, and handoff once videos need to be updated or scaled. The list makes that visible, some are optimized for creative exploration, others for repeatable business use. The metric people fixate on is visual quality, but the friction usually comes later when stakeholders ask for small changes or ongoing cadence. I have found it more useful to evaluate how easy it is to iterate and keep outputs aligned over time than how good the first render looks. Curious how many folks here have gotten past pilots and into steady production with any of these.",
