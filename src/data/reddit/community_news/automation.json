The key thing was the placement of the device where we had to walk past it plus reminders animate more intensely closer to the actual target time. Fully developed with an hour with Claude Code.",

It pulls data from a few internal tools, checks external signals, compares everything against rules, and then decides whether to alert, escalate, or do nothing. There’s reasoning involved, but it’s bounded.\n\nWhat made it possible was not trying to automate judgment end to end. The agent handles gathering context, validating numbers, and preparing recommendations. Humans only step in when something crosses a threshold. When parts of that flow needed to interact with real web apps instead of clean APIs, running it in a stable environment like hyperbrowser kept the whole thing from falling apart.\n\nAnything more complex than that usually needs checkpoints. Fully autonomous complex tasks still break too easily once the data gets messy.",

That includes prioritizing work, flagging edge cases, routing tasks to the right person/system, and looping humans back in only when confidence drops.\n\nThe hard part isn’t the automation itself. It’s:\n\n* handling incomplete or contradictory inputs\n* knowing when *not* to automate\n* and building feedback loops so the system gets better over time instead of silently failing\n\nSimple automations save time. Complex ones replace cognitive load. That’s where AI actually starts to feel useful.",

Only process the delta.\n\n- Keep the outputs short.\n  “One-line summary + next action + confidence” is way cheaper than full rewrites.\n\nBallpark: if you’re processing ~50–200 relevant emails/day with batching + filtering, it’s usually manageable.

I built a Clay table a while back that “just worked” and then a tiny upstream tweak (field rename, enrichment provider changing output, rate limit behavior) would make the downstream logic act weird without fully failing. It’s the worst kind of broken because it keeps running, just slightly wrong.\n\nWhat helped me keep it sane over time:\n\n* Version it like code. Duplicate the table/workflow before any change, label it v1, v2, etc. If something goes sideways you can diff the inputs and outputs fast.\n* Add “contract checks” inside the workflow. I keep a couple lightweight columns that validate assumptions (required fields present, formats match, confidence thresholds, “did this enrichment return null when it used to be filled”). If a check fails, route rows to a “quarantine” view instead of letting them flow through.\n* Canary runs. I test changes on a small slice of rows or a saved sample list, then widen. You catch the “retry ran twice” type stuff early.\n* Log intent, not just execution. I started writing one sentence notes right in the table or in a linked doc: “This step exists because X breaks when Y changes.” Future me forgets why I chose a weird conditional.\n* Watch for slow drift. Pick 2–3 metrics you can eyeball weekly (fill rate for key fields, % rows quarantined, average time per row, % retries). If those move, something upstream changed.\n\nIf you’re using Clay for this, do you have a “quarantine” path today, or does every row always continue no matter what? And what’s the most fragile dependency, a specific data source, an API, or your own conditional logic?",

Gives a high level overview of the purpose of the workflow to be tested. Lists pre-requiste steps, lists resources used to run the test. Pretty much tells a newcomer upon the test what it would take to run it themselves. \n\n\\-Do you test changes in isolation before pushing them live?\n\nYes, yes, over and over again, yes. \n\n\\-How do you notice slow degradation before something actually fails?\n\nFor us, we work in a dev environment. The best thing to describe \"slow degradation\" would be the small UI updates we get over time, that may cause the automation to change enough over time, it may increase the odds of not passing over time. \n\n=======\n\nPiece of advice - at times, I am better off to scrap it and rebuild it than to try to engineer it back into working.

The constraints are: it needs to be maintainable by a small team, training cost matters, and I don’t want the solution to collapse the moment the UI shifts slightly.\n\nI’m looking at a few categories and trying to understand what actually holds up in practice:\n\n* Workflow automation: n8n / Make (great when integrations exist, but we hit UI-only gaps)\n* RPA suites: RPA suites: UiPath, Power Automate (good for “press the UI” flows, but I’m worried about long-term maintenance)\n* Web automation: Playwright/Cypress (works when it’s truly web + stable DOM)\n* Visual/UI-level automation: Eggplant, AskUI (for the parts that don’t expose reliable selectors/control trees)\n\nFor fellow peers who shipped this kind of automation what stack ended up being maintainable a year or two later? What did you try and abandon because maintenance overhead killed it? I’m quite interested in approaches that work for native UIs (HMI/POS/desktop), Appreciate any input!",

Even “AI-driven” agents still fail in edge cases like partial renders, stale auth state, or silent UI regressions. Practically, the most resilient approach I’ve seen is: treat Make/n8n as the orchestration + state layer, keep UI automation narrowly scoped and idempotent, and design clear failure detection + recovery paths instead of trying to make UI automation bulletproof.\n\nIf you go in assuming UI automation *will* break and design for containment rather than perfection, it’s survivable. If not, it becomes the thing you’re constantly babysitting.",

AI doesn’t guess. If inputs aren’t defined, the workflow breaks, completely.\n\n2 - Confusing complex workflows with smart systems:\nA complicated n8n canvas doesn’t mean value. Simple, steady workflows solve real problems and scale better than flashy, over-engineered ones.\n\n3- Skipping process mapping:\nIf the underlying process is broken, automation only makes it fail faster. You must understand handoffs, bottlenecks, and failure points before touching n8n.\n\n4: Ignoring company-specific data and logic:\nAI agents, chatbots, and automations only work when trained on what the business actually does services, rules, data access, and allowed actions. Generic logic never scales.\n\n5 Chasing hype instead of ROI:\nAutomation isn’t about showing cool workflows. It’s about reducing manual work, increasing accuracy, and delivering measurable outcomes. If there’s no ROI, the automation is useless.\n\nHere’s the real lesson:\n\nn8n is not the product.\nAutomation is not the skill.\nProblem-solving and system design are.",

If the manual process is a mess, automating it just creates a faster mess. You gotta fix the process first, then automate.\n\nMost people selling automation have never worked in the industries they're targeting. They don't know the actual pain points or edge cases.

      "text": "I'm in China for a few months and needed video generation tools that work here without VPNs or overseas accounts. Found about Qwen's chatbot from a colleague and noticed they offer free video generation, which seemed unusual since most platforms gate this behind premium tiers.  \n  \nI tested it expecting poor results. Uploaded a static image and generated a 5 second clip. The output was decent. Transitions were smooth, no stuttering, and motion looked natural. Resolution isn't 4K but works fine for TikTok, WeChat Moments, or product demos. Processing took around 12 seconds, which is reasonable.  \n  \nWhat caught my attention is that other chatbot platforms don't offer video creation without payment. Image generation is becoming common in free tiers, but video usually requires credits or subscriptions. ERNIE Bot and iFlytek Spark don't offer this to free users from what I can tell.  \n  \nThe limitation is 15 seconds maximum. That's restrictive for tutorials or longer content, but functional for social clips, greetings, or short ads. Does this duration work for most use cases? I feel its limiting for me.  \n  \nI need tools that generate video from text or images without requiring API access or coding, work in China, support Chinese prompts with a Chinese interface, and remain free or low cost. Open source options are fine if setup is straightforward.  \n  \nWhat are you using for quick video content creation through chat interfaces? Specifically interested in tools that maintain reasonable quality with generation times under a few minutes.  \n  \nFor short form content, Qwen handles the basics without major issues.  \n  \n",

Hard caps like 15 seconds are fine for social clips, but they fall apart fast for internal workflows or customer facing content. We ran into this with similar tools where quality was acceptable, but output varied a lot under load or during busy hours. If you are using it casually, it works. If you need it in a process, the lack of guarantees and controls becomes the bottleneck pretty quickly.",

Review weekly and organize into Notion or whatever.\n\nOnce that habit sticks, then add the AI layer.

Real agents need to detect failure, reassess, and choose a different path instead of silently breaking or looping. That also means the environment matters a lot. When agents have to interact with real systems, running them in something predictable like hyperbrowser helps remove execution noise so you can actually tell whether the agent logic is adapting or just getting lucky.\n\nUntil systems can handle failure gracefully and explain why they chose the next action, most “AI automation” will stay closer to task runners than true agents.",

      "text": "I’ve spent the last month watching agents fall apart on complex tasks. They start well lose context halfway through and collapse before finishing. The model isn’t the issue. The missing piece is architecture. What actually fixes this is an agent harness: a control layer that plans work, breaks it into tasks, tracks state, stores outputs and recovers from errors. The agent does the thinking, but the harness manages execution. Once you add persistence, everything changes. Tasks are logged, outputs are saved, progress is visible and failures don’t force a restart. You pause inspect and resume. I built this pattern in n8n for long-running research workflows: parallel data collection, sequential synthesis and incremental writing. The agent can run for hours or days because the system remembers what its doing. Most tools today are still single-shot generators. That’s fine for quick content. It doesn’t work for real projects. The future of agents isn’t smarter models. Its better scaffolding. If you want agents to do real work, build the harness first.",

So I'm wanting to help small businesses streamline their operations and automate their tech stack (though I understand every business is different and automation is just a set of tools).\n\nI've started with Make, though am aware of n8n and the capabilities. Also I'm working my way through an Agentic workflows course from Nick Saraev.\n\nMy questions:\n\n* Have you made a change into this field, and where did you come from?\n* Have you gone out alone, how did you get your first clients?\n* How have you found this experience, what are your pain points if any?\n* What learning free/low cost resources have you used to upskill?\n\n  \nThanks! 🤓",

The thing I would flag early is that automation work looks clean in isolation, but the pain shows up in the exceptions and ownership gaps. That is where your CS background actually matters.\n\nThe biggest pitfall I have seen is building clever flows without clear failure states, monitoring, or a human handoff. Small businesses feel the damage fast when something silently breaks and customers start looping or spamming. If you can frame your work around reducing repeat issues and making failures visible, not just saving time, you will stand out.\n\nOn the learning side, real exposure to messy workflows taught me more than any course. Pick one process, define what success looks like, and decide who owns it when it goes wrong. If you can answer those questions confidently, you are already thinking like an ops person rather than a tool builder.",

A lot of strong CS folks are already doing ops and automation work without the title, especially when they are the ones cleaning up workflows after things break for customers. What I’ve seen work is starting very problem-first with small businesses, not “I automate stacks” but “I reduce handoffs, repeats, and manual fixes that frustrate customers and teams.” Going solo can work, but the hardest part early on is scoping and expectation setting, because automation that looks simple can create edge cases fast. The biggest pain point I see people hit is overbuilding before they really understand how the business runs day to day.

That experience taught me that you have to iterate constantly until the solution runs problem-free to get true user adoption. That was my 'eureka moment' a few months back while consulting with a local Venezuelan restaurant.\n\nI realized I didn't need to build a massive tech stack for them. I just needed to iterate on a few key friction points so they could focus on cooking. My plan is to start small to earn trust and offer a structured hand-off so they feel confident running it.",

The fact that you learned through iteration and user adoption, not tooling, is the part that actually transfers across businesses. The Google Sheets phase teaches you more about real workflows than most polished stacks ever will.\n\nStarting small and earning trust is exactly what keeps automation from becoming shelfware or creating new problems later. The handoff piece you mentioned is also underrated. When people feel ownership instead of dependency, adoption sticks and escalations drop. If you keep anchoring your work to reducing friction so people can focus on what they do best, you will stay aligned with real value rather than chasing complexity for its own sake.",

The automation piece kind of happened naturally when we started building AI solutions for restaurants and realized how much manual work people were doing that could be automated.\n\nGetting first clients is rough, not gonna lie. For us it was a lot of cold outreach and showing up where our customers were. Local business owners are usually pretty receptive if you can show them something tangible quickly. I'd say focus on one specific problem they have rather than trying to automate everything at once. Also check out Replit for quick prototyping - way easier than setting up a whole dev environment when you're just testing ideas.",

Scrapes my niche daily and gives me the highest viral hooks of the day\n\n2. Lets me automate the videos fast (no-code + free to run for the first couple months depending on credit usage)\n\nBecause of that, my videos basically always pick up momentum, and this system has gotten multiple accounts monetized across different platforms in just a few weeks (now at around $350 per week).\n\nI'm scaling it now and adding more to the workflow as I go.\n\nIf anyone has any questions on how the setup works or how to start testing it, feel free to hit me up.

Record the workflow once: Login → Navigate to company page → Capture data points. Run on schedule (daily/weekly). Store results in spreadsheet or database. Get alerts only when changes occur (new posts, follower spikes, etc.).\n\nWhy this approach holds up: No API rate limits. Works on platforms without APIs (LinkedIn, Indeed). Mimics human behavior. No account flags. Runs with realistic delays between actions.\n\nPlatform-friendly setup: Use your own logged-in session (not scraping public pages). Keep frequency reasonable (once/day max per target). Respect robots.txt for public pages. No parallel requests to same domain.\n\nMy stack: I use browser automation (Playwright-based) that records workflows visually, then replays them. Works for checking competitor dashboards, tracking pricing changes, monitoring LinkedIn activity, etc.\n\nDisclosure: I built EasyFlow for exactly this. No-code browser automation for recurring checks. Records your clicks once, replays on schedule.\n\nKey principle: if your automation looks exactly like how you'd do it manually, platforms don't care. It's when you scale to thousands of requests/hour that rules break.\n\nWhat platforms are you tracking specifically? Happy to share more detailed setup if helpful.",

For LinkedIn specifically, I set up browser automation using Playwright to capture screenshots of competitor company pages on a schedule (weekly works well). It's not scraping data per se, just visual snapshots I can compare over time to spot changes in messaging, employee count, recent posts, etc.   \nThe key is keeping it lightweight - I'm not trying to extract follower lists or detailed analytics, just getting that \"pulse check\" visibility you mentioned. For broader market monitoring, I combine this with Google Alerts for company mentions and RSS feeds from industry publications.   \nThe automation runs headless on a VPS with rotating IP addresses to stay under the radar. Been running for about 8 months now without issues. I also built in random delays between actions to make it look more human.   \nOne thing I learned the hard way - start simple. My first attempt tried to do everything (social media, news, job postings) and became a maintenance nightmare. Now I focus on just 2-3 key signals per competitor and it's much more sustainable.   \nThe visual timeline approach has been surprisingly useful too. Sometimes you spot trends in competitor positioning that you'd miss just reading individual posts.",

Missed calls, delayed estimates, manual reminders these small inefficiencies quietly kill productivity. Most people start by exploring flashy tools and frameworks, but that’s putting the cart before the horse. The real strategy is to identify a single high-impact workflow and focus there. Once you know the workflow, define how the agent should act, when a human needs to step in and which tools it will connect to. Launch the agent, monitor its performance, refine the rules and then replicate that success across other workflows. Start simple, prove value and scale gradually. One well-built agent that actually works is far more powerful than dozens that barely function.

Automation helped when it removed waiting or repetition, but hurt when it trapped customers in a loop.

Most onboarding pain comes from edge cases, approvals, and timing, not the happy path. If you document the trigger, required attributes, exceptions, and who owns failures, the automation almost designs itself. Also worth thinking about what should stay manual, especially access tied to role ambiguity or compliance. Automating the wrong assumptions just creates faster messes.",

ChatGPT is great at sketching quick Python scripts, although it sometimes explains every line like I have never seen a loop before. Claude feels better at catching logic issues, but every now and then it turns a simple cleaning step into a mini framework.\n\nThe part that trips me up most is not really the code itself, it is wiring everything together and then explaining the flow to other people on calls. I started recording short loom videos of my pipelines and walking through them out loud, then running the code pieces through a mix of helpers. Python in VS Code does the actual lifting, I poke GPT or Claude when I am stuck on a transformation, and I use a couple of mock interview style tools like Beyz coding assistant when I want to practise talking through what the automation actually does.\n\nWhat I keep running into is that most tools go after huge problems, while my biggest headache is still that small messy gap between scripts, spreadsheets and humans.

The tech can be solid, but if people can’t follow what’s happening or trust the output, it creates friction instead of speed. We saw similar issues when internal teams couldn’t explain automated decisions clearly on calls, even when the logic was sound. What helped wasn’t another big AI layer, it was lightweight things like consistent naming, simple run logs, and short human-readable summaries of what changed and why. Slightly boring, but it reduced back and forth and made handoffs calmer. Curious if anyone else has found small tools or habits that made automation easier to explain, not just easier to run.",

I've been there too many times - you build something that works perfectly in isolation but then you have to explain it to a finance team or get data from 5 different systems that don't talk to each other. The \"boring\" connective tissue is usually what makes or breaks whether automation actually gets adopted.\n\nFor that messy middle ground, I'd suggest looking at tools like Zapier or Make for the basic plumbing between systems, even though they're not sexy. For the human explanation part, something like Notion or even just well-structured markdown docs with screenshots can be lifesavers when you need to hand off processes. At Starter Stack AI we ended up building our own document processing workflows because off-the-shelf tools either did too much or too little, but honestly the biggest wins came from just making sure every automation step had a simple explanation that non-technical people could follow. Sometimes the most valuable tool is just a shared folder with clear naming conventions and a 2-page \"how this works\" doc.",

      "text": "Lovable is cool, but sometimes it’s a bit overkill, or you just don’t want to mess with a React-style codebase when you just want a tool that works.  This month I’m going down the rabbit hole of AI builders, trying to find tools that are actually \"no-code\" friendly and don't require a CS degree to deploy. Here’s my personal list:\n\n1\\. **Super Intern**: My top pick for anything quick & social\n\nIt’s basically an agent builder that lives where people actually talk (Discord, Telegram, etc.). I used it to ship a self-evolving spam detector for my server in about 15 minutes. It’s the fastest \"idea-to-sharing\" loop I’ve seen because your \"app\" is just a bot in your group chat. \n\n2\\. **Gumloop** : The \"LEGO\" of AI automations\n\nIt’s like Zapier but actually smart. I use it when I need to scrape a site, summarize it, and then pipe that data into a specific workflow. It’s node-based, so you can see exactly where the data is going.\n\n**Best for:** Complex backend workflows and data scraping.\n\n3\\. **Mocha AI** : The \"0-to-1\" speed king\n\nThis is what I wish Lovable felt like for total beginners. You describe the app, and it just pops out a very clean, functional web UI. It’s less about \"coding\" and more about \"intent.\" Perfect if you need a quick dashboard or a internal tool for your team that looks professional without any CSS tweaking.\n\n4\\. **Youware:** The \"Viral App\" builder.\n\nMobile-first. It’s great for creating apps that use multiple LLMs (Gemini, GPT, etc.) in one place. Very user-friendly if you want that \"app store\" feel without actually going through the app store hassle.\n\nAre we still overpaying for Lovable or have you guys found something even better?",

It's designed for that exact friction you mentioned: describe what you need, and the agent handles planning and connecting steps without technical setup.\n\nThe sweet spot is how it handles integrations—800+ integrations means you can wire together most APIs without touching code. It's node-based like Gumloop but leans harder into the \"describe outcome, get workflow\" angle. Solid for folks who want AI automation for everyone on their team, not just technical folks.

I like running one render engine (Cloudinary or Bannerbear, even something homegrown) and keeping the rest as data plumbing. DreamFactory just helps expose the content/metadata from different databases as clean APIs so the renderer gets predictable inputs. Biggest win has been adding cheap validation (character counts, safe areas, brand colors) before anything hits the queue, then a fast human skim only on new or high-risk variants.",

Without that clarity, reps ignore the AI or work around it.\n\nAI sales agents are leverage, not leadership. They amplify whatever system they are dropped into.\n\nIf a team wants fewer deals falling through the cracks, the question is not “which AI agent” but “where does a deal actually die today.”",

But that does not matter to me as long as I get paid. 5 L is obviously exploitation so I said 10(which is also way too less) but that’s a lot of money to keep us motivated with the offer. Around a week later after I gave the counter offer they sent me a mail saying they found someone who’s doing it for 3. That is absolutely insane exploitation.

It works for a week and then breaks or sends something embarrassing.  \n  \nThe most sustainable way I have found is a hybrid approach. I automate the profile visits and the initial connection request, but once they accept, I handle the conversation manually. If you try to automate the whole DM sequence, you will spend more time fixing broken flows than you would just typing the messages.  \n  \nThe real unlock is moving them off LinkedIn entirely. Use LinkedIn to find them, but send the actual pitch via email where automation is stable and you don't have to worry about account bans.  \n  \nI use LinkedIn email finder tool to make that switch. It sits on the profile and pulls the verified work email. It is helpful here because it lets you take the conversation off the \"babysitting\" platform and into your email tools where you can actually scale things safely.",

One thing I’d challenge early is whether Airtable and ClickUp need deep integration at all.

Airtable is great as an approval and coordination layer, but I’m cautious when it’s treated as a ledger.

Every painful observation about your inbox. Every fake ad for \"Scope Creep Insurance.\" The copy is handcrafted. Sonny needed something to say - that part doesn't automate.\n\n\\- I assemble everything by hand, I make it realistic and authentic\n\nThe AI is the instrument. The writing is mine.\n\n3-hour episodes. New one every day. Designed to fade into the background until Sonny says something that makes you pause and think \"...okay that one hurt.\"\n\nThrow it on during your next build session.

      "text": "I just conjured a spellbinding automation for a product reviewer in Porto who was drowning in endless affiliate posts. Pulling specs from Google Sheets, crafting intros and descriptions with AI magic, scraping images, building sitemaps, and publishing polished reviews to WordPress was stealing hours from actual testing. So I created Ink, an automation that flows like enchanted quill across parchment, turning raw product data into captivating, Search engine optimisation rich blog posts that publish themselves while the reviewer sips port wine.\n\nInk uses Make as the master alchemist and WordPress as the eternal scroll. It’s clever, tireless, and runs with literary grace. Here’s how Ink writes:\n\n1. New product rows hit Google Sheets → Ink grabs keywords, styles, and prompts, then summons AI to weave intros, quotes, and full descriptions.\n2. It hunts perfect images, checks them, parses text, builds affiliate links, and generates XML sitemaps for search engines.\n3. Tools aggregate details, compose narratives, and format markdown → everything lands flawlessly in WordPress as a ready-to-rank post.\n4. Iterators loop through batches, handling dozens at once without missing a comma or affiliate tag.\n5. The reviewer wakes to one Slack whisper: “Tonight Ink penned 18 reviews, uploaded 72 images, sitemap updated, traffic waiting. Your next tasting is free.”\n\nThis setup is pure Porto alchemy for affiliate bloggers, review sites, or any content creator scaling with AI. It turns mechanical drudgery into effortless creation and lets the human focus on what machines can’t: taste, opinion, and soul.\n\nHappy automating, and may your posts always enchant.",

      "text": "Everyone talks about building AI agents, but most people start in the wrong place. They jump straight into agent mode when a simple automation or search-based system would solve the problem more efficiently. The truth is not every task needs intelligence; some just need logic. Start by asking yourself whether the problem is structured and repetitive. If it is automation handles it cleanly without the overhead of agents. If the work involves extracting answers from documents or large datasets, tools like RAG or search pipelines are the smarter starting point. Sometimes the solution already exists in a SaaS agent buying can save months of work. When the task requires a single role to handle it, a single-agent system suffices, but if responsibilities are split, multi-agent orchestration becomes relevant. Skipping this thinking leads to fragile systems, ballooning costs and painful maintenance, while following it results in faster builds, scalable architectures and reliable outcomes. The key takeaway: AI agents aren’t about the newest shiny tools they’re about applying the right level of intelligence to the problem at hand. Logic first. Search second. Agents last.",

      "text": "Healthcare is already using AI for diagnosis, imaging and drug discovery, but the real shift will come from AI agents that can act, not just analyze. Unlike today’s tools that answer questions or flag issues, agentic AI can connect data across systems, make decisions and trigger actions with minimal human input such as reviewing scans alongside patient history, generating clinical summaries, scheduling follow-ups and monitoring recovery remotely. This matters because healthcare faces staff shortages, aging populations, rising costs and an urgent push toward preventive care. AI agents could ease administrative overload, improve triage accuracy support clinical decisions, manage parts of trials, and enable more patients to be treated safely at home. At the same time, greater autonomy introduces serious risks around data security, accountability, bias and error, making human oversight essential. If these challenges are addressed responsibly, AI agents could shift healthcare from reactive treatment to proactive, personalized care freeing clinicians to focus less on paperwork and more on outcomes, while expanding access and efficiency across the system.",
