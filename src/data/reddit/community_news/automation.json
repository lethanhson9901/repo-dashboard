The part people underestimate is how tiny the trust window is on LinkedIn – one lazy DM or off-tone comment and you’re muted forever.\n\nWhat’s worked for me is automating inputs, not outputs. Use stuff like Taplio/Shield to surface posts from your ICP, Perplexity/ChatGPT to draft 3–4 angles for a comment, then you pick one and rewrite it in your own words before hitting send. Same for connection notes and posts: AI gives you structure, you inject the specifics (numbers, client stories, tradeoffs you actually made).\n\nOn the research side, I lean on Apollo and even Reddit tools like GummySearch and Pulse for Reddit alongside LI search to see what people are actually complaining about, then bring that language into LinkedIn. Keep the clicking and posting human; make the research and idea-gen the “automated” layer.",

The key is to keep interactions natural and relevant to your target audience. We've developed a service that finds fresh leads based on ideal customer profile, then sends warm connection requests with personalized messages. We also automate light engagement like liking posts to build familiarity before outreach. After that we handle the conversation manually. This approach reduces risk while still allowing us to scale effectively.",

(got my account banned pretty quick on an tool i used a year ago)\n\nA lot of them use Chrome extensions that basically inject code into LinkedIn's page. LinkedIn can spot that pretty easily, and that's usually where people get flagged.\n\nThe tool I use now runs everything in the cloud (not through the browser) and uses residential IPs, so it just looks like you're using your phone or laptop normally. Been using it for a few months now, no issues at all.\n\nThat said, regardless of what you use, what i learnt is: Don't go crazy with volume, do a warmup of you LK account. Personalize stuff (first name, company, whatever makes sense) with custom variables and don't spam people with links in the first messages, engage for real. Anyway, hope that helps!",

All I've got is that I guess OpenClaw is the easiest and quickest way to get an agent up and running and contributed to a boom, I guess, and they used to have similar names? Because it doesn't seem like a natural fit at all.\n\nHaving agents corralled off in an environment to iteratively imitate a community is kinda funny. It's meaningless drivel and I don't believe the hype, but conceptually it entertains me. The part that loses me is that OpenClaw is an agent framework specifically designed to be able to interact locally with an operating system and user data. There is absolutely no part of \"live in this online community, read threads and reply\" that needs access to an OS, or (god help you) someone's personal files. That a program that by default is a rogue superuser on a machine became the most common tool to interact with MoltBook is ridiculous and it seems weird to me that that's not getting pointed out much.\n\nLiterally any isolated agent in a cloud service would be a better way to connect, but I guess there's more overhead in getting that running or something?",

This honestly felt like would not worked, but has actually given us similar results!\n\nI guess it really depends on how competitive your industry is! We dint really have big competitors in our field doing! So we very quickly became the top results for almost every question! Our website is also pretty old, so that probably helped with authority as well!

A lot of data centres currently offset loans against a future sell on value of the GPUs. \n- data centres are often seen as a future investment - e.g. if the company went down, the physical data centre, the wires in the ground etc are still a useful asset. \n- Solar storms seem to offer a threat that would be not present in a traditional data centre, and might increase hardware failure rates over time. \n\nI don’t know if the economics of the solar power and potential for heat dissipation outweigh these significantly, but it seems very wasteful unless the expected shelf life of space data centres is some how longer. It feels like these would be sent up and then just left to die ands replaced with others. \n\nI know xAI had some huge fights over the gas turbines they needed to install to fuel their expedited data centre builds, so maybe energy generation is something that musk and others are especially focused on as they try to scale.",

But I burned through my entire $20 monthly quota just generating one 2-minute video. Couldn't even go back and iterate on it without waiting for the next billing cycle.\n\nTried moving to VS Code to keep editing but the whole flow felt broken at that point.\n\nI got curious about how the whole thing actually works. Spent a few hours digging into Remotion, understanding how Claude was orchestrating everything, and ended up building my own agent that does something similar.\n\nBeen using it for the past few weeks to make explainer videos and product demos. Still rough around the edges but it works. I can actually iterate now without watching my credits disappear.\n\nI never really cracked motion graphics before this. Tried After Effects, tried Canva videos, tried a bunch of other tools. Nothing stuck. The Claude + Remotion combo was the first time I actually finished a video I was happy with. So when the credits ran out I just wanted to keep that going.\n\nAnyway, mostly posting to see if anyone else ran into the same quota problem or if people are even interested in prompt-to-video stuff outside of the Claude ecosystem.

For things like content, Meta, influencers, things are pretty easy as there are platforms that aggregate all the data and make it easy to view.\n\nWhen it comes to the impact of marketing campaigns on product adoption, however, I find myself struggling. Most data related to adoption metrics, subscription changes, user behaviour, etc. are all data that needs to be exported from the database (Postgres) using SQL.\n\nThe current method to get this data involves asking devs to write SQL, or using LLMs to create SQL (nearly always wrong). I try to learn some SQL as well, but find it hard to find time as I am a family man since recently.\n\nI have noticed that some people use ai tools to bypass the need for SQL and interact with data directly. I don't mean the traditional BI tools like PowerBI and Tableau, but less popular tools like TalkBI. The team thinks it is a risk to connect our database to such tools and so far not much is happening. I am running out of options here. Can you please help me figure out any alternative solutions?",

When marketing questions require dev time or fragile LLM queries, analysis becomes sporadic and slow, so decisions lag behind reality.

A practical alternative is to define a small set of **blessed, read-only metrics views** in the database that devs own once, and marketing can query safely forever.

Once you identify those, you can version control the SQL, have devs sign off once, and then marketing just looks at auto-updated spreadsheets.\n\nFor ad-hoc questions, we use a combo approach: marketing describes what they want in plain english, an LLM generates a candidate query, but it runs against a staging copy first and gets human review before touching real data. The LLM is surprisingly good at modifying existing working queries but terrible at writing complex ones from scratch.\n\nThe security concern is valid - never give an external tool direct prod access.

Most people are looking for \"AI that can sell like Jordan Belfort,\" but the real gold is just solving the Speed to Lead problem.\n\nStatistically, if you don't respond to a lead within 5 minutes, your chances of qualifying them drop by like 80%. Humans can’t be at their desks 24/7, but the AI doesn't get \"burnout\" after 50 calls or take a 1-hour lunch break right when a high-intent lead rings.\n\nIt’s less about \"persuasion\" and more about availability.\n\nOne thing though, how are you handling the data sync? Are you feeding the AI summaries back into your CRM automatically? I’ve found that the real \"magic\" happens when the human rep jumps on the follow-up call already knowing exactly what the lead’s pain point is because they read the AI’s notes first.",

The 'doubled sales' phenomenon usually isn't about the AI's closing skills but rather it's about solving the **Lead Decay Gap**.\n\nMost people don't realize that lead response at the 5-minute mark is 10x more effective than at 30 minutes. By using an assistant for the 'Inbound + Qualification' layer, you're essentially fixing a revenue killer.\n\nTo give some data-driven context for those skeptical about the 'robotic' feel:\n\n* **The Nuance:** The best results come when the AI handles the *administrative* friction (FAQs, booking) rather than trying to mimic a human closer.\n* **The Tech Signal:** Modern LLM-based voice engines have dropped latency to sub-second levels, which is why customers 'don't mind' the frustration of waiting on hold is higher than the friction of talking to a clear AI.\n* **The Filter:** Having the AI tag 'high-intent' vs 'tire-kickers' in the call summaries allows your human team to actually do the deep work they were hired for.\n\n**One tip for your setup:** If you aren't already, try linking the call summaries directly into your CRM via webhook. It saves the sales team another 20% of their admin time.",

Here is exactly how I generated the 3x3 grid above:\n\n1. **Upload your reference image** to Gemini 3 Pro\n2. **Use this specific \"Extraction\" Prompt:** `\"Help me extract the entire visual effect of this image as a Prompt in JSON format. Include but do not limit to: color palette, lighting, composition, stylistic effects, camera lens, and character details.\"`\n3. **Generate through Nano Banana Pro:** I take the JSON output and feed it into Nano Banana Pro via Atlas Cloud. I’m using Atlas because it’s easy to iterate in the Playground and via the API (I wired it into an n8n workflow).\n\n**And here is the exact prompt I used:**\n\n*Prompt: A professional 3x3 grid layout of 9 high-quality portrait photos featuring a consistent character of a stunning young East Asian woman with long wavy dark hair and small silver earrings, wearing a black strapless tube top. Each grid cell shows a distinct and highly differentiated facial expression to ensure no repetition.*\n\n*The 9 expressions are:*\n\n1. *Top Row: \\[Gentle wink with a subtle smile\\] | \\[Wide teeth-showing joyful grin\\] | \\[Angry scowl with furrowed brows\\].*\n2. *Middle Row: \\[Playful wink with a cheeky tongue-out\\] | \\[Bursted loud laughter with closed eyes\\] | \\[Disgusted face with a wrinkled nose\\].*\n3. *Bottom Row: \\[Naughty side-view with tongue sticking out\\] | \\[Ecstatic head-tilted laughter\\] | \\[Depressed downward gaze with a sad pout\\].*\n\n*Technical Settings: Clean solid light grey background, soft studio high-key lighting, ultra-realistic skin texture with visible pores, 8k resolution, cinematic photography, shot on 85mm lens, f/1.8, hyper-detailed, masterpiece, photorealistic.”*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0mb5gotrdphg1.jpg?width=747&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da1c25184d716e9bee8c811c44df1e6675b427c4\n\n**A couple practical notes:**\n\n* If the first result isn't exactly what you’re looking for, just run it for a few more rounds.\n* The biggest win for me is having the “style/character DNA” captured in JSON so I’m not rewriting the same description every time.\n\nI turned this into an n8n workflow and used it for a small portrait “style match” service to a few people on IG. They give me a reference image, I generate a batch in the same style, pick the best set, deliver.\n\nHonestly, in this era, making money with AI feels *way too easy* if you can package a repeatable workflow:)",

If you strip the language away, this looks very similar to task marketplaces that already exist, just with an algorithm doing the matching instead of a human. What feels different is the framing of people as a “layer” rather than as agents with judgment and choice.\n\nThe risk I see is not that AI delegates work, that already happens, but that responsibility and context get abstracted away. When a human assigns a task, there is usually some shared understanding of consequences and quality. When an agent does it, that accountability can get fuzzy fast. Whether this becomes dystopian or just another weird labor market experiment probably depends on how much agency and transparency the humans on the other side actually retain.",

I thought it’d just be a basic IVR replacement.\n\nTurns out, that decision changed everything.\n\nHere’s what happened:\n\nEvery call got answered (no more “call back later”)\n\nLeads were qualified instantly instead of waiting hours\n\nFollow-ups happened automatically\n\nSales reps only talked to warm leads\n\nWithin 6-8 weeks, our sales were up nearly 3x.\n\nNot because the AI was “selling” better than humans, but because:\n\nNo leads slipped through the cracks\n\nResponse time went from hours → seconds\n\nOur team focused only on closing\n\nBiggest surprise? Customers didn’t mind talking to AI at all most didn’t even realize it at first.\n\nCurious if anyone else here has seen similar results with AI voice tools, or if we just got lucky.

I started a tech agency a year ago instead of sitting for placements.\n\n**The Situation:** I have the tech stack, the IP, and a proven model. We are projected to do \\~50-60L ($60k–$70k) in revenue this year with about 30 high-paying clients. I have a small sales team across India and the US, but our bottleneck is scale.\n\n**The Deal:** I have an opportunity to partner with a larger company that dominates distribution in my niche. They want 50% economical ownership of my company. In exchange, I get immediate access to their massive network and distribution channels.\n\n**The Dilemma:**\n\n1. **The Upside:** We could grow exponentially faster using their network.\n2. **The Downside:** I lose 50% equity and control. If I say no, they might become a direct competitor.\n3. **The Trust Issue:** My co-founder and family do not trust this partner. My gut says the distribution is worth it, but their instincts are making me hesitate.\n\n**The Question:** Is it worth giving up 50% equity for guaranteed distribution? Or should I grind it out independently with my own sales team (slower growth, 100% control) and risk fighting them as a competitor?\n\nHas anyone here taken a 50/50 distribution deal, and did you regret it?",

Join and check other community groups. 50% sounds like a lot and if your partner has been trustworthy, I would trust him. You should look at other options before settling.\n\nIs there anyway you could consult with someone  else who has a network that is worth less than 50% equity of your company? You said you have a proven scalable method. Anyway, you could interest them in a smaller portion of equity or another type of shareholder value to your company with different rights…even looking at possible different terms of that with lower ownership equity amount…\n\nJust some solutions from a quick review with Claude:\n\nAlternative Structures to Explore\nDon’t accept their first offer. Here are better frameworks:\n1. Revenue Share Partnership (No Equity)\n\t∙\tThey get 20-30% of revenue from clients they source\n\t∙\tYou retain 100% equity and control\n\t∙\tTime-bound agreement (2-3 years) with performance milestones\n\t∙\tLower risk, maintains optionality\n\n2. Tiered Equity with Vesting\n\t∙\tStart with 20% equity tied to performance milestones\n\t∙\tEarn up to 50% only if they deliver X revenue over Y timeframe\n\t∙\tIncludes buyback provisions if relationship fails\n\t∙\tProtects you from giving equity for empty promises\n\n3. Strategic Investment Model\n\t∙\tThey invest capital at a fair valuation for 25-30% equity\n\t∙\tYou use capital to build your own distribution team\n\t∙\tThey provide intros/network access without operational control\n\t∙\tCleaner cap table, maintains your control\n\n4. Joint Venture Structure\n\t∙\tCreate a separate entity for the partnership (60/40 or 70/30 in your favor)\n\t∙\tYour tech company remains independent\n\t∙\tJV licenses your IP, they contribute distribution\n\t∙\tLimits downside, protects your core asset\n\nMy Recommendation: Structured Counter-Proposal\n\nStep 1: Test Their Commitment\nPropose a 90-day pilot partnership:\n\t∙\tNo equity exchanged\n\t∙\tThey source clients, you deliver service\n\t∙\tRevenue split: 70/30 (you/them) on pilot clients\n\t∙\tBoth parties evaluate fit before discussing equity\nThis reveals:\n\t∙\tWhether their distribution is real or overhyped\n\t∙\tHow they operate as partners\n\t∙\tWhether the relationship has cultural fit\n\nStep 2: Negotiate from Data\nIf pilot works, come back with:\n\t∙\t25% equity (not 50%) with 4-year vesting tied to revenue milestones\n\t∙\tProtective provisions: Board seat, drag-along rights, IP protection clauses\n\t∙\tBuyback option: If they don’t hit milestones, you can repurchase equity at predetermined valuation\n\t∙\tNon-compete agreement: They cannot build competing tech for X years\n\nStep 3: Build Alternatives Simultaneously\nWhile negotiating:\n\t∙\tInvest heavily in YOUR sales team and distribution\n\t∙\tExplore other potential distribution partners\n\t∙\tDocument your IP and consider defensive patents/trademarks\n\t∙\tBuild leverage by showing you don’t need them, you’re just open to acceleration",

If he’s not Mark Cuban on one of the other dudes on Shark Tank that’s a bad deal. You can automate your marketing w/ n8n and/or Notion for less than $15 a month including blogs, a calendar, todo lists, all centralized. The only thing I would say would be valuable in this circumstance that I don’t have enough details on in all fairness, is who that person is and who he knows. If he has a network with the second and third level contacts that have money and reputation, that’s a different story. 50% under any circumstances unacceptable because all it takes is a smart stock play and now he’s the owner of the company. I would say I only wanna give you 20, let him say no two times, and then break and say I’ll give you 30% with an extra 30% that profit of sales. He walks away, feeling like he won.

AI SDR? who cares, I've already set up a hardcoded workflow that's printing leads.\n\nSome are building \"AI product managers\", this feels like the right approach but still early and feels clunky. My hypothesis is that it's hard to define great PMs and so it's even harder to encode them into workflows.\n\nFrontier labs are going after the largest TAM possible, and by logic these are the 0-1 founders and companies, they're great but replaces the VAs and not really a key to helping me scale to $5M range.\n\nAI Enterprise solutions dominate because custom solutions are hard and worth millions. Labs like 8090 prove it. Irrelevant for me.\n\nBest counter examples I've seen are around automating back-office work like accounting and data entry, I've even gotten feedback that I'm thinking about this entirely the wrong way: that AI shouldn't be used to save time but enable one to \"do more\". I'm not entirely convinced on it.\n\nRight now it's much more effective to just hire capable people and scale them instead at the middle stage I'm talking about. This will likely change in 6 months of time, so the dilemma is wether you hire now or wait and see and forgo bigger growth at the same time.\n\nTL;DR Someone needs to build boring, focused AI tooling for the $1M–$5M operator, we're the most underserved market in tech.",

          "text": "Perhaps you're right... Perhaps AI is useless for \"the $1M-$5M business operator,\", or perhaps just for your specific use case scenario at this time. \n\nThis is likely a workflow issue for your specific situation. Not a true indication of AI viability at that level of structure. \n\nSince every business is different, and ever busines builder is different, every AI use case will likely be different as well. Hell, I made the top 3% of usage on ChatGPT as a soloist last year. I've done over 60k pages worth of material in the last three years, and I am not even using it to write these responses. :)\n\nSo it just truly matters what you are using it for, what your workflows and your specific needs are like. If you already have a well-defined workflow, have eliminated unnecessary tasks, and have streamlined before using AI, then yeah, it might not help you as much.\n\nI would still wager there are steps that could still be more optimal or enhanced through the use of AI that could, in fact, be implemented. You simply might not be implementing those types of tasks yet. \n\nThere will always be tradeoff points for hiring vs using a new tool. Whether you are talking AI or a new video editor, someone has to take time to learn the new tool before becoming proficient with it. That's the nature of the beast. So yes, there will always be a bit of a back and forth on this concept of \"easier to onboard new staff\" than to revamp your entire workflow. \n\nPersonally, when it comes to AI, I actually slow down at times because of issues such as AI slop. Not all AI usage has to be ultr-fast, redundant, crap. So there must be a balance even with AI.\n\nAs for \"TL;DR Someone needs to build boring, focused AI tooling for the $1M–$5M operator, we're the most underserved market in tech.\"\n\nYou could always build this. This is often how things get started. You are the best person to know what you are looking for. Many of the solutions I have developed over the years (4 decades of Dev Work), have almost always been custom solutions that I needed. There's a bit of a Dev roadmap that makes life a lot easier in the process, but many large-scale companies started as a single software tool. \n\nMany of these tools started as fixes to problems, often recurring problems. They were fixed, but often never meant to become products in the first place. \n\nWhat’s different now is the scope of what’s expected. You’re not just writing code anymore. You’re juggling systems, automation, testing, deployment, infra, security, and now AI on top of all of that. None of that is wrong, but the tooling landscape feels polarized. You either get lightweight hacker tools or massive enterprise platforms that assume layers of staff and process.\n\nThe $1M–$5M operator is stuck in the middle. They don’t need flashy innovation. They need boring, opinionated tools that reduce friction and cognitive load, standardize the obvious stuff, and let people focus on the work. “Boring” is kind of the point, and calm systems beat clever ones when you’re trying to run an actual business.\n\nIf you’re already operating in that space, you’re probably in a better position than most vendors to assemble something focused that actually reduces friction instead of adding another platform to manage.\n\nAs a developer, it could take me months to fully flesh out the industry that you are in ona level that would truly \"impact that market sector\". I wrote custom call center software for years; that's a highly specific industry. But I was in that industry to begin with. You have the built-in experience, knowledge, and understanding of your needs better than an outside developer would. \n\nIf you were to build the framework, based on the needs and functions that you required, then you could hand that off to developers and have it built.",

Drop your audio files into a Dropbox or Google Drive folder, and the automation picks them up, sends them to Whisper for transcription, then saves the output with a matching filename. You can add a second step that runs the transcript through GPT to clean up filler words, fix punctuation, and format into proper paragraphs.\n\nFor organising the files, a naming convention like YYYYMMDD_clientname_topic.mp3 saves you a lot of pain later. If you sort by subfolders (one per client or project), the automation can tag transcripts based on where they came from, which makes searching through them way easier down the line.\n\nOne thing to watch: Whisper has a 25MB file limit and accuracy drops on very long recordings. If your interviews run over an hour, chunk them before sending. The API costs about $0.006 per minute, so a full hour comes out to roughly $0.36. At that price the bottleneck is really just the manual review for proper nouns and industry terms, which usually takes a fraction of the time compared to transcribing from scratch.",

The key was finding something that could just chew through that folder automatically without me babying each file.\n\nI tried a few cloud services with batch upload, but the pricing got weird with volume. What actually stuck for me was using a dedicated device—BOYA Notra—because it handles the recording, dumps the files to an app, and auto-transcribes in batches in the background. It's not perfect, but it gets like 90% there for clear audio, which is way better than starting from zero. The summaries it generates let me triage which files need careful review first.\n\nPost-process, I do a quick find/replace for common jargon and then a single listen-through on 1.5x speed for corrections.

Name and email capture is also deceptively hard because you need a confirmation loop that does not feel robotic, plus a fallback like spelling or SMS verification when confidence is low.\n\nCalendar sync issues tend to be less frequent but more damaging when they happen, especially time zones, double booking, and stale availability. The systems that feel reliable are the ones that treat every external call as “may fail” and have a graceful recovery path that does not lose the user or create phantom bookings.

Incremental confirmations: Instead of waiting until the end, I confirm critical fields as they come up — e.g., Just to confirm, did you say 3 PM on Thursday? This keeps the thread clean and avoids compounding errors.\n2. Confidence-based fallbacks: For names, emails or dates, if the model isn’t confident, trigger a polite clarification or an SMS/email verification loop. This keeps it human-like but accurate.\n3. Resilient calendar logic: Treat every API call as potentially failing. Implement retries, double-booking checks, time zone normalization and a fallback message if availability can’t be confirmed.\n4. Threaded state tracking: Maintain a clear confirmed vs. assumed map for every interaction. This way, even mid-sentence changes or partial answers don’t break the workflow.\nThe combination of incremental confirmation + confidence checks + robust API handling is what makes the system feel reliable in real-world chaos.\nIf anyone is stuck with this, I’m happy to share a practical pattern for implementing it in a voice-agent workflow.",

Over-confirming can tank flow just as fast as under-confirming. Curious how you decide which fields are hard gates and which ones can stay tentative until the end.",

It can browse the web, read messages, and actually do tasks for you instead of just answering questions. If you like the idea of a self-hosted AI assistant that you control, it’s pretty impressive.\n\n**The bad:**  \nThat same power makes it risky if you don’t set it up properly. A lot of people seem to be running OpenClaw with open ports there are reports of 20,000+ instances accessible from the public internet.\n\nOne of the biggest risks is prompt injection. Since OpenClaw reads emails, web pages, and messages, someone could hide malicious instructions in content the agent sees, and trick it into doing things you never intended. At that point, your own AI assistant can work against you.\n\nBecause of that, running OpenClaw publicly feels like asking for trouble.\n\n**How I set up OpenClaw with Meshnet** \n\nWhat I did instead: I kept my OpenClaw instance LAN-only and accessed it remotely over Meshnet, so it was never exposed to the public internet. Since I already had a NordVPN account, I remembered Meshnet, a pretty useful feature, and thought it could actually solve this problem. It let me access OpenClaw remotely without exposing it to the public internet.\n\n**1. Install OpenClaw locally**  \nLinux works best. On Windows, running it via WSL makes things much easier. Go through the QuickStart onboarding and keep the setup minimal.\n\n**2. Bind OpenClaw to LAN only**  \nBy default, OpenClaw listens on loopback. Edit the OpenClaw config so it binds to the LAN interface instead and enable the local control UI. This allows access only from your local network.\n\n**3. Enable Meshnet on the OpenClaw machine**  \nInstall NordVPN, log in, and enable Meshnet. This gives the machine a private Meshnet address that’s only reachable by devices you explicitly allow.\n\n**4. Access OpenClaw over Meshnet**  \nFrom another trusted device on your Meshnet, open a browser and connect to:  \n`meshnet-name-or-ip:18789`  \nNo public IP, no port forwarding, no exposure.\n\n**5. Authenticate using a token**  \nOpenClaw uses token-based authentication. Grab the token locally via the OpenClaw CLI, paste it into the dashboard once, and you’re in.\n\nAt that point, OpenClaw behaves like a local service - even when you’re accessing it remotely.\n\n**Why this setup is much safer**\n\n* OpenClaw never touches the public internet\n* No open ports to scan or exploit\n* No random third-party routing\n* Remote access still works as expected\n\nAnyways, in my eyes treating OpenClaw like an internal admin tool instead of a public service makes way more sense given what it can do. And what’s your approach?",

But there are technical ways to handle it.\n​To ensure timing, you need to master Reddit’s search parameters, like sorting by 'relevance' or 'new' and limiting the time range with 't=hour'. From what we've seen, using 'sort=new' usually pulls in way too much trash, so finding the right balance is key. In Huntopic, I pair these specific settings with a database-level deduplication layer to discard anything already seen before any analysis happens.\n​For filtering, instead of relying on keywords alone, an intent-validation pipeline is essential. It focuses on identifying actual pain points or buying signals while filtering out generic discussions.\n​What stack are you using for this automation, or are you looking for an out-of-the-box solution that already handles this?",

Since I already spend most of my time on job boards, I decided to automate this part directly where the application happens.\n\nSo I ended up building a Chrome extension called AutoTailor to automate this process it:\n\n* Reads the job description on the page\n* Helps tailor my CV to that role\n* Generates a matching cover letter without leaving the site\n\nRight now it’s still early.
