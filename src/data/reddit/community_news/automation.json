This honestly felt like would not worked, but has actually given us similar results!\n\nI guess it really depends on how competitive your industry is! We dint really have big competitors in our field doing! So we very quickly became the top results for almost every question! Our website is also pretty old, so that probably helped with authority as well! I am curious to understand how this would work out as everyone adopts these automation- at that point its probably a war between AIs and the best AI wins probably haha!",

A website changes a small thing. An auth flow expires. A script succeeds but returns partial data. Suddenly the automation is still “running” but the output is quietly wrong. You only notice weeks later when numbers stop making sense. Debugging after the fact is way harder than building the thing in the first place.\n\nFor me, the biggest pain point has always been anything that touches the web. Scraping, form filling, pulling data from dashboards. It is rarely the logic that fails, it is the environment. I started treating web interaction as infrastructure instead of just another step in the workflow. Using more controlled browser execution, including experimenting with tools like hyperbrowser, reduced a lot of silent failures because the behavior was more consistent run to run.\n\nCurious how others here think about resilience. Do you add more checks and alerts? Snapshot outputs and diff them? Or do you just accept that automations need regular babysitting once they leave the prototype stage?",

Basically, I treat the data as 'guilty until proven innocent.'\nInstead of just checking 'Did the script finish?', I add a logic node at the end that asks:\n1. Is the payload size reasonable? (e.g., If I usually get 50 items and today I got 2, force a fail).\n2. Are critical fields populated?

Eventually stumbled on Actionbook to handle the action manuals + DOM caching stuff, which cut down those \"element not found\" flakes by like 90%. Still fails sometimes, but now it's usually for real reasons, not just random noise.\n\nDo you snapshot your output data and diff it daily?

Thanks to LLMs and AI tools like Frizerly, the whole process is now automated! It's able to look at Google analytics and automatically come up with both a strategy and content and post it directly on our website with content specifically trained on our product and case studies!\n* Translations: Again, before LLMs, we had to hire freelancers to translate content because we need most of our content in both english and French!

          "text": "Document data extraction and analysis. Before GenAI, automating this process required training a model for each document type and often broke down when documents didn’t follow the format it was trained on. Now, with tools powered by LLMs, the whole process is faster, smarter, and way more flexible.\n\nFor instance, platforms like kudra ai (affiliated) use AI to extract data from unstructured documents, think contracts, invoices, or even shipping manifests, and turn it into structured, searchable information in seconds. What’s cool is that the AI actually understands the context, so it works even if the document formatting is non-standard or the language is nuanced. Plus, you can build custom workflows to not just extract data but also analyze it, which saves a ton of time for industries like finance, logistics, and legal.\n\nSo yeah, I’d say document handling is one area that’s gone from “meh automation” to “crazy efficient” thanks to GenAI.",

      "text": "So the Claude Code + Remotion skill went viral recently. I tried it out and honestly the video it made was pretty good. But I burned through my entire $20 monthly quota just generating one 2-minute video. Couldn't even go back and iterate on it without waiting for the next billing cycle.\n\nTried moving to VS Code to keep editing but the whole flow felt broken at that point.\n\nI got curious about how the whole thing actually works. Spent a few hours digging into Remotion, understanding how Claude was orchestrating everything, and ended up building my own agent that does something similar.\n\nBeen using it for the past few weeks to make explainer videos and product demos. Still rough around the edges but it works. I can actually iterate now without watching my credits disappear.\n\nI never really cracked motion graphics before this. Tried After Effects, tried Canva videos, tried a bunch of other tools. Nothing stuck. The Claude + Remotion combo was the first time I actually finished a video I was happy with. So when the credits ran out I just wanted to keep that going.\n\nAnyway, mostly posting to see if anyone else ran into the same quota problem or if people are even interested in prompt-to-video stuff outside of the Claude ecosystem. Curious what others are building.",

I started a tech agency a year ago instead of sitting for placements.\n\n**The Situation:** I have the tech stack, the IP, and a proven model. We are projected to do \\~50-60L ($60k–$70k) in revenue this year with about 30 high-paying clients. I have a small sales team across India and the US, but our bottleneck is scale.\n\n**The Deal:** I have an opportunity to partner with a larger company that dominates distribution in my niche. They want 50% economical ownership of my company. In exchange, I get immediate access to their massive network and distribution channels.\n\n**The Dilemma:**\n\n1. **The Upside:** We could grow exponentially faster using their network.\n2. **The Downside:** I lose 50% equity and control. If I say no, they might become a direct competitor.\n3. **The Trust Issue:** My co-founder and family do not trust this partner. My gut says the distribution is worth it, but their instincts are making me hesitate.\n\n**The Question:** Is it worth giving up 50% equity for guaranteed distribution? Or should I grind it out independently with my own sales team (slower growth, 100% control) and risk fighting them as a competitor?\n\nHas anyone here taken a 50/50 distribution deal, and did you regret it?",

Join and check other community groups. 50% sounds like a lot and if your partner has been trustworthy, I would trust him. You should look at other options before settling.\n\nIs there anyway you could consult with someone  else who has a network that is worth less than 50% equity of your company? You said you have a proven scalable method. Anyway, you could interest them in a smaller portion of equity or another type of shareholder value to your company with different rights…even looking at possible different terms of that with lower ownership equity amount…\n\nJust some solutions from a quick review with Claude:\n\nAlternative Structures to Explore\nDon’t accept their first offer. Here are better frameworks:\n1. Revenue Share Partnership (No Equity)\n\t∙\tThey get 20-30% of revenue from clients they source\n\t∙\tYou retain 100% equity and control\n\t∙\tTime-bound agreement (2-3 years) with performance milestones\n\t∙\tLower risk, maintains optionality\n\n2. Tiered Equity with Vesting\n\t∙\tStart with 20% equity tied to performance milestones\n\t∙\tEarn up to 50% only if they deliver X revenue over Y timeframe\n\t∙\tIncludes buyback provisions if relationship fails\n\t∙\tProtects you from giving equity for empty promises\n\n3. Strategic Investment Model\n\t∙\tThey invest capital at a fair valuation for 25-30% equity\n\t∙\tYou use capital to build your own distribution team\n\t∙\tThey provide intros/network access without operational control\n\t∙\tCleaner cap table, maintains your control\n\n4. Joint Venture Structure\n\t∙\tCreate a separate entity for the partnership (60/40 or 70/30 in your favor)\n\t∙\tYour tech company remains independent\n\t∙\tJV licenses your IP, they contribute distribution\n\t∙\tLimits downside, protects your core asset\n\nMy Recommendation: Structured Counter-Proposal\n\nStep 1: Test Their Commitment\nPropose a 90-day pilot partnership:\n\t∙\tNo equity exchanged\n\t∙\tThey source clients, you deliver service\n\t∙\tRevenue split: 70/30 (you/them) on pilot clients\n\t∙\tBoth parties evaluate fit before discussing equity\nThis reveals:\n\t∙\tWhether their distribution is real or overhyped\n\t∙\tHow they operate as partners\n\t∙\tWhether the relationship has cultural fit\n\nStep 2: Negotiate from Data\nIf pilot works, come back with:\n\t∙\t25% equity (not 50%) with 4-year vesting tied to revenue milestones\n\t∙\tProtective provisions: Board seat, drag-along rights, IP protection clauses\n\t∙\tBuyback option: If they don’t hit milestones, you can repurchase equity at predetermined valuation\n\t∙\tNon-compete agreement: They cannot build competing tech for X years\n\nStep 3: Build Alternatives Simultaneously\nWhile negotiating:\n\t∙\tInvest heavily in YOUR sales team and distribution\n\t∙\tExplore other potential distribution partners\n\t∙\tDocument your IP and consider defensive patents/trademarks\n\t∙\tBuild leverage by showing you don’t need them, you’re just open to acceleration",

If he has a network with the second and third level contacts that have money and reputation, that’s a different story. 50% under any circumstances unacceptable because all it takes is a smart stock play and now he’s the owner of the company. I would say I only wanna give you 20, let him say no two times, and then break and say I’ll give you 30% with an extra 30% that profit of sales. He walks away, feeling like he won.

But there are technical ways to handle it.\n​To ensure timing, you need to master Reddit’s search parameters, like sorting by 'relevance' or 'new' and limiting the time range with 't=hour'. From what we've seen, using 'sort=new' usually pulls in way too much trash, so finding the right balance is key. In Huntopic, I pair these specific settings with a database-level deduplication layer to discard anything already seen before any analysis happens.\n​For filtering, instead of relying on keywords alone, an intent-validation pipeline is essential. It focuses on identifying actual pain points or buying signals while filtering out generic discussions.\n​What stack are you using for this automation, or are you looking for an out-of-the-box solution that already handles this?",

It wasn’t hard work - just repetitive and easy to mess up when you’re tired.\n\nI noticed that most tools that did this were separate websites, which meant a lot of copy-pasting between tabs. Since I already spend most of my time on job boards, I decided to automate this part directly where the application happens.\n\nSo I ended up building a Chrome extension called AutoTailor to automate this process it:\n\n* Reads the job description on the page\n* Helps tailor my CV to that role\n* Generates a matching cover letter without leaving the site\n\nRight now it’s still early.

Name and email capture is also deceptively hard because you need a confirmation loop that does not feel robotic, plus a fallback like spelling or SMS verification when confidence is low.\n\nCalendar sync issues tend to be less frequent but more damaging when they happen, especially time zones, double booking, and stale availability. The systems that feel reliable are the ones that treat every external call as “may fail” and have a graceful recovery path that does not lose the user or create phantom bookings.

Incremental confirmations: Instead of waiting until the end, I confirm critical fields as they come up — e.g., Just to confirm, did you say 3 PM on Thursday? This keeps the thread clean and avoids compounding errors.\n2. Confidence-based fallbacks: For names, emails or dates, if the model isn’t confident, trigger a polite clarification or an SMS/email verification loop. This keeps it human-like but accurate.\n3. Resilient calendar logic: Treat every API call as potentially failing. Implement retries, double-booking checks, time zone normalization and a fallback message if availability can’t be confirmed.\n4. Threaded state tracking: Maintain a clear confirmed vs. assumed map for every interaction. This way, even mid-sentence changes or partial answers don’t break the workflow.\nThe combination of incremental confirmation + confidence checks + robust API handling is what makes the system feel reliable in real-world chaos.\nIf anyone is stuck with this, I’m happy to share a practical pattern for implementing it in a voice-agent workflow.",

Batch ingest, normalize audio upfront, then run automated transcription with metadata attached so you always know source, speaker context, and confidence levels later. The real time saver is accepting that the first pass is “good enough” and only routing low confidence segments or specific fields for review instead of rereading everything.\n\nOn the organization side, consistent naming and a simple status state helps more than fancy tooling. Raw, transcribed, reviewed, final. Once you can see where things stall, you can tighten just that part instead of reworking the whole flow. The teams I’ve seen succeed aim for 80 to 90 percent automation and design the last 10 percent to be fast and boring.",

Drop your audio files into a Dropbox or Google Drive folder, and the automation picks them up, sends them to Whisper for transcription, then saves the output with a matching filename. You can add a second step that runs the transcript through GPT to clean up filler words, fix punctuation, and format into proper paragraphs.\n\nFor organising the files, a naming convention like YYYYMMDD_clientname_topic.mp3 saves you a lot of pain later. If you sort by subfolders (one per client or project), the automation can tag transcripts based on where they came from, which makes searching through them way easier down the line.\n\nOne thing to watch: Whisper has a 25MB file limit and accuracy drops on very long recordings. If your interviews run over an hour, chunk them before sending. The API costs about $0.006 per minute, so a full hour comes out to roughly $0.36. At that price the bottleneck is really just the manual review for proper nouns and industry terms, which usually takes a fraction of the time compared to transcribing from scratch.",

      "text": "I understand this might not be the most receptive sub to post this in, but I just cannot stand how some people use AI when it comes to coding! I gotta rant!\n\nFor reference, I am at my first real automation job, I graduated last year with a diploma in automation and robotics and now work at an engineering company designing mining equipment. I am working on one project, and am the only guy working on it, but I have taken over it from someone who has left the company now.\n\nThe biggest part of the project is controlling some motors with a microcontroller programmed in C. I haven't used C in a while, so I have been taking my time trying to remember how it works and how to understand his code... and I just can't. His code is so poorly written that I have to essentially rewrite the whole thing from scratch because it is so hard to understand. The worst part was, even he couldn't explain it to me! His comments make no sense and before he left he didn't really seem to know what it was doing. It worked sure, but I can't integrate it to other systems or add onto it if I can't understand how it's working.\n\nFast forward to today, where I got so frustrated with something in my new code not working I caved and asked chatgpt. I personally do not like using AI for my work, because I want to understand how it works myself, but when I cannot find an answer elsewhere it helps. It spat out some example code at me and I was shocked because it was formatted almost exactly like the code I was trying to replace. I fed some of the old code back into it, and it said it was highly likely that it was AI generated. Suddenly it made so much sense why the guy before me couldn't explain how it worked - he didn't write it!\n\nNow I am going to have to spend likely a week or more just rewriting the code so that I can add more systems to it later all because he couldn't be bothered to understand what he was writing. I think AI has its uses, and I know it has helped me when I'm slamming my head into a wall sometimes, but people who use it to write all of their code are only going to cause more time to be wasted down the line.\n\nRant done! I'm over it! Onward!",

I’m not glued to the screen trying to type. I read the itemized transcription with AI summaries. Job done for me.\n\n\nDoes anyone else have a \"low friction\" way to handle meeting notes?
