      "text": "I keep seeing this take on Reddit that doesn't matter what tool you use, LinkedIn will detect ANY automation and ban you. this is wrong, technically\n\nI've been running LinkedIn outbound for B2B clients for a while and got curious enough to actually understand how these tools work under the hood. Turns out the type of technology matters way more than we realize. LinkedIn detects automation based on HOW the tool interacts with their platform. not all methods are equally visible. I know only 3 types of automation (if you know more, let me know):\n\n1. Extensions.\n2. Cloud based services\n3. Standalone browsers\n\nChrome **extensions** like Dux-Soup or Waalaxy inject JavaScript directly into LinkedIn's webpage. Every extension has a Chrome Store ID and local files. LinkedIn literally runs scripts to search for these IDs.\n\n**Cloud services l**ike Expandi, Dripify, Lemlist send API requests from remote servers. When you browse LinkedIn normally, your browser fires off tons of background requests - analytics, feed refreshes, notification checks. Cloud tools only send the bare minimum requests they need. LinkedIn can see your API traffic is incomplete compared to real users. Still they are harder to spot than extensions, but not impossible.\n\n**Standalone browsers** (LinkedHelper is the main one I know) work like a modified Chromium browser running locally. It uses LinkedIn like a normal browser would, but automated, it mimics mouse movements, randomized timing and other patterns of human behavior. LinkedIn detection systems are looking for specific technical fingerprints, and when it's a standalone browser, it's hard to distinguish from human. I'm not saying standalone browsers are undetectable or that you can't get banned using them, but the risk is different. From what I've heard you can't use your LinkedIn account from a different browser at the same time as your automation tool works, and you have limits to follow.\n\nIf you've've been banned, what were you using and what do you think the actual trigger was? trying to separate technical detection from just behavioral red flags\n\n",

          "text": "This is a much more nuanced take than the usual “automation = instant ban” line, and you’re right — **the** ***how*** **matters a lot**.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen, LinkedIn’s enforcement is a mix of **technical fingerprints + behavioral signals**, not some magical automation detector. Extensions are the easiest to flag because they literally announce themselves. Cloud tools sit in an awkward middle ground — cleaner than extensions, but their traffic patterns often don’t look like a real browsing session.\n\nStandalone browsers are interesting because they blur that line. They behave like a full browser, generate “normal-looking” noise, and avoid obvious extension fingerprints. That doesn’t make them safe, but it *does* change the risk profile.\n\nOne thing I’d add: a lot of bans people blame on “automation” are actually **behavioral**:\n\n* sending too many connection requests\n* repeating the same copy\n* moving faster than any human ever would\n* logging in from multiple environments at once\n\nTech gets you noticed, behavior gets you flagged.\n\nIn most ban stories I’ve heard, it’s rarely one single thing — it’s automation *plus* aggressive patterns. Separating those two, like you’re trying to do here, is the right way to think about it.",

Tools are everywhere, setup is fast, and half the time it feels like you’re just connecting boxes.\n\nWhat still feels oddly difficult is deciding what’s actually worth automating. I’ve definitely fallen into the trap of automating stuff just because I could. Research steps, enrichment, handoffs, little checks that used to be manual. Some of it genuinely saves time. Some of it just creates cleaner looking chaos. I bounce between a few tools depending on the workflow. I use Clay a lot for upstream research and signals, Notion to keep things visible, Zapier for glue work, and HubSpot as the system of record. None of them are the problem on their own.\n\nThe tricky part is that bad automation doesn’t feel broken right away. It feels productive. Stuff moves, tasks disappear, dashboards look nicer. Then a week later you realize you’re reviewing outputs that didn’t need to exist, or worse, trusting something you shouldn’t have. Lately I’ve been trying to be more intentional about where automation stops and where judgment actually matters. Less about how much I can automate, more about whether the step creates leverage or just saves a few clicks.\n\nCurious how others here think about this. How do you decide what stays manual on purpose vs what gets automated without thinking too hard about it.",

          "text": "Yes, exactly, the key point in automation is really knowing when it actually makes sense to use it. Here’s how I usually decide what to automate to make sure automation is actually effective:\n\n1 .  Simple rule: automate the flow, not the decision\n\nThe idea is that automation works best when the process is repetitive, predictable, and follows a clear workflow.\n\nSo it makes sense to automate things where:\n\n* there’s a clear path (“if A → do B”)\n* there are very few unknowns or unexpected turns\n* mistakes aren’t expensive\n* the output is easy to verify\n\nBut decisions that involve a lot of nuance, risk, and context are better left to a human.\n\nFor example, you can automate:\n\n* data collection / moving information between systems\n* reminders / statuses / syncing\n* “draft-level” classification (tags, categories, priority)\n\n2 . The “leverage test”: does it create leverage or just save 3 clicks?\n\nIf an automation:\n\n* speeds up the cycle (lead → meeting → payment)\n* reduces losses (missed calls / forgotten leads)\n* improves quality (fewer mistakes / higher conversion) then it’s worth doing.\n\nIf it just “looks nice” but adds another layer of checking, it usually doesn’t bring real value, it’s basically what you said: “clean-looking chaos.”\n\nHope this helps! Feel free to ask if you have any other questions.",

Its called process mining.\n\nBasically you collect logs and timestamps of events from the tools that teams use and use that data to show you where things are inefficient. It will automatically map out the process and basically tell you exactly where you should be looking.\n\nSince most process mining tools are pretty expensive, I built my own that works pretty well. Considering opening it up to the public. \n\nYou could easily do something similar yourself with airtable and whatever automation tool of choice",

See 'I think “agent” may finally have a widely enough agreed upon definition to be useful jargon now' by Simon Willison and 'Everyone write and agent' by Fly.\n2. Someone else writes the 'agent harness' (read: the loop and environment) but you still prompt and handle the data flow in and out. See Claude Agent SDK, n8n.\n3. The 'agent' is actually a service. You give it a task, it returns the result. See Sierra, Jack&Jill.\n\nSo I think you should specify whether you mean (1), (2) or (3) when you say 'agentic AI'.\n\nTo give you an answer without that context (or the context of what isn't working on 'real workflows'), having built (1) and used a few of the SDKs, though:\n\nObservability.\n\nYou need to see:\n- what context is going in to the agent at each turn, and\n- what is it responding with?\n\nAfter that, ease of evaluation.\n\nHappy to help further if you provide more detail.",

It provides all the required details to the client, also books appointments for the clients, gives confirmation lines to the client, and stores the summary of the call for the organization.\n\n AI tools provide many useful features that are helpful for small to medium businesses, as they provide summarized chats of conversations , scalability , data security and Multilingual Support. Most importantly, they are AI-based, so they are available 24/7 to answer users' questions without any frustration. \n\nI have a reference for the tool that provides all of this.

I found my first few via Upwork, Fiverr, and LinkedIn\n* Keep messages short and focused on value (X+ hours saved or $X saved) and skip all technical details in the pitch\n* Follow-up religiously with people who showed interest until they say yes or no clearly\n* Ask for reviews and referrals once you have them as customers\n\n5 clients paying you \\~$100/month isn’t a lot, but it gets you started and once you have social proof trust compounds and you can scale much faster.\n\nCurious how other people here got their first clients?",

There are plenty of free tutorials on YouTube that will teach you how to automate things. Do enough of those and you'll get the basics down pretty quickly. Once you got that, keep a list of things you want to automate for yourself and get to work.\n\nIm terms of tools, if you're brand new, I'd say start with zapier to get a fundamental understanding of automation in the simplest form. Graduate to make, then n8n.\n\nAnd do yourself a favor, learn to market yourself and build an email list while you're learning. Your future self with thank you. Trust me",

How are you inspecting why it reacted a certain way three or four cycles later, not just what it did in the moment?\n\nThe idea is compelling. The risk is that social looking behavior masks the lack of clear accountability when something goes wrong. That tends to be where real world deployments struggle.",

      "text": "There’s been a lot of talk around n8n vs Zapier, and that’s how this started for me. Not really out of curiosity, but from trying a few tools, building small workflows, and realizing how much time went into maintenance.\n\n**How I got here**\n\nFor me it started with Make. It can do a lot and it has many integrations, similar to Zapier in that sense. Over time though, it became noisy. Too many steps, too many things to watch. I was fixing workflows more than actually using them.\n\nLater I tried Gumloop, and that felt lighter and easier to get into. I didn’t need to plan everything upfront just to make simple things work. After jumping between tools for a while, I stopped comparing them one by one and looked at a comparison table instead. Seeing different automation tools side by side, with features and limits in one place, made the differences clearer.\n\n**n8n vs Zapier - how they feel in practice**\n\nWhen people talk about n8n vs Zapier, it often turns into a technical discussion. For me, it feels more like a working style question.\n\n**Zapier**\n\nWhat works well:\n\n* Feels steady and predictable\n* Easy to start with\n* You set it up and move on\n* Usually very reliable\n\nTrade-offs\n\n* As workflows grow, limits become noticeable\n* Pricing scales quickly\n* Flexibility drops over time\n\n**n8n**\n\nWhat works well:\n\n* Much closer to the workflow itself\n* More control\n* More room to customize logic\n\nTrade-offs\n\n* Requires more involvement\n* Setup and maintenance are part of the deal\n* Fixing things is expected when something changes\n\n**Final take**\n\nI don’t think there’s a final answer here. After trying different tools and comparing them side by side, it became clear that both have their pros and cons. The right choice depends on how much simplicity or control you need at a given point.  \n  \nDo you stick with one tool, or keep adjusting as things change?",

I’d log hook, length, topic, and watch/CTR stats per video, then have a separate job that summarizes what actually works and feeds that back into your script prompt as constraints.\n\n\n\nAlso worth splitting the workflow into modular stages: idea sourcing (trending subs/YouTube keywords), script, visual plan, then video. That way you can A/B test hooks and scripts without regenerating the whole thing. I’ve chained things like Make and Zapier with vid tools (e.g., Pika or Runway) and a tracker like Notion/Airtable; Pulse plus keyword alerts and scheduling tools can watch for niche trends and auto-queue new video ideas. Main focus I’d push on: close the loop so the system learns, instead of you handpicking winners forever.",

Context gets lost, agents behave unpredictably, and edge cases pile up fast.\n\nI’ve seen people mention platforms like ExpertEase AI, AgentHub, CrewAI for simplifying workflows, and agent collaboration, but I wonder how stable it really is at scale. How are you handling monitoring, fallbacks, and version changes without touching code? Are these tools flexible enough when business logic evolves?\n\nMost importantly, what does working in production mean to you? Daily active users? Revenue impact? Low maintenance?

For example I use Workato as an IPaaS to integrate with 100s of tools as well as AI and have built more than 10 Automation projects. Because I solving for enterprise business problems and processes, the efficiency gains are high. Last year the near 10 projects have saved about 11k hours of manual work during 2025. \n\nSpecific example: Automating Co-Selling violations process between internal sales reps and our partners. \n\nInternal sales reps are meant to work closely with our partners to cosell our product (for specific deals). There are sales rules of engagement and coselling and breaking them constitute a violation. For example, a communication violation is not communicating with a partner on a deal. There has to be proof that a partner was communicated to and was part of the communication thread. Another violation is mislabelling a deal, saying the partner sourced it but they never did (they say this because it gives them more commissions) etc\n\nThe process for assigning violations to rep involves: identifying the violations and recording them for 1k reps, tracking how long a violation lasts before it expires, if they commit more than one violation in a given month it only counts as one, if they have one violation we give them direct feedback on the CRM, if they commit a second violation we email their manager, if they commit a third violation we involve HR. \n\n2 different people were involved near full time managing such process manually and with so many spreadsheets. All of this is now automated with one person spending few hours a month to prepare the data to be presented to leadership.",

The tricky thing with questionnaire answers is they can sound perfectly plausible but be subtly wrong, like claiming you have 24/7 monitoring when you actually check logs daily. Easy to miss in review because the language is so fluent.\n\nThe other thing is these answers become a documented record.

But I find AI due to its machine learning capabilities can automate a lot of repeated works and increase productivity and reduce costs for businesses. I know it will be possible, I just don't know if its possible now or is it already being done. For example, there are supermarket chains that have order invoicing and PO that are done daily by employees which is repeated everyday. There are accounting works that almost repeated every month. I have spoke to few AI agencies and they state they implement automation based on what the client needs. But the problem is most clients don't know they need it. I think that's where the market gap is. You show the problem and then sell the solution. I can bring on clients, I have done it before. But I don't know what to sell to them or have the product. If there are AI solutions that definitely helps businesses,its not just slop and most importantly scalable . I would really like to know what you guys are doing.",

That is because their work is full of exceptions, informal handoffs, and tribal knowledge. Invoicing and accounting sound repetitive, but they usually hide edge cases that humans quietly resolve. Agencies that succeed tend to start by mapping the workflow, identifying decision points, and separating “rules we understand” from “judgment we outsource to people.”\n\nThe scalable opportunities are usually boring things like data movement, reconciliation, validation, and alerts, not full end to end replacement of roles.
