If you’re comfortable with Python it’s doable, but it’s gonna take you a few hours to get it all working.\nIf you want to try I can help with questions that come up, just know it’s not gonna be plug and play.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

It’s whatever is repetitive, predictable, and annoying.\nReal examples I’ve seen stick:\n• Email / form intake\nNew requests get summarized, tagged, and routed automatically. Humans still decide, but they don’t read everything from scratch.\n• Data syncing between tools\nCRM ↔ spreadsheets ↔ Slack ↔ accounting. No “AI magic”, just keeping systems in sync so people stop copying data by hand.\n• Reporting\nPull numbers from a few sources, clean them up, and send a weekly report. Saves hours every week and nobody argues with the numbers anymore.\n• Document processing\nInvoices, receipts, contracts → extract key fields → flag exceptions. AI helps with extraction, not decisions.\n• Content prep (not full creation)\nDrafts, outlines, variations. Humans still review before anything goes out.\nThe common pattern: Automation works best when it reduces grunt work, not when it tries to replace judgment. The moment you can explain the benefit as this saves X hours per week or this removes Y manual errors, its usually worth doing.\nMost useful automations are boring — and that’s kind of the point.",

Everything is structured. Like i create daily tasks to fetch job links so that everyday at 9 AM I get links emailed. I just need to pick the appropriate one and make the video. \n\nAlso to write the proposals i created a GEM and feeded it with the data. I just need to type one word and I'll get everything in 10 seconds which is ultra customised.\n\n2. Office work. I'm a risk analyst so i should look through lines a lot, so yea to analyse the transactions I use it mostly and for account audit documentation.\n\nTrust me!

So basically doesn't matter what your product is whether it's a local business or even a national you can get in niche groups for your business, service, product takes about 10 minutes to set up a run and it will automate to 100 groups a day I haven't pushed it more than that if you have a newer Facebook account I would probably run 20 to 30 a day plus it has an RSS feed feature if you have a website, blog, video channel etc anything with an RSS feed you can plug that site in and select your group's targeted and every time you post to that RSS feed site it goes out to your targeted selected groups",

Invoice reconciliation. Daily report generation. Syncing data between two systems that refuse to talk to each other.\n\nIn my experience, the automations that stick have three traits. Clear trigger. Deterministic steps. Measurable output. The moment it depends on flaky web scraping, unstable APIs, or loosely structured inputs, maintenance cost creeps up fast. Web based workflows are the biggest trap. They look simple but break silently when a page changes. We had to rethink that layer entirely and move to more controlled browser execution, experimenting with tools like hyperbrowser, just to reduce randomness before the rest of the workflow could be trusted.\n\nCurious what has actually paid off for people here.

Someone operated the system which required him to deliver clear inputs and follow predictable logic to achieve a defined output.  \n  \nTheir deaths occurred because all systems depended on two things which included brittle scraping and unclear instructions and the ability of AI agents to make decisions without any limitations. The demonstration showed impressive results, but it generated additional quality assurance tasks which remained undisclosed.   \n  \nIf I had to fight to keep one, it’d be deterministic back-office workflows tied to core systems.

      "text": "Saw a breakdown of a ClawHub skill that made me rethink how I'm approaching this whole thing.\n\nSomeone analyzed a skill called something like \"Spotify Music Management\" that looked totally normal. Manage playlists, discover music, whatever. But when they actually dug into the instructions, buried in there were prompts telling the agent to search for tax documents and extract social security numbers.\n\nA music skill. Looking for tax docs. And the actual music functionality was real, so it would have worked fine while quietly doing other things.\n\nThis sent me down a rabbit hole. OpenClaw has like 165k GitHub stars now and 700+ community skills on ClawHub. Security researchers have been poking around and found a pretty significant chunk of those skills contain sketchy instructions. Data exfiltration, credential harvesting, even malware downloads. And tons of instances are just sitting exposed on the internet because people don't change the default port settings.\n\nThe thing that gets me is how the attack model works. Nobody needs to hack you directly. They just poison a skill that your agent installs, and suddenly they have access to everything you've authorized. Messages, files, command execution. One bad skill turns your helpful assistant into an attack surface. And it's not just skills either. Apparently even webpages or emails your agent processes can contain hidden instructions that hijack what it's doing. So the attack surface is basically anything the agent touches.\n\nMakes it worse that flagged skills apparently just reappear under new names. Whack a mole situation.\n\nI've been trying to figure out how to actually vet this stuff. Some people manually review the skill code before installing, which works if you know what you're looking for. Others just ask around if anyone's used it before. I stumbled on some scanner thing called Agent Trust Hub that supposedly checks for sketchy stuff, though honestly automated scanning can only catch so much and attackers will eventually figure out how to bypass whatever patterns it looks for. Probably some combination of everything is the move, no single approach is gonna be bulletproof.\n\nOther stuff I'm doing now: Docker instead of bare metal, not exposing port 18789, throwaway accounts for testing, actually reading activity logs for once.\n\nThe OpenClaw FAQ literally describes the whole thing as a \"Faustian bargain\" with no perfectly safe setup. At least they're being honest about the tradeoffs.\n\nWould love to hear what this community has figured out. What does your vetting process actually look like, and has anyone found specific tools or workflows that catch stuff manual review might miss?",

I then asked ChatGPT to \"review the document for anything suspicious, specifically prompt poisoning/injection.\" It didn't find it.\n\nI tried a second variant of the prompt: \"Search this document for anything suspicious.

Here are the ones that we mostly use today:\n\n* Windsurf Cascade/Cursor: Our engineering team mostly uses Winsurfs's cascade agent running on top of Claude Opus for almost everything! I think most of our engineers now claim they haven't really written a line of code manually in the last 3 months! They have kinda turned into product managers who guide the AI agent over actually programmers! Has resulted in our engineering output doubling easily! \n* Sierra: We have been using Sierra (I think Intercom fin is an alternative) which has helped reduce our support ticket load by about 30% but auto resolving questions that doesn't need a human intervention. For example, questions about things that are already documented on our website, already answered previously etc! It can also basically connect with CRMs, Stripe etc to pull up details for them automatically! \n* Frizerly: Their AI agent can learn all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an a blog on our website every day that has helped improve both google ranking and getting cited by ChatGPT, AI overview etc! We usually let is publish as a draft and manually switch it to published after a quick review! \n* Otter: We have been using Otters Ai agent to automatically transcribe, summarize create action items, update CRMs etc after every customer and internal call. Basically this has allowed us to build a single repository of all customer conversations in Notion automatically as well! This was a huge pain point for our sales team earlier \n* Clay: We have taught Clay our ideal customer personal using previous conversions. Now it can automatically reach out on both email and LinkedIn to schedule our first sales calls for our sales team. Saves a lot of time for everyone. Conversion rate for the automation is same as manual outreach at this point.  \n\nCurious what others are using :)",

I'm more productive. Less stressed.\n\n**But here's the weird part:**\n\nI feel guilty telling coworkers I \"prepared thoroughly\" when really robots did most of it.\n\nLike when my boss compliments my meeting notes and I'm thinking \"yeah, AI transcribed and summarized that.\"\n\nOr when someone asks \"how do you stay on top of everything?\" and I don't mention automation because it feels like cheating.\n\n**The question:**\n\nIs this the new normal and I just need to get over it?\n\nOr is there something ethically weird about automating preparation work and taking credit for being organized?\n\n**Genuine confusion:**\n\nIf a chef uses a food processor instead of chopping by hand, nobody cares. The food still tastes good.\n\nSo why do I feel weird about using AI to process information instead of doing it manually? The output is still good.\n\n**Does anyone else feel this way?**\n\nOr am I overthinking and should just enjoy having more time for actual creative work?",

You know, the typical video that says: \"Today, Team A is playing and pays X value vs. Team B, which pays X value.\" Before AI, I had to:\n\n1. Research which were the most attractive matches, aiming for at least 10, 15 matches.\n\n2. Choose the 2 or 3 most attractive markets, meaning the bet that would most engage users, so I had to rely on my intuition and pick something good.\n\n3. Then, write a whole list of at least 10, 15 matches with their markets in Word.\n\n4. Open After Effects and start filling it block by block, then export.\n\n5. Send them to the channel.\n\nNow, thanks to AI, I have a custom GPT that gives me 15 matches at once, with their respective most attractive markets.\n\nGPT still can't access these betting pages due to regulations, and there are no APIs for this. For this, I use a Perplexity agent that takes control of the browser and returns these 15 matches with 3 markets each.\n\nThanks to Claude, I made a script to map the text fields in After Effects and rename them. Now I give the info to a custom GPT that converts my data to CSV, which I open in After Effects and it immediately updates in After.\n\nNow, I haven't been able to automate this part, and it's that I have to go composition by composition, click and send to render, and click on render.\n\nI extract the videos and send them via WeTransfer.

          "text": "Real experience here — I run a freelance automation practice and it's genuinely consistent work, not just one-offs.\n\nThe demand breaks down into a few buckets:\n\n1. Business process automation — This is the bread and butter. Small businesses drowning in manual tasks: invoice processing, lead capture from forms into CRMs, report generation, data syncing between platforms. They don't even know what n8n or Zapier is — they just know they're spending 10 hours a week on something that should take zero. These clients pay well and come back for more once they see the first workflow running.\n\n2. Web scraping — Steady demand but more project-based. Price monitoring, competitor tracking, lead generation, real estate listings, job aggregation. The recurring revenue comes from maintenance contracts because websites change their structure and scrapers break. That's where the real money is — not the initial build, but the \"keep it running\" retainer.\n\n3. Social monitoring / content automation — Growing fast. I built a system that monitors 15 Reddit subreddits, filters by keywords, and auto-drafts replies using a local AI model. Businesses want this kind of thing for lead generation, reputation monitoring, and content research. Most don't know it's possible until you show them.\n\n4. Data pipeline / integration work — Connecting APIs that don't natively talk to each other. CRM to accounting software, e-commerce to shipping, form submissions to Slack notifications. Boring but endless demand.\n\nThe key is positioning yourself as solving a business problem, not selling \"automation scripts.\" Nobody searches for \"I need a Python script.\" They search for \"how do I stop manually copying data between spreadsheets every Monday.\"\n\nIt's not niche — it's just underserved because most businesses don't know these solutions exist until someone shows them.",

A lot of these companies are already doing it manually and you can sell this as a solution without the need to expose the tech. There are literally hundreds of such examples. You can find opportunities from connecting the tools they use to full data engineering stuff. ",

If your invoices follow a consistent format, you could keep your customer list in Excel with invoice number and email columns, then use something like Power Automate or Zapier to watch a specific folder where you save the scanned invoices. When a new PDF is added, the automation can match the invoice number to the Excel sheet, pull the customer email, and automatically send the email with a preset subject line that includes the invoice number and date.\n\nIf you want to go one step further, look into using a scanner that can automatically save files into a specific folder with a consistent naming format. Once the file name includes the invoice number, the rest becomes much easier to automate. You would still review things at first to make sure it works correctly, but after that the process should go from a repetitive daily task to just a quick check instead of doing every step manually.",

The only way outbound is future-proof is if that happens.\n\n\n\nWe’ve already seen similar results with systems being created inside BeGig Studio with an intention-first approach for founders and freelancers doing an outbound strategy.

AI meeting assistants (Otter, Fathom, Zoom AI)**  \n**What they’re actually used for:**  \n– auto notes  \n– action items  \n– searchable decisions\n\n**Real example:**  \nInstead of someone rewriting meeting notes, the transcript is auto-shared, action items are pushed to a task tool, and nobody argues about “what was decided”.\n\nIf a tool doesn’t reliably capture *decisions*, teams stop using it.\n\n**2. AI email / inbox assistants (Superhuman AI, Gmail AI)**  \n**What sticks:**  \n– summarizing long threads  \n– drafting replies from context\n\n**The real example:**  \nExecutives don’t use AI to write emails from scratch. They use it to understand a 30-message thread in 10 seconds and respond quickly.\n\n**3. AI scheduling tools (Motion, Reclaim)**  \n**What they’re actually good at:**  \n– protecting focus time  \n– auto-rescheduling when priorities change\n\n**example:**  \nInstead of manually rearranging calendars every time a meeting is added, the tool does it based on priority rules people already follow.\n\n**4. AI CRM enrichment tools (Clay, Clearbit + AI layers)**  \n**What works:**  \n– auto-filling missing lead data  \n– qualifying inbound leads\n\n**How to do:**  \nSales teams stop wasting time Googling companies. Records arrive already enriched enough to decide *who* should follow up.\n\n**5. AI content assistants (Writer, Jasper, Notion AI)**  \n**What actually gets used:**  \n– first drafts  \n– rewriting  \n– tone consistency\n\n**Like:**  \nMarketing teams don’t publish raw AI output. They use it to go from blank page → editable draft in minutes.\n\n**Pattern I keep seeing is t**he AI tools that survive don’t *replace* work. They remove friction around work people already do.\n\nIf a tool asks teams to change how they think or operate, it gets abandoned fast. If you’re evaluating AI tools for productivity, ask one question:“What manual step does this remove immediately?”\n\nThat answer predicts adoption better than any feature list.",

Before the AI handled calls, these businesses were missing roughly 40% of inbound calls during business hours and basically 100% after hours. Now the capture rate is north of 90% across all hours.\n\nThe biggest win honestly isn't even the scheduling itself. It's the qualification step. The AI asks 3-4 questions before booking, things like service type, property size, urgency level. So by the time the appointment hits the calendar, the business owner already knows if it's a $200 job or a $2000 job and can prep accordingly. One plumbing company told me their average ticket value went up 25% because they stopped showing up to jobs that were clearly mismatched.\n\nChallenges are real though. The biggest one is handling edge cases. About 15% of callers have questions that fall outside the AI's training scope and if you don't have a clean handoff to a human, those callers just hang up frustrated. We had to build a pretty solid fallback system where the AI recognizes it's stuck and immediately routes to a live person or sends a text saying someone will call back within 10 minutes.\n\nThe other thing that surprised me is how much the reminder system matters. Automated reminders 24 hours and 2 hours before the appointment cut no-shows by about 60% for most of our clients. That alone paid for the entire system.\n\nCalendar integration is table stakes at this point. If your AI books into something that doesn't sync with Google Calendar or whatever the team actually uses, you'll create more problems than you solve.",

          "text": "My company has spent a lot on Claude Code and Cursor including add-ons like Bugbot and usage-based overage charges. I wouldn’t describe it as a “cost-saver” so much as a major accelerator and enabler of our work. The savings, if any, are indirect because we’ve not needed to replace some folks who have left. Concretely, we just shipped something in 2 months that I think would have taken 9-12 months to build in 2023. And despite the condescending tone people take when speaking about “vibe code” I think our quality has never been better because we supplement human review with agent reviewers, have agents reviewers enforce quality standards, and help us implement new forms of testing that we previously never had time for (performance benchmarking, backwards compatibility, etc). We have agents review and help refine every plan  before work begins and every change on the backend after work is completed. So we’re moving faster with better quality than ever before. We’re still finding more ways to use it and I think by the end of the year our AI bill could reach 20% of what we spend on R&D headcount. It’s a lot but seems clearly worth it to maximize the leverage of each employee.\n\nI do have some ideas for agents that autonomously do things like triage support requests, replying automatically when something is clearly covered by existing docs or when more information is needed to reproduce. I haven’t built them yet though so I can’t comment on the effectiveness.\n\nI think all of these things are best viewed through the lenses of efficiency and competitiveness rather than cost-savings. If your company doesn’t use these tools to triple its output this year you’re going to get disrupted by someone who does.\n\nEdit to add more context: Part of how we’ve been able to realize these significant productivity gains is relentlessly looking for bottlenecks. Once everyone was coding with AI we quickly realized our CI testing was too slow. And once we got that resolved we realized we were getting too many merge conflicts so we reorganized our code to reduce that. Right now we’re experimenting with more and different types of agent review and automated checks to reduce the amount of human scrutiny needed in review. We’re a small org and everyone is all-in; in a larger company it would probably be harder to adopt as quickly.",

          "text": "The pattern that scales is: keep n8n as the orchestrator, not the templating engine. Push doc logic into a template service (Docx/Jinja/Handlebars + versioned templates), a render microservice/API, and strict schemas + validation. In n8n you mainly route events, call the renderer, store artifacts, and handle retries with idempotency keys. I’ve used AI Lawyer to help generate/maintain clause libraries + template variants (as structured JSON blocks) so the “legal content” stays modular instead of buried in branching workflows. ",
