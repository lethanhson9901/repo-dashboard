If you’re comfortable with Python it’s doable, but it’s gonna take you a few hours to get it all working.\nIf you want to try I can help with questions that come up, just know it’s not gonna be plug and play.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

I was tasked for content migration basically copy pasting research reports (McKinsey, Gartner style) to Hubspot. now I did not have any acces to api, or admin permission to install anything apart from python and VScode (From store).\n\ni automated the whole pipeline from gathering report docs and images from scattered SharePoint folders to creating a hubspot ready to paste HTML. I used GitHub copilot (had no choice,) free tier for coding.\n\nit used to take 6 hrs for doing 1 report. now I do 5 in one hour. saving hours and sometimes days of work. \n\nsimilarly I automated a PPT deck creation (80+slide) for sales people. with all kinds of different images. it collects images, reads the context to be pasted on each slide from a manifest .(this is created by python after reading docx, csv)\npastes everything from the title box, text box, images properly aligned with predefined styles. all under 20 minutes. \n\n\n\nwith these two automations I save about 4 Hours every day. sometimes I'm done for the day before lunch. my weekly hours are reduced to 20 now. while getting paid for 45.\n\nleaving me with time for learning more automations .\n\ni tried to showcase this to my manager here ( I work on contract) in hopes of getting more tools or a paid claude subscription but he showed no interest. so I keep learning since I have more free time now.\n\nBecause the feeling of building, connecting it and watching it all work. is something I keep chasing after.\n\ni wanted to post details here but I was unable to. would love to know where can I go from here. what should I learn enxt ? zapier. make  or n8n?",

          "text": "Not a lot has changed for us recently but that said, we have heavily used AI agents since last year and cant imaging working without them anymore. Here are the ones that we mostly use today:\n\n* Windsurf Cascade/Cursor: Our engineering team mostly uses Winsurfs's cascade agent running on top of Claude Opus for almost everything! I think most of our engineers now claim they haven't really written a line of code manually in the last 3 months! They have kinda turned into product managers who guide the AI agent over actually programmers! Has resulted in our engineering output doubling easily! \n* Sierra: We have been using Sierra (I think Intercom fin is an alternative) which has helped reduce our support ticket load by about 30% but auto resolving questions that doesn't need a human intervention. For example, questions about things that are already documented on our website, already answered previously etc! It can also basically connect with CRMs, Stripe etc to pull up details for them automatically! \n* Frizerly: Their AI agent can learn all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an a blog on our website every day that has helped improve both google ranking and getting cited by ChatGPT, AI overview etc! We usually let is publish as a draft and manually switch it to published after a quick review! \n* Otter: We have been using Otters Ai agent to automatically transcribe, summarize create action items, update CRMs etc after every customer and internal call. Basically this has allowed us to build a single repository of all customer conversations in Notion automatically as well! This was a huge pain point for our sales team earlier \n* Clay: We have taught Clay our ideal customer personal using previous conversions. Now it can automatically reach out on both email and LinkedIn to schedule our first sales calls for our sales team. Saves a lot of time for everyone. Conversion rate for the automation is same as manual outreach at this point.  \n\nCurious what others are using :)",

Invoice reconciliation. Daily report generation. Syncing data between two systems that refuse to talk to each other.\n\nIn my experience, the automations that stick have three traits. Clear trigger. Deterministic steps. Measurable output. The moment it depends on flaky web scraping, unstable APIs, or loosely structured inputs, maintenance cost creeps up fast. Web based workflows are the biggest trap. They look simple but break silently when a page changes. We had to rethink that layer entirely and move to more controlled browser execution, experimenting with tools like hyperbrowser, just to reduce randomness before the rest of the workflow could be trusted.\n\nCurious what has actually paid off for people here. What automation are you running daily that you would fight to keep if budget got cut? And which ones quietly died after the demo phase?",

It's insane how it can take a simple product image and create full blown photoshoots without actually changing the product details! You can also basically generate a start image and end image and turn this into a full video or reel using Google Veo 3 as well! Insane!\n* Similarly we're paying an agency for writing blogs and content for our website to improve our Google ranking! Since then we have been able to using AI tools like Frizerly to train AI on our business, product and search data to automatically create blogs on our website daily based on this! Results are comparable at this point! \n* Last but not least, every sales member was instructed to do a specific quota of cold outreach everyday from their linkedin and email to book sales calls daily! However our sales team hated this job again and we were finally able to automate the part till booking the sales call using tools like Clay! The key here though is still manually figuring out your ICP and messaging first before automating!",

Here's what I'd actually suggest instead of jumping into AI automation agencies (which everyone recommends but requires clients and sales skills you don't have yet):\n\nStart a faceless YouTube or TikTok channel. You don't need a camera, don't need to show your face. AI can generate scripts, images, voiceovers, even entire videos now. Pick a niche like scary stories, motivation, finance tips, or history facts. Post 1 video a day. YouTube pays through AdSense once you hit 1K subs + 4K watch hours.\n\nTo start for free: ChatGPT for scripts, CapCut for editing, Canva for thumbnails. There are also AI video generators that make the whole video from a single prompt if you want to skip editing entirely. I actually built one called Keyvello  because I got tired of the editing grind myself -- you can try it free if you want.\n\nDon't overthink it. Make your first video today. It'll be bad, that's fine. You learn by doing, not by watching courses. You're 18 and already looking for ways -- that puts you ahead of most people.\n\n",

Research which were the most attractive matches, aiming for at least 10, 15 matches.\n\n2. Choose the 2 or 3 most attractive markets, meaning the bet that would most engage users, so I had to rely on my intuition and pick something good.\n\n3. Then, write a whole list of at least 10, 15 matches with their markets in Word.\n\n4. Open After Effects and start filling it block by block, then export.\n\n5. Send them to the channel.\n\nNow, thanks to AI, I have a custom GPT that gives me 15 matches at once, with their respective most attractive markets.\n\nGPT still can't access these betting pages due to regulations, and there are no APIs for this. For this, I use a Perplexity agent that takes control of the browser and returns these 15 matches with 3 markets each.\n\nThanks to Claude, I made a script to map the text fields in After Effects and rename them. Now I give the info to a custom GPT that converts my data to CSV, which I open in After Effects and it immediately updates in After.\n\nNow, I haven't been able to automate this part, and it's that I have to go composition by composition, click and send to render, and click on render.\n\nI extract the videos and send them via WeTransfer.

We primarily use Clio but it is clunky at best because Clio bought one or two different Law Firm programs and tried to mash all the code together even though they don't work well with one another. Wherever there was throttling because of coding or bottlenecking due to overlapping program nonsense, I have used AI to build automation software that now turns my 60 plus hours per week of really hard work into 40 hours of mostly goofing around.\n\nHowever, I should note that I am also an IT professional and I can't imagine a lay person would be able to do what I've done. A little bit of know-how and a white swath of knowledge in the IT field and you can automate pretty much anything.\n\nBefore ai, I automated an entire government department out of jobs, including myself. I wrote a handful of ducky scripts to make my job easier, and as I kept going, I realized that more and more of my job could be done automatically. Eventually, it didn't require people and my boss noticed, sent it to hr, HR declared my entire department redundant, and then everyone in my department was let go. I didn't leave any documentation because I didn't expect to need it, but they never reached out to me for help with the apps/scripts that I wrote so I'm guessing they just hired one of their IT people to makes sense of it and train some of their pre-existing employees.\n\nMy current employer is not only impressed that I am automating so many of our processes, she has offered to pay me 25% of any program that I can replace through my own coding so if a program costs us $500 a month at the law firm and I can replace it with some tailored code for the firm specifically rather than an overarching all-encompassing program with a lot of features that we don't need, then I get an extra $125/mo for so long as they use the program, whether or not I am still with them. She also pays for my time that I practice and learn coding outside of regular office hours because the better I get at this, the more I can do to save the business loads of money.",

From what I’ve seen, the best wins come from automating routine communication tasks, like handling incoming inquiries, filtering notifications, or posting updates in channels for solo operators or small teams. The biggest headaches are almost always the deployment part: server setup, maintenance, and keeping things running 24/7. Most guides gloss over how much time you burn just on DevOps. In fact, that was the reason we built a product to skip all that and let you launch an OpenClaw agent on Telegram without touching servers or docker. Happy to share more if that’s useful, but the main lesson is: automation saves time, but only if you can actually get it running without endless setup.",

I wouldn’t describe it as a “cost-saver” so much as a major accelerator and enabler of our work. The savings, if any, are indirect because we’ve not needed to replace some folks who have left. Concretely, we just shipped something in 2 months that I think would have taken 9-12 months to build in 2023. And despite the condescending tone people take when speaking about “vibe code” I think our quality has never been better because we supplement human review with agent reviewers, have agents reviewers enforce quality standards, and help us implement new forms of testing that we previously never had time for (performance benchmarking, backwards compatibility, etc). We have agents review and help refine every plan  before work begins and every change on the backend after work is completed. So we’re moving faster with better quality than ever before. We’re still finding more ways to use it and I think by the end of the year our AI bill could reach 20% of what we spend on R&D headcount. It’s a lot but seems clearly worth it to maximize the leverage of each employee.\n\nI do have some ideas for agents that autonomously do things like triage support requests, replying automatically when something is clearly covered by existing docs or when more information is needed to reproduce. I haven’t built them yet though so I can’t comment on the effectiveness.\n\nI think all of these things are best viewed through the lenses of efficiency and competitiveness rather than cost-savings. If your company doesn’t use these tools to triple its output this year you’re going to get disrupted by someone who does.\n\nEdit to add more context: Part of how we’ve been able to realize these significant productivity gains is relentlessly looking for bottlenecks. Once everyone was coding with AI we quickly realized our CI testing was too slow. And once we got that resolved we realized we were getting too many merge conflicts so we reorganized our code to reduce that. Right now we’re experimenting with more and different types of agent review and automated checks to reduce the amount of human scrutiny needed in review. We’re a small org and everyone is all-in; in a larger company it would probably be harder to adopt as quickly.",

Make vs n8n is honestly preference - Make has better UI but n8n is more flexible once you get comfortable. The real breakthrough happens when you stop trying to automate everything and focus on one repetitive task that's actually costing you hours each week. I went through the same confusion when I started, was bouncing between Zapier and Make for months until I realized the tool matters way less than picking the right workflow. Now I use Make for complex stuff, but honestly most of my time savings come from AI tools like Brew for email sequences, Gamma for quick decks, and Cursor when I need light scripting.",

Claude nailed them all on the first try and I fixed the image to exclude any giveaways and only include the images of the captchas themselves. \n\nThis was his response to how he did it:\n\nI simply looked at each image carefully and read the characters displayed in each box. Here's what I did for each:\n\n1. I visually parsed each of the 9 boxes one by one, left to right, top to bottom.\n2. Each box contained a mix of **numbers and capital letters** in a handwritten/distressed font on a speckled white background.\n3. Some boxes had **diagonal lines crossing through them** (a common captcha anti-bot technique to make automated reading harder), but since I can visually interpret images, I was able to see through those lines and identify the characters underneath.\n4. The trickiest characters were ones that can look similar, like:\n   * **U vs V** (e.g., in \"VHQU\" and \"UGL\")\n   * **Z vs 2** (e.g., the Z in \"4LZ3G\")\n   * **P vs D** (making sure to distinguish between them)\n   * Lowercase mixed in, like the **p** in \"2KJEp\" — I normalized it to **P**\n\nEssentially, I used my vision capabilities to interpret the image as a human would — recognizing letterforms despite the noise, distortion, and crossing lines layered over the text.\n\n\\- Claude",

I would just hook in Claude API if I was building an automation as opposed to a training a model to solve these specific style of captcha. I understand the value in a custom training model.

      "text": "We all know that there are a lot of AI tools in the market right now, but in real business environments, there is only a small subset actually sticks.\n\nHere are some AI tools I use *consistently* for productivity, with the exact use case and not the marketing pitch also just wanting to help every serious business owners who are stuck in between these tools.\n\n**1. AI meeting assistants (Otter, Fathom, Zoom AI)**  \n**What they’re actually used for:**  \n– auto notes  \n– action items  \n– searchable decisions\n\n**Real example:**  \nInstead of someone rewriting meeting notes, the transcript is auto-shared, action items are pushed to a task tool, and nobody argues about “what was decided”.\n\nIf a tool doesn’t reliably capture *decisions*, teams stop using it.\n\n**2. AI email / inbox assistants (Superhuman AI, Gmail AI)**  \n**What sticks:**  \n– summarizing long threads  \n– drafting replies from context\n\n**The real example:**  \nExecutives don’t use AI to write emails from scratch. They use it to understand a 30-message thread in 10 seconds and respond quickly.\n\n**3. AI scheduling tools (Motion, Reclaim)**  \n**What they’re actually good at:**  \n– protecting focus time  \n– auto-rescheduling when priorities change\n\n**example:**  \nInstead of manually rearranging calendars every time a meeting is added, the tool does it based on priority rules people already follow.\n\n**4. AI CRM enrichment tools (Clay, Clearbit + AI layers)**  \n**What works:**  \n– auto-filling missing lead data  \n– qualifying inbound leads\n\n**How to do:**  \nSales teams stop wasting time Googling companies. Records arrive already enriched enough to decide *who* should follow up.\n\n**5. AI content assistants (Writer, Jasper, Notion AI)**  \n**What actually gets used:**  \n– first drafts  \n– rewriting  \n– tone consistency\n\n**Like:**  \nMarketing teams don’t publish raw AI output. They use it to go from blank page → editable draft in minutes.\n\n**Pattern I keep seeing is t**he AI tools that survive don’t *replace* work. They remove friction around work people already do.\n\nIf a tool asks teams to change how they think or operate, it gets abandoned fast. If you’re evaluating AI tools for productivity, ask one question:“What manual step does this remove immediately?”\n\nThat answer predicts adoption better than any feature list.",

Making sure to collect data + route agents depending on TYPE of call. Finding phone numbers through online scraping.\n\nEnded up taking months to build, esp. when friends started using it I ran into more edge cases\n\nAnyway, I got down the cost per call enough to start using it on daily stuff like restaurants, doctors, wrong charges, and yeah.\n\nIm done making annoying ass phone calls. Legit never going back. \n\nIf I see a gap with the tool, I just fix it and boom that phone call is forever automated in the future.",

AI emails get one chance to prove there is a real person behind the AI through a video call; if not, we move on to find our ideal client elsewhere. Pursuing clients who use AI usually just leads us down a road to a scam attempt. I only give the benefit of the doubt because some may be using English as a second language and understand why they might use AI, but it's usually a scammer. The bottom line is that if you insist on using AI like this, please know that you are blocking yourself off from many businesses that are getting wise to scammers using AI to scale their targeting. I expect that I may get downvoted and gets some hate for this comment, but... I hate scammers and have no time for that BS.",

I’m tired of repeating the same instructions every three prompts because it \"forgets\" the constraints or just stops using the source of truth I provided. It’s exhausting having to babysit a tool that’s supposed to save time.\n\nI’m looking for a way to make my configs, logs, and docs a permanent source of truth for the AI. Are you guys using specific tools, local RAG, or is the \"AI Agent\" thing the only real fix? Or are we all just going back to reading manuals by hand because these models can’t be trusted for 10 minutes without making shit up? How do you actually solve this?

Looking for practical suggestions on the best approach.\n\n**The core workflow I want to automate:**\n\nOver the years, we have 100+ clients and 200+ completed projects. The goal is to use that archive intelligently to generate better, more consistent output going forward. \n\nExpecting to have around 50-100 projects in 2026.\n\n**Specifically:**\n\n**Proposals:** New proposals should reference past reports and scopes (more or less standardized) submitted for that client, so there's no conflicting information across engagements.\n\n**Consultancy reports:** These are the most tedious. Each report (\\~200 slides) is generated from the scope of work, a bit of client-provided information, and market research (we used ChatGPT for this, open to any LLM). I'd like to produce the content in Google Docs first, to be able to make edits and review, then convert to Google Slides.\n\n**Style and POV consistency:** There are specific nuances in how reports should be written (particular POV, framing, tone) that need to be applied reliably every time, not dependent on whoever is doing the work that day. Ideally we want to be able to add some tables and images in the slides too.\n\nNot looking for anything too extreme, just a reliable system that holds institutional knowledge, applies consistent rules, and saves significant time.\n\nWhat tools or architectures would you recommend?",

You review it, then a script converts the structured doc into a full Google Slides deck automatically (Docs API → Slides API). \n\n\nThe key part is adding a fixed “writing rulebook” prompt so tone/POV stays consistent every time. You can also plug search APIs for market data and auto-generate charts/tables. \n\nStart small: ingest ~20 projects and automate one section + proposal before scaling to full reports.\n\nDM me if you want help on implementation",

Usually a few rounds of this produces more consistent output.  \n\\- Then a final automation that turns Doc -> Slides\n\nClaude Code/Cowork can work like this, or N8N for more repeatability.",

Full turnaround under 5 minutes for a first draft. The manual work then is reviewing the draft and adjusting pricing. Saved our team about 3 hours per proposal once we set it up.

That's where quality breaks down because it requires judgment, not just information retrieval. What's worked in similar projects:\n\nDecompose by section type. A 200-slide deck has maybe 6-8 distinct content types (exec summary, market analysis, competitive landscape, recommendations, etc.). Some are highly automatable (methodology, company background). Others need more human input (final recommendations). Treat them differently.\n\nThe research to analysis step is a good place to focus. I'm assuming you do your own market research, or maybe AI-assisted. The trick is transforming the research into structured, client-ready sections that follow your specific framing and don't require heavy editing. That's a repeatability problem.\n\nStyle consistency needs systematic review, not just prompts. One pass through a style guide doesn't cut it at 200 slides. Build in automated review passes that check against your rules—or you'll still have the \"depends on who's working that day\" problem.\n\nWe've worked on automating pieces of similar decks. Not the whole thing, but specific sections where the structure is predictable. Happy to share what worked if useful, we can connect on DM.",

Everything is tokenized (client name, dates, metrics, chart data) via text fields you can find/replace.\n\n2. **Data extraction** - whatever your source is (client interviews, research docs, CRM), extract and structure the relevant data into a consistent JSON/spreadsheet format first. This is usually the most manual step but you can add AI here to help normalize unstructured input.\n\n3. **Generation** - Google Slides API allows you to copy a presentation and then do batch updates to replace placeholder text and inject chart data. The Slides API `batchUpdate` call is what you want - you can replace all instances of {{client_name}} across all slides in one call.\n\nFor 200+ slides this is much more reliable than trying to build slides from scratch programmatically - you maintain design control in the template and just inject content.\n\nWhat's your current data source for the content that goes into the slides?
