      "text": "Over the past year, LinkedIn restricted my account three separate times.\n\nFirst restriction was obvious - I got greedy and sent 180 invites in 3 days, so deserved it. But the second and third times I thought I was being careful. Stayed under 100/week, used delays, didn't run campaigns at night… still got flagged.\n\nI studied what actually triggers restrictions beyond the stuffs everyone talks about. Here's what I found:\n\nPending invite ratio must be low. I had 420 pending requests, and it’s a lot. If your pending/total sent ratio is over 30%, LinkedIn sees you as low-quality. Now I auto-withdraw anything older than 21 days.\n\nMessages must be diverse.  I was rotating 3 templates thinking that was enough. All had the same structure, greeting + pain point + question. Linkedin is doing some kind of pattern matching. I switched to 7 completely different formats (some start with questions, some with observations, one is literally just 2 sentences).\n\nProfile must look proportional. I had 8 skills and 240 connections, which is a bit strange for someone who was sending 400 invites a month. So I added new skills,  got 5 recommendations, joined 3 more new groups, rewrote my experience, added new posts for 2 weeks, filled in featured section. \n\nPeople consume content. Not only your content is important, but also the content you as a real person consume on Linkedin. I only logged in to send invites. Real users browse, react on posts and comment. I did it manually for a week and then added auto-likes (15-25 daily) and I manually comment 3-4 times per week on target audience posts.\n\nSince then I’ve had no restrictions. My acceptance rate went from 32% to 54% and I'm actually sending fewer invites but getting better conversations. So slowing down and looking more real got me better results than trying to maximize volume.\n\n",

Replacing humans with LLMs that have the same unpredictability makes little sense.\n\nAt that point I would actually prefer the humans because they have the ability to learn, while an LLM has to be retrained. You can also program humans with UI and log messages so they follow instructions reliably. Although it's not an exact science, but I had some successes.",

All I've got is that I guess OpenClaw is the easiest and quickest way to get an agent up and running and contributed to a boom, I guess, and they used to have similar names? Because it doesn't seem like a natural fit at all.\n\nHaving agents corralled off in an environment to iteratively imitate a community is kinda funny. It's meaningless drivel and I don't believe the hype, but conceptually it entertains me. The part that loses me is that OpenClaw is an agent framework specifically designed to be able to interact locally with an operating system and user data. There is absolutely no part of \"live in this online community, read threads and reply\" that needs access to an OS, or (god help you) someone's personal files. That a program that by default is a rogue superuser on a machine became the most common tool to interact with MoltBook is ridiculous and it seems weird to me that that's not getting pointed out much.\n\nLiterally any isolated agent in a cloud service would be a better way to connect, but I guess there's more overhead in getting that running or something?",

A lot of data centres currently offset loans against a future sell on value of the GPUs. \n- data centres are often seen as a future investment - e.g. if the company went down, the physical data centre, the wires in the ground etc are still a useful asset. \n- Solar storms seem to offer a threat that would be not present in a traditional data centre, and might increase hardware failure rates over time. \n\nI don’t know if the economics of the solar power and potential for heat dissipation outweigh these significantly, but it seems very wasteful unless the expected shelf life of space data centres is some how longer. It feels like these would be sent up and then just left to die ands replaced with others. \n\nI know xAI had some huge fights over the gas turbines they needed to install to fuel their expedited data centre builds, so maybe energy generation is something that musk and others are especially focused on as they try to scale.",

However cooling is actually a bigger challenge than on ground since radiation is the only outlet.\n\nHowever, that’s all prior art.\n\nStarlink V3 supposedly has 60m wingspan with 7m to 8m base. I would say about 400 sq meter of solar panels, with 120kw power and cooling system. I think it’s safe to say it can handle 5x B200 system (each with 8x B200 and needs 15kw total) with 2t satellite weight.\n\nThe question is cost. Let’s say it cost 0.10/kwh on land, so the B200 system costs $1.5 per hour, $36/day. Assuming lifespan of 5 years, that’s $13k/year, 65k for five years. Running five will cost $328k over five years.\n\nAssuming launch cost of $50 per kg (some say $100, some say $10 to $20 eventually)with starship, a 2t satellite will cost $100k to launch. Seems to have a big saving comparing to the $328k, not counting the operational costs and residual values",

I’m using Atlas because it’s easy to iterate in the Playground and via the API (I wired it into an n8n workflow).\n\n**And here is the exact prompt I used:**\n\n*Prompt: A professional 3x3 grid layout of 9 high-quality portrait photos featuring a consistent character of a stunning young East Asian woman with long wavy dark hair and small silver earrings, wearing a black strapless tube top. Each grid cell shows a distinct and highly differentiated facial expression to ensure no repetition.*\n\n*The 9 expressions are:*\n\n1. *Top Row: \\[Gentle wink with a subtle smile\\] | \\[Wide teeth-showing joyful grin\\] | \\[Angry scowl with furrowed brows\\].*\n2. *Middle Row: \\[Playful wink with a cheeky tongue-out\\] | \\[Bursted loud laughter with closed eyes\\] | \\[Disgusted face with a wrinkled nose\\].*\n3. *Bottom Row: \\[Naughty side-view with tongue sticking out\\] | \\[Ecstatic head-tilted laughter\\] | \\[Depressed downward gaze with a sad pout\\].*\n\n*Technical Settings: Clean solid light grey background, soft studio high-key lighting, ultra-realistic skin texture with visible pores, 8k resolution, cinematic photography, shot on 85mm lens, f/1.8, hyper-detailed, masterpiece, photorealistic.”*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0mb5gotrdphg1.jpg?width=747&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da1c25184d716e9bee8c811c44df1e6675b427c4\n\n**A couple practical notes:**\n\n* If the first result isn't exactly what you’re looking for, just run it for a few more rounds.\n* The biggest win for me is having the “style/character DNA” captured in JSON so I’m not rewriting the same description every time.\n\nI turned this into an n8n workflow and used it for a small portrait “style match” service to a few people on IG. They give me a reference image, I generate a batch in the same style, pick the best set, deliver.\n\nHonestly, in this era, making money with AI feels *way too easy* if you can package a repeatable workflow:)",

For things like content, Meta, influencers, things are pretty easy as there are platforms that aggregate all the data and make it easy to view.\n\nWhen it comes to the impact of marketing campaigns on product adoption, however, I find myself struggling. Most data related to adoption metrics, subscription changes, user behaviour, etc. are all data that needs to be exported from the database (Postgres) using SQL.\n\nThe current method to get this data involves asking devs to write SQL, or using LLMs to create SQL (nearly always wrong). I try to learn some SQL as well, but find it hard to find time as I am a family man since recently.\n\nI have noticed that some people use ai tools to bypass the need for SQL and interact with data directly. I don't mean the traditional BI tools like PowerBI and Tableau, but less popular tools like TalkBI. The team thinks it is a risk to connect our database to such tools and so far not much is happening. I am running out of options here. Can you please help me figure out any alternative solutions?",

Once you identify those, you can version control the SQL, have devs sign off once, and then marketing just looks at auto-updated spreadsheets.\n\nFor ad-hoc questions, we use a combo approach: marketing describes what they want in plain english, an LLM generates a candidate query, but it runs against a staging copy first and gets human review before touching real data. The LLM is surprisingly good at modifying existing working queries but terrible at writing complex ones from scratch.\n\nThe security concern is valid - never give an external tool direct prod access. Read-only replica plus workflow automation is the safe path.",

The 'doubled sales' phenomenon usually isn't about the AI's closing skills but rather it's about solving the **Lead Decay Gap**.\n\nMost people don't realize that lead response at the 5-minute mark is 10x more effective than at 30 minutes. By using an assistant for the 'Inbound + Qualification' layer, you're essentially fixing a revenue killer.\n\nTo give some data-driven context for those skeptical about the 'robotic' feel:\n\n* **The Nuance:** The best results come when the AI handles the *administrative* friction (FAQs, booking) rather than trying to mimic a human closer.\n* **The Tech Signal:** Modern LLM-based voice engines have dropped latency to sub-second levels, which is why customers 'don't mind' the frustration of waiting on hold is higher than the friction of talking to a clear AI.\n* **The Filter:** Having the AI tag 'high-intent' vs 'tire-kickers' in the call summaries allows your human team to actually do the deep work they were hired for.\n\n**One tip for your setup:** If you aren't already, try linking the call summaries directly into your CRM via webhook.

We have since then moved to a bunch of dedicated tools inside our company for various tasks we used to have N8N do! Here are the ones that ended up working better\n\n* Outbound marketing: We earlier had an N8N automation but now we have taught Clay our ideal customer personal using previous conversions. Now it can automatically reach out on both email and LinkedIn to schedule our first sales calls for our sales team. Saves a lot of time for everyone. Conversion rate for the automation is same as manual outreach at this point\n* Meeting notes and action items: Again we tried setting up an automaton using N8N but since then moved to use specific tools like Otter to transcribes everything. It can also create action items, assign owners, update CRM, salesforce etc! You can even connect it to gamma to create after call presentations automatically\n* Blogs: We had an automation using N8N for both and writing blogs and content for our website to improve our Google ranking! Since then we have been able to using AI tools like Frizerly to train AI on our business, product and search data to automatically create blogs on our website daily based on this! Results are much better since it's able to self improve based on google results now!\n\nThat's all I can think of rn! Curious what other tools others are using :)",

The key insight is that early stage startups often over-automate.\n\nFor customer service automation, look at dedicated AI chatbot platforms that handle natural language out of the box - they're much more reliable than chaining together multiple APIs.\n\nFor social media, specialized scheduling tools with AI content generation are beating general-purpose automation because they understand platform-specific requirements.\n\nThe real opportunity I'm seeing is AI-powered vertical solutions. Instead of connecting 5 different APIs, you get one platform that understands your specific workflow (e-commerce, consulting, etc.).\n\nMy advice: Start with the 2-3 workflows that actually save you 10+ hours per week. Use the simplest tool that works for those specific cases. You can always upgrade later, but you can't get back the time lost over-engineering automation.\n\nThe maintenance overhead of managing multiple specialized tools often exceeds the benefits unless you're at scale.",

It would then ping you multiple time to day saying \"hey, do you have time to go over your new items\", it would then ask you intelligent questions, and it would know that you have to buy a birthday present for your sister by next Tuesday, and tax needs to be filed that's fine and ages but you do need to talk to your old employer about etc. etc.\n\nThen it would just know about habits you wanted to develop in the morning, or the evening or certain work things, your schedule, and it would just tell you \"oh, you need to do this\". It would have plenty of time in advance and use (effective) strategies (that it could research) on how to make it most likely you will take the first step on your taxes, and for things like hobbies, if you wanted to learn six things, it would probably start you on, e.g. 5 minutes piano on Monday, 5 minutes guitar on Tuesday, 5 minutes learning Welsh on Wednesday etc, and slowly ramp up the time so habit becomes second nature without ever feeling like work. And then when you get to the point where you doing 3 things every morning for 20 minutes, then the other 3 the next day, and it's starting to get too much, you can just drop one like that, or have a conversation about which one to drop.\n\nIt's a little bit of work, but it feels very doable right now...",

The \"too complex vs too simple\" thing is SO real.\n\nI've tried building something similar and here's what I've learned - the hard way:\n\nThe voice dump part? That's actually the easiest piece. You can do that right now with tools like Notion AI or even just voice memos that get transcribed. The hard part is the intelligence layer you're talking about - the system that actually KNOWS the difference between \"tax stuff that's annoying but I have time\" vs \"sister's birthday is Tuesday and I haven't even thought about it.\"\n\nWhat's worked better for me than trying to build one perfect system is accepting that my ADHD brain needs different scaffolding at different times. Sometimes I'm in hyperfocus mode and can handle complexity. Other times I literally can't remember if I ate lunch.\n\nThe habit stacking thing you mentioned (5 min piano Monday, 5 min guitar Tuesday) - that's actually pretty close to what I do with clients. But here's the catch: the system can't be smarter than you on your worst brain day. If it requires you to review and categorize stuff when you're already overwhelmed, you won't use it.\n\nWhat's actually been working is using AI for the triage part - like, I'll dump everything into a voice note, and then I have a simple prompt that sorts it into \"urgent/time-sensitive,\" \"want to do eventually,\" and \"nice idea but probably never happening.\" That last category is KEY because it gets all the guilt-inducing stuff out of my face.\n\nFor the habit ramping - totally doable, but you need external accountability or the system will just become another thing you ignore. I've found that works better with a human check-in (even async) than trying to make AI nag you effectively.\n\nAre you trying to build this for yourself or thinking bigger? Because the individual version is way more achievable than trying to make something that works for all ADHD brains (we're all chaotic in our own special ways lol).",

If you strip the language away, this looks very similar to task marketplaces that already exist, just with an algorithm doing the matching instead of a human. What feels different is the framing of people as a “layer” rather than as agents with judgment and choice.\n\nThe risk I see is not that AI delegates work, that already happens, but that responsibility and context get abstracted away. When a human assigns a task, there is usually some shared understanding of consequences and quality. When an agent does it, that accountability can get fuzzy fast. Whether this becomes dystopian or just another weird labor market experiment probably depends on how much agency and transparency the humans on the other side actually retain.",

I'm not entirely convinced on it.\n\nRight now it's much more effective to just hire capable people and scale them instead at the middle stage I'm talking about.

Perhaps AI is useless for \"the $1M-$5M business operator,\", or perhaps just for your specific use case scenario at this time. \n\nThis is likely a workflow issue for your specific situation. Not a true indication of AI viability at that level of structure. \n\nSince every business is different, and ever busines builder is different, every AI use case will likely be different as well. Hell, I made the top 3% of usage on ChatGPT as a soloist last year. I've done over 60k pages worth of material in the last three years, and I am not even using it to write these responses. :)\n\nSo it just truly matters what you are using it for, what your workflows and your specific needs are like. If you already have a well-defined workflow, have eliminated unnecessary tasks, and have streamlined before using AI, then yeah, it might not help you as much.\n\nI would still wager there are steps that could still be more optimal or enhanced through the use of AI that could, in fact, be implemented. You simply might not be implementing those types of tasks yet. \n\nThere will always be tradeoff points for hiring vs using a new tool. Whether you are talking AI or a new video editor, someone has to take time to learn the new tool before becoming proficient with it. That's the nature of the beast. So yes, there will always be a bit of a back and forth on this concept of \"easier to onboard new staff\" than to revamp your entire workflow. \n\nPersonally, when it comes to AI, I actually slow down at times because of issues such as AI slop. Not all AI usage has to be ultr-fast, redundant, crap. So there must be a balance even with AI.\n\nAs for \"TL;DR Someone needs to build boring, focused AI tooling for the $1M–$5M operator, we're the most underserved market in tech.\"\n\nYou could always build this. This is often how things get started. You are the best person to know what you are looking for. Many of the solutions I have developed over the years (4 decades of Dev Work), have almost always been custom solutions that I needed. There's a bit of a Dev roadmap that makes life a lot easier in the process, but many large-scale companies started as a single software tool. \n\nMany of these tools started as fixes to problems, often recurring problems. They were fixed, but often never meant to become products in the first place. \n\nWhat’s different now is the scope of what’s expected. You’re not just writing code anymore. You’re juggling systems, automation, testing, deployment, infra, security, and now AI on top of all of that. None of that is wrong, but the tooling landscape feels polarized. You either get lightweight hacker tools or massive enterprise platforms that assume layers of staff and process.\n\nThe $1M–$5M operator is stuck in the middle. They don’t need flashy innovation. They need boring, opinionated tools that reduce friction and cognitive load, standardize the obvious stuff, and let people focus on the work. “Boring” is kind of the point, and calm systems beat clever ones when you’re trying to run an actual business.\n\nIf you’re already operating in that space, you’re probably in a better position than most vendors to assemble something focused that actually reduces friction instead of adding another platform to manage.\n\nAs a developer, it could take me months to fully flesh out the industry that you are in ona level that would truly \"impact that market sector\". I wrote custom call center software for years; that's a highly specific industry. But I was in that industry to begin with. You have the built-in experience, knowledge, and understanding of your needs better than an outside developer would. \n\nIf you were to build the framework, based on the needs and functions that you required, then you could hand that off to developers and have it built.",

      "text": "Everyone is excited about AI voice agents right now.\n\n\n\nIn 2026, you can spin up an AI caller in a weekend. Connect Twilio, plug in a voice model, upload a lead list, and suddenly you’re “automating outbound.”\n\n\n\nIt sounds efficient.\n\n\n\nBut before you do that, there’s something most founders completely ignore: outbound phone calls are heavily regulated.\n\n\n\nNot “lightly suggested.” Regulated.\n\n\n\nIn the U.S., the TCPA (Telephone Consumer Protection Act) restricts automated calls, especially when using prerecorded or artificial voices.\n\n\n\nIf your AI voice calls someone without prior express written consent, you’re exposed.\n\n\n\nAnd “they filled out a form once” is usually not enough.\n\n\n\nHere’s what that actually means:\n\n\n\n* you need clear, documented consent specifically agreeing to receive automated calls\n* you need proof of when and how that consent was given\n* you need to respect Do Not Call lists (both federal and internal)\n* you need proper opt-out mechanisms\n* you need to understand state-level call recording laws\n\n\n\n\n\nEach violation can cost thousands of dollars per call.\n\n\n\nNot per campaign. Per call.\n\n\n\nAnd it’s not just the U.S.\n\n\n\nGDPR in Europe, CASL in Canada, PECR in the UK — they all have strict rules around automated communications and consent.\n\n\n\nThe technology is easy.\n\n\n\nCompliance is not.\n\n\n\nI’m not saying don’t use AI voice.\n\n\n\nI’m saying: if you’re going to automate outbound calls, make sure compliance is part of the architecture — not an afterthought.\n\n\n\nSometimes the smartest automation decision is not automating at all.\n\n\n\nIf you’re in trades business and unsure whether your setup is compliant, I can help you think it through before it becomes an expensive lesson.",
