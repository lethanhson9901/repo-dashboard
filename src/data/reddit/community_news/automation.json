If you’re comfortable with Python it’s doable, but it’s gonna take you a few hours to get it all working.\nIf you want to try I can help with questions that come up, just know it’s not gonna be plug and play.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

          "text": "Not a lot has changed for us recently but that said, we have heavily used AI agents since last year and cant imaging working without them anymore. Here are the ones that we mostly use today:\n\n* Windsurf Cascade/Cursor: Our engineering team mostly uses Winsurfs's cascade agent running on top of Claude Opus for almost everything! I think most of our engineers now claim they haven't really written a line of code manually in the last 3 months! They have kinda turned into product managers who guide the AI agent over actually programmers! Has resulted in our engineering output doubling easily! \n* Sierra: We have been using Sierra (I think Intercom fin is an alternative) which has helped reduce our support ticket load by about 30% but auto resolving questions that doesn't need a human intervention. For example, questions about things that are already documented on our website, already answered previously etc! It can also basically connect with CRMs, Stripe etc to pull up details for them automatically! \n* Frizerly: Their AI agent can learn all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an a blog on our website every day that has helped improve both google ranking and getting cited by ChatGPT, AI overview etc! We usually let is publish as a draft and manually switch it to published after a quick review! \n* Otter: We have been using Otters Ai agent to automatically transcribe, summarize create action items, update CRMs etc after every customer and internal call. Basically this has allowed us to build a single repository of all customer conversations in Notion automatically as well! This was a huge pain point for our sales team earlier \n* Clay: We have taught Clay our ideal customer personal using previous conversions. Now it can automatically reach out on both email and LinkedIn to schedule our first sales calls for our sales team. Saves a lot of time for everyone. Conversion rate for the automation is same as manual outreach at this point.  \n\nCurious what others are using :)",

Invoice reconciliation. Daily report generation. Syncing data between two systems that refuse to talk to each other.\n\nIn my experience, the automations that stick have three traits. Clear trigger. Deterministic steps. Measurable output. The moment it depends on flaky web scraping, unstable APIs, or loosely structured inputs, maintenance cost creeps up fast. Web based workflows are the biggest trap. They look simple but break silently when a page changes. We had to rethink that layer entirely and move to more controlled browser execution, experimenting with tools like hyperbrowser, just to reduce randomness before the rest of the workflow could be trusted.\n\nCurious what has actually paid off for people here. What automation are you running daily that you would fight to keep if budget got cut? And which ones quietly died after the demo phase?",

You can also basically generate a start image and end image and turn this into a full video or reel using Google Veo 3 as well! Insane!\n* Similarly we're paying an agency for writing blogs and content for our website to improve our Google ranking! Since then we have been able to using AI tools like Frizerly to train AI on our business, product and search data to automatically create blogs on our website daily based on this! Results are comparable at this point! \n* Last but not least, every sales member was instructed to do a specific quota of cold outreach everyday from their linkedin and email to book sales calls daily! However our sales team hated this job again and we were finally able to automate the part till booking the sales call using tools like Clay!

Most were net 30 or 60 but sometimes would be some oddly specific that as hard for AI to scrape like net 45 business days after the submission of the invoice\n\nTerms of deal varied significantly also in ways that could cause errors with AI. Most deals just had a single rate but sometimes would use a table to break down that rate into each individual element which we don’t need extracted but AI would do it. It was hard to cover all the issues with specific prompt modifications. Just easier to have someone review and confirm everything.",

Someone operated the system which required him to deliver clear inputs and follow predictable logic to achieve a defined output.  \n  \nTheir deaths occurred because all systems depended on two things which included brittle scraping and unclear instructions and the ability of AI agents to make decisions without any limitations.

You know, the typical video that says: \"Today, Team A is playing and pays X value vs. Team B, which pays X value.\" Before AI, I had to:\n\n1. Research which were the most attractive matches, aiming for at least 10, 15 matches.\n\n2. Choose the 2 or 3 most attractive markets, meaning the bet that would most engage users, so I had to rely on my intuition and pick something good.\n\n3. Then, write a whole list of at least 10, 15 matches with their markets in Word.\n\n4. Open After Effects and start filling it block by block, then export.\n\n5. Send them to the channel.\n\nNow, thanks to AI, I have a custom GPT that gives me 15 matches at once, with their respective most attractive markets.\n\nGPT still can't access these betting pages due to regulations, and there are no APIs for this. For this, I use a Perplexity agent that takes control of the browser and returns these 15 matches with 3 markets each.\n\nThanks to Claude, I made a script to map the text fields in After Effects and rename them. Now I give the info to a custom GPT that converts my data to CSV, which I open in After Effects and it immediately updates in After.\n\nNow, I haven't been able to automate this part, and it's that I have to go composition by composition, click and send to render, and click on render.\n\nI extract the videos and send them via WeTransfer.

Totally niche, nobody asked for it, and it took longer to design than the manual version ever would have.\n\nBut it ended up surfacing patterns no one saw before. Certain teams were quietly becoming bottlenecks because work kept bouncing back to them. The automation itself did not save much time. It made invisible friction visible.\n\nI think the weird automations that stick are the ones that change how people see the system, not just how fast they click. Curious if your emoji trigger ended up shaping behavior at all, or if it stayed purely for fun?",

I'm more productive. Less stressed.\n\n**But here's the weird part:**\n\nI feel guilty telling coworkers I \"prepared thoroughly\" when really robots did most of it.\n\nLike when my boss compliments my meeting notes and I'm thinking \"yeah, AI transcribed and summarized that.\"\n\nOr when someone asks \"how do you stay on top of everything?\" and I don't mention automation because it feels like cheating.\n\n**The question:**\n\nIs this the new normal and I just need to get over it?\n\nOr is there something ethically weird about automating preparation work and taking credit for being organized?\n\n**Genuine confusion:**\n\nIf a chef uses a food processor instead of chopping by hand, nobody cares.

We primarily use Clio but it is clunky at best because Clio bought one or two different Law Firm programs and tried to mash all the code together even though they don't work well with one another. Wherever there was throttling because of coding or bottlenecking due to overlapping program nonsense, I have used AI to build automation software that now turns my 60 plus hours per week of really hard work into 40 hours of mostly goofing around.\n\nHowever, I should note that I am also an IT professional and I can't imagine a lay person would be able to do what I've done. A little bit of know-how and a white swath of knowledge in the IT field and you can automate pretty much anything.\n\nBefore ai, I automated an entire government department out of jobs, including myself. I wrote a handful of ducky scripts to make my job easier, and as I kept going, I realized that more and more of my job could be done automatically. Eventually, it didn't require people and my boss noticed, sent it to hr, HR declared my entire department redundant, and then everyone in my department was let go. I didn't leave any documentation because I didn't expect to need it, but they never reached out to me for help with the apps/scripts that I wrote so I'm guessing they just hired one of their IT people to makes sense of it and train some of their pre-existing employees.\n\nMy current employer is not only impressed that I am automating so many of our processes, she has offered to pay me 25% of any program that I can replace through my own coding so if a program costs us $500 a month at the law firm and I can replace it with some tailored code for the firm specifically rather than an overarching all-encompassing program with a lot of features that we don't need, then I get an extra $125/mo for so long as they use the program, whether or not I am still with them. She also pays for my time that I practice and learn coding outside of regular office hours because the better I get at this, the more I can do to save the business loads of money.",

From what I’ve seen, the best wins come from automating routine communication tasks, like handling incoming inquiries, filtering notifications, or posting updates in channels for solo operators or small teams. The biggest headaches are almost always the deployment part: server setup, maintenance, and keeping things running 24/7. Most guides gloss over how much time you burn just on DevOps. In fact, that was the reason we built a product to skip all that and let you launch an OpenClaw agent on Telegram without touching servers or docker.

In my experience, the wins usually come from automating narrow, repetitive workflows, not full decision-making systems. Things like internal reporting, lead qualification, or status updates tend to deliver real ROI. The big autonomous agent setups often look impressive but require more oversight than expected.\n\nCurious for those who saw real impact, was it because the process was already clearly defined before automation? I’m starting to think automation works best where the workflow is already clean.",

The process required human intervention because automated outreach methods lost effectiveness after a brief period.   \n  \nOur team developed a support triage system for a client which combined GPT technology with Slack and basic operational rules. The system succeeded at routing and tagging tasks but encountered challenges when we attempted to use it for complex ticket resolution. The lesson learned from this experience demonstrated that AI excels at creating structured drafts but fails to handle special judgment situations.   \n  \nThe main conclusion demonstrates that automation achieves its highest effectiveness when it eliminates repetitive tasks which require advance preparation instead of attempting to take over all aspects of decision-making.",

Here's what I'd actually suggest instead of jumping into AI automation agencies (which everyone recommends but requires clients and sales skills you don't have yet):\n\nStart a faceless YouTube or TikTok channel. You don't need a camera, don't need to show your face. AI can generate scripts, images, voiceovers, even entire videos now. Pick a niche like scary stories, motivation, finance tips, or history facts. Post 1 video a day. YouTube pays through AdSense once you hit 1K subs + 4K watch hours.\n\nTo start for free: ChatGPT for scripts, CapCut for editing, Canva for thumbnails. There are also AI video generators that make the whole video from a single prompt if you want to skip editing entirely. I actually built one called Keyvello  because I got tired of the editing grind myself -- you can try it free if you want.\n\nDon't overthink it. Make your first video today. It'll be bad, that's fine. You learn by doing, not by watching courses. You're 18 and already looking for ways -- that puts you ahead of most people.\n\n",

Then expand.\n\nAI is not magic. It is force multiplication.",

I wouldn’t describe it as a “cost-saver” so much as a major accelerator and enabler of our work. The savings, if any, are indirect because we’ve not needed to replace some folks who have left. Concretely, we just shipped something in 2 months that I think would have taken 9-12 months to build in 2023. And despite the condescending tone people take when speaking about “vibe code” I think our quality has never been better because we supplement human review with agent reviewers, have agents reviewers enforce quality standards, and help us implement new forms of testing that we previously never had time for (performance benchmarking, backwards compatibility, etc). We have agents review and help refine every plan  before work begins and every change on the backend after work is completed. So we’re moving faster with better quality than ever before. We’re still finding more ways to use it and I think by the end of the year our AI bill could reach 20% of what we spend on R&D headcount. It’s a lot but seems clearly worth it to maximize the leverage of each employee.\n\nI do have some ideas for agents that autonomously do things like triage support requests, replying automatically when something is clearly covered by existing docs or when more information is needed to reproduce. I haven’t built them yet though so I can’t comment on the effectiveness.\n\nI think all of these things are best viewed through the lenses of efficiency and competitiveness rather than cost-savings. If your company doesn’t use these tools to triple its output this year you’re going to get disrupted by someone who does.\n\nEdit to add more context: Part of how we’ve been able to realize these significant productivity gains is relentlessly looking for bottlenecks. Once everyone was coding with AI we quickly realized our CI testing was too slow. And once we got that resolved we realized we were getting too many merge conflicts so we reorganized our code to reduce that. Right now we’re experimenting with more and different types of agent review and automated checks to reduce the amount of human scrutiny needed in review. We’re a small org and everyone is all-in; in a larger company it would probably be harder to adopt as quickly.",

          "text": "Real experience here — I run a freelance automation practice and it's genuinely consistent work, not just one-offs.\n\nThe demand breaks down into a few buckets:\n\n1. Business process automation — This is the bread and butter. Small businesses drowning in manual tasks: invoice processing, lead capture from forms into CRMs, report generation, data syncing between platforms. They don't even know what n8n or Zapier is — they just know they're spending 10 hours a week on something that should take zero. These clients pay well and come back for more once they see the first workflow running.\n\n2. Web scraping — Steady demand but more project-based. Price monitoring, competitor tracking, lead generation, real estate listings, job aggregation. The recurring revenue comes from maintenance contracts because websites change their structure and scrapers break. That's where the real money is — not the initial build, but the \"keep it running\" retainer.\n\n3. Social monitoring / content automation — Growing fast. I built a system that monitors 15 Reddit subreddits, filters by keywords, and auto-drafts replies using a local AI model. Businesses want this kind of thing for lead generation, reputation monitoring, and content research. Most don't know it's possible until you show them.\n\n4. Data pipeline / integration work — Connecting APIs that don't natively talk to each other. CRM to accounting software, e-commerce to shipping, form submissions to Slack notifications. Boring but endless demand.\n\nThe key is positioning yourself as solving a business problem, not selling \"automation scripts.\" Nobody searches for \"I need a Python script.\" They search for \"how do I stop manually copying data between spreadsheets every Monday.\"\n\nIt's not niche — it's just underserved because most businesses don't know these solutions exist until someone shows them.",

For example go to a Plumbing company and help them automate lead generation from google maps. A lot of these companies are already doing it manually and you can sell this as a solution without the need to expose the tech. There are literally hundreds of such examples.

      "text": "We all know that there are a lot of AI tools in the market right now, but in real business environments, there is only a small subset actually sticks.\n\nHere are some AI tools I use *consistently* for productivity, with the exact use case and not the marketing pitch also just wanting to help every serious business owners who are stuck in between these tools.\n\n**1. AI meeting assistants (Otter, Fathom, Zoom AI)**  \n**What they’re actually used for:**  \n– auto notes  \n– action items  \n– searchable decisions\n\n**Real example:**  \nInstead of someone rewriting meeting notes, the transcript is auto-shared, action items are pushed to a task tool, and nobody argues about “what was decided”.\n\nIf a tool doesn’t reliably capture *decisions*, teams stop using it.\n\n**2. AI email / inbox assistants (Superhuman AI, Gmail AI)**  \n**What sticks:**  \n– summarizing long threads  \n– drafting replies from context\n\n**The real example:**  \nExecutives don’t use AI to write emails from scratch. They use it to understand a 30-message thread in 10 seconds and respond quickly.\n\n**3. AI scheduling tools (Motion, Reclaim)**  \n**What they’re actually good at:**  \n– protecting focus time  \n– auto-rescheduling when priorities change\n\n**example:**  \nInstead of manually rearranging calendars every time a meeting is added, the tool does it based on priority rules people already follow.\n\n**4. AI CRM enrichment tools (Clay, Clearbit + AI layers)**  \n**What works:**  \n– auto-filling missing lead data  \n– qualifying inbound leads\n\n**How to do:**  \nSales teams stop wasting time Googling companies. Records arrive already enriched enough to decide *who* should follow up.\n\n**5. AI content assistants (Writer, Jasper, Notion AI)**  \n**What actually gets used:**  \n– first drafts  \n– rewriting  \n– tone consistency\n\n**Like:**  \nMarketing teams don’t publish raw AI output. They use it to go from blank page → editable draft in minutes.\n\n**Pattern I keep seeing is t**he AI tools that survive don’t *replace* work. They remove friction around work people already do.\n\nIf a tool asks teams to change how they think or operate, it gets abandoned fast. If you’re evaluating AI tools for productivity, ask one question:“What manual step does this remove immediately?”\n\nThat answer predicts adoption better than any feature list.",

If your invoices follow a consistent format, you could keep your customer list in Excel with invoice number and email columns, then use something like Power Automate or Zapier to watch a specific folder where you save the scanned invoices. When a new PDF is added, the automation can match the invoice number to the Excel sheet, pull the customer email, and automatically send the email with a preset subject line that includes the invoice number and date.\n\nIf you want to go one step further, look into using a scanner that can automatically save files into a specific folder with a consistent naming format. Once the file name includes the invoice number, the rest becomes much easier to automate. You would still review things at first to make sure it works correctly, but after that the process should go from a repetitive daily task to just a quick check instead of doing every step manually.",

You can 'train' its AI in minutes to find the Invoice Number, Date, and Customer Name on your specific scan.\n3. **The Brain (Zapier):** This is where you connect the dots. Zapier can take that info from Parsio, look up the email in your Excel sheet, and then draft the email in Gmail automatically.\n\nI usually tell people to ask: *'Does this task require judgment or just repetition?'* Since looking up an email and typing a subject line is 100% rule-based, it’s the perfect candidate for automation.\n\nAre the invoices all in the same format, or do they come from many different vendors?

Break it down enough so the nothing is too hard to understand and test. I rather have 4 workflows that solve a problem working together than one. \n\nHere is an example\nI had to upload a file from our api to a marketing services api.\nThen create an audience in that api and associate it with that file.\nFinally I had to poll for results till it was done.\nThat could have been one workflow but I made it more than one\n\n1) gets the data from our api to make the csv\n2) uploads csv to their api\n3) created audience and connects uploaded csv\n4) polling\n\nThis way I could test and build one at a time",

I went through the same confusion when I started, was bouncing between Zapier and Make for months until I realized the tool matters way less than picking the right workflow.
