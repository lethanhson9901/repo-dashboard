So what happens? More output. Same chaos.\n\nLeads come in faster, but follow-ups still break.  \nCampaigns scale, but reporting is still manual.  \nAI writes content, but no one knows what actually shipped or converted.\n\nThe automation itself works. The system around it doesn’t. What actually creates leverage isn’t automating the flashy parts, it’s automating the boring internal handoffs nobody wants to touch because they “still work”. Ironically, those are the ones quietly eating the most time and causing the most errors.\n\nCurious if others are seeing the same thing: are people using AI to *move faster into broken systems* instead of fixing the systems first?",

These are the areas that, if automated properly, would create the most significant improvements in efficiency and reduce errors. Fixing those internal bottlenecks first can actually make external automation much more effective and sustainable.\n\nIt’s like automating a broken assembly line, it might move faster, but it won’t be any more reliable.

I’ll automate one annoying step, then realize it quietly depends on five other steps being clean and consistent. Before I know it, I’m maintaining a small system instead of saving time. Debugging edge cases, dealing with messy data, hitting rate limits, handling weird failures it starts to feel less like automation and more like ops work.  \nI’m curious how other people here think about this. Do you aim for “good enough” automation or try to go end to end? How do you decide when a workflow is worth maintaining long term versus just doing it manually?

It starts as “let me save 5 minutes,” then suddenly you’re maintaining a tiny system with assumptions baked in from six months ago.\n\nUsing Clay helped me mainly by changing what I automate. I don’t try to build full end-to-end flows anymore. I use it more for the messy thinking parts: pulling data from multiple places, adding a bit of context, spotting signals, and deciding whether something is even worth acting on. Once that decision is clear, the rest of the workflow can stay simple or even manual without feeling like a step backward. The automations that last for me are the ones with a narrow job and low blast radius. One table does enrichment or research, another just scores or flags things, and that’s it. If something breaks, I can rerun or tweak it without unraveling everything. That shift made automation feel useful again instead of like ops debt I was quietly accumulating.",

Start with something that runs manually when you trigger it, make sure it handles the messiest version of your data, then decide if it's stable enough to run on a schedule. A lot of workflows don't need to be fully autonomous, having a human check one decision point in the middle is often way more reliable than trying to account for every edge case.\n\nThe other thing is knowing when not to automate. If a task changes frequently or the rules are fuzzy, automation just becomes technical debt.

          "text": "I feel you. \n\nI am a non-developer yet built my own \"AI Panel\" with unified memory across all my web subscription frontier models.\n\n**For skimmers**: The minimal version involves about 2-3 browser tabs with AI models of your choice, providing the same prompt to each, and comparing outputs manually. That catches some errors a single model would miss.\n\n*But* for white collar professional work - whether legal analysis, financial documents, or technical specs - \"some\" isn't good enough.\n\nThe above minimal approach lacks persistent memory (you're re-explaining context every session), structured adversarial prompts (models politely agree rather than attack each other's reasoning), and artifact verification (no one's checking citations against primary sources).\n\n*What follows is what happens when I addressed these gaps systematically.*\n\n**What it gets me:**\n\n1. **Fast drafting**: Claude Desktop app orchestrates 3-6 rounds with my other AI Panel members while I go for a morning walk.\n\n2. **Hard verification**: Approximately 5 models adversarially checking each other's work.\n\n3. **Persistent context**: Spans months of knowledge without re-explaining context every session - no more \"as I mentioned earlier\" when the AI has already forgotten.\n\nI'm my AI Panel's manager. Claude Desktop (Opus 4.5, via Claude Max 5x subscription) handles orchestration - I designated Claude Desktop app as my AI Panel's \"First Among Equals.\"\n\nClaude Desktop controls my web browsers, interacting with other Panel members (ChatGPT Plus, Gemini Pro, Grok, Perplexity Pro, occasionally Copilot). \n\nDuring this automated orchestration, Claude distributes role-specific prompts to each Panel member via browser automation, collects responses, and identifies agreement/disagreement. It flags when one member catches an error another missed and generates follow-up prompts to resolve conflicts.\n\nEach round, Claude produces a running synthesis that sharpens as models pressure-test each other. \n\nBy the final round, Claude delivers consolidated output reflecting surviving consensus - or a clear map of where the Panel diverged and why.\n\nIf my Panel can't agree after 6 rounds (\"Round 6 Hard Stop\"), it escalates to me.\n\n---\n\n**What makes it work:**\n\n**Memory & Context**\n\n- **Unified memory layer**: All Panel members query shared persistent memory (via a specialized PC app + local memory servers + web browser extensions including OpenMemory + each AI's native memory), so context doesn't get lost when switching models or starting new chats.\n\nTo clarify: \"unified memory\" means a shared external repository with retrieval capabilities - local files, a memory database, structured notes - that all models can query on demand. Not shared weights, not magical cross-vendor brain fusion.\n\n**Infrastructure & Automation**\n\n- **MCP infrastructure**: About 10 MCP servers including filesystem, memory, Google Drive, PDF tools, Playwright (browser automation), Context7 (live documentation), desktop-commander, and Windows-MCP.\n\nAlmost all managed through lazy-router - a hierarchical proxy that reduced startup context overhead by lazy-loading tools on demand instead of dumping dozens of tool definitions at startup.\n\n(Note: Anthropic released their own \"Tool Search Tool\" in November 2025 achieving similar context savings. I built lazy-router before this existed.)\n\n- **MCP SuperAssistant proxy**: A browser extension gateway exposing my local MCP tools to browser-based AIs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Grok). They get read-only visibility into my filesystem and memory - so they see what Claude sees, without write access.\n\n(Security note: Browser AIs get read-only access only. Claude Desktop is the only Panel member with write permissions.)\n\n- **Browser automation**: Claude Desktop can read/write to my PC's files, query long-term memory, and interact with browser tabs where other Panel members live.\n\nI also use Claude for Chrome - a recent browser agent that can read pages, navigate sites, fill forms, and execute multi-step workflows across tabs, integrating directly with Claude Code.\n\n**Claude Code & Subagents**\n\nClaude Desktop now includes Claude Code (Anthropic's terminal-based agentic coding tool) built into the interface.\n\nClaude Code offers things my cross-vendor Panel doesn't:\n\n- **Native subagents**: Specialized AI subagents with persistent instructions - like a \"meeting notes processor\" or \"document reviewer\" I spin up without rebuilding prompts each time.\n\n- **True parallel execution**: Multiple subagents run simultaneously on different aspects of a problem, tighter and faster than browser automation latency.\n\n- **Plan Mode**: Claude Code asks clarifying questions upfront and drafts a plan.md file before executing, making complex workflows more predictable.\n\n---\n\n**(Continued in my comment below - External Integrations, Governance, Cost/Time)**",

(Utility tool, not a Panel member.)\n\n- **Writing polish**: Grammarly catches mechanical errors before final review. (Also a utility, not a Panel member.)\n\n**Governance & Quality Control**\n\n- **Structured response format**: Every Panel member must deliver: position, confidence level with reasoning, dissent from majority (with evidence), blindspot check, and at least 3 novel suggestions not yet raised.\n\nEvery response requires a \"Potential Embarrassment\" self-audit: \"Would you be embarrassed if the user or another Panel member found this sloppy?\" If yes, revise before submitting.\n\nEvery response must conclude with \"Justification of Continued Panel Membership\" - articulating why that contribution earns continued presence on my prestigious Panel.\n\n- **Adversarial verification**: They're competing, not collaborating (with guardrails - Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude once went for each other's jugulars, so I intervened).\n\nEach must catch others' mistakes. Falsification-first: try to kill your own analysis before submission.\n\n*Important: This isn't majority-vote consensus.* The adversarial prompts instruct each model to attack others' reasoning. For citations/factual claims, I require primary-source verification. The goal is error detection through structured disagreement, not \"three models said it so it must be true.\"\n\n- **Archaeology Gate**: Before proposing new tools, Claude checks what's already been built in prior sessions - searches handoff logs, memory, filesystem. Prevents duplicate effort and institutional amnesia.\n\n- **Approved ≠ Implemented**: Nothing \"works\" until empirically verified. Speculation gets killed fast and documented.\n\n- **Grading + governance**: Every Panel member grades every other member (A+ to F) - including Claude grading itself.\n\nClaude has authority to recommend \"personnel action\" based on performance. Sample recent Claude commentary to ChatGPT Plus: *\"You wrote 800 words about why everyone should write 500 words. The irony is not lost.\"*\n\nGemini Pro was recently on a formal Performance Improvement Plan - barely survived after I threatened to cancel my subscription. (This aligns with what many Redditors have noticed: Gemini 3 Pro consistently fails to follow instructions in prompts or custom instructions/Gems.)\n\n- **Reproducibility**: Every session closes with tailored handoff protocol across multiple save targets (filesystem, native memory, markdown logs). Full traceability - no more \"what did we decide last week.\"\n\n---\n\n**Cost**: ~$300/mo total (Claude Max 5x, ChatGPT Plus, Gemini Pro, Perplexity Pro, Grok, Otter AI, Grammarly).\n\nBut I now work about 50% less than I had to at my same white collar job.\n\nNo API pricing, no token counting - I'd get slaughtered on API given my daily volume.\n\n**Time to build**: 150+ hours over ~6 weeks (PowerShell, JSON schema orchestration, MCP configs, integration plumbing), though much was watching Claude Code work.\n\nWhy so long? Beyond core architecture: debugging ARM64 compatibility (Surface Laptop 7's Snapdragon X Elite breaks many x64-assumed tools), rewriting governance protocols until they stuck, building the handoff system, and iterating through dozens of failed MCP configurations.\n\nPlus constant refinement given how fast AI moves.\n\n**TLDR**: Single-model reliance is how you get hallucinations that slip through.

Over the last year, we’ve seen tools come and go, systems get stitched together, and “set it and forget it” setups quietly fall apart. Some automations now feel essential, others just add fragility.\n\nSo I’m curious how this looks for people actually operating at scale now- not demos or theory, but what’s really running day to day and holding up. What is your automation stack in 2026?",

Here are the ones that I keep paying for now:\n\n* N8N: N8N in my opinion is Zapier on steroids! You can create quiet complex automations using this, especially if you have a technical background as well! \n* Clay: 6 months ago, my team experimented with a new ABM outbound strategy by using Clay. Whenever we get contact information on a really interesting lead, we run a sequence with Clay where we automatically check if we have worked with anyone else in their industry, if we have testimonials to share, and if the company has been in the news lately too.   \n* Frizerly: Their AI agent that learns all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an blog every day on your website to help you improve your Google ranking is pretty impressive! It can auto identify content gaps from competitors, improve based on results etc! Much better tool than Semrush etc imo! \n* Sierra: Sierra is really good at auto resolving repetitive customer support tickets! It can learn from both past answers, your internal docs, faqs etc! We have gotten it to be able to resolve about 50% of all tickets instantly while rest are routed to real humans \n\nCurious what others have it going as well!",

I run an agency where we use agents for content, research, lead gen and support, and at first I tried to track them with logs, Slack messages and spreadsheets. Nothing held up and silent failures were the worst. The fix that made it reliable was centralizing everything and treating agents more like teammates instead of scripts, so I always know what each one is doing, when it last ran, and if something failed. I now tie that into workflows with tools like n8n for orchestration, Slack alerts for failures, and a lightweight tracker called aigencytracker so I can see all agents in one place. It doesn’t just save time, it removes the constant mental overhead of wondering what might be broken or forgotten, and that’s been a real game changer. I’m still experimenting though, so I’m very open to hearing how others are solving this or what tools and patterns are working for them!!!",

      "text": "New year so figured I'd share the tools that actually stuck around after trying way too much stuff last year. These are the ones I genuinely use not just installed once and forgot about.\n\nCursor for coding assistance. Tried alternatives but kept coming back. The tab completion just works.\n\nn8n for automations. Self hosted it and forgot about it which is exactly what I want.\n\nLangsmith for tracing LLM calls. Saved me so many times when something breaks and I need to see what happened.\n\nVellum for ai agents. Got frustrated with how challenging other tools were, and this experience was 10x better Granola for meeting notes. Not perfect but good enough that I stopped taking notes manually.\n\nPlaywright for browser automation. Tried the AI wrappers but they added complexity without much benefit.\n\nPinecone for vector stuff. Tried self hosting but the maintenance wasnt worth it at my scale.\n\nLogsnag for simple monitoring. Sends me a ping when things happen without setting up a whole observability stack.\n\nClaude directly in the app for quick scripts. Faster than spinning up a project for something I'll run once.\n\nNotion with their AI features for docs. Not groundbreaking but having everything in one place matters. Although very pricey, and I could potentially do the same thing with ChatGPT\n\nWhat tools survived your 2025 culling?",

I’m very proud to say that this workflow saves the company \\~50 hours a week.\n\nBefore this automation, the company was manually copying LinkedIn URLs, searching Apollo one by one, and pasting contact info into Google Sheets. Now they can just paste a CSV of leads, hit run, and the workflow automatically enriches each contact through Apollo (name, email, company, title) and dumps everything into the same spreadsheet (which integrates into their existing workflow).\n\nCurious how people built their reputation initially to get started in automation? Did you also offer workflows for free?\n\nP.S - If anybody needs a workflow built, please let me know. I’d be happy to work for free for the first few people in exchange for a review!\n\nEdit :- Some of you guys have been asking for the template, so [here](https://www.noclick.com/workflow/apollo-enrichment-workflow) is the link.

API and backend testing are in a good place, but UI regression continues to be the main issue, especially in areas where selectors are unstable or UI structure isn’t consistently exposed.  \n  \nHere’s how some of the tools we’ve tested so far:\n\n* Playwright / Cypress: strong for modern web apps with a clean DOM, but maintenance cost rises quickly once the UI gets dynamic or partially non-web\n* TestComplete / Ranorex: broad UI support and mature features, though licensing cost and long-term scalability are real considerations\n* UiPath / Power Automate: solid for RPA-style workflows, but they felt more process-automation focused than test-centric for our needs\n* Pure image-based tools (Sikuli, PyAutoGUI): quick to prototype with, but brittleness becomes an issue beyond small scripts\n\nWe’ve also been testing Askui, mainly because it works at the visual/UI level instead of relying on selectors or control trees. It’s been useful for certain edge cases where traditional approaches break down, though it’s clearly not a replacement for standard test frameworks.\n\nFor teams who’ve gone through similar evaluation how did you decide which UI gaps were worth automating vs leaving manual? did anyone successfully combine visual automation with traditional tooling? and what mattered most for long-term maintainability??\n\nWill be highly appreciative of your input!!",

If a UI path is business critical and failures would cause revenue loss, compliance risk, or major escalations, it is worth automating even if the tests are imperfect. Everything else is a candidate for manual or spot checks. Visual automation can be useful for brittle or legacy surfaces, but only as a thin safety net, not a full regression strategy, because maintenance cost compounds fast. At scale, this becomes a risk because flaky tests erode trust and get ignored. The long term win usually comes from reducing the surface area you try to automate and pushing more logic into stable layers, even if that means accepting some manual coverage. Automation is about risk containment, not 100 percent coverage.",

I found my first few via Upwork, Fiverr, and LinkedIn\n* Keep messages short and focused on value (X+ hours saved or $X saved) and skip all technical details in the pitch\n* Follow-up religiously with people who showed interest until they say yes or no clearly\n* Ask for reviews and referrals once you have them as customers\n\n5 clients paying you \\~$100/month isn’t a lot, but it gets you started and once you have social proof trust compounds and you can scale much faster.\n\nCurious how other people here got their first clients?",

But the thing is, I want to be more capable, but I have no where to sart.   \n  \nI want to go deeper into automation, I want to help other departments with it as well, I want my colleagues to have less things to do so they live happier, less stressful lives.\n\nI told my superior that I would like to get some sort of course to learn more about all this and they said \"Hell yeah\" if I can just show them which one I want they will fund it and I've been looking for one to send them for around a month now but I just don't know if it even makes any sense.\n\nI absolutely love the process of automating that I already do and I want to be better, more useful cause as it is right now, I can basically just do 1 thing and fix it if it's broken but I know I can do more if I just had some direction.\n\nIf you guys got any recommendations of where I should start, or some place where to learn, how to get experience so I can actually start doing things here that would be amazing.",

That opens up way more possibilities than just RPA tools. You could automate across departments, build custom integrations, even create web interfaces for your colleagues to use.\n\nActually if you want to see what modern automation looks like - we're using AI agents at Notte to automate browser tasks that would normally require complex RPA setups.

Brain dump, planning, overthinking… it handles all of it better than I do most days\n* **Claude & Gemini** – Got these recommended a while back and now I rotate between them for writing, summaries, and school-related stuff. Each one has its own strengths.\n* **Suno** – Still my favorite for messing around with music ideas. Not replacing real production, but great for quick inspiration.\n* **Gensmo** – Super convenient when I don’t feel like putting outfits together. Surprisingly decent suggestions.\n* **Zoviz** – I’ve been using it lately for branding-related things (logos, visuals, quick design assets). I’m not a designer, so having something that keeps things consistent without much effort has been helpful.\n\nCurious what everyone else is relying on this year. Are you sticking with a few core tools or constantly trying new ones as they pop up?",

Build a few concrete examples, even if they are self-initiated or for friends. n8n, Python, and agents can come later. Clients pay for outcomes, not tool breadth.

What usually helps is mapping where the same question or action repeats during the day and asking why it exists at all. If that loop is not addressed, no tool really fixes the feeling.",

That way you can A/B test hooks and scripts without regenerating the whole thing. I’ve chained things like Make and Zapier with vid tools (e.g., Pika or Runway) and a tracker like Notion/Airtable; Pulse plus keyword alerts and scheduling tools can watch for niche trends and auto-queue new video ideas.
