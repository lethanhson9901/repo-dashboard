Fixing those internal bottlenecks first can actually make external automation much more effective and sustainable.\n\nIt’s like automating a broken assembly line, it might move faster, but it won’t be any more reliable. Fixing the process foundation should come first.",

      "text": "I keep seeing this take on Reddit that doesn't matter what tool you use, LinkedIn will detect ANY automation and ban you. this is wrong, technically\n\nI've been running LinkedIn outbound for B2B clients for a while and got curious enough to actually understand how these tools work under the hood. Turns out the type of technology matters way more than we realize. LinkedIn detects automation based on HOW the tool interacts with their platform. not all methods are equally visible. I know only 3 types of automation (if you know more, let me know):\n\n1. Extensions.\n2. Cloud based services\n3. Standalone browsers\n\nChrome **extensions** like Dux-Soup or Waalaxy inject JavaScript directly into LinkedIn's webpage. Every extension has a Chrome Store ID and local files. LinkedIn literally runs scripts to search for these IDs.\n\n**Cloud services l**ike Expandi, Dripify, Lemlist send API requests from remote servers. When you browse LinkedIn normally, your browser fires off tons of background requests - analytics, feed refreshes, notification checks. Cloud tools only send the bare minimum requests they need. LinkedIn can see your API traffic is incomplete compared to real users. Still they are harder to spot than extensions, but not impossible.\n\n**Standalone browsers** (LinkedHelper is the main one I know) work like a modified Chromium browser running locally. It uses LinkedIn like a normal browser would, but automated, it mimics mouse movements, randomized timing and other patterns of human behavior. LinkedIn detection systems are looking for specific technical fingerprints, and when it's a standalone browser, it's hard to distinguish from human. I'm not saying standalone browsers are undetectable or that you can't get banned using them, but the risk is different. From what I've heard you can't use your LinkedIn account from a different browser at the same time as your automation tool works, and you have limits to follow.\n\nIf you've've been banned, what were you using and what do you think the actual trigger was? trying to separate technical detection from just behavioral red flags\n\n",

Extensions are the easiest to flag because they literally announce themselves. Cloud tools sit in an awkward middle ground — cleaner than extensions, but their traffic patterns often don’t look like a real browsing session.\n\nStandalone browsers are interesting because they blur that line. They behave like a full browser, generate “normal-looking” noise, and avoid obvious extension fingerprints. That doesn’t make them safe, but it *does* change the risk profile.\n\nOne thing I’d add: a lot of bans people blame on “automation” are actually **behavioral**:\n\n* sending too many connection requests\n* repeating the same copy\n* moving faster than any human ever would\n* logging in from multiple environments at once\n\nTech gets you noticed, behavior gets you flagged.\n\nIn most ban stories I’ve heard, it’s rarely one single thing — it’s automation *plus* aggressive patterns. Separating those two, like you’re trying to do here, is the right way to think about it.",

But I’m curious about real-world usage.  \nFor those who’ve tried SleekFlow or similar WhatsApp automation tools:  \nDid it actually replace your CRM and live chat stack?  \nWhere did it fall short?  \nAny hidden limitations with scaling, reporting, automation rules, or team workflows?  \nWould love to hear what worked, what didn’t and whether you ended up adding extra tools anyway.",

These are the ones I genuinely use not just installed once and forgot about.\n\nCursor for coding assistance. Tried alternatives but kept coming back. The tab completion just works.\n\nn8n for automations. Self hosted it and forgot about it which is exactly what I want.\n\nLangsmith for tracing LLM calls. Saved me so many times when something breaks and I need to see what happened.\n\nVellum for ai agents. Got frustrated with how challenging other tools were, and this experience was 10x better Granola for meeting notes. Not perfect but good enough that I stopped taking notes manually.\n\nPlaywright for browser automation. Tried the AI wrappers but they added complexity without much benefit.\n\nPinecone for vector stuff. Tried self hosting but the maintenance wasnt worth it at my scale.\n\nLogsnag for simple monitoring. Sends me a ping when things happen without setting up a whole observability stack.\n\nClaude directly in the app for quick scripts. Faster than spinning up a project for something I'll run once.\n\nNotion with their AI features for docs. Not groundbreaking but having everything in one place matters. Although very pricey, and I could potentially do the same thing with ChatGPT\n\nWhat tools survived your 2025 culling?",

      "text": "Automating things isn’t really the hard part anymore. Tools are everywhere, setup is fast, and half the time it feels like you’re just connecting boxes.\n\nWhat still feels oddly difficult is deciding what’s actually worth automating. I’ve definitely fallen into the trap of automating stuff just because I could. Research steps, enrichment, handoffs, little checks that used to be manual. Some of it genuinely saves time. Some of it just creates cleaner looking chaos. I bounce between a few tools depending on the workflow. I use Clay a lot for upstream research and signals, Notion to keep things visible, Zapier for glue work, and HubSpot as the system of record. None of them are the problem on their own.\n\nThe tricky part is that bad automation doesn’t feel broken right away. It feels productive. Stuff moves, tasks disappear, dashboards look nicer. Then a week later you realize you’re reviewing outputs that didn’t need to exist, or worse, trusting something you shouldn’t have. Lately I’ve been trying to be more intentional about where automation stops and where judgment actually matters. Less about how much I can automate, more about whether the step creates leverage or just saves a few clicks.\n\nCurious how others here think about this. How do you decide what stays manual on purpose vs what gets automated without thinking too hard about it.",

          "text": "Yes, exactly, the key point in automation is really knowing when it actually makes sense to use it. Here’s how I usually decide what to automate to make sure automation is actually effective:\n\n1 .  Simple rule: automate the flow, not the decision\n\nThe idea is that automation works best when the process is repetitive, predictable, and follows a clear workflow.\n\nSo it makes sense to automate things where:\n\n* there’s a clear path (“if A → do B”)\n* there are very few unknowns or unexpected turns\n* mistakes aren’t expensive\n* the output is easy to verify\n\nBut decisions that involve a lot of nuance, risk, and context are better left to a human.\n\nFor example, you can automate:\n\n* data collection / moving information between systems\n* reminders / statuses / syncing\n* “draft-level” classification (tags, categories, priority)\n\n2 . The “leverage test”: does it create leverage or just save 3 clicks?\n\nIf an automation:\n\n* speeds up the cycle (lead → meeting → payment)\n* reduces losses (missed calls / forgotten leads)\n* improves quality (fewer mistakes / higher conversion) then it’s worth doing.\n\nIf it just “looks nice” but adds another layer of checking, it usually doesn’t bring real value, it’s basically what you said: “clean-looking chaos.”\n\nHope this helps!

It will automatically map out the process and basically tell you exactly where you should be looking.\n\nSince most process mining tools are pretty expensive, I built my own that works pretty well.

I found my first few via Upwork, Fiverr, and LinkedIn\n* Keep messages short and focused on value (X+ hours saved or $X saved) and skip all technical details in the pitch\n* Follow-up religiously with people who showed interest until they say yes or no clearly\n* Ask for reviews and referrals once you have them as customers\n\n5 clients paying you \\~$100/month isn’t a lot, but it gets you started and once you have social proof trust compounds and you can scale much faster.\n\nCurious how other people here got their first clients?",

If a known prospect or company browses my site, I get notified in HubSpot that they visited. I would use Apollo for outreach (email, LinkedIn, calls), and all activity is logged back into HubSpot automatically. Once someone is ready, a contract is auto-sent and signed online (DocuSign/PandaDoc/SignWell), and that status is tracked in the CRM too.

API and backend testing are in a good place, but UI regression continues to be the main issue, especially in areas where selectors are unstable or UI structure isn’t consistently exposed.  \n  \nHere’s how some of the tools we’ve tested so far:\n\n* Playwright / Cypress: strong for modern web apps with a clean DOM, but maintenance cost rises quickly once the UI gets dynamic or partially non-web\n* TestComplete / Ranorex: broad UI support and mature features, though licensing cost and long-term scalability are real considerations\n* UiPath / Power Automate: solid for RPA-style workflows, but they felt more process-automation focused than test-centric for our needs\n* Pure image-based tools (Sikuli, PyAutoGUI): quick to prototype with, but brittleness becomes an issue beyond small scripts\n\nWe’ve also been testing Askui, mainly because it works at the visual/UI level instead of relying on selectors or control trees. It’s been useful for certain edge cases where traditional approaches break down, though it’s clearly not a replacement for standard test frameworks.\n\nFor teams who’ve gone through similar evaluation how did you decide which UI gaps were worth automating vs leaving manual? did anyone successfully combine visual automation with traditional tooling? and what mattered most for long-term maintainability??\n\nWill be highly appreciative of your input!!",

If a UI path is business critical and failures would cause revenue loss, compliance risk, or major escalations, it is worth automating even if the tests are imperfect. Everything else is a candidate for manual or spot checks. Visual automation can be useful for brittle or legacy surfaces, but only as a thin safety net, not a full regression strategy, because maintenance cost compounds fast. At scale, this becomes a risk because flaky tests erode trust and get ignored. The long term win usually comes from reducing the surface area you try to automate and pushing more logic into stable layers, even if that means accepting some manual coverage.

Once you got that, keep a list of things you want to automate for yourself and get to work.\n\nIm terms of tools, if you're brand new, I'd say start with zapier to get a fundamental understanding of automation in the simplest form. Graduate to make, then n8n.\n\nAnd do yourself a favor, learn to market yourself and build an email list while you're learning. Your future self with thank you. Trust me",

For learning, I would go deeper into Power Platform first if you are already there, especially Power Automate and proper error handling, logging, and versioning. Parallel to that, learning basic SQL and API concepts will unlock far more automation than any single course.

Long running agents with memory and feedback loops are exactly where subtle errors compound instead of surfacing cleanly.\n\nIn support and ops contexts, continuity without traceability is usually where things break. An agent can look coherent while slowly drifting into bad assumptions based on earlier interactions. How are you inspecting why it reacted a certain way three or four cycles later, not just what it did in the moment?\n\nThe idea is compelling. The risk is that social looking behavior masks the lack of clear accountability when something goes wrong. That tends to be where real world deployments struggle.",

Like I’m wondering who’s behind it, how actively it’s maintained, and what their long-term goals are. With browsers, trust is everything, and it's hard to tell early on if something is truly built for privacy or just looks like it.\n\nBut yeah, so far, no red flags.

Each one has its own strengths.\n* **Suno** – Still my favorite for messing around with music ideas. Not replacing real production, but great for quick inspiration.\n* **Gensmo** – Super convenient when I don’t feel like putting outfits together. Surprisingly decent suggestions.\n* **Zoviz** – I’ve been using it lately for branding-related things (logos, visuals, quick design assets). I’m not a designer, so having something that keeps things consistent without much effort has been helpful.\n\nCurious what everyone else is relying on this year.

I’d log hook, length, topic, and watch/CTR stats per video, then have a separate job that summarizes what actually works and feeds that back into your script prompt as constraints.\n\n\n\nAlso worth splitting the workflow into modular stages: idea sourcing (trending subs/YouTube keywords), script, visual plan, then video. That way you can A/B test hooks and scripts without regenerating the whole thing. I’ve chained things like Make and Zapier with vid tools (e.g., Pika or Runway) and a tracker like Notion/Airtable; Pulse plus keyword alerts and scheduling tools can watch for niche trends and auto-queue new video ideas. Main focus I’d push on: close the loop so the system learns, instead of you handpicking winners forever.",

I’ve played around with a few tools and while it’s easy to get something working on day one, things start breaking once real users show up. Context gets lost, agents behave unpredictably, and edge cases pile up fast.\n\nI’ve seen people mention platforms like ExpertEase AI, AgentHub, CrewAI for simplifying workflows, and agent collaboration, but I wonder how stable it really is at scale. How are you handling monitoring, fallbacks, and version changes without touching code? Are these tools flexible enough when business logic evolves?\n\nMost importantly, what does working in production mean to you? Daily active users? Revenue impact? Low maintenance? I’d love to hear real experiences, not marketing claims. What surprised you the most after launch?",

          "text": "Yeah, I lead a team that builds internal automations. The most important part is being enabled by the company on automation tools that are enterprise grade. For example I use Workato as an IPaaS to integrate with 100s of tools as well as AI and have built more than 10 Automation projects. Because I solving for enterprise business problems and processes, the efficiency gains are high. Last year the near 10 projects have saved about 11k hours of manual work during 2025. \n\nSpecific example: Automating Co-Selling violations process between internal sales reps and our partners. \n\nInternal sales reps are meant to work closely with our partners to cosell our product (for specific deals). There are sales rules of engagement and coselling and breaking them constitute a violation. For example, a communication violation is not communicating with a partner on a deal. There has to be proof that a partner was communicated to and was part of the communication thread. Another violation is mislabelling a deal, saying the partner sourced it but they never did (they say this because it gives them more commissions) etc\n\nThe process for assigning violations to rep involves: identifying the violations and recording them for 1k reps, tracking how long a violation lasts before it expires, if they commit more than one violation in a given month it only counts as one, if they have one violation we give them direct feedback on the CRM, if they commit a second violation we email their manager, if they commit a third violation we involve HR. \n\n2 different people were involved near full time managing such process manually and with so many spreadsheets. All of this is now automated with one person spending few hours a month to prepare the data to be presented to leadership.",

The automations that struggled were framed as efficiency plays instead of risk reduction. Leadership signs off much faster when the pitch is fewer escalations or more consistent decisions, not time saved. Curious what others have seen survive first contact with Legal.",
