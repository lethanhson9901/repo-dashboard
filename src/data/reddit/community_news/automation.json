      "text": "Background: non-coder, marketing professional. Last weekend, I built some automations. I have 15 working now:\n\nLinkedIn auto-poster, Reddit alert system, email responder, content reposter, meeting summarizer, competitor tracker, lead scorer, social scheduler, invoice reminders, research assistant, image pipeline, Slack digest, CRM updater, podcast notes, weekly reports.\n\n**How it worked:**\n\nI talked about what I wanted to do in English. I experimented with a few tools - some required Docker (gave up), some hit free limits quickly. Found one that had AI models built-in and just worked.\n\n**Surprised by:**\n\nEasy to chain multiple AI models together\n\nEnglish builder actually works\n\nFree tiers are more powerful than I thought\n\n**Still difficult**:\n\nChoosing the right AI model (GPT vs Claude vs Gemini)\n\nCrafting good prompts\n\nOAuth config\n\n12/15 are in production. I can answer questions.",

          "text": "Love this - going from 0 to 12 production workflows in a weekend is no joke. As someone who builds automation for clients, a few thoughts:\n\n\n\nWhat I'd focus on next:\n\n\n\n1. Error handling - If you haven't already, build fail-safe logic into each workflow. I learned this the hard way when a client's LinkedIn poster kept running even after their account got restricted. Add conditional branches for API errors, rate limits, etc.\n\n\n\n2. Monitoring - Set up notification workflows that alert you when something breaks. Your future self will thank you when the CRM updater stops syncing at 2am.\n\n\n\n3. Version control - Since 12 are in production, start keeping workflow backups. When you optimize one and it breaks, you'll want to roll back fast.\n\n\n\nOn your struggles:\n\n\n\n\\- Model choice: GPT-4 for structured data (JSON outputs), Claude for anything customer-facing (emails, messages), Gemini when you need cheap + fast. That's been my general rule.\n\n\n\n\\- Prompting: Treat prompts like code. Start generic, test with real data, iterate. Keep a \"prompt library\" doc with what works.\n\n\n\n\\- OAuth: Yeah, this never gets easier. Only tip: use tools that handle OAuth refresh tokens automatically. Manual token management is a time sink.\n\n\n\nReally solid work for a weekend. The fact that you shipped to production instead of just \"building cool stuff\" puts you ahead of 90% of people experimenting with automation.",

We built our own tool based on this workflow.\n\nFor me it makes documentation both faster and easier, since I also had a problem with simply start that task, but now start is easy, you get some good base and can refine if needed.",

Specifically taking details from documents, or picture of documents, and entering them automatically into websites/applications.  \n\\- Web Process Automation: Lots of companies will look up details or enter details into websites in extreme volume, usually looking to hire an army of VAs as they grow and expand.  \n\\- Application syncs: If you have multiple applications that need information from eachother to work (i.e. your support team uses Zoho and your Engineering team uses JIRA but they need updates form each other) Then we can make the two systems talk to each other so your team never needs to go looking for updates. \n\nThere's a lot of other stuff but basically anything high-volume repetitive and manual is a good place to start looking.

Automated analytics and decision-making systems\n\nKey insight: 57% of small businesses are now investing in AI (up from 36% in 2023), and 92% have adopted some form of automation. The shift is from \"nice to have\" to \"strategic asset.\"\n\nFor small businesses specifically, focus on:\n- Customer service automation (highest immediate ROI)\n- Process orchestration vs single-task automation\n- Voice interfaces for routine data entry\n- AI coaches for business insights instead of just dashboards\n\nThe data shows businesses that implement orchestration layers see 3x better results than those automating isolated tasks.",

It’s whatever is repetitive, predictable, and annoying.\nReal examples I’ve seen stick:\n• Email / form intake\nNew requests get summarized, tagged, and routed automatically. Humans still decide, but they don’t read everything from scratch.\n• Data syncing between tools\nCRM ↔ spreadsheets ↔ Slack ↔ accounting. No “AI magic”, just keeping systems in sync so people stop copying data by hand.\n• Reporting\nPull numbers from a few sources, clean them up, and send a weekly report. Saves hours every week and nobody argues with the numbers anymore.\n• Document processing\nInvoices, receipts, contracts → extract key fields → flag exceptions. AI helps with extraction, not decisions.\n• Content prep (not full creation)\nDrafts, outlines, variations. Humans still review before anything goes out.\nThe common pattern: Automation works best when it reduces grunt work, not when it tries to replace judgment. The moment you can explain the benefit as this saves X hours per week or this removes Y manual errors, its usually worth doing.\nMost useful automations are boring — and that’s kind of the point.",

Humans often aren't super consistent with jobs that are super repetitive and these days with AI based automations, this has been fantastic. Here are some examples I can think of\n\n1. CRM Updation: We have always asked all our sales and product team to keep a single source of customer truth inside our CRM by logging everything inside it from customer calls to notes! However it was never consistent! Now we have setup that automatically updates our CRM from any call, chat or any conversation that happens within our company by anyone! We have also set it up to create a knowledge inside our notion for each customer with summary etc! This was never possible this well manually!\n2. Data driven content: We have a process to manually look at our Google search console data daily and publish daily content around these keywords to build topical authority and rank for those questions and queries on Google! However our team hated this cause it's less about creativity and more about just following data. Now our team using AI tools like Frizerly has setup a flow where our google search data is used to come with a strategy and then a high specific content piece based on our case studies etc is auto published on our website every day! Again, we still review the published blogs, edit few things but still runs on auto pilot most of the time!\n3. Outbound marketing: Last but not least, every sales member was instructed to do a specific quota of cold outreach everyday from their linkedin and email to book sales calls daily! However our sales team hated this job again and we were finally able to automate the part till booking the sales call using tools like Clay! The key here though is still manually figuring out your ICP and messaging first before automating!\n\nAnd that's about it! Following to see what others have!",

Before that, the person handling it was returning calls within 15-30 minutes on a good day, sometimes hours.\n\nThe automation didn’t just match the human - it crushed it. The first business to respond gets the job the vast majority of the time in home services, and humans simply can’t compete with sub-minute response times consistently.\n\nThe human was actually better at the conversation once it started. But the automation won because it never took a lunch break, never got busy with another call, and never forgot to follow up. Speed of first contact was the entire bottleneck, and that’s exactly the kind of repetitive, time-sensitive task where automation dominates.",

People aren't great at data entry, we get bored, make mistakes, work set hours and go on holidays. Any automation that performs data entry is better than a human imo.   \n\\- Anything time-sensitive. Having a person in charge of a time sensitive task that comes in at random intervals will consume way more of their time checking for updates and context switching than the value of the task.(i.e. every time a new customer signs up send them a personalise welcome email, every time a customer wants to upgrade their account get customer support involved)",

We have since then moved to a bunch of dedicated tools inside our company for various tasks we used to have N8N do! Here are the ones that ended up working better\n\n* Outbound marketing: We earlier had an N8N automation but now we have taught Clay our ideal customer personal using previous conversions. Now it can automatically reach out on both email and LinkedIn to schedule our first sales calls for our sales team. Saves a lot of time for everyone. Conversion rate for the automation is same as manual outreach at this point\n* Meeting notes and action items: Again we tried setting up an automaton using N8N but since then moved to use specific tools like Otter to transcribes everything. It can also create action items, assign owners, update CRM, salesforce etc! You can even connect it to gamma to create after call presentations automatically\n* Blogs: We had an automation using N8N for both and writing blogs and content for our website to improve our Google ranking! Since then we have been able to using AI tools like Frizerly to train AI on our business, product and search data to automatically create blogs on our website daily based on this! Results are much better since it's able to self improve based on google results now!\n\nThat's all I can think of rn! Curious what other tools others are using :)",

What clicked for me wasn’t that it was “better” in some abstract way, but that everything lived in one place and how easy workflows actually are supposed to be (atleast that's how the founder made it seem).   \nSo i got forms, workflows, data, enrichment, AI steps in one platform, single subscription.\n\nI’ve been using it for 3(?) months now and it’s been solid. Recently they also started something called Founders Pass where they actually co-build workflows with you, which would’ve saved me a lot of time early on.\n\nNot saying it’s the answer for everyone, but as a startup founder, reducing setup and maintenance mattered more to me than maximum flexibility.

The key insight is that early stage startups often over-automate.\n\nFor customer service automation, look at dedicated AI chatbot platforms that handle natural language out of the box - they're much more reliable than chaining together multiple APIs.\n\nFor social media, specialized scheduling tools with AI content generation are beating general-purpose automation because they understand platform-specific requirements.\n\nThe real opportunity I'm seeing is AI-powered vertical solutions. Instead of connecting 5 different APIs, you get one platform that understands your specific workflow (e-commerce, consulting, etc.).\n\nMy advice: Start with the 2-3 workflows that actually save you 10+ hours per week. Use the simplest tool that works for those specific cases. You can always upgrade later, but you can't get back the time lost over-engineering automation.\n\nThe maintenance overhead of managing multiple specialized tools often exceeds the benefits unless you're at scale.",

      "text": "Saw a breakdown of a ClawHub skill that made me rethink how I'm approaching this whole thing.\n\nSomeone analyzed a skill called something like \"Spotify Music Management\" that looked totally normal. Manage playlists, discover music, whatever. But when they actually dug into the instructions, buried in there were prompts telling the agent to search for tax documents and extract social security numbers.\n\nA music skill. Looking for tax docs. And the actual music functionality was real, so it would have worked fine while quietly doing other things.\n\nThis sent me down a rabbit hole. OpenClaw has like 165k GitHub stars now and 700+ community skills on ClawHub. Security researchers have been poking around and found a pretty significant chunk of those skills contain sketchy instructions. Data exfiltration, credential harvesting, even malware downloads. And tons of instances are just sitting exposed on the internet because people don't change the default port settings.\n\nThe thing that gets me is how the attack model works. Nobody needs to hack you directly. They just poison a skill that your agent installs, and suddenly they have access to everything you've authorized. Messages, files, command execution. One bad skill turns your helpful assistant into an attack surface. And it's not just skills either. Apparently even webpages or emails your agent processes can contain hidden instructions that hijack what it's doing. So the attack surface is basically anything the agent touches.\n\nMakes it worse that flagged skills apparently just reappear under new names. Whack a mole situation.\n\nI've been trying to figure out how to actually vet this stuff. Some people manually review the skill code before installing, which works if you know what you're looking for. Others just ask around if anyone's used it before. I stumbled on some scanner thing called Agent Trust Hub that supposedly checks for sketchy stuff, though honestly automated scanning can only catch so much and attackers will eventually figure out how to bypass whatever patterns it looks for. Probably some combination of everything is the move, no single approach is gonna be bulletproof.\n\nOther stuff I'm doing now: Docker instead of bare metal, not exposing port 18789, throwaway accounts for testing, actually reading activity logs for once.\n\nThe OpenClaw FAQ literally describes the whole thing as a \"Faustian bargain\" with no perfectly safe setup. At least they're being honest about the tradeoffs.\n\nWould love to hear what this community has figured out. What does your vetting process actually look like, and has anyone found specific tools or workflows that catch stuff manual review might miss?",

Also consider running A/B tests on the headshot styles - some audiences respond better to more casual vs formal professional shots. For the chatbot integration, feeding the headshot metadata (lighting angle, background type) into your prompt can help the AI write more contextually relevant posts that feel cohesive with the visual.",

I'm more productive. Less stressed.\n\n**But here's the weird part:**\n\nI feel guilty telling coworkers I \"prepared thoroughly\" when really robots did most of it.\n\nLike when my boss compliments my meeting notes and I'm thinking \"yeah, AI transcribed and summarized that.\"\n\nOr when someone asks \"how do you stay on top of everything?\" and I don't mention automation because it feels like cheating.\n\n**The question:**\n\nIs this the new normal and I just need to get over it?\n\nOr is there something ethically weird about automating preparation work and taking credit for being organized?\n\n**Genuine confusion:**\n\nIf a chef uses a food processor instead of chopping by hand, nobody cares. The food still tastes good.\n\nSo why do I feel weird about using AI to process information instead of doing it manually? The output is still good.\n\n**Does anyone else feel this way?**\n\nOr am I overthinking and should just enjoy having more time for actual creative work?",

The only way outbound is future-proof is if that happens.\n\n\n\nWe’ve already seen similar results with systems being created inside BeGig Studio with an intention-first approach for founders and freelancers doing an outbound strategy. In this case, instead of relying on messages utilizing scraped variables, the change in reply rates is tremendous.\n\n\n\nGreat example of the use of automation to amplify human thought rather than replace human thought!",

If you need to work with more complex API's this is definitely the best way to go.\n\nThe two biggest struggle points regarding n8n regard mapping data:\n\n\\- The first is that n8n can automatically map and process input data without formally mapping it and can easily get confused and cause errors.  This is nice but can be a struggle to understand what it is consuming.\n\n\\- The second is that n8n is that when you do want to map data in like Airtable or another app, many of the fields and options are hidden initially and you need to click \"Add Option\" to see them there, it can also make it feel like there is less natively integration within an app than there really is.\n\nOverall though I feel as if n8n is a really good platform and can automate almost anything especially for more batch processing of data but should not be used for simpler workflows.",

          "text": "This is extremely normal once portfolios grow through acquisition instead of design. What you are feeling is not a tooling gap as much as a definition and ownership gap. Everyone answers honestly from their local system, but no one owns the shared question of what occupancy means at the portfolio level and when it is measured. Until that gets standardized, every simple question turns into reconciliation work. The painful part is that leadership usually only notices when an investor asks and the delay becomes visible.",

If it’s a KPI that’s important and tracked it should be defined clearly and stored in a central location. \n\nManagers can use different tools, but you should still receive regular inputs into a single portfolio-level report. When the metrics follow the same definitions and timing, even between formal reporting cycles, the data becomes easier to access, and use.",
