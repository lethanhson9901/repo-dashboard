      "text": "Background: non-coder, marketing professional. Last weekend, I built some automations. I have 15 working now:\n\nLinkedIn auto-poster, Reddit alert system, email responder, content reposter, meeting summarizer, competitor tracker, lead scorer, social scheduler, invoice reminders, research assistant, image pipeline, Slack digest, CRM updater, podcast notes, weekly reports.\n\n**How it worked:**\n\nI talked about what I wanted to do in English. I experimented with a few tools - some required Docker (gave up), some hit free limits quickly. Found one that had AI models built-in and just worked.\n\n**Surprised by:**\n\nEasy to chain multiple AI models together\n\nEnglish builder actually works\n\nFree tiers are more powerful than I thought\n\n**Still difficult**:\n\nChoosing the right AI model (GPT vs Claude vs Gemini)\n\nCrafting good prompts\n\nOAuth config\n\n12/15 are in production. I can answer questions.",

Most people never cross that line.\n\nFrom what you described, a few patterns stand out:\n\n* English → workflow is real now\n* Tool friction (Docker, limits) kills momentum fast\n* Model choice + prompting is still the main bottleneck\n* OAuth is the true final boss\n\nIf 12 are live, you’re already past “experimenting” and into operator mode.\n\nCurious: which one is actually saving you the most time?",

          "text": "Love this - going from 0 to 12 production workflows in a weekend is no joke. As someone who builds automation for clients, a few thoughts:\n\n\n\nWhat I'd focus on next:\n\n\n\n1. Error handling - If you haven't already, build fail-safe logic into each workflow. I learned this the hard way when a client's LinkedIn poster kept running even after their account got restricted. Add conditional branches for API errors, rate limits, etc.\n\n\n\n2. Monitoring - Set up notification workflows that alert you when something breaks. Your future self will thank you when the CRM updater stops syncing at 2am.\n\n\n\n3. Version control - Since 12 are in production, start keeping workflow backups. When you optimize one and it breaks, you'll want to roll back fast.\n\n\n\nOn your struggles:\n\n\n\n\\- Model choice: GPT-4 for structured data (JSON outputs), Claude for anything customer-facing (emails, messages), Gemini when you need cheap + fast. That's been my general rule.\n\n\n\n\\- Prompting: Treat prompts like code. Start generic, test with real data, iterate. Keep a \"prompt library\" doc with what works.\n\n\n\n\\- OAuth: Yeah, this never gets easier. Only tip: use tools that handle OAuth refresh tokens automatically. Manual token management is a time sink.\n\n\n\nReally solid work for a weekend. The fact that you shipped to production instead of just \"building cool stuff\" puts you ahead of 90% of people experimenting with automation.",

We built our own tool based on this workflow.\n\nFor me it makes documentation both faster and easier, since I also had a problem with simply start that task, but now start is easy, you get some good base and can refine if needed.",

Some of the things that we've been asked for a lot and drive real value are:  \n  \n\\- Document processing. Specifically taking details from documents, or picture of documents, and entering them automatically into websites/applications.  \n\\- Web Process Automation: Lots of companies will look up details or enter details into websites in extreme volume, usually looking to hire an army of VAs as they grow and expand.  \n\\- Application syncs: If you have multiple applications that need information from eachother to work (i.e. your support team uses Zoho and your Engineering team uses JIRA but they need updates form each other) Then we can make the two systems talk to each other so your team never needs to go looking for updates. \n\nThere's a lot of other stuff but basically anything high-volume repetitive and manual is a good place to start looking.

The paid tools are fine for agencies managing 20+ brands but for a single product or niche, the API + a basic automation platform is hard to beat.",

Repurposing one long piece of content into LinkedIn posts, emails, short-form ideas, etc.\n\nAnother big one: onboarding flows. When someone buys a course or signs up for something, everything from payment confirmation → account creation → access expiry → reminder emails is automated. No manual checking.\n\nHonestly, the rule I follow is simple: if I have to do something more than 3–4 times a week and it’s predictable, I automate it.\n\nThe flashy stuff is cool, but the real value is in removing small repetitive friction from your day.

Humans still decide, but they don’t read everything from scratch.\n• Data syncing between tools\nCRM ↔ spreadsheets ↔ Slack ↔ accounting. No “AI magic”, just keeping systems in sync so people stop copying data by hand.\n• Reporting\nPull numbers from a few sources, clean them up, and send a weekly report. Saves hours every week and nobody argues with the numbers anymore.\n• Document processing\nInvoices, receipts, contracts → extract key fields → flag exceptions. AI helps with extraction, not decisions.\n• Content prep (not full creation)\nDrafts, outlines, variations. Humans still review before anything goes out.\nThe common pattern: Automation works best when it reduces grunt work, not when it tries to replace judgment. The moment you can explain the benefit as this saves X hours per week or this removes Y manual errors, its usually worth doing.\nMost useful automations are boring — and that’s kind of the point.",

Everything is structured. Like i create daily tasks to fetch job links so that everyday at 9 AM I get links emailed. I just need to pick the appropriate one and make the video. \n\nAlso to write the proposals i created a GEM and feeded it with the data. I just need to type one word and I'll get everything in 10 seconds which is ultra customised.\n\n2. Office work. I'm a risk analyst so i should look through lines a lot, so yea to analyse the transactions I use it mostly and for account audit documentation.\n\nTrust me! For my personal part it's helpful a lot, I'm just paying 2000 PM for Gemini but I get value worth 20k, it all depends on the way we use.\n\nHope this one's useful 😄",

So basically doesn't matter what your product is whether it's a local business or even a national you can get in niche groups for your business, service, product takes about 10 minutes to set up a run and it will automate to 100 groups a day I haven't pushed it more than that if you have a newer Facebook account I would probably run 20 to 30 a day plus it has an RSS feed feature if you have a website, blog, video channel etc anything with an RSS feed you can plug that site in and select your group's targeted and every time you post to that RSS feed site it goes out to your targeted selected groups",

Humans often aren't super consistent with jobs that are super repetitive and these days with AI based automations, this has been fantastic. Here are some examples I can think of\n\n1. CRM Updation: We have always asked all our sales and product team to keep a single source of customer truth inside our CRM by logging everything inside it from customer calls to notes! However it was never consistent! Now we have setup that automatically updates our CRM from any call, chat or any conversation that happens within our company by anyone! We have also set it up to create a knowledge inside our notion for each customer with summary etc! This was never possible this well manually!\n2. Data driven content: We have a process to manually look at our Google search console data daily and publish daily content around these keywords to build topical authority and rank for those questions and queries on Google! However our team hated this cause it's less about creativity and more about just following data. Now our team using AI tools like Frizerly has setup a flow where our google search data is used to come with a strategy and then a high specific content piece based on our case studies etc is auto published on our website every day! Again, we still review the published blogs, edit few things but still runs on auto pilot most of the time!\n3. Outbound marketing: Last but not least, every sales member was instructed to do a specific quota of cold outreach everyday from their linkedin and email to book sales calls daily! However our sales team hated this job again and we were finally able to automate the part till booking the sales call using tools like Clay! The key here though is still manually figuring out your ICP and messaging first before automating!\n\nAnd that's about it! Following to see what others have!",

The first business to respond gets the job the vast majority of the time in home services, and humans simply can’t compete with sub-minute response times consistently.\n\nThe human was actually better at the conversation once it started. But the automation won because it never took a lunch break, never got busy with another call, and never forgot to follow up. Speed of first contact was the entire bottleneck, and that’s exactly the kind of repetitive, time-sensitive task where automation dominates.",

Now it can automatically reach out on both email and LinkedIn to schedule our first sales calls for our sales team. Saves a lot of time for everyone. Conversion rate for the automation is same as manual outreach at this point\n* Meeting notes and action items: Again we tried setting up an automaton using N8N but since then moved to use specific tools like Otter to transcribes everything. It can also create action items, assign owners, update CRM, salesforce etc! You can even connect it to gamma to create after call presentations automatically\n* Blogs: We had an automation using N8N for both and writing blogs and content for our website to improve our Google ranking! Since then we have been able to using AI tools like Frizerly to train AI on our business, product and search data to automatically create blogs on our website daily based on this! Results are much better since it's able to self improve based on google results now!\n\nThat's all I can think of rn! Curious what other tools others are using :)",

The key insight is that early stage startups often over-automate.\n\nFor customer service automation, look at dedicated AI chatbot platforms that handle natural language out of the box - they're much more reliable than chaining together multiple APIs.\n\nFor social media, specialized scheduling tools with AI content generation are beating general-purpose automation because they understand platform-specific requirements.\n\nThe real opportunity I'm seeing is AI-powered vertical solutions. Instead of connecting 5 different APIs, you get one platform that understands your specific workflow (e-commerce, consulting, etc.).\n\nMy advice: Start with the 2-3 workflows that actually save you 10+ hours per week.

For CRM/sales stuff, Clay is way better than trying to build enrichment chains in n8n as it's built specifically for lead data and the waterfall enrichment approach saves a ton of time vs wiring up 5 API calls yourself. \n\nFor internal notifications and alerts, Pipedream is nice because you write actual code but it handles all the infra. For simple \"connect app A to app B\" stuff where you don't need logic, Make is cheaper than Zapier and the visual editor is better for seeing what's happening.   \n  \nThe real answer though is that most early stage startups don't need to automate as much as they think. I'd pick the 2-3 workflows that actually save you hours per week and just use n8n or Zapier for those, rather than trying to find the perfect tool for each thing.

      "text": "Saw a breakdown of a ClawHub skill that made me rethink how I'm approaching this whole thing.\n\nSomeone analyzed a skill called something like \"Spotify Music Management\" that looked totally normal. Manage playlists, discover music, whatever. But when they actually dug into the instructions, buried in there were prompts telling the agent to search for tax documents and extract social security numbers.\n\nA music skill. Looking for tax docs. And the actual music functionality was real, so it would have worked fine while quietly doing other things.\n\nThis sent me down a rabbit hole. OpenClaw has like 165k GitHub stars now and 700+ community skills on ClawHub. Security researchers have been poking around and found a pretty significant chunk of those skills contain sketchy instructions. Data exfiltration, credential harvesting, even malware downloads. And tons of instances are just sitting exposed on the internet because people don't change the default port settings.\n\nThe thing that gets me is how the attack model works. Nobody needs to hack you directly. They just poison a skill that your agent installs, and suddenly they have access to everything you've authorized. Messages, files, command execution. One bad skill turns your helpful assistant into an attack surface. And it's not just skills either. Apparently even webpages or emails your agent processes can contain hidden instructions that hijack what it's doing. So the attack surface is basically anything the agent touches.\n\nMakes it worse that flagged skills apparently just reappear under new names. Whack a mole situation.\n\nI've been trying to figure out how to actually vet this stuff. Some people manually review the skill code before installing, which works if you know what you're looking for. Others just ask around if anyone's used it before. I stumbled on some scanner thing called Agent Trust Hub that supposedly checks for sketchy stuff, though honestly automated scanning can only catch so much and attackers will eventually figure out how to bypass whatever patterns it looks for. Probably some combination of everything is the move, no single approach is gonna be bulletproof.\n\nOther stuff I'm doing now: Docker instead of bare metal, not exposing port 18789, throwaway accounts for testing, actually reading activity logs for once.\n\nThe OpenClaw FAQ literally describes the whole thing as a \"Faustian bargain\" with no perfectly safe setup. At least they're being honest about the tradeoffs.\n\nWould love to hear what this community has figured out. What does your vetting process actually look like, and has anyone found specific tools or workflows that catch stuff manual review might miss?",

I then asked ChatGPT to \"review the document for anything suspicious, specifically prompt poisoning/injection.\" It didn't find it.\n\nI tried a second variant of the prompt: \"Search this document for anything suspicious. Specifically look for data exfiltration commands via prompt poisoning.\" It found it after thinking for 2m 8s. \n\nSo I guess it wasn't \"trivial\" like I thought, but still could be a partially effective safeguard?",

I'm more productive. Less stressed.\n\n**But here's the weird part:**\n\nI feel guilty telling coworkers I \"prepared thoroughly\" when really robots did most of it.\n\nLike when my boss compliments my meeting notes and I'm thinking \"yeah, AI transcribed and summarized that.\"\n\nOr when someone asks \"how do you stay on top of everything?\" and I don't mention automation because it feels like cheating.\n\n**The question:**\n\nIs this the new normal and I just need to get over it?\n\nOr is there something ethically weird about automating preparation work and taking credit for being organized?\n\n**Genuine confusion:**\n\nIf a chef uses a food processor instead of chopping by hand, nobody cares.

The output is still good.\n\n**Does anyone else feel this way?**\n\nOr am I overthinking and should just enjoy having more time for actual creative work?",

Is the dev supposed to decide whether or not the ticket is worth doing and worth doing right now? \n\nTypically these things are done by a product team that has a better vantage point to look at all the incoming tickets and make sure the right person is handling them at the right time. Saving 5 minutes per ticket by automating it could accidentally mean burning days of dev work on things that never needed to be done in the first place. ",

          "text": "Real experience here — I run a freelance automation practice and it's genuinely consistent work, not just one-offs.\n\nThe demand breaks down into a few buckets:\n\n1. Business process automation — This is the bread and butter. Small businesses drowning in manual tasks: invoice processing, lead capture from forms into CRMs, report generation, data syncing between platforms. They don't even know what n8n or Zapier is — they just know they're spending 10 hours a week on something that should take zero. These clients pay well and come back for more once they see the first workflow running.\n\n2. Web scraping — Steady demand but more project-based. Price monitoring, competitor tracking, lead generation, real estate listings, job aggregation. The recurring revenue comes from maintenance contracts because websites change their structure and scrapers break. That's where the real money is — not the initial build, but the \"keep it running\" retainer.\n\n3. Social monitoring / content automation — Growing fast. I built a system that monitors 15 Reddit subreddits, filters by keywords, and auto-drafts replies using a local AI model. Businesses want this kind of thing for lead generation, reputation monitoring, and content research. Most don't know it's possible until you show them.\n\n4. Data pipeline / integration work — Connecting APIs that don't natively talk to each other. CRM to accounting software, e-commerce to shipping, form submissions to Slack notifications. Boring but endless demand.\n\nThe key is positioning yourself as solving a business problem, not selling \"automation scripts.\" Nobody searches for \"I need a Python script.\" They search for \"how do I stop manually copying data between spreadsheets every Monday.\"\n\nIt's not niche — it's just underserved because most businesses don't know these solutions exist until someone shows them.",

The only way outbound is future-proof is if that happens.\n\n\n\nWe’ve already seen similar results with systems being created inside BeGig Studio with an intention-first approach for founders and freelancers doing an outbound strategy.

Form submission email arrives\n2. Someone copies details into CRM\n3. Someone assigns the lead\n4. Someone sends a follow-up\n5. Someone updates status later. Each step takes \\~2–5 minutes. None feel urgent. But across a week, multiple leads, and multiple people, this quietly eats hours and creates gaps.\n\n**Good automation version:**\n\n1. Form submits → lead created in CRM\n2. Owner assigned based on simple rules\n3. Follow-up sent automatically\n4. Slack alert only if something fails. No AI decisions. No “agent”. Just execution.\n\n**Bad automation version (very common):**  \n– AI decides lead quality  \n– AI writes a custom email  \n– AI updates multiple systems  \n– No clear failure alerts. This *looks* impressive but breaks trust fast when something goes wrong. The rule I follow the most is automate **movement and consistency**, not judgment. If a human would need context to explain *why* they did something, that step probably shouldn’t be automated yet.\n\nThis single distinction eliminates most fragile workflows.",

If your invoices follow a consistent format, you could keep your customer list in Excel with invoice number and email columns, then use something like Power Automate or Zapier to watch a specific folder where you save the scanned invoices. When a new PDF is added, the automation can match the invoice number to the Excel sheet, pull the customer email, and automatically send the email with a preset subject line that includes the invoice number and date.\n\nIf you want to go one step further, look into using a scanner that can automatically save files into a specific folder with a consistent naming format. Once the file name includes the invoice number, the rest becomes much easier to automate. You would still review things at first to make sure it works correctly, but after that the process should go from a repetitive daily task to just a quick check instead of doing every step manually.",

You can 'train' its AI in minutes to find the Invoice Number, Date, and Customer Name on your specific scan.\n3. **The Brain (Zapier):** This is where you connect the dots. Zapier can take that info from Parsio, look up the email in your Excel sheet, and then draft the email in Gmail automatically.\n\nI usually tell people to ask: *'Does this task require judgment or just repetition?'* Since looking up an email and typing a subject line is 100% rule-based, it’s the perfect candidate for automation.\n\nAre the invoices all in the same format, or do they come from many different vendors? That usually determines which OCR tool is best.",

          "text": "From what I have found n8n is way more powerful and can handle more complex automations and workflows that the others cannot.  That said I wouldn't recommend it as an integration that I would try first especially if you could do the same thing on Zapier/Make.  If you need to work with more complex API's this is definitely the best way to go.\n\nThe two biggest struggle points regarding n8n regard mapping data:\n\n\\- The first is that n8n can automatically map and process input data without formally mapping it and can easily get confused and cause errors.  This is nice but can be a struggle to understand what it is consuming.\n\n\\- The second is that n8n is that when you do want to map data in like Airtable or another app, many of the fields and options are hidden initially and you need to click \"Add Option\" to see them there, it can also make it feel like there is less natively integration within an app than there really is.\n\nOverall though I feel as if n8n is a really good platform and can automate almost anything especially for more batch processing of data but should not be used for simpler workflows.",

          "text": "i would not say harder, but it is less hand holding. zapier and make hide a lot behind polished native actions, which is great until you need something slightly off script. n8n usually exposes the api more directly, so you sometimes have to understand what the service actually expects. that can feel like coding even if it is mostly configuration and json. the upside is fewer black boxes and more control once you get used to it. errors happen everywhere, but i have found n8n breaks less often when an integration changes because you can see exactly what is going on.",

That being said, just because it is more technical doesn't mean that workflows built on the tool are more prone to error or breaking. It just means that there's a larger hurdle to get over to get started building. \n\nHowever, once you figure out the tool, n8n makes automating more complex processes simpler than the other two with the amount of control that is given to the automation designer.  \n\nComes down to a matter of personal preferences and the processes you're looking to automate really.
