(got my account banned pretty quick on an tool i used a year ago)\n\nA lot of them use Chrome extensions that basically inject code into LinkedIn's page. LinkedIn can spot that pretty easily, and that's usually where people get flagged.\n\nThe tool I use now runs everything in the cloud (not through the browser) and uses residential IPs, so it just looks like you're using your phone or laptop normally. Been using it for a few months now, no issues at all.\n\nThat said, regardless of what you use, what i learnt is: Don't go crazy with volume, do a warmup of you LK account. Personalize stuff (first name, company, whatever makes sense) with custom variables and don't spam people with links in the first messages, engage for real. Anyway, hope that helps!",

So recently someone had shared how their dental practice was often getting mentioned by ChatGPT and Google AI overview after they automated the process of looking at their google data, finding out questions their customers were searching for on Google and then automatically publish blogs on their website answering those exact questions using AI tools like Frizerly! This honestly felt like would not worked, but has actually given us similar results!\n\nI guess it really depends on how competitive your industry is! We dint really have big competitors in our field doing! So we very quickly became the top results for almost every question! Our website is also pretty old, so that probably helped with authority as well! I am curious to understand how this would work out as everyone adopts these automation- at that point its probably a war between AIs and the best AI wins probably haha!",

A lot of data centres currently offset loans against a future sell on value of the GPUs. \n- data centres are often seen as a future investment - e.g. if the company went down, the physical data centre, the wires in the ground etc are still a useful asset. \n- Solar storms seem to offer a threat that would be not present in a traditional data centre, and might increase hardware failure rates over time. \n\nI don’t know if the economics of the solar power and potential for heat dissipation outweigh these significantly, but it seems very wasteful unless the expected shelf life of space data centres is some how longer. It feels like these would be sent up and then just left to die ands replaced with others. \n\nI know xAI had some huge fights over the gas turbines they needed to install to fuel their expedited data centre builds, so maybe energy generation is something that musk and others are especially focused on as they try to scale.",

      "text": "Headline is the question.\n\nMost automations we’ve created work great at the beginning. Then you put them on a daily schedule and the cracks show up fast. A website changes a small thing. An auth flow expires. A script succeeds but returns partial data. Suddenly the automation is still “running” but the output is quietly wrong. You only notice weeks later when numbers stop making sense. Debugging after the fact is way harder than building the thing in the first place.\n\nFor me, the biggest pain point has always been anything that touches the web. Scraping, form filling, pulling data from dashboards. It is rarely the logic that fails, it is the environment. I started treating web interaction as infrastructure instead of just another step in the workflow. Using more controlled browser execution, including experimenting with tools like hyperbrowser, reduced a lot of silent failures because the behavior was more consistent run to run.\n\nCurious how others here think about resilience. Do you add more checks and alerts? Snapshot outputs and diff them? Or do you just accept that automations need regular babysitting once they leave the prototype stage?",

Basically, I treat the data as 'guilty until proven innocent.'\nInstead of just checking 'Did the script finish?', I add a logic node at the end that asks:\n1. Is the payload size reasonable? (e.g., If I usually get 50 items and today I got 2, force a fail).\n2. Are critical fields populated? (If 'price' or 'date' is empty, don't write to the DB).\nI'd rather have the automation error out and stop running than pollute my database with partial/bad data that I have to clean up later.",

Treating the browser layer as it's own unstable service that needs redundancy checks. What helped me was adding screenshot comparisons on failure states, and honestly? Eventually stumbled on Actionbook to handle the action manuals + DOM caching stuff, which cut down those \"element not found\" flakes by like 90%. Still fails sometimes, but now it's usually for real reasons, not just random noise.\n\nDo you snapshot your output data and diff it daily?

We also have a centralized repo of customer info automatically created. We have used tools like Zapier and N8N to basically set this up\n* Daily Content Creation: We earlier used to hire freelancers on Upwork to analyze our Google data and come up with topics and content to write blogs on our website! Thanks to LLMs and AI tools like Frizerly, the whole process is now automated! It's able to look at Google analytics and automatically come up with both a strategy and content and post it directly on our website with content specifically trained on our product and case studies!\n* Translations: Again, before LLMs, we had to hire freelancers to translate content because we need most of our content in both english and French! Now we have an automation that auto translates all our content from English behind the scenes!\n\nFollowing to see what others have it going :)",

Now they can actually understand what customers are asking and give useful answers instead of \"sorry I didn't understand that, please rephrase.\"\n\nData extraction from messy documents also got way easier. Before you needed perfect templates or regex hell. Now you just throw PDFs at an LLM and ask for specific fields in JSON. Works on varying formats without rewriting rules every time.\n\nReal improvement though is anything involving understanding unstructured text - summarizing, categorizing, extracting intent. That stuff was either impossible or required tons of manual work before. Now it's an API call.",

Before GenAI, automating this process required training a model for each document type and often broke down when documents didn’t follow the format it was trained on. Now, with tools powered by LLMs, the whole process is faster, smarter, and way more flexible.\n\nFor instance, platforms like kudra ai (affiliated) use AI to extract data from unstructured documents, think contracts, invoices, or even shipping manifests, and turn it into structured, searchable information in seconds. What’s cool is that the AI actually understands the context, so it works even if the document formatting is non-standard or the language is nuanced. Plus, you can build custom workflows to not just extract data but also analyze it, which saves a ton of time for industries like finance, logistics, and legal.\n\nSo yeah, I’d say document handling is one area that’s gone from “meh automation” to “crazy efficient” thanks to GenAI.",

But I burned through my entire $20 monthly quota just generating one 2-minute video. Couldn't even go back and iterate on it without waiting for the next billing cycle.\n\nTried moving to VS Code to keep editing but the whole flow felt broken at that point.\n\nI got curious about how the whole thing actually works. Spent a few hours digging into Remotion, understanding how Claude was orchestrating everything, and ended up building my own agent that does something similar.\n\nBeen using it for the past few weeks to make explainer videos and product demos. Still rough around the edges but it works. I can actually iterate now without watching my credits disappear.\n\nI never really cracked motion graphics before this. Tried After Effects, tried Canva videos, tried a bunch of other tools. Nothing stuck. The Claude + Remotion combo was the first time I actually finished a video I was happy with. So when the credits ran out I just wanted to keep that going.\n\nAnyway, mostly posting to see if anyone else ran into the same quota problem or if people are even interested in prompt-to-video stuff outside of the Claude ecosystem. Curious what others are building.",

I started a tech agency a year ago instead of sitting for placements.\n\n**The Situation:** I have the tech stack, the IP, and a proven model. We are projected to do \\~50-60L ($60k–$70k) in revenue this year with about 30 high-paying clients. I have a small sales team across India and the US, but our bottleneck is scale.\n\n**The Deal:** I have an opportunity to partner with a larger company that dominates distribution in my niche. They want 50% economical ownership of my company. In exchange, I get immediate access to their massive network and distribution channels.\n\n**The Dilemma:**\n\n1. **The Upside:** We could grow exponentially faster using their network.\n2. **The Downside:** I lose 50% equity and control. If I say no, they might become a direct competitor.\n3. **The Trust Issue:** My co-founder and family do not trust this partner. My gut says the distribution is worth it, but their instincts are making me hesitate.\n\n**The Question:** Is it worth giving up 50% equity for guaranteed distribution? Or should I grind it out independently with my own sales team (slower growth, 100% control) and risk fighting them as a competitor?\n\nHas anyone here taken a 50/50 distribution deal, and did you regret it?",

Join and check other community groups. 50% sounds like a lot and if your partner has been trustworthy, I would trust him. You should look at other options before settling.\n\nIs there anyway you could consult with someone  else who has a network that is worth less than 50% equity of your company? You said you have a proven scalable method. Anyway, you could interest them in a smaller portion of equity or another type of shareholder value to your company with different rights…even looking at possible different terms of that with lower ownership equity amount…\n\nJust some solutions from a quick review with Claude:\n\nAlternative Structures to Explore\nDon’t accept their first offer. Here are better frameworks:\n1. Revenue Share Partnership (No Equity)\n\t∙\tThey get 20-30% of revenue from clients they source\n\t∙\tYou retain 100% equity and control\n\t∙\tTime-bound agreement (2-3 years) with performance milestones\n\t∙\tLower risk, maintains optionality\n\n2. Tiered Equity with Vesting\n\t∙\tStart with 20% equity tied to performance milestones\n\t∙\tEarn up to 50% only if they deliver X revenue over Y timeframe\n\t∙\tIncludes buyback provisions if relationship fails\n\t∙\tProtects you from giving equity for empty promises\n\n3. Strategic Investment Model\n\t∙\tThey invest capital at a fair valuation for 25-30% equity\n\t∙\tYou use capital to build your own distribution team\n\t∙\tThey provide intros/network access without operational control\n\t∙\tCleaner cap table, maintains your control\n\n4. Joint Venture Structure\n\t∙\tCreate a separate entity for the partnership (60/40 or 70/30 in your favor)\n\t∙\tYour tech company remains independent\n\t∙\tJV licenses your IP, they contribute distribution\n\t∙\tLimits downside, protects your core asset\n\nMy Recommendation: Structured Counter-Proposal\n\nStep 1: Test Their Commitment\nPropose a 90-day pilot partnership:\n\t∙\tNo equity exchanged\n\t∙\tThey source clients, you deliver service\n\t∙\tRevenue split: 70/30 (you/them) on pilot clients\n\t∙\tBoth parties evaluate fit before discussing equity\nThis reveals:\n\t∙\tWhether their distribution is real or overhyped\n\t∙\tHow they operate as partners\n\t∙\tWhether the relationship has cultural fit\n\nStep 2: Negotiate from Data\nIf pilot works, come back with:\n\t∙\t25% equity (not 50%) with 4-year vesting tied to revenue milestones\n\t∙\tProtective provisions: Board seat, drag-along rights, IP protection clauses\n\t∙\tBuyback option: If they don’t hit milestones, you can repurchase equity at predetermined valuation\n\t∙\tNon-compete agreement: They cannot build competing tech for X years\n\nStep 3: Build Alternatives Simultaneously\nWhile negotiating:\n\t∙\tInvest heavily in YOUR sales team and distribution\n\t∙\tExplore other potential distribution partners\n\t∙\tDocument your IP and consider defensive patents/trademarks\n\t∙\tBuild leverage by showing you don’t need them, you’re just open to acceleration",

Humans can’t be at their desks 24/7, but the AI doesn't get \"burnout\" after 50 calls or take a 1-hour lunch break right when a high-intent lead rings.\n\nIt’s less about \"persuasion\" and more about availability.\n\nOne thing though, how are you handling the data sync? Are you feeding the AI summaries back into your CRM automatically? I’ve found that the real \"magic\" happens when the human rep jumps on the follow-up call already knowing exactly what the lead’s pain point is because they read the AI’s notes first.",

Whether that’s AI, a human, or a hybrid matters less than eliminating missed calls and slow response times.\nA cheap call center can absolutely work too, but only if the handoff, follow-ups, and tracking are actually tight. In a lot of small teams, that’s where things break.\nFrom what I’ve seen, the sales lift often comes from removing leakage, not from “AI selling better.”",

          "text": "Perhaps you're right... Perhaps AI is useless for \"the $1M-$5M business operator,\", or perhaps just for your specific use case scenario at this time. \n\nThis is likely a workflow issue for your specific situation. Not a true indication of AI viability at that level of structure. \n\nSince every business is different, and ever busines builder is different, every AI use case will likely be different as well. Hell, I made the top 3% of usage on ChatGPT as a soloist last year. I've done over 60k pages worth of material in the last three years, and I am not even using it to write these responses. :)\n\nSo it just truly matters what you are using it for, what your workflows and your specific needs are like. If you already have a well-defined workflow, have eliminated unnecessary tasks, and have streamlined before using AI, then yeah, it might not help you as much.\n\nI would still wager there are steps that could still be more optimal or enhanced through the use of AI that could, in fact, be implemented. You simply might not be implementing those types of tasks yet. \n\nThere will always be tradeoff points for hiring vs using a new tool. Whether you are talking AI or a new video editor, someone has to take time to learn the new tool before becoming proficient with it. That's the nature of the beast. So yes, there will always be a bit of a back and forth on this concept of \"easier to onboard new staff\" than to revamp your entire workflow. \n\nPersonally, when it comes to AI, I actually slow down at times because of issues such as AI slop. Not all AI usage has to be ultr-fast, redundant, crap. So there must be a balance even with AI.\n\nAs for \"TL;DR Someone needs to build boring, focused AI tooling for the $1M–$5M operator, we're the most underserved market in tech.\"\n\nYou could always build this. This is often how things get started. You are the best person to know what you are looking for. Many of the solutions I have developed over the years (4 decades of Dev Work), have almost always been custom solutions that I needed. There's a bit of a Dev roadmap that makes life a lot easier in the process, but many large-scale companies started as a single software tool. \n\nMany of these tools started as fixes to problems, often recurring problems. They were fixed, but often never meant to become products in the first place. \n\nWhat’s different now is the scope of what’s expected. You’re not just writing code anymore. You’re juggling systems, automation, testing, deployment, infra, security, and now AI on top of all of that. None of that is wrong, but the tooling landscape feels polarized. You either get lightweight hacker tools or massive enterprise platforms that assume layers of staff and process.\n\nThe $1M–$5M operator is stuck in the middle. They don’t need flashy innovation. They need boring, opinionated tools that reduce friction and cognitive load, standardize the obvious stuff, and let people focus on the work. “Boring” is kind of the point, and calm systems beat clever ones when you’re trying to run an actual business.\n\nIf you’re already operating in that space, you’re probably in a better position than most vendors to assemble something focused that actually reduces friction instead of adding another platform to manage.\n\nAs a developer, it could take me months to fully flesh out the industry that you are in ona level that would truly \"impact that market sector\". I wrote custom call center software for years; that's a highly specific industry. But I was in that industry to begin with. You have the built-in experience, knowledge, and understanding of your needs better than an outside developer would. \n\nIf you were to build the framework, based on the needs and functions that you required, then you could hand that off to developers and have it built.",

People change their mind mid sentence, give partial info, or answer a different question than the one you asked, and the agent has to keep a clean thread of what is confirmed vs assumed. Name and email capture is also deceptively hard because you need a confirmation loop that does not feel robotic, plus a fallback like spelling or SMS verification when confidence is low.\n\nCalendar sync issues tend to be less frequent but more damaging when they happen, especially time zones, double booking, and stale availability. The systems that feel reliable are the ones that treat every external call as “may fail” and have a graceful recovery path that does not lose the user or create phantom bookings. I’m curious how you’re handling the confirm step, is it explicit at the end or incremental confirmations as you go?",

Incremental confirmations: Instead of waiting until the end, I confirm critical fields as they come up — e.g., Just to confirm, did you say 3 PM on Thursday? This keeps the thread clean and avoids compounding errors.\n2. Confidence-based fallbacks: For names, emails or dates, if the model isn’t confident, trigger a polite clarification or an SMS/email verification loop. This keeps it human-like but accurate.\n3. Resilient calendar logic: Treat every API call as potentially failing. Implement retries, double-booking checks, time zone normalization and a fallback message if availability can’t be confirmed.\n4. Threaded state tracking: Maintain a clear confirmed vs. assumed map for every interaction. This way, even mid-sentence changes or partial answers don’t break the workflow.\nThe combination of incremental confirmation + confidence checks + robust API handling is what makes the system feel reliable in real-world chaos.\nIf anyone is stuck with this, I’m happy to share a practical pattern for implementing it in a voice-agent workflow.",

Over-confirming can tank flow just as fast as under-confirming. Curious how you decide which fields are hard gates and which ones can stay tentative until the end.",

But there are technical ways to handle it.\n​To ensure timing, you need to master Reddit’s search parameters, like sorting by 'relevance' or 'new' and limiting the time range with 't=hour'. From what we've seen, using 'sort=new' usually pulls in way too much trash, so finding the right balance is key. In Huntopic, I pair these specific settings with a database-level deduplication layer to discard anything already seen before any analysis happens.\n​For filtering, instead of relying on keywords alone, an intent-validation pipeline is essential. It focuses on identifying actual pain points or buying signals while filtering out generic discussions.\n​What stack are you using for this automation, or are you looking for an out-of-the-box solution that already handles this?",

Drop your audio files into a Dropbox or Google Drive folder, and the automation picks them up, sends them to Whisper for transcription, then saves the output with a matching filename. You can add a second step that runs the transcript through GPT to clean up filler words, fix punctuation, and format into proper paragraphs.\n\nFor organising the files, a naming convention like YYYYMMDD_clientname_topic.mp3 saves you a lot of pain later. If you sort by subfolders (one per client or project), the automation can tag transcripts based on where they came from, which makes searching through them way easier down the line.\n\nOne thing to watch: Whisper has a 25MB file limit and accuracy drops on very long recordings. If your interviews run over an hour, chunk them before sending. The API costs about $0.006 per minute, so a full hour comes out to roughly $0.36. At that price the bottleneck is really just the manual review for proper nouns and industry terms, which usually takes a fraction of the time compared to transcribing from scratch.",

I’d build a solid agent on Vapi or Bland or Retell, the demo is great, and then I lose way more time on everything around it \nthan on the agent itself. Designing the flow, connecting integrations to the client tools, \ndealing with edge cases, and then debugging the glue (n8n / zapier / webhooks) every time \nsomething breaks or just act different in prod. At some point I realized I wasn’t really selling \n“a voice agent”, I was selling a fragile stack. \n\n\nWhat changed for me is PearlVibe from nlpearl.ai, because it builds the flow AND the \nintegrations automatically. Instead of building an agent here, a workflow there, and \nconnecting everything with external automation tools, I can literally describe the workflow in chat like “qualify the caller + Integrate with my google sheet drive, if they’re qualified create/update the google sheet, send a summary to the team, book a meeting with google cal, and if it’s support open a ticket” and PearlVibe turns that into something deployable with the logic + integrations already wired. For me that’s the big difference. Less tools, less glue, less debugging, faster iterations so faster deployments.\n\n\nAnd the other part that makes it actually sellable long term (not just a cool demo) is \nanalytics. Clients want visibility. Being able to see conversions, sentiment analysis, drop off, \nand where the flow gets stuck changes the whole convo. It becomes optimization + ROI, not “wow the bot talks”. \n\n\nResult is I spend way less time wiring / troubleshooting and way more time shipping \nworkflows clients actually keep using.

Lead generation - scraping business directories, enriching contact info, sending personalized outreach sequences. Most teams do this manually and it takes 10+ hours per week.\n\n2. Competitor intelligence - monitoring competitors social engagement and turning commenters into warm lead lists. Much better conversion than cold databases.\n\n3. Document generation - proposals, reports, invoices that auto-fill from CRM data. The ROI on this one is instant and visible.\n\nThe clients that actually pay are businesses doing 3M to 10M per year.
