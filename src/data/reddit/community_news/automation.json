They're everywhere on TikTok and Instagram.\n\nI was manually creating these for a faceless channel and the workflow was painful:  \n\\- Write script  \n\\- Generate voice for character 1  \n\\- Generate voice for character 2  \n\\- Sync the dialogue timing  \n\\- Add captions frame by frame  \n\\- Add sound effects  \n\\- Export and add metadata\n\nTook 2+ hours per video. So I built AutoClips to automate the entire pipeline.\n\n**What's automated now:**\n\n1. **Script generation** \\- Enter topic, AI writes dialogue for both characters\n2. **Multi-voice synthesis** \\- Each character gets their own AI voice, automatically synced\n3. **Caption timing** \\- Word-by-word captions generated from audio timestamps\n4. **Sound effects** \\- AI suggests and places sound effects per scene\n5. **metadata** \\- Auto-generates title, description, tags, hashtags\n6. **Cloud rendering** \\- Video renders serverless, no local resources needed\n\n**The stack:**  \n\\- GPT-5.2/Opus 4.5 for script writing  \n\\- ElevenLabs + RVC for voice generation/cloning  \n\\- Whisper for audio transcription/timing  \n\\- Remotion for video composition  \n\\- Azure serverless for rendering\n\nNow it takes \\~3 minutes from topic to finished video.\n\nHappy to talk about the automation architecture if anyone's interested.",

Tools like Zapier and n8n won’t help.\n\nDepending on how much $$ you or your client are willing to spend. Start  with something simple like enabling a data warehouse (my recommendation is ClickHouse either locally on a computer in docker OR as ClickHouse SaaS - this a performant db that will take care of all performance bottlenecks you haven’t imagined hitting yet) and enabling Python in some kind of maintenable architecture (Google/chatgpt medallion architecture in ClickHouse). You will then need some kind of visualisation layer - excel, PowerBI (if you already have license) / Apache Superset (as docker free or search “Preset BI” for SaaS). You will find yourself otherwise highly limited by anything like n8n or Zapier.",

That’s cool, guess he hasn’t learned you know how to teach yourself shit and even ask questions to the community for assistance. We will be right here waiting for you, if you need anything, but go learn how to build up your first Proposal and make sure you set up milestones or deliverable payment terms. \n\nFor instance if the client only wants to pay you until the product is delivered, well what’s stopping him/her for saying it’s not of their standard, or adds additional requirements, and most certainly the common one is it’s more of a shit show and not as easy for some reason or another to get things working. Let’s just blame humans, so any extra time you spend working on something you estimated would take 8 hours on, because that’s what you budgeted, would then eat into your expected profit. \n\nThe point is, it’s awesome you are getting an early start, but your question you originally asked is not your problem, no sir, your problem is now the uncertainly of humans and their implied value of self worth, expecting more for less.

So we setup an automation using AI tools like Frizerly that is fully trained on our company and product context to automatically look at search queries and trends on Google to auto publish useful blogs answering these questions on our website. For example: \"What is the best tool for small businesses to automate invoice followups for customers?\" etc!

SDK / hosted / workflow tools, and\n3. all-in-one platform.\n\nTo go into a little more detail:\n1. Write a while loop with tools. See 'I think “agent” may finally have a widely enough agreed upon definition to be useful jargon now' by Simon Willison and 'Everyone write and agent' by Fly.\n2. Someone else writes the 'agent harness' (read: the loop and environment) but you still prompt and handle the data flow in and out. See Claude Agent SDK, n8n.\n3. The 'agent' is actually a service. You give it a task, it returns the result. See Sierra, Jack&Jill.\n\nSo I think you should specify whether you mean (1), (2) or (3) when you say 'agentic AI'.\n\nTo give you an answer without that context (or the context of what isn't working on 'real workflows'), having built (1) and used a few of the SDKs, though:\n\nObservability.\n\nYou need to see:\n- what context is going in to the agent at each turn, and\n- what is it responding with?\n\nAfter that, ease of evaluation.\n\nHappy to help further if you provide more detail.",

If we can't easily build and maintain custom connectors, the tool will remain siloed and its utility will be severely limited.\n\n\n\n2.  \\*\\*Configurable Error Handling & Human-in-the-Loop Escalation:\\*\\* What happens when the agent gets stuck? A silent failure is unacceptable. We need granular control over the fallback process. Can it automatically create a detailed ticket in our issue tracker (e.g., Jira)? Can it pause the workflow and notify a specific team via Slack/Teams with the full context? An agent that can't gracefully ask for help is more of a liability than an asset.\n\n\n\nFeatures are easy to demo, but resilience and deep integration are what make an agent viable in a complex B2B environment.",

From a QA perspective, reliability matters more than novelty (I’d rather use something boring that runs consistently than something flashy that needs constant tweaking)\n\nWe’ve tested a few different approaches, including tools like askui that focus on interacting with the UI more like a human would instead of relying purely on selectors.

Not really out of curiosity, but from trying a few tools, building small workflows, and realizing how much time went into maintenance.\n\n**How I got here**\n\nFor me it started with Make. It can do a lot and it has many integrations, similar to Zapier in that sense. Over time though, it became noisy. Too many steps, too many things to watch. I was fixing workflows more than actually using them.\n\nLater I tried Gumloop, and that felt lighter and easier to get into. I didn’t need to plan everything upfront just to make simple things work. After jumping between tools for a while, I stopped comparing them one by one and looked at a comparison table instead. Seeing different automation tools side by side, with features and limits in one place, made the differences clearer.\n\n**n8n vs Zapier - how they feel in practice**\n\nWhen people talk about n8n vs Zapier, it often turns into a technical discussion. For me, it feels more like a working style question.\n\n**Zapier**\n\nWhat works well:\n\n* Feels steady and predictable\n* Easy to start with\n* You set it up and move on\n* Usually very reliable\n\nTrade-offs\n\n* As workflows grow, limits become noticeable\n* Pricing scales quickly\n* Flexibility drops over time\n\n**n8n**\n\nWhat works well:\n\n* Much closer to the workflow itself\n* More control\n* More room to customize logic\n\nTrade-offs\n\n* Requires more involvement\n* Setup and maintenance are part of the deal\n* Fixing things is expected when something changes\n\n**Final take**\n\nI don’t think there’s a final answer here. After trying different tools and comparing them side by side, it became clear that both have their pros and cons. The right choice depends on how much simplicity or control you need at a given point.  \n  \nDo you stick with one tool, or keep adjusting as things change?",

      "text": "I’ve been following a lot of the discussions here around AI agents vs traditional automation, and honestly most of the tension makes sense.  \n  \nOn one end you’ve got tools like n8n and Make. Super powerful, but you’re still responsible for wiring every branch, retry, and weird edge case by hand. On the other end, you have fully autonomous agents that look great in demos, but are hard to really trust once you put them into real workflows.  \n  \nWe kept running into the same problem while building and talking to users. People wanted agents that could actually run a process over time, not just respond once, but they didn’t want to maintain a full custom framework just to keep things from breaking.  \n  \nThat’s what led us to build MuleRun.  \n  \nThe idea was pretty simple. Instead of hardcoding everything or handing control to a total black box, you build agents by combining Claude-powered skills into clear workflows. You describe what the agent should do, how it moves between steps, and where it should stop, retry, or fail. The focus is reliability and reuse, not magic.  \n  \nA few things that might be relevant for users here:  \n  \n\\-Agents run in the cloud and follow explicit workflows  \n\\-Skills are reusable building blocks, not one-off prompts  \n\\-Agents can be published and reused by others  \n\\-During the beta, builders get $100 in credits to test real workloads  \n  \nWe’re also rewarding $100 cash for standout published agents  \n  \nWe’re currently running a beta and mostly looking for people who already think a lot about automation logic, failure modes, and real-world usage. Not trying to redefine terms or push hype, just sharing what we built after hitting the same walls again and again.  \n  \nCurious how others here think about the gap between classic automation and more autonomous agents, and whether this kind of middle-ground approach actually feels useful or not.  \n  \nHappy to answer questions or hear where you think this breaks down.",

      "text": "Clawdbot is genuinely impressive. Message it from WhatsApp or Telegram and it runs terminal commands, manages files, automates your browser. It remembers conversations for weeks. It messages you first with briefings and reminders. One guy negotiated $4,200 off a car through it. Another rebuilt his website via Telegram while watching Netflix.\n\n30,000+ GitHub stars. Mac Mini sales through the roof. People calling it “Jarvis that already exists.”\n\nLet’s break it down:\n\nBy default, it uses cloud models - your files, code, and private data potentially flowing through external servers. The “local-first” label is a bit misleading when inference still happens in the cloud.\n\nWant mobile access? You’ll need SSH tunnels, Tailscale, or VPNs. SSH can’t be established reliably if your home IP isn’t static without some middleman service. Tailscale encrypts the connection - but once your messages hit Telegram or WhatsApp servers and get decrypted on their end, you’re trusting them with every command, every file, every piece of context you share with your AI.\n\nThen there’s prompt injection. A malicious email, webpage, or document could theoretically instruct your AI to exfiltrate data or execute commands you never intended. One user nailed it: “Don’t give it access to anything you wouldn’t give a new contractor on day one.”\n\nNo directory sandboxing by default. Full system access out of the box.\n\nCool tool? Absolutely. Powerful? No question.\n\nBut is “local-first” the same as truly private? Is running locally enough when your data still touches third-party servers? And when one bad prompt can compromise your entire system - is the convenience worth the risk?\n\nWorth thinking about before you hand over the keys.",

Broken locators, environment data, timing flake, app changes, and truly valid bugs. You will usually find a small set of root causes creates most of the red. Fixing those gives you leverage. Then identify the 50 to 200 tests that cover the highest value paths and make those stable first. Everything else becomes backlog until proven useful.\n\nAlso, set expectations with your manager early. “Healthy” needs a definition, like X percent pass rate on a smoke suite that gates releases, not perfection across 2000 scripts.

The result was silent failures, missing records and teammates losing trust in automation altogether. What actually fixed it was treating workflows like real systems: using error outputs where supported, adding simple success checks on critical nodes like databases, validating AI responses before chaining them and adding basic monitoring so I know when something breaks instead of hearing it from a user. Once I rebuilt with those principles, the same workflow ran for weeks without surprises and became boring in the best way possible.

The key is treating workflows as robust systems, just like you did, ensuring each node’s behavior is well-understood, incorporating proper error handling, and validating data before moving forward. Simple checks and monitoring can make a huge difference in preventing those silent failures. Having a safety net in place, like setting up alerts or failure logging, can also help catch issues early. It's all about building for resilience so the automation doesn’t just work, it works reliably. Your experience will definitely help others avoid the same pitfalls!",
