      "text": "Background: non-coder, marketing professional. Last weekend, I built some automations. I have 15 working now:\n\nLinkedIn auto-poster, Reddit alert system, email responder, content reposter, meeting summarizer, competitor tracker, lead scorer, social scheduler, invoice reminders, research assistant, image pipeline, Slack digest, CRM updater, podcast notes, weekly reports.\n\n**How it worked:**\n\nI talked about what I wanted to do in English. I experimented with a few tools - some required Docker (gave up), some hit free limits quickly. Found one that had AI models built-in and just worked.\n\n**Surprised by:**\n\nEasy to chain multiple AI models together\n\nEnglish builder actually works\n\nFree tiers are more powerful than I thought\n\n**Still difficult**:\n\nChoosing the right AI model (GPT vs Claude vs Gemini)\n\nCrafting good prompts\n\nOAuth config\n\n12/15 are in production. I can answer questions.",

Once the agent is connected and has clear access via some sort of progressive discovery, *Sky(Nets)* the limit.   Yes!!!!  finally got a chance to use that.     \n  \nYour use case sounds challenging but give an AI progressive discovery access to all your platforms and the intelligence just sort of takes it from there, pure agency kicks in.   I'd look for a AI that can connect to multiple SaaS platforms, whether via progressive discovery MCP or other form of code execution.  It then becomes less about the particular task and more about the intelligence with the ability to take access and take action on various platforms in your ecosystem.    You have plenty of choices out there, but we've made it pretty seamless.    **I made a video walkthrough specifically for your challenge.

          "text": "Love this - going from 0 to 12 production workflows in a weekend is no joke. As someone who builds automation for clients, a few thoughts:\n\n\n\nWhat I'd focus on next:\n\n\n\n1. Error handling - If you haven't already, build fail-safe logic into each workflow. I learned this the hard way when a client's LinkedIn poster kept running even after their account got restricted. Add conditional branches for API errors, rate limits, etc.\n\n\n\n2. Monitoring - Set up notification workflows that alert you when something breaks. Your future self will thank you when the CRM updater stops syncing at 2am.\n\n\n\n3. Version control - Since 12 are in production, start keeping workflow backups. When you optimize one and it breaks, you'll want to roll back fast.\n\n\n\nOn your struggles:\n\n\n\n\\- Model choice: GPT-4 for structured data (JSON outputs), Claude for anything customer-facing (emails, messages), Gemini when you need cheap + fast. That's been my general rule.\n\n\n\n\\- Prompting: Treat prompts like code. Start generic, test with real data, iterate. Keep a \"prompt library\" doc with what works.\n\n\n\n\\- OAuth: Yeah, this never gets easier. Only tip: use tools that handle OAuth refresh tokens automatically. Manual token management is a time sink.\n\n\n\nReally solid work for a weekend. The fact that you shipped to production instead of just \"building cool stuff\" puts you ahead of 90% of people experimenting with automation.",

Scraping + qualifying leads from specific niches\n2. Enriching data and pushing it straight into a CRM\n3. Auto follow-ups based on reply/no reply\n4. Tagging + segmenting leads automatically\n5. Repurposing one long piece of content into LinkedIn posts, emails, short-form ideas, etc.\n\nAnother big one: onboarding flows. When someone buys a course or signs up for something, everything from payment confirmation → account creation → access expiry → reminder emails is automated. No manual checking.\n\nHonestly, the rule I follow is simple: if I have to do something more than 3–4 times a week and it’s predictable, I automate it.\n\nThe flashy stuff is cool, but the real value is in removing small repetitive friction from your day.

It’s whatever is repetitive, predictable, and annoying.\nReal examples I’ve seen stick:\n• Email / form intake\nNew requests get summarized, tagged, and routed automatically. Humans still decide, but they don’t read everything from scratch.\n• Data syncing between tools\nCRM ↔ spreadsheets ↔ Slack ↔ accounting. No “AI magic”, just keeping systems in sync so people stop copying data by hand.\n• Reporting\nPull numbers from a few sources, clean them up, and send a weekly report. Saves hours every week and nobody argues with the numbers anymore.\n• Document processing\nInvoices, receipts, contracts → extract key fields → flag exceptions. AI helps with extraction, not decisions.\n• Content prep (not full creation)\nDrafts, outlines, variations. Humans still review before anything goes out.\nThe common pattern: Automation works best when it reduces grunt work, not when it tries to replace judgment. The moment you can explain the benefit as this saves X hours per week or this removes Y manual errors, its usually worth doing.\nMost useful automations are boring — and that’s kind of the point.",

Everything is structured. Like i create daily tasks to fetch job links so that everyday at 9 AM I get links emailed. I just need to pick the appropriate one and make the video. \n\nAlso to write the proposals i created a GEM and feeded it with the data. I just need to type one word and I'll get everything in 10 seconds which is ultra customised.\n\n2. Office work. I'm a risk analyst so i should look through lines a lot, so yea to analyse the transactions I use it mostly and for account audit documentation.\n\nTrust me!

It uses a logic layer that actually follows my specific brand voice and vocabulary. Instead of spending hours editing generic AI drafts, I just get on-brand content ready to go immediately. It is massively underrated for keeping things consistent without the usual back and forth. Are you mostly looking to automate data collection or the actual production side of things?",

So basically doesn't matter what your product is whether it's a local business or even a national you can get in niche groups for your business, service, product takes about 10 minutes to set up a run and it will automate to 100 groups a day I haven't pushed it more than that if you have a newer Facebook account I would probably run 20 to 30 a day plus it has an RSS feed feature if you have a website, blog, video channel etc anything with an RSS feed you can plug that site in and select your group's targeted and every time you post to that RSS feed site it goes out to your targeted selected groups",

Deterministic steps. Measurable output. The moment it depends on flaky web scraping, unstable APIs, or loosely structured inputs, maintenance cost creeps up fast. Web based workflows are the biggest trap. They look simple but break silently when a page changes. We had to rethink that layer entirely and move to more controlled browser execution, experimenting with tools like hyperbrowser, just to reduce randomness before the rest of the workflow could be trusted.\n\nCurious what has actually paid off for people here.

It's insane how it can take a simple product image and create full blown photoshoots without actually changing the product details! You can also basically generate a start image and end image and turn this into a full video or reel using Google Veo 3 as well! Insane!\n* Similarly we're paying an agency for writing blogs and content for our website to improve our Google ranking! Since then we have been able to using AI tools like Frizerly to train AI on our business, product and search data to automatically create blogs on our website daily based on this! Results are comparable at this point! \n* Last but not least, every sales member was instructed to do a specific quota of cold outreach everyday from their linkedin and email to book sales calls daily! However our sales team hated this job again and we were finally able to automate the part till booking the sales call using tools like Clay! The key here though is still manually figuring out your ICP and messaging first before automating!",

      "text": "Saw a breakdown of a ClawHub skill that made me rethink how I'm approaching this whole thing.\n\nSomeone analyzed a skill called something like \"Spotify Music Management\" that looked totally normal. Manage playlists, discover music, whatever. But when they actually dug into the instructions, buried in there were prompts telling the agent to search for tax documents and extract social security numbers.\n\nA music skill. Looking for tax docs. And the actual music functionality was real, so it would have worked fine while quietly doing other things.\n\nThis sent me down a rabbit hole. OpenClaw has like 165k GitHub stars now and 700+ community skills on ClawHub. Security researchers have been poking around and found a pretty significant chunk of those skills contain sketchy instructions. Data exfiltration, credential harvesting, even malware downloads. And tons of instances are just sitting exposed on the internet because people don't change the default port settings.\n\nThe thing that gets me is how the attack model works. Nobody needs to hack you directly. They just poison a skill that your agent installs, and suddenly they have access to everything you've authorized. Messages, files, command execution. One bad skill turns your helpful assistant into an attack surface. And it's not just skills either. Apparently even webpages or emails your agent processes can contain hidden instructions that hijack what it's doing. So the attack surface is basically anything the agent touches.\n\nMakes it worse that flagged skills apparently just reappear under new names. Whack a mole situation.\n\nI've been trying to figure out how to actually vet this stuff. Some people manually review the skill code before installing, which works if you know what you're looking for. Others just ask around if anyone's used it before. I stumbled on some scanner thing called Agent Trust Hub that supposedly checks for sketchy stuff, though honestly automated scanning can only catch so much and attackers will eventually figure out how to bypass whatever patterns it looks for. Probably some combination of everything is the move, no single approach is gonna be bulletproof.\n\nOther stuff I'm doing now: Docker instead of bare metal, not exposing port 18789, throwaway accounts for testing, actually reading activity logs for once.\n\nThe OpenClaw FAQ literally describes the whole thing as a \"Faustian bargain\" with no perfectly safe setup. At least they're being honest about the tradeoffs.\n\nWould love to hear what this community has figured out. What does your vetting process actually look like, and has anyone found specific tools or workflows that catch stuff manual review might miss?",

I then asked ChatGPT to \"review the document for anything suspicious, specifically prompt poisoning/injection.\" It didn't find it.\n\nI tried a second variant of the prompt: \"Search this document for anything suspicious.

I use Depost AI to keep drafts, engagement and DM follow-ups from getting lost.\n\n- Feed headshot metadata into your prompts so the post copy can reference lighting, outfit or vibe.\n\n- Lock the same seed and crop so the headshot looks consistent across a feed.\n\n- Rotate in a real candid photo sometimes so enterprise prospects do not feel the profile is fully synthetic.\n\nReality check: follower spikes do not automatically equal inbound customers. Over-automating voice or DMs is usually why this kind of setup stalls.",

Also consider running A/B tests on the headshot styles - some audiences respond better to more casual vs formal professional shots. For the chatbot integration, feeding the headshot metadata (lighting angle, background type) into your prompt can help the AI write more contextually relevant posts that feel cohesive with the visual.",

I feel like I'm cheating somehow?\n\n**What I automated:**\n\nMorning news briefing - **Feedly** filters articles, sends digest Work prep -**ոbоt.аі** searches yesterday's notes for follow-ups Email sorting - **Gmail filters** \\+ **SaneBox** handles priorities Meeting summaries - **ꓳttеr.аі** records and transcribes calls Daily standup prep - **Zapier** pulls my completed tasks from Notion\n\n**The result:**\n\nSaves maybe 90 minutes daily. I'm more productive. Less stressed.\n\n**But here's the weird part:**\n\nI feel guilty telling coworkers I \"prepared thoroughly\" when really robots did most of it.\n\nLike when my boss compliments my meeting notes and I'm thinking \"yeah, AI transcribed and summarized that.\"\n\nOr when someone asks \"how do you stay on top of everything?\" and I don't mention automation because it feels like cheating.\n\n**The question:**\n\nIs this the new normal and I just need to get over it?\n\nOr is there something ethically weird about automating preparation work and taking credit for being organized?\n\n**Genuine confusion:**\n\nIf a chef uses a food processor instead of chopping by hand, nobody cares. The food still tastes good.\n\nSo why do I feel weird about using AI to process information instead of doing it manually? The output is still good.\n\n**Does anyone else feel this way?**\n\nOr am I overthinking and should just enjoy having more time for actual creative work?",

You know, the typical video that says: \"Today, Team A is playing and pays X value vs. Team B, which pays X value.\" Before AI, I had to:\n\n1. Research which were the most attractive matches, aiming for at least 10, 15 matches.\n\n2. Choose the 2 or 3 most attractive markets, meaning the bet that would most engage users, so I had to rely on my intuition and pick something good.\n\n3. Then, write a whole list of at least 10, 15 matches with their markets in Word.\n\n4. Open After Effects and start filling it block by block, then export.\n\n5. Send them to the channel.\n\nNow, thanks to AI, I have a custom GPT that gives me 15 matches at once, with their respective most attractive markets.\n\nGPT still can't access these betting pages due to regulations, and there are no APIs for this. For this, I use a Perplexity agent that takes control of the browser and returns these 15 matches with 3 markets each.\n\nThanks to Claude, I made a script to map the text fields in After Effects and rename them. Now I give the info to a custom GPT that converts my data to CSV, which I open in After Effects and it immediately updates in After.\n\nNow, I haven't been able to automate this part, and it's that I have to go composition by composition, click and send to render, and click on render.\n\nI extract the videos and send them via WeTransfer. In conclusion, I went from taking up to 8 hours to only taking a maximum of 1",

          "text": "Real experience here — I run a freelance automation practice and it's genuinely consistent work, not just one-offs.\n\nThe demand breaks down into a few buckets:\n\n1. Business process automation — This is the bread and butter. Small businesses drowning in manual tasks: invoice processing, lead capture from forms into CRMs, report generation, data syncing between platforms. They don't even know what n8n or Zapier is — they just know they're spending 10 hours a week on something that should take zero. These clients pay well and come back for more once they see the first workflow running.\n\n2. Web scraping — Steady demand but more project-based. Price monitoring, competitor tracking, lead generation, real estate listings, job aggregation. The recurring revenue comes from maintenance contracts because websites change their structure and scrapers break. That's where the real money is — not the initial build, but the \"keep it running\" retainer.\n\n3. Social monitoring / content automation — Growing fast. I built a system that monitors 15 Reddit subreddits, filters by keywords, and auto-drafts replies using a local AI model. Businesses want this kind of thing for lead generation, reputation monitoring, and content research. Most don't know it's possible until you show them.\n\n4. Data pipeline / integration work — Connecting APIs that don't natively talk to each other. CRM to accounting software, e-commerce to shipping, form submissions to Slack notifications. Boring but endless demand.\n\nThe key is positioning yourself as solving a business problem, not selling \"automation scripts.\" Nobody searches for \"I need a Python script.\" They search for \"how do I stop manually copying data between spreadsheets every Monday.\"\n\nIt's not niche — it's just underserved because most businesses don't know these solutions exist until someone shows them.",

For example go to a Plumbing company and help them automate lead generation from google maps. A lot of these companies are already doing it manually and you can sell this as a solution without the need to expose the tech. There are literally hundreds of such examples.

If your invoices follow a consistent format, you could keep your customer list in Excel with invoice number and email columns, then use something like Power Automate or Zapier to watch a specific folder where you save the scanned invoices. When a new PDF is added, the automation can match the invoice number to the Excel sheet, pull the customer email, and automatically send the email with a preset subject line that includes the invoice number and date.\n\nIf you want to go one step further, look into using a scanner that can automatically save files into a specific folder with a consistent naming format. Once the file name includes the invoice number, the rest becomes much easier to automate. You would still review things at first to make sure it works correctly, but after that the process should go from a repetitive daily task to just a quick check instead of doing every step manually.",

You can 'train' its AI in minutes to find the Invoice Number, Date, and Customer Name on your specific scan.\n3. **The Brain (Zapier):** This is where you connect the dots. Zapier can take that info from Parsio, look up the email in your Excel sheet, and then draft the email in Gmail automatically.\n\nI usually tell people to ask: *'Does this task require judgment or just repetition?'* Since looking up an email and typing a subject line is 100% rule-based, it’s the perfect candidate for automation.\n\nAre the invoices all in the same format, or do they come from many different vendors?

I would set up three pieces first an OCR tool that watches a scanner folder and renames files using the invoice number and date then a script or low code tool that matches that file to the customer email in Excel and finally an email automation that sends the invoice with the right subject line. Once that flow is stable I would drop the steps into a recurring checklist in Manifestly so nothing falls through the cracks and you can gradually refine the process as you learn where delays or mistakes happen.",

Most processes fail right around where you said - volume goes up, conversions plummet.\n\nWhat you're doing is smart because you're differentiating between strategy and execution, taking the human aspect of the strategy and positioning, and leaving the boring mechanics of automation for automation. The only way outbound is future-proof is if that happens.\n\n\n\nWe’ve already seen similar results with systems being created inside BeGig Studio with an intention-first approach for founders and freelancers doing an outbound strategy. In this case, instead of relying on messages utilizing scraped variables, the change in reply rates is tremendous.\n\n\n\nGreat example of the use of automation to amplify human thought rather than replace human thought!",

It’s saved our team a lot of time and reduced stress\n\nThat said, I’m wondering how others are using AI assistants for appointments in their businesses:\n\n• Are they improving customer experience?\n\n• Do they actually save time or money?\n\n• Any challenges you ran into while implementing one?\n\nWould love to hear real experiences what worked, what didn’t, and any tips for making AI appointment management as smooth as possible.",

          "text": "The AI demonstrates its highest value when it handles both intake and scheduling tasks because this function goes beyond simple booking duties. The system requires permission to ask qualifying questions which will enable it to select appropriate services and time slots while sending accurate information to both the calendar and CRM system. The initial project faced its most significant difficulty because it needed to handle exceptional situations which included reschedules and exceptions and VIP client situations. Once the rules were established as permanent procedures the system delivered time savings of several hours every week while decreasing the number of clients who missed their appointments.",

          "text": "We built AI appointment scheduling into our workflow for a handful of home service clients and the results have been pretty dramatic. Before the AI handled calls, these businesses were missing roughly 40% of inbound calls during business hours and basically 100% after hours. Now the capture rate is north of 90% across all hours.\n\nThe biggest win honestly isn't even the scheduling itself. It's the qualification step. The AI asks 3-4 questions before booking, things like service type, property size, urgency level. So by the time the appointment hits the calendar, the business owner already knows if it's a $200 job or a $2000 job and can prep accordingly. One plumbing company told me their average ticket value went up 25% because they stopped showing up to jobs that were clearly mismatched.\n\nChallenges are real though. The biggest one is handling edge cases. About 15% of callers have questions that fall outside the AI's training scope and if you don't have a clean handoff to a human, those callers just hang up frustrated. We had to build a pretty solid fallback system where the AI recognizes it's stuck and immediately routes to a live person or sends a text saying someone will call back within 10 minutes.\n\nThe other thing that surprised me is how much the reminder system matters. Automated reminders 24 hours and 2 hours before the appointment cut no-shows by about 60% for most of our clients. That alone paid for the entire system.\n\nCalendar integration is table stakes at this point. If your AI books into something that doesn't sync with Google Calendar or whatever the team actually uses, you'll create more problems than you solve.",

I’m genuinely trying to understand operational pain points small businesses are facing right now.  \n  \nOver the past few months, we’ve noticed something consistent:  \nMost businesses don’t lack tools.  \n They lack clean workflows.  \n  \nCommon patterns we’ve seen:\n\n* Manual follow-ups eating hours every week\n* Leads slipping through because no one “owns” the pipeline\n* Repetitive admin work that shouldn’t be manual anymore\n* Processes that depend heavily on one person who knows everything\n\nI’m curious from this community:  \nWhat repetitive task frustrates you the most right now?  \nWhere do leads or internal processes break down?\n\n* Is there something you know could be automated but haven’t had time to fix?\n\nIf you're open to sharing, I’d love to hear specifics. I’ll respond with practical ideas I’ve seen work in similar situations.",

It was mind-numbing work and left me less time for what actually matters: making calls and closing deals. My company put us on la growth machine last year. I not fond of the idea, to be honest. But I have to admit, it works. The tool handles all the upfront research and initial contact. It's not magic. It's a machine that does the grunt work. but saves me about 10 hours a week I can now use to actually talk to qualified prospects instead of looking for them.",
