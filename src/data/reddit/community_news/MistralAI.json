You could still re-train the model a bit more when it comes to technical issues, but it is doing a great job.\n\n  \nThese other LLM models, except Claude maybe, lack what Mistral is bringing to the table in terms of sources trained on and system prompts taiming it. It's objective and not biased.\n\n  \nMistral, please prioritize making a Windows store app, MacOS app to get this ball rolling faster. It's easier to get my crowd going with these simple means and thereby spreading the good work you did. Ppl need convenience - you already deliver on quality.\n\n  \n",

      "text": "Spending most of my time on Claude’s Max 20x plan (Opus 4.5) and occasionally hitting my weekly limits, I decided to revisit **Mistral Vibe 2.0** and **Le Chat** after a long break. Here are my first impressions, especially compared to Opus 4.5 and Codex CLI.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Codex CLI (5.2), Underwhelming First Impressions**\n\nI tested Codex in a structured folder with lots of context (files, scripts, and dedicated system for specific workflows that are to be followed). On first prompts and even after instructing it to analyze the **folder context**, it struggled to understand or comply and generate based on an understanding of the surrounding context. It felt less like a true CLI tool and more like a system just inlining requests without grasping the environment. Big asterix: It's also my first time trying codex and I need to explore it more, but the first results were disappointing.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Mistral Vibe 2.0**\n\nReally great first impression, I was very pleasantly surprised!\n\nIt really stood out was how thoroughly Mistral Vibe 2.0 tried to understand the context first (even without being told to do so). It didn’t just jump into answering; it checked the surrounding files, analyzed available examples, and tried to understand what a good outcome would look like before starting to work.\n\nAnd I was blown away by how **fast** Mistral Vibe 2.0 is. The response generation is so quick that I can’t even read along as it outputs. This is a game-changer for feedback loops. While I of course believe that Claude Opus 4.5 is currently the king for coding and complex tasks, I’ll be testing Mistral Vibe 2.0 much more for coding and general tasks to see how it performs. For everyday structured tasks, Mistral’s first impression suggests it could be a **fantastic alternative and fallback system**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Le Chat App**\nThe Le Chat app has improved significantly since I last tried it:\n* Voice input is now a thing, and it’s seamless! (Claude struggles a lot with this) When I last used Le Chat, this feature didn’t even exist. I tested it with a long, multi-minute transcription, and the accuracy was impressive. I did a few feedback rounds, and Mistral applied my edits smoothly. I’m not sure how they made it *that* fast—**the turnaround times for voice transcription and immediate answers are incredibly impressive**.\n* Online research seemed also to work great  and possibly now on par with ChatGPT?\nI’m not even sure yet what other awesome features and UX additions there are, but I’m excited to explore further.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Potential Switch?**\nGiven Mistral’s speed, UX, and awesome voice transcription, etc, I’m seriously considering making Le Chat + Mistral Vibe 2.0 my daily driver for everyday tasks and as a fallback when Claude’s limits kick in (and Le Chat possibly always preferred because of the speed and the great voice transcription in multiple languages). I’ll test-drive it for a few days, and if it proves as powerful as I hope (writing this as a \"wow, just tried this\" post, so maybe lots of honey moon phase involved), I might cancel my ChatGPT subscription and make Le Chat my main driver for everyday use.\n\nI’m all for EU digital sovereignty, so supporting Mistral feels like a win-win and I am incredibly happy & excited about all the progress being made.\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n* **First rough impressions**: Just excited to share my initial enthusiasm for Mistral Vibe 2.0 and Le Chat after revisiting them.\n* **Codex CLI** felt underwhelming as a CLI tool, especially with folder context. Not sure about code quality and similar yet (also very first impression).\n* **Mistral Vibe 2.0** impressed with speed and context handling; I’ll test it more for coding.\n* **Le Chat app** now includes voice input and shines with great transcription quality, incredible speed (game changer for back and forth loops), and online research\n* While **Opus 4.5 likely remains unmatched for coding**, Mistral’s first impression suggests it could be a **fantastic alternative and fallback system** for everyday tasks.\n\n\nBig thank you to the Mistral team for all the hard work! Rooting for you big time ♥️🇪🇺!",

          "text": "Collecting new findings here as I continue testing: \n\n* I am not super happy with it being pretty hard to copy from the CLI progress. Often I need to \"reply\" to something the agents do and the UX loops around that are crucial. It's pretty bad at the moment, the UI needs a long time to react and seems to include some automatic \"copied!\" feature, that appears very late multiple times and that I don't really care about. Easy direct select -> right click -> copy would be best and should be fast and fluid. That's a \"small\" thing that makes a **huge** difference. \n* Scrolling can also be pretty sluggish (very very late start and keys like 'end' also have many seconds of delay). Possibly tracked here: https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe/issues/222\n* There must be a specific system in place for interruptions? The agent reacted much faster than Claude Code Opus to a \"no\" during generation. Basically almost immediate stop\n* CLI text input seems a bit sluggish when much is happening\n* Context usage seems to go up fairly slowly. Not sure if that's a good or bad thing (testing it for some coding right now).\n* Every response / input during generation seems to be treated as an interruption (so no \"next task queuing\" like with Claude Code). Maybe there is a way to queue?",

Especially in the last weeks instruction following was pretty much non-existent for the few tests I did and I have been avoiding it ever since. \nBut I also mostly used the web interface so far, so maybe it's a different story with the CLI. \n\nI would have very much recommended Claude Code with Opus 4.5 and used to be *insane* around release / December, but has deteriorated massively in terms of quality the last few weeks. Possibly due to a switch from Google GPUs to the ones they developed with AWS, but not sure.  \nStill, it is very much worth a try if you go for the 5x or 20x max plans (they are very worth it). API pricing would be incredibly expensive (easy to burn through 20-80 bucks an hour). \n\nRegarding your questions: \nYes, API key pay as you go exists and I think the subscription now also included some vague notion of \"full day coding\"? \n\nPicture generate would likely mean an additional model, but that should be easy to integrate into your workflow (e.g. continue using Gemini's very powerful nano-banana-pro or flux).\n\nGreat to hear that you care about European tools!",

It didn't realize that, so it added more and more characters to the pattern until it was huge -- without ever thinking \"is this overkill? That looks weirdly huge\" even though the purpose of the code was just to make sure a line starts with the word \"AGENT:\".\n\nThis is something that could have been autonomously fixed with an orchestrator that includes failure analysis, sees the blind spot, and proposes an alternate approach before launching another attempt. A reasoning model might also have a much easier time course-correcting.\n\nI was using the CLI by itself so I just said \"try to simplify the regular expression by writing it from scratch, and if it still fails, just write a parser\" -- it failed fast and wrote a parser, then got back to work.",

          "text": "Well, its slow to run locally and while decent at coding its less flexible, mostly from the lack of ability to turn on high thinking. It's a nice model and it's got it's niche but glm 4.7 is usually better and more flexible even quantised to a similar size as devstral. It is a useful thing and I'm trying to use it more if only to support a european company but I think it kind of misses the benefit of being the only big dense model that will fit on a local 128GB machine (i.e. being smarter than anything comparable in size) due to said lack of thinking. For a really really smart model I could run locally I would be willing to wait but because it doesn't think it is not actually smarter than a q2 quantised glm 4.7 that also fits on my machine and it's slower.\n\nThats my take at the moment, I'm trying to explore it more, see if I can get more out of it.\n\nEdit: So... Fun fact! You can actually make devstral 2 123B reason! Accidently had a reasoning forcing jinja template on for another model when I started testing the mlx version of this thing with a couple of reasoning effot = extra high statements in my system prompt because I really wanted more reasoning out of the last model I was using and havving forgotten about that tried devstral 2 and got 2 minutes of reasoning before it answered my test question.\n\nI shall be doing a great deal of further testing.\n\nEdit 2 Devstral 24B also reasons if you set it to do so in the jinja.\n\nTurns out they are both hybrid reasoners if you put {%- set reasoning\\_content = 'High' %} in the jinja. Nice clean logical reasoning as well. That's actually fixed my main issue with these models, sometimes you just really need that extra consistency.",

Anecdotally, Devstral Small 2 repeatedly beats GPT-OSS-120B on my codebases despite being so far apart on benchmarks.\n\nGLM 4.7 Flash on the other hand is also excellent and kicks the 120B on the same stuff I'm working (ML, financial algos, Rust, NextJS, etc), but Devstral Small 2 has more eye to detail where GLM left some issues I had \"as is\".\n\nHowever, GLM 4.7 Flash is broadly smarter and more update to date on greater schemes compared to Devstral but has less knack on repo work. Like them both, but I lean towards Devstral over the fact it has more enterprise grade efficiency. Could be bias, but I like minimalistic response, and it can be extensively detailed when require (docs, blueprints >1k lines).\n\nAnother important note that resonates with my experience, the GPT-OSS models have large response variance where Devstral is more deterministic and is consistent on every round, and this reflected on SWE-Rebench charts from Ibragim.\n\nI find this variance inconvenient for coding despite tighter sampling as repeated, personal tests yielded different results.\n\nI haven't used GLM 4.7 Flash long enough to detect that but generally the apple doesn't fall far from tree if it follows the grand 4.7.",

I don't have beefy enough hardware locally to run it at a reasonable speed and last I checked the only cloud inference providers offering the devstral-2 models will train on your data (Mistral included for their consumer offerings).  On OpenRouter you get Mistral or Chutes, that's it.\n\nI'm hoping some cloud inference providers will pick up devstral-2 (and devstral-small-2) after tomorrow once Mistral starts charging for the API access.

That was mostly as an API user.\n\n  \nThis time I ran most of the big consumer-facing LLMs against each other in a 'Deep Research' style task. The focus was competitor news.\n\nMistral didn't win. But I think did commendably well. Especially given:\n\n\\- (a) relative underdog status compared to other players on this list,\n\n\\- (b) I using the very fast free tier (unlike Claude's slow, very expensive tier), and\n\n\\- (c) it was \\*clearly\\* better than Perplexity and Gemini.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bcbnmklhmrfg1.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9f06a7c5f9a38234ca58faf6a9e9b1758a3d30d\n\n\n\nYou can see more about the test here: [https://anatole.fyi/blog/competitive-intelligence-face-off](https://anatole.fyi/blog/competitive-intelligence-face-off)\n\n\n\nAnd yes, you'll see it's flawed. I only did one run per LLM. The prompt was bad. Obviously on another attempt or with a better prompt Gemini won't have quite such a meltdown. But, when I'm using these tools day to day I would rather not have to run them multiple times or craft my prompt. And I think this side-by-side beats pure anecdote when comparing LLM quality.\n\n  \nWill run another test soon. Let me know what you think.\n\n",

Let me clarify: I'm not a developer. I use AI to search for information, help with solo role-playing games (RPG), and research Warhammer 40k lore and similar topics. With Claude, I feel like I'm in heaven, but I understand that more and more (especially in recent days), it would be better to distance myself from US services. For some time now, I've been trying to use Le Chat, but every time it seems to be lagging behind. It's as if it doesn't consider the nuances in what I say, doesn't analyze in depth, always stops at the first point, and doesn't go into detail thoroughly. Am I doing something wrong? Should I create specific agents? Should I give it more precise and less discursive instructions? I tend to create queries as if I were talking to a person, and this works well with Claude, but maybe not here? I need some feedback from those who use it as their main AI.",

You could try some of the Chinese open weight models and have them hosted in some jurisdiction of your choice.\n\nBtw, you can get an unbiased overview of where the Mistral models stand:  \n[https://lmarena.ai/de/leaderboard/text](https://lmarena.ai/de/leaderboard/text)\n\nOn this site, you can start chatting and you'll receive two responses from two different models, but you don't know which is which.  \nThen you pick which response you like the best (and then it will be revealed which model you had been talking too).\n\nThis is great to get a feel for all kinds of different models you may not had on your radar. And it also shows a realistic ranking (from other people) that are not based on benchmarks (which can be gamed).\n\nYou find the Mistral models on that list way down on position 40+.",

It just aligns so well with what I’m looking for, simply perfect.\n\n**Now, the bad**:\n\nAfter a dozen responses, it starts looping. It repeats the same structure obsessively. The opener is usually a stage direction / third-person style comment followed by em-dash. The closing comment is something cheesy between parenthesis. Markdown formatting is injected everywhere even if forbidden in the sys prompt.\n\nHas anyone had any success in using this model in the context of a chat/companion app? System prompt, temperature, mid-chat steering... Nothing has been working so far.\n\nI have tried plenty of other models, but none comes close to the tone and voice Ministral offers. So, I’m on a hunt to understand if there’s anything that can tame this obsessive looping and poor instruction-following.",
