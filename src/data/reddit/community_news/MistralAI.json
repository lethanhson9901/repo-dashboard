      "text": "I’m sharing my thoughts and an initiative here—I hope it doesn’t come across as spam, but I’d love to spark a discussion.\n\nI often hear that Europe is hopelessly behind in AI (and not just in AI, by the way). While it’s undeniable that there’s a gap, Mistral’s Devstral 2 model scores 72.2 on SWE-Bench verified, matching the performance of Claude Opus 4, which was released 7 months earlier.\n\nWe could argue that Mistral is only 7 months behind, despite:\n\n* Budgets **tens of times smaller**. **Mistral has raised about $3B, while OpenAI has $58B, Anthropic $37B,** Meta plans to spend $115B in 2026 alone, and xAI secured $5B just as seed funding.\n* No access to massive data centers and higher European energy costs.\n* Limited data compared to Google and others.\n\nSeven months is nothing, and coding performance is one of the best predictors of future success.\n\nAssuming the main issue is capital, how can we attract it? I’ve thought about this and believe this proposal is feasible:\n\n* Create a large government fund, similar to Norway’s pension fund, with **voluntary participation from European and non-European countries**.\n* With a modest investment (<0.5% of GDP), **we could unlock €100-300B**—a huge sum compared to current European investments.\n* The fund would invest in local innovative AI companies, support a CERN for AI, build data centers (e.g., in Norway or Canada, where energy is cheap), and fund future technologies like robotics.\n* By leveraging private investments, which would surely follow, we could reach even higher figures.\n\nWhat do you think? I’m interested in your opinions.\n\nIn my view, the benefits would be enormous:\n\n* Competitive European AI on par with the US and China.\n* Partial public control over a technology that could become dangerous.\n* Wealth creation here.\n\nAll this at a manageable initial cost, shared among many countries, and likely to pay off in the coming years with potentially massive returns.\n\nMini-spam: Since talking is good but action is better, some friends and I have created [a petition](http://openpetition.eu/!swjml) and [a website](https://ai-movement.org/) to push this project forward. If you’re interested, I’d be thrilled, but either way, I hope this sparks a meaningful discussion.\n\n[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1qs3bbw)",

They hold all the capital and have very low tolerance to risk and too long term cycles. Things have been slowly improving for the last 10 years but it's not even remotely at the pace everyone else is.\nIf you feel tech hubs like Berlin, Paris, Amsterdam they have very little to envy to others except for access to VCs.\n\nI don't want to be negative with your initiative but it's very highly unlikely that a sovereign fund or crowd capital is going to make any difference at scale (it can still get results but things don't snowball here), they move too slow and the tolerance for risk is too low.\n\nThat being said, Mistral IS competitive in the AI landscape, and IS spearheading it. Their tech is amazing across the board and they have key advantages that others cannot reach. There are other entities (that I can't name without doxxing myself too much) in the EU that are rock solid as well. \n\nSo I wouldn't talk in terms of hypotheticals. \n\nI would say let's keep running, we can already breath on their necks (otherwise we wouldn't see so much FUD spreading posts in here).",

And unless we want them to go balls to the wall on cost savings and replace white collar workers (and blue collar workers when the AI finally have physical bodies) then we should try to find alternative use-cases as examples.\n\nWe can let agents handle simple and tedious tasks and probably save some manhours but those junior tasks are what builds up the next generation of workers so…\n\nAnyway the genie is out of the bottle so we can only adapt and run as fast as we can.

      "text": "People often talk about chatbots only for niche or irrelevant everyday applications. I think Le Chat is one of the best tools for leveraging a virtual assistant, especially when using agents specialized in specific tasks.\n\nI’ve created dozens of agents that have replaced many of the apps I used before. For example\n\n* I have one that searches Wikipedia to ensure answers are accurate. I provide context to Le Chat, and it does the work autonomously.\n* Another agent updates me on daily news by searching the web directly.\n* An agent that acts as an organizer: it creates to-do lists where I can add or mark tasks as completed. I even add photos, handwritten notes, maps etc..\n* Another agent serves as a translator from Italian (my language) but unlike Google Translate, it maintains the conversation context. I can write a sentence in Italian, and it translates it into English without adding introductory or concluding phrases. Plus, I can ask it to rephrase the sentence in a more formal or informal tone, leveraging the capabilities of an advanced language model.\n* Another agent I developed manages my diet. I uploaded the meal plan provided by my nutritionist (I used Mistral’s Document AI to extract data from the PDF, which worked perfectly), and the agent generates meals that respect the specified calories and nutritional composition.\n* Finally, I use agents for gaming too. I play *Caves of Qud*, a roguelike where the story is procedurally generated and dialogue and descriptions are key to the fun. Since the game is in English and contains complex terms, I use a specially configured agent to:\n   * translate screenshots\n   * keep track of the game’s lore\n   * write a progress diary to remember what I’ve done\n   * memorize the characters I’ve met (the game is vast and changes with every playthrough).\n\nOpening a chat with a preconfigured agent is much faster and simpler than launching an app. IMHO for these quick, everyday tasks, Mistral is a step ahead of the competition.",

I think this makes it ideal for defense and companies that need to keep secrets (ASML is a big investor, I guess no wonder?).\n\nI fear this leaves no compute room for, and less incentive to, produce great large competitive models for le chat, which I guess does not provide any revenue and might cost money…\n\nBut I still hope I am wrong, and they pivot to make a great le chat model that is competitive!! 🤷‍♂️ \nI do think their latest (non-thinking) option in le chat is pretty decent in understanding?

We simply do not have tech companies in Europe that can invest hundreds of billions in AI the way US giants can.\n\nOn top of that, Europe has far less venture capital, especially for extremely risky deep tech bets like frontier AI.\n\nA big part of the problem is that Europe still lacks a real single capital market. We are effectively a collection of national markets instead of one integrated one, which makes it much harder to build companies of US size and power.\n\nAnd this is also the main reason our successful tech startups move to Silicon Valley.\n\nIt is overwhelmingly about access to capital, not bureaucracy. The US simply has deeper, faster, and more risk-tolerant funding, plus one unified capital market. Europe’s fragmented markets make it far harder to scale companies to that level, no matter how good the founders or technology are.",

I've been using Le Chat Pro heavily and I haven't had any issues with hitting limits, the same with the API (I am using Mistral Vibe for several projects, Document OCR and Mistral Large 3). For roughly 20 euros per month you get access to a lot of models and possibilities to experiment without going bankrupt.\n\n- Document OCR is really, really good. I was surprised how well it extracts text not following a specific format, identifies tables, forms, images and it does all that super fast. Like, I extracted all content from 3-4 PDFs that were overall around 600 pages in maybe 3-4 minutes. \n\n- Mistral Vibe and Codestral. Super fast and you can really do your job with them. I've added Codestral for autocomplete in my IDE and I love it. I know some people will complain that you can't do things with Vibe like prompting it \"make me a complete web app that does X\" and compare it to something like Claude Code where it can go on for days and build the whole damn thing without you having to touch a line of code; I think both are tools that can be very useful if you know when to use them. I see Mistral Vibe as a solution when you have a good idea of how you want to implement something and you can provide fairly detailed instructions, like \"implement a class having this structure and including the following methods accepting the following parameters\". In such cases it does a good job and also, in being so fast, I noticed I really like the feedback cycle in which I provide instructions, Mistral executes, I have a look at what it's done and run the code and check that it works as expected. \n\n- The language models are not as limited by the thought police and don't freak out if you mention something \"sensitive\". I discovered Gemini deleted entire conversations because it deemed some topics were \"not acceptable\", meanwhile almost everything flies with Mistral as long as it is not something straight out illegal or at least very questionable.\n\nAlso, as a final word, I really appreciate Mistral's initiative to try and find niches in which it performs really well instead of trying to compete head on with the big players. It also seems like it tries to grow in a sustainable way, which I think will be important in the future once the AI bubble starts to show signs of cracking.",

Fast because small. And looking at the burn rates of AI companies it is more likely to remain close to this price point in the future, because it appears to be more sustainable. As a developer that makes me trust investment in Mistral models more. Nothing worse than building your tools on top of a huge model, and then being confronted by a ten times price hike or the models dumbing down arbitrarily to cut spending.\n\n\\- A more European style of communication and more focus on Europe. TBF in my experience you should avoid topics like US politics though. It's not good at that, and easily hallucinates.\n\n\\- Complies with the privacy-by-design principles of the GDPR. That makes it a good B2B offering in Europe. Trying to bring OpenAI, Anthropic, or xAI in is hopeless.

I have had a single Chat with Grok in Norwegian, and I did recognize similar issues there as well. Other models for local use also suffers, like Llama.\n\nNorwegian is a language in decline, everyone learns English long before we start producing media, which means that we engage in English at a very early age, even when generating media etc.\n\nThis leads to a drought in modern datasets in the language, which makes LLMs rely on older content (Ibsen etc). That is rather arcane, thus, the responses will be similarly arcane.\n\nTLDR; Norwegian is dying, content made in modern Norwegian is rare and sparse, so LLMs rely on a time when it wasn't, so back to the 70s or so we go.",
