It's a nice model and it's got it's niche but glm 4.7 is usually better and more flexible even quantised to a similar size as devstral. It is a useful thing and I'm trying to use it more if only to support a european company but I think it kind of misses the benefit of being the only big dense model that will fit on a local 128GB machine (i.e. being smarter than anything comparable in size) due to said lack of thinking. For a really really smart model I could run locally I would be willing to wait but because it doesn't think it is not actually smarter than a q2 quantised glm 4.7 that also fits on my machine and it's slower. \n\nThats my take at the moment, I'm trying to explore it more, see if I can get more out of it.",

Anecdotally, Devstral Small 2 repeatedly beats GPT-OSS-120B on my codebases despite being so far apart on benchmarks.\n\nGLM 4.7 Flash on the other hand is also excellent and kicks the 120B on the same stuff I'm working (ML, financial algos, Rust, NextJS, etc), but Devstral Small 2 has more eye to detail where GLM left some issues I had \"as is\".\n\nHowever, GLM 4.7 Flash is broadly smarter and more update to date on greater schemes compared to Devstral but has less knack on repo work. Like them both, but I lean towards Devstral over the fact it has more enterprise grade efficiency. Could be bias, but I like minimalistic response, and it can be extensively detailed when require (docs, blueprints >1k lines).\n\nAnother important note that resonates with my experience, the GPT-OSS models have large response variance where Devstral is more deterministic and is consistent on every round, and this reflected on SWE-Rebench charts from Ibragim.\n\nI find this variance inconvenient for coding despite tighter sampling as repeated, personal tests yielded different results.\n\nI haven't used GLM 4.7 Flash long enough to detect that but generally the apple doesn't fall far from tree if it follows the grand 4.7.",

The 123B really wants reasoning to be the best possible answer I can get for 128GB memory option.",

The minimax ones are worse though, not quite sure why but different models seem to take better or worse to dynamic quants and glm is the best ive seen. Anyway.\n\n\nNo i havent tried vibe with it. Tried it in claude code but I'll give vibe a go. Makes sense it would be optimised for its own harness.\n\n\nWont be fast though at least not the big one unless i go api, i get about 5 token/second with devstral 123 vs 60 with gpt oss 120 or 20 ish with glm. As i said, worth it if its good enough but it has to be consistent enough to not want to retry things a lot. Will give it a go in vibe.\n\n\nEdit.

On OpenRouter you get Mistral or Chutes, that's it.\n\nI'm hoping some cloud inference providers will pick up devstral-2 (and devstral-small-2) after tomorrow once Mistral starts charging for the API access.

I think it can handle a lot of the implementation but the competition is just easier to work with it seems.\n\nAt the same time I am happy to see Mistral Vibe BUT the documentation is either very limited or very hard to find. I came to the conclusion it is incomplete. I may be wrong. For example, I know Vibe supports skills because I saw the release notes but try finding the documentation on it.\n\nIn general I  do not think it reasonable to expect people to beta test a product (Vibe) that is lagging behind on the competition so much.\n\nWhat would keep me trying Vibe and Devstral is being able to use it free, daily or weekly limits are reasonable to impose, until it has caught up more to the competition.\n\nSo please consider making the Devstral models (limited) free on Mistral Vibe.  \n(I do not know what is technically possible given the trouble Claude Code is having limiting the subscription model to Claude Code only but a clear TOS from the help may help.)\n\nThis way I could keep on using (and testing) both.",

But I think did commendably well. Especially given:\n\n\\- (a) relative underdog status compared to other players on this list,\n\n\\- (b) I using the very fast free tier (unlike Claude's slow, very expensive tier), and\n\n\\- (c) it was \\*clearly\\* better than Perplexity and Gemini.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bcbnmklhmrfg1.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9f06a7c5f9a38234ca58faf6a9e9b1758a3d30d\n\n\n\nYou can see more about the test here: [https://anatole.fyi/blog/competitive-intelligence-face-off](https://anatole.fyi/blog/competitive-intelligence-face-off)\n\n\n\nAnd yes, you'll see it's flawed. I only did one run per LLM. The prompt was bad. Obviously on another attempt or with a better prompt Gemini won't have quite such a meltdown. But, when I'm using these tools day to day I would rather not have to run them multiple times or craft my prompt. And I think this side-by-side beats pure anecdote when comparing LLM quality.\n\n  \nWill run another test soon. Let me know what you think.\n\n",

Let me clarify: I'm not a developer. I use AI to search for information, help with solo role-playing games (RPG), and research Warhammer 40k lore and similar topics. With Claude, I feel like I'm in heaven, but I understand that more and more (especially in recent days), it would be better to distance myself from US services. For some time now, I've been trying to use Le Chat, but every time it seems to be lagging behind. It's as if it doesn't consider the nuances in what I say, doesn't analyze in depth, always stops at the first point, and doesn't go into detail thoroughly. Am I doing something wrong? Should I create specific agents? Should I give it more precise and less discursive instructions? I tend to create queries as if I were talking to a person, and this works well with Claude, but maybe not here? I need some feedback from those who use it as their main AI.",

The opener is usually a stage direction / third-person style comment followed by em-dash. The closing comment is something cheesy between parenthesis. Markdown formatting is injected everywhere even if forbidden in the sys prompt.\n\nHas anyone had any success in using this model in the context of a chat/companion app? System prompt, temperature, mid-chat steering... Nothing has been working so far.\n\nI have tried plenty of other models, but none comes close to the tone and voice Ministral offers. So, I’m on a hunt to understand if there’s anything that can tame this obsessive looping and poor instruction-following.",

      "text": "Hello, I am going to explain how I see the current available tools to try to generate a discussion with the goal of understanding the use of each of the tools or if I am looking for something that's not realistic or not yet ready.\n\nI am learning to use Mistral's technologies to develop various agents to implement in my company. I understand there are mainly 4 products: Le Chat, AI Studio, API and now Mistral Vibe (cool v2 just released), besides all the enterprise coding thing, compute... they have a lot of stuff and what seems to be a solid business model, not like their competition playing at valuations. Well.\n\nIn Le Chat we get a chat interface to interact with the models. There you can create Agents that use the default model which I assume is Mistral Medium, we can set Instructions, Guardrails, Tone and Knowledge. Under knowledge, tools and connectors can be chosen, as well as Libraries o documents inside those libraries. Those Libraries are created under Intelligence > Libraries, where you see all the libraries being created in both possible origins: the uploaded files in Projects or in the Libraries section. \n\nWhy aren't the Libraries created in the Projects section available in the New Chat + (plus or context button) section? Libraries created in Projects don't seem to be available there. Also when accessing what I just called the New Chat interface in the Projects section, that Library seems to not be used anyways. \n\nBack to the Agent creation, AI Studio offers an Agent Builder where we can choose the model, set configuration (temp, max\\_t, top\\_p), choose which Tools will be available, Response Format and Instructions. Here, Knowledge (context) can't be added as it is in Le Chat. I understand that Libraries can be created in Le Chat or using the API and then passed as a function for the Agent created in AI Studio to use. I see that all this can be done using the APIs available.\n\nI understand that Agents created in AI Studio can be Deployed in Le Chat and there a Library created in the Libraries section can be manually added. But that feels very awkward.\n\nReading my self back, this is a mess, but I reflects my current state of not knowing what to do where, with the only goal of using their tools in the most comfortable way possible.\n\nCan anyone share their workflow so I can have it as reference?\n\nIs it just me not understanding their set of tools? (Very probable) or maybe this will be ordered in some way in the future.\n\nHope this turns out to be productive and thanks to anyone that takes the time to comment.",

Aside from grammar explanations, I use it to practice translating short texts. I would ask him to give me a short story (like 1 paragraph) in either Italian or English and then to give me feedback on my translation.\n\nAt first it worked quite well. It gave me a story about \"an autumn weekend\" and another about a \"traditional recipe\", and the corrections and feedback of my translations were pretty accurate and relevant.\n\nBut then the stories seemed very repetitive. Some specific aspects kept reappearing after doing this a couple of times (in separate chats). Every text it produced included something about \"breathing the fresh air\" or \"the smell of vegetables\". This became a bit annoying because I’d like to practice on varied topics. Even when deleting the previous chats it continued.\n\nSo I looked into the memories Le Chat had about me. There was basically the whole texts that he had produced the first time we did the exercise saved as a memory. But they were not saved as \"texts we practiced with\", instead it saved the information from the texts he had produced as memories about me. So for example, he thought that I \"cook pasta with my grandma every weekend\" and saved it as a memory, even though he’s the one who wrote it in his text.\n\nSo I deleted all the fake memories he had saved about me and all the chats. Now it seems to work again.\n\nAnyways, I’m just curious about how it decides to store memories and if this is normal.",
