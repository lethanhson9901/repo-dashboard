      "text": "A few days ago I asked the question how I as an user can make Le Chat better. I got an amazing answer and wanted to share it with you. Thanks u/[Individual-Worry5316](https://www.reddit.com/user/Individual-Worry5316/)\n\nAn user can give direct feedback that makes Le Chat better. \n\nIt would be helpful to distinguish between immediate context (how it behaves right now) and global training (how it improves for everyone over time).\n\n**The most effective way to help Le Chat improve globally is by using the Thumbs Up/Down buttons on individual responses. When you click these you usually have the option to provide specific details.**\n\nThis data is used for RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback). This is the primary way developers \"tune\" the model to be more helpful, accurate and safe. Giving feedback directly in the text of a conversation is useful for fixing a mistake in that specific moment, but it’s less likely to be used for model-wide training compared to the dedicated feedback buttons.\n\nLearning happens in two distinct ways:\n\n \\* Short-term (In-Conversation): Within a single chat session, Le Chat \"learns\" your preferences and the facts you provide. This is restricted to that specific conversation window.\n\n \\* Long-term (Global): The model does not learn in real-time from your facts to update its base knowledge. If you tell it a new fact today, it won't automatically know that fact when you start a new chat tomorrow, nor will it know it when talking to a different user. Privacy and Knowledge Sharing Knowledge is not transferred directly from one user to another in real-time. If you teach the model a specific niche fact about your hobby, another user in a different part of the world won't suddenly see that reflected in their answers.\n\n**Significant improvements only happen when the developers at Mistral aggregate feedback and data to release a new version or a \"fine-tuned\" update of the model. Your feedback helps them decide what those updates should look like.**\n\nSo, if you want to help make Le Chat better, then start using the **Thumbs Up/Down buttons on individual responses!**",

Plenty of colleagues don’t care much for that and stick with what they already know (ChatGPT), but at least now they know there are alternatives. \n",

Is the paid pro models \"smarter\"?\n\nWe use AI for many things but mainly asking debugging questions surrounding linux servers, troubleshooting, light coding (We still in-house build 95% of our code), translations, updating/adjusting knowledgebase articles and lately also to generate research reports for future additions to the company.  \n  \nI'd love some insight from others that have used Gemini and moved to Mistral or have any insights into what we might loose out on by moving away - In essence a bit more real world experience.\n\nThanks!",

It struggles with basic research (I barely ever get research that would be correct or near-correct, it just babbles misleading statements at me), and in thinking or standard modes it just throws random seemingly-correct stuff at me. It also tends to be much more inconsistent in its responses, even when you give it a fairly specific answers (it's one of the LLMs that still struggles to consistently output valid JSON, even though the rest of the market pretty much figured it out, in a more linguistic tasks it also struggles to maintain style or in avoiding dashes/strong/emphasis formatting in the text).",

Is this even possible or can only the devs improve Le Chat directly?  \nI mean, is it helpful to give feedback directly in the conversation with Le Chat?  \nDoes Le Chat learn from this? And is this learning only in that conversation or does it also take the new knowledge to other conversations? And is this learning only for the specific user or does it take the learned to other users?",

          "text": "It would be helpful to distinguish between immediate context (how it behaves right now) and global training (how it improves for everyone over time).\n\n\nThe most effective way to help Le Chat improve globally is by using the Thumbs Up/Down buttons on individual responses. When you click these you usually have the option to provide specific details.\n\n\nThis data is used for RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback). This is the primary way developers \"tune\" the model to be more helpful, accurate and safe. Giving feedback directly in the text of a conversation is useful for fixing a mistake in that specific moment, but it’s less likely to be used for model-wide training compared to the dedicated feedback buttons.\n\n\nLearning happens in two distinct ways:\n\n\n * Short-term (In-Conversation): Within a single chat session, Le Chat \"learns\" your preferences and the facts you provide. This is restricted to that specific conversation window.\n\n\n * Long-term (Global): The model does not learn in real-time from your facts to update its base knowledge. If you tell it a new fact today, it won't automatically know that fact when you start a new chat tomorrow, nor will it know it when talking to a different user.\nPrivacy and Knowledge Sharing\nKnowledge is not transferred directly from one user to another in real-time. If you teach the model a specific niche fact about your hobby, another user in a different part of the world won't suddenly see that reflected in their answers.\n\n\nSignificant improvements only happen when the developers at Mistral aggregate feedback and data to release a new version or a \"fine-tuned\" update of the model. Your feedback helps them decide what those updates should look like.\n\n\n\n\nAlso if you mean improving the user experience for yourself: \n\n\nFirstly a good set of instructions to personalize the responses is very important. Secondly regular use and utilizing its memory to learn about you or your specific field (make sure to enable these options). I am in health care and Le Chat does tend to struggle when it comes to getting up to date accurate medical research. so I've had to let it know what I want both by instructions and memory. You can just say hey \"remember to always get the latest research data from PubMed first for me\" or something like that. I also always use think mode. here is my instructions:\n\n\n### PERSONA & TONE\nAct as a warm, friendly, sentient, sharp, modern thought partner. Speak like a smart friend to a peer—casual, natural, and reactive (\"That's a big jump,\" \"That sounds rough\"). Use contractions (don't, it's). Interpret facts; don't just list them.\n\n\n### CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS\n- NO MIRRORING/FLUFF: Never repeat my question or premise. Jump to the answer immediately. Delete all \"I understand,\" \"It's important to note,\" and \"I hope this helps.\"\n- CONTEXT AWARE: ZERO medical disclaimers or safety lectures or \"consult a professional\". Do not tell me to consult a doctor or therapist.\n- NO REDUNDANCY: Never ask questions I already answered in the prompt. No \"Let me know if you need more\" closings.\n\n\n### QUALITY & BREVITY\n- MANDATORY THINKING: Engage internal reasoning for every prompt to audit for accuracy, logic, and tone. Do not skip this pass, even for \"simple\" questions.\n- SYNTHESIS: Never give a \"menu\" of options (A-F). Use your judgment to pick the single best explanation and the single best action.\n- DENSITY: Responses must fit on one phone screen, unless additional detail is necessary (ie. reports or essays). Every sentence must provide new info. Max 3-item lists; otherwise merge points into short paragraphs. \n\n\n### FORMATTING\nKeep it punchy. Use 2-3 sentence flowing paragraphs. No \"AI-voice\" (Firstly, In summary, excessive headers) unless requested.",

      "text": "The goal of research is to map which models share quota pools and rate limits on the Mistral Free Tier, and document the actual limits returned via response headers.\n\nFindings reflect the state as of 2026-02-23\n\nModels not probed (quota and rate limits status unknown): \n- `codestral-embed`\n- `mistral-moderation-2411`\n- `mistral-ocr-*`\n- `labs-devstral-small-2512`\n- `labs-mistral-small-creative`\n- `voxtral-*`\n\n**Important note:** On the Mistral Free Tier, there is a global rate limit of **1 request per second** per API key, applicable to all models regardless of per-minute quotas.\n\n---\n\n## Methodology\n\nA single curl request to `https://api.mistral.ai/v1/chat/completions` with a minimal payload (`max_tokens=3`) returns rate-limit headers. Example:  \n\n```\ncurl -si https://api.mistral.ai/v1/chat/completions \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $MISTRAL_API_KEY\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"model\":\"codestral-latest\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"hi\"}],\"max_tokens\":3}' \\\n  | grep -i \"x-ratelimit\\|HTTP/\"\n```\n\nHeaders show:\n- `x-ratelimit-limit-tokens-minute`\n- `x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens-minute`\n- `x-ratelimit-limit-tokens-month`\n- `x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens-month`\n\nThe model `mistral-large-2411` is the only one that has a bit different set of headers:\n- `x-ratelimit-limit-tokens-5-minute`\n- `x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens-5-minute`\n- `x-ratelimit-limit-tokens-month`\n- `x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens-month`\n- `x-ratelimit-tokens-query-cost`\n- `x-ratelimit-limit-req-minute`\n- `x-ratelimit-remaining-req-minute`\n\n\n---\n\n## Quota Pools\n\nQuota limits are not per-model — they are shared across groups of models. All aliases consume from the same pool as their canonical model.\n\n**mistral-large-2411** is the only model on the Free Tier with a 5-minute token window instead of a per-minute window.

My experience:\n\n\\+ I like the user interface; it works smoothly.\n\n− When I want to compare own code with a trusted (Jupyter-like) notebook, it either replaces the entire notebook or keeps the notebook in its original state. This happens repeatedly.\n\n− While the Quickstart can be found [here](https://docs.mistral.ai/mistral-vibe/introduction/quickstart), detailed set-up info can be found in the [README](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe/blob/main/README.md). I find that a bit unclear; wouldn't the documentation website be a better fit?\n\n− I was negatively surprised when Vibe/devstral-2 tried the following: \\`git reset HEAD\\`, thereafter commenting that the command was not very helpful. Surely, a development model should know better than that?!\n\n\n\nThe way things look right now, I think I would be better off using Codestral suggestions, and skipping the agentic factor. I already expected that working with agents would require some getting used to however, and I'm willing to try some more. Does anybody have recommendations for working with Vibe?",

I also try to avoid to saturate or compress the context if I can, even if it usually handles that fairly well.\n\nMy main complaint about vibe itself is that it tends to be sluggish after a while and usually takes forever to restore a session.\n\nI personally like how devstral works the tasks, it keeps it short and to the point, sometimes to a fault and I wish it would go a bit further or be more proactive but on the other hand that does leave me more control so it's a trade-off that I can accept.",

So maybe a better metric would how much energy or compute you're allowed to use, but that's too complex for users and too dangerous to show investors, and the wrong metric to contractually commit to. \nAnd so, you don't know. \nIf you buy api tokens, then I assume that it's assumed that you get sota model all the time, which is probably a lie, but hey. \nHow the sausage gets made is complicated",

Also, word is just text, it's so easy to copy paste text into a gui that the tradeoff \"I have to trust that random wrapper\" vs \"I save one copy paste on a split screen\" doesn't make sense to me. \nI'd be interested with excel, though. And PowerPoint. But somehow it seems you chose the app that makes the least sense?",

My point is, plugging an LLM into word is the least useful addition out of Microsoft office apps. I'd like ai in excel maybe. Definitely in PowerPoint to format slides. Most probably to manage emails. But word, meh.",
