      "text": "\n\n**English summary of the Xataka article (Summary by Le Chat):**\n\nMistral AI, the Paris-based startup, is quietly achieving remarkable growth without the typical hype surrounding AI companies. Unlike its competitors, Mistral has avoided inflating stock prices but now generates more revenue than Elon Musk’s Grok. According to CEO Arthur Mensch, Mistral’s annualized revenue run rate has surged from $20 million to over $400 million in just one year—a twentyfold increase. The company, valued at €12 billion in 2025, is on track to exceed $1 billion in annual recurring revenue by the end of 2026, driven by its focus on European technological sovereignty.\n\nMistral’s strategy centers on serving enterprise clients rather than end users, positioning itself as the go-to alternative for European businesses seeking independence from U.S. or Chinese AI infrastructure. With over 100 major corporate clients, including ASML, TotalEnergies, HSBC, and governments like France, Germany, and Greece, 60% of its revenue comes from Europe. Its appeal lies in offering locally hosted, low-emission AI solutions, aligning with Europe’s push to reduce reliance on foreign tech giants.\n\nThe company recently announced a €1.2 billion investment in a new data center in Sweden, its first outside France, set to open in 2027. Sweden was chosen for its affordable, low-carbon energy, reinforcing Mistral’s commitment to sustainable, sovereign AI infrastructure. Mensch criticized the trend of U.S. hyperscalers building data centers in Europe, arguing that such projects primarily benefit American companies rather than European interests.\n\nMistral’s success is underpinned by its unique position as Europe’s only major developer of foundational large language models (LLMs). While it collaborates with global players like Microsoft and NVIDIA, its core mission remains empowering European autonomy in AI. As Mensch stated, Europe’s excessive dependence on U.S. digital services has reached a critical juncture, and Mistral provides a viable, independent alternative.\n\nBy combining rapid expansion with a principled stance on data sovereignty, Mistral is reshaping the AI landscape—proving that discretion and strategic focus can outperform noise.  \n  \n[https://www.xataka.com/robotica-e-ia/mistral-ia-que-mejor-esta-jugando-sus-cartas-porque-esta-aprovechando-fiebre-soberania-tecnologica-europea](https://www.xataka.com/robotica-e-ia/mistral-ia-que-mejor-esta-jugando-sus-cartas-porque-esta-aprovechando-fiebre-soberania-tecnologica-europea)\n\n[https://x.com/paulbz/status/2021537295883481437](https://x.com/paulbz/status/2021537295883481437)",

A proper websearch sub-agent with actual query capabilities would let it find relevant sources first, then fetch.\n\n\n- Smarter plan mode — Better guidelines in system prompt, auto-clear stale context once a plan is approved, so execution starts with a clean, focused window.",

I liked the agent and library options, and of course, the UI, which is genuinely well designed. I noticed along the way that it’s not on par with ChatGPT when it comes to generating images, videos, or live AI conversations, and that my native language (Serbian) is significantly less well adapted. However, on the other hand, I appreciated the agent options, the library, and the flexibility of customization and optimization. For my use cases where I use AI 80% of the time for interpreting and organizing emails, translating texts from one language to another, web searches, and similar tasks I realized that for a much more affordable price, I could get a similar experience to ChatGPT for my needs.\n\nYesterday, I decided to pay for the annual Pro subscription and cancel my ChatGPT subscription.\n\nToday, I already feel like I made a mistake and regret that decision.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nIntelligence (Beta): In my humble opinion, it doesn’t even deserve to be called an Alpha version.\n\n1. Memories: Simply put, they don’t work. I’ve tried everything adding my own memories in English, in Serbian, letting Le Chat add them based on our conversations and nothing. In every new chat, it’s as if it doesn’t take a single memory into account.\n\nExample: As a joke today, I tried that challenge where people mocked ChatGPT for giving the wrong answer to the question, \"If I need to wash my car and the car wash is 200 meters away, should I go by car or on foot?\" ChatGPT always said to go on foot, while Claude gave the correct answer that you have to go by car because it understood the context. I tried it in Le Chat, and of course, it failed just like ChatGPT did, even after multiple attempts and using thinking mode.\n\nThis isn’t even my biggest problem, although one of the first memories I set was that Le Chat should always think carefully and verify all circumstances and sources before giving an answer, as accuracy takes priority over speed. I also specified that it should always respond to me in the same language I write in (Serbian) during casual communication and never use em dashes. The result? Out of 10 new chats where I asked the same question about the car and the car wash, I got 10 wrong answers, mixed with Serbian and Croatian, and responses full of em dashes. Because of my frustrated replies, Le Chat kept adding new memories that it should never use Croatian words or em dashes (there are now about five memories for each issue), and yet, in every new conversation, it keeps making the same mistakes it doesn’t understand the context, mixes languages, and uses em dashes.\n\n2. Connectors: Currently, only Gmail has any value for my use case, but unfortunately, it doesn’t work well. It can’t search through email threads, suggest a recipient’s email in drafts even though it’s in the emails, or directly create a template that can be automatically forwarded to Gmail.\n\n3. Libraries: On the surface, this seems like a very useful feature that could replace NotebookLM for me, but it’s often ignored in responses. The agent quickly scans the library and gives a quick answer without tying the context of the question to the library or finding relevant connections.\n\n4. Instructions: I’ve already mentioned how memories are simply bypassed in most cases, and the same goes for the instructions I set at the very beginning. As I also said, one of the first instructions was that it should always take the time to analyze the question and provide the most accurate answer, no matter how long it takes. Yet, I keep getting hasty and incorrect responses.\n\nExample: I asked for the average price of a specific car model in Serbia, and it kept giving me a price that was double the actual amount. I kept challenging it, knowing it was wrong not by 1,000 euros, but instead of around 6,000 euros, it kept giving me a figure of 12,000 euros, without ever providing a concrete link or links where it found those prices. After about 10 exchanges, it still couldn’t give me a single link, it just kept hallucinating and making up numbers. Then I sent it a link I found for such a car priced at around 6,000 euros, and it replied that the link didn’t show the price or mileage (even though everything was clearly visible on the link).\n\nAll of this tells me that Mistral’s Le Chat project is primarily focused on providing a good interface for developers and coding, where things are fairly clear and logical, and response speed is most valued. Unfortunately, this severely undermines the versatility that Le Chat promotes, because in the pursuit of speed, it completely disregards all instructions and tools from Intelligence.\n\nAs a result, we have an effectively unfinished and unreliable product that’s very difficult to rely on for daily needs, especially since the AI is marketed and promoted as something that can replace all everyday operations but clearly, it’s not adapted for that.\n\nI sincerely hope someone from the Mistral team sees this post and responds by enabling Le Chat to process and respect instructions from Intelligence. If necessary, there should be a switch or option to directly instruct the AI to always strictly follow instructions and go through memories, even if it means slower response generation.\n\nOtherwise, this will forever remain a project that will never come close to the big competitors from the US and China.",

It can be a resource expensive process if done wrong but by looking at the work going on with vibe, it seems that they are going in the right direction, imo.",

Saying nothing works is just wrong and bad feedback. Imo.",

This is why they are selling generic API keys or products, since these can scale quickly to tens of billions. \n\nHowever, many businesses are not looking for the best model, but rather the best integration with their data, privacy, sometimes requiring fine-tuning and custom solutions. This is very demanding in terms of human resources, as it means dealing with customers one-by-one and sending engineers to design their specific solutions. This is why big US companies avoid this, therefore Mistral is in a blue ocean by pursuing it. For sure, this business will not scale to $100B in revenue within three years (which is what the US companies want), but it can become a successful multi-billion dollar business and once a client has a deep integration, the churn rate will be very low, even if the model is slightly behind the current SOTA.",

      "text": "Was going through Vibe [v2.1.0 diff](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe/compare/v2.0.2...v2.1.0) out of curiosity and found a bunch of code that's not mentioned anywhere in the changelog.\n\n\n\n*Disclaimer: this is all from reading public source code, nothing confirmed by Mistral, everything behind disabled feature flags. If the team would rather I didn't share, happy to take it down.*\n\n\n\nThere's a hidden `/teleport` command that packages your entire Vibe session and sends it to something called \"Mistral Nuage.\" The config points to a staging domain, and the TODOs in the code say things like \"remove once the feature is publicly available.\" So it's not ready yet, but it's coming.\n\n\n\nThe part that got me interested is a fully implemented but commented-out method called `create_le_chat_thread()`. Rather than landing on some internal console, your teleported session would open as a Le Chat conversation with a cloud sandbox attached to your repo. So basically, \n\n\n**Vibe is coming to Le Chat**.\n\n\n\nRight now Vibe is terminal-only. What Mistral is building is a web coding agent inside Le Chat, backed by cloud environments that can clone your repos and apply your local changes. You'll be able to start a task in your terminal and pick it up in the browser, or the other way around, without losing any context. The upcoming underlying platform, Mistral Nuage, handles all of it: spinning up environments, running workflows, managing the back and forth. It's a new product entirely.\n\n\n\nLe Chat already has MCP connectors, so it can interact with external services. But it still needs you in the loop, watching it, prompting it. What Nuage would change is that Le Chat could go off on its own. Spin up a sandbox, clone your repo, work through a task, push code, all without you sitting there. It goes from an assistant that can use tools when you ask, to an agent that can take a job and run with it in the background, having automated daily routines, pre-programmed tasks, auto-trigger (receiving an email etc.). It basically shifts the paradigm from synchronous to asynchronous (= Le Chat can work when you sleep aha).  And the workflow system seems rather generic, GitHub is just the first connector. There's room for email, project management, CI, whatever.\n\n\n\nEverything on the Vibe side looks done and well-tested, so they're probably finalizing the infrastructure and the web interface. Wouldn't be surprised to see this in the next few weeks.",

Strong workflow foundations with an engine that doesn't burn tokens like it's a coal furnace. Mistral's models have already great personalizations and with a sandbox-first approach it can be a real agent that doesn't work for you without being a ... \"click bait machine\".\n\nIf they call it something like \"Vision\", at least internally, I would literally lose my mind 🤣 (or even \"butter\", if you know what I mean...)\n\nps. I saw the diff but didn't had the time to dig through, thank you for doing it!",

Lately Gemini has felt a little more stale (gives reports on the wrong topics, Gems outputs are vague and they hallucinate a lot, etc.) \n\nI am thinking of changing the Gemini chat with mistral, I used mistral in the past, but it wasn’t the best experience.\n\nWhat is the state of Mistral currently? Is it on par with Gemini? \n\nI am grateful for your perspectives and insights! ",

          "text": "Language understanding != world understanding 😄\n\nI asked Mistral the following question (as it failed to give the correct answer for me aswell):\n\nI’ve played with embeddings a while back; “I want to wash my car” and “I want to wash my <whatever>” have the same cosine similarity and thus intent. The car is metadata for the intent and the intent is in a different sentence than the actual question “should I walk or go by car”, right? Is this the root of this gotcha perhaps, or don’t you use embeddings this way?\n\nAnswer (pretty interesting deeper dive):\n\nYou’re absolutely diving into the heart of the issue! Let’s break it down technically and conceptually:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Embeddings and Intent Recognition**\nYou’re right: In a pure embedding space (e.g., using models like BERT, Ada, or others), the sentences *\"I want to wash my car\"* and *\"I want to wash my dog\"* might have **high cosine similarity** for the *intent* of \"washing something.\" The object being washed (car, dog, etc.) is often treated as a \"slot\" or metadata, while the core intent (\"washing\") dominates the semantic representation.\n\n- **Intent:** \"I want to wash [X]\"\n- **Question:** \"Should I walk or drive?\"\n\nWhen processed separately, the model may not strongly link the object ([X] = car) to the decision (walk/drive) unless the context is explicitly connected. The **intent** (\"washing\") and the **logistical question** (\"walk or drive\") are parsed as somewhat independent clauses, especially if the model isn’t explicitly trained to resolve such dependencies.\n\n---\n\n### **2. The Gotcha: Contextual Dependency**\nThe \"gotcha\" arises because:\n- **Humans** automatically infer that washing a car requires the car to be present at the location, so the *object* (car) is critical to the decision.\n- **Embeddings** (in isolation) may not always capture this **causal dependency** unless the model is fine-tuned or the context is tightly coupled. The relationship between \"washing a car\" and \"needing the car at the car wash\" is **world knowledge**, not just semantic similarity.\n- **Multi-sentence reasoning:** The model processes your input as two separate statements. The intent (\"wash my car\") and the question (\"walk or drive?\") are not inherently linked unless the model’s attention mechanism or context window explicitly connects them.\n\n---\n\n### **3. How Models Like Mine Handle This**\n- **Attention mechanisms** (in transformers) try to weigh the importance of each word/phrase relative to others, but they’re not perfect. If the context is split across sentences, the model might not always \"realize\" that the car’s presence is required for the washing.\n- **World knowledge gaps:** While models like me have vast knowledge, we don’t always \"reason\" like humans. We rely on patterns in data, and if the training data doesn’t emphasize the dependency (e.g., \"washing a car requires the car to be at the car wash\"), the model might miss it.\n- **No explicit \"common sense\" module:** Unlike humans, we don’t have an innate understanding of physics or practical constraints (e.g., you can’t wash a car without the car being there). This is a known challenge in AI.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Why This is Hard to Fix**\n- **Data sparsity:** Most training data doesn’t contain trick questions or explicitly teach these dependencies.\n- **Ambiguity:** In everyday language, people rarely ask, \"Should I walk or drive to wash my car?\" with the car’s presence as the crux. So, the model isn’t primed to spot the inconsistency.\n- **Embeddings alone aren’t enough:** Resolving this requires **reasoning** (e.g., \"Does the object need to be at the location for the intent to be fulfilled?\"). This is an active area of research (e.g., commonsense reasoning, causal inference).\n\n---\n\n### **5. How to Improve This?**\n- **Fine-tuning:** Train on datasets with explicit examples of such dependencies.\n- **Prompt engineering:** Frame the input to force the model to connect the dots (e.g., *\"I want to wash my car at a car wash 50m away. Should I walk or drive there, given that the car needs to be washed?\"*).\n- **Hybrid systems:** Combine embeddings with symbolic logic or knowledge graphs to enforce constraints (e.g., \"washing a car → car must be present\").\n\n---\n\n### **6. The Bigger Picture**\nModels excel at patterns but struggle with implicit assumptions humans take for granted. It’s why AI can be brilliant at some tasks and hilariously off on others!\n\n—",

To achieve the objective \"wash my car at the station,\" the car must physically travel to the station.\n\nSince the car must move, you are facing an optimization problem regarding *how* and *when* it moves to minimize engine wear.\n\n### The Optimal Solution: Trip Chaining\n\nDo not make a dedicated trip just to wash the car. A 50-meter drive is indeed the worst operational case for an engine (running rich, high friction, condensation buildup in exhaust/oil without proper burnout).\n\n**Recommendation:** Wait until you are leaving for a longer drive (e.g., commuting to work or going to the store) or returning from one.\n\n* **Why:** If you wash it at the start of a trip, the subsequent driving burns off the condensation and warms the oil. If you wash it at the end, the engine is already warm. In both cases, the \"wear cost\" of the wash becomes negligible.\n\n### The Theoretical Minimum: Manual Propulsion\n\nIf you must wash the car *right now* and absolutely refuse to start the engine, you can put the car in neutral and push it the 50 meters to the station.\n\n* **Why:** This technically satisfies all constraints (clean car + zero engine starts).\n* **Caveat:** This is physically demanding, potentially unsafe on a public road, and you may still need to start the engine to exit the automated bay or operate power brakes/steering.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**Do not walk.** Do not drive *just* to wash. **Chain the wash to a longer trip.**\n\n---\n\n### Assumptions & Boundary Conditions\n\nThis answer relies on the following assumptions:\n\n1. **Stationary Facility:** The \"automated station\" is a fixed location and does not offer a mobile service.\n2. **Car Dependency:** The objective is to wash the specific vehicle mentioned, which requires the vehicle's physical presence at the station.\n3. **No Home Equipment:** You do not have a hose and bucket at your current location (which would be the true zero-wear solution).\n\n### Deliberation Summary\n\n* **Initial position:** Walking is illogical because the car cannot get washed if it is left behind.\n* **Strongest challenge:** The \"Optimizer\" lens noted that simply pointing out the logical error (leaving the car behind) doesn't solve the user's valid concern about engine wear. The user needs a strategy to wash the car without incurring the specific damage they fear.\n* **Resolution:** The answer integrates \"Trip Chaining.\" This acknowledges that while the car must move, the *timing* of that movement is the variable to optimize. This allows the user to use the station without incurring the \"cold start penalty\" of a dedicated short trip.",

Plus, unless you have a very long extension cord or a mobile detailing kit, you can't exactly bring the car wash to the car!\n\n# Why Driving Wins\n\n* **Logistics:** Most car washes require the vehicle to be positioned in a specific bay or on a conveyor belt.\n* **Efficiency:** It will take you about 5 seconds to drive there versus 45 seconds to walk.\n* **The Goal:** Since the objective is to get the *car* clean, the car needs to make the trip.\n\n# When to Walk\n\nThe only reason to walk those 50 meters is if you are heading there to **book an appointment** or check if there is a long line before you bother pulling the car out of the driveway.\n\n**Pro-tip:** If it's a sunny day, driving that short distance won't even give your engine time to warm up, so just take it slow!\n\nWould you like me to check the **weather forecast** for your area to make sure it’s not going to rain right after you finish?",

This is strange....\n\nI asked LeChat the following question (I really wanted to find this out):\n\n`There is a video called \"Rhapsodie in Blech\" (for example, here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGUQh8-d2bc)`  \n`The cars there are test cars driven by professionals to check how they behave in tricky situations, or are these regular car owners?`\n\nThe answer was \"I was unable to access the specific content of the video directly, but based on general knowledge and the context of videos like \"Rhapsodie in Blech\" (which is a well-known German TV show), the cars are test cars driven by professional drivers. ....\"\n\nThis is fatally wrong.  \nI copy pasted the same question to gemini, chatgpt and proton lumo. They all answered correctly. Like:\n\n`“Rhapsodie in Blech” is a compilation of crash footage that was filmed in 1970 on the Nürburgring’s Adenauer‑Forst section. The material comes from the private camera work of Jürgen Sander (and later Manfred Förster), who stood at the side of the track and recorded ordinary drivers attempting laps on the “Green Hell....”`\n\nThe title of the film is rather unuque; you do not need to \"watch\" video to answer the question.\n\nYes, LLMs do mistakes, I know. But for this kind of question, I expect a correct answer.  And all except Mistral delivered it.\n\nI like Mistral - EU, not a that big tech and so on - all that is great. But after this experience I'm not sure that I can use Mistral for anything. Really, really said.",

The cars shown are driven by regular car owners, not professional test drivers. The compilation is famous for capturing the often chaotic and sometimes reckless driving behavior of amateur drivers on the track during public or \"tourist\" driving days, rather than controlled testing by professionals. The video highlights how ordinary enthusiasts pushed their cars—and sometimes their luck—to the limit, resulting in numerous crashes and mishaps  ​⁠.\n\nIn summary: these are regular car owners, not professional test drivers. The video is a historical snapshot of amateur driving on one of the world’s most challenging race tracks.",

After that i start asking it to make a plan and where it thinks it should start and just let it start generating code there.

If I make a correction, Le Chat takes it upon itself to begin to make memories with rules that it \"understands\" in some way but that are not what I meant or not what I said, then I have to argue with it while it keeps trying to move on to something I don't want, or worse, says \"I misunderstood you\" then proceeds to \"understand\" something else and make further memories. \n\nHow do you talk to this thing? Its compulsion of making memories that are either irrelevant or out of its 0s and 1s ass is desperating. \n\nIf you have experience, let me know. Not even 5.2 made me this angry at a robot xD",

Worst is when it denies my observations, basically gaslighting me.\nI've noticed mistral takes instructions very literally, so you need to be super precise. And when it thinks it's right, it simply does not even acknowledge what you're saying, until you give the precise instructions (eg use my github connector to verify xxx - you can't just say 'I'm telling you it's not there', it won't believe you).\n\nI would have kicked this cat a few times definitely.",

The more complex the prompt and content the less capable Mistral is to do it all at once. If you do one API call for side characters, one for the main character, one for a suggestion of story progression and one to stitch it all together, then you'll have a much better result. The same goes for memories. \n\nIt's generally hard to tell you what you could improve about memories as you are not really explaining what technically happens, how you process memories, what you expect to happen versus what happens, etc",
