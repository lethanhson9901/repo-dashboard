The deal places generative artificial intelligence at the heart of the nation’s military strategy.\n\nThe Ministry of the Armed Forces signs a strategic framework agreement with Mistral AI for national defense AI.\n© Alexandre Boero / Clubic\n\nCan we speak of a technological turning point for the French armed forces and defense? On Thursday, January 8, 2026, the Ministry of the Armed Forces and Veterans Affairs announced it had formalized a framework agreement with Mistral AI. The partnership aims to equip all branches of the French military with cutting-edge generative artificial intelligence. This decision establishes the leading French AI company as a cornerstone of national technological sovereignty in defense—a sector marked by fierce international competition.\n\nMistral AI’s AI Deployed Across All French Armed Forces\nThe agreement between the Ministry of the Armed Forces and Mistral AI grants access to the models, software, and AI services developed by the company co-founded by Arthur Mensch. All branches, directorates, and services under the ministry will now be able to utilize these advanced solutions. This large-scale deployment profoundly transforms the technological capabilities of French defense and underscores the trust placed in national expertise.\n\nThe scope extends far beyond the armed forces alone. Several public institutions under the ministry’s supervision will also benefit from this access, including the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), the French Aerospace Lab (ONERA), and the Naval Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service (SHOM).\n\nThe Ministry’s Agency for Defense Artificial Intelligence (AMIAD) has been tasked with overseeing the entire initiative. Created to accelerate the development and integration of AI within the armed forces, the agency will now orchestrate this strategic partnership. Bertrand Rondepierre, its director, states, “By integrating Mistral AI’s most advanced solutions, we are strengthening our position and preparing the armed forces for future challenges.”\n\nMaintaining France’s Technological Lead in AI\nMistral AI, now regarded as one of the global leaders in generative AI, boasts a research and development team considered “among the best in the world” by the ministry. This is a decisive advantage in a rapidly evolving sector, where each technological breakthrough can shift strategic balances and redefine operational capabilities.\n\nThe ministry, undeterred by Mistral AI’s collaborations with major American players like NVIDIA, fully embraces the sovereign dimension of this partnership. Working with Mistral AI ensures “sovereign control over the tools used,” according to the official statement. From the state’s perspective, choosing a French company addresses the imperative of national independence in critical defense technologies.\n\n“It is crucial for France to maintain its technological lead,” the ministry emphasizes. The framework agreement embodies this ambition to make French excellence in AI a lever for military power and a bulwark against foreign technological dependencies in the years ahead.\n\"\"\"",

      "text": "Hi Le Chat team,\n\nI’ve been a long-time user and I really appreciate the work you’ve done, but I wanted to share some candid feedback and suggestions. I hope this can be helpful rather than just praise.\n\n**Why is Le Chat still using Mistral Medium?**  \nIs it because Cerebras doesn’t support Mistral Large? If that’s the case, I absolutely cannot accept using an older model – no compromises, absolutely not! Even without using flash mode, Le Chat should be running Mistral Large.\n\n**Default agent selection**  \nIt would be great to have the option to permanently set the default agent for new conversations. It’s quite tedious to manually switch from the default model to an agent every time.\n\n**Magistral series issues**\n\n• Circular answers  \nThe most critical problem with the Magistral models is circular answers. This improved quite a lot in the September update, but the issue still exists.\n\n• Response style  \nThere’s a huge difference in response style depending on whether Think mode is on or off. The style shouldn’t vary so dramatically, especially within the same conversation.\n\n• Instruction-following  \nThink mode sometimes seems to follow instructions less strictly – though maybe that’s just my perception. Instruction-following, especially in long conversations, should be improved.\n\nBecause of these issues, I hardly use Think mode at all right now. These problems are quite serious, and I hope they can be addressed as soon as possible.\n\n**Additional suggestions / hopes**\n\n* Adding TTS (voice conversation) would be amazing – I assume it wouldn’t be difficult for you.\n* Allowing responses from cheaper models after hitting daily limits could be helpful. Small 3 (14B) is actually excellent – why not use it?\n* Giving users choice of models (even just for paid users) would be great. At minimum, having 2–3 options like Mistral Large, Medium, and Small would let users have more control. Personally, I really like Small 3 (14B), and I think users also deserve transparency and choice.\n\nThese are my thoughts – to be frank, some of it is criticism. I don’t know how much Le Chat contributes to your revenue, or whether it’s a priority at all. But I sincerely hope it can improve. Right now, there are quite a few issues, and I believe constructive criticism may help more than praise.\n\nRegardless, I genuinely wish you all the best and hope Le Chat continues to grow and get better.",

Are we using Large 3?  \n\nIn recent weeks, I have noticed that the quality of responses varies greatly. And bottom line, I'm also getting fewer flash responses.\nSometimes the responses are really exceptionally good, and sometimes I feel like the model doesn't understand anything. \nAnd honestly, we just don't know what's currently being used. Sometimes I suspect it might be Large 3 and sometimes the model's answers are so off the mark that my local 14b models could have given better answers in LM Studio. \n\nAs for Think/Reasoning or the Magistral Model, the model loves math, physics, or legal contracts. It's not good at normal questions. This is in contrast to GPT 5 thinking, for example, which just felt like the better ChatGPT version for almost every situation imho. \nI had to learn to get used to the fact that Mistral takes a different approach here. \n\nOtherwise, I think your suggestions are quite good – model selection? It’s actually such a simple yet good idea that I wonder why they haven’t offered that yet tbh",

If you're american you may not notice, but there's a rather heavy undertone of normalised paternalism and pandering in that extreme customer service way that is downright disgusting here in Norway (If a company employee in Norway behaved as ChatGPT does, he or she would be guided to the door VERY quickly for being impossible to work with, it would creep out everyone within a mile)\n\nThe one thing that may prompt continued usage of ChatGPT, from where I'm standing, is the presence of TTS. That is a accessibility feature, and should really be seen as critical, especially from a European perspective, where inclusivity is deeply rooted at this point.\n\nThat being said, I am just speaking of myself. I allowed my ChatGPT subscription to expire on December 28th. I will admit the first few days were kinda painful due to how used I am to pull up the ChatGPT app when I need some quick LLM input, but at this point I feel like it was been a worthwhile detox.",

It pretends to be confused and does not give me answers, always asking for clarifications. I just switch to Gemini free in those cases and get good answers. It also has a tendency to get into infinite thinking loops.\n\n\nImage recognition lags begins badly.

      "text": "Full transparency before I begin. I work closely with the Kilo Code team. The team is very eager to test different AI models for coding-related tasks. And I wanted to share the results from the latest testing of free models for AI code review.\n\nThe testing included three models that are free to use in Kilo Code atm (MiniMax M2, Grok Code Fast 1, and Mistral Devstral 2). The models were tested using Kilo Code's AI Code Reviews feature.\n\n**Testing Methodology**\n\nA base project using TypeScript with the Hono web framework, Prisma ORM, and SQLite. The project implements a task management API with JWT authentication, CRUD operations for tasks, user management, and role-based access control. **T**he base code was clean and functional with no intentional bugs.\n\nFrom there,  a feature branch adding three new capabilities was created: a search system for finding users and tasks, bulk operations for assigning or updating multiple tasks at once, and CSV export functionality for reporting. This feature PR added roughly 560 lines across four new files.\n\nThe PR contained 18 intentional issues across six categories. We embedded these issues at varying levels of subtlety: some obvious (like raw SQL queries with string interpolation), some moderate (like incorrect pagination math), and some subtle (like asserting on the wrong variable in a test).\n\nTo ensure fair comparison, we used the identical commit for all three pull requests. Same code changes, same PR title (”Add user search, bulk operations, and CSV export”), same description. Each model reviewed the PR with Balanced Review Style. We set the maximum review time to 10 minutes, **though none of the models needed more than 5.**\n\nHere's a sneak peek at the results:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6acf77ovgjbg1.png?width=1334&format=png&auto=webp&s=69d802081d72d37cc10b34a91b0847b24dea2773\n\nAll three models correctly identified the SQL injection vulnerabilities, the missing admin authorization on the export endpoint, and the CSV formula injection risk. They also caught the loop bounds error and flagged the test file as inadequate.\n\nNone of the models produced false positives.\n\nWhat did each model do well?\n\nGrok Code Fast 1 completed its review in 2 minutes, less than half the time of the other models. It found the most issues (8) while producing zero false positives.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ra8t5cygjbg1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=377c20a5776597ba41501cd823cf407836e73348\n\nMiniMax M2 took a different approach from Grok Code Fast 1 and Devstral 2. Instead of posting a summary, it added inline comments directly on the relevant lines in the pull request. Each comment appeared in context, explaining the issue and providing a code snippet showing how to fix it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5jrpp1g2hjbg1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fc6ef77ce8fff59103c1b29ee0213ae5058b117\n\nDevstral 2 found fewer issues overall but caught something the other models missed: one endpoint didn’t use the same validation approach as the rest of the codebase.\n\nDevstral 2 also noted missing error handling around filesystem operations. The export endpoint used synchronous file writes without try-catch, meaning a disk full error or permission issue would crash the request handler. Neither Grok Code Fast 1 nor MiniMax M2 flagged this.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x492weh4hjbg1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=60f7cd09b159820b228211cca53d66531ded0a0d\n\nThere were also some additional valid findings. For example, each model also identified issues we hadn’t explicitly planted:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zt8k32r7hjbg1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=580530623e31ac6353250f5aaae5ad06e384b459\n\nEven though we didn’t explicitly plant these issues, they are real problems in the codebase that would’ve slipped through the cracks had we not used Code Reviews on this PR.\n\nFor catching the issues that matter most before they reach production, the free models deliver real value. They run in 2-5 minutes, cost nothing during the limited launch period, and catch problems that would otherwise slip through.\n\nIf anyone's interested in more details, here's a more detailed breakdown of the test -> [https://blog.kilo.ai/p/free-reviews-test](https://blog.kilo.ai/p/free-reviews-test)",

If you give them hidden trauma, hidden motives, or hidden twists, they will use it immediately because generalist models tend to push the story toward resolutions as fast as possible.  \nSo keep your character sheet minimal: public facts only.  \nAnything the LLM discovers *in-scene*, you can later add to your sheet.\n\n**About them meeting as strangers:**  \nNo problem at all.  \nOnly write what the rest of the characters really know, should be able to observe or infer.  \nAs the story progresses, you can update the sheet with things that become public or discovered naturally.\n\n**Checkpoints / Plot**  \nYour checkpoint method is great. I use something similar, but per chapter.  \nJust one important thing:  \nCreate checkpoints after the event has happened, not before.  \nIf you announce “In this chapter X will happen”, the LLM will accelerate the scene unnaturally to force that outcome.  \nIf you wait until the scene is done, then write the checkpoint, you get continuity without railroading.\n\nThis isn’t a Le Chat issue; it’s a general LLM behavior.  \nModels try to “close the loop” as soon as they see the target.  \nThe good thing is that Le Chat tends to feel less nanny and more willing to play along, so you’ll get nicer organic twists than in other platforms.  \n  \n**Stylebook / Rules / Setting**  \nYour RP rules look great.  \nAnd yes: if you have anything about setting, location, mood, red lines, boundaries, put it there too.  \nAll that helps the model stay consistent.\n\nYou’re on the right track 😊",

That's more than enough memory, the model loads successfully in ollama or LMStudio and chat works fine. But it doesn't seem to work well with coding UIs. Here's the different setups I've tried. In each case, I have a markdown file describing bugs in some code and I prompt the model to read the bug reports, and make changes to one code file that would address two issues.\n\n\\- Model served with \\`ollama run devstral-2\\`, used via \\`vibe\\`. The model asks me to make changes to files. I ask whether it can do it itself, it says \"Yes, I can write files using the write\\_file tool! I can create new files or overwrite existing ones. If you'd like me to write or modify a file, just let me know the file path and the content you'd like to include.\" But it doesn't use the tool. I asked it to, and it replied with \\`read\\_file\\[ARGS\\]{\"path\": \"filename\"}\\`, like the attempt to use a tool just appeared in the chat.\n\n\\- Model served in ollama, used via Roo Code. It asked to create a markdown file describing its changes, I told it not to and to fix the source file itself. It encountered \"API Request Failed: unexpected end of JSON input\".\n\n\\- Model served in ollama, used via Continue VSCodium extension. When I apply changes to the file, it just deletes the original content without adding its changes.\n\n\\- Model served in LMStudio, used via Roo Code. Attempts to use tools hit a prompt template error: \"Error rendering prompt with jinja template: \"After the optional system message, conversation roles must alternate user and assistant roles except for tool calls and results.\".\n\n\\- Model served in LMStudio, used via \\`vibe\\`. This is the only configuration I've tried that seems to work reliably. The model updates its TODOs correctly, and makes changes to files.\n\n\\- Model served in LMStudio, used via Continue. Tool use attempts just appear in the output stream.\n\n  \nHas anybody got a setup that works reliably they could share, please, or guidance to either diagnose these issues or route problem reports to the correct places?",
