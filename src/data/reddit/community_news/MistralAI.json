I've run Mistral Large and the older Medium behind corporate firewalls and the inference cost per token is genuinely competitive once you factor in not paying the OpenAI tax on every API call at scale.\n\nThe real question is whether Accenture's army of consultants can actually fine-tune and deploy these models competently or if they'll just wrap the API in a chatbot and call it \"AI transformation.\" Based on what I've seen from Big Four/Five consulting engagements, it's usually the latter until the client pushes back.\n\nMistral's advantage here is the EU angle. Half of Accenture's enterprise clients in Europe won't touch US-hosted inference for regulated workloads. That alone justifies the deal regardless of benchmark numbers.",

      "text": "A few days ago I asked the question how I as an user can make Le Chat better. I got an amazing answer and wanted to share it with you. Thanks u/[Individual-Worry5316](https://www.reddit.com/user/Individual-Worry5316/)\n\nAn user can give direct feedback that makes Le Chat better. \n\nIt would be helpful to distinguish between immediate context (how it behaves right now) and global training (how it improves for everyone over time).\n\n**The most effective way to help Le Chat improve globally is by using the Thumbs Up/Down buttons on individual responses. When you click these you usually have the option to provide specific details.**\n\nThis data is used for RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback). This is the primary way developers \"tune\" the model to be more helpful, accurate and safe. Giving feedback directly in the text of a conversation is useful for fixing a mistake in that specific moment, but it’s less likely to be used for model-wide training compared to the dedicated feedback buttons.\n\nLearning happens in two distinct ways:\n\n \\* Short-term (In-Conversation): Within a single chat session, Le Chat \"learns\" your preferences and the facts you provide. This is restricted to that specific conversation window.\n\n \\* Long-term (Global): The model does not learn in real-time from your facts to update its base knowledge. If you tell it a new fact today, it won't automatically know that fact when you start a new chat tomorrow, nor will it know it when talking to a different user. Privacy and Knowledge Sharing Knowledge is not transferred directly from one user to another in real-time. If you teach the model a specific niche fact about your hobby, another user in a different part of the world won't suddenly see that reflected in their answers.\n\n**Significant improvements only happen when the developers at Mistral aggregate feedback and data to release a new version or a \"fine-tuned\" update of the model. Your feedback helps them decide what those updates should look like.**\n\nSo, if you want to help make Le Chat better, then start using the **Thumbs Up/Down buttons on individual responses!**",

      "text": "II figured I’d give Mistral Vibe a go this month instead of Claude Code. I checked their site to see if there were any indicators of how many tokens I could burn through before being shut off (like with Claude). At the time of signing up for Vibe, the site only mentioned “generous usage,” so I had no idea when I’d hit any kind of limit. I saw nothing else and went on my way. I used it for a couple of weeks on some projects I was working on and didn’t love it or hate it. I was at dinner when I suddenly got an invoice for $280. I logged into the site and there is now a monthly usage tracker with “Pay as you go” set by default and, as far as I can tell, no way to turn it off. Safe to say I will not be using Mistral Vibe again. I guess this is more a PSA than anything, so check your Vibe usage.\n\nEdit: Because I should have mentioned it. Current Le Chat Pro subscriber.  \nEdit2: Even more wild I had thought something like this could happen, so I even capped my API usage at $20. I submitted a ticket with Mistral, will update.\n\n  \nUpdate 1: Someone from the Mistral team reached out and I emailed with them. I was told, “we have updated clearer usage monitoring in your Vibe page, and we will refund everyone impacted this month while this tracking was not in place.” I genuinely appreciate how quickly they resolved this, and I will update again when I see the chargeback hit my card.",

I have no idea when, as I never received any notification that pay-as-you-go had become the policy, nor that it couldn’t be turned off. The only API tracker visible on the page was one I’d set to a $20 per month maximum, and it still shows $0 in usage. I understand that the tracker probably applies to other API keys, but when I first set up Vibe, it was the only area on the entire page that had any form of API tracker or a way to set a usage limit, and it still is. \n\nHere is the newly implemented Vibe tracker. It does not even show how many tokens I have used on pay-as-you-go. It feels like they decided to start charging people before they actually rolled out the most important features: a way to set limits, turn it off, and a way to see what you have spent.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k8tswfvec0mg1.png?width=1142&format=png&auto=webp&s=06d0cd9b902c32219a102315ae3314ff5ad9179c\n\n",

A good basic model is one that knows when it doesn't know, instead of hallucinating it way out. Which basically comes down to following instructions.",

      "text": "The goal of research is to map which models share quota pools and rate limits on the Mistral Free Tier, and document the actual limits returned via response headers.\n\nFindings reflect the state as of 2026-02-23\n\nModels not probed (quota and rate limits status unknown): \n- `codestral-embed`\n- `mistral-moderation-2411`\n- `mistral-ocr-*`\n- `labs-devstral-small-2512`\n- `labs-mistral-small-creative`\n- `voxtral-*`\n\n**Important note:** On the Mistral Free Tier, there is a global rate limit of **1 request per second** per API key, applicable to all models regardless of per-minute quotas.\n\n---\n\n## Methodology\n\nA single curl request to `https://api.mistral.ai/v1/chat/completions` with a minimal payload (`max_tokens=3`) returns rate-limit headers. Example:  \n\n```\ncurl -si https://api.mistral.ai/v1/chat/completions \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $MISTRAL_API_KEY\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"model\":\"codestral-latest\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"hi\"}],\"max_tokens\":3}' \\\n  | grep -i \"x-ratelimit\\|HTTP/\"\n```\n\nHeaders show:\n- `x-ratelimit-limit-tokens-minute`\n- `x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens-minute`\n- `x-ratelimit-limit-tokens-month`\n- `x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens-month`\n\nThe model `mistral-large-2411` is the only one that has a bit different set of headers:\n- `x-ratelimit-limit-tokens-5-minute`\n- `x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens-5-minute`\n- `x-ratelimit-limit-tokens-month`\n- `x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens-month`\n- `x-ratelimit-tokens-query-cost`\n- `x-ratelimit-limit-req-minute`\n- `x-ratelimit-remaining-req-minute`\n\n\n---\n\n## Quota Pools\n\nQuota limits are not per-model — they are shared across groups of models. All aliases consume from the same pool as their canonical model.\n\n**mistral-large-2411** is the only model on the Free Tier with a 5-minute token window instead of a per-minute window. All other models use a 1-minute sliding window.\n\n---\n\n**Pool 1: Standard**\n\nLimits: 50,000 tokens/min | 4,000,000 tokens/month\n\n    mistral-small-2506, mistral-small-2501\n    mistral-large-2512\n    codestral-2508\n    open-mistral-nemo\n    ministral-3b-2512, ministral-8b-2512, ministral-14b-2512\n    devstral-small-2507, devstral-medium-2507\n    pixtral-large-2411\n\nNote: `devstral-small-2507` and `devstral-medium-2507` are in this pool. `devstral-2512` is a separate pool (see Pool 7).\n\n---\n\n**Pool 2: mistral-large-2411** (special)\n\nLimits: 600,000 tokens/5-min | 60 req/min | 200,000,000,000 tokens/month\n\n    mistral-large-2411   (no aliases; completely isolated from mistral-large-2512)\n\n> Note: This is the only model with a **5‑minute** token window.

The beauty of this, is that you can ask multiple questions in one message and it still counts as 1. So, the limit isn´t how many letters or words, the limit is the amount of messages. ",

My experience:\n\n\\+ I like the user interface; it works smoothly.\n\n− When I want to compare own code with a trusted (Jupyter-like) notebook, it either replaces the entire notebook or keeps the notebook in its original state. This happens repeatedly.\n\n− While the Quickstart can be found [here](https://docs.mistral.ai/mistral-vibe/introduction/quickstart), detailed set-up info can be found in the [README](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe/blob/main/README.md). I find that a bit unclear; wouldn't the documentation website be a better fit?\n\n− I was negatively surprised when Vibe/devstral-2 tried the following: \\`git reset HEAD\\`, thereafter commenting that the command was not very helpful. Surely, a development model should know better than that?!\n\n\n\nThe way things look right now, I think I would be better off using Codestral suggestions, and skipping the agentic factor. I already expected that working with agents would require some getting used to however, and I'm willing to try some more. Does anybody have recommendations for working with Vibe?",

I also try to avoid to saturate or compress the context if I can, even if it usually handles that fairly well.\n\nMy main complaint about vibe itself is that it tends to be sluggish after a while and usually takes forever to restore a session.\n\nI personally like how devstral works the tasks, it keeps it short and to the point, sometimes to a fault and I wish it would go a bit further or be more proactive but on the other hand that does leave me more control so it's a trade-off that I can accept.",

Caching the input tokens would reduce the latency and the costs. \n\nFor the reference:\n https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/prompt-caching/\n\nhttps://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching\n\n\nIs something like that planned for Mistral API? Can it be considered? \n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n",
