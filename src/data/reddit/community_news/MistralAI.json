A proper websearch sub-agent with actual query capabilities would let it find relevant sources first, then fetch.\n\n\n- Smarter plan mode — Better guidelines in system prompt, auto-clear stale context once a plan is approved, so execution starts with a clean, focused window.",

Lot of tokens are lost reverting changes that don't exit.\n\n\\- The model makes a plan for its first goal, then mostly leave it unchanged for the whole session, whatever there is a drift in objectives.\n\n\\- The model doesn't know what [AGENTS.md](http://AGENTS.md) is and make fun hallucinations when been asked to write one.\n\n\n\nActual requests:\n\n\\- Vibe could automatically propose to add an [AGENTS.md](http://AGENTS.md) file when missing in a new project.\n\n\\- For heavy refactoring, like adding a parameter to a method, the model only edit change sites once by once, which is very long.

If the team would rather I didn't share, happy to take it down.*\n\n\n\nThere's a hidden `/teleport` command that packages your entire Vibe session and sends it to something called \"Mistral Nuage.\" The config points to a staging domain, and the TODOs in the code say things like \"remove once the feature is publicly available.\" So it's not ready yet, but it's coming.\n\n\n\nThe part that got me interested is a fully implemented but commented-out method called `create_le_chat_thread()`. Rather than landing on some internal console, your teleported session would open as a Le Chat conversation with a cloud sandbox attached to your repo. So basically, \n\n\n**Vibe is coming to Le Chat**.\n\n\n\nRight now Vibe is terminal-only. What Mistral is building is a web coding agent inside Le Chat, backed by cloud environments that can clone your repos and apply your local changes. You'll be able to start a task in your terminal and pick it up in the browser, or the other way around, without losing any context. The upcoming underlying platform, Mistral Nuage, handles all of it: spinning up environments, running workflows, managing the back and forth. It's a new product entirely.\n\n\n\nLe Chat already has MCP connectors, so it can interact with external services. But it still needs you in the loop, watching it, prompting it. What Nuage would change is that Le Chat could go off on its own. Spin up a sandbox, clone your repo, work through a task, push code, all without you sitting there. It goes from an assistant that can use tools when you ask, to an agent that can take a job and run with it in the background, having automated daily routines, pre-programmed tasks, auto-trigger (receiving an email etc.). It basically shifts the paradigm from synchronous to asynchronous (= Le Chat can work when you sleep aha).  And the workflow system seems rather generic, GitHub is just the first connector. There's room for email, project management, CI, whatever.\n\n\n\nEverything on the Vibe side looks done and well-tested, so they're probably finalizing the infrastructure and the web interface. Wouldn't be surprised to see this in the next few weeks.",

This is why they are selling generic API keys or products, since these can scale quickly to tens of billions. \n\nHowever, many businesses are not looking for the best model, but rather the best integration with their data, privacy, sometimes requiring fine-tuning and custom solutions. This is very demanding in terms of human resources, as it means dealing with customers one-by-one and sending engineers to design their specific solutions. This is why big US companies avoid this, therefore Mistral is in a blue ocean by pursuing it. For sure, this business will not scale to $100B in revenue within three years (which is what the US companies want), but it can become a successful multi-billion dollar business and once a client has a deep integration, the churn rate will be very low, even if the model is slightly behind the current SOTA.",

I liked the agent and library options, and of course, the UI, which is genuinely well designed. I noticed along the way that it’s not on par with ChatGPT when it comes to generating images, videos, or live AI conversations, and that my native language (Serbian) is significantly less well adapted. However, on the other hand, I appreciated the agent options, the library, and the flexibility of customization and optimization. For my use cases where I use AI 80% of the time for interpreting and organizing emails, translating texts from one language to another, web searches, and similar tasks I realized that for a much more affordable price, I could get a similar experience to ChatGPT for my needs.\n\nYesterday, I decided to pay for the annual Pro subscription and cancel my ChatGPT subscription.\n\nToday, I already feel like I made a mistake and regret that decision.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nIntelligence (Beta): In my humble opinion, it doesn’t even deserve to be called an Alpha version.\n\n1. Memories: Simply put, they don’t work. I’ve tried everything adding my own memories in English, in Serbian, letting Le Chat add them based on our conversations and nothing. In every new chat, it’s as if it doesn’t take a single memory into account.\n\nExample: As a joke today, I tried that challenge where people mocked ChatGPT for giving the wrong answer to the question, \"If I need to wash my car and the car wash is 200 meters away, should I go by car or on foot?\" ChatGPT always said to go on foot, while Claude gave the correct answer that you have to go by car because it understood the context. I tried it in Le Chat, and of course, it failed just like ChatGPT did, even after multiple attempts and using thinking mode.\n\nThis isn’t even my biggest problem, although one of the first memories I set was that Le Chat should always think carefully and verify all circumstances and sources before giving an answer, as accuracy takes priority over speed. I also specified that it should always respond to me in the same language I write in (Serbian) during casual communication and never use em dashes. The result? Out of 10 new chats where I asked the same question about the car and the car wash, I got 10 wrong answers, mixed with Serbian and Croatian, and responses full of em dashes. Because of my frustrated replies, Le Chat kept adding new memories that it should never use Croatian words or em dashes (there are now about five memories for each issue), and yet, in every new conversation, it keeps making the same mistakes it doesn’t understand the context, mixes languages, and uses em dashes.\n\n2. Connectors: Currently, only Gmail has any value for my use case, but unfortunately, it doesn’t work well. It can’t search through email threads, suggest a recipient’s email in drafts even though it’s in the emails, or directly create a template that can be automatically forwarded to Gmail.\n\n3. Libraries: On the surface, this seems like a very useful feature that could replace NotebookLM for me, but it’s often ignored in responses. The agent quickly scans the library and gives a quick answer without tying the context of the question to the library or finding relevant connections.\n\n4. Instructions: I’ve already mentioned how memories are simply bypassed in most cases, and the same goes for the instructions I set at the very beginning. As I also said, one of the first instructions was that it should always take the time to analyze the question and provide the most accurate answer, no matter how long it takes. Yet, I keep getting hasty and incorrect responses.\n\nExample: I asked for the average price of a specific car model in Serbia, and it kept giving me a price that was double the actual amount. I kept challenging it, knowing it was wrong not by 1,000 euros, but instead of around 6,000 euros, it kept giving me a figure of 12,000 euros, without ever providing a concrete link or links where it found those prices. After about 10 exchanges, it still couldn’t give me a single link, it just kept hallucinating and making up numbers. Then I sent it a link I found for such a car priced at around 6,000 euros, and it replied that the link didn’t show the price or mileage (even though everything was clearly visible on the link).\n\nAll of this tells me that Mistral’s Le Chat project is primarily focused on providing a good interface for developers and coding, where things are fairly clear and logical, and response speed is most valued. Unfortunately, this severely undermines the versatility that Le Chat promotes, because in the pursuit of speed, it completely disregards all instructions and tools from Intelligence.\n\nAs a result, we have an effectively unfinished and unreliable product that’s very difficult to rely on for daily needs, especially since the AI is marketed and promoted as something that can replace all everyday operations but clearly, it’s not adapted for that.\n\nI sincerely hope someone from the Mistral team sees this post and responds by enabling Le Chat to process and respect instructions from Intelligence. If necessary, there should be a switch or option to directly instruct the AI to always strictly follow instructions and go through memories, even if it means slower response generation.\n\nOtherwise, this will forever remain a project that will never come close to the big competitors from the US and China.",

Creating different agents is literally like talking to different personalities, you can tell it's Mistral only for it's warm, friendly and almost emphatic tone, which none of the other AI have.\n\nThe memories works wonders for us, it's able to connect the dots between different things of the past and even take initiative in the convos based on them. It has now a lot of memories that go back 6 months and I can really really say that it knows me quite well.\n\nThe libraries are also rock solid, I have a bunch of documents that I want it to use as knowledge base in a specific agent, it never failed once so far.\n\nLeChat itself got a lot of improvement lately, for instance it double check what it's saying searching the web and when sometimes gets it wrong it immediately apologize and tries to correct itself.\n\nI would in fact say that it's greatest strength are the tone, the instructions following, the memories and the fact that is not full of propaganda.\n\nIt still got a lot to improve for sure, but it's a great platform that can only get better, in my experience.\n\nIf LeChat doesn't work in your specific language, maybe say that next time. Saying nothing works is just wrong and bad feedback. Imo.",

Is it on par with Gemini? \n\nI am grateful for your perspectives and insights! ",

The more complex the prompt and content the less capable Mistral is to do it all at once. If you do one API call for side characters, one for the main character, one for a suggestion of story progression and one to stitch it all together, then you'll have a much better result. The same goes for memories. \n\nIt's generally hard to tell you what you could improve about memories as you are not really explaining what technically happens, how you process memories, what you expect to happen versus what happens, etc",

Some people complain that it is a bit verbose, but I dont find it that chatty.\n\nI start with creating a context folder and ask devstral to create an outline for te project, and organise it in a way it finds logical, it makes some assumptions, so i do it in plan mode and update when i agree. After that i start asking it to make a plan and where it thinks it should start and just let it start generating code there. I only steer it when the overall achitecture stops making sense and let it refactor.\n\nSo far so good",
