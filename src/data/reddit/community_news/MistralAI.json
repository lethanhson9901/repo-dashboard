I have to be more methodical and break it up into smaller steps. A lot of people would get annoyed by that but it gives me intentionality and helps me understand the code it generates better.\n\nSo in the end my advice is to get to know it and see how much works it takes to get the same level of satisfaction with your statue and lighthouse images and then decide if it's the kind of LLM you want to hang out with.",

Some suggestions were \n\n\"[...]\nWhat did I eat today? (Especially: lentil dishes?😊)\n[...]\n\n🌿 Lentil check (if applicable)\n- which lentil dishes did I try today and how did it taste?\n- new recipes I tried \n\n[...]\n\n\n\nIs that okay with you? I can add more specific prompts on nutrition (lentils!), sports, or creativity! 😊\"\n\n\nSorry but that's just a bit too blatant and in your face even though I like lentils 😂  any way to reduce that without making it demented or deleting this one specific memory?",

      "text": "Salut la communauté,\n\nJe viens ici pour avoir des retours d’expérience honnêtes de personnes qui ont migré (ou envisagent de migrer) vers Mistral et l’écosystème tech européen.\n\nMon contexte actuel\n\nJe suis complètement dépendant de l’écosystème tech américain :\n\nIA :\n\n\\- ChatGPT Plus\n\n\\- Claude Pro (que j’utilise énormément pour mon boulot)\n\n\\- Gemini Pro en complément\n\nDonnées et productivité :\n\n\\- Gmail pour tout (perso + pro)\n\n\\- Google Drive avec 2 To de données\n\n\\- Écosystème Apple complet\n\nMon profil :\n\nEnseignant en informatique/cybersécurité. J’utilise l’IA quotidiennement pour générer des séquences pédagogiques, des TPs, des évaluations.\n\nBref, je suis exactement le type d’utilisateur qui a TOUT à perdre en migrant : confort, performances, intégration, habitudes de travail rodées.\n\nCe qui me fait poser la question\n\nLa crise du Groenland en cours.\n\nPour ceux qui ne suivent pas : Trump menace militairement le Danemark (membre fondateur de l’OTAN) pour annexer le Groenland. La Maison Blanche dit ouvertement que “l’option militaire est sur la table”. La France, l’Allemagne, la Suède et la Norvège viennent de lancer une mission militaire d’urgence au Groenland.\n\nC’est du jamais vu : un membre de l’OTAN menacé militairement par… un autre membre de l’OTAN.\n\nEt là, ça m’a fait réfléchir :\n\nQu’est-ce qui garantit que les US ne coupent pas l’accès à leurs services tech du jour au lendemain en cas de vrai clash géopolitique ?\n\nOn a déjà vu le précédent avec Huawei : du jour au lendemain, Google a coupé l’accès à Android/Play Store pour raisons géopolitiques. Si ça arrive entre l’Europe et les US :\n\n\\- Mes 2 To de données sur Drive ? Bloqués.\n\n\\- Mes mails perso/pro sur Gmail ? Inaccessibles.\n\n\\- ChatGPT/Claude pour mon boulot ? Coupés.\n\n\\- Tous mes cours, mes TPs, mes évaluations ? Perdus ou inaccessibles.\n\n\\-----\n\nLes alternatives que j’envisage\n\nIA :\n\n\\- Mistral Large/Pro : j’ai déjà testé, c’est clairement moins performant que ChatGPT \n\n ou Claude/Gemini sur des tâches complexes. Les réponses sont parfois moins fines, moins contextuelles. MAIS c’est souverain et ça progresse vite.\n\nDonnées/productivité :\n\n\\- Proton (Suisse) : Mail, Drive, Pass, Calendar, VPN\n\n\\- Possibilité de garder Gmail en alias le temps de la transition\n\nCloud/hébergement :\n\n\\- OVH pour l’hébergement si besoin\n\n\\-----\n\nMes questions concrètes pour ceux qui ont migré\n\n1. Performance IA :\n\n\\- Comment vous gérez la baisse de qualité des réponses Mistral vs ChatGPT/Claude ?\n\n\\- Pour quels usages Mistral est vraiment au niveau ? Pour lesquels c’est trop juste ?\n\n\\- Vous gardez un abonnement US “de secours” ou vous êtes 100% Mistral ?\n\n2. Migration des données :\n\n\\- Combien de temps ça vous a pris de migrer vos données de Google vers Proton ?\n\n\\- Des galères particulières ? Des trucs qui ne migrent pas bien ?\n\n\\- Comment vous gérez la transition (double usage, coupure nette) ?\n\n3. Workflow quotidien :\n\n\\- Honnêtement, vous avez perdu combien en productivité/confort au début ?\n\n\\- Après quelques mois, vous le regrettez ou c’est transparent maintenant ?\n\n\\- Des fonctionnalités Google/ChatGPT qui vous manquent vraiment ?\n\n4. Aspect pro :\n\n\\- Pour ceux qui utilisent l’IA en contexte professionnel, Mistral tient la route ?\n\n\\- Vous avez dû adapter vos prompts/workflows ?\n\n5.

Ainsi qu'un client mobile. Le cloud est utilisé avec NextCloud, sur ordi et mobiles. Ce cloud est bien moins performant que mon Dropbox, cependant il marche bien pour une utilisation perso, voire est plus simple pour certains usages qui pourraient t'intéresser, comme le partage gratuit de documents, là où Dropbox oblige tout le monde à se limiter à qq Gigas en gratuit.  \nPour Mistral, c'est un peu moins performant que GPT (et encore) et davantage que Claude. Cependant, le décalage est de 6 mois. Et cela me suffit dans 80% des cas. Je fais essentiellement de la documentation romanesque, de la rédaction web touristique et un peu de technique web et seo. Pour certaines tâches pointues, comme le codage d'API entre Wordpress et DRM, je croise avec GPT. Pour la vérification historique et factuelle d'articles de blogs, je croise avec Claude. J'emploie aussi un peu en plus NotebookLM pour travailler sur des sources qualifiées.  \nJe m'installe aussi progressivement sur Mastodon, mais là, la messe est dite pour l'instant, tout le monde est sur les RS américains, tant que nous ne serons pas au pied du mur.  \nDonc, je pourrais être relativement indépendant... si toutefois mes mac, pc, et iPad continuaient de fonctionner...",

Certes, rapport qualité/prix, Mistral est très bon, les quota de Claude s'épuisent très vite. Mais c'est dur de se départir de l'impression quand tu fais une tâche que \"Claude aurait mieux fait\".

Pas de Vivaldi pour moi, il mange trop de ram...\n\n  \nPour l'IA, c'est plus difficile. Je n'arrive pas à remplacer Claude pour mon usage personnel + le code, et je n'arrive pas à remplacer Gemini pour mes workflows n8n & appels API car je fais beaucoup appel à sa fenêtre de contexte très large.\n\nNéanmoins, je suis en cours de refonte de mes workflows et je m'aperçois que Mistral est adapté pour 90 % des étapes de mon travail... donc grosso modo je pense aboutir à une situation où ça sera du claude en api pour 1 m tokens, claude web, claude code, et mistral dans 90 % de mes appels API.\n\n  \nEt à coté : Graphene OS bientôt",

A bit weird, I thought, but a nice touch.\n\n  \nJust now, I followed up with a \"Yes\" to its suggested follow up and apart from complying, it randomly generated and added a picture completely unrelated to anything in that particular chat, but clearly based on a memory it has of me, saying \"And because you love \\[x\\], here’s a \\[y\\]:\"\n\nAmusing surprise, but surely this is a complete waste of resources and limits?

      "text": "Dear people, \n\nI have a 4090 gpu and 24gb vram. I have some models installed already but I would like other people's opinion on the best models. I have tried:\n\n1. Devstral 2 Small 24b (pretty good, one of the best)  \n2. Qwen3 Coder 30B A3b Instruct 1M (this one is my favourite, has 1M context windows and top model from qwen)  \n3. GLM 4.6V Flash (This one is so lazy, you need to force it to do code, it reasons a lot)\n\n4. Deepseek Coder V2 (I tried two versions of them but these are even lazier than glm. ) \n\nI still can't find the good model. I used these models to create a fine-tuning dataset (so not really coding but I do need jsonl format). I do not know if this testing is a good test for these models but I would really like a local model that would work with things like Kilo Code or Roo Code or Blackbox extensions in VS Code.\n\n  \nIf you have some favourites please drop them down below:) Thanks!",

Did anyone else have to wait this long, or did you get approved right away? Not sure if I did something wrong or if I just need to wait more.\n\nThanks in advance.",
