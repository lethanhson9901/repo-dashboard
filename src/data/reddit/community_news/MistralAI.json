      "text": "I’m sharing my thoughts and an initiative here—I hope it doesn’t come across as spam, but I’d love to spark a discussion.\n\nI often hear that Europe is hopelessly behind in AI (and not just in AI, by the way). While it’s undeniable that there’s a gap, Mistral’s Devstral 2 model scores 72.2 on SWE-Bench verified, matching the performance of Claude Opus 4, which was released 7 months earlier.\n\nWe could argue that Mistral is only 7 months behind, despite:\n\n* Budgets **tens of times smaller**. **Mistral has raised about $3B, while OpenAI has $58B, Anthropic $37B,** Meta plans to spend $115B in 2026 alone, and xAI secured $5B just as seed funding.\n* No access to massive data centers and higher European energy costs.\n* Limited data compared to Google and others.\n\nSeven months is nothing, and coding performance is one of the best predictors of future success.\n\nAssuming the main issue is capital, how can we attract it? I’ve thought about this and believe this proposal is feasible:\n\n* Create a large government fund, similar to Norway’s pension fund, with **voluntary participation from European and non-European countries**.\n* With a modest investment (<0.5% of GDP), **we could unlock €100-300B**—a huge sum compared to current European investments.\n* The fund would invest in local innovative AI companies, support a CERN for AI, build data centers (e.g., in Norway or Canada, where energy is cheap), and fund future technologies like robotics.\n* By leveraging private investments, which would surely follow, we could reach even higher figures.\n\nWhat do you think? I’m interested in your opinions.\n\nIn my view, the benefits would be enormous:\n\n* Competitive European AI on par with the US and China.\n* Partial public control over a technology that could become dangerous.\n* Wealth creation here.\n\nAll this at a manageable initial cost, shared among many countries, and likely to pay off in the coming years with potentially massive returns.\n\nMini-spam: Since talking is good but action is better, some friends and I have created [a petition](http://openpetition.eu/!swjml) and [a website](https://ai-movement.org/) to push this project forward. If you’re interested, I’d be thrilled, but either way, I hope this sparks a meaningful discussion.\n\n[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1qs3bbw)",

          "text": "I would mostly agree with some exceptions.\n\nI believe the gap is mostly cultural more than technological, we have extraordinary talents but the corporate business mindset is slowing everything down. They hold all the capital and have very low tolerance to risk and too long term cycles. Things have been slowly improving for the last 10 years but it's not even remotely at the pace everyone else is.\nIf you feel tech hubs like Berlin, Paris, Amsterdam they have very little to envy to others except for access to VCs.\n\nI don't want to be negative with your initiative but it's very highly unlikely that a sovereign fund or crowd capital is going to make any difference at scale (it can still get results but things don't snowball here), they move too slow and the tolerance for risk is too low.\n\nThat being said, Mistral IS competitive in the AI landscape, and IS spearheading it. Their tech is amazing across the board and they have key advantages that others cannot reach. There are other entities (that I can't name without doxxing myself too much) in the EU that are rock solid as well. \n\nSo I wouldn't talk in terms of hypotheticals. \n\nI would say let's keep running, we can already breath on their necks (otherwise we wouldn't see so much FUD spreading posts in here).",

Do you think we have a better chance?\n\nI also think public investment like these can easily repay the investment itself: if you consider a conservative private investment of the same order that will follow a public one and consider taxes + VAT you probably already almost repay the investment without even considering returns.\n\n",

When scale is the most important differentiator, Europe and Mistral can only be competitive if they start investing as much as US/China. That said, there is a place for Mistral as the top European AI company, even if it is not SOTA, and Europe can dominate on other fronts (like research but also regulations, yes it will be important to have solid regulatory framework for AI).",

And unless we want them to go balls to the wall on cost savings and replace white collar workers (and blue collar workers when the AI finally have physical bodies) then we should try to find alternative use-cases as examples.\n\nWe can let agents handle simple and tedious tasks and probably save some manhours but those junior tasks are what builds up the next generation of workers so…\n\nAnyway the genie is out of the bottle so we can only adapt and run as fast as we can.

      "text": "People often talk about chatbots only for niche or irrelevant everyday applications. I think Le Chat is one of the best tools for leveraging a virtual assistant, especially when using agents specialized in specific tasks.\n\nI’ve created dozens of agents that have replaced many of the apps I used before. For example\n\n* I have one that searches Wikipedia to ensure answers are accurate. I provide context to Le Chat, and it does the work autonomously.\n* Another agent updates me on daily news by searching the web directly.\n* An agent that acts as an organizer: it creates to-do lists where I can add or mark tasks as completed. I even add photos, handwritten notes, maps etc..\n* Another agent serves as a translator from Italian (my language) but unlike Google Translate, it maintains the conversation context. I can write a sentence in Italian, and it translates it into English without adding introductory or concluding phrases. Plus, I can ask it to rephrase the sentence in a more formal or informal tone, leveraging the capabilities of an advanced language model.\n* Another agent I developed manages my diet. I uploaded the meal plan provided by my nutritionist (I used Mistral’s Document AI to extract data from the PDF, which worked perfectly), and the agent generates meals that respect the specified calories and nutritional composition.\n* Finally, I use agents for gaming too. I play *Caves of Qud*, a roguelike where the story is procedurally generated and dialogue and descriptions are key to the fun. Since the game is in English and contains complex terms, I use a specially configured agent to:\n   * translate screenshots\n   * keep track of the game’s lore\n   * write a progress diary to remember what I’ve done\n   * memorize the characters I’ve met (the game is vast and changes with every playthrough).\n\nOpening a chat with a preconfigured agent is much faster and simpler than launching an app. IMHO for these quick, everyday tasks, Mistral is a step ahead of the competition.",

My mom is reading books with it.\n\nI tried all the other big ones, before getting them a subscription, and they are a total disaster, they radically change the structure of the text and tone, the rithm, they are basically useless. Chatgpt and Gemini are the worst in this, it looks like that every time they have to insert their point of view in the translation, ruining the original expressions.\n\nIt really shows that Mistral is made to work with different languages and that the others are solely focused on English or Chinese and on specific biases.",

Mistral falls on its face every so often, but in others it does better than ChatGPT and Grok.\n\nThis is based on my personal experience, as quite a heavy user of ChatGPT (until the very end of December) Grok and Mistral. Benchmarks are neat, but they're not reflective of end user experience:\n\nOn the domain of literature, it's largely a question of taste. It lands in the ballpark of 4o there for me, on fact finding, DeepResearch exceeds that of current ChatGPT (well, tested in december when I still were subscriped to ChatGPT, but assume it still holds).\n\nWhen it comes to straight up reasoning though, it's usually slightly above 4o, but handily beaten by ChatGPT5-series models, and usually Grok as well. When it fails though... when it fails it's ugly.\n\nAt least it fails so hard that it's hard to take seriously, making it really easy for the user to flag it as bad info.\n\nThis was kinda what put me off, alongside the short context window they had back then, in like Jan 2025, when I first tried it, when that failure mode was more the norm than the exception.\n\nThat experience put me off the whole thing like the plague, but coming back when OpenAI lost their mind, I found it immensely improved, and the creative model is in fistfights with Grok-4.1 and ChatGPT5-series models, occasionally exceeding.\n\nI would say, Mistral is lagging sligthly against the infinity money black hole models, but it's more sustainable, and keeps improving over time, making it a legitimate player in the field.\n\nYou can get the latest and greatest, along with the US soft colonialism, if you want with the US models, or you can hang back a spell over in Mistral, for a lower price and a more trustworthy creator.\n\nThe latter has increasingly become very important for me at least. Moreso than LLM raw strength.\n\n(also, doesn't hurt that there's a open model that I can run at home as well, just in case)",

Musk's Grok was notorious for having a relatively low price per token, but it uses absurd amount of tokens on reasoning (tokens that Grok, unlike most other LLMs, never sends to you), making it one of the most expensive models on the market. Qwen 3 suffered from similar issues. And... so does Mistral Large.\n\nSee https://artificialanalysis.ai/#cost - switch to Intelligence vs cost, enable all the latest models from Mistral AI and you will see that compared to the rest of the market - Mistral AI is one of the least cost-effective providers. Devstral2 might be the first model that breaks that pattern, but so far its real-world performance has been mixed bag, and it's clearly below Sonnet 4.5.\n\nEspecially when you have GLM-4.7 that actually DOES offer you Sonnet 4.5 performance at a lower cost. Heck: GLM 4.7 is cheaper than Devstral2! ([$0.4/$1.9](https://openrouter.ai/z-ai/glm-4.7?sort=price) vs [$0.4/$2.0](https://openrouter.ai/mistralai/devstral-2512?sort=price), and with GLM you can have it even cheaper thanks to caching ($0.08), something Devstral2 does not offer).\n\n(If you want to know more about cost efficiency, you can start with [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRWLQGMGY80), it's fairly accessible and a decent starting point)",

Chat GPT made regular mistakes on the interpretation of the Greeks because an Option with Expiry date 30/09/2026 was classified as a LEAP with an expiry date in 2027. I asked it twice to review its analysis and twice it supported the wrong thing. I then asked it to count from January to September and tell me how are these 400 and something days? It then said, you are right and stated that based on the fact that between January and September we have x days, my analysis on Delta, Implied volatility is incorrect and this is a crap deal. So reading the fine print showed me that it was Hallucinating for some reason. \n\n2. Grok: much better answer and better refinement by also providing hedging bets to cover potential losses arising from the trade. Chat GPT needed to be asked additional questions for this. Also Grok said that this trade is rather neutral and i should buy the equity rather than go into options i am a fan of slow and steady growth. This was nice to see however I was expecting more math and tangible evidence for the recommendation. \n\n  \n3. Le Chat - Mistral : straight and to the point but was more conservative than both Chat GPT and Grok. It made sure to avoid absolutes in its statements and simply kept to the surface by theorising. I had to press it hard to give me more criteria to take decisions and this was adequate, however I was still expecting a more comprehensive and mathematical analysis as to why it was basing its decision on so and so. \n\n  \nI guess we are not there yet for this type of scenarios.",

Here’s what happened:\n\n\n1. **Misinterpretation of Dates**: I mistakenly treated \"February 2026 to July 2026\" as an 18-month span instead of **6 months**. This was an error in basic arithmetic and attention to detail.\n2. **Overlooked Context**: I didn’t double-check the timeline against your long-term horizon (20+ years), which should have signaled that a 6-month DCA was a short-term tactic within your broader strategy.\n\n\n### **How I’ll Improve**\n- **Verify Dates**: Always cross-check timeframes with a calendar or simple math (e.g., February to July = 6 months).\n(...) \n\n\nSigh... ",

Reasoning is terrible and i very often have bugs in every session. I stillw ant to like lechat, but its harder and harder imo when at the same time using the other 3 named ones.

(yes, I did the testing).\n* Image generation is kinda mid.

Especially if you need it to access a file, you need to very EXPLICITLY tell it to do so.   \nThis is very different from CGPT which feels like it is swimming in the provided documents and accesses them too eagerly at times.\n\nOverall, I am very happy with it.",

I think this makes it ideal for defense and companies that need to keep secrets (ASML is a big investor, I guess no wonder?).\n\nI fear this leaves no compute room for, and less incentive to, produce great large competitive models for le chat, which I guess does not provide any revenue and might cost money…\n\nBut I still hope I am wrong, and they pivot to make a great le chat model that is competitive!! 🤷‍♂️ \nI do think their latest (non-thinking) option in le chat is pretty decent in understanding?

If you're looking for something that handles multi-file edits without the manual context-switching hassle, the Zencoder IDE Plugin is worth checking out since it does multi-repo indexing with automated validation built in. I've seen good results from people using it for those kinds of workflows where you need the AI to stay coherent across differnet files.",

I guess a better official integration will come sooner or later, but feel free to use it as an interim :)",

It has drawbacks.\n\n\\> Then it seemed it actually got that part right - nice. 2 messages later and everything was one big mixup again.\n\nChatbot's perfs (abilities to follow instruction) degrade as the discussion keep on going. When it makes a mistake, it has difficulties to ignore the error even if you corrected it and it told you \"got it! I made a mistake\". The reason why is that an LLM like Mistral as no \"mind state\" beyond what's written in the discussion. It has no inner voice. Its \"decisions\" are fully based on the past text. So when this past text is spoiled with bad ideas, it snowballs in even more stupidity in the following discussion. That's the same thing that when you says \"don't do that\" and it makes the chatbot doing it even more.\n\n\\> What the fuck am I doing wrong?\n\nFor complex task, you have to do \"context engineering\", that is producing the best prompt with related documents to your problem. You missed something or the model got it wrong? Rule Number 1: \\*Start a new session\\* with a fixed prompt where things are clearer. Rule Number 2: \\*Don't Don't\\* Formulate your needs without telling what the model mustn't do as it makes thing worse. Rule Number 3: \\*Garbage In / Garbage Out\\* Try filtering the input to focus on your current concern. Rule Number 4: \\*Don't plan immediatly\". Force Mitral to read the document by asking it to summarize them (if the summary is fake, there is an issue with your config and the documents are not here). Only after Mistral has read everything which matters, introduce it to your problem.\n\nThere are so many quirks, I can't tell all. For example, if it can't access a document you mention and you chat with Mistral like it has to know it, it may likely hallucinate details by switching into a kind of role-playing mode.",

          "text": "I know many people are bashing Mistral for not being the European equivalent of something like Claude or ChatGPT, but it seems to me that Mistral is aware they don't have the resources to compete at that level and they are trying to be competitive in other ways.\n\nI am using Mistral in parallel with Claude, Gemini and ChatGPT and I would say the following things are really standing out for me with Mistral:\n\n- Very competitive pricing, both for Le Chat and the API. I've been using Le Chat Pro heavily and I haven't had any issues with hitting limits, the same with the API (I am using Mistral Vibe for several projects, Document OCR and Mistral Large 3). For roughly 20 euros per month you get access to a lot of models and possibilities to experiment without going bankrupt.\n\n- Document OCR is really, really good. I was surprised how well it extracts text not following a specific format, identifies tables, forms, images and it does all that super fast. Like, I extracted all content from 3-4 PDFs that were overall around 600 pages in maybe 3-4 minutes. \n\n- Mistral Vibe and Codestral. Super fast and you can really do your job with them. I've added Codestral for autocomplete in my IDE and I love it. I know some people will complain that you can't do things with Vibe like prompting it \"make me a complete web app that does X\" and compare it to something like Claude Code where it can go on for days and build the whole damn thing without you having to touch a line of code; I think both are tools that can be very useful if you know when to use them. I see Mistral Vibe as a solution when you have a good idea of how you want to implement something and you can provide fairly detailed instructions, like \"implement a class having this structure and including the following methods accepting the following parameters\". In such cases it does a good job and also, in being so fast, I noticed I really like the feedback cycle in which I provide instructions, Mistral executes, I have a look at what it's done and run the code and check that it works as expected. \n\n- The language models are not as limited by the thought police and don't freak out if you mention something \"sensitive\". I discovered Gemini deleted entire conversations because it deemed some topics were \"not acceptable\", meanwhile almost everything flies with Mistral as long as it is not something straight out illegal or at least very questionable.\n\nAlso, as a final word, I really appreciate Mistral's initiative to try and find niches in which it performs really well instead of trying to compete head on with the big players. It also seems like it tries to grow in a sustainable way, which I think will be important in the future once the AI bubble starts to show signs of cracking.",

Voice chat works very well, and adapts to different languages very well.\n\n\\- OCR services (like reading text from a photo) are very good.\n\n\\- The small models are competitive, and speak a large variety of languages well.\n\n\\- Coding and tool use is competitive.\n\n\\- Price/performance. Fast because small. And looking at the burn rates of AI companies it is more likely to remain close to this price point in the future, because it appears to be more sustainable. As a developer that makes me trust investment in Mistral models more. Nothing worse than building your tools on top of a huge model, and then being confronted by a ten times price hike or the models dumbing down arbitrarily to cut spending.\n\n\\- A more European style of communication and more focus on Europe. TBF in my experience you should avoid topics like US politics though. It's not good at that, and easily hallucinates.\n\n\\- Complies with the privacy-by-design principles of the GDPR. That makes it a good B2B offering in Europe. Trying to bring OpenAI, Anthropic, or xAI in is hopeless. No customer shares confidential info with these companies.\n\n\\- Automoderation doesn't get in the way too often.\n\n\\- Not owned by lunatics who are out to destroy the world as we now it.",
