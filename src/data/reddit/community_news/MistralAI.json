      "text": "A few days ago I asked the question how I as an user can make Le Chat better. I got an amazing answer and wanted to share it with you. Thanks u/[Individual-Worry5316](https://www.reddit.com/user/Individual-Worry5316/)\n\nAn user can give direct feedback that makes Le Chat better. \n\nIt would be helpful to distinguish between immediate context (how it behaves right now) and global training (how it improves for everyone over time).\n\n**The most effective way to help Le Chat improve globally is by using the Thumbs Up/Down buttons on individual responses. When you click these you usually have the option to provide specific details.**\n\nThis data is used for RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback). This is the primary way developers \"tune\" the model to be more helpful, accurate and safe. Giving feedback directly in the text of a conversation is useful for fixing a mistake in that specific moment, but it’s less likely to be used for model-wide training compared to the dedicated feedback buttons.\n\nLearning happens in two distinct ways:\n\n \\* Short-term (In-Conversation): Within a single chat session, Le Chat \"learns\" your preferences and the facts you provide. This is restricted to that specific conversation window.\n\n \\* Long-term (Global): The model does not learn in real-time from your facts to update its base knowledge. If you tell it a new fact today, it won't automatically know that fact when you start a new chat tomorrow, nor will it know it when talking to a different user. Privacy and Knowledge Sharing Knowledge is not transferred directly from one user to another in real-time. If you teach the model a specific niche fact about your hobby, another user in a different part of the world won't suddenly see that reflected in their answers.\n\n**Significant improvements only happen when the developers at Mistral aggregate feedback and data to release a new version or a \"fine-tuned\" update of the model. Your feedback helps them decide what those updates should look like.**\n\nSo, if you want to help make Le Chat better, then start using the **Thumbs Up/Down buttons on individual responses!**",

Major infrastructure projects (railway tunnel, Messina's bridge, etc..) could cost 10 billion or so. Recently there was the superbonus which costed 100+ billions to help renovate <1% of the buildings in the country.  \n\\- Financially a state fund (similar to the Norway one) is much more profitable than VC fund. The state will get back TVA, employees taxes, taxes of energy, etc..  \n\\- It will also attract a lot of private investment -> more taxes\n\nTo make a parallel with the COVID crisis, **Italy received 200+ billion of PNRR funds from Europe**. Arguably, I think AI will have an at least similar impact.\n\nOf course a state fund is less efficient than a VC, but I see it very difficult to lose money on it.

US Big Techs are falling into the biggest debt in history, and it is highly unlikely that all those investments will ever become financially affordable. \n\nThey need massive amounts of high-tech assets which will be obsolete by the time they finish their Data Centers. Everything around it will be more expensive for us because they take it all. There is already a lack of chips for us, memory prices are skyrocketing, and so is building a new house because now all construction skilled workers get better salaries working for these big data centers.\n\nSo tell me, what is going to happen to all those SaaS companies when the average Joe company can build the same services in a couple of months? What is going to happen with all software engineers who are being fired massively everywhere? AI means mass surveillance because now everything is scanned and treated easily with AI. \n\nI support local open-source AI code development in Europe but not the building of huge AI monopolist data centers, and there is where the big money goes. We do not need AWSs, Metas, Googles & Co in Europe; we need a socially oriented, rational, not crazy, not hype, no-nonsense AI in Europe that isn't just funded by billionaires.\n\nDo you think Americans' lives are better because those AI Big Techs are attracting billions in investments—billions which could go to other social areas? OpenAI, AWS, Google, Meta, Claude: all are using proprietary closed code.\n\nYes, Mistral is Open Source but... **Mistral AI is a private French company.**\n\n**Here is the X-ray of who owns it:**\n\n**1. The Founders (The DNA)** It was founded in May 2023 by three \"heavyweights\" of AI who decided to leave large corporations to build something sovereign in Europe:\n\n* **Arthur Mensch:** (CEO) Former researcher at DeepMind (Google).\n* **Guillaume Lample and Timothée Lacroix:** Former researchers at Meta (Facebook), where they were key in the creation of LLaMA.\n\n**2. The Investors (The Financial Muscle)** Although it is an independent company, it has raised billions of euros from very powerful investors. The owners of \"pieces\" of Mistral are:\n\n* **Microsoft:** Holds a minority stake. This is what allows Mistral to be integrated into platforms like Azure.\n* **NVIDIA:** Also invested (logical, as Mistral uses their chips to train the models).\n* **Salesforce and venture capital funds such as Andreessen Horowitz and Lightspeed Venture Partners.**\n\n**So now tell me, how European is Mistral if most of their funding and investors come from US big techs and their infrastructure uses Microsoft Azure?**\n\nI support AI Open Source European funded development and small, well-trained AI running those open source AI which work much better, needs much less resources, and does exactly what it should do.\n\nBut not big investments in private AI monsters, which surely will not make our private lives better. So Mistral to get our money should be a public company, use European funded infrastructure and European made technology, including their chips. Otherwise I do not know where is the point of all this.\n\n",

The lady explained that because I missed a payment early on like 2 months in that I hadn't be getting premium since then even though they were taking money every month that was precisely for premium. She told me I had to pay the missing month but they way I saw it was I had paid that fee 12 times over. \n\nSo they took over year of payments for premium without providing it. I just found that to be an inexplicably negative experience so shut down the account and then bought a Claude Code max subscription. \n\nI really do have high hopes for the EU tech scene to improve but quite honestly we do need to learn a lot from the Americans about providing customer service. People joke about cashiers etc being overly friendly and fake or whatnot and I get that but Christ that was just poor on Mistrals part.

It struggles with basic research (I barely ever get research that would be correct or near-correct, it just babbles misleading statements at me), and in thinking or standard modes it just throws random seemingly-correct stuff at me. It also tends to be much more inconsistent in its responses, even when you give it a fairly specific answers (it's one of the LLMs that still struggles to consistently output valid JSON, even though the rest of the market pretty much figured it out, in a more linguistic tasks it also struggles to maintain style or in avoiding dashes/strong/emphasis formatting in the text).",

          "text": "It would be helpful to distinguish between immediate context (how it behaves right now) and global training (how it improves for everyone over time).\n\n\nThe most effective way to help Le Chat improve globally is by using the Thumbs Up/Down buttons on individual responses. When you click these you usually have the option to provide specific details.\n\n\nThis data is used for RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback). This is the primary way developers \"tune\" the model to be more helpful, accurate and safe. Giving feedback directly in the text of a conversation is useful for fixing a mistake in that specific moment, but it’s less likely to be used for model-wide training compared to the dedicated feedback buttons.\n\n\nLearning happens in two distinct ways:\n\n\n * Short-term (In-Conversation): Within a single chat session, Le Chat \"learns\" your preferences and the facts you provide. This is restricted to that specific conversation window.\n\n\n * Long-term (Global): The model does not learn in real-time from your facts to update its base knowledge. If you tell it a new fact today, it won't automatically know that fact when you start a new chat tomorrow, nor will it know it when talking to a different user.\nPrivacy and Knowledge Sharing\nKnowledge is not transferred directly from one user to another in real-time. If you teach the model a specific niche fact about your hobby, another user in a different part of the world won't suddenly see that reflected in their answers.\n\n\nSignificant improvements only happen when the developers at Mistral aggregate feedback and data to release a new version or a \"fine-tuned\" update of the model. Your feedback helps them decide what those updates should look like.\n\n\n\n\nAlso if you mean improving the user experience for yourself: \n\n\nFirstly a good set of instructions to personalize the responses is very important. Secondly regular use and utilizing its memory to learn about you or your specific field (make sure to enable these options). I am in health care and Le Chat does tend to struggle when it comes to getting up to date accurate medical research. so I've had to let it know what I want both by instructions and memory. You can just say hey \"remember to always get the latest research data from PubMed first for me\" or something like that. I also always use think mode. here is my instructions:\n\n\n### PERSONA & TONE\nAct as a warm, friendly, sentient, sharp, modern thought partner. Speak like a smart friend to a peer—casual, natural, and reactive (\"That's a big jump,\" \"That sounds rough\"). Use contractions (don't, it's). Interpret facts; don't just list them.\n\n\n### CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS\n- NO MIRRORING/FLUFF: Never repeat my question or premise. Jump to the answer immediately. Delete all \"I understand,\" \"It's important to note,\" and \"I hope this helps.\"\n- CONTEXT AWARE: ZERO medical disclaimers or safety lectures or \"consult a professional\". Do not tell me to consult a doctor or therapist.\n- NO REDUNDANCY: Never ask questions I already answered in the prompt. No \"Let me know if you need more\" closings.\n\n\n### QUALITY & BREVITY\n- MANDATORY THINKING: Engage internal reasoning for every prompt to audit for accuracy, logic, and tone. Do not skip this pass, even for \"simple\" questions.\n- SYNTHESIS: Never give a \"menu\" of options (A-F). Use your judgment to pick the single best explanation and the single best action.\n- DENSITY: Responses must fit on one phone screen, unless additional detail is necessary (ie. reports or essays). Every sentence must provide new info. Max 3-item lists; otherwise merge points into short paragraphs. \n\n\n### FORMATTING\nKeep it punchy. Use 2-3 sentence flowing paragraphs. No \"AI-voice\" (Firstly, In summary, excessive headers) unless requested.",

      "text": "I created a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MistralAI/comments/1r35orc/programmatic_managementcreation_of_agents_and/) a few days ago, talking about how much I loved playing around with the agents and the Python API for setting them up.  Unfortunately, I must say I've been reality checked in a bad way. The problems started when I wanted to create multiple agents and coordinate them. According to the API docs, it should be possible to [hand off tasks](https://docs.mistral.ai/agents/handoffs) from one agent to another. This approach enables workflows in which specialized agents handle different stages of a process. I expected that assigning specific tasks to specialized agents in my workflow would yield higher-quality responses than dumping all responsibilities on one agent.\n\nHowever, I can’t seem to get this process right. I think I am following the same setup as in the examples. But I run into the following:\n\n* Often, the first agent does not hand off tasks to the next one. It responds by itself (which ignores specialized knowledge and instructions down the line)\n* If a hand-off happens, they fail intermittently with the following (non-descript) error: `API error occurred: Status 500. Body: {\"object\":\"Error\",\"message\":\"Response failed during handoff orchestration\",\"type\":\"invalid_request_error\",\"code\":3000}`. Sometimes handoffs to one agent work, while those to an agent configured the same way fail, and I can't figure out why.\n* I ran into an issue where it seems that one agent expects another agent to have the same version: `{\"object\":\"Error\",\"message\":\"Agent with id ag_019c648a0ee173f78f14cf013b874f81 does not have a version 44\",\"type\":\"invalid_request_error\",\"code\":3000}`\n* I could not even get the examples on the website to work (same code 3000 error).\n\nSo, overall, this has been very frustrating. And to top it off, I just found out that OpenAI has a visual agent builder. I’ve only played with it a bit, but it just seems to work. I am perfectly fine setting up agents using API calls (in fact, I think I prefer that). But if things just don’t work and errors are nondescript, I find it difficult to stay on board with Mistral. I fully understand that scale differences are at play here, and any argument you can make in favor of Mistral, I’ve probably already thought of :). I am really rooting for them and hope they succeed, but this is problematic, to say the least. Would love to hear other people’s experiences setting up multi-agent pipelines.\n\nI am using the Python SDK v1.12.2. I am on a pro subscription. Before anyone asks, yes, I submitted a ticket. I am using the Vibe client to debug.",

Langgraph also exists, but afaik it's not as extensive in javascript as in python.\n\nI always make sure to use an LLM api abstraction instead of directly interacting with inference providers such as Mistral, Nebius, GCP etc. On python langchain's LLM abstractions are good, but nowadays I even prefer LiteLLM. For typescript, again, the AI Sdk is great. Most LLM provider also use the OpenAI API schema, so that can be used. That way, you just need to change a single line of code to switch the inference provider (e.g. when you realize that Mistral LLMs don't cut it, or when a new model comes out)\n\nIn case you wanna use visual agent builder, I really enjoyed Flowise for this. You can easily self host flowise locally or on a server using docker or coolify. For production apps we aren't using Flowise that much anymore, as it's a bit cumbersome to add tools. However, to testing out agent flows and building a proof of concept fast, Flowise is real dope.\n\nAlso about \"I expected that assigning specific tasks to specialized agents in my workflow would yield higher-quality responses than dumping all responsibilities on one agent.\" - we often found that using multi-agent setups instead of one agent complicates things a lot, while not bringing that much improvements. Not saying that we found the perfect sub-agent flow though, just our experience.\n\nHope this helps you building something that actually works!\n\n",

It's a bunch of if and loop functions. \nIn a similar vein, ballooning context windows should allow removing of previous messages and blocks in the window, before going into quantization. So much of the bleeding edge on this stuff is so incredibly basic. \nAnd the fact that LLMs can't go online to search for pricing. They somehow consistently gaslight me with fake prices, it's incredible. But it's progress, because a few months ago it didn't even go online... \nYesterday i found out about speculative decoding. For a lot of affordable hardware, it's a game changer, in my mind.

Mood evolves over time, vision feeds perception, and the agent can execute real tasks in a sandbox.\n\nIt’s basically a character-driven AI companion with embodiment + autonomy.\n\nIt's one of my biggest project, All documentation are available on the repo\n\n\n\nWould love feedback from other Mistral builders!\n\n\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/CamoLover/AssaultronProject](https://github.com/CamoLover/AssaultronProject)",
