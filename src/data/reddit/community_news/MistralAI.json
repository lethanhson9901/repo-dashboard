      "text": "Due to my work, I'm currently in Dubai. \n\nYesterday, starting around 3:00 PM, missile and drone attacks began. Most were intercepted, but several caused damage and injuries from falling debris and burning fragments. I'm here with my pregnant wife, and with the airspace closed, we don't yet know when we’ll be able to leave.\n\nI mention this for context. Spending the night listening to explosions does something to your thinking. It sharpens certain concerns, I suppose.\n\nAt the same time all this was happening, I learned that OpenAI had formalized the integration of its models into the so-called “Department of War,” and later I saw the statement from Sam Altman in the screenshot. The combination was… clarifying.\n\nIn situations like the one I'm living, you start to see very clearly who controls the infrastructure you depend on, who they answer to, and who they don’t. And I personally cannot continue funding a company that openly accepts surveillance of foreign users and deep military integration.\n\nThis is my conclusion: we need genuinely independent, democratic, and sovereign AI. Europe needs it. The world needs it. And right now, Mistral is the only major player aiming in that direction in the field of European AI.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5dw97xexdemg1.jpg?width=601&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d00768e0c2d6dd3c0ee79ea0e3d8330bda38ab7\n\nThat’s all I wanted to say.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wxpiop1bdemg1.jpg?width=1320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=844095a1c093193289134caa0df117a6c23c4358\n\n  \n",

For more than a year I have urged them to accelerate their digital sovereignty programs. \n\nEven the sovereign cloud offerings from the American cloud providers are anything but. I will give you one practical example:\n\nMicrosoft in the recent days touted how their European sovereign cloud has independent control plane. But this is just marketing. All it would take for White House to apply leverage is to define zero day patches on national security export block list, and all of the non-US regions would be vulnerable. \n\nThis is just one example. \n\nIn practice, without continuous service and operations from the US, European cloud regions can continue operating roughly 72 hours until service degradation starts to become obvious. \n\nThe AI is an increasingly complex topic as well. Just try to discuss Californian election results with American LLM and you can see what I mean. \n\nAnd all of the above are increasingly pressured to hand over user information to the alarmingly extrajudicial American federal agencies operating under administrative order, instead of rule of law. \n\nWe are in peril. And most of us don’t understand it.",

I wanted to make European LLMs actually usable, not just something that looks good on paper.\n\nRight now, working with European models often means extra steps compared to U.S. providers. That can make things a bit more expensive and a bit more complex, but in my experience the difference is still somewhat manageable.\n\nThe bigger challenge is keeping up. Models like Mistral are not improving fast enough, they’re still behind the U.S. and Chinese alternatives. We’ve  been able to some extent close part of that gap in our own service, but it’s important that the gap doesn’t keep growing. If it does, we’ll eventually have to look at other options",

But to answer your question: \n\nWith Mistral, you often have to spell things out. U.S. models are better at picking up what’s implied; the nuance, the assumptions, even a bit of sarcasm. Mistral usually doesn’t catch that unless you help it. \n\nI like to compare it to talking to a 12-year-old versus a 35-year-old. Same words, different level of understanding of what’s between the lines.\n\nWe work around this by adding structure and context, and that works pretty well. But understanding implicit meaning for a longer period of time (large context window) really matters with documents, and if that gap gets bigger, it’s hard to fully solve with engineering alone.",

I've run Mistral Large and the older Medium behind corporate firewalls and the inference cost per token is genuinely competitive once you factor in not paying the OpenAI tax on every API call at scale.\n\nThe real question is whether Accenture's army of consultants can actually fine-tune and deploy these models competently or if they'll just wrap the API in a chatbot and call it \"AI transformation.\" Based on what I've seen from Big Four/Five consulting engagements, it's usually the latter until the client pushes back.\n\nMistral's advantage here is the EU angle. Half of Accenture's enterprise clients in Europe won't touch US-hosted inference for regulated workloads. That alone justifies the deal regardless of benchmark numbers.",

      "text": "II figured I’d give Mistral Vibe a go this month instead of Claude Code. I checked their site to see if there were any indicators of how many tokens I could burn through before being shut off (like with Claude). At the time of signing up for Vibe, the site only mentioned “generous usage,” so I had no idea when I’d hit any kind of limit. I saw nothing else and went on my way. I used it for a couple of weeks on some projects I was working on and didn’t love it or hate it. I was at dinner when I suddenly got an invoice for $280. I logged into the site and there is now a monthly usage tracker with “Pay as you go” set by default and, as far as I can tell, no way to turn it off. Safe to say I will not be using Mistral Vibe again. I guess this is more a PSA than anything, so check your Vibe usage.\n\nEdit: Because I should have mentioned it. Current Le Chat Pro subscriber.  \nEdit2: Even more wild I had thought something like this could happen, so I even capped my API usage at $20. I submitted a ticket with Mistral, will update.\n\n  \nUpdate 1: Someone from the Mistral team reached out and I emailed with them. I was told, “we have updated clearer usage monitoring in your Vibe page, and we will refund everyone impacted this month while this tracking was not in place.” I genuinely appreciate how quickly they resolved this, and I will update again when I see the chargeback hit my card.",

The support lady said once an early payment was missed there was an outstanding balance. So even though all the next 11 transactions went through Mistral didn't provide premium that entire time. That's not how these things work, you either cut the service if there is an outstanding balance and stop taking money or continue to provide it while taking money. You don't get to take money and not provide the premium service I was paying for citing a missed transaction a year before.\n\nI was simply naive trying to support a nascent EU tech scene but you guys simply ripped me off. I will never be giving you money again and now I give Claude 100 Euro a month now.\n\nI'm so infuriated with you guys. I can explain that behavior. Greed.",

Vibe has its own key, and through their newly implemented (and never announced) tracker, it shows that I went over the limit and was switched to pay-as-you-go at some point. I have no idea when, as I never received any notification that pay-as-you-go had become the policy, nor that it couldn’t be turned off. The only API tracker visible on the page was one I’d set to a $20 per month maximum, and it still shows $0 in usage. I understand that the tracker probably applies to other API keys, but when I first set up Vibe, it was the only area on the entire page that had any form of API tracker or a way to set a usage limit, and it still is. \n\nHere is the newly implemented Vibe tracker. It does not even show how many tokens I have used on pay-as-you-go. It feels like they decided to start charging people before they actually rolled out the most important features: a way to set limits, turn it off, and a way to see what you have spent.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k8tswfvec0mg1.png?width=1142&format=png&auto=webp&s=06d0cd9b902c32219a102315ae3314ff5ad9179c\n\n",

They could ship it tomorrow with a search API integration but seem to be prioritizing the API/enterprise side over consumer chat features.\n\nHonest take: Mistral Large 2 is genuinely competitive on structured tasks like code generation and function calling. Where it falls apart is open-ended reasoning and instruction following across long conversations. If you're using Le Chat as a general assistant replacement, yeah, it's going to feel worse. If you're hitting it through the API with well-scoped single-turn prompts, the gap narrows significantly.",

                  "text": "Well, I asked Lechat for you: \n\n  \nGetting the best answers from me (or any AI assistant) is all about clarity, context, and structure. Here are some practical tips to help you—and your users—prompt effectively:\n\n1. Be Specific and Direct\n\nWhy: Vague questions lead to vague answers.\n\nHow:\n\nInstead of: \"Tell me about AI.\"\n\nTry: \"What are the main differences between generative AI and predictive AI, with examples?\"\n\n\n\n2. Provide Context\n\nWhy: More context = more relevant answers.\n\nHow:\n\nInstead of: \"How do I fix this code?\"\n\nTry: \"Here’s my Python code for a data analysis task. It’s giving me a KeyError when I run it on this dataset. Can you help me debug it? \\[Paste code/dataset\\].\"\n\n\n\n3. Break Down Complex Questions\n\nWhy: Multi-part questions can be overwhelming.\n\nHow:\n\nInstead of: \"Explain quantum computing and its impact on cybersecurity and also how it works.\"\n\nTry:\n\n\"What is quantum computing in simple terms?\"\n\n\"How could quantum computing affect cybersecurity?\"\n\n\"Can you explain how a quantum computer works?\"\n\n\n\n4. Specify the Format\n\nWhy: I can adapt my output to your needs.\n\nHow:\n\n\"List the top 5 AI trends in 2026 as bullet points.\"\n\n\"Explain blockchain to a 10-year-old in 3 sentences.\"\n\n\"Write a Python function to sort a list, and include comments for each step.\"\n\n\n\n5. Ask for Sources or Examples\n\nWhy: It helps verify information and makes answers more practical.\n\nHow:\n\n\"What are the best practices for remote team management? Include real-world examples from tech companies.\"\n\n\"Can you summarize the latest research on AI ethics and cite the sources?\"\n\n\n\n6. Use Step-by-Step Instructions\n\nWhy: Great for tutorials, troubleshooting, or learning.\n\nHow:\n\n\"Walk me through setting up a local development environment for a React app, step by step.\"\n\n\"How do I train a simple machine learning model using Python? Include code snippets.\"\n\n\n\n7. Iterate and Refine\n\nWhy: Sometimes the first answer isn’t perfect—refining helps.\n\nHow:\n\nFollow up with: \"Can you simplify that?\", \"What about \\[specific aspect\\]?\", or \"Give me more details on \\[topic\\].\"\n\n\n\n8. Use Natural Language\n\nWhy: I’m designed to understand conversational language.\n\nHow:\n\n\"I’m planning a trip to Berlin. What are some must-see places for history buffs?\"\n\n\"I’m stuck on this math problem. Can you guide me through it?\"\n\n\n\n9. Ask for Opinions or Recommendations\n\nWhy: I can provide tailored suggestions.\n\nHow:\n\n\"What’s the best programming language for a beginner interested in web development?\"\n\n\"Recommend some productivity tools for remote teams.\"\n\n\n\n10. Experiment and Explore\n\nWhy: The more you interact, the better you’ll understand how to get the best results.\n\nHow:\n\nTry different phrasings, ask for analogies, or request creative outputs like poems, stories, or even code.\n\n\n\nExample Prompts for Le Chat\n\n\"Act as a career coach. I’m a software engineer with 5 years of experience. What skills should I learn next to advance to a senior role?\"\n\n\"Summarize the plot of 'Dune' in 100 words or less, and explain its main themes.\"\n\n\"Help me brainstorm 10 blog post ideas about sustainable living.\"\n\n\n\nFinal Tip: If you’re ever unsure how to phrase something, just ask me: \"How can I improve this prompt to get a better answer?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n",

Le Chat doesn't always make it obvious which model is handling your query, and the routing logic has its own opinions about what deserves the heavyweight model.\n\nIf you actually want to evaluate Mistral fairly, hit the API directly with Mistral Large Latest. Set your system prompt explicitly, manage your own context window. I ran it against internal benchmarks for structured extraction tasks last year and it held up within 3-5% of GPT-4.1 on schema-conformant output while costing roughly 40% less per million tokens.\n\nThe chat product and the models are two different conversations. Most of the frustration people report is with the former, not the latter.",

          "text": "Honest move, but the real takeaway here is that usage tracking for AI coding assistants is a genuinely hard infrastructure problem. You're metering token consumption across streaming connections, tool calls, retries, and context window resets — none of which map cleanly to traditional API billing. Most providers get this wrong initially because the billing surface area for agentic workloads is at the core, different from chat completions.\n\nThe fact they're splitting tracking between admin.mistral.ai and console.mistral.ai for PAYG vs Pro already hints at two separate metering pipelines, which is probably where the discrepancy originated tbh. Worth watching whether the fix actually reconciles both or just patches the PAYG side. Unified observability across billing tiers is where most platforms quietly accumulate debt.",

Example:  \n\n```\ncurl -si https://api.mistral.ai/v1/chat/completions \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $MISTRAL_API_KEY\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"model\":\"codestral-latest\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"hi\"}],\"max_tokens\":3}' \\\n  | grep -i \"x-ratelimit\\|HTTP/\"\n```\n\nHeaders show:\n- `x-ratelimit-limit-tokens-minute`\n- `x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens-minute`\n- `x-ratelimit-limit-tokens-month`\n- `x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens-month`\n\nThe model `mistral-large-2411` is the only one that has a bit different set of headers:\n- `x-ratelimit-limit-tokens-5-minute`\n- `x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens-5-minute`\n- `x-ratelimit-limit-tokens-month`\n- `x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens-month`\n- `x-ratelimit-tokens-query-cost`\n- `x-ratelimit-limit-req-minute`\n- `x-ratelimit-remaining-req-minute`\n\n\n---\n\n## Quota Pools\n\nQuota limits are not per-model — they are shared across groups of models.

With over 4,000 employees and eight years of experience since its founding in December 2015, the company has resources and expertise that Mistral AI, as a young startup, is still building. Nevertheless, Mistral AI—founded only in April/May 2023 and currently employing around 250 people—has rapidly established itself as a strong, rising European alternative. For me personally, it was a deliberate decision to cancel ChatGPT and instead give Le Chat a chance. At a time when digital autonomy and privacy-compliant solutions are becoming more important than ever, it is crucial to support European projects like Mistral AI and thus create a counterbalance to the global tech giants.",

          "text": "If you do generative storytelling and worldbuilding for fun and some escapism, then I must say it does well, but not up to par with GPT-4o, speaking of creativity and tone. In a scale of 10, GPT-4o is easily around 9, and Le Chat is about 7. That is the overall experience.\n\nLe Chat has essentially zero stupid guardrails as those which ChatGPT are imposing on their users. I experimented with explicit and outright ridiculous contexts for testing, and Le Chat just complied, given the contexts are not harmful. It does have guardrails, but it doesn't treat you as a 12-year-old. ChatGPT Plus: 0, Le Chat Pro: 10.\n\nOne thing I'm not really happy about Le Chat is the accuracy when describing uploaded pictures. This is something it can improve more. If the images are clear, then it can describe easier. If the images are a bit ambiguous, but still somewhat clear to us human, then Le Chat struggles and is prone to making up non-existing details. ChatGPT Plus: 8, Le Chat Pro: 6.\n\n\"Project's chat as context\" is something I love about Le Chat. I don't have to ask the AI to generate a summary (which usually lacks details and/or contains a little hallucination) to upload to the project's library anymore, for the continuity of context between chats within a project. I unsubscribed from ChatGPT Plus since November 2025, so I don't know (and don't give a damn) about whether they already included it for ChatGPT Plus, so I cannot give a fair score comparison between those 2.\n\nSadly, when using AI for information and knowledge rambling, I still have to go back to ChatGPT (free). The accuracy and the overall tone of ChatGPT is still something Le Chat has to aim for. Since this is the free version of ChatGPT, again, I cannot give a fair score comparison.\n\nFinally, the price of Le Chat is more reasonable, while they provide more availability for users (larger library size, more files uploaded in a chat, near-infinite number of chats in a project, etc.). So, huge win for Le Chat in this. ChatGPT Plus: 6, Le Chat Pro: 10.\n\nSo for conclusion, Le Chat is a good alternative, with still something to be improved, if you are someone used to be happy with GPT-4o and are finding a similar experience.\n\nEdit: One more thing I forgot to mention. Again, this is for those who use AIs for recreational worldbuilding and generative storytelling. With ChatGPT in general, you can entrust it to be creative while holding itself back from inventing too many plot points, details, characters, without your permission. With Le Chat, you must do more \"hand-holding\" if your wish to see the same. Le Chat's instruction mechanism can and will sometimes feel less effective. You tell it to \"not invent major plots and characters\", and it might still do, something I never had any problem with in ChatGPT.",

I thought I was going to miss the Custom GPTs, but Projects actually work even better since you can personalize them in the same way, plus Claude can read across chats and act accordingly. As for the limits, yes, that's the only drawback, and I guess quality comes at a price - but if you learn how to use it rationally with projects and skills, don't put everything that comes to mind into Claude, and form your questions in a way that doesn't require further explanation, you can manage without hitting your limit.",

This happens repeatedly.\n\n− While the Quickstart can be found [here](https://docs.mistral.ai/mistral-vibe/introduction/quickstart), detailed set-up info can be found in the [README](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe/blob/main/README.md). I find that a bit unclear; wouldn't the documentation website be a better fit?\n\n− I was negatively surprised when Vibe/devstral-2 tried the following: \\`git reset HEAD\\`, thereafter commenting that the command was not very helpful. Surely, a development model should know better than that?!\n\n\n\nThe way things look right now, I think I would be better off using Codestral suggestions, and skipping the agentic factor. I already expected that working with agents would require some getting used to however, and I'm willing to try some more. Does anybody have recommendations for working with Vibe?",

I also try to avoid to saturate or compress the context if I can, even if it usually handles that fairly well.\n\nMy main complaint about vibe itself is that it tends to be sluggish after a while and usually takes forever to restore a session.\n\nI personally like how devstral works the tasks, it keeps it short and to the point, sometimes to a fault and I wish it would go a bit further or be more proactive but on the other hand that does leave me more control so it's a trade-off that I can accept.",

Unfortunately, Vibe isn't on the same level as the others, it constantly does things that I definitely didn't ask it to do or gets it wrong, even though other models seem to be perfectly fine with my instructions.",

Does it only increase usage in the le chat platform or does it increase usage in other ways too? I am interested in Codestral and using different Mistral models, but I am only familiar with Le Chat. I don't want to pay for use, but I could pay a monthly pro subscription if it gave me more usage on all the models and through all endpoints.\n\nSo essentially, what is the difference between having Le chat pro and the \"scale\" plan in AI studio? And what happens if I have le chat pro but the free experiment plan on AI studio? What even is AI studio, isn't it supposed to be la plateforme anyways?\n\nMistral's documentation is so hard to understand. I don't even know what I would be paying for",
