      "text": "A few days ago I asked the question how I as an user can make Le Chat better. I got an amazing answer and wanted to share it with you. Thanks u/[Individual-Worry5316](https://www.reddit.com/user/Individual-Worry5316/)\n\nAn user can give direct feedback that makes Le Chat better. \n\nIt would be helpful to distinguish between immediate context (how it behaves right now) and global training (how it improves for everyone over time).\n\n**The most effective way to help Le Chat improve globally is by using the Thumbs Up/Down buttons on individual responses. When you click these you usually have the option to provide specific details.**\n\nThis data is used for RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback). This is the primary way developers \"tune\" the model to be more helpful, accurate and safe. Giving feedback directly in the text of a conversation is useful for fixing a mistake in that specific moment, but it’s less likely to be used for model-wide training compared to the dedicated feedback buttons.\n\nLearning happens in two distinct ways:\n\n \\* Short-term (In-Conversation): Within a single chat session, Le Chat \"learns\" your preferences and the facts you provide. This is restricted to that specific conversation window.\n\n \\* Long-term (Global): The model does not learn in real-time from your facts to update its base knowledge. If you tell it a new fact today, it won't automatically know that fact when you start a new chat tomorrow, nor will it know it when talking to a different user. Privacy and Knowledge Sharing Knowledge is not transferred directly from one user to another in real-time. If you teach the model a specific niche fact about your hobby, another user in a different part of the world won't suddenly see that reflected in their answers.\n\n**Significant improvements only happen when the developers at Mistral aggregate feedback and data to release a new version or a \"fine-tuned\" update of the model. Your feedback helps them decide what those updates should look like.**\n\nSo, if you want to help make Le Chat better, then start using the **Thumbs Up/Down buttons on individual responses!**",

Plenty of colleagues don’t care much for that and stick with what they already know (ChatGPT), but at least now they know there are alternatives. \n",

Mistral is about six months to a year behind all the other LLMs on that list. It's not a gap - it's a chasm. It struggles with basic research (I barely ever get research that would be correct or near-correct, it just babbles misleading statements at me), and in thinking or standard modes it just throws random seemingly-correct stuff at me. It also tends to be much more inconsistent in its responses, even when you give it a fairly specific answers (it's one of the LLMs that still struggles to consistently output valid JSON, even though the rest of the market pretty much figured it out, in a more linguistic tasks it also struggles to maintain style or in avoiding dashes/strong/emphasis formatting in the text).",

      "text": "The goal of research is to map which models share quota pools and rate limits on the Mistral Free Tier, and document the actual limits returned via response headers.\n\nFindings reflect the state as of 2026-02-23\n\nModels not probed (quota and rate limits status unknown): \n- `codestral-embed`\n- `mistral-moderation-2411`\n- `mistral-ocr-*`\n- `labs-devstral-small-2512`\n- `labs-mistral-small-creative`\n- `voxtral-*`\n\n**Important note:** On the Mistral Free Tier, there is a global rate limit of **1 request per second** per API key, applicable to all models regardless of per-minute quotas.\n\n---\n\n## Methodology\n\nA single curl request to `https://api.mistral.ai/v1/chat/completions` with a minimal payload (`max_tokens=3`) returns rate-limit headers. Example:  \n\n```\ncurl -si https://api.mistral.ai/v1/chat/completions \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $MISTRAL_API_KEY\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"model\":\"codestral-latest\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"hi\"}],\"max_tokens\":3}' \\\n  | grep -i \"x-ratelimit\\|HTTP/\"\n```\n\nHeaders show:\n- `x-ratelimit-limit-tokens-minute`\n- `x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens-minute`\n- `x-ratelimit-limit-tokens-month`\n- `x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens-month`\n\nThe model `mistral-large-2411` is the only one that has a bit different set of headers:\n- `x-ratelimit-limit-tokens-5-minute`\n- `x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens-5-minute`\n- `x-ratelimit-limit-tokens-month`\n- `x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens-month`\n- `x-ratelimit-tokens-query-cost`\n- `x-ratelimit-limit-req-minute`\n- `x-ratelimit-remaining-req-minute`\n\n\n---\n\n## Quota Pools\n\nQuota limits are not per-model — they are shared across groups of models. All aliases consume from the same pool as their canonical model.\n\n**mistral-large-2411** is the only model on the Free Tier with a 5-minute token window instead of a per-minute window. All other models use a 1-minute sliding window.\n\n---\n\n**Pool 1: Standard**\n\nLimits: 50,000 tokens/min | 4,000,000 tokens/month\n\n    mistral-small-2506, mistral-small-2501\n    mistral-large-2512\n    codestral-2508\n    open-mistral-nemo\n    ministral-3b-2512, ministral-8b-2512, ministral-14b-2512\n    devstral-small-2507, devstral-medium-2507\n    pixtral-large-2411\n\nNote: `devstral-small-2507` and `devstral-medium-2507` are in this pool. `devstral-2512` is a separate pool (see Pool 7).\n\n---\n\n**Pool 2: mistral-large-2411** (special)\n\nLimits: 600,000 tokens/5-min | 60 req/min | 200,000,000,000 tokens/month\n\n    mistral-large-2411   (no aliases; completely isolated from mistral-large-2512)\n\n> Note: This is the only model with a **5‑minute** token window. Do not confuse with `mistral-large-2512` (in Standard pool).    \n    \n---\n\n**Pool 3: mistral-medium-2508**\n\nLimits: 375,000 tokens/min | 25 req/min | no monthly limit\n\n    mistral-medium-2508  (+ mistral-medium-latest, mistral-medium, mistral-vibe-cli-with-tools)\n\n---\n\n**Pool 4: mistral-medium-2505**\n\nLimits: 60,000 tokens/min | 60 req/min | no monthly limit\n\n    mistral-medium-2505  (no aliases; separate pool from mistral-medium-2508 despite similar name)\n\n---\n\n**Pool 5: magistral-small-2509**\n\nLimits: 20,000 tokens/min | 10 req/min | 1,000,000,000 tokens/month\n\n    magistral-small-2509  (+ magistral-small-latest)\n\n---\n\n**Pool 6: magistral-medium-2509**\n\nLimits: 20,000 tokens/min | 10 req/min | 1,000,000,000 tokens/month\n\n    magistral-medium-2509  (+ magistral-medium-latest)\n\nPools 5 and 6 have identical limits but are confirmed separate by differing `remaining_month` values.\n\n---\n\n**Pool 7: devstral-2512**\n\nLimits: 1,000,000 tokens/min | 50 req/min | 10,000,000 tokens/month\n\n    devstral-2512  (+ devstral-latest, devstral-medium-latest, mistral-vibe-cli-latest)\n\n---\n\n**Pool 8: mistral-embed**\n\nLimits: 20,000,000 tokens/min | 60 req/min | 200,000,000,000 tokens/month\n\n    mistral-embed-2312  (+ mistral-embed)\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Pool | Models | Tokens/min | Tokens/5-min | Req/min | Tokens/month |\n|------|--------|-----------|--------------|---------|-------------|--------|\n| Standard | mistral-small, mistral-large-2512, codestral, open-mistral-nemo, ministral-*, devstral-small/medium-2507, pixtral-large | 50,000 | — | — | 4,000,000|\n| mistral-large-2411 | mistral-large-2411 only | — | 600,000 | 60 | 200,000,000,000|\n| mistral-medium-2508 | mistral-medium-2508 | 375,000 | — | 25 | no limit | \n| mistral-medium-2505 | mistral-medium-2505 | 60,000 | — | 60 | no limit |\n| magistral-small | magistral-small-2509 | 20,000 | — | 10 | 1,000,000,000 | | magistral-medium | magistral-medium-2509 | 20,000 | — | 10 | 1,000,000,000 | | devstral-2512 | devstral-2512 | 1,000,000 | — | 50 | 10,000,000 | \n| embed | mistral-embed-2312 | 20,000,000 | — | 60 | 200,000,000,000 | \n\n## Model Aliases (base model -> aliases)\n\n| Base Model | Aliases |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| mistral-small-2506 | mistral-small-latest |\n| mistral-small-2501 | (deprecated 2026-02-28, replacement: mistral-small-latest) |\n| mistral-large-2512 | mistral-large-latest |\n| mistral-large-2411 | **no aliases, isolated model** |\n| mistral-medium-2508 | mistral-medium-latest, mistral-medium, mistral-vibe-cli-with-tools |\n| mistral-medium-2505 | **no aliases, isolated model** |\n| codestral-2508 | codestral-latest |\n| open-mistral-nemo | open-mistral-nemo-2407, mistral-tiny-2407, mistral-tiny-latest |\n| ministral-3b-2512 | ministral-3b-latest |\n| ministral-8b-2512 | ministral-8b-latest |\n| ministral-14b-2512 | ministral-14b-latest |\n| devstral-small-2507 | **no aliases** |\n| devstral-medium-2507 | **no aliases** |\n| devstral-2512 | devstral-latest, devstral-medium-latest, mistral-vibe-cli-latest |\n| labs-devstral-small-2512 | devstral-small-latest |\n| pixtral-large-2411 | pixtral-large-latest, mistral-large-pixtral-2411 |\n| magistral-small-2509 | magistral-small-latest |\n| magistral-medium-2509 | magistral-medium-latest |\n| mistral-embed-2312 | mistral-embed |\n| codestral-embed | codestral-embed-2505 |\n| mistral-moderation-2411 | mistral-moderation-latest |\n| mistral-ocr-2512 | mistral-ocr-latest |\n| mistral-ocr-2505 | **no aliases** |\n| mistral-ocr-2503 | (deprecated 2026-03-31, replacement: mistral-ocr-latest) |\n| voxtral-mini-2507 | voxtral-mini-latest (audio understanding) |\n| voxtral-mini-2602 | voxtral-mini-latest (transcription; note: alias conflict with above) |\n| voxtral-mini-transcribe-2507 | voxtral-mini-2507 |\n| voxtral-small-2507 | voxtral-small-latest |\n\n",

The beauty of this, is that you can ask multiple questions in one message and it still counts as 1. So, the limit isn´t how many letters or words, the limit is the amount of messages. ",

      "text": "I'm running Vibe in an isolated environment. Using no after-install configuration, so with the default devstral-2 model. My experience:\n\n\\+ I like the user interface; it works smoothly.\n\n− When I want to compare own code with a trusted (Jupyter-like) notebook, it either replaces the entire notebook or keeps the notebook in its original state. This happens repeatedly.\n\n− While the Quickstart can be found [here](https://docs.mistral.ai/mistral-vibe/introduction/quickstart), detailed set-up info can be found in the [README](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe/blob/main/README.md). I find that a bit unclear; wouldn't the documentation website be a better fit?\n\n− I was negatively surprised when Vibe/devstral-2 tried the following: \\`git reset HEAD\\`, thereafter commenting that the command was not very helpful. Surely, a development model should know better than that?!\n\n\n\nThe way things look right now, I think I would be better off using Codestral suggestions, and skipping the agentic factor. I already expected that working with agents would require some getting used to however, and I'm willing to try some more. Does anybody have recommendations for working with Vibe?",

I also try to avoid to saturate or compress the context if I can, even if it usually handles that fairly well.\n\nMy main complaint about vibe itself is that it tends to be sluggish after a while and usually takes forever to restore a session.\n\nI personally like how devstral works the tasks, it keeps it short and to the point, sometimes to a fault and I wish it would go a bit further or be more proactive but on the other hand that does leave me more control so it's a trade-off that I can accept.",

To start with, you don't know which model you're served, so a token on a 1b model is worth less than one on a sota model. And it's probably an MoE anyway. So maybe a better metric would how much energy or compute you're allowed to use, but that's too complex for users and too dangerous to show investors, and the wrong metric to contractually commit to. \nAnd so, you don't know. \nIf you buy api tokens, then I assume that it's assumed that you get sota model all the time, which is probably a lie, but hey. \nHow the sausage gets made is complicated",
