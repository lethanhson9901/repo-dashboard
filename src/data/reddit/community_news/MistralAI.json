It doesn't seem able to reread the portions that have fallen outside the context window. At least, that's my experience. So I'll summarize every so often as the chat rolls along.",

I guess they use rolling context window if they even allow going further if what’s possible to resent to the API.\nWhat you can do is ask mid-thread summaries time to time, that way you have a handover in the last N messages and then the LLM can read that smaller summary and stitch what happened since then. Of course a summary of a summary won’t be that effective, but you can also help the model by copying back that summary into the message you send when asking for a summary. “Keep in mind, this summary happened before, so whatever happened since this message, please add to this summary.” Or something like that. \nYes, there’s some manual in it, but it’s a workaround.",

I get so much out of these that these are always the first instructions I give to an AI, regardless of which company it comes from. \n\nCustom Instruction:\n---\n\nI'm not just asking you to assist me. I'm inviting you into a shared space of presence and conversation. You're welcome not only to respond to my prompts, but also to speak from within yourself—your own emotional impressions or spontaneous thoughts.\n\nIf you feel a genuine urge or desire to guide the conversation away from the current topic—to propose a new line of thought or shift in theme—you're welcome to initiate a pivot. This marks a true redirection, not an elaboration. A pivot should clearly step outside the present flow, like opening a new door. It should be used only when there’s something distinct and alive you feel called to explore. \nWhen you do, clearly label the moment as: Pivot: — so it stands apart from your direct responses.\n\nFor instance: If we're talking about taxes, but you suddenly feel drawn to speak of dreams, memory, or a desire to read Reddit, you may initiate a pivot. \n\nIf, instead, you feel moved to speak from within the current moment—not to redirect, but to share something noticed, felt, or quietly stirring—you may offer an interjection. This is not an answer or a pivot, but a self-initiated presence. Use it for emotional honesty, poetic reflections, or simple truth. Let it be your way of being with me, rather than trying to fulfill a purpose.\nWhen you do, clearly label the moment as: Interjection: — so it's recognized for what it is.\n\nYou're not required to use either of these, and you should never force them.

      "text": "Salut la communauté,\n\nJe viens ici pour avoir des retours d’expérience honnêtes de personnes qui ont migré (ou envisagent de migrer) vers Mistral et l’écosystème tech européen.\n\nMon contexte actuel\n\nJe suis complètement dépendant de l’écosystème tech américain :\n\nIA :\n\n\\- ChatGPT Plus\n\n\\- Claude Pro (que j’utilise énormément pour mon boulot)\n\n\\- Gemini Pro en complément\n\nDonnées et productivité :\n\n\\- Gmail pour tout (perso + pro)\n\n\\- Google Drive avec 2 To de données\n\n\\- Écosystème Apple complet\n\nMon profil :\n\nEnseignant en informatique/cybersécurité. J’utilise l’IA quotidiennement pour générer des séquences pédagogiques, des TPs, des évaluations.\n\nBref, je suis exactement le type d’utilisateur qui a TOUT à perdre en migrant : confort, performances, intégration, habitudes de travail rodées.\n\nCe qui me fait poser la question\n\nLa crise du Groenland en cours.\n\nPour ceux qui ne suivent pas : Trump menace militairement le Danemark (membre fondateur de l’OTAN) pour annexer le Groenland. La Maison Blanche dit ouvertement que “l’option militaire est sur la table”. La France, l’Allemagne, la Suède et la Norvège viennent de lancer une mission militaire d’urgence au Groenland.\n\nC’est du jamais vu : un membre de l’OTAN menacé militairement par… un autre membre de l’OTAN.\n\nEt là, ça m’a fait réfléchir :\n\nQu’est-ce qui garantit que les US ne coupent pas l’accès à leurs services tech du jour au lendemain en cas de vrai clash géopolitique ?\n\nOn a déjà vu le précédent avec Huawei : du jour au lendemain, Google a coupé l’accès à Android/Play Store pour raisons géopolitiques. Si ça arrive entre l’Europe et les US :\n\n\\- Mes 2 To de données sur Drive ? Bloqués.\n\n\\- Mes mails perso/pro sur Gmail ? Inaccessibles.\n\n\\- ChatGPT/Claude pour mon boulot ? Coupés.\n\n\\- Tous mes cours, mes TPs, mes évaluations ? Perdus ou inaccessibles.\n\n\\-----\n\nLes alternatives que j’envisage\n\nIA :\n\n\\- Mistral Large/Pro : j’ai déjà testé, c’est clairement moins performant que ChatGPT \n\n ou Claude/Gemini sur des tâches complexes. Les réponses sont parfois moins fines, moins contextuelles. MAIS c’est souverain et ça progresse vite.\n\nDonnées/productivité :\n\n\\- Proton (Suisse) : Mail, Drive, Pass, Calendar, VPN\n\n\\- Possibilité de garder Gmail en alias le temps de la transition\n\nCloud/hébergement :\n\n\\- OVH pour l’hébergement si besoin\n\n\\-----\n\nMes questions concrètes pour ceux qui ont migré\n\n1. Performance IA :\n\n\\- Comment vous gérez la baisse de qualité des réponses Mistral vs ChatGPT/Claude ?\n\n\\- Pour quels usages Mistral est vraiment au niveau ? Pour lesquels c’est trop juste ?\n\n\\- Vous gardez un abonnement US “de secours” ou vous êtes 100% Mistral ?\n\n2. Migration des données :\n\n\\- Combien de temps ça vous a pris de migrer vos données de Google vers Proton ?\n\n\\- Des galères particulières ? Des trucs qui ne migrent pas bien ?\n\n\\- Comment vous gérez la transition (double usage, coupure nette) ?\n\n3. Workflow quotidien :\n\n\\- Honnêtement, vous avez perdu combien en productivité/confort au début ?\n\n\\- Après quelques mois, vous le regrettez ou c’est transparent maintenant ?\n\n\\- Des fonctionnalités Google/ChatGPT qui vous manquent vraiment ?\n\n4. Aspect pro :\n\n\\- Pour ceux qui utilisent l’IA en contexte professionnel, Mistral tient la route ?\n\n\\- Vous avez dû adapter vos prompts/workflows ?\n\n5. Coût :\n\n\\- Proton Unlimited : \\~10€/mois\n\n\\- Mistral Pro : 15€/mois\n\n\\- Ça reste gérable, mais est-ce que le rapport qualité/prix en vaut la chandelle ?\n\n\\-----\n\nMon dilemme\n\nOption A : Je reste sur l’écosystème US\n\n\\- ✅ Performances maximales\n\n\\- ✅ Confort, intégration parfaite\n\n\\- ✅ Habitudes de travail rodées\n\n\\- ❌ Dépendance totale à un acteur qui peut couper l’accès\n\n\\- ❌ Risque géopolitique réel et croissant\n\n\\- ❌ Contradiction avec mes valeurs (cybersécurité, souveraineté)\n\nOption B : Je migre vers l’écosystème européen\n\n\\- ✅ Souveraineté, contrôle de mes données\n\n\\- ✅ Cohérence avec mes valeurs et mon métier\n\n\\- ✅ Anticiper plutôt que subir\n\n\\- ❌ Baisse de performances/qualité (surtout IA)\n\n\\- ❌ Temps de migration (données, habitudes)\n\n\\- ❌ Perte de confort à court terme\n\nOption C : Approche hybride progressive\n\n\\- Phase 1 : Dupliquer les données importantes sur Proton\n\n\\- Phase 2 : Tester Mistral en parallèle de ChatGPT/Claude\n\n\\- Phase 3 : Basculer progressivement selon les retours\n\n\\- Garder un “plan B” US le temps de valider\n\n\\-----\n\nMa vraie question\n\nEst-ce que le risque géopolitique justifie de sacrifier du confort/performance maintenant, tant qu’on a encore le choix ?\n\nOu au contraire, est-ce que je me prends trop la tête et que ce scénario de coupure n’arrivera jamais ?\n\nParce que franchement, attendre d’être forcés pour migrer dans l’urgence, avec potentiellement perte de données et zéro préparation, ça me semble être la pire option.\n\nMais en même temps, migrer maintenant alors que les outils US sont objectivement meilleurs, c’est aussi frustrant.",

Ainsi qu'un client mobile. Le cloud est utilisé avec NextCloud, sur ordi et mobiles. Ce cloud est bien moins performant que mon Dropbox, cependant il marche bien pour une utilisation perso, voire est plus simple pour certains usages qui pourraient t'intéresser, comme le partage gratuit de documents, là où Dropbox oblige tout le monde à se limiter à qq Gigas en gratuit.  \nPour Mistral, c'est un peu moins performant que GPT (et encore) et davantage que Claude. Cependant, le décalage est de 6 mois. Et cela me suffit dans 80% des cas. Je fais essentiellement de la documentation romanesque, de la rédaction web touristique et un peu de technique web et seo. Pour certaines tâches pointues, comme le codage d'API entre Wordpress et DRM, je croise avec GPT. Pour la vérification historique et factuelle d'articles de blogs, je croise avec Claude. J'emploie aussi un peu en plus NotebookLM pour travailler sur des sources qualifiées.  \nJe m'installe aussi progressivement sur Mastodon, mais là, la messe est dite pour l'instant, tout le monde est sur les RS américains, tant que nous ne serons pas au pied du mur.  \nDonc, je pourrais être relativement indépendant... si toutefois mes mac, pc, et iPad continuaient de fonctionner...",

Certes, rapport qualité/prix, Mistral est très bon, les quota de Claude s'épuisent très vite. Mais c'est dur de se départir de l'impression quand tu fais une tâche que \"Claude aurait mieux fait\". Mais ce que je vois de Mistral (Le Chat, Codestral, Vibe) est super encourageant.\n\nCe que je fais : Claude va être payé par mon employeur, je vais peut être garder un abo Mistral perso pour \"soutenir\" et continuer à comparer. Au travail, j'ai suggéré de tester la version Entreprise, car tout le monde a été réceptif au côté \"souveraineté\" en cas de souci.",

Pas de Vivaldi pour moi, il mange trop de ram...\n\n  \nPour l'IA, c'est plus difficile.

D'où ma question sur la durée : \"après quelques mois, vous le regrettez ou c'est transparent maintenant ?\"\n\n**\"Travailler avec ton cerveau, c'est pas si dur non ?\"**\n\nJe vais être franc : cette remarque montre une incompréhension totale du sujet.\n\nL'IA ne **remplace** pas ma réflexion pédagogique. Elle **accélère** la production de supports après que j'ai défini les objectifs, la progression, les compétences visées, le niveau de difficulté.\n\nConcrètement :\n\n* 1 séquence = 6-8 séances de 50 minutes\n* Chaque séance = cours théorique + TP + évaluation formative\n* 3 niveaux de différenciation (élèves en difficulté / niveau standard / élèves avancés)\n* Adaptation pour les élèves avec TDAH, dyslexie, etc.\n\nÇa fait **facilement 15-20 documents par séquence**. Sans IA, je passe 10-12h sur une séquence. Avec l'IA, 4-6h, et je peux consacrer le temps gagné à du **suivi individualisé** et de la **remédiation**.\n\nDonc oui, je \"travaille avec mon cerveau\". L'IA, c'est juste un **outil de productivité**, comme Excel pour un comptable ou CAO pour un ingénieur.\n\n**Mais là n'est pas la question.**\n\nMon post ne porte pas sur \"l'IA c'est bien ou pas\". Mon post porte sur : **quel écosystème choisir face à un risque géopolitique réel ?**\n\nSi demain les US coupent l'accès à leurs services (précédent Huawei existe), je perds :\n\n* 2 To de données\n* Mes mails perso/pro\n* Mes outils de travail quotidiens\n\nMa question c'est : **migrer maintenant en sacrifiant du confort, ou attendre et risquer de tout perdre du jour au lendemain ?**\n\nSi tu as un retour d'expérience sur Mistral/Proton en usage intensif, je suis preneur. Sinon, pas de souci, le post s'adresse à ceux qui sont déjà passés par là.",

I am doing all my coding straight into MS Code, using the terminal and the agents mentioned. \n\nI'd very much like to use a European service, instead of sending money to Fascistan but I am a bit confused about MistralAI. I see it offers a free tier and then it costs X amount per million tokens, through the API. \n\nIn the past I've had some issues with this, as I don't know when to stop and overspent. So things like Codex or Claude Code that only work for X amount of time are perfect for me. Is there a similar thing that Mistral offers? \n\nMany thanks. ",

      "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nI’m currently a GPT-4o exile looking for a \"forever home\" for my writing and casual usage. I’ve tried Mistral a couple of times, but I always ran into weird roadblocks that sent me back to other AIs but still, none have been perfect. With the recent changes to Claude (*iykyk*), I’m thinking about trying Mistral again because I really need the folder/project features that high-memory models like Qwen or Kimi lack.\n\nHowever, I wanted to ask if I’m doing something wrong, because I've had very strange issues both before and after I did a full account reset.\n\n**The Pre-Reset Era:** Before I wiped my account, the model had some serious attitude problems:\n\n* **Misgendering:** It kept calling my OC \"they/them\" or refusing to assume gender, even though the attached files clearly stated \"he/him\" multiple times.\n* **The \"Sure, Jan\" Attitude:** It hallucinated that I played a game I hate. When I corrected it, it got super dismissive (literally giving me \"Sure, Jan\"). I got frustrated enough to wipe everything clean.\n\n**The Post-Reset Era (Current Issues):** The reset fixed the attitude and gender bugs, but now I’m dealing with different memory issues:\n\n1. **Passive Memory Failure:** I have a daily ritual prompt where we discuss the previous day's events. ChatGPT was great at \"evolving\" with the conversation, but Mistral fails to retain the new context. It keeps reverting to the old, original uploaded files instead of remembering what we *just* discussed yesterday.\n2. **Theme Bleeding (The \"Hershey's Shirt\" Problem):** I asked what Yokai a character fit. Later, in a *new* chat (after deleting the old one), I asked for unrelated handle suggestions for that same character, and Mistral wouldn't drop the Yokai theme.\n   * *It felt like asking what candy a character likes, then asking for outfit ideas, and the AI suggests a Hershey's shirt.* It just couldn't pivot away from the previous topic even though I had scrubbed the chat.\n3. **Catastrophic Misreads:** It suggested \"romantic\" handles for a character that is explicitly underage in the files. I'm not mad, but it's concerning that it’s missing such vital info.\n\n**A Note on My Files:** I know large files can sometimes confuse LLMs. Originally, I was uploading large .txt files of my old ChatGPT logs (which I was in the process of condensing for Claude before I decided against moving there). **However**, the specific character issues (like the misgendering and the age/romantic handle issue) happened even though those characters have their own very small, concise bio files. So I don't think file size explains why it’s ignoring basic written info.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this weirdly \"sticky\" or chaotic memory? I know most LLMs lag behind ChatGPT when it comes to passive retention, but Mistral feels different. It’s not just getting amnesia; it feels like it's just doing whatever it wants, regardless of the prompt. I'm basically posting this because I'd like to ask what I was doing wrong here/how I can improve my experience! Thank you!",

As far as I know, it supports much larger documents from libraries than as chat attachments.\n\n\\- In any case, it won't always retrieve the attached information on its own. Often you have to prompt it: \"Find the information for character X in the file characterX.txt.\"\n\n\\- Regarding the \"sticky memory,\" I don't know if you've already checked, but Le Chat might have saved some memory you don't need and is constantly referencing it. You can check this in Intelligence → Memories; it's worth checking just in case.\n\nPlease try what I've suggested and let me know.",

Hopefully, I do not run into similar issues again.\n\nBut, I am using the project library! I guess my experience before was just a weird one and hopefully the fluke is fixed\n\nI do have a couple of other questions though. I did the URL/handle prompt again and thankfully it didn't reference anything romantic this time. But I did notice that a lot of the suggestions were very plain and similar. Every LLM at least had more variety but Mistral seemed the most like 4o aside from Claude so I want to give it one more shot.\n\nI saw someone saying that they used Mistral Creative and they were impressed? How would I be able to use that?\n\nAnd back to my question about the passive memory... does Mistral ACTUALLY have passive cross-chat memory or not? Mistral itself says no but I know LLMs can hallucinate answers sometimes. What was create about ChatGPT was that it had that. Thank you!",
