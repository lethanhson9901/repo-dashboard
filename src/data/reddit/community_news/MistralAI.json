      "text": "People often talk about chatbots only for niche or irrelevant everyday applications. I think Le Chat is one of the best tools for leveraging a virtual assistant, especially when using agents specialized in specific tasks.\n\nI’ve created dozens of agents that have replaced many of the apps I used before. For example\n\n* I have one that searches Wikipedia to ensure answers are accurate. I provide context to Le Chat, and it does the work autonomously.\n* Another agent updates me on daily news by searching the web directly.\n* An agent that acts as an organizer: it creates to-do lists where I can add or mark tasks as completed. I even add photos, handwritten notes, maps etc..\n* Another agent serves as a translator from Italian (my language) but unlike Google Translate, it maintains the conversation context. I can write a sentence in Italian, and it translates it into English without adding introductory or concluding phrases. Plus, I can ask it to rephrase the sentence in a more formal or informal tone, leveraging the capabilities of an advanced language model.\n* Another agent I developed manages my diet. I uploaded the meal plan provided by my nutritionist (I used Mistral’s Document AI to extract data from the PDF, which worked perfectly), and the agent generates meals that respect the specified calories and nutritional composition.\n* Finally, I use agents for gaming too. I play *Caves of Qud*, a roguelike where the story is procedurally generated and dialogue and descriptions are key to the fun. Since the game is in English and contains complex terms, I use a specially configured agent to:\n   * translate screenshots\n   * keep track of the game’s lore\n   * write a progress diary to remember what I’ve done\n   * memorize the characters I’ve met (the game is vast and changes with every playthrough).\n\nOpening a chat with a preconfigured agent is much faster and simpler than launching an app. IMHO for these quick, everyday tasks, Mistral is a step ahead of the competition.",

A proper websearch sub-agent with actual query capabilities would let it find relevant sources first, then fetch.\n\n\n- Smarter plan mode — Better guidelines in system prompt, auto-clear stale context once a plan is approved, so execution starts with a clean, focused window.",

I think this makes it ideal for defense and companies that need to keep secrets (ASML is a big investor, I guess no wonder?).\n\nI fear this leaves no compute room for, and less incentive to, produce great large competitive models for le chat, which I guess does not provide any revenue and might cost money…\n\nBut I still hope I am wrong, and they pivot to make a great le chat model that is competitive!! 🤷‍♂️ \nI do think their latest (non-thinking) option in le chat is pretty decent in understanding?

Other models might do just as well with the same tools. There was a learning curve for it as I took the time to make a custom response template and also set the parameters very tight. Temp is 0.1 for example.  I suggest that getting used to a model and adapting it to your system over time will help you significantly increase your performance and satisfaction. I use openwebui and self host the model with ollama. I will likely switch to vllm or llama.cpp to boost speed.",

Google, Anthropic, and OpenAI are looking for massive, scalable revenue to justify the investments they are making. This is why they are selling generic API keys or products, since these can scale quickly to tens of billions. \n\nHowever, many businesses are not looking for the best model, but rather the best integration with their data, privacy, sometimes requiring fine-tuning and custom solutions. This is very demanding in terms of human resources, as it means dealing with customers one-by-one and sending engineers to design their specific solutions. This is why big US companies avoid this, therefore Mistral is in a blue ocean by pursuing it. For sure, this business will not scale to $100B in revenue within three years (which is what the US companies want), but it can become a successful multi-billion dollar business and once a client has a deep integration, the churn rate will be very low, even if the model is slightly behind the current SOTA.",

I've been using Le Chat Pro heavily and I haven't had any issues with hitting limits, the same with the API (I am using Mistral Vibe for several projects, Document OCR and Mistral Large 3). For roughly 20 euros per month you get access to a lot of models and possibilities to experiment without going bankrupt.\n\n- Document OCR is really, really good. I was surprised how well it extracts text not following a specific format, identifies tables, forms, images and it does all that super fast. Like, I extracted all content from 3-4 PDFs that were overall around 600 pages in maybe 3-4 minutes. \n\n- Mistral Vibe and Codestral. Super fast and you can really do your job with them. I've added Codestral for autocomplete in my IDE and I love it. I know some people will complain that you can't do things with Vibe like prompting it \"make me a complete web app that does X\" and compare it to something like Claude Code where it can go on for days and build the whole damn thing without you having to touch a line of code; I think both are tools that can be very useful if you know when to use them. I see Mistral Vibe as a solution when you have a good idea of how you want to implement something and you can provide fairly detailed instructions, like \"implement a class having this structure and including the following methods accepting the following parameters\". In such cases it does a good job and also, in being so fast, I noticed I really like the feedback cycle in which I provide instructions, Mistral executes, I have a look at what it's done and run the code and check that it works as expected. \n\n- The language models are not as limited by the thought police and don't freak out if you mention something \"sensitive\". I discovered Gemini deleted entire conversations because it deemed some topics were \"not acceptable\", meanwhile almost everything flies with Mistral as long as it is not something straight out illegal or at least very questionable.\n\nAlso, as a final word, I really appreciate Mistral's initiative to try and find niches in which it performs really well instead of trying to compete head on with the big players. It also seems like it tries to grow in a sustainable way, which I think will be important in the future once the AI bubble starts to show signs of cracking.",

Fast because small. And looking at the burn rates of AI companies it is more likely to remain close to this price point in the future, because it appears to be more sustainable. As a developer that makes me trust investment in Mistral models more. Nothing worse than building your tools on top of a huge model, and then being confronted by a ten times price hike or the models dumbing down arbitrarily to cut spending.\n\n\\- A more European style of communication and more focus on Europe. TBF in my experience you should avoid topics like US politics though. It's not good at that, and easily hallucinates.\n\n\\- Complies with the privacy-by-design principles of the GDPR. That makes it a good B2B offering in Europe. Trying to bring OpenAI, Anthropic, or xAI in is hopeless. No customer shares confidential info with these companies.\n\n\\- Automoderation doesn't get in the way too often.\n\n\\- Not owned by lunatics who are out to destroy the world as we now it.",

For personal use I have a throw-away google account with Gemini Pro (one-off $7 for a year bought on Reddit :).\n\nFinding AI becoming a critical tool for me, I was considering getting a more permanent solution in place for personal use, and I really wanted Mistral to be the answer. I am Danish, but mostly use English to communicate at work and with the various AI chats. However, when discussing things that are naturally related to Denmark, I tend to use Danish. Mistral being European based I would have expected it to excel  when dealing with European languages, but I must say I have been disappointed. Where Gemini Pro 3 can chat fluently in Danish, Le Chat uses pretty awkward phrasing and struggles with capturing the intent in my questions.\n\nIs the free version different from the paid version?  \n",

I have had a single Chat with Grok in Norwegian, and I did recognize similar issues there as well. Other models for local use also suffers, like Llama.\n\nNorwegian is a language in decline, everyone learns English long before we start producing media, which means that we engage in English at a very early age, even when generating media etc.\n\nThis leads to a drought in modern datasets in the language, which makes LLMs rely on older content (Ibsen etc). That is rather arcane, thus, the responses will be similarly arcane.\n\nTLDR; Norwegian is dying, content made in modern Norwegian is rare and sparse, so LLMs rely on a time when it wasn't, so back to the 70s or so we go.",

      "text": "Was going through Vibe [v2.1.0 diff](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe/compare/v2.0.2...v2.1.0) out of curiosity and found a bunch of code that's not mentioned anywhere in the changelog.\n\n\n\n*Disclaimer: this is all from reading public source code, nothing confirmed by Mistral, everything behind disabled feature flags. If the team would rather I didn't share, happy to take it down.*\n\n\n\nThere's a hidden `/teleport` command that packages your entire Vibe session and sends it to something called \"Mistral Nuage.\" The config points to a staging domain, and the TODOs in the code say things like \"remove once the feature is publicly available.\" So it's not ready yet, but it's coming.\n\n\n\nThe part that got me interested is a fully implemented but commented-out method called `create_le_chat_thread()`. Rather than landing on some internal console, your teleported session would open as a Le Chat conversation with a cloud sandbox attached to your repo. So basically, \n\n\n**Vibe is coming to Le Chat**.\n\n\n\nRight now Vibe is terminal-only. What Mistral is building is a web coding agent inside Le Chat, backed by cloud environments that can clone your repos and apply your local changes. You'll be able to start a task in your terminal and pick it up in the browser, or the other way around, without losing any context. The upcoming underlying platform, Mistral Nuage, handles all of it: spinning up environments, running workflows, managing the back and forth. It's a new product entirely.\n\n\n\nLe Chat already has MCP connectors, so it can interact with external services. But it still needs you in the loop, watching it, prompting it. What Nuage would change is that Le Chat could go off on its own. Spin up a sandbox, clone your repo, work through a task, push code, all without you sitting there. It goes from an assistant that can use tools when you ask, to an agent that can take a job and run with it in the background, having automated daily routines, pre-programmed tasks, auto-trigger (receiving an email etc.). It basically shifts the paradigm from synchronous to asynchronous (= Le Chat can work when you sleep aha).  And the workflow system seems rather generic, GitHub is just the first connector. There's room for email, project management, CI, whatever.\n\n\n\nEverything on the Vibe side looks done and well-tested, so they're probably finalizing the infrastructure and the web interface. Wouldn't be surprised to see this in the next few weeks.",

Strong workflow foundations with an engine that doesn't burn tokens like it's a coal furnace. Mistral's models have already great personalizations and with a sandbox-first approach it can be a real agent that doesn't work for you without being a ... \"click bait machine\".\n\nIf they call it something like \"Vision\", at least internally, I would literally lose my mind 🤣 (or even \"butter\", if you know what I mean...)\n\nps. I saw the diff but didn't had the time to dig through, thank you for doing it!",
