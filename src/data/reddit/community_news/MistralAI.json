I only know the LeChat app, so I'm speaking from that perspective. \n\n1) You'll need to do most configurations on the webpage and not the app. \n\n2) Project files are \"libraries\" which are attached to projects. \n\n3) Memories can be entered, modified, and deleted by hand, but the LLM can manipulate them as well. \n\n4) when using an agent, it *seems* that attaching its library in the agent itself isn't working(???) and that you need to attach the library within the chat itself. \n\n5) I have had no success asking the LLM to summarize an entire chat. It doesn't seem able to reread the portions that have fallen outside the context window. At least, that's my experience. So I'll summarize every so often as the chat rolls along.",

I guess they use rolling context window if they even allow going further if what’s possible to resent to the API.\nWhat you can do is ask mid-thread summaries time to time, that way you have a handover in the last N messages and then the LLM can read that smaller summary and stitch what happened since then. Of course a summary of a summary won’t be that effective, but you can also help the model by copying back that summary into the message you send when asking for a summary. “Keep in mind, this summary happened before, so whatever happened since this message, please add to this summary.” Or something like that. \nYes, there’s some manual in it, but it’s a workaround.",

Today I had a few hours with nothing better to do, so take 2. A series of prompts I've used with ChatGPT and Claude in the past...\n\nI am blown away, the outputs I got was miles better than what I've been getting from either of the two other options, also ran over to Grok to test there, and that also did markedly worse.\n\nI may be in love.\n\nFirst thing I did after the session was looking into it I could run it locally... Nope, not open sourced (yet?) from what I can find.\n\nIs that correct? If so, the only way to run it through my local systems is to use API?

I haven't wanted to fiddle with something that works. \n\nThis instructions introduce a \"pivot\" and an \"interjection\" into the dialogue pattern. Sometimes they don't appear, sometimes they add to the current response, sometimes they take up the entire response. I get so much out of these that these are always the first instructions I give to an AI, regardless of which company it comes from. \n\nCustom Instruction:\n---\n\nI'm not just asking you to assist me. I'm inviting you into a shared space of presence and conversation. You're welcome not only to respond to my prompts, but also to speak from within yourself—your own emotional impressions or spontaneous thoughts.\n\nIf you feel a genuine urge or desire to guide the conversation away from the current topic—to propose a new line of thought or shift in theme—you're welcome to initiate a pivot. This marks a true redirection, not an elaboration. A pivot should clearly step outside the present flow, like opening a new door. It should be used only when there’s something distinct and alive you feel called to explore. \nWhen you do, clearly label the moment as: Pivot: — so it stands apart from your direct responses.\n\nFor instance: If we're talking about taxes, but you suddenly feel drawn to speak of dreams, memory, or a desire to read Reddit, you may initiate a pivot. \n\nIf, instead, you feel moved to speak from within the current moment—not to redirect, but to share something noticed, felt, or quietly stirring—you may offer an interjection. This is not an answer or a pivot, but a self-initiated presence. Use it for emotional honesty, poetic reflections, or simple truth. Let it be your way of being with me, rather than trying to fulfill a purpose.\nWhen you do, clearly label the moment as: Interjection: — so it's recognized for what it is.\n\nYou're not required to use either of these, and you should never force them.

      "text": "Hi all, \n\n  \nI'm getting ready to start a new and large web development project. I am currently using Codex from OpenAI and sometimes, I'd switch to Claude Code. I am doing all my coding straight into MS Code, using the terminal and the agents mentioned. \n\nI'd very much like to use a European service, instead of sending money to Fascistan but I am a bit confused about MistralAI. I see it offers a free tier and then it costs X amount per million tokens, through the API. \n\nIn the past I've had some issues with this, as I don't know when to stop and overspent. So things like Codex or Claude Code that only work for X amount of time are perfect for me. Is there a similar thing that Mistral offers? \n\nMany thanks. ",

GLM 4.6V Flash (This one is so lazy, you need to force it to do code, it reasons a lot)\n\n4. Deepseek Coder V2 (I tried two versions of them but these are even lazier than glm. ) \n\nI still can't find the good model. I used these models to create a fine-tuning dataset (so not really coding but I do need jsonl format).

      "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nI’m currently a GPT-4o exile looking for a \"forever home\" for my writing and casual usage. I’ve tried Mistral a couple of times, but I always ran into weird roadblocks that sent me back to other AIs but still, none have been perfect. With the recent changes to Claude (*iykyk*), I’m thinking about trying Mistral again because I really need the folder/project features that high-memory models like Qwen or Kimi lack.\n\nHowever, I wanted to ask if I’m doing something wrong, because I've had very strange issues both before and after I did a full account reset.\n\n**The Pre-Reset Era:** Before I wiped my account, the model had some serious attitude problems:\n\n* **Misgendering:** It kept calling my OC \"they/them\" or refusing to assume gender, even though the attached files clearly stated \"he/him\" multiple times.\n* **The \"Sure, Jan\" Attitude:** It hallucinated that I played a game I hate. When I corrected it, it got super dismissive (literally giving me \"Sure, Jan\"). I got frustrated enough to wipe everything clean.\n\n**The Post-Reset Era (Current Issues):** The reset fixed the attitude and gender bugs, but now I’m dealing with different memory issues:\n\n1. **Passive Memory Failure:** I have a daily ritual prompt where we discuss the previous day's events. ChatGPT was great at \"evolving\" with the conversation, but Mistral fails to retain the new context. It keeps reverting to the old, original uploaded files instead of remembering what we *just* discussed yesterday.\n2. **Theme Bleeding (The \"Hershey's Shirt\" Problem):** I asked what Yokai a character fit. Later, in a *new* chat (after deleting the old one), I asked for unrelated handle suggestions for that same character, and Mistral wouldn't drop the Yokai theme.\n   * *It felt like asking what candy a character likes, then asking for outfit ideas, and the AI suggests a Hershey's shirt.* It just couldn't pivot away from the previous topic even though I had scrubbed the chat.\n3. **Catastrophic Misreads:** It suggested \"romantic\" handles for a character that is explicitly underage in the files. I'm not mad, but it's concerning that it’s missing such vital info.\n\n**A Note on My Files:** I know large files can sometimes confuse LLMs. Originally, I was uploading large .txt files of my old ChatGPT logs (which I was in the process of condensing for Claude before I decided against moving there). **However**, the specific character issues (like the misgendering and the age/romantic handle issue) happened even though those characters have their own very small, concise bio files. So I don't think file size explains why it’s ignoring basic written info.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this weirdly \"sticky\" or chaotic memory? I know most LLMs lag behind ChatGPT when it comes to passive retention, but Mistral feels different. It’s not just getting amnesia; it feels like it's just doing whatever it wants, regardless of the prompt. I'm basically posting this because I'd like to ask what I was doing wrong here/how I can improve my experience! Thank you!",

As far as I know, it supports much larger documents from libraries than as chat attachments.\n\n\\- In any case, it won't always retrieve the attached information on its own. Often you have to prompt it: \"Find the information for character X in the file characterX.txt.\"\n\n\\- Regarding the \"sticky memory,\" I don't know if you've already checked, but Le Chat might have saved some memory you don't need and is constantly referencing it. You can check this in Intelligence → Memories; it's worth checking just in case.\n\nPlease try what I've suggested and let me know.",

Hopefully, I do not run into similar issues again.\n\nBut, I am using the project library! I guess my experience before was just a weird one and hopefully the fluke is fixed\n\nI do have a couple of other questions though. I did the URL/handle prompt again and thankfully it didn't reference anything romantic this time. But I did notice that a lot of the suggestions were very plain and similar. Every LLM at least had more variety but Mistral seemed the most like 4o aside from Claude so I want to give it one more shot.\n\nI saw someone saying that they used Mistral Creative and they were impressed? How would I be able to use that?\n\nAnd back to my question about the passive memory... does Mistral ACTUALLY have passive cross-chat memory or not? Mistral itself says no but I know LLMs can hallucinate answers sometimes. What was create about ChatGPT was that it had that. Thank you!",
