While it’s undeniable that there’s a gap, Mistral’s Devstral 2 model scores 72.2 on SWE-Bench verified, matching the performance of Claude Opus 4, which was released 7 months earlier.\n\nWe could argue that Mistral is only 7 months behind, despite:\n\n* Budgets **tens of times smaller**. **Mistral has raised about $3B, while OpenAI has $58B, Anthropic $37B,** Meta plans to spend $115B in 2026 alone, and xAI secured $5B just as seed funding.\n* No access to massive data centers and higher European energy costs.\n* Limited data compared to Google and others.\n\nSeven months is nothing, and coding performance is one of the best predictors of future success.\n\nAssuming the main issue is capital, how can we attract it? I’ve thought about this and believe this proposal is feasible:\n\n* Create a large government fund, similar to Norway’s pension fund, with **voluntary participation from European and non-European countries**.\n* With a modest investment (<0.5% of GDP), **we could unlock €100-300B**—a huge sum compared to current European investments.\n* The fund would invest in local innovative AI companies, support a CERN for AI, build data centers (e.g., in Norway or Canada, where energy is cheap), and fund future technologies like robotics.\n* By leveraging private investments, which would surely follow, we could reach even higher figures.\n\nWhat do you think? I’m interested in your opinions.\n\nIn my view, the benefits would be enormous:\n\n* Competitive European AI on par with the US and China.\n* Partial public control over a technology that could become dangerous.\n* Wealth creation here.\n\nAll this at a manageable initial cost, shared among many countries, and likely to pay off in the coming years with potentially massive returns.\n\nMini-spam: Since talking is good but action is better, some friends and I have created [a petition](http://openpetition.eu/!swjml) and [a website](https://ai-movement.org/) to push this project forward. If you’re interested, I’d be thrilled, but either way, I hope this sparks a meaningful discussion.\n\n[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1qs3bbw)",

They hold all the capital and have very low tolerance to risk and too long term cycles. Things have been slowly improving for the last 10 years but it's not even remotely at the pace everyone else is.\nIf you feel tech hubs like Berlin, Paris, Amsterdam they have very little to envy to others except for access to VCs.\n\nI don't want to be negative with your initiative but it's very highly unlikely that a sovereign fund or crowd capital is going to make any difference at scale (it can still get results but things don't snowball here), they move too slow and the tolerance for risk is too low.\n\nThat being said, Mistral IS competitive in the AI landscape, and IS spearheading it. Their tech is amazing across the board and they have key advantages that others cannot reach. There are other entities (that I can't name without doxxing myself too much) in the EU that are rock solid as well. \n\nSo I wouldn't talk in terms of hypotheticals. \n\nI would say let's keep running, we can already breath on their necks (otherwise we wouldn't see so much FUD spreading posts in here).",

Do you think we have a better chance?\n\nI also think public investment like these can easily repay the investment itself: if you consider a conservative private investment of the same order that will follow a public one and consider taxes + VAT you probably already almost repay the investment without even considering returns.\n\n",

(note I always wondered why Devstral ranked too low on that benchmark (either the model is too weak or the benchmark is too weak!!!!)\n\nSo I tried \n\nGPT-OSS (both on all kinds of Thinking effort options)\n\nWeird failures (sometimes call format not correct especially when used with cline and/or Goose!) \n\nAnd no instruction following (not even loose instruction following, or proper task management , so they don’t live well inside the scaffold environment (some code todo management complex prompt and things like that!) \n\nGLM-4.7-Flash\n\nSimilar story \n\nThen Cline docs and Jack Dorsey mentioned Qwen3 Coder, I scratch my head why is that small seemingly insignificant model recognized by them no idea\n\nI try it and lo and behold it works very well than others\n\nSo it is not an agent problem or me dosing misconfiguration, these other open models aren’t desgined for that (and for good reasons form the companies perspective)\n\nI am thinking of trying\n\nMinimax M2.1 or GLM-4.5-Air \n\nBut then I think about using Devstral Small 2\n\nAnd it works better than a charm finishes the task methodologically and analyzes the whole sample in like 3-5 hours \n\nA task that would have taken a junior around a month maybe (still a junior can do other stuff but maybe it dis. Better of MCP becoming exposed by default \n\nAnyways thanks Mistral Team for your awesome model and contributions to the open \n\nTL;DR\n\nDevstral Small 2 is the best for Local LLM agentic tasks (beyond being compared to others!)",

Benchmarks are neat, but they're not reflective of end user experience:\n\nOn the domain of literature, it's largely a question of taste. It lands in the ballpark of 4o there for me, on fact finding, DeepResearch exceeds that of current ChatGPT (well, tested in december when I still were subscriped to ChatGPT, but assume it still holds).\n\nWhen it comes to straight up reasoning though, it's usually slightly above 4o, but handily beaten by ChatGPT5-series models, and usually Grok as well. When it fails though... when it fails it's ugly.\n\nAt least it fails so hard that it's hard to take seriously, making it really easy for the user to flag it as bad info.\n\nThis was kinda what put me off, alongside the short context window they had back then, in like Jan 2025, when I first tried it, when that failure mode was more the norm than the exception.\n\nThat experience put me off the whole thing like the plague, but coming back when OpenAI lost their mind, I found it immensely improved, and the creative model is in fistfights with Grok-4.1 and ChatGPT5-series models, occasionally exceeding.\n\nI would say, Mistral is lagging sligthly against the infinity money black hole models, but it's more sustainable, and keeps improving over time, making it a legitimate player in the field.\n\nYou can get the latest and greatest, along with the US soft colonialism, if you want with the US models, or you can hang back a spell over in Mistral, for a lower price and a more trustworthy creator.\n\nThe latter has increasingly become very important for me at least.

Musk's Grok was notorious for having a relatively low price per token, but it uses absurd amount of tokens on reasoning (tokens that Grok, unlike most other LLMs, never sends to you), making it one of the most expensive models on the market. Qwen 3 suffered from similar issues. And... so does Mistral Large.\n\nSee https://artificialanalysis.ai/#cost - switch to Intelligence vs cost, enable all the latest models from Mistral AI and you will see that compared to the rest of the market - Mistral AI is one of the least cost-effective providers. Devstral2 might be the first model that breaks that pattern, but so far its real-world performance has been mixed bag, and it's clearly below Sonnet 4.5.\n\nEspecially when you have GLM-4.7 that actually DOES offer you Sonnet 4.5 performance at a lower cost. Heck: GLM 4.7 is cheaper than Devstral2! ([$0.4/$1.9](https://openrouter.ai/z-ai/glm-4.7?sort=price) vs [$0.4/$2.0](https://openrouter.ai/mistralai/devstral-2512?sort=price), and with GLM you can have it even cheaper thanks to caching ($0.08), something Devstral2 does not offer).\n\n(If you want to know more about cost efficiency, you can start with [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRWLQGMGY80), it's fairly accessible and a decent starting point)",

I asked all of them to help me better understand the Greeks and I found: \n\n  \n1. Chat GPT made regular mistakes on the interpretation of the Greeks because an Option with Expiry date 30/09/2026 was classified as a LEAP with an expiry date in 2027. I asked it twice to review its analysis and twice it supported the wrong thing. I then asked it to count from January to September and tell me how are these 400 and something days? It then said, you are right and stated that based on the fact that between January and September we have x days, my analysis on Delta, Implied volatility is incorrect and this is a crap deal. So reading the fine print showed me that it was Hallucinating for some reason. \n\n2. Grok: much better answer and better refinement by also providing hedging bets to cover potential losses arising from the trade. Chat GPT needed to be asked additional questions for this. Also Grok said that this trade is rather neutral and i should buy the equity rather than go into options i am a fan of slow and steady growth. This was nice to see however I was expecting more math and tangible evidence for the recommendation. \n\n  \n3. Le Chat - Mistral : straight and to the point but was more conservative than both Chat GPT and Grok. It made sure to avoid absolutes in its statements and simply kept to the surface by theorising. I had to press it hard to give me more criteria to take decisions and this was adequate, however I was still expecting a more comprehensive and mathematical analysis as to why it was basing its decision on so and so. \n\n  \nI guess we are not there yet for this type of scenarios.",

      "text": "I’ve spent the last month running Mistral Large 3 against the new Claude 4.5 and GPT-5.1 \"Thinking\" modes, and I’ve come to a conclusion that might annoy the purists here. If I had to pick one for logic-heavy, technical writing where I don't want a \"guidance counselor\" lecturing me on my tone, Mistral is the winner, but only if you aren't paying the $20 \"tax\" for a single-model sub.\n\nMistral Large 3 is fundamentally the best ai writing tool for anyone who needs high-density output without the sycophancy. While GPT-5 tries to guess what I want to hear and Claude gets bogged down in its own safety \"Constitutional\" logic, Mistral just executes the Markdown. It treats the prompt like a set of instructions, not a suggestion.\n\nImportantly, the reasoning depth here (let me elaborate!!) is finally at parity with the frontier models, but without the \"lobotomy\" effect we see after a model’s been out for six months. I’ve been testing this by running complex document analysis through writingmate, where I can flip between Mistral and the other models in a single thread. such a  \"hallucination drift\" is significantly lower on Mistral when you're dealing with non-English technical specs or legacy codebases, at least I found this to be true for my workflow.\n\nThe real problem isn't the model; it’s the fragmentation. Most people claim ChatGPT is the best ai writing tool simply because they’ve already paid the $20 and don't want to admit it's lagging in raw reasoning. But the minute you need to cross-check a hallucination or run a deep search without the \"Exactly!\" and \"Sharp observation!\" fluff, the value of a single-model subscription falls apart.\n\nClaude and Gemini are great for their specific moats (f.e. Claude for narrative, Gemini for the 2M context window), but Mistral is the only one that feels like it’s built for professionals who want a tool, not a friend. My skeptic take? Perhaps, stop overpaying for the \"big brand\" wrappers and start using a brief stack of tools that let you use the right logic for the right task.",

Instead of the model just cramming everything into the context window and hallucinating when it gets full, Mistral pulls only what’s relevant. It’s way more stable for long-term technical work. So I often use Writingmate to A/B test the recall between them and overall compare models side by side, and while GPT feels more intuitive, Mistral is much more transparent about what it’s actually pulling from your history. You won't get that \"as an AI assistant\" lecture every five minutes either, which is a massive plus. There's also a trade-off which is, Mistral won't remember a random chat from three weeks ago unless you specifically tell it to save that info to your memory or project.

(yes, I did the testing).\n* Image generation is kinda mid. (afaik, they are still using FLUX by black forest labs, not flux 2)\n* No text to speech, but their transcription of voice input is great and FAST!\n* Their document management uses a concept of different \"libraries\" of documents, that you can then use in different chats.\n\nPrompting mistral needs to be more strict and detail oriented. Especially if you need it to access a file, you need to very EXPLICITLY tell it to do so.   \nThis is very different from CGPT which feels like it is swimming in the provided documents and accesses them too eagerly at times.\n\nOverall, I am very happy with it.",

I guess a better official integration will come sooner or later, but feel free to use it as an interim :)",

Is this normal? I tell it not to and correct it of course, however when you straight out ask it if it can draw info. From another chat, it tells you it can't and each chat is self-contained.

But is it me who is using it wrong or what? \n\nI really want to do the switch, but it’s literally useless. \n\nE.g., I have a a complex “people situation” within a “association” \n\nIt consist of meeting resumes, a legal document that defines legislation on the specific area, mails in PDF formats. \n\nI have somewhat 20 documents uploaded as files in a project. \n\nIt kinda scans them and makes a plan, but the details are shit. \n\nSo e.g., I used 20 minutes to explain who is who, even though it was described in the first message to it. \n\nThen I spent 20 minutes to clear up that a march meeting was out of question (one of the documents specifically describes to process of how, when, where and who will arrange this meeting) \n\nAnd it keeps suggesting that we do it ourselves without those I’ve said 20 times must fucking hold the meeting. \n\nThen it seemed it actually got that part right - nice. 2 messages later and everything was one big mixup again. \n\nAnd this shit just continues. \n\nDid the same in gpt - thought for a good 5-6 minutes, got it 95% right. Just had to clear up a few mistakes and off we go. \n\nThis is the same store every time I use mistral. Also with coding, less complex tasks etc. \n\nit forgets or doesn’t understand explicitly. \n\nI have the “pro” paid version of both chats. What the fuck am I doing wrong?

It has drawbacks.\n\n\\> Then it seemed it actually got that part right - nice. 2 messages later and everything was one big mixup again.\n\nChatbot's perfs (abilities to follow instruction) degrade as the discussion keep on going. When it makes a mistake, it has difficulties to ignore the error even if you corrected it and it told you \"got it! I made a mistake\". The reason why is that an LLM like Mistral as no \"mind state\" beyond what's written in the discussion. It has no inner voice. Its \"decisions\" are fully based on the past text. So when this past text is spoiled with bad ideas, it snowballs in even more stupidity in the following discussion. That's the same thing that when you says \"don't do that\" and it makes the chatbot doing it even more.\n\n\\> What the fuck am I doing wrong?\n\nFor complex task, you have to do \"context engineering\", that is producing the best prompt with related documents to your problem. You missed something or the model got it wrong? Rule Number 1: \\*Start a new session\\* with a fixed prompt where things are clearer. Rule Number 2: \\*Don't Don't\\* Formulate your needs without telling what the model mustn't do as it makes thing worse. Rule Number 3: \\*Garbage In / Garbage Out\\* Try filtering the input to focus on your current concern. Rule Number 4: \\*Don't plan immediatly\". Force Mitral to read the document by asking it to summarize them (if the summary is fake, there is an issue with your config and the documents are not here). Only after Mistral has read everything which matters, introduce it to your problem.\n\nThere are so many quirks, I can't tell all. For example, if it can't access a document you mention and you chat with Mistral like it has to know it, it may likely hallucinate details by switching into a kind of role-playing mode.",
