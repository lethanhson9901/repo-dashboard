I think it can handle a lot of the implementation but the competition is just easier to work with it seems.\n\nAt the same time I am happy to see Mistral Vibe BUT the documentation is either very limited or very hard to find. I came to the conclusion it is incomplete. I may be wrong. For example, I know Vibe supports skills because I saw the release notes but try finding the documentation on it.\n\nIn general I  do not think it reasonable to expect people to beta test a product (Vibe) that is lagging behind on the competition so much.\n\nWhat would keep me trying Vibe and Devstral is being able to use it free, daily or weekly limits are reasonable to impose, until it has caught up more to the competition.\n\nSo please consider making the Devstral models (limited) free on Mistral Vibe.  \n(I do not know what is technically possible given the trouble Claude Code is having limiting the subscription model to Claude Code only but a clear TOS from the help may help.)\n\nThis way I could keep on using (and testing) both.",

This includes function names, local variable names etc. It also stopped like 10 times and tried persuading me that I shouldn't continue as it's a lot of work :D I mean it's free but I could have done this by hand in 15min.\n\nOther tasks it performed way below sonnet. Maybe at the level of gemini or gbt (not sure, i dont use them much)\n\nAlso, Claude CLI + Sonnet took about 2min to do the same task in the same codebase",

It's a nice model and it's got it's niche but glm 4.7 is usually better and more flexible even quantised to a similar size as devstral. It is a useful thing and I'm trying to use it more if only to support a european company but I think it kind of misses the benefit of being the only big dense model that will fit on a local 128GB machine (i.e. being smarter than anything comparable in size) due to said lack of thinking. For a really really smart model I could run locally I would be willing to wait but because it doesn't think it is not actually smarter than a q2 quantised glm 4.7 that also fits on my machine and it's slower. \n\nThats my take at the moment, I'm trying to explore it more, see if I can get more out of it.",

Anecdotally, Devstral Small 2 repeatedly beats GPT-OSS-120B on my codebases despite being so far apart on benchmarks.\n\nGLM 4.7 Flash on the other hand is also excellent and kicks the 120B on the same stuff I'm working (ML, financial algos, Rust, NextJS, etc), but Devstral Small 2 has more eye to detail where GLM left some issues I had \"as is\".\n\nHowever, GLM 4.7 Flash is broadly smarter and more update to date on greater schemes compared to Devstral but has less knack on repo work. Like them both, but I lean towards Devstral over the fact it has more enterprise grade efficiency. Could be bias, but I like minimalistic response, and it can be extensively detailed when require (docs, blueprints >1k lines).\n\nAnother important note that resonates with my experience, the GPT-OSS models have large response variance where Devstral is more deterministic and is consistent on every round, and this reflected on SWE-Rebench charts from Ibragim.\n\nI find this variance inconvenient for coding despite tighter sampling as repeated, personal tests yielded different results.\n\nI haven't used GLM 4.7 Flash long enough to detect that but generally the apple doesn't fall far from tree if it follows the grand 4.7.",

I don't have beefy enough hardware locally to run it at a reasonable speed and last I checked the only cloud inference providers offering the devstral-2 models will train on your data (Mistral included for their consumer offerings).  On OpenRouter you get Mistral or Chutes, that's it.\n\nI'm hoping some cloud inference providers will pick up devstral-2 (and devstral-small-2) after tomorrow once Mistral starts charging for the API access.

The solution? **A single environment variable.**\n\n**Debugging a Memory Leak in vLLM**\n\nA few months ago, one of our teams investigated a suspected memory leak in **vLLM**.

Depends, definitely not for professional scenarios with brownfield projects, Claude Opus 4.5 is unbeatable at the moment in this regards and Sonnet 4.5 as well GPT 5.2 Codex follow closely, even Gemini 3 Pro does a good job. Unfortunately it's also to expensive, I have a Github Copilot Plan an you get a lot out of 40 Euro per Month, vs. a few Devstral 2 sessions can cost much more and lead to much less, because it has zero caching at the moment. However, I think Mistral could catch up if they don't waste to much time on tool building but instead focus on improving their model just like DeepSeek and the Chinese competition like GLM does. I personally use OpenCode these days, it just works, no need for Vibe CLI.\n\nEDIT: I see that I haven't been charged for Devstral usage for a long time, is it still free? I thought it's just free in December.  \nEDIT2: Yes it is: [https://docs.mistral.ai/models/devstral-2-25-12](https://docs.mistral.ai/models/devstral-2-25-12) So I'm going to use it more, since I think the biggest advantage is that is blazingly fast and if it's free that's ideal for subagent tasks.",

It just aligns so well with what I’m looking for, simply perfect.\n\n**Now, the bad**:\n\nAfter a dozen responses, it starts looping. It repeats the same structure obsessively. The opener is usually a stage direction / third-person style comment followed by em-dash. The closing comment is something cheesy between parenthesis. Markdown formatting is injected everywhere even if forbidden in the sys prompt.\n\nHas anyone had any success in using this model in the context of a chat/companion app? System prompt, temperature, mid-chat steering... Nothing has been working so far.\n\nI have tried plenty of other models, but none comes close to the tone and voice Ministral offers. So, I’m on a hunt to understand if there’s anything that can tame this obsessive looping and poor instruction-following.",

Let me clarify: I'm not a developer. I use AI to search for information, help with solo role-playing games (RPG), and research Warhammer 40k lore and similar topics. With Claude, I feel like I'm in heaven, but I understand that more and more (especially in recent days), it would be better to distance myself from US services. For some time now, I've been trying to use Le Chat, but every time it seems to be lagging behind. It's as if it doesn't consider the nuances in what I say, doesn't analyze in depth, always stops at the first point, and doesn't go into detail thoroughly. Am I doing something wrong? Should I create specific agents? Should I give it more precise and less discursive instructions? I tend to create queries as if I were talking to a person, and this works well with Claude, but maybe not here? I need some feedback from those who use it as their main AI.",

I can continue the conversation but it often stops in the middle of a task. Sometimes without the error printing. \n\n  \nNetwork on my side is fine, and using the api via curl works also without problem. Even in repitition with short intervalls. \n\nIt only happens within the Vibe CLI. \n\n  \nOr is there a general issue? Usage spikes etc ? How can I debug this? \n\n\n\n  \n",
