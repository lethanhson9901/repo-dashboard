ChatGPT also let's you create agents, but agents work much better on le chat, also with libraries.

If you give them hidden trauma, hidden motives, or hidden twists, they will use it immediately because generalist models tend to push the story toward resolutions as fast as possible.  \nSo keep your character sheet minimal: public facts only.  \nAnything the LLM discovers *in-scene*, you can later add to your sheet.\n\n**About them meeting as strangers:**  \nNo problem at all.  \nOnly write what the rest of the characters really know, should be able to observe or infer.  \nAs the story progresses, you can update the sheet with things that become public or discovered naturally.\n\n**Checkpoints / Plot**  \nYour checkpoint method is great. I use something similar, but per chapter.  \nJust one important thing:  \nCreate checkpoints after the event has happened, not before.  \nIf you announce “In this chapter X will happen”, the LLM will accelerate the scene unnaturally to force that outcome.  \nIf you wait until the scene is done, then write the checkpoint, you get continuity without railroading.\n\nThis isn’t a Le Chat issue; it’s a general LLM behavior.  \nModels try to “close the loop” as soon as they see the target.  \nThe good thing is that Le Chat tends to feel less nanny and more willing to play along, so you’ll get nicer organic twists than in other platforms.  \n  \n**Stylebook / Rules / Setting**  \nYour RP rules look great.  \nAnd yes: if you have anything about setting, location, mood, red lines, boundaries, put it there too.  \nAll that helps the model stay consistent.\n\nYou’re on the right track 😊",

      "text": "\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI’m excited to share a project I’ve been working on: **word-GPT-Plus-for-mistral.ai-and-openwebui**.\n\nThis is a specialized fork of the fantastic **word-GPT-Plus** plugin. First and foremost, I want to give a **huge shoutout and a massive thank you to the original creators of** [**word-GPT-Plus**](https://github.com/Kuingsmile/word-GPT-Plus). Their incredible work provided the perfect foundation for me to build these specific integrations.\n\nWhat’s the \"Key\" in this fork?\n\nWhile I've optimized it for **Mistral AI** \n\n**caution: only self-hosted-version! so you have to run your own instance of the plugin!** \n\nEssential Setup (Must-Read!):\n\nTo get the most out of these features, please read the PLUGIN\\_PROVIDERS.md. It covers:\n\n* **Open WebUI Sync:** How to use your API Key/JWT and Base URL (e.g., `http://YOUR_IP:PORT/api`) to fetch your custom models automatically.\n* **Mistral AI Integration:** Connect to Mistral's official API using the [`https://api.mistral.ai/v1`](https://api.mistral.ai/v1) endpoint.\n* **Provider Configuration:** How to switch between local privacy (Open WebUI) and high-performance cloud models (Mistral) with a single click.\n\n**Why use this?**\n\n* **Direct Model Selection:** Choose from your specific Open WebUI model list without leaving Word.\n* **Privacy & Control:** Keep your documents local by routing everything through your own server.\n* **Enhanced Workflow:** Summarize, rewrite, and use \"Agent Mode\" to structure documents using your favorite Mistral or Llama models direct in MS Word.\n\nheck it out here:\n\n[https://github.com/hyperion14/word-GPT-Plus-for-mistral.ai-and-openwebui](https://github.com/hyperion14/word-GPT-Plus-for-mistral.ai-and-openwebui)\n\nI’d love to hear your feedback and see how you’re using it! If you like the tool, please consider starring both the original repo and this fork.\n\nHappy new year! \n\nI hope you like it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h67v0eidf3bg1.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ac164fbee529617d6a611da3597700d2163a97f\n\n# ",

That's more than enough memory, the model loads successfully in ollama or LMStudio and chat works fine. But it doesn't seem to work well with coding UIs. Here's the different setups I've tried. In each case, I have a markdown file describing bugs in some code and I prompt the model to read the bug reports, and make changes to one code file that would address two issues.\n\n\\- Model served with \\`ollama run devstral-2\\`, used via \\`vibe\\`. The model asks me to make changes to files. I ask whether it can do it itself, it says \"Yes, I can write files using the write\\_file tool! I can create new files or overwrite existing ones. If you'd like me to write or modify a file, just let me know the file path and the content you'd like to include.\" But it doesn't use the tool. I asked it to, and it replied with \\`read\\_file\\[ARGS\\]{\"path\": \"filename\"}\\`, like the attempt to use a tool just appeared in the chat.\n\n\\- Model served in ollama, used via Roo Code. It asked to create a markdown file describing its changes, I told it not to and to fix the source file itself. It encountered \"API Request Failed: unexpected end of JSON input\".\n\n\\- Model served in ollama, used via Continue VSCodium extension. When I apply changes to the file, it just deletes the original content without adding its changes.\n\n\\- Model served in LMStudio, used via Roo Code. Attempts to use tools hit a prompt template error: \"Error rendering prompt with jinja template: \"After the optional system message, conversation roles must alternate user and assistant roles except for tool calls and results.\".\n\n\\- Model served in LMStudio, used via \\`vibe\\`. This is the only configuration I've tried that seems to work reliably. The model updates its TODOs correctly, and makes changes to files.\n\n\\- Model served in LMStudio, used via Continue. Tool use attempts just appear in the output stream.\n\n  \nHas anybody got a setup that works reliably they could share, please, or guidance to either diagnose these issues or route problem reports to the correct places?",
