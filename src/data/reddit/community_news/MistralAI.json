      "text": "Spending most of my time on Claude’s Max 20x plan (Opus 4.5) and occasionally hitting my weekly limits, I decided to revisit **Mistral Vibe 2.0** and **Le Chat** after a long break. Here are my first impressions, especially compared to Opus 4.5 and Codex CLI.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Codex CLI (5.2), Underwhelming First Impressions**\n\nI tested Codex in a structured folder with lots of context (files, scripts, and dedicated system for specific workflows that are to be followed). On first prompts and even after instructing it to analyze the **folder context**, it struggled to understand or comply and generate based on an understanding of the surrounding context. It felt less like a true CLI tool and more like a system just inlining requests without grasping the environment. Big asterix: It's also my first time trying codex and I need to explore it more, but the first results were disappointing.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Mistral Vibe 2.0**\n\nReally great first impression, I was very pleasantly surprised!\n\nIt really stood out was how thoroughly Mistral Vibe 2.0 tried to understand the context first (even without being told to do so). It didn’t just jump into answering; it checked the surrounding files, analyzed available examples, and tried to understand what a good outcome would look like before starting to work.\n\nAnd I was blown away by how **fast** Mistral Vibe 2.0 is. The response generation is so quick that I can’t even read along as it outputs. This is a game-changer for feedback loops. While I of course believe that Claude Opus 4.5 is currently the king for coding and complex tasks, I’ll be testing Mistral Vibe 2.0 much more for coding and general tasks to see how it performs. For everyday structured tasks, Mistral’s first impression suggests it could be a **fantastic alternative and fallback system**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Le Chat App**\nThe Le Chat app has improved significantly since I last tried it:\n* Voice input is now a thing, and it’s seamless! (Claude struggles a lot with this) When I last used Le Chat, this feature didn’t even exist. I tested it with a long, multi-minute transcription, and the accuracy was impressive. I did a few feedback rounds, and Mistral applied my edits smoothly. I’m not sure how they made it *that* fast—**the turnaround times for voice transcription and immediate answers are incredibly impressive**.\n* Online research seemed also to work great  and possibly now on par with ChatGPT?\nI’m not even sure yet what other awesome features and UX additions there are, but I’m excited to explore further.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Potential Switch?**\nGiven Mistral’s speed, UX, and awesome voice transcription, etc, I’m seriously considering making Le Chat + Mistral Vibe 2.0 my daily driver for everyday tasks and as a fallback when Claude’s limits kick in (and Le Chat possibly always preferred because of the speed and the great voice transcription in multiple languages). I’ll test-drive it for a few days, and if it proves as powerful as I hope (writing this as a \"wow, just tried this\" post, so maybe lots of honey moon phase involved), I might cancel my ChatGPT subscription and make Le Chat my main driver for everyday use.\n\nI’m all for EU digital sovereignty, so supporting Mistral feels like a win-win and I am incredibly happy & excited about all the progress being made.\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n* **First rough impressions**: Just excited to share my initial enthusiasm for Mistral Vibe 2.0 and Le Chat after revisiting them.\n* **Codex CLI** felt underwhelming as a CLI tool, especially with folder context. Not sure about code quality and similar yet (also very first impression).\n* **Mistral Vibe 2.0** impressed with speed and context handling; I’ll test it more for coding.\n* **Le Chat app** now includes voice input and shines with great transcription quality, incredible speed (game changer for back and forth loops), and online research\n* While **Opus 4.5 likely remains unmatched for coding**, Mistral’s first impression suggests it could be a **fantastic alternative and fallback system** for everyday tasks.\n\n\nBig thank you to the Mistral team for all the hard work! Rooting for you big time ♥️🇪🇺!",

          "text": "Collecting new findings here as I continue testing: \n\n* I am not super happy with it being pretty hard to copy from the CLI progress. Often I need to \"reply\" to something the agents do and the UX loops around that are crucial. It's pretty bad at the moment, the UI needs a long time to react and seems to include some automatic \"copied!\" feature, that appears very late multiple times and that I don't really care about. Easy direct select -> right click -> copy would be best and should be fast and fluid. That's a \"small\" thing that makes a **huge** difference. \n* Scrolling can also be pretty sluggish (very very late start and keys like 'end' also have many seconds of delay). Possibly tracked here: https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe/issues/222\n* There must be a specific system in place for interruptions? The agent reacted much faster than Claude Code Opus to a \"no\" during generation. Basically almost immediate stop\n* CLI text input seems a bit sluggish when much is happening\n* Context usage seems to go up fairly slowly. Not sure if that's a good or bad thing (testing it for some coding right now).\n* Every response / input during generation seems to be treated as an interruption (so no \"next task queuing\" like with Claude Code). Maybe there is a way to queue?",

Especially in the last weeks instruction following was pretty much non-existent for the few tests I did and I have been avoiding it ever since. \nBut I also mostly used the web interface so far, so maybe it's a different story with the CLI. \n\nI would have very much recommended Claude Code with Opus 4.5 and used to be *insane* around release / December, but has deteriorated massively in terms of quality the last few weeks. Possibly due to a switch from Google GPUs to the ones they developed with AWS, but not sure.  \nStill, it is very much worth a try if you go for the 5x or 20x max plans (they are very worth it). API pricing would be incredibly expensive (easy to burn through 20-80 bucks an hour). \n\nRegarding your questions: \nYes, API key pay as you go exists and I think the subscription now also included some vague notion of \"full day coding\"? \n\nPicture generate would likely mean an additional model, but that should be easy to integrate into your workflow (e.g. continue using Gemini's very powerful nano-banana-pro or flux).\n\nGreat to hear that you care about European tools!",

It didn't realize that, so it added more and more characters to the pattern until it was huge -- without ever thinking \"is this overkill? That looks weirdly huge\" even though the purpose of the code was just to make sure a line starts with the word \"AGENT:\".\n\nThis is something that could have been autonomously fixed with an orchestrator that includes failure analysis, sees the blind spot, and proposes an alternate approach before launching another attempt. A reasoning model might also have a much easier time course-correcting.\n\nI was using the CLI by itself so I just said \"try to simplify the regular expression by writing it from scratch, and if it still fails, just write a parser\" -- it failed fast and wrote a parser, then got back to work.",

Even if it means less optimal product. \n\nI've tried the free Mistral version for a while now and I am pretty happy about it, but it's not quite at the level of the paid OpenAI models. \n\nCan someone share their experience with the difference between the paid Mistral and OpenAI and how to optimize/personalize Mistrals output?\n\nI work both with API interactions and the chat interface \n\nThank you",

(note I always wondered why Devstral ranked too low on that benchmark (either the model is too weak or the benchmark is too weak!!!!)\n\nSo I tried \n\nGPT-OSS (both on all kinds of Thinking effort options)\n\nWeird failures (sometimes call format not correct especially when used with cline and/or Goose!) \n\nAnd no instruction following (not even loose instruction following, or proper task management , so they don’t live well inside the scaffold environment (some code todo management complex prompt and things like that!) \n\nGLM-4.7-Flash\n\nSimilar story \n\nThen Cline docs and Jack Dorsey mentioned Qwen3 Coder, I scratch my head why is that small seemingly insignificant model recognized by them no idea\n\nI try it and lo and behold it works very well than others\n\nSo it is not an agent problem or me dosing misconfiguration, these other open models aren’t desgined for that (and for good reasons form the companies perspective)\n\nI am thinking of trying\n\nMinimax M2.1 or GLM-4.5-Air \n\nBut then I think about using Devstral Small 2\n\nAnd it works better than a charm finishes the task methodologically and analyzes the whole sample in like 3-5 hours \n\nA task that would have taken a junior around a month maybe (still a junior can do other stuff but maybe it dis. Better of MCP becoming exposed by default \n\nAnyways thanks Mistral Team for your awesome model and contributions to the open \n\nTL;DR\n\nDevstral Small 2 is the best for Local LLM agentic tasks (beyond being compared to others!)",

Musk's Grok was notorious for having a relatively low price per token, but it uses absurd amount of tokens on reasoning (tokens that Grok, unlike most other LLMs, never sends to you), making it one of the most expensive models on the market. Qwen 3 suffered from similar issues. And... so does Mistral Large.\n\nSee https://artificialanalysis.ai/#cost - switch to Intelligence vs cost, enable all the latest models from Mistral AI and you will see that compared to the rest of the market - Mistral AI is one of the least cost-effective providers. Devstral2 might be the first model that breaks that pattern, but so far its real-world performance has been mixed bag, and it's clearly below Sonnet 4.5.\n\nEspecially when you have GLM-4.7 that actually DOES offer you Sonnet 4.5 performance at a lower cost. Heck: GLM 4.7 is cheaper than Devstral2! ([$0.4/$1.9](https://openrouter.ai/z-ai/glm-4.7?sort=price) vs [$0.4/$2.0](https://openrouter.ai/mistralai/devstral-2512?sort=price), and with GLM you can have it even cheaper thanks to caching ($0.08), something Devstral2 does not offer).\n\n(If you want to know more about cost efficiency, you can start with [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRWLQGMGY80), it's fairly accessible and a decent starting point)",

Chat GPT made regular mistakes on the interpretation of the Greeks because an Option with Expiry date 30/09/2026 was classified as a LEAP with an expiry date in 2027. I asked it twice to review its analysis and twice it supported the wrong thing. I then asked it to count from January to September and tell me how are these 400 and something days? It then said, you are right and stated that based on the fact that between January and September we have x days, my analysis on Delta, Implied volatility is incorrect and this is a crap deal. So reading the fine print showed me that it was Hallucinating for some reason. \n\n2. Grok: much better answer and better refinement by also providing hedging bets to cover potential losses arising from the trade. Chat GPT needed to be asked additional questions for this. Also Grok said that this trade is rather neutral and i should buy the equity rather than go into options i am a fan of slow and steady growth. This was nice to see however I was expecting more math and tangible evidence for the recommendation. \n\n  \n3. Le Chat - Mistral : straight and to the point but was more conservative than both Chat GPT and Grok. It made sure to avoid absolutes in its statements and simply kept to the surface by theorising. I had to press it hard to give me more criteria to take decisions and this was adequate, however I was still expecting a more comprehensive and mathematical analysis as to why it was basing its decision on so and so. \n\n  \nI guess we are not there yet for this type of scenarios.",

      "text": "I’ve spent the last month running Mistral Large 3 against the new Claude 4.5 and GPT-5.1 \"Thinking\" modes, and I’ve come to a conclusion that might annoy the purists here. If I had to pick one for logic-heavy, technical writing where I don't want a \"guidance counselor\" lecturing me on my tone, Mistral is the winner, but only if you aren't paying the $20 \"tax\" for a single-model sub.\n\nMistral Large 3 is fundamentally the best ai writing tool for anyone who needs high-density output without the sycophancy. While GPT-5 tries to guess what I want to hear and Claude gets bogged down in its own safety \"Constitutional\" logic, Mistral just executes the Markdown. It treats the prompt like a set of instructions, not a suggestion.\n\nImportantly, the reasoning depth here (let me elaborate!!) is finally at parity with the frontier models, but without the \"lobotomy\" effect we see after a model’s been out for six months. I’ve been testing this by running complex document analysis through writingmate, where I can flip between Mistral and the other models in a single thread. such a  \"hallucination drift\" is significantly lower on Mistral when you're dealing with non-English technical specs or legacy codebases, at least I found this to be true for my workflow.\n\nThe real problem isn't the model; it’s the fragmentation. Most people claim ChatGPT is the best ai writing tool simply because they’ve already paid the $20 and don't want to admit it's lagging in raw reasoning. But the minute you need to cross-check a hallucination or run a deep search without the \"Exactly!\" and \"Sharp observation!\" fluff, the value of a single-model subscription falls apart.\n\nClaude and Gemini are great for their specific moats (f.e. Claude for narrative, Gemini for the 2M context window), but Mistral is the only one that feels like it’s built for professionals who want a tool, not a friend. My skeptic take? Perhaps, stop overpaying for the \"big brand\" wrappers and start using a brief stack of tools that let you use the right logic for the right task.",

Yet if you’re looking at lechat , in my xp  It’s less \"vibe-based\" and more literal. Their Project Libraries actually beat GPT in my opinion because they index your files properly. Instead of the model just cramming everything into the context window and hallucinating when it gets full, Mistral pulls only what’s relevant. It’s way more stable for long-term technical work. So I often use Writingmate to A/B test the recall between them and overall compare models side by side, and while GPT feels more intuitive, Mistral is much more transparent about what it’s actually pulling from your history. You won't get that \"as an AI assistant\" lecture every five minutes either, which is a massive plus. There's also a trade-off which is, Mistral won't remember a random chat from three weeks ago unless you specifically tell it to save that info to your memory or project. It’s more manual, but somwewhat better for privacy and focus.",

Benchmarks are neat, but they're not reflective of end user experience:\n\nOn the domain of literature, it's largely a question of taste. It lands in the ballpark of 4o there for me, on fact finding, DeepResearch exceeds that of current ChatGPT (well, tested in december when I still were subscriped to ChatGPT, but assume it still holds).\n\nWhen it comes to straight up reasoning though, it's usually slightly above 4o, but handily beaten by ChatGPT5-series models, and usually Grok as well. When it fails though... when it fails it's ugly.\n\nAt least it fails so hard that it's hard to take seriously, making it really easy for the user to flag it as bad info.\n\nThis was kinda what put me off, alongside the short context window they had back then, in like Jan 2025, when I first tried it, when that failure mode was more the norm than the exception.\n\nThat experience put me off the whole thing like the plague, but coming back when OpenAI lost their mind, I found it immensely improved, and the creative model is in fistfights with Grok-4.1 and ChatGPT5-series models, occasionally exceeding.\n\nI would say, Mistral is lagging sligthly against the infinity money black hole models, but it's more sustainable, and keeps improving over time, making it a legitimate player in the field.\n\nYou can get the latest and greatest, along with the US soft colonialism, if you want with the US models, or you can hang back a spell over in Mistral, for a lower price and a more trustworthy creator.\n\nThe latter has increasingly become very important for me at least. Moreso than LLM raw strength.\n\n(also, doesn't hurt that there's a open model that I can run at home as well, just in case)",

          "text": "For context, I spent billions in tokens last year in prototypes and public facing, production work and it's mostly financial models interacting with 6 figures contracts. Shrimp in my circles, small, but produces income. \n\nRoughly, 70-80% of the jobs produced last year, had to be polished using SOTA closed source models, but I'm seeing that gap closing considerably fast and Devstral Small 2 beats GPT-OSS-120B on the same tasks, and has been doing more work than any OSS model up to 235B model I've used last year.\n\nI wish I could speak better about Mistral Vibe, as my experience was short-lived due to context bloat and errors - using the local Devstral Small 2 UD-Q4_K_XL which also had its issues with inference engines and stale quants. This is fixed by now but I've got plenty of experience with it since then, and I've been riding the Q8_0 which has been God. \n\nI assume Devstral 2 will be in the same ballpark with a better punch in knowledge. \n\nWhen Mistral Vibe launched, the context management blew up quickly and it often derailed. It may not be the case now based on what I've seen. \n\nBased on experience, any model is as good as the agentic framework is operating on, and how good is your context engineering for that specific setup. \n\nMost likely it will be your context work. I polished mine by repeating different cases in my codebases, using different prompts styles until I had repeated, positive results. \n\nNo walls of text prompts. Less is more, but not bare. \n\nKeep working out the environment you're using until you get better. It pays long-term, a LOT. \n\nIf you haven't produced reliable outputs every time, and you start jumping around different agentic tools and models, I guarantee you'll be frustrated. \n\nI found Devstral to work better with Kilocode with a custom agent I made, that saves me over 90% of context over original agents. Opencode works very well too, but Kilocode offers me Orchestrator choice which cuts most context bloat into smaller jobs for my custom agent. I might try Mistral Vibe back again later. \n\nMy base template for all repos must always include a folder for docs and that will generally include a blueprint with project spec overview, and a README.md which explains how the project works downstream. \n\nMost folks likely use AGENTS.md for repo context, which is generally fine. I like to break my docs modular enough, that isn't going to bloat the agent, but isn't hard enough to maintain either. \n\nThey complement each other. (How it works and where). Sometimes I ditch the README.md when I know the job doesn't require it, and that keeps my model light.\n\nIf I have a mono repo with different frameworks, I still use a single blueprint for the whole codebase and a single README.md, but I create separate sub-folder docs for each framework with their own framework-specific spec overview and directories. \n\nIn this last case, if I had to work in the front-end, I'd feed only the framework doc and not the whole blueprint and README.md. \n\nIf the work involved another framework, you could add the whole codebase blueprint and the other framework work doc too, and it works itself out. \n\nYou essentially make a modular doc system that doesn't add too much technical debt to maintain, and can be used whenever needed without giving the whole elephant every time. \n\nWhen it comes to prompt style, just simply write one and ask the model to format in a way it would understand and execute. Same with the documents. Devstral 2 models can surprisingly produce extensive documents if needed. \n\nI've used prompt styles from GPT-OSS-120B which broke Devstral. This is important.",

Also I use Claude Code and OpenCode rather than Vibe CLI but I am under the impression it works the same way. I have a Chinese Wall in between my IDE and the CLI so I'm mostly using the IDE for my own review and tinkering.\n\nAs a general approach, I try to create a Reason-Act agent pattern on a bigger scale. I create a constitution for the project, describing what the project is doing, why, what the tech stack is. Then I 'discuss' the entire project with my LLM to get to a point where I am confident that the model's semantic understanding is in line with mine. This coincidentally pushes the 'model' to think more and lay out a specific architecture as well as catch things I missed which I then sign off on.\n\nIf my [AGENTS.md](http://AGENTS.md) file, style guide, [ARCHITECTURE.md](http://ARCHITECTURE.md) file, unit tests, and any other supplementary plans are in good shape then the project can 'go'. Coincidentally, the coding LLMs are great at reviewing these documents as well.\n\n\"Yes.\" \"Yes.\" \"Yes.\" \"No change this.\" \"Yes.\" \"Yes.\"\n\nThe coding agent then does a huge portion of the project faster than I could do it, and in many cases better than I could do it. \n\nMake sure to insist on modularity so the whole thing doesn't break at once, effective version control so that you can roll things back, triple check relevant security issues, etc.\n\nThe model WILL make mistakes all the time, but it can also establish its own test driven development cycle in which it is immediately proceeding to fix those mistakes.",

Just had to clear up a few mistakes and off we go. \n\nThis is the same store every time I use mistral. Also with coding, less complex tasks etc. \n\nit forgets or doesn’t understand explicitly. \n\nI have the “pro” paid version of both chats. What the fuck am I doing wrong?

Is this normal? I tell it not to and correct it of course, however when you straight out ask it if it can draw info. From another chat, it tells you it can't and each chat is self-contained. Very odd?",

But I'd prefer to pay to Mistral directly omitting the providers.\n\nThanks!",
