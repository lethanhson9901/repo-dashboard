I have tried Devstral from Opencode but at some point I needed to get work done. I think it can handle a lot of the implementation but the competition is just easier to work with it seems.\n\nAt the same time I am happy to see Mistral Vibe BUT the documentation is either very limited or very hard to find. I came to the conclusion it is incomplete. I may be wrong. For example, I know Vibe supports skills because I saw the release notes but try finding the documentation on it.\n\nIn general I  do not think it reasonable to expect people to beta test a product (Vibe) that is lagging behind on the competition so much.\n\nWhat would keep me trying Vibe and Devstral is being able to use it free, daily or weekly limits are reasonable to impose, until it has caught up more to the competition.\n\nSo please consider making the Devstral models (limited) free on Mistral Vibe.  \n(I do not know what is technically possible given the trouble Claude Code is having limiting the subscription model to Claude Code only but a clear TOS from the help may help.)\n\nThis way I could keep on using (and testing) both.",

The solution? **A single environment variable.**\n\n**Debugging a Memory Leak in vLLM**\n\nA few months ago, one of our teams investigated a suspected memory leak in **vLLM**.

      "text": "Hi all, \n\n  \nI'm getting ready to start a new and large web development project. I am currently using Codex from OpenAI and sometimes, I'd switch to Claude Code. I am doing all my coding straight into MS Code, using the terminal and the agents mentioned. \n\nI'd very much like to use a European service, instead of sending money to Fascistan but I am a bit confused about MistralAI. I see it offers a free tier and then it costs X amount per million tokens, through the API. \n\nIn the past I've had some issues with this, as I don't know when to stop and overspent. So things like Codex or Claude Code that only work for X amount of time are perfect for me. Is there a similar thing that Mistral offers? \n\nMany thanks. ",

Depends, definitely not for professional scenarios with brownfield projects, Claude Opus 4.5 is unbeatable at the moment in this regards and Sonnet 4.5 as well GPT 5.2 Codex follow closely, even Gemini 3 Pro does a good job. Unfortunately it's also to expensive, I have a Github Copilot Plan an you get a lot out of 40 Euro per Month, vs. a few Devstral 2 sessions can cost much more and lead to much less, because it has zero caching at the moment. However, I think Mistral could catch up if they don't waste to much time on tool building but instead focus on improving their model just like DeepSeek and the Chinese competition like GLM does. I personally use OpenCode these days, it just works, no need for Vibe CLI.\n\nEDIT: I see that I haven't been charged for Devstral usage for a long time, is it still free? I thought it's just free in December.  \nEDIT2: Yes it is: [https://docs.mistral.ai/models/devstral-2-25-12](https://docs.mistral.ai/models/devstral-2-25-12) So I'm going to use it more, since I think the biggest advantage is that is blazingly fast and if it's free that's ideal for subagent tasks.",

I tried changing the npm config value from \"openai-compatible\" to \"mistral\"and using a blank api key as its on my own machine, but I still get the error below. If anyone has fixed this issue could you please let me know what you did to fix it. Thanks. \n\n`Error: The edit tool was called with invalid arguments: [`\n\n  `{`\n\n`\"expected\": \"string\",`\n\n`\"code\": \"invalid_type\",`\n\n`\"path\": [`\n\n`\"filePath\"`\n\n`],`\n\n`\"message\": \"Invalid input: expected string, received undefined\"`\n\n  `},`\n\n  `{`\n\n`\"expected\": \"string\",`\n\n`\"code\": \"invalid_type\",`\n\n`\"path\": [`\n\n`\"oldString\"`\n\n`],`\n\n`\"message\": \"Invalid input: expected string, received undefined\"`\n\n  `},`\n\n  `{`\n\n`\"expected\": \"string\",`\n\n`\"code\": \"invalid_type\",`\n\n`\"path\": [`\n\n`\"newString\"`\n\n`],`\n\n`\"message\": \"Invalid input: expected string, received undefined\"`\n\n  `}`\n\n`].`\n\n`Please rewrite the input so it satisfies the expected schema.`",

      "text": "I'm completely new to Mistral AI, but got the pro version yesterday as the student plan is extremely cheap. \n\nI'm transitioning from chatGPT to this, so I might be comparing too much here, but Le Chat seems so buggy. Im sorry, I dont have screenshots, but my very first prompt I asked \"do you speak Danish?\" (In Danish) And the prompt showed up \"do you speak _\". Now it clearly understood, because it answered as expected. But the ui had removed some of the prompt? \n\nWeird, but I continued the conversation. Now I got a pretty good answer, but almost every paragraph was stopped just short of the ending of the phrase. So I had to guess the last few words in every few sentences. \n\nSame thing today, i ask something, get a great answer but there the ends are cut off. Today i asked about a timeline, which the chat put into a table for me. But all of the years were 199 or 201 instead of 199x and 201x something. \n\nDoes anyone else notice this? \nIm starting to not like using the app. I havent noticed this in the web version. ",
