      "text": "As far as I know, Le Chat uses Black Forest Labs' image generation models, but in the last few days I've noticed a significant improvement in quality. It's most noticeable in the text displayed on screen, but also in the realism. I've included some images with their respective prompts here. Some of the prompts I copied from user u/uniquegyanee in the r/GenAIGallery subreddit; the rest are mine.\n\n1. A close-up, hyper-realistic photograph of a tiny artist sitting on a stool on a giant table and painting a Mona Lisa on a giant human fingernail of a a woman's finger resting on the table. The miniature painter holds a round palette and a thin brush, carefully recreating the soft lighting and detailed brushwork of the classic masterpiece. The nail surface is smooth and glossy, and the background is softly blurred to emphasize the intricate scene.\n\n[u\\/uniquegyanee](https://preview.redd.it/oav165atjt9g1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e9f097364c3315432b7fdce71bd4af99b078621b)\n\n  \n2. A hand-painted classic-style plastic wargaming miniature of a powerful sorceress, master of fire. She is wearing an intricate orange robe and holds a staff with a flickering flame at its tip. Her hair is depicted as living flames, adding to her mystical and fierce appearance. The miniature is set against a plain white background, mounted on a black plastic base, showcasing detailed paintwork and textures typical of tabletop gaming miniatures.\n\n[Original](https://preview.redd.it/9en4xshnkt9g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6e9459a1d459fea211c43f01e3cc3e8e79fc8b8)\n\n  \n3. A hand-painted plastic miniature of a fierce orc with green skin and prominent fangs, standing in a threatening pose. The orc's body is covered in old battle scars, adding to its menacing appearance. It holds a large axe with both hands, ready for battle. The miniature is set against a plain white background, mounted on a black plastic base, showcasing the detailed paintwork and textures typical of tabletop gaming miniatures.\n\n[Original](https://preview.redd.it/6gy51kwwkt9g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=331725924f93f23c3e81293d743a8e652b9adf51)\n\n  \n4. A hand-painted classic-style plastic wargaming miniature of a powerful, piloted, bipedal combat mech. The mech is a heavy robot with fearsome details, featuring energy cannons for arms, reinforced armor plating, and a menacing stance. The paintwork is detailed, with weathering effects and a realistic color scheme that highlights its mechanical complexity. The miniature is set against a plain white background, mounted on a black plastic base, showcasing the intricate details typical of tabletop gaming miniatures.\n\n[Original](https://preview.redd.it/ary8i1c3lt9g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=a521bace28076f98a4cdf32742ce4b1afba1de76)\n\n  \n5. A colossal, futuristic obelisk monument inspired by the design of a smartphone, standing in the center of a bustling city plaza. The monument features sleek, reflective surfaces with realistic wear, scratches, and dust, emphasizing its massive scale. People and vehicles at the base provide a sense of its enormous size. The scene is captured from a low-angle cinematic perspective, with realistic daylight casting shadows and highlighting the ultra-detailed textures of the metal and glass materials. The surrounding environment includes modern skyscrapers and a vibrant urban atmosphere.\n\n[u\\/uniquegyanee](https://preview.redd.it/xwrebcvllt9g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=17b853cee1d709f65cd40700c46944bd2a93beae)\n\n  \n6. A hyper-realistic cinematic movie poster of a powerful female sorcerer, bursting through a cracked Queen of Spades playing card. The card explodes outward with stone fragments, dust, and debris frozen mid-air. She wears an ornate royal maroon and gold embroidered medieval fantasy jacket, rich fabric textures, intricate detailing, regal and mystical.The sorcerer extends one hand forward toward the viewer, fingers glowing with intense magical energy, subtle golden sparks and dark arcane aura surrounding the hand. Intense piercing gaze, confident and dominant expression, cinematic hero framing. Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting, dark moody background, volumetric light rays, ultra-detailed textures, shallow cinematic depth of field. Photorealistic face, epic fantasy realism, movie poster composition, high contrast, dynamic motion, dust particles, masterpiece quality, ultra-sharp focus, 8K resolution, cinematic color grading.\n\n[u\\/uniquegyanee](https://preview.redd.it/zfqfqpbbnt9g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a8c1d7c12433ea1568264d968fb79da128d6ce4)\n\n  \n7. And this one is a little different. From image to image:\n\nTransform this illustrated character into a realistic live-action version. Maintain the white background and ensure the image is in high definition.\n\n[Original](https://preview.redd.it/ef80jf2rmt9g1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=f82c0d96479839fda1f47c2864c1ce6f3062862e)\n\n",

ChatGPT also let's you create agents, but agents work much better on le chat, also with libraries. Like I wanted to ask chatGPT to create images of me, in a cartoon style, but anytime I had to upload 10 photos so that it would konw me. With Le chat, I just tell it to use the library!",

It loves break downs, bullet points, follow-up questions at the end, and \"It's not X, it's Y\" and its numerous permutations (this is one I especially wish I could stop). Like other Mistral models, it will invariably end up ignoring any instructions to avoid these habits, even given alternatives.\n\nI'm generally happy with its writing in the context of a story, but there's always room for improvement. Story stalling is probably my biggest gripe when it comes to it writing, repetition second.",

The small models (creative or just latest) are both worse than medium at this.\n\nI'm using some planner agents to try and create richer outlines for the prose generator to use, and that helps a little bit, but no matter the model, I think I have to do even more planning and guidance to get better and more coherent long form stories.",

If you give them hidden trauma, hidden motives, or hidden twists, they will use it immediately because generalist models tend to push the story toward resolutions as fast as possible.  \nSo keep your character sheet minimal: public facts only.  \nAnything the LLM discovers *in-scene*, you can later add to your sheet.\n\n**About them meeting as strangers:**  \nNo problem at all.  \nOnly write what the rest of the characters really know, should be able to observe or infer.  \nAs the story progresses, you can update the sheet with things that become public or discovered naturally.\n\n**Checkpoints / Plot**  \nYour checkpoint method is great. I use something similar, but per chapter.  \nJust one important thing:  \nCreate checkpoints after the event has happened, not before.  \nIf you announce “In this chapter X will happen”, the LLM will accelerate the scene unnaturally to force that outcome.  \nIf you wait until the scene is done, then write the checkpoint, you get continuity without railroading.\n\nThis isn’t a Le Chat issue; it’s a general LLM behavior.  \nModels try to “close the loop” as soon as they see the target.  \nThe good thing is that Le Chat tends to feel less nanny and more willing to play along, so you’ll get nicer organic twists than in other platforms.  \n  \n**Stylebook / Rules / Setting**  \nYour RP rules look great.  \nAnd yes: if you have anything about setting, location, mood, red lines, boundaries, put it there too.  \nAll that helps the model stay consistent.\n\nYou’re on the right track 😊",

Such low limit just seems really unusable for any production grade app.\n\nThey mention that this limits scales on demand, but what does it mean? Will I need to write to mistral every time I start getting near the limit? What if I will get sudden surge of 6 new users? Will I have to wait until they respond to my scale-up demand?",

I did not find any exact numbers for the rate limits on the page you posted.\n\nAlso how long on average does it take for Mistral support to approve a scale-up request? \n\nWe are just a small startup, not a large enterprise. Do we have any guarantee at all that our scale-up requests would be approved? If not, then I find it risky to use Mistral in production at all. Imagine that we will build our AI infra on Mistral and they would reject or ignore our scale up requests. We would have to rewrite all of our AI code to use some other LLM while our users would get their requests throttled or even rejected.",

Mon objectif : pouvoir créer des issues, milestones, et générer des documents en discutant dans AI Studio.\n\n\n\nJ’ai déjà essayé plusieurs approches :\n\n* Ngrok + FastAPI : n'a pas fonctionné \"Je ne peux pas interagir directement avec l'API Linear ou ton serveur FastAPI depuis ici.\"\n* Tines : j’ai réussi à connecter Linear via webhook et à créer des actions, mais l’IA ne peut pas déclencher directement ces actions depuis AI Studio.\n\n\n\nJe cherche donc une solution idéalement gratuite, où AI Studio pourrait directement interagir avec Linear (API) ou un système simple de webhook/action.\n\nAvez-vous des idées ? \n\n\n\nMerci d’avance pour vos retours !",

Je pense que c'est l'option la plus flexible. Contrôle total sur le model/system prompt/température etc. Tu peux même partir sur une API OpenRouter pour avoir accès à tous les models et comparer en fonction de tes besoins. Mais sinon sur AI Studio, tu peux aussi créer des agents à déployer sur Le Chat et choisir le model Mistral a utiliser pour l'agent (ainsi que la temp et le system prompt, mais tu auras toujours le system prompt du Chat en plus de celui personnalisé je crois).",
