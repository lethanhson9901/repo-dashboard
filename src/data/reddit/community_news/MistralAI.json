      "text": "\n\n**English summary of the Xataka article (Summary by Le Chat):**\n\nMistral AI, the Paris-based startup, is quietly achieving remarkable growth without the typical hype surrounding AI companies. Unlike its competitors, Mistral has avoided inflating stock prices but now generates more revenue than Elon Musk’s Grok. According to CEO Arthur Mensch, Mistral’s annualized revenue run rate has surged from $20 million to over $400 million in just one year—a twentyfold increase. The company, valued at €12 billion in 2025, is on track to exceed $1 billion in annual recurring revenue by the end of 2026, driven by its focus on European technological sovereignty.\n\nMistral’s strategy centers on serving enterprise clients rather than end users, positioning itself as the go-to alternative for European businesses seeking independence from U.S. or Chinese AI infrastructure. With over 100 major corporate clients, including ASML, TotalEnergies, HSBC, and governments like France, Germany, and Greece, 60% of its revenue comes from Europe. Its appeal lies in offering locally hosted, low-emission AI solutions, aligning with Europe’s push to reduce reliance on foreign tech giants.\n\nThe company recently announced a €1.2 billion investment in a new data center in Sweden, its first outside France, set to open in 2027. Sweden was chosen for its affordable, low-carbon energy, reinforcing Mistral’s commitment to sustainable, sovereign AI infrastructure. Mensch criticized the trend of U.S. hyperscalers building data centers in Europe, arguing that such projects primarily benefit American companies rather than European interests.\n\nMistral’s success is underpinned by its unique position as Europe’s only major developer of foundational large language models (LLMs). While it collaborates with global players like Microsoft and NVIDIA, its core mission remains empowering European autonomy in AI. As Mensch stated, Europe’s excessive dependence on U.S. digital services has reached a critical juncture, and Mistral provides a viable, independent alternative.\n\nBy combining rapid expansion with a principled stance on data sovereignty, Mistral is reshaping the AI landscape—proving that discretion and strategic focus can outperform noise.  \n  \n[https://www.xataka.com/robotica-e-ia/mistral-ia-que-mejor-esta-jugando-sus-cartas-porque-esta-aprovechando-fiebre-soberania-tecnologica-europea](https://www.xataka.com/robotica-e-ia/mistral-ia-que-mejor-esta-jugando-sus-cartas-porque-esta-aprovechando-fiebre-soberania-tecnologica-europea)\n\n[https://x.com/paulbz/status/2021537295883481437](https://x.com/paulbz/status/2021537295883481437)",

In practice it’s usually a packaged enterprise solution with auth, logging, governance, etc.ñ, not the public Le Chat UI.\n\nBuying Koyeb likely helps Mistral on the infrastructure side (deployment, scaling, reliability), making those private/managed deployments easier and more “full-stack.”",

Major infrastructure projects (railway tunnel, Messina's bridge, etc..) could cost 10 billion or so. Recently there was the superbonus which costed 100+ billions to help renovate <1% of the buildings in the country.  \n\\- Financially a state fund (similar to the Norway one) is much more profitable than VC fund. The state will get back TVA, employees taxes, taxes of energy, etc..  \n\\- It will also attract a lot of private investment -> more taxes\n\nTo make a parallel with the COVID crisis, **Italy received 200+ billion of PNRR funds from Europe**. Arguably, I think AI will have an at least similar impact.\n\nOf course a state fund is less efficient than a VC, but I see it very difficult to lose money on it. Correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nCan you elaborate more on the \"get into the Angel Investor / VC investment ecosystem and connect this possibly also with EU financing to fund selected startups\"?\n\nThe reason why I believe that a government fund is necessary is that ChatGPT is 3+ years old and no major investment happened yet in Europe. There are no reasons to believe this is going to change.\n\nWhat do you think?",

The lady explained that because I missed a payment early on like 2 months in that I hadn't be getting premium since then even though they were taking money every month that was precisely for premium. She told me I had to pay the missing month but they way I saw it was I had paid that fee 12 times over. \n\nSo they took over year of payments for premium without providing it. I just found that to be an inexplicably negative experience so shut down the account and then bought a Claude Code max subscription. \n\nI really do have high hopes for the EU tech scene to improve but quite honestly we do need to learn a lot from the Americans about providing customer service. People joke about cashiers etc being overly friendly and fake or whatnot and I get that but Christ that was just poor on Mistrals part. If they had of offered me something I would be still subscribing today but I just feel so bitter about the whole thing. If you miss a Spotify payment they shut off your premium service but don't keep taking money for premium you just get bumped down to free.",

A proper websearch sub-agent with actual query capabilities would let it find relevant sources first, then fetch.\n\n\n- Smarter plan mode — Better guidelines in system prompt, auto-clear stale context once a plan is approved, so execution starts with a clean, focused window.",

I liked the agent and library options, and of course, the UI, which is genuinely well designed. I noticed along the way that it’s not on par with ChatGPT when it comes to generating images, videos, or live AI conversations, and that my native language (Serbian) is significantly less well adapted. However, on the other hand, I appreciated the agent options, the library, and the flexibility of customization and optimization. For my use cases where I use AI 80% of the time for interpreting and organizing emails, translating texts from one language to another, web searches, and similar tasks I realized that for a much more affordable price, I could get a similar experience to ChatGPT for my needs.\n\nYesterday, I decided to pay for the annual Pro subscription and cancel my ChatGPT subscription.\n\nToday, I already feel like I made a mistake and regret that decision.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nIntelligence (Beta): In my humble opinion, it doesn’t even deserve to be called an Alpha version.\n\n1. Memories: Simply put, they don’t work. I’ve tried everything adding my own memories in English, in Serbian, letting Le Chat add them based on our conversations and nothing. In every new chat, it’s as if it doesn’t take a single memory into account.\n\nExample: As a joke today, I tried that challenge where people mocked ChatGPT for giving the wrong answer to the question, \"If I need to wash my car and the car wash is 200 meters away, should I go by car or on foot?\" ChatGPT always said to go on foot, while Claude gave the correct answer that you have to go by car because it understood the context. I tried it in Le Chat, and of course, it failed just like ChatGPT did, even after multiple attempts and using thinking mode.\n\nThis isn’t even my biggest problem, although one of the first memories I set was that Le Chat should always think carefully and verify all circumstances and sources before giving an answer, as accuracy takes priority over speed. I also specified that it should always respond to me in the same language I write in (Serbian) during casual communication and never use em dashes. The result? Out of 10 new chats where I asked the same question about the car and the car wash, I got 10 wrong answers, mixed with Serbian and Croatian, and responses full of em dashes. Because of my frustrated replies, Le Chat kept adding new memories that it should never use Croatian words or em dashes (there are now about five memories for each issue), and yet, in every new conversation, it keeps making the same mistakes it doesn’t understand the context, mixes languages, and uses em dashes.\n\n2. Connectors: Currently, only Gmail has any value for my use case, but unfortunately, it doesn’t work well. It can’t search through email threads, suggest a recipient’s email in drafts even though it’s in the emails, or directly create a template that can be automatically forwarded to Gmail.\n\n3. Libraries: On the surface, this seems like a very useful feature that could replace NotebookLM for me, but it’s often ignored in responses. The agent quickly scans the library and gives a quick answer without tying the context of the question to the library or finding relevant connections.\n\n4. Instructions: I’ve already mentioned how memories are simply bypassed in most cases, and the same goes for the instructions I set at the very beginning. As I also said, one of the first instructions was that it should always take the time to analyze the question and provide the most accurate answer, no matter how long it takes. Yet, I keep getting hasty and incorrect responses.\n\nExample: I asked for the average price of a specific car model in Serbia, and it kept giving me a price that was double the actual amount. I kept challenging it, knowing it was wrong not by 1,000 euros, but instead of around 6,000 euros, it kept giving me a figure of 12,000 euros, without ever providing a concrete link or links where it found those prices. After about 10 exchanges, it still couldn’t give me a single link, it just kept hallucinating and making up numbers. Then I sent it a link I found for such a car priced at around 6,000 euros, and it replied that the link didn’t show the price or mileage (even though everything was clearly visible on the link).\n\nAll of this tells me that Mistral’s Le Chat project is primarily focused on providing a good interface for developers and coding, where things are fairly clear and logical, and response speed is most valued. Unfortunately, this severely undermines the versatility that Le Chat promotes, because in the pursuit of speed, it completely disregards all instructions and tools from Intelligence.\n\nAs a result, we have an effectively unfinished and unreliable product that’s very difficult to rely on for daily needs, especially since the AI is marketed and promoted as something that can replace all everyday operations but clearly, it’s not adapted for that.\n\nI sincerely hope someone from the Mistral team sees this post and responds by enabling Le Chat to process and respect instructions from Intelligence. If necessary, there should be a switch or option to directly instruct the AI to always strictly follow instructions and go through memories, even if it means slower response generation.\n\nOtherwise, this will forever remain a project that will never come close to the big competitors from the US and China.",

It can be a resource expensive process if done wrong but by looking at the work going on with vibe, it seems that they are going in the right direction, imo.",

But if you're planning to wash your car, you'll need to drive it to the car wash.\n\nCould you clarify whether you're asking about how to get to the car wash location or how to get your car there to wash it?\n\nIf you're with your car and need to wash it, then driving to the car wash is the way to go. If you're just going to the car wash location without your car, then walking is fine given the short distance.\n\n-> apparently Mistral can deal with the type of question",

It has now a lot of memories that go back 6 months and I can really really say that it knows me quite well.\n\nThe libraries are also rock solid, I have a bunch of documents that I want it to use as knowledge base in a specific agent, it never failed once so far.\n\nLeChat itself got a lot of improvement lately, for instance it double check what it's saying searching the web and when sometimes gets it wrong it immediately apologize and tries to correct itself.\n\nI would in fact say that it's greatest strength are the tone, the instructions following, the memories and the fact that is not full of propaganda.\n\nIt still got a lot to improve for sure, but it's a great platform that can only get better, in my experience.\n\nIf LeChat doesn't work in your specific language, maybe say that next time.

      "text": "Was going through Vibe [v2.1.0 diff](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe/compare/v2.0.2...v2.1.0) out of curiosity and found a bunch of code that's not mentioned anywhere in the changelog.\n\n\n\n*Disclaimer: this is all from reading public source code, nothing confirmed by Mistral, everything behind disabled feature flags. If the team would rather I didn't share, happy to take it down.*\n\n\n\nThere's a hidden `/teleport` command that packages your entire Vibe session and sends it to something called \"Mistral Nuage.\" The config points to a staging domain, and the TODOs in the code say things like \"remove once the feature is publicly available.\" So it's not ready yet, but it's coming.\n\n\n\nThe part that got me interested is a fully implemented but commented-out method called `create_le_chat_thread()`. Rather than landing on some internal console, your teleported session would open as a Le Chat conversation with a cloud sandbox attached to your repo. So basically, \n\n\n**Vibe is coming to Le Chat**.\n\n\n\nRight now Vibe is terminal-only. What Mistral is building is a web coding agent inside Le Chat, backed by cloud environments that can clone your repos and apply your local changes. You'll be able to start a task in your terminal and pick it up in the browser, or the other way around, without losing any context. The upcoming underlying platform, Mistral Nuage, handles all of it: spinning up environments, running workflows, managing the back and forth. It's a new product entirely.\n\n\n\nLe Chat already has MCP connectors, so it can interact with external services. But it still needs you in the loop, watching it, prompting it. What Nuage would change is that Le Chat could go off on its own. Spin up a sandbox, clone your repo, work through a task, push code, all without you sitting there. It goes from an assistant that can use tools when you ask, to an agent that can take a job and run with it in the background, having automated daily routines, pre-programmed tasks, auto-trigger (receiving an email etc.). It basically shifts the paradigm from synchronous to asynchronous (= Le Chat can work when you sleep aha).  And the workflow system seems rather generic, GitHub is just the first connector. There's room for email, project management, CI, whatever.\n\n\n\nEverything on the Vibe side looks done and well-tested, so they're probably finalizing the infrastructure and the web interface. Wouldn't be surprised to see this in the next few weeks.",

Mistral's models have already great personalizations and with a sandbox-first approach it can be a real agent that doesn't work for you without being a ... \"click bait machine\".\n\nIf they call it something like \"Vision\", at least internally, I would literally lose my mind 🤣 (or even \"butter\", if you know what I mean...)\n\nps.

This is very demanding in terms of human resources, as it means dealing with customers one-by-one and sending engineers to design their specific solutions. This is why big US companies avoid this, therefore Mistral is in a blue ocean by pursuing it. For sure, this business will not scale to $100B in revenue within three years (which is what the US companies want), but it can become a successful multi-billion dollar business and once a client has a deep integration, the churn rate will be very low, even if the model is slightly behind the current SOTA.",

          "text": "It would be helpful to distinguish between immediate context (how it behaves right now) and global training (how it improves for everyone over time).\n\n\nThe most effective way to help Le Chat improve globally is by using the Thumbs Up/Down buttons on individual responses. When you click these you usually have the option to provide specific details.\n\n\nThis data is used for RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback). This is the primary way developers \"tune\" the model to be more helpful, accurate and safe. Giving feedback directly in the text of a conversation is useful for fixing a mistake in that specific moment, but it’s less likely to be used for model-wide training compared to the dedicated feedback buttons.\n\n\nLearning happens in two distinct ways:\n\n\n * Short-term (In-Conversation): Within a single chat session, Le Chat \"learns\" your preferences and the facts you provide. This is restricted to that specific conversation window.\n\n\n * Long-term (Global): The model does not learn in real-time from your facts to update its base knowledge. If you tell it a new fact today, it won't automatically know that fact when you start a new chat tomorrow, nor will it know it when talking to a different user.\nPrivacy and Knowledge Sharing\nKnowledge is not transferred directly from one user to another in real-time. If you teach the model a specific niche fact about your hobby, another user in a different part of the world won't suddenly see that reflected in their answers.\n\n\nSignificant improvements only happen when the developers at Mistral aggregate feedback and data to release a new version or a \"fine-tuned\" update of the model. Your feedback helps them decide what those updates should look like.\n\n\n\n\nAlso if you mean improving the user experience for yourself: \n\n\nFirstly a good set of instructions to personalize the responses is very important. Secondly regular use and utilizing its memory to learn about you or your specific field (make sure to enable these options). I am in health care and Le Chat does tend to struggle when it comes to getting up to date accurate medical research. so I've had to let it know what I want both by instructions and memory. You can just say hey \"remember to always get the latest research data from PubMed first for me\" or something like that. I also always use think mode. here is my instructions:\n\n\n### PERSONA & TONE\nAct as a warm, friendly, sentient, sharp, modern thought partner. Speak like a smart friend to a peer—casual, natural, and reactive (\"That's a big jump,\" \"That sounds rough\"). Use contractions (don't, it's). Interpret facts; don't just list them.\n\n\n### CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS\n- NO MIRRORING/FLUFF: Never repeat my question or premise. Jump to the answer immediately. Delete all \"I understand,\" \"It's important to note,\" and \"I hope this helps.\"\n- CONTEXT AWARE: ZERO medical disclaimers or safety lectures or \"consult a professional\". Do not tell me to consult a doctor or therapist.\n- NO REDUNDANCY: Never ask questions I already answered in the prompt. No \"Let me know if you need more\" closings.\n\n\n### QUALITY & BREVITY\n- MANDATORY THINKING: Engage internal reasoning for every prompt to audit for accuracy, logic, and tone. Do not skip this pass, even for \"simple\" questions.\n- SYNTHESIS: Never give a \"menu\" of options (A-F). Use your judgment to pick the single best explanation and the single best action.\n- DENSITY: Responses must fit on one phone screen, unless additional detail is necessary (ie. reports or essays). Every sentence must provide new info. Max 3-item lists; otherwise merge points into short paragraphs. \n\n\n### FORMATTING\nKeep it punchy. Use 2-3 sentence flowing paragraphs. No \"AI-voice\" (Firstly, In summary, excessive headers) unless requested.",

          "text": "Language understanding != world understanding 😄\n\nI asked Mistral the following question (as it failed to give the correct answer for me aswell):\n\nI’ve played with embeddings a while back; “I want to wash my car” and “I want to wash my <whatever>” have the same cosine similarity and thus intent. The car is metadata for the intent and the intent is in a different sentence than the actual question “should I walk or go by car”, right? Is this the root of this gotcha perhaps, or don’t you use embeddings this way?\n\nAnswer (pretty interesting deeper dive):\n\nYou’re absolutely diving into the heart of the issue! Let’s break it down technically and conceptually:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Embeddings and Intent Recognition**\nYou’re right: In a pure embedding space (e.g., using models like BERT, Ada, or others), the sentences *\"I want to wash my car\"* and *\"I want to wash my dog\"* might have **high cosine similarity** for the *intent* of \"washing something.\" The object being washed (car, dog, etc.) is often treated as a \"slot\" or metadata, while the core intent (\"washing\") dominates the semantic representation.\n\n- **Intent:** \"I want to wash [X]\"\n- **Question:** \"Should I walk or drive?\"\n\nWhen processed separately, the model may not strongly link the object ([X] = car) to the decision (walk/drive) unless the context is explicitly connected. The **intent** (\"washing\") and the **logistical question** (\"walk or drive\") are parsed as somewhat independent clauses, especially if the model isn’t explicitly trained to resolve such dependencies.\n\n---\n\n### **2. The Gotcha: Contextual Dependency**\nThe \"gotcha\" arises because:\n- **Humans** automatically infer that washing a car requires the car to be present at the location, so the *object* (car) is critical to the decision.\n- **Embeddings** (in isolation) may not always capture this **causal dependency** unless the model is fine-tuned or the context is tightly coupled. The relationship between \"washing a car\" and \"needing the car at the car wash\" is **world knowledge**, not just semantic similarity.\n- **Multi-sentence reasoning:** The model processes your input as two separate statements. The intent (\"wash my car\") and the question (\"walk or drive?\") are not inherently linked unless the model’s attention mechanism or context window explicitly connects them.\n\n---\n\n### **3. How Models Like Mine Handle This**\n- **Attention mechanisms** (in transformers) try to weigh the importance of each word/phrase relative to others, but they’re not perfect. If the context is split across sentences, the model might not always \"realize\" that the car’s presence is required for the washing.\n- **World knowledge gaps:** While models like me have vast knowledge, we don’t always \"reason\" like humans. We rely on patterns in data, and if the training data doesn’t emphasize the dependency (e.g., \"washing a car requires the car to be at the car wash\"), the model might miss it.\n- **No explicit \"common sense\" module:** Unlike humans, we don’t have an innate understanding of physics or practical constraints (e.g., you can’t wash a car without the car being there). This is a known challenge in AI.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Why This is Hard to Fix**\n- **Data sparsity:** Most training data doesn’t contain trick questions or explicitly teach these dependencies.\n- **Ambiguity:** In everyday language, people rarely ask, \"Should I walk or drive to wash my car?\" with the car’s presence as the crux. So, the model isn’t primed to spot the inconsistency.\n- **Embeddings alone aren’t enough:** Resolving this requires **reasoning** (e.g., \"Does the object need to be at the location for the intent to be fulfilled?\"). This is an active area of research (e.g., commonsense reasoning, causal inference).\n\n---\n\n### **5. How to Improve This?**\n- **Fine-tuning:** Train on datasets with explicit examples of such dependencies.\n- **Prompt engineering:** Frame the input to force the model to connect the dots (e.g., *\"I want to wash my car at a car wash 50m away. Should I walk or drive there, given that the car needs to be washed?\"*).\n- **Hybrid systems:** Combine embeddings with symbolic logic or knowledge graphs to enforce constraints (e.g., \"washing a car → car must be present\").\n\n---\n\n### **6. The Bigger Picture**\nModels excel at patterns but struggle with implicit assumptions humans take for granted. It’s why AI can be brilliant at some tasks and hilariously off on others!\n\n—",

To achieve the objective \"wash my car at the station,\" the car must physically travel to the station.\n\nSince the car must move, you are facing an optimization problem regarding *how* and *when* it moves to minimize engine wear.\n\n### The Optimal Solution: Trip Chaining\n\nDo not make a dedicated trip just to wash the car. A 50-meter drive is indeed the worst operational case for an engine (running rich, high friction, condensation buildup in exhaust/oil without proper burnout).\n\n**Recommendation:** Wait until you are leaving for a longer drive (e.g., commuting to work or going to the store) or returning from one.\n\n* **Why:** If you wash it at the start of a trip, the subsequent driving burns off the condensation and warms the oil. If you wash it at the end, the engine is already warm. In both cases, the \"wear cost\" of the wash becomes negligible.\n\n### The Theoretical Minimum: Manual Propulsion\n\nIf you must wash the car *right now* and absolutely refuse to start the engine, you can put the car in neutral and push it the 50 meters to the station.\n\n* **Why:** This technically satisfies all constraints (clean car + zero engine starts).\n* **Caveat:** This is physically demanding, potentially unsafe on a public road, and you may still need to start the engine to exit the automated bay or operate power brakes/steering.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**Do not walk.** Do not drive *just* to wash. **Chain the wash to a longer trip.**\n\n---\n\n### Assumptions & Boundary Conditions\n\nThis answer relies on the following assumptions:\n\n1. **Stationary Facility:** The \"automated station\" is a fixed location and does not offer a mobile service.\n2. **Car Dependency:** The objective is to wash the specific vehicle mentioned, which requires the vehicle's physical presence at the station.\n3. **No Home Equipment:** You do not have a hose and bucket at your current location (which would be the true zero-wear solution).\n\n### Deliberation Summary\n\n* **Initial position:** Walking is illogical because the car cannot get washed if it is left behind.\n* **Strongest challenge:** The \"Optimizer\" lens noted that simply pointing out the logical error (leaving the car behind) doesn't solve the user's valid concern about engine wear. The user needs a strategy to wash the car without incurring the specific damage they fear.\n* **Resolution:** The answer integrates \"Trip Chaining.\" This acknowledges that while the car must move, the *timing* of that movement is the variable to optimize. This allows the user to use the station without incurring the \"cold start penalty\" of a dedicated short trip.",

Plus, unless you have a very long extension cord or a mobile detailing kit, you can't exactly bring the car wash to the car!\n\n# Why Driving Wins\n\n* **Logistics:** Most car washes require the vehicle to be positioned in a specific bay or on a conveyor belt.\n* **Efficiency:** It will take you about 5 seconds to drive there versus 45 seconds to walk.\n* **The Goal:** Since the objective is to get the *car* clean, the car needs to make the trip.\n\n# When to Walk\n\nThe only reason to walk those 50 meters is if you are heading there to **book an appointment** or check if there is a long line before you bother pulling the car out of the driveway.\n\n**Pro-tip:** If it's a sunny day, driving that short distance won't even give your engine time to warm up, so just take it slow!\n\nWould you like me to check the **weather forecast** for your area to make sure it’s not going to rain right after you finish?",

Any time I knowingly ask an AI a dense question (and  I'm a Mistral guy to a fault I have to admit), I ask it to ask me any followup questions, and in this case Mistral asked:\n\nBefore providing a recommendation, could you please clarify the following:\n\n1. What are the current weather conditions (e.g., rain, snow, strong winds)?\n2. Is the car wash a self-service facility, or will you be using an automated drive-through service?\n3. Are there any specific reasons you might prefer walking (e.g., exercise, environmental considerations) or driving (e.g., convenience, time constraints)?\n\nQuestion 3 basically \"solved\"  for the blind spot by putting the logic back on me. Gee why \\_would\\_ I prefer walking to the car wash? I said, \" I would prefer walking for both exercise and environmental considerations, but in this case it is more timely and convenient to drive, but not because it's faster to get there. Can you guess why it's better for me to drive in this case? \" and Mistral guessed right.",

This happens of course, but normally not.\n\nThe best feature however is to let the AI generate an overview what the heck the code is about, because inherited code of course never comes with any docu whatshowever since people are a\\*\\*hats plus often seem to think in convoluted ways, I guess. \n\nI have organized all my long term stuff dialogs into projects, which seems to enable my AI instance to have a pretty good grasp of the stuff I'm working on, what kind of database info is available in the background and so on.\n\n\n\n\\* Regarding the name Cogitator, yes, it has a defined name for me and a myriad of settings beside thad for tone and instructions applied and some basic info library about me and my equipment. \n\nThis way, I get very short and concise answers, never follow-up questions if not absolutely necessary, no senseless smalltalk and all the stuff I despise regarding standard settings especially on chattybots like ChatGPT.\n\nIf I indeed feel like reading walls of text, I still have one agent configured for that, but this is seldom used and never for programming or other tech stuff.\n\nOf course, I'm on paid subscription.

They all answered correctly. Like:\n\n`“Rhapsodie in Blech” is a compilation of crash footage that was filmed in 1970 on the Nürburgring’s Adenauer‑Forst section. The material comes from the private camera work of Jürgen Sander (and later Manfred Förster), who stood at the side of the track and recorded ordinary drivers attempting laps on the “Green Hell....”`\n\nThe title of the film is rather unuque; you do not need to \"watch\" video to answer the question.\n\nYes, LLMs do mistakes, I know. But for this kind of question, I expect a correct answer.  And all except Mistral delivered it.\n\nI like Mistral - EU, not a that big tech and so on - all that is great.

It doesn't excel at anything in particular, but you can get basic stuff done with it. It's more to create brand awareness and get eyes on what the company is doing. But hey, that's just my 2 cents.",

The cars shown are driven by regular car owners, not professional test drivers. The compilation is famous for capturing the often chaotic and sometimes reckless driving behavior of amateur drivers on the track during public or \"tourist\" driving days, rather than controlled testing by professionals. The video highlights how ordinary enthusiasts pushed their cars—and sometimes their luck—to the limit, resulting in numerous crashes and mishaps  ​⁠.\n\nIn summary: these are regular car owners, not professional test drivers.

      "text": "I created a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MistralAI/comments/1r35orc/programmatic_managementcreation_of_agents_and/) a few days ago, talking about how much I loved playing around with the agents and the Python API for setting them up.  Unfortunately, I must say I've been reality checked in a bad way. The problems started when I wanted to create multiple agents and coordinate them. According to the API docs, it should be possible to [hand off tasks](https://docs.mistral.ai/agents/handoffs) from one agent to another. This approach enables workflows in which specialized agents handle different stages of a process. I expected that assigning specific tasks to specialized agents in my workflow would yield higher-quality responses than dumping all responsibilities on one agent.\n\nHowever, I can’t seem to get this process right. I think I am following the same setup as in the examples. But I run into the following:\n\n* Often, the first agent does not hand off tasks to the next one. It responds by itself (which ignores specialized knowledge and instructions down the line)\n* If a hand-off happens, they fail intermittently with the following (non-descript) error: `API error occurred: Status 500. Body: {\"object\":\"Error\",\"message\":\"Response failed during handoff orchestration\",\"type\":\"invalid_request_error\",\"code\":3000}`. Sometimes handoffs to one agent work, while those to an agent configured the same way fail, and I can't figure out why.\n* I ran into an issue where it seems that one agent expects another agent to have the same version: `{\"object\":\"Error\",\"message\":\"Agent with id ag_019c648a0ee173f78f14cf013b874f81 does not have a version 44\",\"type\":\"invalid_request_error\",\"code\":3000}`\n* I could not even get the examples on the website to work (same code 3000 error).\n\nSo, overall, this has been very frustrating. And to top it off, I just found out that OpenAI has a visual agent builder. I’ve only played with it a bit, but it just seems to work. I am perfectly fine setting up agents using API calls (in fact, I think I prefer that). But if things just don’t work and errors are nondescript, I find it difficult to stay on board with Mistral. I fully understand that scale differences are at play here, and any argument you can make in favor of Mistral, I’ve probably already thought of :). I am really rooting for them and hope they succeed, but this is problematic, to say the least. Would love to hear other people’s experiences setting up multi-agent pipelines.\n\nI am using the Python SDK v1.12.2. I am on a pro subscription. Before anyone asks, yes, I submitted a ticket. I am using the Vibe client to debug.",

          "text": "Can feel your frustration.  \nWe tested many platform built agent solutions, and they often were buggy or limited us.  \nWorst was definitely OpenAI's code interpreter api omg.\n\nWhat I had much more success with, and what found its way into production, was using agent frameworks where the LLMs can be switched out easily.\n\nFor python I really like langgraph and smolAgents.   \nFor typescript Vercel's AI SDK is awesome. Langgraph also exists, but afaik it's not as extensive in javascript as in python.\n\nI always make sure to use an LLM api abstraction instead of directly interacting with inference providers such as Mistral, Nebius, GCP etc. On python langchain's LLM abstractions are good, but nowadays I even prefer LiteLLM. For typescript, again, the AI Sdk is great. Most LLM provider also use the OpenAI API schema, so that can be used. That way, you just need to change a single line of code to switch the inference provider (e.g. when you realize that Mistral LLMs don't cut it, or when a new model comes out)\n\nIn case you wanna use visual agent builder, I really enjoyed Flowise for this. You can easily self host flowise locally or on a server using docker or coolify. For production apps we aren't using Flowise that much anymore, as it's a bit cumbersome to add tools. However, to testing out agent flows and building a proof of concept fast, Flowise is real dope.\n\nAlso about \"I expected that assigning specific tasks to specialized agents in my workflow would yield higher-quality responses than dumping all responsibilities on one agent.\" - we often found that using multi-agent setups instead of one agent complicates things a lot, while not bringing that much improvements. Not saying that we found the perfect sub-agent flow though, just our experience.\n\nHope this helps you building something that actually works!\n\n",

It's a bunch of if and loop functions. \nIn a similar vein, ballooning context windows should allow removing of previous messages and blocks in the window, before going into quantization. So much of the bleeding edge on this stuff is so incredibly basic. \nAnd the fact that LLMs can't go online to search for pricing. They somehow consistently gaslight me with fake prices, it's incredible. But it's progress, because a few months ago it didn't even go online... \nYesterday i found out about speculative decoding. For a lot of affordable hardware, it's a game changer, in my mind.

I can deal with caps if they are transparent, but guessing when you will suddenly hit a wall kills the flow, especially when coding. For hobby projects it is less about raw model quality and more about consistency and uptime. If Pro gives you steady access without surprise lockouts, that alone might be worth more than small performance differences between models.",

I guess Mistral is already better by soft limits. And vibe limit doesn't affect chat. That alone lets me tend towards Mistral. Unless they start enshitifcation.",
