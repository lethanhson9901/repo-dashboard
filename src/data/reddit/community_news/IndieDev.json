          "text": "I am an instructor on Udemy and I have \\~50k students. At some point I decided to make free courses to attract more people and it was a mistake. My free courses would get a lot of 1 star reviews, mean time paid content would mostly get 5 star reviews.  In the end, I just had to take down all free content because it was effecting my overall instructor rating. I think it's in the psychology or something. My wife tells me, when people pay for things, they are less likely to complain because if they do, they sort of admit that they did not spend money wisely and it would make them fools.  I just think people are taking a lot for granted and do not appreciate other's people work.  \n  \nI swear man, you start giving away gold, some of them folks will complain it's to heavy to carry",

It's becoming a lot more common than it used to be, but you'll see all sorts of items including games routinely priced at 60% off. A $100 new release on a time limited 60% off sale is generally thought to sell better than the same game with zero discount at 40$. However too high a discount can give the opposite effect of making the product seem defective or discounted because it's not worth full price. It's a balancing act, but marketing has had to come a long way since the Henry Ford Era where consumers didn't have a lot of choice.",

The reality is free attracts a very different type of person than paid, especially if you're not under 10$. I'll give you a real life example, my brother owns a traditional small restaurant in our area, a mere ~0.25$ difference (3-10$ meals) from our competitors caused the \"low value crowd\" to burst at the seams with anger 💢 \"how dare you charge so much I'll go next door for 100fils less!\" AND THEY ACTUALLY DID, and since then what happened? No more random self entitled level of complaints, way more polite customers, and largely well praised for quality of food and the irony, the value.\n\nWhat happened was that tiny difference was enough to completely change the economic and social background of the customer base.\n\nChances are, you might be attracting younger learners, even children, when you make it free versus paid, because an adult is a lot more likely to value their time enough to pay for a quality course that helps them learn something a lot faster than if they were to self learn it \"for free\". Whereas a kid wouldn't care so much about the time factor and would care more about you being entertaining to watch, which might be a difficult thing to do if they're comparing you to Youtubers and such. You could also be having a case of completely different countries' citizens being your audience at free.\n\nMy advice is to tailor your offers to the target audience you wish to retain, a free offer might sound more enticing in your head than 25% off or giving some thank-you perk with the course or such, but if it's changing the demographic of who's becoming your student then it's useless if not damaging advertising. Large corporations cater to different audiences by creating different product lines for each, not by muddying the one line trying to make it fit them all.",

I've spoken and worked with a lot of people who do small scale, local work, in particular a piano instructor of mine was willing to talk about how he decides what to charge. The universal truth is you have to meet people's expectations, and they have certain expectations at certain price points. \n\n\nThe developers of the game Peak did a statement talking about how they came up with the price of the game and it actually is a good analysis of what a consumer thinks when seeing price points. Being free does have an ironic expectation nowadays to be able to buy some micro transactions to fix something you don't like about a product. However don't forget bots are plentiful out there, it may seem unlikely but review bombing to tarnish competitors is still a thing, just like review bloating (bots spamming good reviews, don't know the technical term) is a thing.

Get nothing done. \n\nI guess another would be a game you didn't like but want to finish. For me was god of war 3. The game was not fun. Was just brutal visuals. And cool cutscenes. That was mainly it. Had stupid hard puzzles, like why does a brawler game have puzzles??? Combat was spam triangle -_- I changed the difficulty cuz it was so boring. The fantasy was cool, I'm not arguing that, but the gameplay itself was a lot of nothing 😅 I could not wait to finish it. I was also very sad that my young cousin saw me play it and started crying. I tried to keep him away from seeing it he snuck inside. Game were just so much better in PlayStation 2. PS3 just started to be all about graphics but no gameplay",

If the game was free then there is no incentive to stick with it to get past that wall of content. If you already paid for it, you are more likely to push through so as not to waste your money.\n\nImagine getting the entire works of Agatha Christie as a gift. Being given each book one by one year after year would be fine but getting the whole lot in one go? That's a lot of reading ahead. If you had bought it for yourself then you went in knowing what you were signing up for but as a gift? Where do you start? Do you even like her books? Do you like them enough to read the whole set or do you try one and decide it's just too much and give up?\n\nI would never give a negative review over something like this but I understand why people might object to it even if I don't believe they should give a negative review for such a reason as the issue is in their head rather than with the product itself.",

He went from disinterested to looking like he's interested in the smell of his own farts, and I can't really explain why.

On the second one, though, they look more like they are slightly more generic in-game enemies or villains, if that makes sense. Again, the decision only lies in what those characters actually are and what purpose they serve in the game",

So the bottom one almost looks like it's trying too hard. \n\nAlso, mirroring what another poster says, 'showing teeth makes things more scarier' is a trend that's overdone a bit. It can work, don't get me wrong, but here it feels a bit... silly. Especially on rectangle face on the right. Everyone else's grins are small and understated, to an extent, so it makes them feel more sleazy, greasy, if that makes sense. But blockhead there is trying to convince auntie Bettie that no, in face, he does not need to go to the dentist, and is failing that persuasion check.\n\nEnd of the day, both work, but I'd lean more toward the first option.

The reworked option I think is a bit too grotesque for this type of calm dread, but quite great if you want to scale up the feeling and transition from unease into pre-panic for example. Or you can make the faces more distorted in the second one, if you want to go for disgust. \nAlso, this style kinda reminded me of Flash animated indie series on youtube called “Courier” (original title: Курьер) by ReminorBand. [Here’s a link to the first episode](https://youtu.be/x9J2A5I1P4o?si=wGWaO34mGz0cwD3N) in case you trust random strangers on the internet, otherwise feel free to look it up yourself. Highly recommend to at least check out first 5-10 minutes, you may get some inspiration from that (you’ll get from what character when you see it). I also like the idea, plot and atmosphere of this project, so I do recommend it in general. But be warned there’s no English dub, only subs.",

This might be something you could implement very easily, and that would add additional depth and speed for not a lot of effort. You can also lock it until a certain point to not take away from the main game. Also, adding achievements is a great way to add depth, if you haven't already done so!",

You have so many takes, and subgenres of it, idlers that are simple and just look nice, puzzle games where you have to figure out the best synergies, spreadsheet simulators where you spend 20 hours to eke out 0.5% efficiency gain...\n\nSteam probably shows this game to people that already play idlers, and they have much higher and more specific expectations than the person who has never played cookie clicker before.",

          "text": "Hey! I'm quite a critic on idle and incremental games. They're a very special niche; let's see why:\n\n>Reviews call the gameplay slow, shallow, and uninspired. \n\nMost idle/incrementals are like that. Creating a good, non-repetitive idle game is hard. It's not about adding upgrades, do some maths, and call it a day. FWIW, even famous idles like Cookie Clicker are shallow, and would have worse reviews if it wasn't for _Orteil_, its art, storytelling and release date.\n\n>Feedback from the beta testers (after updates) was the opposite... they found it satisfying and enjoyed the unique engagement mechanics and abilities.\n\nThat's good, but don't create a wat between beta testers and normal players. Both are valuable, and none is more right than the other. Understand both, and if your beta-testers are friends or something, _caution_.\n\n>when people spend eight hours playing then leave their first ever game review just to say my game is bland\n\nIt's an idle/incremental. Most idles can't be reviewed after just 1 hour of gameplay. So don't read roo much into that \"8h\". 8h for your game is 1h for a graphical adventure.\n\n>Or feel entitled to it being free. I spent over 1,100 hours on this and it's less than $4\n\nEntitleness is probably not the word. If some review said that, look at it in a constructive way: many simple incrementals are free. It's just how things are. And it doesn't mean yours have to be. But players will compare anyway. $4 looks good for a normal incremental IMO, but it depends on the specifics of course.\n\nAlso: The time it took to make the game means nothing, remember this.\n\n>especially after the positive feedback from reddit and the testers\n\nWell, consider that \"Mixed\" reviews isn't good, but it isn't terrible. People liked it. And there are always more players than reviewers.\n\nNow, to give you some personal ideas around incrementals, I usually categorize incrementals like:\n- Plain incrementals: Simple repetitive loop. They look good for 20 minutes, then it's the same with bigger numbers. Worst ones; I'll usually add a negative review there, _whatever the price_ (You're not _entitled_ to better reviews even if it's cheap or free!). For example, Time Clickers could fall here, even if it could be in the next step. But it does some things very wrong\n- Normal incrementals: There's a more hand-crafted loop, some more content, but it's still the same mechanic. Cookie Clickers or Clicker Heroes are good examples. They're basic equation solvers, but they have some content where you can waste some time\n- Good incrementals: The kind of game I'll never forget. Incrementals that are _not_ numeric loops. They add mechanics out of the incremental meta, and integrate them nicely. Some examples being Melvor Idle (More idle than incremental), Gnorp Apologue or Leafblower Simulator. They are top tier incrementals I 100% recommend playing to understand the psychology behind the genre. Because they're, in different ways, amazing. And you can 100% complete Gnorp in some hours. But I will pay for it double of what I would pay for a 1000h-length generic incremental.",

It probably wouldn't have succeeded to the same extent if it were an unknown releasing today where expectations for incremental games are higher. \n\nThat might be part of my problem. I took a unique mechanic (automatic idle snakes) gave it a unique hook (clicking/dragging on the screen calls food to the snakes), but then gave it a linear upgrade system where you basically just purchase the next available upgrade that you can afford. No math required, no build variety. I'm really proud of the mechanic, but it feels like it's being held back by the lack of depth. \n\nI actually thought about Gnorp Apologue a lot during development. I really felt like my original idea would put it into the same vein as Gnorp and Tower Wizard. I couldn't find a single other automatic Snake-like game on Steam. Feels like wasted potential now...",

                  "text": "As a consumer of idle and incremental games (not a dev), I wouldn't call \"automatic snakes\" your unique mechanic. That's your theme or skin and is probably the least interesting component mechanically--and I don't mean that to shit on your creative effort--but it could be caterpillars, slime molds, trains, spaceships, conga dance lines, or stars collecting planets and the underlying way the player interacts with the screen would be the same.\n\n\nClick/dragging is a mechanic, but is it really different from most idle mechanics, where active play can be used for higher short term earnings/sec. Like, for how the mechanics affect what actions someone is taking, or the choices it presents, how are your snakes different than drone+manual tapping in obelisk miner?\n\n\nFor unique hooks or mechanics, I think of something like Kittens, where taking some research paths blocks other upgrades. Or how terraformential has a rogue-like puzzle component to it that makes each \"prestige\" functionally different and not just \"numbers go up\". Or there was one I forget the name of where you chose skills to boost either idle or active play until the next prestige.\n\n\nFrom just watching the video, I would say the thing that attracted me most was the hypnotizing visuals of the snakes moving around. I would like to see you explore THAT as your unique hook. Can you upgrade different movement patterns? Extra visuals? Pulsing colors or lights?\n\n\nAny way, congratulations on your release! You've got something solid. But just need dig a bit more into what is resonating with people and expand on that.",

Different people like different games, and fans of fast paced action rpgs probably won’t enjoy your slow idle game, no matter how good it is, because that’s just not their niche. \n\nThat’s fine and not something you can change, but if 45% of your players are the wrong crowd, you should look into how that happened. Did you bundle it with the wrong game? Did your trailer suggest it’s more action packed than it is? SOMETHING probably made people who are not the idler crowd buy your game and then it’s no wonder that they didn’t like it.

That means you're close, you're just not 100% there yet.\n\nLooking at the steam page and reviews, most of these sound reasonable so there's probably some good information and feedback to mine here. Like it or not, things like prestige mechanics and unlock progression are expected in incremental/idle games. I don't think you need a hundred layers of different mechanics, but enough that someone could see something new every 10-20 minutes for about 2 hours at least. \n\nI don't know what's present now without playing it myself, but broadly players need new goals that unlock new things. Prestige once, get a flat multiplier. Prestige 3 times, trade in points to unlock challenges. Complete challenges to add a new food type, etc. Egg inc and revolution idle would be great comparison points.\n\nI think the general play area presentation is spot on, no notes. It's cool watching the snakes run around and the mess of numbers.\n\nThe UI on the right needs some work. A bit more conveyance (darken button when you don't have enough money) and more definition to the buttons themselves perhaps. RGB color scheme with buttons shaded on all sides comes across as really default. The link below has some good examples- directional lighting artifacts, heavy bottom shading to sell 3d depth, unique borders, etc.\n\nhttps://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/buttons-set-211824?srsltid=AfmBOopNNgjuwcda5urr2MY5yObp_wcQvOp0TovmJSU0SEE1c7wTTER9\n\nAgain, you're close! People want to like this game or they wouldn't be leaving reviews. Push a bit further, add some additional features, regroup. When you finish the new features, make a community post inviting people to try v1.1 but wait until you're confident you've crossed that 2+ hour mark so you don't burn good will.",

You made a slow meditative incremental idler and some players are complaining that it is slow and predictable, which just means they were not the target audience. Eight hours played and then saying it is not worth it still means the core loop held their attention hence beta testers and Reddit feedback are biased toward the genre and toward you the general store audience is harsher and compares your game to everything they have ever played and spending 1100 hours does not entitle a game to praise because players review experience not effort. Early reviews are usually the harshest because dissatisfied players speak first while okay or mildly satisfied players stay silent. If multiple people call it shallow or generic that is not negative criticism it is usable design information. The only real mistake would be taking it personally or ignoring repeated criticism. Learn from your mistakes so your next game reviews are overwhelmingly positive.",

Sure, it sucks to have something you thought was awesome getting mixed reviews, but it's all feedback and that's not bad.\n\nTangentially, if the public reception is this wildly different from the tester reception, I think you've probably got a bigger disconnect going on here.

Long story short, at the end of the book he finishes the race in last place and, while he is hard on himself about it, his friend points out that there are a lot of trucks that flipped over or otherwise didn't even make it to the end of the race. His hero pulls up next to him and praises him for having gumption and pulling through to the finisb. Everybody else stood out in the spotlight, but his superpower was fighting through to the end no matter what obstacles he faced.\n\nI have started developing several games and have not even come close to ANYTHING shippable or even playable. I saw the obstacles that looked like they were going to prevent me from shipping the end result I was imagining and (partially due to ADD) moved on to the next thing.\n\nYou might not have finished with the result you were hoping for, but MANY people before you haven't even finished the race at all. You are way ahead of most people who aspire to release a game and if you have gotten this far, you have something special.

You can't please everybody, people are prone to deciding what a game should be before they even play it, and if it doesn't fit the rigid idea they've formed, they get upset.\n\nYou can't fix this, but making the trailers and description as accurate as possible may help. \n\n2. Read the reviews with a critical (but not defensive) eye. A lot of negativity in reviews is not exactly in good faith. (i.e. they complain about performance when running a pc with less than half of the minimum specs, or they're upset that a game specifically marketing as a slow paced trading game is a slow paced trading game instead of the first person shooter they wanted.) \n\nThat said, there can be a whole slew of complaints that you are developer-blind to, and it can be very worth making efforts to address these complaints.\n\nImportantly, if you do respond to a review -- be polite, non-defensive, and earnest. Don't respond at all to people with nothing actionable to say.\n\n3. Get as many hands on the project as you can - before asking for their money. My game for example launched in a pretty rough state, despite having a playable demo out for more than a year prior to release. I can't even imagine how much worse it would have been had it just been me testing things out on 1 or 2 machines.\n\nAlso - having a demo may well insulate you from \\*some\\* of the negativity, as people who are immediately disinterested are less likely to buy refund and review.\n\nIf you've got eyes on the project, run betas/etc prior to release if you can.\n\nLastly - looking at your game things aren't dire. Many of the negative reviews list positive features, and the general feeling is that the game doesn't scale much for an idler game and has minimal content, with some even acknowledging that the game could get better over time.\n\nImo responding gracefully, (and publicly), with your intentions to address criticism/add content/etc -- may well turn things around.",

Life growing up may have been incredibly cruel, they may have felt like an outsider or undeserving of even being in the same class as fellow students who they thought made much better art. And honestly, the “first official work“ that was released to rave reviews most certainly wasn’t actually their first release work. They may have gotten negative feedback on their art in art school by their fellow students or teachers or advisors. Maybe everyone liked it except the one person who is opinion really mattered to them like their spouse or parent.\n\nThere are a lot of moving parts in the world of art, and sadly I feel like those moving parts tip the scales negatively in our favor almost all of the time. It’s always a struggle, it’s always an uphill battle. another thing I have taken to heart for so long as a filmmaker was when someone framed the way to be a successful filmmaker to be literally obsessed with it. You have to be obsessed to make films because the road is so rough. All the rejection, all of the problems, the costs, the time… Any other person would give up immediately.

You don't know what people's expectations were when the bought the game - based on images, video, price, or whatever text the read (assume no one but you has actually read your whole text): 18 reviews might be too early, and you need more of your target audience to try the game.\n2. You don't know what type of player bought the game - if you wanted idler players to buy it, but someone picked it up because they assumed it was closer to a factory game (as an example), the feedback might be valuable, but you have to adjust the lens you see it through.\n3. Maybe you made the wrong game for the right audience - the things you like about the idea are actually closer to what the feedback is looking for, in which case the feedback could be ultra helpful if you're willing to lean into the things they're looking for.\n\n  \nTo be a bit reductive, imagine you're a restaurant. You're going to serve this dish every day, to new people, for a year. Every time someone walks in the door and gives you feedback, you either:\n\nhave an artistic goal, and you need to learn which feedback to reject: you don't want to be laid astray by people that were looking for something else, but happened to walk in your door,\n\nor you have a technical goal, and you want to make the best version of a dish that people like: it's your job to filter out the reviews to figure out who is providing feedback that is going to help you refine your direction.",

It is still a game, and therefore does need progression to some degree, even if it's slow. \n\nIf I could recommend, I would suggest making a lot of the unlocks locked behind progression, add some more content with progression, and slowly expand the map, and maybe even play on the idea of planets and galaxies since you're in space. Just some ideas. It has a lot of potential as a game for sure, so definitely just take the reviews as criticism. Remember, they paid money and gave your game time. Negative review or not, they tried it out, and therefore your game has potential at face value.\n\nGood luck!",

There's a lot of stuff out there (great and garbage) that people never discover. You did enough things right to intrigue people to buy and play it. Also, it's still early. You just released it and reviews are just like any other type of data -- unstable at small sample sizes. If it's still mixed when you have 10x the number of reviews you have now, then that is more telling than your current reviews. \n\nAlso, some games aren't always as great as they could become at the initial release... some devs just want to get something out, get a feel for what players like/dislike, and then transform it into a better version of what they originally intended. \n\nI know nothing about your game or you (other than what is in your post), but I think it's rad you had an idea, built the game, and released it. That's more than most ever do, and your game might be totally awesome. It's just too early to tell and there's a lot to celebrate already.

Good start.\n\n-It looks very lovely - my partner walked into the room while it was on my screen and went \"oooh, what's that? Link it to me\"\n\n-It promises to be fairly short (which is good for me, my favourite game of the last few months was Execute, which was a £5 four-hour game with a great idea that got in and out quickly and didn't waste my time. Love it). You aren't hiding the 100% achievement completion behind thousands of hours of pointless repetition like some idle games.\n\nBad:\n\n-Your priorities seem to be in very strange places, which come across as very inexperienced - for example, why do you have a playable piano when your upgrades aren't greyed out when the player can't afford them? \n\n-You have a prestige mechanic hidden in a strange place which seems to be quite half-baked?\n\nAs I said, I've played 4 hours, at this point I'm fairly content to just leave it as a wallpaper on my third screen occasionally clicking back in order to work on the task list, there doesn't feel like an incentive to do any more, and the very little interaction the game does have requires me to look closer at the game to figure out what I can/can't afford. \n\nI had fun with it, and I don't regret the purchase. I will try to remember to leave a positive review to help out once I 100% it. It's a perfectly fine first attempt, so many people do so much worse and never get better. Stick with it.",

Way too many variables to even start to worry about.\nOne example being half-life. But those are so ultra rare that it even overshadowed bunch of legendary games of its time.\nAnd the devs were seasoned already to begin with, just in different program type :p\n\nNever chase the high, we humans often focus too much on that. It's normal and okay, but not the way when it's too big of a focus. Too much of anything can be bad anyway.\n\nYou are doing well, don't worry about it! And you are allowed to feel bummed about it too, but also definitely should feel bunch of positive feelings from the good things you learned and did through it(as many pointed out)!\n\n55% is awesome especially with that amount of reviews! Also, hopefully one of your future projects will be even more enjoyed by whoever wants to enjoy them! I sometimes find some games that have like 98% rate and i couldn't care less, cuz they aren't for me and so i don't even try them because id not like it.

It's okay that the pacing is slow but it doesn't really feel like any signifigant depth opens up as you play. Even as a relaxed idler it feels shallow. For games I'm usually aiming for $1-2/hrs of enjoyment. For an idler I'd expect more hours because my play itself is more dilute and hands off. I think this game falls short of that. The game has neat visuals but I feel with the current complexity it would be hard to justify buying this versus any other free more involved idle game. As a player keep in mind I don't get to see the 1000 hours of effort that went in, all I see is the final product.\n\n\nEven though it is a zen and relaxing game, that doesn't mean it needs to lack complexity or meta progression. I think that is the biggest disconnect between you and your more critical reviews.\n\n\nThis review might sound a little harsh but I'm just trying to be honest to help with your next game.

I tend to play 1 idle game at a time and 100% it before moving on to another game. Moving on to another game is always one of the most difficult decisions for me because I know I am usually making a 1-3 year commitment to have a game running on my computer 99% of the time. For me, idle games should be low in graphics and be pleasant to have up on my screen for the entire duration. I specifically target incremental games like yours, but if I were looking for a new game right now, I wouldn’t choose it because it appears to be too graphicly intensive. If you want some examples of successful incremental games, look at NGU Idle, Trimps, and Melvor Idle as examples of a game someone will want to keep up all of the time. \n\nI hope you have great success in your game dev endeavors however and I hope your game becomes the next big thing. Idle gamer are slow to adopt new games, so just give it time",

But if you can hit the cap of the game within a day, or there isnt much tangible reason to continue, then i wouldnt choose it over the hundred others- hell cookie clicker even.\n\nI think what you need to do is take some time, let the stress of the negative pass away, and go at it again. People want more prestige levels, they want more snakes, they want their upgrades to feel like they matter. They dont want a faster beefier game, but they want to be able to play it instead of having it as a screensaver.\n\n\nAlso, I haven't played your game. But the current steam page without reading your descriptions feels very arcade, fast paced. Your video is quick, your images show explosions, and your colors are bright and snappy. Id expect something calm and meditative to have pretty scenic backgrounds and light pastel colors.",

What I read from those comments (as an objective eye) is that they were excited about the game from what they saw in the trailer (like me) but when it came to playing, they felt very passive. So what I infer from that, is that you took \"idler\" a bit to literal and didn't give them too much agency on the game. And if you remember the flow chart, if you don't have even a little challenge (or at least the illusion of a challenge, as one commentor said) you fall into boredom. I kinda agree with you, that people should relax a bit with a 4 Dollar game. But at the same time, to them it feels like they paid 4 dollars for a glorified screen saver. In the end, an idler game, should still be a game. (I haven't played it, so I don't know if that is a valid point, but that's what I read from the comments)\n\nAlso, congratulations for getting so many reviews in so little time. I released 2 weeks ago and have 3 reviews. Doesn't feel that great too \\^\\^°",

Art is subjective, and unfortunately, this time around, a lot of people didn't like your game for whatever reasons.\n\nYou can continue to support the game, taking on their feedback and improving it, or you can call it here and work on a new project. Either way, you'll have new experiences to take with you so you can hone your craft :)",

Usually for good software you want to take those reviews to improve the product rather than being emotionally driven by this.. but if a kid makes a game you can expect them to cry on a couple of bad reviews and then quit game dev after this or start another game thinking this will never happen again. It will 'cos you'll do the same things again if you do not address their concerns. So three options.. Improve gameplay or do another game with improved gameplay or take this personally.",

          "text": "Ah, I'm sorry that's happening. My suggestion is to try to make the best of it though. Make sure you read the reviews and see what people are criticising. If there's room for improvement in your game and the reviews are giving constructive criticism, maybe work toward implementing fixes/improvements into an update.\n\nThere are major big budget games that have released with terrible average review scores, and they've spent time updating their games and fixing things, and eventually completely turned things around and now get raving reviews about how great the games are. No Man's Sky is a perfect example of that.\n\nDon't get discouraged. I think it's awesome that you were able to release your game after working on it for so long. It's great that you actually have a game finished and released and out there for people to buy. It's something to be proud of, and if there is room for improvement in your game and you can take the constructive criticism and turn it into something even better, it could be a great opportunity. Now that the game is finished and playable, working on some updates and new content for it would be a great way to bring more attention to your game and change people's opinions on it.\n\nDon't underestimate how valuable your updates will be once the people who bought your game see you working on it. Gamers have a ton of respect for developers that actually take their comments and criticisms to heart and turn them into updates in the games. Having a customer see their suggestion put into a game is awesome and makes your players feel like they're being heard and listened to, and can really turn things around.\n\nUpdate: I was curious, so I went out and read some of the negative reviews. Honestly, there is some actual constructive criticism in these, so you might be able to turn some of these into a positive. If you do decide to make some changes and push an update, make sure you go to the negative review that inspired it, and post a comment in response to the player, so they know that you made an update based on their feedback.",

I didn't hate my time with this game, but it also did not really feel like much of an experience either. It's pretty, it's streamlined, it runs well, but you don't ever do anything new and, strictly speaking, you don't do anything at all except occasionally upgrade a thing. That loosely describes most idle / incremental games, but there is usually some illusion of choice or direction, some incentive to look and pay attention. That does not exist here. Maybe worth a couple dollars for something you have in the background for a day.\n\nSo, first off, that's not actually negative as they say it's generally more neutral. 55% being mixed reviews reflects a similar level of neutral to me so that's something.\n\nYou may have set out to simply make this without much to do, or you just weren't sure what all could go into it to make it feel more interesting without betraying that calm slow meditative take. That said, I do think it's important to give people something to do even in games that may on their surface be against that premise. Definitely spend time in the space you want your game to live within and see what does well and what doesn't. Also, when conducting testing research you need to come at it knowing people can be more positive when they know they're talking to the developer and are being asked to test things vs having spent money on something and being able to recommend that to other players and not be giving feedback to developers. Also, you need to remember to ask questions that can help guide what you should be doing. If someone says the game is relaxing and cute, for example, you need to probe around what it may be lacking, whether or not they would feel compelled to play this for longer than 10-15 minutes, what it feels like compared to other games in the genre/approach. Market research is tough, and there's a reason people spend a LOT of money and time conducting it properly. That's not accessible for a lot of indie devs, so remember to try and push people when you have them and get what you can out of it.\n\nNow the question is, do you iterate on this game and try to add things or tweak things based on what the responses are saying, or do you take it to heart and move on to your next game. Either way, congratulations on getting a game out there that people have played enough to leave reviews for! So many just fall into obscurity.",

I'm not sure what that means in context but it sounds like it breaks the main gameplay loop.\n\nSome other comments are saying that this is a marketing issue, that the wrong people are finding your game. But if incremental idle fans are finding your game and think it's too shallow, then I have to wonder is there *any* market for a game where you *do* so little?

          "text": "Hi u/OldAtlasGames, just had a quick look at the reviews and at least they seem to give great feedback. Combined with all the great replies you have that seems to be a great start for a potential next step that could be adjusting the game to the reviewers expectations if you like. \n\nIf you'd like to try and do something like this I may - albeit I say this as a gamer, not a professional - change the games description to add a big fat update notice on top that says that you've listened and changed these and those points to improve the game and make it more exciting or sth. along those lines.\n\nAt the same time I'd place a discount that lowers the price to sth. like just 1$. So low, people may simply buy it because why not. This has multiple advantages: You show up in the list of heavily discounted games, reching a wider steam audience. You get more sales and reviews, every single gamer may recommend your game. The expectations for a game that is just 1$ are way lower than those for a 4$ game. Ideally reviews may say that they'd even buy it for those 4$. Once you have reached that level, you may end the discount and see how income and reviews develop from there.\n\n\\------------\n\nWhat you could also ask yourself for future ventures is why the beta testers and the steam clients view the game that differently. Biggest question you could ask yourself here is: Who were the beta testers? Were they friends? Always a bad idea. They most likely tend to rate your work more favourably than internet randos. I would too, simply because I'm already excited that my friend has made something cool. I want it to be cool, because you are my friend. Hence I'll potentially look over lots of potential issues that others see more clearly.\n\nOr were they perhaps random fans your game gathered during the development phase? That may come with similar issues.\n\n\\-------------\n\nThis too reminds me of an episode of the TV series \"Silicon Valley\" that is loosely inspired by real-life events. There the protagonists do a closed beta for their app and get overwhelmingly positive feedback. Then their VC associate tests it and is not exactly excited. They launch and fail miserably: Nobody gets the app. Turns out their mistake was that they exclusively invited friends from software engineering and didn't realize that a trained engineering brain has an easier time navigating their to others rather convoluted UX than random B2C users. Oops.\n\nAlways try to get beta testers who are closest to actual potential buyers. Easier said than done of course. The game looks definitely pretty cool and I'm tempted to give it a try, even if it's just for the sake of supporting your ventures a tiny little bit :) Have fun, don't let this first experience draw you down, see it as helpful feedback to improve or well, change to cater towards your gamers & furthermost: Keep it up, enjoy your great venture!",

Maybe a pacing/balance pass would help alot. With idlers/incremental, oftentimes make things less convenient than you think they should be at first so \"baseline\" game loop feels like an upgrade. \n\nI dont think your game is cooked at all, try and update, tell people you have listened to their feedback, and see where it goes. If it is cheap to gate or add content, do a bit of that and market it as 1.1. \n\nDude, 20 reviews already puts you well into the top half of steam AND you shipped a cool looking little game. Be proud of yourself, take the feedback, and apply it to your next title after you're done updating this one. You've already proven you are a gamedev, just have to improve the craft. \n\nGood job and I'll be purchasing and leaving a good review.",

But I played over 100 hours of it and truly enjoyed my time with it. I'll bet some people who left negative reviews on that game played even more than I did. \n\nEnjoyment of a game is pretty subjective and you never know what will or won't click with a specific player. Some games just aren't for some players and sometimes one or two specific issues (Monster Hunter Wilds' poor graphical optimization, for example) can result in a deluge of negative feedback. It's not that that feedback isn't valid, but it has a wildly outsized impact on the overall score and perception of the game. I never even left a Steam review for MHW because I felt generally pretty happy with it and don't leave reviews for anything unless there's something very specific to say (good or bad).\n\nAnd ultimately: you have a game on Steam. That's a massive achievement on its own (congratulations!) and means you are sitting there alongside games like Monster Hunter, and are getting feedback on your game in the same way they are, and I TOTALLY get how difficult and demoralizing some of that would feel, but that's also an amazing opportunity to have moving forward with whatever you choose to do next, whether that's continuing to work on this game or build something brand new, etc.",

I've also noticed a lot of people giving bad reviews on idle games for literally playing as described so it's not always about the \"game being bad/bland\" but it's a lot of people trying to force themselves to like the entire idle games genre when they may only like a select few. Idle games can vary so much from game to game it's on the player to find the ones they like. As a non-gamedev is always bugged me seeing reviews like that because they're literally playing the game as advertised and yet they're upset that it wasn't more? Anyways though once I have funds I would love to play your game, it looks really interesting and I love the name of it!\n\nMaybe based off some of the reviews though you could do some QOL updates if you are worried about too many people not liking the slowness. If you're still in contact with your beta testers they may have some ideas on how to help as well. 🙂‍↕️",

Show up a few more times and then make sure to pop into a few more streams afterwards. If you can, make it a habit of popping in occasionally when they stream. Don’t just be a “one and done” person cause even if they let you drop your game, they won’t shout you out when you’re not there unless they like you. You wanna aim for steamers around a few thousand followers or more. Small enough to talk to but big enough where they’re clearly taking it seriously. Make it a daily habit to find a new steamer or interact with someone you’ve already met. Make sure their friend streamers get to know you as well. Make sure you keep looking for streamers outside of their friend group as well otherwise you’ll get promoted to the same audience over and over and over cause a lot of streamers have the same fan base as their friends.",

With all due respect, that will singlehandedly be the reason this game never sees the light of day.\n\nMaybe a really good game, but unfortunately most people will never know.\n\nMost games in this space don't even ask for anything over $15 at full price. And even that's pushing it. At $10 this game would sell like hotcakes. It would be an impulse buy for a lot of people.\n\nYou also need to consider how that converts to different countries, as a lot of your audience might not even reside in the US. If it's too high for us here, it's probably unobtainable elsewhere.\n\nDifferent type of game, but even Stardew was only asking 15, and theres a lot to offer there.\n\nBest of luck!",

What I remember is that it was an isometric, turn-based, bug battling game that took place on top of a picnic table outside. the graphics were reminiscent of Bug Battle, but that was not the game. I remember it was a very simple interface, and you mostly just watch the bugs fight without any input, but very difficult to get past the first two fights. I am honestly not sure that the game was real or if I just dreamed it up, because I haven't been able to find it for years.",

Most of it is tools, automation, localization, testing, and platform-specific systems, and a large part doesn’t even ship in the final game but supports our development pipeline.

It may not look like much, but every technical subsystem that needs to be specialized is written for the target platform: achievements, session management, persistence, keyboard input, etc.\n\nThe other big reason is that this is our fourth game and we’re starting from an infrastructure framework that we’ve built over time. One of the biggest parts is the system that lets us write data to Google spreadsheets and automatically get all the data organized into ScriptableObjects in Unity. It’s a pretty complex system that we’ve been carrying around since our second game.\n\nAnother very large part is the automated testing system, our custom internal localization system, and lots of small tools that help us during development.\n\nSo in short, most of the project doesn’t even get compiled into the final game, it’s there to support the development pipeline or to handle other platforms.",

Thank you so much.  \nI just put the samples on a very very low number (I use maya + Arnold) and then I use a toon shader and lights to exagerate highlights and make sure the shape of the character is readable with low sampling. \n\nI then place a rotating camera around the character and render each frame.\n\nI use a free software called \"glue it\" that creates the spritesheets out of the renders. That's pretty much it for these rotating gifs. \n\nFor the game is way more complex because the you can swap the arms, head, chest and legs of the character, so for that we render every limb separately in all poses and that generates a ton of sprites. I export them as PSB files and add bones in unity. It's a bit of a nightmare but after a bunch of characters is just a repetitive process!",

Experience is your best weapon against poor design which paradoxically means you need to make a few mistakes first.",

EVERYTHING... you can't ask most teenagers to write so much as a paragraph, without six sample sentences, a template they can use, speech to text accomodations in case they cant type, a few exemplars they can just imitate directly, and a picture of a sentence on the wall, so they can remember what one looks like if they forget. You have to hold their hand from the moment they walk in the door, to the moment you and their mom strap them in to their highschooler-sized carseats and send them home again.  \n  \nIf you hand a kid homework, they sick their parents on you, and now you're a 'bad' teacher, because their 15 year old (who still refuses to even ATTEMPT work involving fractions or decimals, but is still somehow in AP classes) feels anxious and overwhelmed by the ten to twenty problems you sent home with them. If they cant solve it, its your fault as the teacher for not supplying them with a single, magic cheatsheet they can follow to complete every problem they could possibly run into, their entire lives. If you expect a kid to TRY or EXERT EFFORT in order to succeed, you are already on your way to being fired, because thats not fair to these poor, poor kids.\n\nHonestly, I dont personally think AI is gonna take over or anything like that... but these kids better hope it does. If they have to grow up and be responsible for their own lives, they'll starve. I spend every day trying my damnedest to get them to understand that they are, sooner or later, going to have to feed, clothe, and care for THEMSELVES, and they just do not believe that it is true... its always someone elses job to solve their problems for them.  \n  \n And no, you dont sound bitter, you sound level headed and mildly annoyed... \\*I\\* sound bitter, lol.",

The streaming aspect would have been more obvious if you added the live, battery logo etc up there. \nThe new one doesn't really convey him streaming but seems more like a holiday recording of such if that makes sense? Feels a bit more spotless than the old one due to it being more busy. \n\nI believe a combination of both approaches would be cool. Show Sisyphus holding the bolder with his sholer and arm, smiling towards the camera on his side or behind him with a thumps up. Make the live streaming aspects camera view aspects VERY obvious like in the new one. Maybe add hands like someone is holding the camera and their fingers or entire hand is kinda overlapping the camera. Makes the player feel more engaged by looking at it and conveys the aspect of streaming yourself more obvious. Make the background less busy like in the old version. With that you should very accurately convey the style of game that you are going for. Hope that helps!",

Read through the whole post to figure out that he is Dionysus, a few more minutes on Google to figure out where is the connection, now that's for me, who love to dig through things like these.. but what about some random guy scrolling through steam? Huge bearded half-naked man smiling at the camera featuring a huge stone and a somewhat indistinguishable.... humanoid creature, plus semi-unreadable text. You know where this is going.",

Just from a marketing point of view I wouldn’t trust the audience to know boulder and Sisyphus are connected (much less trust that they will understand this is a references to Albert Camus’s 1942 essay). So use that pushing the boulder up a hill imagery to your advantage because that is much more recognisable, plus more people know the story just as “the guy who pushes the boulder up the hill constantly”",

The little beak is probably the most recognizable part of this design so you don't want to cover it up.

I don't know what kind of game you're making so this might not even be relevant, but if you've got like an invincibility powerup then the full face mask look could be a fun extra detail for that. Just a thought.\n\n  \nBut if I was going to pick just one as the best, I'd probably go with A1.",

Also I would say anything from A1 to A3 are good choices. The final decision should depend on the way your character is setup. If you want a less experienced rookie knight then go with A1. A3 looks more hardcore with the sharper cheek plate so it would represent a more experienced and badass version of the character. A2 on the other hand is a fine balance between the two. Every other version you lose too much detail and the character becomes more generic. But like I said where the character is currently in their story should be the deciding factor. \nHope this helps",
