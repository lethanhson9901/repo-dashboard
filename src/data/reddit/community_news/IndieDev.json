          "text": "The feedback is real… even if it’s harsh sometimes. I learned that the hard way. At the beginning, I was thinking (like you) that the problem was Reddit and redditors. After developing two games and facing the same issues you’re facing, I started to think that maybe the problem was my games... and that redditors were right.\n\nThe problem is that there are too many games being developed, and a lot of them are very similar. You can’t blame people for being tired of that. I shifted to software development, trying to build something that hasn’t already been developed thousands of times… and things started going much better. One of my pieces of software (still game-related) is selling and has received a lot of positive feedback.\n\nYou have to be creative... and I don’t mean creative within a platformer game. I mean creative in what you decide to build in the first place. Think about it: how many platformers are developed every day? Why should people invest time just to give feedback? If you develop the same thing most people are developing, you will never stand out, and nobody will even care.\n\nI wanted to develop games too, but maybe I’m just not good enough at it. I discovered that I have more creativity and can build a lot more if I’m not strictly focused on games.\n\nBuild games that will never stand out? No. Build a SaaS that thousands of people are already building every day? Again, no. But there’s so much opportunity if you do some research in a niche with a strong community. Even mods, if you want to stay game-related. If it’s a mod that the community has been asking for for years, you can get support on Patreon quite easily.\n\nThis is just my experience, so take it as it is.",

The bottom one evokes feelings of claustrophobia and paranoia, whereas the top evokes feelings of isolation. The top font feels somewhat whimsical and makes me think of ski slopes, whereas the bottom feels like it's for horror.\n\nI would say that the top one looks like an arcade game where you're trying to get as much gold as you can and shovel your way through the snow while avoiding the dark figures. The bottom looks like a short story focused game that has fairly simple gameplay.\n\nThey both look very good so if I saw either in a storefront my choice in which to click would be based on which style of game I prefer. I personally would be more likely to check out the bottom game. Taking a look at the game on Steam, I feel like the top image better evokes the idea of the game (or at least the idea that I got from the trailer on Steam)",

Yours looks like you used an open source font. Not bad and the snow effect over it helps. But with the “painted” look and repeating characters it has a thematic clash.\n\nThe artists one I like the regular type face style for Froggy and Snow. And going with a different look for Hates. Unfortunately it looks too similar to the title art for Hades (and some of that is just the similar spelling)\n\nMaybe swap their Hates for yours. Or recommend a change from a “wind blown” look to an “icicle”. Froggy hates the snow and ice not the wind. Then maybe you could move the shovel icon to the word Hates next to Froggy, giving it a more “in snow” look. And making the shovel an aspect of Froggy",

          "text": "I think the first one is better. The second one seems more bland to me tbh. I think it's the open perspective and the crisp imagiry of the second that kind of doesn't work for me. When I look at it I'm not really sure, what to expect. The frog sits there in the foreground basically in an open scenery. There are menacing statues behind them but the frog seems expressionless. In an open plane it seems weird that the frog is where it is. It also seems weird that it should give me the feeling of a snowstorm but also all the graphics seem extremely crisp aside from the little detail snowflakes in front of the objects. That's why the image only evokes the idea of a shovel ware action movie poster/dvd cover for me. The first image actually conveys a feeling of being snowed in to me. The perspective is more limited which in turn makes me understand why the frog just sits there. There is no other place to go even when the menacing statues are right behind. The second one might be better from a technical perspective but personally I think the artistic vision of it is confusing at best while the first image clearly conveys a feeling and an idea that lets my mind construct around it.\n\nIf I look at the first image I expect a really well made indi game with style and vision. When I look at the second image I expect a somewhat lacking game from a corporate setting. (Aside from companies never daring to create something that looks this experimental.)\n\nOf course that is just my opinion. Explaining why art does what it does is difficult and maybe someone else sees it completely differently. But I hope my perspective helps.",

I would either reword that or just get rid of the word quesiton and replace it with something more impactful. A narrator with that voice wouldn't use the word \"question\" there. It's not a question. We're talking life or death, world ending vs world saving. I would consider something in the realm of Moment of truth, final test, trial, not that exactly plugged into that sentance but you get the idea. Maybe consider rewording that part in general.\n\n\"Or will you beleive the lie of choice\". I love where this monologue is going but I'm not loving the \"lie of choice\" part there. I would reword this as well. The word \"Temptation\" comes to mind. I think of that scene in Indiana Jones where they have to choose the cup. Everyone gets infatuated with the fancy cups. They lose sight of the mission and end up having their soul sucked dry haha. Your character is facing a trial on his question. And they must maintain composure and strength and not succumb to temptation or greed. Idk. I feel like there's better wording in that for that monologue.\n\nEdit: Maybe \"lie of choice\" makes more sense in the context of you're game? I have no idea, obviously. You know better than I.",

Idk if you are a fan of FF7 but you can checkout [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GsXtxxKqEg) and see how they remade the original soundtracks but still kept the charm of the original melodies by putting focus on the original melodies accompanied by orchestra quality.\n\nI think orchestras should actually be more involved in game soundtracks these days, just don't forget that it's about the melody and not about the orchestra.",

          "text": "Many people have asked the same questions so for easier reference here are the answers:  \n1. It was recorded in North Macedonia in FAMES  \n2. The price was around 2000e for 56 people for one hour session + recording engineer and studio and conductor  \n3. I paid an additional mix/master fee of 150e to a friend (discounted price)   \n4. I managed to record two tracks, around 3 min total\n\nBelow are some things I have learned from this experience: \n\n* I prepared the scores. I have been composing for a long time, but last 6 years I have been learning classical harmony and voice leading and other “academic” music disciplines.\n* That said I did not read through several books (usually 800-1000 pages) of orchestration, but I did reference some (especially for harp). I watched a Udemy tutorial → about 20 hours on orchestration that really has a good digest of everything that is most important and many youtube videos where people explain their particular instrument and techniques in great detail.\n* Even though I really enjoyed the Udemy course I triple checked with several people that I know have recorded real orchestras and there were some discrepancies in opinions and I used my best judgment.\n* For instance wether you should write a key signature. Many people say that its easier for the musicians in these intense sight reading and recording situations to not use a key signature. Ultimately my music is tonal and I decided to keep them in.\n* Second was about horns, its important to write for horns 1 and 3 to be the upper voice or voices and horns 2 and 4 to be the bottom voice or voices. This is very counter intuitive and requires getting used to.\n* Take care of your groupings. This composition is in 10/16 and I group in 3+3+2+2. The score is super readable that way. With default Dorico setting it would be HORROR to read.\n* Timpani - I was afraid what I wrote would not make sense as the pitches I needed were slightly out of the range of some drums, but this is the big takeaway: these people are professionals. This guy has been playing timpani his whole life, he knew in an instant how to solve the problem. Even though I had 4 pitches, he played it on two drums. So what I am trying to say is unless you write something that is really unplayable these people will make it happen.\n* The only way to really learn is to do it. I think this one orchestral session has taught me more than 10 books and years of lessons (but ideally you will do both). Music has best practices, but even among the hard rules people disagree so just try to find the thing that works for you and people you work with.\n* You have to know to play and at least understand an instrument(s) or know people who can tell you whats what, so that you can decide how much time you actually need for the recording session (one hour is minimum). I had two compositions. Each slightly over a minute, both in odd time signatures. One was uptemo, the other downtempo. We barely made it in one hour, and probably the result would have been much better if we had a bit more time. The downtempo was considerably easier and took less takes to get right.\n* Don’t write at the extreme edge of the instruments range.\n* I was thinking about where the winds and brass would breath, but the musicians told me not to worry, that they will figure it out on their own.\n* Check you parts since notation programs can do crazy stuff when exporting.\n* Condensed VS full score for conductor: honest answer, I don’t know and they probably don’t care.\n* Full orchestra VS recording sections. For the sound its much better to record sections. Its probably going to be more expensive, but not much more since some sections don’t play all the time so you need less time with them. BUT, hearing the full orchestra together in the room and having a video, I don’t know, for me its a dream come true. There is a lot of debate around this, I am sorry I cannot provide better answers at this point. Brass and percussion really dominate all microphones and it can be quite difficult to mix.\n* People will record in segments and glue together, I took integral recordings, I am an old school guy.\n* So in the end I’d say, try and learn everything you can, but don’t worry, these people are really pro and will play anything. I guess if you can find a colleague with more experience, that means a lot, and if anybody needs any help feel free to DM me. If there are any unanswered questions, just let me know.",

I have actually paid for it with my own money, and I have been around the industry (21 years active). Its just that I was waiting for the right opportunity and when we were setting up Retromagine one of the goals was that we wanted to try and do things we really really love (and I understand that this might be what many people will say, but then they will optimize for profit instead of love). It might not work out, but it was a calculated risk. Judging by some responses here, there are people who actually appreciate this.  Will they buy the game? I don't know, but ultimately I don't think that recording this orchestra will be either our downfall or our major success, but in my life, it is a highlight.  And honestly Id be super happy if some of our games can continue to have orchestral scores and that this can become a sort of a brand thing (the other big love is chip tunes). ",

          "text": "> Do you think that players even care?\n\nI think most players appreciate good music and most players value \"real\" music over AI generated. However, I think the average person could not tell the difference between music made with virtual instruments like [EastWest Symphonic Orchestra](https://www.soundsonline.com/orchestras/symphonic-orchestra) from music played by an actual orchestra, especially in the context of a video game where the music is just one of the many things they are taking in at a given moment. So, if they don't even realize the difference it's hard for that to translate to caring unless you actively educate them on it. And whether it's worth spending your limited marketing resources educating them that they should care that your music is a recording of a live performance will vary a lot by game/genre/audience.\n\n> Is music important enough to justify that level of work and budget?\n\nIt really depends on the game. Whether it's graphics, sound, audio, etc., one mistake I think a lot of people make is thinking that evaluating how good a piece of art is is the main thing you have to ask in order to decide if it enhances the game. Most commonly, this is the idea that photorealistic graphics are inherently a better fit. But this isn't true. Again, to use graphics as an example, not only might another art style (e.g. cartoon, pixel art, surrealist, abstract) fit better to a particular game, but the \"quality\" of graphics in the context of a game isn't just \"does it look great\" but things like \"does the player know where to look\", \"can the player find X\", \"does the player know what X is/means\", etc. So, it turns out that rather than evaluating art and then, because it's good, you decide it's an enhancement to add it to the game, I think for the best art, you need to start with the purpose of the game and use that to ask what the art needs to do in order to serve that purpose. And I think it's the same with everything, including music. You can't just say \"is this better music\" and then decide it's worth adding to the game because it's better music. You need to understand what the vision for the game is and then ask what the music needs to be like in order to help that vision come alive. In that sense, \"is music important enough to justify that level of work and budget\" isn't really a question that can be answered generically. I think the answer is sometimes yes and often no.\n\nIf a game is story driven and you want emotional engagement with the story, maybe the music serves to reinforce the particular emotion a player is supposed to be feeling at a moment. Meanwhile, in a game like Tetris Attack where you're rushing to make defensive and offensive combinations, the music intensifies when you're nearing death so that, even if you cannot see that you're near death, you can hear it and know to go on the defense. In another game, music might facilitate concentration. In another, music might help the player sync up with the rhythm of gameplay actions. Etc. So, I don't think there is some generic answer that investing money in live orchestra recordings of music is worth it. Different style and complexity of music makes sense for different games.\n\n> But to me, this is what being indie means. Doing what we love, not just what’s optimal for the P&L (within reason, of course).\n\nI think indies do benefit from being willing to make the \"less optimal for their P&L\" choices and thus find niches and untapped markets. I do wonder whether what you're doing actually achieves that. While not a lot of games are hiring a live orchestra, AAA studios are definitely producing human-made music to the quality level of your soundtrack. So, the actual differentiator here (you hiring an orchestra vs a AAA studio hiring a professional composer who records bits and samples others to make something that sounds just as good) might go unnoticed by many. But if it helps you stay motivated and helps you tell your story, then good for you.\n\n> And if anyone is considering recording with a live orchestra for their game, I’m happy to share logistics and real numbers. If there’s interest, I can also write up a detailed breakdown of the whole process.\n\nThat would be interesting, but I would imagine that unless the message is \"it's not as expensive as you think\", a lot of people would just be reading out of curiosity and not be positioned to actually do it.",

It sounds like you wrote this fully orchestra piece yourself?\n\nI record and compose too and have played in an orchestra. While I have written orchestra pieces before (using the East West Symphonic Orchestra virtual instrument I mentioned in my last comment), I'd think when you're writing for real humans rather than a digital instrument you need to pay a lot more attention to what is sane to play rather than just what sound result you want and that seems hard to know or keep track of with so many different instruments that each have their own quirks. \n\nWas there an iterative process with the musicians or composer where you made adjustments to fit the music and the humans playing it? Was there any iterative process where you refined the music as you heard them play it? How much time did they get between receiving your music and actually needing to perform it? Did you just luck out into writing music that was very playable and they just walked in and basically sight read it?",

Back then I thought: wow, that must be a whopper to pay. I mean, it ain't \"two carts of Marlboro\" cheap, that's for sure but it is affordable.\n\n  \nOf course, Vienna will cost more. But Budapest, Sofia, Skopje, cities where you might find great talent and get amazing results and not get ripped off. Though, disclaimer: I am not a sound expert. I can only make games, there are professionals out there with keen ear that can differentiate between \"really good symphony orchestra\" and \"really good assembly of samples\".\n\nAnd I guess it also depends on the game theme as well. For example, I am making a WWII inspired game: of course, my wishes are epic, heroic, historical, drama, symphony orchestra (right away). But wishes are one thing, reality always hits heavily. Though, 2k EUR for a masterpiece music like this (minus composing which you did yourself, great job there!) is not that much.\n\n  \nTrouble with me is that I get easily excited (that's what she said) so I would love to have an entire soundtrack, dozens of themes :D",

I can tell you that after I had the initial composition down as a draft, the \"polish\" and getting the score to look great took quite a bit of time.   \n  \nI think that now that I know how it works it will be much easier/faster. If I needed to write this now I'd say maybe a few days, maybe a week to get it from start to finish in terms of preparing the score, and then one day to record it, and one day for mix/master.  \n\nOf course when I say I know how this works, I mean I know the basics. The real mastery of composition and orchestration is a lifelong learning process. ",

You have a skill that few indie devs (if any) have.  You might literally be the only indie dev I've ever encountered with the skill of composing.   This is the single greatest limitation for any other indie dev wanting to follow in your tracks.  They'd have to hire a composer - pay the composer and presumably be able to hear the composers arrangement using tools - before committing to the IRL humans.\n\nI am a solodev ... I've got the cash to do what you're doing ... but I've no composer and very little time.\n\nSo, for me, AI is a godsend for what I'm doing.  I want to ask you an honest question.

The first couple of seconds are critical and it feels a bit slow, launch straight into the gameplay and make sure those cuts are sharp. \n\nMake sure to include at least 3/4 gifs of gameplay loops, no one reads these days so bright shiny gifs will help.\n\nI would suggest you try and increase the number of languages. If you can’t try and do a steam page in each different language it will get shown and people do understand if the game is in English even if they can’t understand it. But I would suggest trying to localise it.\n\nMake sure to get bundles with other games, this will be your sales tail. \n\nNaturally reach out to lots of streamers, you normally want to aim for 500-1000 emails, I know it’s a lot but it can really help with those wishlists.\n\nI notice you have controller support, make sure you do steam deck support too.",

We had big ambitions — a much larger ocean adventure inspired by One Piece.\n\nBut over time, things became difficult. Scope kept expanding, nothing solid was shipping, and the monthly burn rate was real. On top of that, health issues became a serious factor, and we eventually had to pause and step back.\n\nAfter that, I was alone again.\n\nThat’s when I went back to a small 1-week game jam prototype I had made before.\n\nInstead of asking “What world do I want to build?”\n\nI asked, “What can I realistically finish alone?”\n\nI love Raft, but 3D survival games make me motion sick.\n\nSo I removed movement.\n\nI turned the island into cards.\n\nI made decisions the core mechanic.\n\n\n\nCaptain Duck is basically the result of cutting scope until it was survivable — for both the player and for me.",

We’re two indie devs working on **Stunt Paradise 2**, a car-based racing platformer.\n\nRecently we rebuilt our engine audio system from scratch.  \nBefore, all cars shared a single engine sound. Now every car has its own engine audio, with new sound packs we picked and integrated individually.\n\nIt sounds simple on paper, but in practice there were lots of technical details:  \nRPM-based blending, transitions, tuning per vehicle, performance considerations, and making it feel responsive in gameplay.\n\nSo far this took \\~7 days of work, and it’s still not fully finished.  \nAny feedback is welcome!",

Driving a more rigid car feels a lot different but you guys still made it fun. Even though I keep trying to bunny hop ): \n\nThe regular tracks were fun to go through. I've always enjoyed finding the best lines and pushing the times. I hope their is some kind of leader board and timing system to compete with others on.\n\nThe trials is what I was more interested in and they didn't disappoint. You said their would be difficulty and I'm glad there is. Seeing and learning how you guys did the physics was great. Doing the more technical tracks in Trials and stuff like ninja was my favorite so I love that you included it on the 4th trials map. As well as stuff like throttle control and driving up walls. I hope there is even more difficult tracks in that vein. \n\nI was able to get the trophies on the first, second, and fifth trial. The third where you have to do two back flips feels a bit wonky. I felt like I did two flips multiple times, but maybe I just didn't finish the second full rotation. The fourth map is just pretty hard to string those jumps and climbs together quick, though I don't have too much experience on your game yet.\n\nThe biggest complaint I have is the saws. They feel incredibly punishing. Like a pixel could gently graze outside of one and my car would blow up. Maybe it would be worth letting cars get a bit closer to one without being hit by it would make it feel better and look better by having a close call. Or maybe I'm just bad lol. \n\nI'll def be getting the first game here soon and I will be looking forward to the seconds release. Sorry if this was disjointed or rambly, I don't normally write reviews or feedback.",

Watching it, it felt weird that it kept restarting the sound whenever the wheels would leave the track and then touch back down. Feels like two problems, one being the sound of the engine could use some variance to keep from being repetitive, especially on the loops where the wheels would touch down then briefly leave the track only to touch back down again. Two being the silence when in the air feels weird, even if it's realistic - which may be fine once there's music added. Also, I liked the slowmo a lot, especially with it not having like a wobbly on screen effect, very satisfying.\n\nTake all this with a grain of salt, as I haven't really played Trials and I'm not usually into these kinds of games. Still, I hope your game does well!!",

Perhaps a little grass could be present to create depth around the wheels.\n\nHowever what we could observe from this perspective are subtle reflections off the car windows and the surface of the car. Imagine the stuff you’re driving past is invisible to us but is reflected off the car. It doesn’t have to be much and it’ll create a sense of speed and movement to the car that isn’t currently present (at least when watching from my phone).\n\nI’d also increase contrast between the lit parts of the trees/background and the unlit parts. This way we focus more on the car and the speed of things moving towards it. \n\nThe trees closer to the car could also catch more light while the trees further in the background are less affected. Again this increases depth. \n\nAlso none of this lighting makes much sense in the physical world, but if you make it consistent the brain will buy it and like it.\n\nIf I’m making no sense let me know.\n\nEdit:\nWanted to add I like what I see already!

Its feeling very artificial and rigid because your camera is locked dead center on the car so you see the bumps in the road but you dont feel them, and you see it “touch” the ground but you dont hear or see it in any way that makes you go oh shit or ouch! Give the camera some lag when accelerating and lead time to see in front of it like youre a passenger in the car feeling the movement, bouncing on every bump and vibrating down the rocky dirt road ever so slightly. Show the body of the car getting scraped away with sparks and make sure players hear that grating nails on a chalk board, clanking breaking sound you never wanna hear in a car. And the car looks like its a beater so give it a fun engine noise to clank along the path with. ;)",

          "text": "Your proto looks really promising.  You might want to take a look at an early ‘80’s coin op game, Moon Patrol, that IREM did and Williams distributed.  The game play centered on trading your need to get somewhere fast with seeing far enough ahead of you to react to obstacles in your path. \n\nWith respect to making the van pop, I think the windows feel kind of painted on at present. It pulls the van out of the scene. if you made the widows tinted, darker but translucent with a small alpha, you’d see through to a darkened background. That would attach the van more to the environment.  Guess you’d also need a silhouette of a driver, since you can see into and through the van, that could bounce as van goes over bumps, details that may seem small but have an big subliminal impact on believability and a positive  surprise factor when the player realizes the detail on repeated play.\nAny kind of junk loosely strapped to the roof that can bounce around would be fun too.\nThe headlight cone, as an element that illuminates  much of the road ahead on the right side of the screen, can be a key part of game play strategy. Making the headlight cone brighter would make it pop, too, especially if you darken the foreground/under-road region.  in fact, if the areas outside of the headlight beams darkened in a gradient to the edges of the screen, player would feel more like they were driving “too fast”, or outrunning their headlights on a dangerous unfamiliar road.  The concern that something is liable to pop out from the dark could influence your game play as well as adding a level of suspense.\nYou can use forward visibility vs velocity in game play as well as giving the scene a cinematic sense. If the van position to the right of center, were based on the van’s absolute velocity with acceleration adding to/subtracting from the van’s current X-coordinate on the screen.  The van would move closer/farther from frame right, sort of outrunning the camera, as it accelerates but letting the camera catch up as it decelerates.  When braking, the camera would first outrun the van so that the van slid left in frame as you braked, returning to screen center as the brakes are released. The reduction of the amount of viewable road in front of you as you accelerate, and as van velocity climbed, would make the player have to balance speed with desire to see farther ahead down the road.\nTrying to keep the engine from blowing could be another variable in both play and visuals",

You could make the middle and rear windows a bit darker since those cabin lights wouldn’t be on. A slight green glow from the front window from the dash. The forest behind the van could have a slight red glow from the tail lights and then fade into more darkness, similar to how you have the headlights illuminating the trees at the front.",

      "text": "I made a huge mistake. I transferred an app(game) to a so-called publisher that ended up producing close to 0 results for the project, and then told me I needed to pay \"5-10k\" for them to transfer it back via steamworks.\n\nI worked on a game for more than 3 years when I got an email about a publishing offer.\n\nI had a video call in which the lead guy straight up told me to my face that he didn't think the game had any potential, but that they wanted to publish an unfinished game I had been working on previously. A huge red flag that I just didn't take seriously enough. I had been dealing with an unrelated hardship at the time, and I think it clouded my judgement here. I was desperate for help and just kind of went, \"What's the worst that can happen?\".\n\nSo I agreed to let them publish both games and they proceeded to 'run a marketing campaign'. I never really verified anything because I was overwhelmed dealing with something else (divorce, it was divorce).\n\nI did see wishlists go up, but it wasn't significant, and hard to know who to attribute them to because I was doing my own marketing effort. For all I know, their impact may have been 0.\n\nCommunication was sporadic, and ultimately unreliable. Chaotic, even.\n\nMy correspondent was either quitting, being replaced, or changing position within the company every week or two.\n\nLet me just say that I had launched a game before. Self-published. No real marketing.\n\nIt got about 23 reviews. It was my first game, and so that was a success for me.\n\nSkip forward to the release of this game, with the help of a \"publisher\", and... 4 reviews. Yeah. Yup, 4.\n\nIt's hard for anyone to foresee this, but they advised me to wait for a better release date, and while I waited, an indie game with a very similar name and theme launched. The \"what-ifs\" killed me for a while.\n\nA month went by and I heard nothing. I had to email them several times to get them to honor the first months payment. I was surprised when they actually did.\n\nTo work for more than 3 years on something and then to have to email and wait and wonder and email again and again before finally getting paid your scraps... yeah, I am never transferring an app to a publisher again.\n\nThe main guy assured me that they would send a revenue report at least once a month, then 4 months went by without a word from them. I decided I wouldn't be doing business with them and I wanted my game back. But of course, the guy refused, and said if I wanted it back I would have to buy it back for \"5-10k\".\n\nSo, I had Steam delist the game.\n\nThe name of the \"publisher\" is actually the most generic name possible: \"The Game Publisher\".\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nI am FlipswitchX on Twitch",

It sounds like you fell victim to a \"capable sales person\" and it sucks. There's a good chance there's no legal recourse for you, and unless the contract says otherwise there's no legal path for them to pursue you. So the best option might be to grieve your project and move on armed with this knowledge in the future. It can happen to anyone, and there's a reason these publishers target rookies.

So those that do contact you are in their overwhelming majority, thieves or scammers.\n2. READ your contract and make sure there is no clause there that will ever require you to pay anything! Even if the pub is solid and will sell thousands of copies for you, if they keep billing you for various \"services\", you will still make little to no money.\n3. Make sure that even if you signed a shit contract, they can enforce it. E.g. if you are in the EU and some murican pub made a contract that just screws you (there is no parity between their obligations and entitlements), ignore the contract and if they threaten, invite them to sue you - they won't, and if they do, contracts like that don't fly and you would win.\nSorry for you, but before paying anything, make sure you get a lawyer take a look at what you signed.

It's a shame this happens in industry more often than people think - especially to the newbie devs looking to break into the industry - hired, crunched to death, and spat back out. \n\nIt can be a tough lesson, but the industry has some really great things, too. Hopefully, you can smash out a new game in half the time and release it with more success 🙂",

I can't afford most things like a home, car, or degree (slowly getting through community college now), but I work extremely hard because I know this is what I want out of life. It is hard to watch people use this AI crap when it just ends up looking bad and coming off lazy and inhuman. I already struggled to get work, but between this and everything else it has only gotten harder.

It took me maybe 4 loops before I realized what the gameplay objective was for progression. Realizing the sound difference when messing up and being correct helped a bit more than the player character's reaction for me.

But if I were to go off of beats from a typical game, I'd go in assuming >!the reason for the game forcefully resetting you to floor 0 every fail means learning these anomalies will probably be important later on in the game, but if that's the case then having them RNG may help against brute forcing but does mean that if any are missed that the player may be lost if those future events do occur.!< If I am wrong and that is not the case, then >!if I were to play the game (which again, unlikely because I'm not a fan of the genre, I have no input on the quality of it in its niche), being knocked down to floor 0 when I'm not actually expected to learn these anomalies will feel more frustrating than not, especially when the things I need to spot are not apparent at all, I never did find out about the 'cut' anomaly!<\n\nAt the very least, I'd suggest a 'fast search' system when dealing with drawers and the like that you'd usually need to manually interact with. Like pressing a button on a cabinet would open each drawer quickly from the bottom and stopping upon either reaching the top or finding one with something inside of it. Would speed up the process and make the process of opening and closing each drawer feel less tedious.\n\nI hope I was of some help. Gl o/",

And, unless they can run into someone just as dedicated and crazy, they cannot find artists who would be OK with sharing part of that meager expected profit to contribute to the project.\n\nThus, the difference between number of employed people is positive at 1: using AI at least allows the solodev to produce something and earn a substandard living. Not using AI would mean the project is never completed, or that the solodev has to spend years mastering a huge range of skills. Not feasible for many of us, given the overhead costs of, you know, eating and shelter.\n\nTL;DR: It is a valid position to be against the use of AI for established studios with salaried workers, while simultaneously being OK with solodevs and small indie teams using AI where it is appropriate, with a promise of replacing the assets if they ever make a significant enough profit.",

              "text": "I’m pleasantly surprised you actually got net upvotes for that.\n\nI was just explaining this to someone earlier today. If you’re a solo dev, good goddamn luck doing everything yourself.\n\nI’m 47 years old and have devoted thousands upon thousands of hours to learning skills that have nothing to do with my day job, the one that actually pays the bills. I can do 2D and 3D art. I can do modeling and texturing. I’ve got a sound studio in a room in my house and can play four instruments, so I can make music. I can code and use frameworks. I can do technical writing and layouts. I can create and tell a story that holds interest because I’ve read thousands of books and DM/GM’d pen and paper games for decades.\n\nBut I made a game, I poured a thousand plus hours into it, and it’s *kind of okay*. Totally original concept. Didn’t use AI. Didn’t use anything off an asset store. Credited some free sounds, a couple textures, and used some public domain/CC0 images (thank you JPL), but made a lot of stuff myself from scratch. The game is alright. It’s fine. It’s fun. I’ve got a handful of people I don’t even know saying they love it (they’re too kind). But it’s *not* great. I know that. I’m okay with that. I’m one guy with nothing but time invested because I did virtually *all* of it myself and I’m charging less than 5 bucks for it. If I make $1000 in sales it’ll be a miracle. So I’m making maybe a dollar an hour on my labor, if I get lucky. And that’s okay because I love what I do.\n\nThere are professional artists out there charging $100-$1000 PER IMAGE. Maybe they’re worth it, I don’t know. It’s irrelevant because I’m not hiring that guy to work on my game, sorry, I need to feed my kids. I don’t care if I barely make any money on a game I wanted to make so I could play it. What I won’t do is put a second mortgage on my house to bring in specialists to make a game that might just fail anyway.\n\nThis whole self-righteous indignation people get toward solo/indie devs using AI for *anything* is absolutely ridiculous. 99 indie games out of 100 use cheap asset flips, AI generated stories or images, AI generated code. And those guys get flamed. Someone uses none of it, *all* their own skills, and they barely make any sales because the bottom line is that their skills *aren’t that good* because they have to be a jack-of-all-trades.\n\nPeople expect small-team indie and solo devs to just eat costs and somehow turn out professional studio-level games without using AI in any form, and that shit is ridiculous. 99.99% of the time they’ll make a decent game at best that makes a few grand and show’s over.\n\nAs someone with near 1000 games in my Steam library of which probably 90% are out of indie and solo devs, I’m here to say right now that I don’t give a single smoldering fuck if you’re a solo dev or small indie team and you used AI in your game… Especially if it’s not immediately obvious that you did. Inpainted a dozen times and then loaded the image into photoshop or similar and touched it up for 15-20 mins, an hour, to make it look decent? *Great*! So you used AI… Who cares? The same people complaining about a solo dev using locally hosted AI on their PCs to generate some images are jumping on Google and crushing some compute in a data center just to find out about their favorite celebrity’s pastimes.\n\nAI is being used in professional-quality everything from movies and tv shows to music to photography to actual art by actual artists and people don’t even know it. The newest versions of Photoshop and Davinci Studio and Ableton and even MS flippin office *use AI*. These are the software tools that that $1000 per image or song or whatever professional I mentioned earlier is using. Don’t believe me? Slot any of those things into “How does ________ use AI” in a Google search and *another AI* will tell you all the many different ways.\n\nAI is literally everywhere now, being used professionally in every industry. The people designing your fridges and cars and couches and TVs are using AI. The people laying out roads and building bridges are using AI. People making 3D assets and textures and sound effects are using AI. Your $1000 per image artist is using AI. Entire governments of staffers are using AI. Why should solo and indie devs hobble themselves and go it alone when *everybody* else is using AI?\n\nI don’t know where I’m going with this. It just rubs me the wrong way seeing people get shit on for using AI to do what they love. As a solo dev you basically just can’t win. As I said, I didn’t use AI in my last game, but I can tell you that my *next* game is going to use AI. Because *not* using it is *not* worth it. We need every edge we can get, and our time is valuable too.",

I've seen an over reliance of AI coding tools amongst my fellow students, some of whom had full blown panic attacks when we had a closed book C programming exam. AI coding is an absolutely horrible thing when used in situations where one has no idea about the code it's generating, and most of my classmates are incapable of coding anything above a Hello World script in C alone, even after two years studying the language.\n\nRecently, my company had a push to try out AI for a certain project we had. It was an order from the higher ups to use it as much as possible and compare productivity. It was incapable of building certain systems given that they were simply too complex to implement over a large existing codebase for the AI. That being said, it did help with certain tedious tasks. Simple unit tests and optimising java streams were some of these tasks. I can't say it's not helpful at times.\n\nI don't mind AI code gen when it's something tedious I'm capable of doing but want to save some time. I don't care for the project being 100% free of AI code gen. Sometimes the IDE suggests exactly what you want to write, and it wouldn't make sense retyping it yourself. My only gripe with AI usage is when it's front facing. When something like art or voice overs could've been a job for someone and yet the AI does it for free. \n\nI also hate when people completely generate a game from scratch using AI with zero idea how to code, but that's my pet peeve to live with atp.",

Modern development is less and less about code as written and more about coordination between teams and devs, writing good user requirements, writing good tests, etc (at least I'm the application space, I'm not a games dev). Every step along the way of compilers, language improvements, intellisense, auto-complete has been in pursuit of making it easier to describe the behavior as a human would without worrying about the underlying computer functioning.\n\nI have immense respect for the earliest coders and think there are some programs that rise to the level of art themselves, but those are the exceptions. Everything else feels a pile of building code violations if you think of programs like houses. The vast majority of AI feels like bringing ourselves to the level of ”i bought my paint, canvas, and paintbrush instead of making them myself\" but without replacing ourselves as the painters. Yet.\n\nI think gen AI images still suck and the bubble sucks and the impact to human job markets is going to really really suck. That said, programming AI is it's own niche with it's own considerations.",

Standing poses are not that hard to find references for, but the second one tells me that I can make a lot more specific poses that are a lot harder to find with a Google search.\n\nIf I still worked professionally as an artist, I would absolutely be interested in the second one, but probably scroll pass the first one without really looking.\n\nMight want to ask in an artist forum as well (that would allow those kind of questions), just to see if you get different answers than you would get here.",

Without that, it sort of looks like a medical model for education, not immediately clear that you can pose the model yourself.\n\nThe name is a bit clunky, I'd drop the \"3D Max\" part of it, which doesn't add anything unless you're trying to get found via accidental searches for 3DS Max lol.

I do like the warm image of them hanging out together though haha",

Daz Studio is a free and very capable software which will do what you want to do, built for photorealism renders nowadays but its roots are firmly tied to Poser.\n\nIf it doesn't work for you, fair enough but go have a play with it. Might just be what you need.",

I immediately checked through the different options in your top key art, and didn’t feel the same reaction to the second one simply because they all get lost in the single figure. I would have glossed over it because I’d believe it wouldn’t be exactly what I was interested in.\n\nSaying that, what I WOULD be exactly interested in, is a mode like the first mannequin one, but with harder defined planes breakdown for everything. I find that style of dummy much more intuitive for 2d art than any ‘smooth drawing mannequin’ style or ‘very realistic anatomy’",

It's memorable and funny, but still shows all the classic drawing figures so I get the point that this is a drawing app - but this one pulls a feeling of curiosity.\n\nThe other one is better if the brand you're going for is Very Serious Program For Adult Professionals™  \nMore classic marketing than modern I'd say.
