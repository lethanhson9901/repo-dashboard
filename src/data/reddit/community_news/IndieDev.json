          "text": "I am an instructor on Udemy and I have \\~50k students. At some point I decided to make free courses to attract more people and it was a mistake. My free courses would get a lot of 1 star reviews, mean time paid content would mostly get 5 star reviews.  In the end, I just had to take down all free content because it was effecting my overall instructor rating. I think it's in the psychology or something. My wife tells me, when people pay for things, they are less likely to complain because if they do, they sort of admit that they did not spend money wisely and it would make them fools.  I just think people are taking a lot for granted and do not appreciate other's people work.  \n  \nI swear man, you start giving away gold, some of them folks will complain it's to heavy to carry",

It's becoming a lot more common than it used to be, but you'll see all sorts of items including games routinely priced at 60% off. A $100 new release on a time limited 60% off sale is generally thought to sell better than the same game with zero discount at 40$. However too high a discount can give the opposite effect of making the product seem defective or discounted because it's not worth full price. It's a balancing act, but marketing has had to come a long way since the Henry Ford Era where consumers didn't have a lot of choice.",

For a paid game, its great. They released it for free on steam where anyone could review it, so flavor of the week gamers who might hate this type of game ended up reviewing it. If they had kept it behind a paywall, only people who like this specific genre of game wouldve committed and bought it, and ultimately wouldve been satisfied. They try to do paid AND free (which was a watered down version) and it just made the free players angry. \n\nEven though its completely free! So yeah.

I'll give you a real life example, my brother owns a traditional small restaurant in our area, a mere ~0.25$ difference (3-10$ meals) from our competitors caused the \"low value crowd\" to burst at the seams with anger 💢 \"how dare you charge so much I'll go next door for 100fils less!\" AND THEY ACTUALLY DID, and since then what happened? No more random self entitled level of complaints, way more polite customers, and largely well praised for quality of food and the irony, the value.\n\nWhat happened was that tiny difference was enough to completely change the economic and social background of the customer base.\n\nChances are, you might be attracting younger learners, even children, when you make it free versus paid, because an adult is a lot more likely to value their time enough to pay for a quality course that helps them learn something a lot faster than if they were to self learn it \"for free\". Whereas a kid wouldn't care so much about the time factor and would care more about you being entertaining to watch, which might be a difficult thing to do if they're comparing you to Youtubers and such. You could also be having a case of completely different countries' citizens being your audience at free.\n\nMy advice is to tailor your offers to the target audience you wish to retain, a free offer might sound more enticing in your head than 25% off or giving some thank-you perk with the course or such, but if it's changing the demographic of who's becoming your student then it's useless if not damaging advertising. Large corporations cater to different audiences by creating different product lines for each, not by muddying the one line trying to make it fit them all.",

I've spoken and worked with a lot of people who do small scale, local work, in particular a piano instructor of mine was willing to talk about how he decides what to charge. The universal truth is you have to meet people's expectations, and they have certain expectations at certain price points. \n\n\nThe developers of the game Peak did a statement talking about how they came up with the price of the game and it actually is a good analysis of what a consumer thinks when seeing price points. Being free does have an ironic expectation nowadays to be able to buy some micro transactions to fix something you don't like about a product. However don't forget bots are plentiful out there, it may seem unlikely but review bombing to tarnish competitors is still a thing, just like review bloating (bots spamming good reviews, don't know the technical term) is a thing. Being free does unfortunately invite that kind of traffic.",

Get nothing done. \n\nI guess another would be a game you didn't like but want to finish. For me was god of war 3. The game was not fun. Was just brutal visuals. And cool cutscenes. That was mainly it. Had stupid hard puzzles, like why does a brawler game have puzzles??? Combat was spam triangle -_- I changed the difficulty cuz it was so boring. The fantasy was cool, I'm not arguing that, but the gameplay itself was a lot of nothing 😅 I could not wait to finish it. I was also very sad that my young cousin saw me play it and started crying. I tried to keep him away from seeing it he snuck inside. Game were just so much better in PlayStation 2. PS3 just started to be all about graphics but no gameplay",

If the game was free then there is no incentive to stick with it to get past that wall of content. If you already paid for it, you are more likely to push through so as not to waste your money.\n\nImagine getting the entire works of Agatha Christie as a gift. Being given each book one by one year after year would be fine but getting the whole lot in one go? That's a lot of reading ahead. If you had bought it for yourself then you went in knowing what you were signing up for but as a gift? Where do you start? Do you even like her books? Do you like them enough to read the whole set or do you try one and decide it's just too much and give up?\n\nI would never give a negative review over something like this but I understand why people might object to it even if I don't believe they should give a negative review for such a reason as the issue is in their head rather than with the product itself.",

Then, you can tell the difference between small enemies which get more vibrant as a whole as you approach, sooner, and large enemies who get vibrant more \"slowly\" because they are actually further away, (and also as they get close eg their feet will become vibrant before their head which is further away)\n\nAnother way of indicating this that I like, is to have certain enemy characteristics that stay the same size even when the enemy variant is larger - eg they all have the same-sized face and nuts-and-bolts accoutremonts that appear relatively smaller for the comparatively larger variant. However, this requires having encountered the enemy before to become effective.\n\nAlso, don't forget that you can use this illusion of \"I cant tell if that is a normal enemy up close or a titan far away\" can actually be used for practical and deliberate effect - imagine you have them fight a bunch of half-sized enemies, then a you-sized enemy, then you see off in the distance eg what appears to be a regular enemy with a pack of half-pints, but as you walk towards them, they aggro and as they get closer, the fog shifts and suddenly you realize, those arent half-pints, and the guy commanding them is a titan, and you are not prepared for this...\n\n(Minor edit for clarity)",

Everything is built of just planes with sprited on them, so they are actual 3D meshes, but.. just planes at different depths. This gives a small feeling of 3D, while keeping the game very simple when it comes to graphics etc.\n\nYour implementation looks very cool. I'm fascinated how animating that thing will work out.",

If I were on your team, I'd be disappointed seeing this post.

But I got paired with a friend that lived around the block, just me and him. We didn't even have a full team. But somehow, we figured out it would be a good idea to present it as a sock puppet show. We spent weeks making the puppets and the stage and rehearsing. It was very clever and in the end, we killed it! But when it came to standing in front the class as a young freshman who strived to fit in...I faltered. As we got up to do our presentation, I said \"now comes the embarrassing part\" out loud. We do our presentation, absolutely nail it, and get some genuine applause from the audience. And then the teacher gave us her feedback. B+, she would have given us an A+ if I hadn't said what I said in the beginning. I was sooo salty about that moment for so long (I'm sorry for the grade, Mike). A full letter grade, just for my comment? But as an adult, I understand now. Don't denigrate your work because you might be embarrassed of how other people will see it. Be proud that you put forth the effort.",

Or some stuff from cult of lamb; both of those seem to be in the same style of SVG-ish artwork.  But their stuff stands out more to me immediately.\n\nHope it goes well!

I would advice taking it all to a more cartoony/realistic style whichever fits better, and I would remove the gradient on the title which would make the inconsistency less prevalent.\n\nThe new banner is so much better by the way, the cat no longer looks like a 3d model and it has so much life, as a fan of puzzle games this looks super interesting!\n\nAs a final opinion, I think you don't need the \"cat\" on the title, as I think it is already pretty self explanatory and it just makes it longer",

Mostly because it is not worth it.\n\nI know what is not worth cleaning up because of experience. Some things that I didn't clean hurt badly later. If I wanted to make the same mistake again, I would have a solid reason to do it.\n\nThese are not rules. Rather good practices. If devs don't use them, it means that they (devs) know what they are doing because of the experience, or they just don't know why they would like to use them because of the lack of experience.\n\nIt is not the latest trend. I'd say that self-documenting code is with us for a long time (like 10-15 years), and it is more trendy nowadays to comment your code because it is much easier to not care about clean code.",

Same in my job.\n\nSelf-documenting code is not only about simple clean-code principles like consistent and intuitive naming convention and short functions/methods. There are more things like domain modelling (and implementing it), design patterns, OOP (or any other paradigm you use), or software architecture in general.\n\nFor example: why would you need such a variable? Looks like a code smell, suggesting that the issue lies somewhere else, and the need for something like this one is just an unfortunate side effect. Now you can comment it (duct tape fix) or redesign your code.\n\nPersonally, I think that in-line comments are ok only if your code is hard to read by design - like complex math or not-human-readable algorithms. In such cases, it should be encapsulated into a black box that you won't touch too often, along with the inline comments.\n\nTop-level documentation, on the other hand, may be useful to introduce new devs. If needed.\n\nSometimes when I worked on team projects, and I had a requirement to document everything, my docs were mostly the same as the methods/functions/classes signatures because there was no need to add more info.",

It stands out better, and more importantly will stand out muuuuch more on the Steam store than the old one because plenty of games have hills, grass, trees, blue sky and clouds in the background. Could have the dice be more visible in it, and have a thicker outline on the logo to make it stand out. I would also suggest making one “Die” in the logo look different from the other (be it colour or incorporating dice colours for one of them) so it makes it more obvious it’s not talking about the same use of the word twice. \n\nOtherwise I really like it and would check the game out if I saw it on Steam :)",

The colours pop without screaming “look at me!”, the dynamic poses look much better and show some real artistic skill. Is it busy? Yes. But I get the feeling that’s intentional to show the feel or energy of the game. And if it’s legible on a fraction of a phone screen it’ll be fine on a handheld pc or TVs/monitors as long as the logo doesn’t blend into the background, which I think either a thicker outline, or better yet, an slightly angular background to it.\n\n… so as you probably noticed, I wrote this out and decided to quickly doodle (on my phone via my finger lol) what changes I’d make. I’d mayyybe make the border around the logo even thicker than this, but I’m not sure, and I’ve added a couple more dice closer to where eyes are naturally drawn to, to make the dice aspect more noticeable.\n\nI’d recommend playing around with any ideas that stood out to you that everyone has suggested though! It’s your art! :)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jpoe2gc9hofg1.jpeg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be77d00bb34ef3c26f490146d3ce29d11494e985",

Opt for a background with very little going on to really set the coloured and detailed elements apart. Maybe a darker colour to mke everything pop. I also feel the name of the game gets lost a bit, so try and give it more prominence. You've got a solid base to work from, so time to hammer it home.",

Days by days I see game developers don't know how to make game for gamers (including yours). That's because they're making a copycat instead of solving the problem. If you play Stardew Valley and Expedition 33, both of them save the problem that video game in that genre had (stardew valley solved farming simulator problem, and Expedition 33 solved turn based RPG problem. Meanwhile yours just copycat, like it just \"another Flappy Bird\" clone. But your game is just another Assassin Creed. Your game DOES NOT solve anything stealth game had. Your game is just action game with stealth feature, not a stealth game. There is no hook. That's my 2 cents. Anyway, I play stealth game since '98",

You play as a grounded take on Red Riding Hood, raised by the Huntsman who saved her in an ancient, shared fairytale world that doesn’t care about you.\n\nGameplay-wise, we focus heavily on feel: movement, archery, melee, stealth, and encounters that react to how you approach them rather than forcing one solution (a lot of what my post talks about is us throwing work away to get that right).\n\nStory is character-driven but unfolds slowly through the world rather than big exposition dumps. You’re not saving the world out of the gate, you’re just trying to survive it, and then bigger consequences emerge over time based on how you play.\n\nTargeting release on Steam (PC & Mac, PS5, Xbox, and Switch 2). We’re still in the middle of it, but that’s the honest shape of it.",

I like that even with that success you weren’t complacent and wanted to go a step further and challenge yourself with making a game.

I went to college and got a medical degree but I’m currently working a 9-5 that I just don’t enjoy. I REALLY want independence and financial success from my own ideas. I can’t stop thinking about wanting to make my own indie game but I know it will be a bigger undertaking than I realize. I would say my idea is less ambitious than your game because it’s a sidescroller like Limbo and Inside…so that gives me some hope that I CAN pull this dream off. I am self taught in everything I do. I never give up when I try difficult things. My plan is to just do lots of research and make sure I tackle the development in the right order and learn as efficiently as I can while I move forward. Do you think I can pull off an indie game like Limbo or Inside?\n\nI wish you all the luck and success in your game Tale’s Edge!",

Via my experience, 99% of Reddit is that.\n\nA Steam game published with negative reviews isn’t exactly a dis-qualifying resume. A number of devs have lousy Steam reviews, but have great talent; they just didn’t have a great idea or popular game.\n\nYour experience sounds a lot like mine. I spent a year trying to get a multiplayer game going with “salesmen” devs, only to get examples and demos, but nothing advancing my game. \n\nI luckily/accidentally found a dev who was a 15 year Unity multiplayer dev with a busted early access game who delivered in a week, what the “Salesmen” devs couldn’t do in a year. \n\nIt’s amazing what you can find if you know what to look for. You need recommendations, I can refer some to you.  They do in a week what “salesmen” devs take months. They don’t BS, they deliver. If you are sitting around waiting for progress.

Most likely the dev was stuck because of your other issues with a lack of direction.  Hindsight is 20/20, and a new dev coming in has a much better foundation to work from than the first one who was prototyping constantly.\n\nMost people hire from AAA talent because they think the finished games on their resume are more of an accomplishment than someone with a long running game.  The reality is most devs in AAA had a small part of the process.  Not saying that’s what you replaced them with, just that it’s a common pitfall and usually what a PM like yourself would react with.\n\nIt’s an interesting read overall, but I think your analysis of the situations shows you still have a lot more to learn.  It’s a good thing you come from money, because it’s going to be an expensive learning experience.  Good luck, and I look forward to reading more in the future to see how you grow as a PM.",

The softer right edge of the front plane doesn't make sense visually for me on C.  \n\n\nThird, the vacuum formed packaging around toys is easier to see right next to them since the translucent material is parallel to the camera's view, essentially being a thicker material. The outline on B and D reflects that expectation with the grey outline. The drop shadow on A is also really nice, but I feel like D looks more like packaging at a glance. A would feel a bit like a toy from the 80s or 90s where its free-floating in the packaging, attached with a plastic or wire tie.",

You should pay close attention to your sales per country and amount of reviews/comments you get from certain areas to figure out what translations to focus on. Could also make a deal with a regional publisher and make localization a part of the deal, like for the chinese market for example",

                  "text": "In that case, maybe focusing on a few strategic languages first rather than localizing Gem Miner into a dozen of them could actually make things much more manageable. Spanish, French or Chinese, for example, could give you access to big new player bases without multiplying the workload in every direction at once.\n\nThe “giant job” feeling usually comes from trying to think about localization as one huge, all‑or‑nothing step. If you approach it as a staged process, starting with one or two key languages and maybe just the most visible / high‑impact content (UI, tutorial, store page, early game), you can keep development moving while still opening the game to more players.\n\nOn the “nightmare to manage” side, a lot depends on how your text is structured rather than on the number of languages. Once your strings are properly identified and exportable, updates become incremental instead of a full redo every time something changes. That also helps reduce the risk of those small translation errors that break immersion, because you have clearer context and a stable base to work from.\n\nAs a professional freelance translator working from English into French and specialized in video games, **I** could also help by answering any questions you might have about the process or advising you on how to set up a workflow that fits your current way of developing the game.",
