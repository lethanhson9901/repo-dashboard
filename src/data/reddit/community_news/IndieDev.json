So yeah, I mean obviously I know you're using some type of water generator object that's infinitely generating water... but to me that looks really off.",

Love the artistic style and the water looks especially rad!   \n  \nOne thing I'd expect to see is the ability to place down randomized clusters of foliage. So like, instead of just a single bush or tree, there is an area of effect circle that can paint a bunch of stuff down at once, so to speak. Speed up the process of placing things down, but then having the ability to delete and move individual objects. \n\nAnd then as others have said, having a way to plant specific trees or shrubs that could then attract certain types of animals would be really cool. It could even be almost like a tech-tree, where you plant a certain type of berry, which brings small birds and deer to the island, or you plant trees close to the water, giving places for sea life to create homes in which attracts cranes or dolphins. \n\nthis last idea would be a lot and probably beyond the scope, but something I've always wanted to see in a game like this is the ability to speed up time by x10000, so you can watch the world change from erosion and weather and see a simulation of what your island would look like 1,000,000 years into the future in 100 seconds. You'd probably be doing PhD levels of research in order to implement a simulation on that scale but would be really cool. \n\nAll in all, keep up the awesome work! Looking forward to seeing future posts about this! :D",

I have a design model that would complement this system very well.\n\nSome time ago, I started developing a strategy game using Unity and C#, but it eventually became too much for me to handle. The core idea was to combine **Earth’s climates and seasons** to drive location-based behavior and controlled randomness across multiple systems: **fauna, flora, resources, and characters**.\n\nThe goal wasn’t pure randomness, but a structured variability grounded in geography and time. Climate zones and seasonal changes would act as the underlying framework, influencing what could appear, evolve, or be generated in each area of the world.\n\nEven though I didn’t finish that project, the conceptual model still feels solid to me, and I can clearly see how it could integrate naturally with systems like this one.",

This simple yet brilliant idea made me cry for a few seconds.\n\nA bit of context to explain that feeling better:\nI’m a senior software developer, and I wanted to try some 3D programming. I started three months ago with the Unity Learning Path, and I literally devoured those tutorials as if I had always known how to use the engine. I was extremely happy and felt certain that I would create something cool in my free time.\nSince then, other aspects of my life have been getting harder day by day (relationships, health, money, etc.), and I quickly lost motivation. I realized that I can’t control bad times, but I can keep my mind away from negative thoughts by continuing to improve my personal skills to avoid depression.\nI wanted to find an idea that could bring me back to the old days, when everything was good and problems didn’t exist in my life. I wanted, somehow, to go back to my childhood, but I found nothing....only darkness, like my thoughts. And then your post appeared… and yes, that’s exactly what I was looking for. This really brought me back to my childhood!\nThis somehow turned on the lights again in my mind, and that alone is a W.\n\nThank you for this, with all my heart ❤️",

This means that the world is really a finite region that tesselates well. Also it's insanely laggy to render offsets more than 8ish times in each direction, so you can detect the offsettinv by seeing how they deal with distant repeats, which will usually be a white void etc. By the way,   when rendering offsets, one teleporrs the camera to the opposite wall of the finite region whenever they touch it, so that you can't reach the white boundary, maintaining the illusion of moving around in an infinite space",

When you imagine lumberjacks twisting a log in opposite directions, it feels like the log should make a full 360-degree rotation. But in reality, if you actually do this, the log stays in place, because it’s a single object and its two ends aren’t independent of each other. Once I realized this, I understood that I had to break some physics rules. After all “it’s just a game” 😅",

Simply by looking at the gameplay, the difficulty seems pretty high (I’m not a frequent bullet-hell player though), maybe scale it down a notch if this is intended to be an early enemy?\n- Currently, projectiles appear instantly on screen and move with constant speed. Have you tried fading them in just slightly (smoother entrance) and telegraphing some projectiles by first showing them still, then easing to full speed (vs. instant full speed)?\n\nKeep up the great work!",

Every other encounter is optional and serves as preparation for the final the boss. When you beat an enemy you get a currency which you can spend to either heal or increase your base stats.\n\nThis allows the player to tweak the difficulty of the game while playing. However, I design all enemies to be very challenging at Level 1. That said the pattern you saw in the demo is not final as I'm still developing the game.\n\nAs for your second point, thanks for the suggestion. I'll consider it.",

Maybe the old one was the one you actually were originally using, but the new one is also AI generated but I guess visually more appealing...\n\nSo you put that together and posted here. Then to drive up the engagement, you've been responding with \"Okay!\" and \"Ok I see\", nonsense filler replies to a lot of people's genuine comments, because you're under the false impression that by doing this, you're driving up engagement on your post and therefore it will perform better for the algorithm or something.\n\nI have some bad news for you (and good news for honest game devs), this is not going to work. Your game is not going to become successful because you use lazy methods of engagement farming to up the numbers on your posts. All you've done is created a mildly \"successful\" reddit post. Which means absolutely nothing for your game sales.\n\nIf I were you, I'd spend less time on engagement farming for upvotes and comment counts, and more time polishing your game and improving the art style. Because the characters in your actual gameplay footage look nothing like either of the characters in your AI generated capsule art images.\n\nFor some reason they are just incredibly generic placeholder characters, and then your actual character has a robot arm?\n\nYou're doing game dev all wrong. It's like you're trying to pump out an asset flip, then prop it up solely on engagement bait social media posts, hoping that somehow all of that will generate lots of sales and you'll be a successful indie dev without actually making a good game.",

The cards were rotated towards the viewer and spread out in an easy to read manner. In the final image the hand placement is almost lost at the top of the composition, harder to read and competing in interest with all the red elements.\n\nIf this is a card's game the capsule should make it obvious. If it were me, I'd rotate the king's arm so the hand stays around the negative space below the K (of the King's title). Also I'd make the cards bigger and spread out like they were in your sketch.

The point of the capsule has always been to sell a concept/genre + a feeling, not to show the game. That's what the screenshots are for, and they show up when you hover.\n\nWhat can happen sometimes is that the capsule seems to sell the wrong feeling or is just too much of a mismatch stylistically.\n\nCompositionally, the new one is absolutely better, and it does look a lot more polished and professional, but the style is so devoid of texture that it looks \"bland\" or generic, something common in art that's \"too clean\" or made with AI (not saying it is AI). I think that's why comments say they miss the charm of the first one. However, that doesn't mean the solution is to use the old one as is. A new capsule in a different style or even a touch-up on this capsule will usually still look better.\n\nUsing in-game art without enough editing or *some* artistic knowledge usually ends up looking unpolished and as a result gives the impression that THE GAME is not polished, even though it very well could be!\n\nCharm is good, but you do NOT want your Steam page to look \"amateurish\" regardless of if you are Indie or not. Your capsule is supposed to be the best version of the game, not the one with most fidelity.",

It is the reason I despise AI generated imagery to begin with, and it is *glowing* here.\n\nCompare with your screenshot, only the over-the-shoulder belt has a buckle, while the horizontal does not (I'd even assume it's just a waistband, not a leather belt). Now look closer at the belts themselves, look at the *holes*: they are absolutely not uniform in any way that would be reasonable even for a beginner artist, let alone someone demanding that kind of money. The bottom belt has two holes squeezed into the tail, the top belt has  just one. The top belt has four holes setting up a pattern, and there *should* be a fifth hole on the shoulder before it flips out of sight, and because there's a hole on the other end of the vertical belt, there's no \"there are only 4 holes and then it stops\" excuse (unless you think that it's a weird belt that has only 4 holes and then a random hole near the end?). \n\nLastly, I want to draw your attention to the eye shine. The irises are the correct shape, but the shines in each of the eyes are very different (left eye shine is entirely contained inside the iris, right eye shine is 50% inside 50% outside; each of those are correct choices in their respective rights, but I don't think I've ever seen anyone mix them). You can only see it by really zooming in.\n\nTl;dr what I'm saying is, a stranger on the internet is 100% convinced you've been ripped off.",

I would recommend checking out his fiver page and see how consistent the art style is, and then maybe wander over to r/isthisai or something and check out some AI generated examples, zoom in on the details the same way you did here.

The visuals are just stunning, and the intro and everything is very mysterious so great job! It seems your goals are being met. What made me very happy was the local multiplayer mode. I am a huge fan of multiplayer games (I have 5 brothers and 3 sisters, and we often play games together). The audio is great and hitting things is very juicy.\n\nOne note I had was with the splash screen. I've been told that sometimes the Unity splash screen gives people a bad impression because so many trash games were made with it. This might be outdated information but maybe look into that and consider slightly changing it up a bit? Don't get me wrong I love Unity but that's just what I've been told.",
