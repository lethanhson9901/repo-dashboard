To keep the feeling of them dancing, I would have each arm initially launch away from the stopped position pretty quickly, and then de-accelerate to a near stop with each movement. Never have them come to a complete stop, tho. The moment before they would stop completely, they quickly accellerate the opposite direction.

          "text": "I like the concept and style of the statues a lot! Mechanically though this doesn't seem very interesting - you just have to jump on a hand-platform when it's nearby, then wait for it to swap to another position and immediately jump to the nearest hand-platform. That's not much of a puzzle and not very interactive. It could be more fun with other movement abilities (air dash, double jump, etc.) but I don't know what you have planned for that.\n\nPerhaps it'd be more interesting if the hands moved along non-linear paths, tracing circles and shapes in the air, and only came close to one another mid-movement - so you have to pay attention and time your jumps, instead of waiting for it to stop and jumping to the next hand straight away. Those could even be \"alternate\", harder, but faster routes through the same section.\n\nThe hands could also rotate, throwing you off at specific points in the dance, for an additional challenge and bit of visual interest.\n\nYou might want to make it so you can customise the dance of each statue individually, if you haven't already, since otherwise there's a limited number of ways you can implement them for movement and they'd get repetitive and boring otherwise.\n\nHaving the dances synced up with beat/hits in the music would be really great too. I imagine you have that planned, but haven't finished making the music yet lol\n\nAnd as other commenters have said, the movements are faster and jerky - making them a bit slower could work, as could having them accelerate/decelerate instead of moving a constant speed. Personally I think them moving at a slower but constant speed would work well, and could give the vibe of stone mechanisms grinding slowly against each other that would feel/look good. Having the arms/hands shudder a little at the start and end of each movement, and maybe some dust falling from them as they do would help sell the movement a lot imo.\n\nAh, and I also think the \"Encore!\" on every jump is a bit obnoxious too lol",

          "text": "Really pleasing art style. I agree with a few other commenters that this gameplay brings strong classic **Rayman** and **LittleBigPlanet** platformer puzzle vibes. Those games are pure nostalgia.\n\nWhat’s working well is the overall colour palette and the cooldown moment after a high-intensity chase. That contrast lands nicely. There’s definitely room to push the gameplay experience a bit further though.\n\n1. Building on what others have mentioned, the dancer hands currently move without much sense of weight. A simple fix would be adding ease in and ease out to the animations. Varying the hand timings slightly would also make the section feel more engaging instead of repetitive. You could introduce additional moving platforms, like vertical lifts or rotating elements, to help bridge gaps between statues. As a bonus, having some hands wobble or drop small bits of rubble before moving would help players anticipate jump timing and make the sequence feel more grounded in the underground setting.\n\n2. The ENCORE multiplier feels a bit like a work-in-progress mechanic right now. The UI isn’t prominent enough and doesn’t clearly communicate its function beyond the clink sound. Once the gameplay is locked in, spending more time polishing this with clearer icons, stronger contrast from the background, and slightly flashier visual feedback tied to sound would really help. Multipliers fading out after a few seconds could also keep things readable.\n\n3. Sound design and music choice could add a lot to this puzzle section. Using audio to reinforce the cooldown tempo after the chase would introduce another layer of immersion.\n\n4. As an extra touch, considering how dynamic the chase camera is, having the camera subtly react to player movement in this section could enhance the flow even further.\n\nHope these feedbacks help ya, OP. All the best with incorporating these and we're looking forward to your next post update!",

Honestly it’s kind of funny because when my passion for games came back, I had a much greater appreciation for blockbuster games; I could see the artistry in trying to make something that appeals to the masses.\n\nI still prefer to play indie games, and when Im playing for enjoyment I almost always play smaller games; my steam list almost looks like a 12 yearold whose parents only buy cheap shovelware games lol. \n\nBut I play AAA games out of curiosity, and to learn things, also to play with friends online.\n\nIt comes back :)",

The creature on the left is almost disarmingly innocent with its seated position. \n\nI would say use that to make your decision. Is your game more mature? Or is it kind of playful. You could even use either interchangeably if moods shift. I'm reminded of the Starman model from *Earthbound/Mother* series. Where the games have a serious edge to them, but are mostly playful experiences. But that could be heaps more work.",

But yeah, the best idea is to address it as soon as you're ready to leave the prototyping stage.\n\n\nFor some games, save/load is no big deal. For some games, it's *horrifically* entangled with absolutely *everything* and will force you to rethink the way literally every item of game data is managed. (It's a lot like \"adding multiplayer\" in this respect.)\n\n\nAn extreme example of how insane save/load can get is Bethesda games. Look at what they can do. You can be in the middle of an action, jumping through the air, knocking over a pile of potatoes, quest status in mid-update on your UI, hit save, quit, start, load up again, and boom, you're right back in the middle of all that stuff like nothing happened. Think about how many systems and how many totally different object states that kind of perfect, frozen-in-time snapshot cuts across. Not every save system is this ambitious, but if you've never fully thought through the system you have in mind, you'll probably be surprised how much it forces you to rethink and refactor things.\n\n\nYou'll realize very quickly that \"save points\" are just a huge hack invented by game developers to simplify save/load logic. If you can only ever save at very specific points, and all mutable level state resets to default when you load-- i.e. you can just load a fresh level from scratch every time and drop your player into it as-is-- then you can get away without having to think very hard about your save system.",

          "text": "Save system has been by far the most challenging thing for me to wrap my head around. I'm building a FPS Metroidvania, so having to find a way to save every item and ability you pick up, every scripted sequence you've previously interacted with, the percentage of items collected, which doors you've destroyed or objects you've altered. This stuff really is no joke and I'm genuinely terrified of it because of what my save game blueprints in Unreal currently look like.\n\nBeen creating Boolean variables for every object to save and put into the game instance (so the GI and Save Game Blueprint ALL HAVE VARIABLES FOR ALL 250 ITEM PICKUPS IN THE GAME) and I think I'm gonna try experimenting will object name arrays where when you load a room it loops through the array of names you've put in the game instance and if you have them change the room the same way I was doing with individual bools. Same with loading save games. Each item adds a name to an array, and then you take that array of names and save it in your save game blueprint, and when you load a save put that in the game instance and load the game instance data into the game world. It will still be a nightmare to bug test and get working but I'm confident if I keep trying I'll get there. (If you have any advice for save game systems PLEASE LET ME KNOW. DM ME.)\n\nLocalization won't be that bad. Just use Google Translate. I plan to make my game available in English, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, Swedish, Norwegian, Greek, Russian, Macedonian, and Ukrainian. Also marketing your game on TikTok and YouTube Shorts is THE WAY.",

I’ve been working on the opening sequence for about three weeks, trying to nail the pacing.\n\nI have a rule that I don’t give instructions. I just hand them the controller (or keyboard in this case) and zip my lip. If I have to explain it, I failed.\n\nI watched this man walk his character right up to the Equip Weapon terminal. It is flashing. There is a floating arrow bobbing above it. The contrast is high.\n\nHe walked past it. He punched the wall. He jumped on a crate. He tried to fight the first enemy with his bare hands and died immediately.\n\nThen he looked at me and said, \"The combat feels a bit unfair, doesn't it?\"\n\nIt took every ounce of self-control not to scream \"PICK UP THE SWORD.\"\n\nI realized about an hour later, after he left, that the issue wasn't his blindness. It was that my environmental cues were only obvious to me because I’ve been staring at the tileset for 200 hours. To him, the terminal just looked like background scenery.\n\nI had to scrap my minimalist UI this morning and add a prompt. Humbling stuff.\n\nWhat is the most obvious mechanic you’ve watched a tester completely fail to understand?\n\n",

              "text": "TLDR: Don't let your personal gaming preferences pigeonhole your potential audience.  Some people will prefer Controller vs Mouse/Keyboard, or first person vs third person perspective.  And the more UI you have the less of your game world people can see.  Just something to keep in mind during design  \n\\----------  \nWas having a conversation with my wife about the UI I'm designing for my Survival game.  I was taking loose inspiration from other RPGs and survival games with a configurable slot bar at the bottom, and she went on a rant about \"You fucking PC gamers\".    \n  \nShe's a console gamer and made the annoyingly valid point that those UI styles do not port well to console controls, and the more screen space the UI takes up, the harder it is to spot incoming threats.  So she brought up several games as an example.  Outer Worlds 2, Skyrim, Fallout 4, No Man Sky, and we went through the UIs arguing over points.   \n  \nWe came to the conclusion that configurable slots are FINE, but keep most of the configuration in the menu system, and if you have gathering tools then make those dedicated context-use tools (i.e. if you have an appropriate tool, you can harvest the resource, if not, you get a message about needing to equip one).  There is little need to show all of your equipped tools in slots at the bottom while running around the world.\n\nWhen those slots are handy is in a building system with a whole catalog of building components, having a configurable bar of favorite parts saves time, but that only needs to appear when you're trying to build something.  Not necessary for mob murder or rock farming.",

But any one who has ran playtests knows exactly why games do that.  If you don't make the intent very obvious (at least in the beginning tutorial parts of the game) you'll end up with some frustrated players.\n\nA good approach is to use the level design to lock progress until they do the objective.  In your example, have a breakable wall that can only be cut down with a sword.  Have it right next to the equip terminal.  And have a text overlay telling the player how to equip it.  Then add the same breakable wall in a couple other spots in the first area to make sure they remember (forced repetition might not be as needed in this example, but is more helpful for actions that the player could forget about, like dodging, parrying, healing, etc)",

I don’t care for tutorials unless it’s built in to the gameplay or I can check the tutorial in a menu later. Unskippable or mandatory tutorials or npc dialog really annoys me for some reason. If the game engages me and I want more info to get better at the gameplay I will read tutorials or run the from a menu at that point. A quick pop up is cool and arrows in the ground or painting to crates/interactive items is cool too.",

Great design enables the player to execute the tutorial and leave thinking it was their idea.\n\nFor your instance, I’d likely keep the player from reaching an enemy until he picks up the sword. Make him use the sword to clear something out of the way first (if that’s an in game mechanic). Also you can point players to objects in other ways than flashing lights \n\nFor example, as an LD, I’d construct a subconscious funnel that leads the player from an open space to sword so that his eyes are following the leading lines right too it\n\nGood design takes a lot of time and effort.

I avoid in person demos now and rely instead on sending access online so they can experience it in their own time space and equipment. Yes I know I miss out on a lot.

For values, I always see how it looks in total grayscale. If it's too hard to see, I'll adjust the values to make it easier to notice and sometimes add certain things around it to bring more attention, such as more value contrast around it. Color contrast is usually having a color that stands out against the surroundings but still considers colorblindness either with the hue or value, that way it can still be visible to some extent if someone has a level of color blindness. The shape and size are usually a bit easier though. Make the object a shape that contrasts the shapes of everything else, such as a circle on squares or a bird on a bookshelf.\n\nI'm sure these ideas could be adopted into environmental design in games as well, possibly more so thanks to animation and lighting",

If I can see she’s visible, I know she can attack.\n\nSecondly, it would be good to keep in mind that if you expect maybe YouTubers or streamers will play this game, then they might have an issue with the amount of individual things lying around. The anti-aliasing of their video would be working overtime, making their video quite blurry. I mean, I paused the video on my phone and it’s a bit blurry. \n\nThe game looks cool though",

That would provide more depth separation between it and the environment. \n\nThe second thing  I would try is to ensure that the silhouette of the character is always different from the background. There's several moments now where the black body blends fully with the background. \n\nI would also consider changing the environment shader so that you don't get full black and white, but only grays, leaving the extreme values for characters and things you want to pop. You could play around with the saturation of the red, again with the goal of making the characters visually pop versus the background.",

This is a BIIIG one (and from what we've seen no one ever agrees what makes it soulslike, but for us it's the following!  \n  \n\\- We've made it so that every action you do has a cost, things like jumping, attacking etc all costs stamina, but you also have a secondary resource called heat which you generate by attacking (and spending stamina)\n\n\\- Enemies have patterns and you have to adapt your approach to beat them\n\n\\- We've also included the same ability for the enemies (creating and using heat to do some amazing attacks), so there's no easy fights.\n\nAnd loads more but I don't want to already stretch the wall of text answer you're getting :D",

And for this you will probably need more weapons or alternative gameplay. Like in Remains: Behind the next door is a new horror that can quite successfully resist the tactics of the protagonist. With all due respect, you basically need to do everything better than in this game, because your game has direct competition with it, as does SilkSong. Only SilkSong costs 20 bucks, and Remains is free. And since you probably want to make money from your game, you need to focus on Remains and do everything better than there. Because people will compare and say: why should I play a paid game when I can play the free Remains?\n\nBesides the obvious competitor Hollow Knight, I'm also giving a link to [Remains](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3908900/Remains/).

Remains is a standard platformer shooter, without the speed and movement a present here, and silksong is also entirely different, being based closer to dark souls styled as a platformer.\n\nThis game is nothing like those two, and seems to be closer to katana zero. And even if the game doesn't surpass katana zero (which would be very hard for it to do, but it definitely can with how it's already looking) people like me who've already played katana zero are aching for more games like it and would gladly buy similar games, even if they're not quite as good as the original.",

Low FPS animations rather than bad movement and deliberate stuttering seems like a better implementation.

I tried to force a creative solution, but tbh, the first thing that comes to mind is using the effect as a \\*damage\\* indicator, and not a \\*low health\\* indicator. Because then the player is incentivized to \\*avoid\\* damage, rather than forced to seek out health constantly to relieve the low FPS pain.

I mean to suggest that the moment the player takes damage, they could have a freeze frame, and perhaps a second or two of lingering animation staggering and such, but then to return to normal when not actively taking damage. Then yeah, being in a critically injured state might have the constant random freeze framing and such.",

But it’s not just bullet-time, there’s also something I can’t quite define as “inverse bullet-time.”\n\nThere’s also a kind of nostalgic journey through the graphics, going from high-poly to low-poly and eventually to pixel art.\n\nAs a developer, one thing I love is that people testing it, even knowing it’s a game, aren’t always sure if what’s happening is real or not: the glitches, bugs, and weird effects can make them question what’s happening in the game. Some testers even thought their graphics card was breaking, which can be good or bad depending on perspective.\n\nIt’s kind of a meta-game and at least a curious experience. The average playtime of the prototype is quite high, around 3 hours, and for now it has just a few levels.\n\nI know it still needs a lot of polish because these are novel concepts, which is why I really value feedback from other devs.",

I think this is one of those ideas which is best left in the concept stage; it sounds cool, but in practice is not. \n\nAn idea that follows a similar concept -- have the graphics downgrade instead. This would likely be harder to implement. It would start with your current graphics (at good FPS), then it would downgrade into low poly, then no post-processing, then the enemies and such become 2D sprites, then no lighting then perhaps you lose the z-axis altogether and it plays like Wolftenstein 3D... then basic coloured \"placeholder\" shapes, then your dead.",

          "text": "I really like the idea. Despite the naysayers, the gameplay seen here didn’t seem painful at all (though it might feel different when playing). To me the real appeal is the change is pace. The game pitentially feeling easier, more strategic, but also a different kind of stressful when it’s crawling (you’re one frame rate drop away from crashing), vs feeling smooth, action packed, and hectic when it’s flying. I’m curious how you manage the difficulty/gameplay style change of your frame rate changing. Are there times the player is incentivized to drop the frame rate? Does high frame rate allow you to react/dodge things better? Can super high frame rate clip through walls? \n\nThe recent doom games put a lot of thought into incentivizing the player to choose a style that is more fun (health being based on close up kills and hectic action rather than trying to hang back and snipe). How do you avoid players trying to optimize the fun out of your game, and get them to embrace and play with the mechanic rather than fear/avoid/abuse it?",

              "text": "Thank you very much for the feedback. Those are really good questions, and I’ll try to answer them as clearly as possible.\n\nAt first, the game feels like it’s about surviving without crashing, and most testers play it that way initially. But as you pointed out, the idea is for players to eventually use FPS to their advantage. In the game, when you shoot, your FPS temporarily drops, this acts like a kind of bullet-time. Certain weapons reduce FPS more than others, which lets you strategically create slow-motion moments to aim, dodge, or maneuver in rooms with many enemies. Of course, this comes with a risk: at low FPS, each shot increases the system’s temperature, and if you push it too far, the run can crash.\n\nOnce players understand this mechanic, they can start using it intentionally, and that’s when the glitched enemies come into play. These enemies move inversely to FPS: the slower your FPS (activating bullet-time), the faster they move. Using scripts, essentially player abilities, you have to strategically accelerate the game, raising FPS, creating a kind of inverse bullet-time where the environment moves faster than the player. This allows you to defeat these enemies while also increasing the weapon fire rate, which can be used strategically.\n\nMy idea for this game is a kind of dynamic bullet-time that works in both directions and is tied to your health, which makes the FPS lore feel perfect. This lore also opens the door to many other interesting situations.",

By which I mean you've shown 20 seconds of gameplay where the player is limited to less than 15 fps the entire time. I would not want to play at that framerate, even if 'simulated'.\n\nIt reminds me of the inverse but just as bad mechanic (generally), where good players get rewarded with better weapons, making them better, which in turn gives them even better weapons. \n\nIts a shame since as others have said, visually it looks really cool, and something I would definitely grab the demo of to check out. I'd be tempted to follow some of the other suggestions made in this thread, and maybe even drop the concept, if not entirely, then make it an infrequent occurrence.\n\nI'm reminded of Nier Automata, where you can be damaged and the screen turns to lower bit depths. It works there as although visually impaired, you can still play, and quickly restore vision. Off hand though I can't remember the mechanic to repair the view, if it was health based, hacking based or just causing damage to enemies - regardless I always felt in control.",

          "text": "I kinda like it, I personally feel like this is cool but there's a balance to include something like this.\n\nStarting with what people dislike, the stuttering recreates FPS too accurately and causes irritation even just to watch. I like it but you want to design for majority not minority.\n\nI'd start with mechanics? Does getting low health effect the difficulty aside from increasing heat leading to failure? I read it adds input lag which is cool but potential a problematic feature as if people can't handle the FPS drop style within the visuals alone, they probably aren't going to tolerate delayed controls.\n\nI like the theory behind the concept from a balance perspective but I don't feel like it gets harder as you get lower, maybe you intended this though? The input lag as mentioned would be harder BUT equally as frustrating. I'd consider alternatives to get a similar result that are maybe more pleasant to deal with. I do think it should cause disadvantages for the player though, it's just the method that concerns me given your feedback from others here.  \nAlso if the game actually slows down that means lower health is going to give the player more processing time which will actually make it easier for them to keep going in their damaged state, the only restriction for difficulty sounds like it would be the fact that they're on a timer before they overheat which will force action(But forcing action in exchange for slowed time is a fair trade off typically, not a disadvantage).  \nMy Concern with all this is that it's supposed to (or reads like it's supposed to) be a negative effect but sounds like it will make the game easier for players, which will extend the amount of time they have to spend in this state.\n\nI like the idea your playing into but Fun>Frustration/difficulty and even unique mechanics to some degree are going to be super hard to balance. I'd consider how to keep your idea in tact while playing into the same ideas in different ways.  \nLike instead of a delay on controls which would feel horrible you could use the fact that in low FPS environments audio and video will de sync. Maybe some enemies when your in this state will shoot, and give an audio queue, but no visual queue or vise versa. (Coding it to specific enemy types will make it pattern based and will translate to it playing more \"fairly\" as a game. Translate the \"bugs\" like low framerate to fixed patterns that players can solve and the game will flow better.)  \nIt could still frustrate players, but I feel like since it's not a modifier over the whole gameplay loop it will read more like the player has to learn the enemies attack patterns/queues based of the players current heat/health gamestate. If it reads like a pattern and it's a bit BS it can be learned quick and overcome regardless of frustration. If it's a modifier to the gamestate then players are going to constantly dread being low health. Dreading low health is fine, but the reason they're dreading it is going to be because they have to fight controls/frustration. I feel like that will be problematic more so than fun.\n\nJust one small idea that plays into the overall theme you seem to be going for. I do really like your ideas, I'm just spitballing alternatives for things that could frustrate players more than it pulls them in.  \nIt should feel like a mechanic that can be recreated in your game(Hence why I say pattern based), the consistency will make it feel less buggy even if your using the overheating system as a difficulty modifier. I do feel like this idea can be pulled off by \"setting standards\" within the mechanics but I would also predict this game is destined to be more niche because of these mechanics. (Niche isn't bad, it just means it's harder to reach your demographic. Someone trying to Market the game would hate this, but you're also not competing with anyone else directly. Your idea is incredibly unique.)",

              "text": "Thanks a lot for the detailed feedback and for sharing your ideas. They are genuinely very helpful.\n\nMy intention with low health and low FPS is actually the opposite of making things harder. When the player has less health, meaning lower FPS, the whole game slows down to give them a chance to recover from critical situations. As you mentioned, this effectively makes things a bit easier when the player is low, and that is intentional. The goal is to help players survive tense moments rather than punish them further.\n\nI completely agree that the rules need to be clear and that there should be recognizable patterns, so the player can understand what is happening and prepare or adapt their strategy accordingly.\n\nThis also opens the door for players to intentionally lower their health temporarily to reduce FPS and gain more precision in certain situations, such as aiming more carefully when things get hectic.\n\nI had a similar desynchronization idea as well. In my case, I am planning not to apply it globally, but instead reserve it for specific rooms or scenarios themed around internet lag. The classic bad connection feeling where the player, enemies, and projectiles move forward and then snap back to positions from a few seconds ago.\n\nAs you said, in the end all of these ideas will require a lot of playtesting with many players to understand what feels good, what feels frustrating, and where the balance really lands.\n\nThanks again for taking the time to write such thoughtful feedback. I really appreciate it.",

Personally, I’d suggest choosing based on your long-term goals rather than just the current project.\n\nFor example:\n\n* Planning to work on a large project over several years? Unity might be a safer choice. It has a larger ecosystem, more third-party tools, and long-term production support.\n* Need maximum performance and optimization out of the box? Unity still has the edge here, especially for mobile, thanks to its mature tooling and profiling support.\n* Don’t want to deal with licensing or revenue fees if the game monetizes? Godot is a great option. It’s completely free and open source.\n* Comfortable going more “hands-on” and technical with the engine? Godot can feel very flexible and lightweight. In some ways, its current workflow reminds me of Unity’s old Built-in pipeline, which some developers still prefer (like me).",

There was an article in a German gaming website that brought over 1000 wishlists over a week.  \nI think about half of the wishlists are probably from advertising (in Reddit, Youtube and Meta ads), and the rest from those articles/videos and steam visibility.\n\nThis is the latest trailer I have been using: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aa5SAbrrF0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aa5SAbrrF0)",

Thank you for wishlisting!!\n\nYes, here you have resources and you can produce units and also build new factories and defenses.\n\nI just added the option to procedurally generate rectangular maps too [last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastGeneral/comments/1prh2bz/now_maps_can_be_long_rectangles_too_10km_x_40km/), so they can be 10km x 40km for example. The maximum area of 400km2 is because of gameplay reasons, Unity floating point precision and performance.   \nAfter +/- 10km you lose milimeter precision in Unity so things start looking a bit choppier than I would like, but it's not that noticeable. Performance on such huge maps is a bigger issue, and the gameplay becomes extremely long and slow (which is really cool, but probably not for everyone). Imagine sending your troops from one side of the map to another and they take 30 minutes to drive there, it's pretty crazy.\n\nPlanes in the game come from off-map allies or mainland for nations that have a mainland outside of the TLG archipelago so the size of the island doesn't affect them that much, they just come flying, shoot at something and flee.",

Why is he blue while everyone else is grey ? Does that mean that by running away, he's regaining his character and does not conform anymore ? If that's the case, then it's very grim, because he's about to get caught and put back in his place. \n\nSo I've been rambling a bit but that guy should be grey.

The whole joy of the game is management of tentacles to team members and how that team grows. \n\nYou gotta show off that part of the game. That's what I enjoyed the most. It's not about \"the escape\" of the tentacles but the \"embracement\" of them - as aptly sinister as it sounds as a former corporate drone. \n\nAlso potentially show different team attributes on the screens to the attached \"tentacled\" team members. \n\nGood luck!",

The headline writing is the same colour so that's what drew my attention to it. Then I read the title again, looked closer at the image and saw the guy running away and thought \"haha this looks like a funny game.\" It looks like you play as the octopus trying to help run a company and your tentacles are maybe a part of the gameplay loop. Gotta keep the workers working and happy and compliant with company policy and all that.\n\nI like it :D\n\nEdit: Having just looked at the trailer, it looks like a light-hearted fun game. Made me wonder about the lore of the world, if that's even a thing. Is the city ruled by an overlord hive-mind \"boss\" and the octopus is like the infiltrator invisible middle-management character that's there to make things run smoothly. Maybe you have to complete certain objectives or the big boss hive-mind gets mad? Idk. Good luck!",

Love the Steam video, too. The only thing I'd ask for is to, if possible, include some light roleplaying elements with employees and upper management. One of the core components of management in the middle is that you're often required to be two-faced by necessity. With the employees you're advocating for the wants and needs of upper management while trying not to alienate yourself too much. And with upper management you're advocating for the wants and needs of the employees without seeming like you're one of them (workers), because you definitely want upper management to see you as one of them (management) if you hope to progress in your career.\n\nLooks great!

They saw the numbers Lethal Company and Content Warning were doing and decided that social virality is a requirement for their portfolio now.\n\nThey literally said, \"Can’t you just let a second player spawn in? We don't need dedicated servers yet, just P2P.\"\n\nI had to explain, politely, that a deterministic simulation built entirely for single-player logic doesn't just accept a second input stream without rewriting the entire core loop and netcode from scratch.\n\nThey passed on the project. Honestly, it's probably for the best, but the trend-chasing is getting exhausting.\n\nHow do you guys handle it when non-technical partners think Multiplayer is just a feature you toggle in the engine settings?\n\n",

Spoiler alert, they all skipped that part.\n\n>the trend-chasing is getting exhausting\n\nThat's the reality we live in: MVPs with massive traction aka. sure bets (even made a short clip of Gollum saying those two words, lol, because it's soo frustrating to hear over and over). They say you should only reach out to those publishers who are most compatible, but what if there isn't any because all they want is a copy of an already existing game? (so your and their taste will never match)\n\n*And gamers tout that the renaissance of indie gaming is coming. From where though?*\n\nWhile you dodged a bullet, the market isn't better higher up either (at larger publishers); in fact worse, 'cos you'll be lucky to talk to one in person.",

      "text": "So if you haven’t seen it already, Jonas Tyroller made a chrome extension that lets you guess the number of reviews on a random steam game.\n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=kwjrVen-_Aw\n\nWhat’s interesting is that after doing over a hundred rounds personally, I’m finding trends that are _very_ consistent. And I’m able to do this from looking at nothing else except the steam pages alone, and completely ignoring any “marketing” games could have had otherwise. This kind of reinforces a lot of what others say: It’s the quality and the genre of your game/steam page that matters most. After doing this so much, I have a mental checklist that I can run through in about 10-15 seconds on any page and be correct 8 out of 10 times. And usually if I am wrong, I’m only wrong by a single range. Rarely do I guess 1k+ reviews and it end up with ~10. (More often surprise hits throw me off than surprise failures).\n\n\nHere’s the checklist I run, and how that affects my guess:\n\n* Your capsule art matters, but only up to 100 reviews. If it’s just ass it’s a <100 reviews every single time, but a great capsule itself won’t get you above that.\n\n* Genre matters a lot. And Chris zukowski is completely correct on the “crafty buildy simulationy” genre significantly outperforming. If you can make a base, your game just is going to do better. Horror also does well here, but not quite as well. Almost every single 2D platformer undersells. Almost all of them. Don’t make a 2D platformer if you want it to sell. Games that give a “deep mechanics” vibe do much better. Adding Rouge-like mechanics trend to improve scores too.\n\n* 3D games tend to do better in general than 2D. So just being 3D is a plus in general\n\n* Adding online co-op multiplayer will almost always increase your sales range into the next bucket. But it has to be ONLINE CO-OP WITH YOUR FRIENDS. Multiplayer games that require other random players significantly underperform. And this makes sense, as coop games that only require your friends and no one else doesn’t have the “dead game” effect that a competitive multiplayer with empty lobbies would. That, and coop games just inherently have better word of mouth when people make their friends buy it to play with them. Local only coop underperforms. \n\n* You need to have gameplay gifs in your description. Not having them will lower your score.\n\n* Trailers are important. Leading with action and adding SOUND EFFECTS matters a lot. You’d be surprised how many game trailers I’ve seen with just music and no in game sound effects. It’s an immediate red flag.\n\n\n* Releasing your game in 2020 moves you to a higher bucket almost every time (not helpful for today’s market but a funny trend I saw).\n\n* localization matters, but only as a multiplier. Great localization of a 10 review game is a 20 review game.\n\n* Screenshots need to be varied, in both color and what it’s showing (UI, dialog boxes, skill trees, inventory, etc). Doing this is a plus, everything looking samey is a minus.\n\n* Look at the price. This is hard to quantify, as cheaper games tend to be worse quality, but overcharging will drop the score. Free games are a crapshoot and I tend to get them wrong the most.\n\n* finally, don’t get bad reviews on launch. The few times I over guess, I go back to look at the reviews and they’ll be below 65% positive. Usually it’s because of game breaking bugs or some other major problem at launch.\n\n\nSo, with all that said here’s my 15 second strategy to review guessing:\n\n* look at the capsule. If it’s bad just click the lowest score \n\n* watch the first 5 seconds of the trailer, then skip forward if action is good to see _how good_. Listen for in game sound effects\n\n* get a vibe check on the genre and art quality\n\n* see if it has online co-op \n\n* look for gifs in the description\n\n* look for variety in the screenshots \n\n* skim tags and languages.\n\n* finally look at price and release date and adjust accordingly.\n\n\nThis strategy works surprisingly well, and I’m glad Jonas made that plugin. It’s going to help my design decisions a lot going forward",

This does not spark joy\n\nScreenshots: Mid to ok. See above\n\nGenre: Excellent. Rougelike autobattlers do well, and you seem to have good depth in it.\n\nMultiplayer: None but your game can’t have it so w/e\n\nGIFs: you have them but they aren’t exciting IMO. Why not add more intense battles? You first gif is literally just a single guy walk to the right, reseting to the center and then walking up.

Specifically, the text feels off and the laser doesn’t feel like it’s actually impacting the bug. Maybe make the bug look in pain?

I wonder if you’ve noticed quality of the games description being related to review count. \n\nThat is my hypothesis is that even without any of the other info I bet your success rate wouldn’t be too far off reading just the description.\n\nBesides typos and poor writing, the least good games always seem to try *so hard* to sell you on playing them. The best games give kind of a just a confidently low effort description. ",

This accounts for the lions share of releases.\n\n\nMonster catching games tend to have higher production quality and the reviews to back it up in the 1k range. Most high quality 2d games fall in this range for this genre but monster catching has an outsized presence. \n\n\nHigher budget games tend to do well and have either 3d anime graphics or are expedition 33.\n\n\nAction jrpgs are usually 3d and do middling, quality being highly variable. Most are in the sub 1k range. \n\n\nI will optimistically think this means I have a chance to stand out.",

It is reassuring to know that investing in good art done by professionals is a good practice, this is what I am doing too for the main character and animations and I will be doing the backgrounds and such for the levels where I can.",

Your 1-10 downloads a day is nothing - people do try new games all the time, as those games are free.\n\nNow, AI does not need your game's binary at all. There is no way to train the AI on that.

It's hard to tell exactly, but this does reek of some AI learning shit.\n\n  \nEdit: Or maybe not, a mod on the itch subreddit mentions bots boosting download-numbers and this being their hiding strategy. That actually makes sense too and i recall this has happened before;\n\n\"Not a bug exactly. Sometimes we get people try to bot download counts, and they'll hit other pages to attempt to hide their activity. It's generally safe to ignore and they'll get blocked soon enough.\"",

This along with the story I think are the sources of the game's success, but copycats tend to go the opposite direction of adding more stuff.\n\nA successful copy of CO would strip away the game even further while focusing more on a cool narrative.\n\nIf there are copies of it, I don't think they'll actually get it.

They will face backlash on social media without noticeable impact on their sales, which will prompt AI developers to become more common.\n\n\\- Indie devs will use \"no AI\" marketing strategies, with an emphasis on traditional art techniques. They will get a lot of praise for it, with a few of them getting actual financial success thanks to luck and an original and talented art direction. However, AI will creep into most development environments through less obvious means such as code assistance, AI-enhanced procedural level generation, etc.\n\nIndie devs will have to choose between the easy low-budget route (with public backlash) and the hard, uncertain route.\n\nWell-intentioned companies and solo devs will commission artists whom they trust, but who will use AI in their back. More controversies, more backlash, money and time will be lost.\n\nThe most major technical breakthrough will (I hope) be a VR live sandbox world generator, which will be ignored by most of the public because of VR set prices.\n\nGodot, Unity, Unreal and other engines will integrate coding agents/assistants.\n\nEveryone will get the uneasy feeling that it's an 'adapt or fail' situation.\n\nI'll keep programming for the love of the game tho.\n\nOh and my hand-drawn AI-free 2D platformer, Hachichi will release.",

I still hand-write all my dialogue and story beats though - AI sucks at emotional nuance and player choice consequences. But for placeholder assets, quick video transitions, background music? Yeah i'm using every shortcut i can find. Props to you for sticking to your principles though, that article was a good read.",

Bam! Done. That's my placeholder for a dirt texture.\n\nWhen I need a placeholder for an enemy sprite, I open up my sprite editor program and quickly doodle a mean looking face. It doesn't take 2 minutes. That's a placeholder.\n\nWhat's going on is people are experimenting with AI generated assets, to test how potential customers will react to them or to evaluate their quality, to see if they are viable in the final product. Later, people feel like the assets aren't good enough, or customers find out and get pissed.\n\nThen, devs replace those AI assets and say \"don't worry guys, we never intended to release with those assets. Those were just placeholders, chill out\".\n\nIt's kinda shady, imo.",

The way the sand feels like it’s actually sitting on top of the stone, with no obvious tiling etc. I was curious whether you achieved that with a height-based blend (rather than a simple splat mask), maybe combined with world-aligned/triplanar mapping or macro noise for breakup? It looks fantastic and I’d love to learn more about the approach if you’re happy to share. Thank you!",

All their marketing efforts are basically completely and utterly useless, whereas their development efforts lead to amazing video games.\n\nI'm not saying people shouldn't market their games, you're totally right in saying that if you can, you should. But this is all about output.\n\nWhen actively developing games, these people have great output. They love to make games, and it results in amazing project, full of creativity. \n\nWhen marketing games, these people have terrible output, often close to zero success. It drains the life force straight out of their blood and limits the time and creativity they can put into their project.\n\nThat's why I'd say just focus on whatever maximizes your output.

As for the cinematic part, the worldbuilding and story do look compelling, but also... don't really get anywhere? Like, I get that you don't want to spoil anything, but the trailer doesn't even give me a *question* that makes me want to play the game to find the answer, you know? It LOOKS like it's building up to something with the narrator dying and looking for a mystery, but then the big climatic line is a boring \"I have to find a way... to get there\", which *continues* to tell me nothing instead of giving me ANY insight into the game and story and character motivations and the world.\n\nalso re: \"no one else is finding us or reaching out\" YOU gotta reach out to people now, keep the ball going.",

I don't even trust Cyan to make Myst-likes anymore, after Firmament turned out the way it did.\n\nThese things live and die on how good their puzzles are -- if the puzzles suck, you just have a walking simulator with annoying interruptions. Problem is, you can't actually communicate the quality of a Myst-like's puzzles from the trailer, so not wishlisting until reviews are out is probably most people's strategy. \n\nIf you had a hook that made me think it might be worth playing regardless of the puzzles, that'd be something different... but I'm not seeing that here. It looks nice, and doesn't look *not* interesting, but it's also not \"This is the next Outer Wilds/Obra Dinn/etc.\" -- that's the bar I'd be looking for to wishlist a Myst-like nowadays. \n\nLet me restate that: that's the bar for wishlisting, not for buying. If the puzzles are good, people (meaning I) will buy it.\n\nAlso, your game's name sounds like an anime (or, more likely, an anime-adjacent multimedia project), which probably isn't helping anything. You wouldn't know that if you aren't a part of that space, but both \"Project\" and \"Re\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" are common in that sector, so you're probably losing people with that alone.\n\nIs there a way to fix any of the above? Eh... a subtitle might help the name? \n\nOtherwise just keep letting people see it in the right subs, and word-of-mouth will do the work when it comes out.

Just one of those annoying blind spots that only become apparent far too late to change it. \n\nI feel like that's close to being a good subtitle, but it should probably evoke \"memory\" more directly. Or \"death\". Or both. \n\nI'm drawn to the word \"Terminal\", since it means both a machine interface and \"an end\"? \n\nGlancing at your store page, that handheld laser -- put whatever that is front and center in the trailer. I don't care if it's a one-off to that location; it's the most immediately distinct puzzle out of everything you've shown, since it seems to be interacting with the world. It says \"this isn't *just* key and switch puzzles\". (Not that \"just key and switch puzzles\" is bad; it's just expected for the genre)\n\nAs for the story... I think the character matters more than the story, since the story is his life, no? Is he a constant presence in the game (narrator or such)? He's already got good characterization from this trailer, but I could use some more direct, human interaction. Does he show up at different ages? It'd be interesting to play with his younger and older self in the trailer. Or, since he's a scientist, have him give a lecture? Lots of options there.\n\nOr is the mystery the part you're trying to sell? A hint as to what \"THAT day\" was would be pretty good. Even if it's just the narrator asking a question about it that teases it (e.g. \"Where did she go?\" \"What did we see?\", though hopefully something slightly less generic).\n\nRegardless, I think you don't have to stress *too* much. Quern managed to find that audience, despite having *that* name and looking way more derivative of Riven. And its trailers are basically the same as yours, in terms of structure. \n\nOf course, if you can figure out a way to hook people who don't play Myst-likes... well, that'd be even better. But I'm not sure I could do that with a team and a AAA budget for market research -- probably best to stick to the target audience.",

Big streamers are either very busy or ask for a lot of money.\n\nSteam advertisements will get your wishlists up pretty well. Our game was in AdventureX this year and a publisher that sponsored the event organized a steam streaming campaign that gave our wishlists a small boost.\n\nI think what most people won't tell you is that there's just a lot of luck involved in marketing. You can increase your odds with consistent, creative, unique marketing or by having great art, or gameplay, music, etc, but none of those elements ensure success.

By the time it actually got to the gameplay, I was already checked out because you gave me material that I have no context or care for and that does nothing to spark interest.\n\nYou need to prove that your game is actually fun to play first, then give the viewer something to chew on story wise to show that your game can KEEP their interest after the novelty of the mechanics has worn off.\n\nI have no idea if your game is good or not based on the trailer, but I do know I have no desire to play it based on what was shown.\n\nAll that being said, it looks extremely polished and like a lot of thought and care went into it.

It reminds me of your experience and makes me question the quality of the wishlists we gained in the summer on the day of gamescom. \n\nMore generally, I would say that three years of work without financial security and, above all, without any guarantees is madness. I imagine that these are things you can afford to do, but as things stand, I would say that you shouldn't spend so much time without measuring the viability your game.\n\nFar be it from me to discourage you. Others say that 2.5K wishlists is already something and they are right, the project looks cool, and if you're working on it, it's because you like it.

If you remake it, keep most of it and make clips where you are zoomed into the machines/puzzles, that's 1 thing Cyan did different is hard focus on the machines for about 20 seconds later in the video. Also you have to keep in mind that Myst players already know what Cyan makes and they assume any game Cyan makes is like Myst. You don't have that so there will be much more explaining.\n\nAlso a lot of people nowadays will think it's too hard so try to show how it's easy, probably in the steam description",

I think the main part I have tried to keep intact for that intentional discomfort is the manual nature of everything, having to enter the inventory to use keys and equip weapons, that sort of thing. By its nature most of this will have to be fine tuned when playtesting starts. (In this tangent I forgot this was probably mostly targeted around the physics, honestly it's been quite hard to make it feel nice to interact with but making the amount an object gets pushed by the player quite exaggerated got rid of most tedium, I still need to work on making the objects interaction with the players actual body feel nicer. Currently I find it really works in creating tension when you need to break some crates or something in the way with harder enemies close by that you'd rather avoid entirely)",

That kind of friction feels meaningful when it’s consistent.\nOne thing I’ve found useful is thinking of discomfort as something the system regulates rather than something you tune once. When it’s bounded and predictable, players start reading it as tension instead of clunk.\nCurious if you’ve noticed players adapting their behavior over time — not getting more “comfortable,” but becoming more deliberate because they’ve learned the cost of each action.",

I really hope your theory isn’t correct, because that would mean this growth might fade soon 😛... but it does sound reasonable.\n\nThe only thing that makes me wonder is how the Winter Sale would be boosting us when we don’t have a demo yet or even a release date set. Then again, maybe because of the significant number of wishlists, Steam already treats us as a product that gets included in these kinds of events… hmm, an interesting theory... and possibly a true one.",

I’ve worked in marketing for many years, and I’ve honestly never seen such a positive community as the one around IRON NEST.\n\nSo if I can give one piece of advice… start talking about your game as soon as possible.

It’s absolutely not in the sense that I think I’m so great, more in the sense that I don’t really know who this game is for, since it’s currently promoted as a speedrun game but it’s actually about puzzles. I think this might not necessarily work well together.\n\nThe art style that I liked so much doesn’t work at all with a speedrun puzzle game, because you don’t have any color coding that would help you make decisions faster. I’m writing all this to describe the path the game took with me from the first time I saw it to my final decision not to launch it after all. At the beginning I felt like the target player, and I’m writing this post because it’s a shame for me to bounce off a project that won me over at first sight.",
