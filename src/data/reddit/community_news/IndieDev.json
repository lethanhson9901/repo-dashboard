Then you got the more experienced and more established artists who will charge you maybe up to $1000 and more depending complexity especially and then you got industry professionals that also work with and for serious studios and who have a prestige, name and experience and skills that will charge you easily up to several thousands of dollars for a capsule art but those bring more to the table than people think. Its more than just about polished looking capsule/key art and something lower tier of artists simply lack.\n\nProfessional artist here.",

                  "text": "I'd like to add on to this that a good clause for a commercial use contract like capsule art etc, is to make the up front flat fee a non-refundable advance on royalties, and include in the agreement a royalties fee which caps out at a higher flat amount. Say 3 to 5 times the initial amount given up front. This helps keep the startup cost lower while not taking advantage of the artist unfairly in the case where their art helps a product go viral for serious sales numbers. \n\nExample math: artist is paid $300 for a piece of marketing art such as Steam capsule art. The contract specifies this as an advance, non-refundable, on a 1% royalty on gross of all sales past the first 1000 copies. The royalty fee is scheduled to cap out at $1500 total, 5x the advance. The game is sold at a price where the developer gets $6. Therefore, until the game sells 6000 copies, the artist isn't owed anything more. Many games will never reach this benchmark and the contract becomes effectively a flat fee. If the game sells 26,000 copies, the cap will be reached, so even if it goes on to sell a million copies, the artist's financial interest in it is terminated past that point.\n\nFor the developer, $1500 from the sales gross of $156,000 is well worth paying for a key presentation piece without which those sales likely wouldn't happen. For the artist, getting the extra payday when the game releases and does well prevents resentment at not benefiting from that performance in proportion to their contribution. If the game sells really exceptionally well even beyond that, well, probably the developer should hire the same artist again for future projects, and pay more up front this time.",

The knight looks generic, but I'm stuck handling kid stuff right now so I can't go look at the game's page to get a feel for options that could have been explored.\n- Old one has an interesting charm to the eye element, but the rest is not visually legible. There is something there, but it's not workable.\n- Artist should have worked with you and let you approve a mockup, design concept, approval draft, or similar. I'd be pissed at being left in the dark then presented with a \"final\" without approval. But if the artists did keep you in the loop and you did approve delivery, then it is what it is.\n\nThere are some tricks with exposing eyes and human faces that'll capture people's attention better, as it's basically hardwired into every animal's brain to look for eyes and spend some processing power to identify what happens next. That's the charm in the first one that I think other people are getting too. But I can't say which one is better without more research because the most important thing with key art is to set up the promise your game intends to deliver on.",

When you start seeing pixels of irregular shape, meaning some squares are larger than others, and lines that are not quite uniform, then that is a hallmark sign of being AI generated, or someone just tried to slap a \"pixel effect\" on an image.  \n  \nEdit: meant to say 'Pixel art resolution (like 32×32, 64×64, 320×240)'. \n  \nAnother way to articulate it is: In true pixel art, all pixels align to a consistent grid, and artists make deliberate, manual decisions at the individual pixel level. If you see inconsistent pixel sizing, blurred edges, or grid misalignment, it’s often a sign that the image was either AI-generated or created by applying a pixelation filter rather than being hand-crafted pixel art.",

          "text": "I guess take this with a grain of salt given all the feedback haha, but for what’s its worth, I can appreciate the redesign and could see how the price was fair for the work.\n\nThe typography on the new design is nice and the coloring and the iconography does a good job of both conveying the knight theme and the incremental aspect in a way your original didn’t. You’re essentially buying a logo redesign and character art and background which feels like it would reasonably cost a certain amount to cover an artist’s time.\n\nThat being said, I do understand the concerns too, I think my first instinct was also wondering whether it was a great deal. A few things people have mentioned - the new character is a bit generic, the pose is a bit stiff, I personally think some stronger lighting or maybe some particles could make the scene composition look more interesting. The character is also smaller in the new design, which means that it’s harder to appreciate when tiny. \n\nI was wondering if potentially the layout of your post made this scale effect even more pronounced, as seeing all the time and cost spelled out leaves even less room for the artwork to shine haha. I do think if I zoom in I like the new design better. \n\nOf course, capsule art needs to be read at a small scale in general, but if the artist is delivering something that took time and craft and detail to produce but wasn’t exactly what you needed, maybe that’s something more indicative of needing closer portfolio review or instruction than being a rip off necessarily.\n\nAnyway all that just to say I think it wasn’t a total loss to commission the logo redesign and wishing you all the best with the game! :)",

Could maybe be a little faster and cheaper but for a custom waist/up illustration + background combined with a stylized logo, that is about the price range I’d expect although I would definitely be wanting the files, as they are yours. People in the comments here are overreacting tbh, I’ve done logo design for 10ish years and while I rarely ever have a reason to charge over 100, if someone asked me for a custom illustration to go along with the logo then it would definitely float around 250ish but that’s also under the assumption that I’m giving them all art files to use how they want, background, character, etc. I think it looks fine, but if you want changes just ask for them, the artist likely factored revisions into the price and if not, then they are charging too much.",

I like the graphics, the steam screenshots looked varied and interesting and the trailer was decent. Which caused me to click download, I play a lot of demos on the weekends though so I click open all kinds of new games no matter the capsule. I think this game is def a gem so it would be well worth putting some investment into a good capsule artist if you can afford it. Great work, and best of luck! :)",

I'm not saying it's outstanding, or unique, but it should work well enough that I would just take this as a lesson in getting pricing quotes and confirming the artist's vision is in line with yours. \n\nWhile most games (and products in general) are made/broken by the first image in the advertisement, they also exist in the context of people in the market for similar products. If this was some combination of pixel-art side-scrolling RPG rogue-lite then the generic art style would probably make people wary of the product and question why they should buy it over the other dozen beside it, but for idlers it just needs to look professional enough to stand marginally above the sea of free titles you're competing with for attention. Take this with a mountain of salt, but there is a chance that a decent colour palette and composition will go further in this genre than a soulful style and consistent details/proportions - although, of course, anyone would usually prefer all of the above. Shit, the outlining/drop-shadowing of the title is probably more important to catching eyes than the design of the knight.\n\nSo, even though people have raised a lot of valid concerns with the piece, I would probably scroll down a Steam search of idlers and imagine your game sitting beside them at whatever price point you're looking at. Do you think it stands out enough to get some traffic? Is the title too small when scaled down to the size it will display as on the Steam search? Is it the most expensive title a dozen games either direction? Do the other visuals on the page stand out enough to convert traffic into purchases? Do they accurately display how your game will be similar/different to other games in the genre? You're advertising an idler game to a bunch of idler fans, not a video game to nondescript video game fans. Would you yourself give the game a chance, as (presumably) a fan of the genre?\n\nPlaying with a few filters myself, I'm seeing a lot of blank or single-detail backgrounds which only show off the title. The ones that aren't often look too busy, as if they're a wall poster and not the thumbnail to a Steam game. Could yours be executed better, both generally as a piece of art and specifically as the advertisement to an idler game? Yeah, in many regards. But, as a random internet commenter, it looks better than plenty of what I'm seeing, including games with some attention. Paid idlers are very hit-or-miss since they compete with so many free titles, but yours still looks more professional than many of the hits.",

The capsule art can be what makes a person even pay attention to your game. I’m not commenting on whether this artist deserves it or not with their drawing, but in general. $300 for a full illustration piece for capsule art is cheap. The internet has just done a great job at devaluing the work it takes. Their are INCREDIBLE artists you could commission for this, but they will charge you more.\n\nJust like with tattoos.. you get what you pay for a lotta the time. I’m not saying you specifically did wrong, $300 isn’t a terrible idea of how much to pay, I’m really just responding to those who think it’s too much in general. And if it is, then learn to draw yourself (I mean it not sarcastically). \n\nAnd to comment on this specific art: I have a hard time seeing AI in pixel art, but to me it looks like it’s made legitimately. If they had done AI there probably would be more to it. Did you like the artist’s other work? I feel hesitate to say this cause I seem to be in the minority here, but if I saw this capsule art I would click on it. I honestly mean that, I promise I’m not saying it just to be contrarian. It gives off a similar vibe to other games I like to play, so I could give it enough attention to click.",

Many jobs like this project in the professional zone pay in the $60/hr area, indie usually less but still, if you had them working for 2 weeks they probably hit 30 hours.  If the relationship is good they WILL get better and faster the more work you do with them.  The industry is filled with stops and starts like these, don't burn relationships over one project, everyone's doing their best.",

The knight theme gets it across albeit kind of bland.  Tho for what you're getting is okay, kind of crazy for commenters to say it's super fucking terrible.  Paying comparingly to like $3.75/hr if they spent 80hrs or $7.5/hr if they did this in 40hrs.\n\nAgree with the rest of the comments tho, you definitely get a better return if you iterated a new capsule yourself. (Especially the composition of your knight/bg is still very visually interesting tho muted in colors so not recognizable first glance) Take reddit opinions with a grain of salt tho cause you're getting the most vocal minority than actual data of people choosing to click on this or not.",

For me i try to update throughout the process at every part especially if the commissioner is paying that much, but even if it was a cheap commission I try to update constantly to make sure everything is to the commissioners liking... it makes me wonder why they didnt do that? I get that every artist has different methods and such but it seems like the bare minimum to at least check in?... and in no way is their art bad! But i do think they should've checked in to at least see if you liked it? Especially for the price.. but again back to their other work, is this similar to their other work they've done or youve seen or is this much more sloppy or what? And what did you originally ask for? Or did you want a legit just pixel version of the reference photo? Sorry i dont mean to pry im just curious lol [again not blaming you for anything and not hating on the artist just wondering what the communication was like lol] \n\n[IN COMING SELF PROMOTION OF MY OWN COMMISSIONS AND ART THAT DOES NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE POST AT HAND READ UPON YOUR OWN WILL]\nbut besides that if do commissions like I said so if anyone in the comments or OP if you guys want a commission i might as well use this comment to somewhat advertise myself lol, but i have multiple examples of my art on my profile as well as more examples i can send through dms, I can do animation as well as art in general, I'm fine with drawing/animating : ocs,ships,furry,nsfw,gore,sfw,backgrounds,dynamic poses,i can also imitate other anime styles,and more[just ask] (i just have alot of mha on my profile because thats my fav anime and alot of people who commission also really likes that anime lol but I ofcourse do more than mha, and all nsfw content on my profile is hidden but if you want examples of past coms ive done let me know through dms)\nI allow commissioners to set the price they think is fair to pay that way I dont overprice or underprice my art🧍\nAnd as far as payment goes i only take payment either upfront or half upfront and half afterwords, and as far as how I take payments I can take it in forms of giftcards[usd],cashapp, or revolut[worldwide currency transfer app so I can take almost any currency]\nI have many references of past people who have commissioned me, and as far as work around time I try to get work done quick and usually start on drawing right after payment is sent unless I have responsibilities to take care of in real life at that moment[school,chores,family] and I have no problem with working within time lines and or picky critiques, I have no problem with redrawing something untill to someones liking and I give constant updates at everyday from rough pose scetch, rough scetch, lineart, and coloring/rendering.\nAs far as rules I have for myself that I'm not willing to budge on is that I will not take payment afterwards, it is either payment upfront or half payment upfront and then the other after\n\nbut if you would like a commission just dm me on here and then we can go from there and I can show more of my work^^\nI also have both a tiktok and an insta were you can see some of my work there than too^^ just ask^^\nAnd alot of commissioners tend to like to continue conversation over to discord and I also have one of those sk if youd like just ask for my tag ir send yours^^",

Not dozens, but a few based on his interpretation of the final work. We're talking composition. Maybe ask you if you want some specific tones or colors too. That's for early. Then, he should have, at least, shown you a more advanced composite of the work. Not final, but something just to know if he's going the right way. Then, if at the end, the result is as shown, then yes you paid for what you got regardless of what's being said by other.\n\nThe worse that people can do is give a \"sketch\", some screenshots, a pile of money and let any artist cooks, unless the artist has been working with you or on the game extensively enough to understand what the game is about visually.\n\nFor example, for a dungeon crawler game with graphics like Terraria, that result is worth the 300$ as long as you get the source file. It's also important to know where the artist is located because the representation of values is different between countries even if it's proposed on the same platform.\n\nFor example, being a graphic designer who has over 23 years of experience in Canada, that 300$ would barely cover 5 hours of my time (and I'm actually on the cheap side, price-wise). I would have taken 1 hours to make sketches for suggesting better composition & colors and fonts styles, 2 hours of actual work and maybe 1 hours in communications involved with the sketches and mid-journey development. Then the remaining hour would be fixes and/or adjustments if necessary.\n\nThe *2 weeks* means absolutely nothing. It's not like the artist worked 8 hours per day for 2 weeks, but more like he had a number of things to work on and it took 2 weeks to work on your and finish it.",

I have no idea what the game is based on the professional art, but seeing your art I've already got some ideas and they all sound fun so I'm more inclined to click on it I think.\n\nJust my two cents. I think use the bottom art if it's in a place where the viewer will be exposed to what your game is anyway, but if you're just trying to get someone to be curious about your game at a glance before moving on, use the top one.",

The first couple of seconds are critical and it feels a bit slow, launch straight into the gameplay and make sure those cuts are sharp. \n\nMake sure to include at least 3/4 gifs of gameplay loops, no one reads these days so bright shiny gifs will help.\n\nI would suggest you try and increase the number of languages. If you can’t try and do a steam page in each different language it will get shown and people do understand if the game is in English even if they can’t understand it. But I would suggest trying to localise it.\n\nMake sure to get bundles with other games, this will be your sales tail. \n\nNaturally reach out to lots of streamers, you normally want to aim for 500-1000 emails, I know it’s a lot but it can really help with those wishlists.\n\nI notice you have controller support, make sure you do steam deck support too.",

Then I started nearing the end of development and realized my game dev Reddit account had to low karma to post anywhere even for advice my marketing skills were fine but not enough and I didn't have the money to make it do more. I ended up spending more time trying to market then working on my game of which I was spending 15 hours a day for months loving every second of development beforehand. That part was so fun the problem solving exciting the seeing an idea slowly forming something I never believed I could do made real was game changing. Then 3 hours of marketing a day was boring and burned me out in a couple of weeks. I need to get back into it from scratch make a few passion projects that show my skill and dedication and just build a small following off of that on like itch io and places like that. Fuck marketing and social media. Also fuck making menus. Coding menus is awful and I'm glad I only had to do it once to have a starting template for life.",

Perhaps a little grass could be present to create depth around the wheels.\n\nHowever what we could observe from this perspective are subtle reflections off the car windows and the surface of the car. Imagine the stuff you’re driving past is invisible to us but is reflected off the car. It doesn’t have to be much and it’ll create a sense of speed and movement to the car that isn’t currently present (at least when watching from my phone).\n\nI’d also increase contrast between the lit parts of the trees/background and the unlit parts. This way we focus more on the car and the speed of things moving towards it. \n\nThe trees closer to the car could also catch more light while the trees further in the background are less affected. Again this increases depth. \n\nAlso none of this lighting makes much sense in the physical world, but if you make it consistent the brain will buy it and like it.\n\nIf I’m making no sense let me know.\n\nEdit:\nWanted to add I like what I see already! Don’t want to just offer advice like there’s something wrong with your work.",

Its feeling very artificial and rigid because your camera is locked dead center on the car so you see the bumps in the road but you dont feel them, and you see it “touch” the ground but you dont hear or see it in any way that makes you go oh shit or ouch! Give the camera some lag when accelerating and lead time to see in front of it like youre a passenger in the car feeling the movement, bouncing on every bump and vibrating down the rocky dirt road ever so slightly. Show the body of the car getting scraped away with sparks and make sure players hear that grating nails on a chalk board, clanking breaking sound you never wanna hear in a car. And the car looks like its a beater so give it a fun engine noise to clank along the path with. ;)",

          "text": "Your proto looks really promising.  You might want to take a look at an early ‘80’s coin op game, Moon Patrol, that IREM did and Williams distributed.  The game play centered on trading your need to get somewhere fast with seeing far enough ahead of you to react to obstacles in your path. \n\nWith respect to making the van pop, I think the windows feel kind of painted on at present. It pulls the van out of the scene. if you made the widows tinted, darker but translucent with a small alpha, you’d see through to a darkened background. That would attach the van more to the environment.  Guess you’d also need a silhouette of a driver, since you can see into and through the van, that could bounce as van goes over bumps, details that may seem small but have an big subliminal impact on believability and a positive  surprise factor when the player realizes the detail on repeated play.\nAny kind of junk loosely strapped to the roof that can bounce around would be fun too.\nThe headlight cone, as an element that illuminates  much of the road ahead on the right side of the screen, can be a key part of game play strategy. Making the headlight cone brighter would make it pop, too, especially if you darken the foreground/under-road region.  in fact, if the areas outside of the headlight beams darkened in a gradient to the edges of the screen, player would feel more like they were driving “too fast”, or outrunning their headlights on a dangerous unfamiliar road.  The concern that something is liable to pop out from the dark could influence your game play as well as adding a level of suspense.\nYou can use forward visibility vs velocity in game play as well as giving the scene a cinematic sense. If the van position to the right of center, were based on the van’s absolute velocity with acceleration adding to/subtracting from the van’s current X-coordinate on the screen.  The van would move closer/farther from frame right, sort of outrunning the camera, as it accelerates but letting the camera catch up as it decelerates.  When braking, the camera would first outrun the van so that the van slid left in frame as you braked, returning to screen center as the brakes are released. The reduction of the amount of viewable road in front of you as you accelerate, and as van velocity climbed, would make the player have to balance speed with desire to see farther ahead down the road.\nTrying to keep the engine from blowing could be another variable in both play and visuals",

      "text": "I made a huge mistake. I transferred an app(game) to a so-called publisher that ended up producing close to 0 results for the project, and then told me I needed to pay \"5-10k\" for them to transfer it back via steamworks.\n\nI worked on a game for more than 3 years when I got an email about a publishing offer.\n\nI had a video call in which the lead guy straight up told me to my face that he didn't think the game had any potential, but that they wanted to publish an unfinished game I had been working on previously. A huge red flag that I just didn't take seriously enough. I had been dealing with an unrelated hardship at the time, and I think it clouded my judgement here. I was desperate for help and just kind of went, \"What's the worst that can happen?\".\n\nSo I agreed to let them publish both games and they proceeded to 'run a marketing campaign'. I never really verified anything because I was overwhelmed dealing with something else (divorce, it was divorce).\n\nI did see wishlists go up, but it wasn't significant, and hard to know who to attribute them to because I was doing my own marketing effort. For all I know, their impact may have been 0.\n\nCommunication was sporadic, and ultimately unreliable. Chaotic, even.\n\nMy correspondent was either quitting, being replaced, or changing position within the company every week or two.\n\nLet me just say that I had launched a game before. Self-published. No real marketing.\n\nIt got about 23 reviews. It was my first game, and so that was a success for me.\n\nSkip forward to the release of this game, with the help of a \"publisher\", and... 4 reviews. Yeah. Yup, 4.\n\nIt's hard for anyone to foresee this, but they advised me to wait for a better release date, and while I waited, an indie game with a very similar name and theme launched. The \"what-ifs\" killed me for a while.\n\nA month went by and I heard nothing. I had to email them several times to get them to honor the first months payment. I was surprised when they actually did.\n\nTo work for more than 3 years on something and then to have to email and wait and wonder and email again and again before finally getting paid your scraps... yeah, I am never transferring an app to a publisher again.\n\nThe main guy assured me that they would send a revenue report at least once a month, then 4 months went by without a word from them. I decided I wouldn't be doing business with them and I wanted my game back. But of course, the guy refused, and said if I wanted it back I would have to buy it back for \"5-10k\".\n\nSo, I had Steam delist the game.\n\nThe name of the \"publisher\" is actually the most generic name possible: \"The Game Publisher\".\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nI am FlipswitchX on Twitch",

Its very important to make sure you really read and analyze a contract, mark notes and things you want removed, and then have meeting to discuss the notes and demand the removal of the clauses you don't want. It sounds like you fell victim to a \"capable sales person\" and it sucks. There's a good chance there's no legal recourse for you, and unless the contract says otherwise there's no legal path for them to pursue you. So the best option might be to grieve your project and move on armed with this knowledge in the future. It can happen to anyone, and there's a reason these publishers target rookies. Don't beat yourself up over it, and try not to be bothered by other people victim shaming you",

          "text": "I'm gonna have to second \"Find Matt's Cats\" for a few reasons. The issues I have with the considered names:  \n*Matt's Hidden Pets* feels like it demonstrates why losing the \"Cats\" is a non-negotiable. People love cats specifically, you love cats specifically, and it rhymes with your name.  \n*Matt's Lost Cats* does have some trifling with the many compound consonants in the middle. \"slostc\" is a lot to say.  \n*Matt's Missing Cats* is a less egregious example of the above, but does feel a bit tiresome to say a second M word immediately after Matt. Both of these options lose the natural break in the middle that \"Matt's Hidden Cats\" gives you.  \n*Matt's Scattered Cats* goes the other way and I see the appeal, but imo saying the same vowel sound 3 times in a row makes abbreviating the name difficult without dropping your name off the front, likely becoming \"Scattered Cats\" out of necessity, which personally I'd rather not.  \n*Matt's Many Cats* has similar double M problems, though does give your tongue more of a break than \"missing\".  \n\n\n\"*Find Matt's Cats*\" does a few things I like:  \n\\- The first word is \"find\", which is both exactly what you'll be doing in the game, and is a word with connotations of serendipity and discovery and surprise, which is a lighter tone than fixating on what's \"lost\" or \"missing\" (I know we're really splitting hairs but what's in a name).  \n\\- The phrase \"Find Matt's Cats\" is also a direct command. The legendary *Where's Waldo?* pulls you in with curiosity by phrasing itself as a question, and I feel this similarly gets your attention by immediately throwing you into the objective and prompting you to do the thing in the title.  \n\\- All the benefits of the simpler \"Matt's Cats\" can be preserved as it will likely become the common abbreviation when spoken, keeping both your name and the quick rhyme, and at the same time keeping the visual/textual value of the word \"Find\" in defining the objective.  \n\\- The need for a softer word in between \"Matt\" and \"Cat\" is eliminated if there's no word in between them at all. Saying two single-syllable words quickly is much easier than throwing another 2-syllable word that uses the opposite side of your phonic anatomy in the middle.\n\nSo that's my vote lol",

I started playing them in middle school when I was around 13 on flash sites and at almost 26 years old I have all the games on steam and still replay at least one game from the series almost yearly. I distinctly remember checking your site every couple of days excitedly watching that progress meter for ebf5, I was so eager to finally play. This series was my childhood and I cant thank you enough for the wonderful memories. Absolutely top tier art style, top tier music and hilariously memorable characters. Finances are tough for me these days so I unfortunately wont be able to buy whatever you title this game (my vote is on matt's many cats!) on launch but I hope I'll be able to pick it up sooner than later! Thank you again for the wonderful games :) here's to another 13 years!",
