While being humble and honest with yourself is good, it puts a bias on people before they've even given it a chance. There's a sliver of people that will check it out to see what you consider a flop, but if the guy hitting release calls it a flop, why should anyone bother. If I were on your team, I'd be disappointed seeing this post. I know you're not trying to minimize anyone's efforts, but as someone who has touched the project for 3 years, you should have good confidence.

But I got paired with a friend that lived around the block, just me and him. We didn't even have a full team. But somehow, we figured out it would be a good idea to present it as a sock puppet show. We spent weeks making the puppets and the stage and rehearsing. It was very clever and in the end, we killed it! But when it came to standing in front the class as a young freshman who strived to fit in...I faltered. As we got up to do our presentation, I said \"now comes the embarrassing part\" out loud. We do our presentation, absolutely nail it, and get some genuine applause from the audience. And then the teacher gave us her feedback. B+, she would have given us an A+ if I hadn't said what I said in the beginning. I was sooo salty about that moment for so long (I'm sorry for the grade, Mike). A full letter grade, just for my comment? But as an adult, I understand now. Don't denigrate your work because you might be embarrassed of how other people will see it. Be proud that you put forth the effort.",

Or some stuff from cult of lamb; both of those seem to be in the same style of SVG-ish artwork.  But their stuff stands out more to me immediately.\n\nHope it goes well!  I wouldn't shy away from updating some things even after release; even should it mean redoing core artwork.  Sometimes it really pays off.",

If you KNOW the interest is low, why not just price it at 9.99 bucks with 20% off?\n\nNow your game fell flat entirely and because of the way the algorithm works it will never ever pick up again. Such a shame for a great looking game that looks to be made with care and love!\n\nIf you accidentally price your game too low, whats the worst that can happen?

XD it's not mind blowing to me after reading the post and these comments, seems pretty in line with the rest of their actions. From the post and comments I've gathered:\n\n● called their own game a flop in their own post about the launch, already setting a precedent for peoples views/opinions of the game\n\n● didn't plug the game in anyway, no pic, link, etc making it incredibly hard for ppl to check out\n\n● chose a generic title for their game making it even harder to find and check out\n\n● didn't announce the games release on the games/company's social media (someone had to repost an old post to bring attention to it)\n\n● didn't listen to constructive feedback about game elements being hard to understand visually (someone mentioned that they told them a while ago the fire elements or something were hard to understand and that they still weren't changed in release)\n\n● and now you mentioning the price being way too high for this kinda quality and level of game/interest etc.\n\nIt's like they did everything possible in the book to make sure their game failed. Everything is screaming sheer incompitence. Atp it doesn't matter if the games good or not, no ones gonna play it and find out. Whoever is managing things over there did a terrible job, and I would be really annoyed if I worked on this game.",

That would look amazing with the systems you're showing here.\n\nMist and fog regions would be great too\n\nIf you include dark and desaturated (evil) textures for making desolate or horror islands that could broaden your appeal. I know it's the opposite feel of what you have going on here but the contrast would be visually arresting.  If i could make a ying yang island of light and dark would be cool as hell.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oytu7cfjxqgg1.jpeg?width=3005&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe2f5a27f6230defd1244c7e632df59d57b958be",

          "text": "This looks really awesome! Love the artistic style and the water looks especially rad!   \n  \nOne thing I'd expect to see is the ability to place down randomized clusters of foliage. So like, instead of just a single bush or tree, there is an area of effect circle that can paint a bunch of stuff down at once, so to speak. Speed up the process of placing things down, but then having the ability to delete and move individual objects. \n\nAnd then as others have said, having a way to plant specific trees or shrubs that could then attract certain types of animals would be really cool. It could even be almost like a tech-tree, where you plant a certain type of berry, which brings small birds and deer to the island, or you plant trees close to the water, giving places for sea life to create homes in which attracts cranes or dolphins. \n\nthis last idea would be a lot and probably beyond the scope, but something I've always wanted to see in a game like this is the ability to speed up time by x10000, so you can watch the world change from erosion and weather and see a simulation of what your island would look like 1,000,000 years into the future in 100 seconds. You'd probably be doing PhD levels of research in order to implement a simulation on that scale but would be really cool. \n\nAll in all, keep up the awesome work! Looking forward to seeing future posts about this! :D",

Climate zones and seasonal changes would act as the underlying framework, influencing what could appear, evolve, or be generated in each area of the world.\n\nEven though I didn’t finish that project, the conceptual model still feels solid to me, and I can clearly see how it could integrate naturally with systems like this one.",

It would be cool to have rock slides be a thing, so you have some changes when manipulating the terrain and have to follow basic physics.\n\nThen I'm make the grass and trees grow up automatically around the water, and die off if it dries up. Add animals that pop up around trees that are sustained.\n\nThen I'd turn it into a colony sim where you had to meet the needs of the inhabitants on the island, but thats just me. You seem to be taking a different approach.",

I mostly don't care when a game says it's unsupported as that means very little. I care quite a lot when a game says it's verified.\n\nOne thing that I always look for is whether or not the game claims to support controller. I've tried playing games that don't and 99% of the time it doesn't end well (and steam even considers these to be playable, which is absurd imo)",

It's also about what it indicates about the developer's future support to leave a game as \"unsupported\" vs a dev that tries to get it to supported.

When I want to game, I want to game. I don't want to read about people's strategies getting some game working.\n\nIt's like how after years of trying every version of Windows, the BSDs, various Linux distros... all of the major desktop environments and window managers... different package managers, etc... That these days I'm too busy to deal with what were once minor things about getting a new environment working and am happy to stay on a boring \"it just works\" platform for the long haul... Similarly, at this point, I just want things to work. When I look at games I just want to pick one and play, I don't want to waste ANY of my limited time researching what games might secretly work or how to get them working. It's just completely unnecessary when so many games work so well. I already have more games than I could play, why would I waste more time not playing games?",

A lot of games fail compatibility for silly reasons like small text or showing keyboard binds in tutorials.

If the game really starts struggeling so hard in the late game, its not a joy anymore especially if you only play it on steam deck. \n\nYou wouldnt want to buy a AAA game for console as well and then see that the game gets in to unplayable states once you reached the last third of the game.\n\nWith Steam Deck you have to consider it like the game you request needs to have a console like polished experience to be justified to be verified.

This means that the world is really a finite region that tesselates well. Also it's insanely laggy to render offsets more than 8ish times in each direction, so you can detect the offsettinv by seeing how they deal with distant repeats, which will usually be a white void etc. By the way,   when rendering offsets, one teleporrs the camera to the opposite wall of the finite region whenever they touch it, so that you can't reach the white boundary, maintaining the illusion of moving around in an infinite space",

Once I realized this, I understood that I had to break some physics rules. After all “it’s just a game” 😅",

Have testers provide hardware specifications and capture or report performance data to find out minimum specs throughout development  and thus real hardware varieties in architecture, clock behavior, cache sizes, storage speed, thermal limits, and countless other factors that influence performance that VM's CAN'T accurately represent, even with limited CPUs, GPUs, memory configurations.\n\nRegardless though, I find your solution funny OP",

Simply by looking at the gameplay, the difficulty seems pretty high (I’m not a frequent bullet-hell player though), maybe scale it down a notch if this is intended to be an early enemy?\n- Currently, projectiles appear instantly on screen and move with constant speed. Have you tried fading them in just slightly (smoother entrance) and telegraphing some projectiles by first showing them still, then easing to full speed (vs. instant full speed)?\n\nKeep up the great work!",

Every other encounter is optional and serves as preparation for the final the boss. When you beat an enemy you get a currency which you can spend to either heal or increase your base stats.\n\nThis allows the player to tweak the difficulty of the game while playing. However, I design all enemies to be very challenging at Level 1. That said the pattern you saw in the demo is not final as I'm still developing the game.\n\nAs for your second point, thanks for the suggestion. I'll consider it.",
