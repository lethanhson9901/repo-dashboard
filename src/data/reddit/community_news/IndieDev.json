I then did a bit of research and settled on Reaper after trying out other DAWs that had a trial option or were free. It's got a ton of flexibility and since I'm starting, I might as well go with what has a very high ceiling. On top of that, it's compatible with every plugin that I downloaded initially for MPK Mini Plus setup, and I also downloaded a bunch of free plugins afterwards (making sure to read licences). I got a ton of samples and instruments now and I've only been messing with this for a few days. Reaper sounded like it has a steep learning curve, but from my experience, it's not bad at all.

For example: every music that you gona render out of FL studio has a mark on it that it was rendered by FL. So if you didnt buy license and for some reason you will hit some kind of success and sell the game then you can expect lawsuit. So insted of FL use LMMS. Its a bit clunkier, but does everything the same and its more than you need for a pixel game that Im assuming you are working on since you have Aseprite.",

A huge gun suddenly appearing on screen accompanied by a reload animation and obscuring a large chunk of the view is jarring and disorienting, not cool.

Or as you said, adjusting this one a bit. Like maybe make the gun slide in from below and add blur effect to the background at the same time. It would communicate to the player what's happening much better and would make the effect less abrupt.",

Contrary to other ideas I actually like the reload animation, it makes the action feel more frantic and oppressive, like I'm an amateur shooter who has to look down at my gun to reload it in the middle of a shit storm.

Now you have your answer: remove it and move on. But if this is part of your style or your game’s style, work with the feedback and improve it. Indie game dev is also about taking some risks that you can’t do in AAA.\n\nSuggestion: Make it smaller, put it to the edge of the screen or the corner. Understand what the issues are and try to tackle those. Is it easier to just remove it? 100%, but only remove it because YOU think it is not good and doesn’t meet your standards. Not because of others.\n\nMy opinion:\nFor a moment it looks cool but not as a reload visual pop up which happens every few seconds depending on the amount of enemies. After 3 times it will be annoying (the way it is now) and it will break any immersion of the game plus increase anxiety because it blocks the view. I would expect this when I pick up a gun but not for reload.\n\nTo reply a bit on your actual post:\nIt seems like you switched the cameras from 3rd person and minimap “accidentally”.",

I feel he should continue to build upon the idea and make it his unique selling point. An idea I suggested is that during reloads the entire screen zooms into a first person mode not just the gun. While reloading in the cross hairs will allow him to highlight areas of weakness on enemies such as an ankle or the head etc so when the camera zooms back out from reloading he then does critical damage to the enemies turning the reload into a gaming Mechanic itself. There are many ways like this which could justify the kind of look he wants while making it relevant to the gameplay or even a unique selling point without having to just remove it and that’s the power of indie games, not just conforming to what’s already out there but trying something very different and new.",

I play a lot of survival horror games (old resident evil), and milsim (escape from Tarkov), and this feels somewhere in the middle. Having to reload yourself means the reloading is actually skill based, which it is in real life. And the fact it covers nearly the entire screen makes sense, because it takes a lot of muscle memory to be able to reload without looking at your gun. So irl, you would look at your gun to reload properly, and only rely on your peripheral vision to track enemies.\n\nSo yeah, I like the reload animation. Please keep it, even if only optional.\n\nAlso, not a fan of the bottom cam",

Slow is smooth and smooth is fast, and all that jazz.  Anyway, I feel like this system would do a great job of driving that feeling into the player.  That idea of having to lock in and stay smooth under the pressure.\n\nI also think it complements the new additional camera well.  It makes the whole thing less concrete and more of an impression.

I tend to concentrate on the enemies in a top down horde shooters and the camera in the bottom right will most likely never get a glimpse from me unless it's a special reward for killing the last enemy of a wave and I can relax for a moment and watch the kill.\n\nJust my two cents, hope it helps :)",

It would make the enemies harder to see while reloading and add a bit to atmosphere without being so Immersion destroying.",

Kind of like the \"active reload\" in Gears. I would try and work on it more from that angle, by making it more of a mechanic (or not always on the same side because what if enemies approach from the other side) instead of just blocking the screen. Try looking at Persona/Expedition 33 for big flashy UI elements that don't get too in the way of gameplay. If people are complaining about it being distracting you can make them toggle-able, but at the same don't let people who can't handle anything other than plain text and tiles get in the way of your creativity. If you own your stylistic approach and make it standard across the whole game it can help your game stand out from so many boring top-down shooters.",

This is a BIIIG one (and from what we've seen no one ever agrees what makes it soulslike, but for us it's the following!  \n  \n\\- We've made it so that every action you do has a cost, things like jumping, attacking etc all costs stamina, but you also have a secondary resource called heat which you generate by attacking (and spending stamina)\n\n\\- Enemies have patterns and you have to adapt your approach to beat them\n\n\\- We've also included the same ability for the enemies (creating and using heat to do some amazing attacks), so there's no easy fights.\n\nAnd loads more but I don't want to already stretch the wall of text answer you're getting :D",

The way the boat wiggles a little bit as you go for it again helps too. You’re excited to break the ice, I’m excited for you to break the ice, and then you phase straight through it with no collision and the video ends. \n\nIt’s literally the funniest video I’ve seen all week. You’re going in a good direction! I don’t think you need to rethink anything! I like your posts, I’m excited to see how your game turns out :)",

I would much prefer a more traditional action RPG-type game.

I really appreciate you taking the time to share it.\n\nYes, the gameplay choice is very specific and definitely not meant to be a traditional action RPG. It’s strongly tied to my memories of the games I grew up with in the 80s and 90s, and I wanted to follow that feeling rather than aim for something more conventional. There are a lot of games on the market that look and play similarly, and that started to feel a bit uninspiring to me, so I decided to take my own path.\n\nAs for the state of development, I’d say the project is around 30–40% complete. There’s still a lot of work ahead, especially when it comes to animation and overall polish. Scaling the full world I have in mind will likely require more than just myself and the programmer, particularly on the 3D and animation side.",

I believe the animations and the characters are not custom. How much of the environment is custom? Because that's the one thing where I'm kind of blown away, and it looks so good with its own unique style; not fully realistic, but still somewhat realistic, and the lighting is impeccable.\n\nAlso, is the music custom as well, or just placeholder?

I deliberately avoid things like rolls or overly agile moves, because I honestly can’t imagine that in full plate armor.\n\nThat said, I’m not ruling out giving him a bit more freedom later on, but at the moment this is a conscious design rule I’m sticking to 😀",

Two of us built this incremental game in the last *6 months*. I am Thornity; My partner in building the game was [Aarimous](https://www.youtube.com/@Aarimous).\n\nRan a playbook I've been ironing out from being involved with two other games that did modestly well. In short, I did treat it like a system:\n\n* Pick a proven genre and have a clear hook\n* Build the smallest fun loop (our full end-to-end loop is under 6 minutes)\n* Design and build with marketing in mind from the start\n* Ship early, update fast, and be willing to throw out whole concepts that aren’t working\n\nI enjoy giving back to the community. Open to answering any questions or providing context.\n\nCovered a lot of topics about a past successful game and related things to this game:\n\n* Maximizing Steam sales via velocity through discounting: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWidan8ggGo)\n* Hitting $100k success in 400 hours & <3k wishlists at launch: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTbojNXkeJ0)\n* Genre picking, tooling, algo signals, and store page tweaks: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PfLWcEoug8)\n* Unpolished mini-diary vods of making a 100k success: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLoPVwyss2E&list=PLv5k1OwAnhlt1nDDq5xr_sdzTIFdou21L)",

There’s no real downside, and having the page live lets you start getting feedback on your screenshots, capsule, and trailer as soon as you have even a rough version.\n\nI exchanged a few emails with [Chris Zukowski](https://howtomarketagame.com/about/) about this about a year ago. Specifically, how much organic traffic Steam gives a brand new page if you don’t share it anywhere (no posts, no audience, no external links, etc.). The answer was basically: it’s extremely low. Low enough that, on its own, it doesn’t matter.\n\nWhere timing *does* start to matter is the demo. There are a bunch of strategies around running a playtest first, building some audience momentum, and then launching the demo in a way that gives you a shot at showing up on trending demos.",

Otherwise, it looks like you’re just going to go around in a circle and be done with it.\n\n- if I was an ice-controlling, witch who can only move when I’m not being looked at, I’d figure out ways to break line of sight. Maybe have her drop or summon occasional ice walls or pillars that break line of sight for the player. That would make it feel like she’s actually hunting you and you can’t just rely on her being there in the center. It’d also create a maze-like effect where you have to work to find the eye poles.\n\nAnyway, just some ideas.",

You say she moves when you are not looking at her, and it sounds like that is the main mechanic of the fight. But why would you ever look away from her? \n\nThe only attack comes from her, so you want to be looking at her to dodge it. The eye totem things are in a circle, so if you just move in a circle you will find one eventually and don't have to actively look around. There are no obstacles/hazards on the ground, so theres no reason to look where you are going. And like others have said theres no challenge to the dodging since you can just hold left/right and you are good. So the strategy is just hold left till you find a totem, then kill it, then repeat.\n\nThere needs to be something more. For example, she has an additional attack that fills random patches of the ground with spikes for a few seconds, so you need to look around to avoid them. It would also make dodging her other attack harder since you can't just hold a direction because you would run into a spike.",

          "text": "To add some feedback:\n- As others commented, movement is slow, and doesn't feel good\n- The path of the ice attack feels too predictable. That's good, if it's supposed to be a very easy boss, but bad if you expect any kind of challenge\n- The \"frozen if looking at it\" is nice in theory, but I see some problems with the current implementation:\n  - It's rotating and attacking. I understand that it's just \"\"not moving\"\" in a quite gramatical way, but the concept feels not fully integrated\n  - Her name is \"The ice witch\". There's nothing that tells me that \"looking at her\" will do anything. Lorewise, it feels bland. You could \"explain it to the player\", but, as usual, show, don't tell. And yes, the player could \"detect the pattern\" after fighting a bit. But it would look very arbitrary (again, lorewise).\n  - Are there any visual/audio clues of it not being able to move when looking at her? In the video you're always looking at her, so hard to tell. It could be interesting. Paradoxically, you can't just change the model or anything, because _you can't see her when you're not looking at her_. Maybe some audio\n- The eyes, I'm supposing you have to kill them before reaching her? If that's it, it would be nice to have also some visual clues of why is it that way. Is she invulnerable? Is she stronger? Hard to tell. This is a nitpick; many games let you discover it the hard way (like souls-likes, or even WoW bosses), so it depends on the kind of game and difficulty. And how much it hurts to fail.\n\nI see this is the final boss of the homonymous game; part of the feedback is thinking about it as just another boss, so take it with a grain of salt. Good work!",

              "text": "Thanks for the comment. I've had a lot to think about with what everyone has said.\n\nYes, the video shows the player's slow walk speed, and not their sprint speed. That was a mistake on my part. An adjustment in movement is a change that I can definitely make.\n\nI did intend for the ice attack to be predicable. I was trying to consider a wide range of player skill levels/reaction times, but I may need to rethink how I'm doing that. Maybe with a difficulty setting in the main menu.  \n\nAs for the Weeping Angel mechanic, up until the battle, she has functioned in the usual sense of being completely frozen in place when in view, stalking the player as they travel through the environment, appearing in the shadows, and attacking only if you let her get too close to you. When you’re not looking, she makes ice crackling sounds and laughs to indicate that she is moving toward you. Lorewise, I thought of her as being a \"living ice sculpture.\" To better incorporate this idea into the final battle, I agree with what a lot of people have suggested to add things in the arena that force you to break line of sight. That would prevent her from simply being locked the whole time.\n\nThe main narrative of the game is that you are trying to free your wife from a curse that has turned her into this witch. That tall obelisk in the center of the arena is basically possessing her. You discover the player character's motivation and relationship to the witch over the course of the game via clues found around the environment.  It's not shown in the video, but you cannot attack the witch directly. If you try, she will take no damage and teleport away behind you. Your real focus is to destroy the eyes and the obelisk. This battle takes place at the end of the game after you've trekked through a cold snowy forest, collecting magic gems to forge a weapon strong enough to break that obelisk and the curse. There is an underlying emotional element to this fight. The player character doesn't actually want to harm her. He wants to heal her. And he is thrown into this battle reluctantly.\n\nI think there may be a disconnect in the story I wanted to portray and the mechanics that I'm using to do so.\n\nThis is also my first post in this sub. I had no idea it would get this much response, and for that I am truly grateful. I plan on using what I've learned here to make the game better.",

If someone would attack me I wouldn't go away at a snails pace, I'd pick up my speed and run.\n\nWeeping Angels are cool n all, but the issue is that you are not giving the player any reason to look anywhere BUT the witch. Okay, there's three floating eyes I guess, but like you did in the clip, I can just walk back and left to get to where I wanna be without even looking away. If you are giving us an enemy like that, you also NEED to give us a reason to look away. An additional enemy, ice traps, etc. Something we also need to look out for.\n\nThe ice wall seems...boring. Safe, almost. It seems to aim at where you are currently, not where you are going to go. So I can just press A or D and I'll be safe the entire time.",

I would add a small animation to the witch before she attacks (like she's getting her arms up) so the player would see that ice spikes are on the way\n\n4. Add another attack for the witch.

Idk. Overall great concept, it is clear in the trailer, I do think it looks a little jarring but also is necessary to convey the mechanic at first, so yeah tough needle to thread.\n\nI also wasn’t sure at first if the cursor being there was how it would look in game, until it disappeared Galway in. So maybe keeping a transparent cursor for the first part of the trailer or some sort of fade/transform of the cursor into the character?",

Only thing I would change is the hint system - rather than showing instantly where a hidden object is I think it would be better if the camera just moved into the general location of something so that you still get the experience of finding it rather than the game showing you exactly where it's at. If you make follow ups to this that would be the only thing I would change.",

There's zero arguing on the genre and inspiration, it's arguably a MC clone itself. But it's also very much its own game, with its own vibe/aesthetics/mechanics/etc. doing its own unique things. That's the expectation. \n\nThis sub is bizarre. Someone posted their Balatro clone with Blackjack the other day and got power-fisted over it, because the concept and UI was too similar.

Doing that for over a year is much cheaper than trying to get thousands of wishlists in a month before releasing, and the targeting ensures that I am not showing the ads to people that don't really care about a strategy game, which would probably waste a ton of ad budget and not buy the game when I release it.",

There was an article in a German gaming website that brought over 1000 wishlists over a week.  \nI think about half of the wishlists are probably from advertising (in Reddit, Youtube and Meta ads), and the rest from those articles/videos and steam visibility.\n\nThis is the latest trailer I have been using: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aa5SAbrrF0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aa5SAbrrF0)",

Thank you for wishlisting!!\n\nYes, here you have resources and you can produce units and also build new factories and defenses.\n\nI just added the option to procedurally generate rectangular maps too [last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastGeneral/comments/1prh2bz/now_maps_can_be_long_rectangles_too_10km_x_40km/), so they can be 10km x 40km for example. The maximum area of 400km2 is because of gameplay reasons, Unity floating point precision and performance.   \nAfter +/- 10km you lose milimeter precision in Unity so things start looking a bit choppier than I would like, but it's not that noticeable. Performance on such huge maps is a bigger issue, and the gameplay becomes extremely long and slow (which is really cool, but probably not for everyone). Imagine sending your troops from one side of the map to another and they take 30 minutes to drive there, it's pretty crazy.\n\nPlanes in the game come from off-map allies or mainland for nations that have a mainland outside of the TLG archipelago so the size of the island doesn't affect them that much, they just come flying, shoot at something and flee.",

The conversations were promising. They liked the art style, the retention on the vertical slice was decent, and the mechanics were tight.\n\nThen I get an email on Tuesday: \"We want to hold off unless we can see a co-op build by end of month.\"\n\nI hopped on a call, thinking maybe I misunderstood the timeline.\n\nTheir reasoning? They saw the numbers Lethal Company and Content Warning were doing and decided that social virality is a requirement for their portfolio now.\n\nThey literally said, \"Can’t you just let a second player spawn in? We don't need dedicated servers yet, just P2P.\"\n\nI had to explain, politely, that a deterministic simulation built entirely for single-player logic doesn't just accept a second input stream without rewriting the entire core loop and netcode from scratch.\n\nThey passed on the project. Honestly, it's probably for the best, but the trend-chasing is getting exhausting.\n\nHow do you guys handle it when non-technical partners think Multiplayer is just a feature you toggle in the engine settings?\n\n",

Spoiler alert, they all skipped that part.\n\n>the trend-chasing is getting exhausting\n\nThat's the reality we live in: MVPs with massive traction aka. sure bets (even made a short clip of Gollum saying those two words, lol, because it's soo frustrating to hear over and over). They say you should only reach out to those publishers who are most compatible, but what if there isn't any because all they want is a copy of an already existing game? (so your and their taste will never match)\n\n*And gamers tout that the renaissance of indie gaming is coming. From where though?*\n\nWhile you dodged a bullet, the market isn't better higher up either (at larger publishers); in fact worse, 'cos you'll be lucky to talk to one in person.",

If they aren’t able to effectively market the game they may need the game to market itself by friends getting friends to play with them.\n\nI’m not saying SP games of this sort can’t be successful (and I know that there are tons of anecdotal examples of success). I’m saying that I understand why a small publisher would make this call.\n\nAs for the requirement to add MP in a month. Maybe that’s them completely underestimating what it would take. Or maybe they decided they couldn’t carry a SP game and were providing this option in the off-chance it would be possible (maybe you had designed it as player agnostic event driven from the start). Either way I suspect the we’re trying to be nice by saying no, but offering an out (even an impossible one).\n\nFor you, it’s worth considering their concerns and the reasons why they don’t think your game is viable for them. Maybe they are wrong. Maybe you have another way to address the concerns. But it’s worth considering (even if you decide not to react).",

I have experienced this by the way. \n\nSo you post online on itch.io but there is another problem nobody is interested in trying prototypes that look visually bad even if gameplay is good \n\nThe only exception I have found is unless you are already a reputable developer or have an existing audience like on YouTube or any social media platform then it will work out.\n\nIdk I find it incredibly hard when developers say it validate your ideas fast, because how the hell do you do that when you don't have money to throw or don't have an existing reputation. Even if you are an experienced developer it will still be hard to validate whether something is actually good or not \n\nThe way I am going about it currently is probably to make a basic prototype, see if I even like it. Then give it to developer friends and see their reactions, give it to close friends , see what they tell , which can still be deceiving. Then personally decide based on how the internal testing went whether to pursue doing a vertical slice.\n\nWhen the vertical slice is done then I think it's worth doing an free itch release to see what people think ,at this point I think you can get pretty good visibility based on the genre you are making. This is the only I feel you can get good feedback from everybody.\n\n\nEven then this can still take anywhere from 2 to 4 months or even more which is still quite long.",

But some will mention some things that will give you \"evrika\" moments. \n\nFor me it was when players complained about noise, and even one of them suggested instead of doing granular damage instances that happen all over the place, to \"collect it\" and do all the damage at once. Or that the dungeon progression I have planned was not fun and there wasn't any real choice, and that they would have liked it to be a 2d dungeon with rooms and different paths. This helped me get to a 3rd prototype which I'm working to have it go through another playtest soon (I'm just prototyping and getting feedback for the past 2 months).",

This would be the absolute number 1 reason even above funding (because technically it replaces some necessary funding). Publishers tend to already have a name that audiences are familiar with. They tend to already have a marketing network ready, and they tend to already be better at it than you.\n- funding. You can cut potential funding deals to keep your development viable.\n- experience. They likely have more combined experience than you, and probably across platforms you haven't published on yet also, so that's a plus.\n\nNone of this is to say that self publishing is impossible or shouldn't be done, but publishers (good ones) are good.",

I think what kept me going is having a vision of what kind of game I wanted, and just having this feeling that I have to keep going to see this game become real. I didn't feel that as strongly until I started this game, so I think just truly working on what I wanted to work on, instead of what I thought other people might like, was the main thing that pushed me. But either way, it kinda just becomes a routine after a while. Like it wasn't even a question, I'd just get up and work on the game every day, and that was my default!\n\nThank you for your kind words :) good luck with your game development!!",

I don't know what your systems are so I cant reccomend specifics, but something meta like Chronos unpausing your game in hades or the act three bosses in Inscryption doing things like messing with your hard drive could be something that makes the player sit up and pay attention. If you dont want meta though maybe she has a gimmick like the first time they fight her she has 99% damage reduction and after the fight they realize they need to go around and collect some kind of trinket where each one reduces the reduction if its a collectathon, could have her introduce a new mechanic or gimmick, or maybe each time they fight her she turns off a random ability or item the player has to force them to change things up.\n\nTLDR: Imo if hags say that the players don't know the extent of their powers they should be able to do something that suprises the player rather than merely being an escalation of the difficulty using the current systems",

Sadly, I already see someone else monetizing this in some way.\n\nThat said, I feel it's time for anyone involved in software to take a closer look at their code and consider more hardware efficient solutions. \n\nBack in the days, it was mandatory to come up with creative solutions to work with the given hardware, knowing it would take years for anyone to even consider buying a new system with better specs, not to mention the money required. The limitations were real and everyone was eager to make it work with the system resources at hand.\n\nThese days, everything keeps getting unnecessarily convoluted  because the expectation is that any hardware related problem will be solved with the next generation of higher performance hardware. People don't even try to make use of what is in front of them anymore. Just buy better X is such a knee-jerk reaction atm.\n\nThis essentially impacts innovation imho, because people don't see the value in figuring out a different approach when better hardware is on the horizon anyways.\n\nActually, it's a really detrimental mindset in tech in general, but also in other sectors. It highly impacts product design decisions, which is why we usually have to purchase stuff that has an expiration date one way or another. It sure is incentivized by capitalism, but there are plenty of people willing to submit to this regardless because it's easier not to invest brainpower into solving problems.\n\nMaybe this is the catalyst we need as a society to reorient ourselves and question the status quo in general. And find better ways to design and create products, that make use of their full potential, that are more efficient, increased use cycles, less waste, etc.",

(Which usually carries all the info but in a small chunk)\n\nCPUs and GPUs can store VERY small amounts of data (like in kilobytes) to use without needing the RAM, I'm trying to pre-package the data to send it there as one block, but keep it accessible at any time.  \n\nThe point is being able to grab whatever you need directly, and in one go, this is hacky to do in the usual pipelines.  \n\nAlso, I'm planning to use textures for model resolution, not polygons, Like I can store a texture that tells how \"high\" this pixel is (from the model surface)\nWhen I render, I can check which pixel is close in 3D space, not just which polygon.  \n\n\nBTW, I'm not rendering triangles in the GIF, nor faces or anything like that, each block is just the vertex itself, like the pixels close to it detect it and show \"I found this vertex\" on screen\nThey can find the closest vertex regardless of the range, so it the model is huge with very few verts, it would still work fine.  \n\n\nIf this works as intended, we won't need anti aliasing, there will be no aliasing with 3D interpolation (interpolation+filtering is used for textures only rn, which is why they don't flicker like models do)\n\n\nIf this was confusing, feel free to ask me about any details, this is my first time explaining my system so yeah\n\n\nAs for compute shaders vs raster:\nCompute shaders allow you to send, edit, and use any data\nRaster is older and only allows certain types of data at certain times, but is usually used because it is VERY fast in processing a lot of polygons, there is dedicated hardware for it.  \n\nBut most of modern shading is expensive because it needs hacky solutions around it, so I figured try a different way",

          "text": "So like, very nice work, but the biggest issue when something like this is that you'll also need to make the game yourself too (if I'm understanding things right) and i very much doubt you'll have as much fun playing your own game compared to someone elses.\n\nA better approach would be what Nvidia has been pushing for, instead of a regular engine you make your own that would wrap around the game and upscale fps and resolution. Idk if devil may cry boots at all now, but if it does at 5fps you'd kinda start at that and paint over your own effects.\n\nYou can look up the comrade stinger demo on YouTube and coverage by Linustechtips and2kliksphillip - but it's basically what allows Oculus mobile to exist and what the next gen Nvidia reflex will have. And yes it's super difficult, hence why nobody is actually bothering, but if you choose your own game it should be possible. Kinda like a custom updated lossless scaling version. \n\nFor most people, if you divide the number of hours it would take you to program it, it's just better to freelance/help someone else with something regular and basic and just buy the new gpu. You're really selling your skills at a loss by coding something like this\n\nEdit: of course if you're actually making a game for others that's great, i missed the subreddit name",

(Based on success ofc)  \n\nCan't really work a job or freelance because of health issues, very unpredicatble, so the only thing I can stick with is sth without strict timelines.  \n\nI am curious about the NVidia thing tho, is it like an \"engine\" that can modify the output of games? Maybe I can try it at some point, it's the total opposite of what I'm doing (and something I actually tried) but sounds like fun on the side.  \n\nThanks for the thoughtful comment",

But the most accessible explanation is the comrade stinger demo, even tho it's hardcoded in engine its at least open source. \n\nThe regular person thing at the moment is lossless scaling on steam, which is something someone made to be available to more gpus than what Nvidia wanted to arbitrarily lock theirs to.

          "text": "Since AI is the hot potato right now:\n\nBig companies will use AI more and more. They will face backlash on social media without noticeable impact on their sales, which will prompt AI developers to become more common.\n\n\\- Indie devs will use \"no AI\" marketing strategies, with an emphasis on traditional art techniques. They will get a lot of praise for it, with a few of them getting actual financial success thanks to luck and an original and talented art direction. However, AI will creep into most development environments through less obvious means such as code assistance, AI-enhanced procedural level generation, etc.\n\nIndie devs will have to choose between the easy low-budget route (with public backlash) and the hard, uncertain route.\n\nWell-intentioned companies and solo devs will commission artists whom they trust, but who will use AI in their back. More controversies, more backlash, money and time will be lost.\n\nThe most major technical breakthrough will (I hope) be a VR live sandbox world generator, which will be ignored by most of the public because of VR set prices.\n\nGodot, Unity, Unreal and other engines will integrate coding agents/assistants.\n\nEveryone will get the uneasy feeling that it's an 'adapt or fail' situation.\n\nI'll keep programming for the love of the game tho.\n\nOh and my hand-drawn AI-free 2D platformer, Hachichi will release.",
