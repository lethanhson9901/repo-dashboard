Then you got the more experienced and more established artists who will charge you maybe up to $1000 and more depending complexity especially and then you got industry professionals that also work with and for serious studios and who have a prestige, name and experience and skills that will charge you easily up to several thousands of dollars for a capsule art but those bring more to the table than people think. Its more than just about polished looking capsule/key art and something lower tier of artists simply lack.\n\nProfessional artist here.",

                  "text": "I'd like to add on to this that a good clause for a commercial use contract like capsule art etc, is to make the up front flat fee a non-refundable advance on royalties, and include in the agreement a royalties fee which caps out at a higher flat amount. Say 3 to 5 times the initial amount given up front. This helps keep the startup cost lower while not taking advantage of the artist unfairly in the case where their art helps a product go viral for serious sales numbers. \n\nExample math: artist is paid $300 for a piece of marketing art such as Steam capsule art. The contract specifies this as an advance, non-refundable, on a 1% royalty on gross of all sales past the first 1000 copies. The royalty fee is scheduled to cap out at $1500 total, 5x the advance. The game is sold at a price where the developer gets $6. Therefore, until the game sells 6000 copies, the artist isn't owed anything more. Many games will never reach this benchmark and the contract becomes effectively a flat fee. If the game sells 26,000 copies, the cap will be reached, so even if it goes on to sell a million copies, the artist's financial interest in it is terminated past that point.\n\nFor the developer, $1500 from the sales gross of $156,000 is well worth paying for a key presentation piece without which those sales likely wouldn't happen. For the artist, getting the extra payday when the game releases and does well prevents resentment at not benefiting from that performance in proportion to their contribution. If the game sells really exceptionally well even beyond that, well, probably the developer should hire the same artist again for future projects, and pay more up front this time.",

I think the updated title text is actually the only thing the artist did better; neither capsule really conveys much, but at least the original looks less generic. Even with the silly face? in the helmet. !<",

The knight looks generic, but I'm stuck handling kid stuff right now so I can't go look at the game's page to get a feel for options that could have been explored.\n- Old one has an interesting charm to the eye element, but the rest is not visually legible. There is something there, but it's not workable.\n- Artist should have worked with you and let you approve a mockup, design concept, approval draft, or similar. I'd be pissed at being left in the dark then presented with a \"final\" without approval. But if the artists did keep you in the loop and you did approve delivery, then it is what it is.\n\nThere are some tricks with exposing eyes and human faces that'll capture people's attention better, as it's basically hardwired into every animal's brain to look for eyes and spend some processing power to identify what happens next. That's the charm in the first one that I think other people are getting too. But I can't say which one is better without more research because the most important thing with key art is to set up the promise your game intends to deliver on.",

So if you're effectively working in 8-bit, 16 bit, 32 bit, your pixel count and size will be appropriate for that style. When you start seeing pixels of irregular shape, meaning some squares are larger than others, and lines that are not quite uniform, then that is a hallmark sign of being AI generated, or someone just tried to slap a \"pixel effect\" on an image.  \n  \nEdit: meant to say 'Pixel art resolution (like 32×32, 64×64, 320×240)'. \n  \nAnother way to articulate it is: In true pixel art, all pixels align to a consistent grid, and artists make deliberate, manual decisions at the individual pixel level. If you see inconsistent pixel sizing, blurred edges, or grid misalignment, it’s often a sign that the image was either AI-generated or created by applying a pixelation filter rather than being hand-crafted pixel art.",

          "text": "I guess take this with a grain of salt given all the feedback haha, but for what’s its worth, I can appreciate the redesign and could see how the price was fair for the work.\n\nThe typography on the new design is nice and the coloring and the iconography does a good job of both conveying the knight theme and the incremental aspect in a way your original didn’t. You’re essentially buying a logo redesign and character art and background which feels like it would reasonably cost a certain amount to cover an artist’s time.\n\nThat being said, I do understand the concerns too, I think my first instinct was also wondering whether it was a great deal. A few things people have mentioned - the new character is a bit generic, the pose is a bit stiff, I personally think some stronger lighting or maybe some particles could make the scene composition look more interesting. The character is also smaller in the new design, which means that it’s harder to appreciate when tiny. \n\nI was wondering if potentially the layout of your post made this scale effect even more pronounced, as seeing all the time and cost spelled out leaves even less room for the artwork to shine haha. I do think if I zoom in I like the new design better. \n\nOf course, capsule art needs to be read at a small scale in general, but if the artist is delivering something that took time and craft and detail to produce but wasn’t exactly what you needed, maybe that’s something more indicative of needing closer portfolio review or instruction than being a rip off necessarily.\n\nAnyway all that just to say I think it wasn’t a total loss to commission the logo redesign and wishing you all the best with the game! :)",

Could maybe be a little faster and cheaper but for a custom waist/up illustration + background combined with a stylized logo, that is about the price range I’d expect although I would definitely be wanting the files, as they are yours. People in the comments here are overreacting tbh, I’ve done logo design for 10ish years and while I rarely ever have a reason to charge over 100, if someone asked me for a custom illustration to go along with the logo then it would definitely float around 250ish but that’s also under the assumption that I’m giving them all art files to use how they want, background, character, etc. I think it looks fine, but if you want changes just ask for them, the artist likely factored revisions into the price and if not, then they are charging too much.",

I think this game is def a gem so it would be well worth putting some investment into a good capsule artist if you can afford it. Great work, and best of luck! :)",

          "text": "Assuming this is an idler/incremental game off the title, I'm going to go a bit against the other people here - this art works just fine as an advertisement. I'm not saying it's outstanding, or unique, but it should work well enough that I would just take this as a lesson in getting pricing quotes and confirming the artist's vision is in line with yours. \n\nWhile most games (and products in general) are made/broken by the first image in the advertisement, they also exist in the context of people in the market for similar products. If this was some combination of pixel-art side-scrolling RPG rogue-lite then the generic art style would probably make people wary of the product and question why they should buy it over the other dozen beside it, but for idlers it just needs to look professional enough to stand marginally above the sea of free titles you're competing with for attention. Take this with a mountain of salt, but there is a chance that a decent colour palette and composition will go further in this genre than a soulful style and consistent details/proportions - although, of course, anyone would usually prefer all of the above. Shit, the outlining/drop-shadowing of the title is probably more important to catching eyes than the design of the knight.\n\nSo, even though people have raised a lot of valid concerns with the piece, I would probably scroll down a Steam search of idlers and imagine your game sitting beside them at whatever price point you're looking at. Do you think it stands out enough to get some traffic? Is the title too small when scaled down to the size it will display as on the Steam search? Is it the most expensive title a dozen games either direction? Do the other visuals on the page stand out enough to convert traffic into purchases? Do they accurately display how your game will be similar/different to other games in the genre? You're advertising an idler game to a bunch of idler fans, not a video game to nondescript video game fans. Would you yourself give the game a chance, as (presumably) a fan of the genre?\n\nPlaying with a few filters myself, I'm seeing a lot of blank or single-detail backgrounds which only show off the title. The ones that aren't often look too busy, as if they're a wall poster and not the thumbnail to a Steam game. Could yours be executed better, both generally as a piece of art and specifically as the advertisement to an idler game? Yeah, in many regards. But, as a random internet commenter, it looks better than plenty of what I'm seeing, including games with some attention. Paid idlers are very hit-or-miss since they compete with so many free titles, but yours still looks more professional than many of the hits.",

          "text": "I don’t think it’s terrible. But I wanted to comment more on the general conversation in the comments. Artists in the industry get paid livable amounts. The capsule art can be what makes a person even pay attention to your game. I’m not commenting on whether this artist deserves it or not with their drawing, but in general. $300 for a full illustration piece for capsule art is cheap. The internet has just done a great job at devaluing the work it takes. Their are INCREDIBLE artists you could commission for this, but they will charge you more.\n\nJust like with tattoos.. you get what you pay for a lotta the time. I’m not saying you specifically did wrong, $300 isn’t a terrible idea of how much to pay, I’m really just responding to those who think it’s too much in general. And if it is, then learn to draw yourself (I mean it not sarcastically). \n\nAnd to comment on this specific art: I have a hard time seeing AI in pixel art, but to me it looks like it’s made legitimately. If they had done AI there probably would be more to it. Did you like the artist’s other work? I feel hesitate to say this cause I seem to be in the minority here, but if I saw this capsule art I would click on it. I honestly mean that, I promise I’m not saying it just to be contrarian. It gives off a similar vibe to other games I like to play, so I could give it enough attention to click.",

One of the tells of AI is that it is absolutely terrible at pixelart as it requires consistency of format (i.e., not mixels) which are all over this piece. It looks like it was generated and downsized... The title alone is very rough.\n\nI'd be pretty upset by this. Did the artist have a following or portfolio?",

The knight theme gets it across albeit kind of bland.  Tho for what you're getting is okay, kind of crazy for commenters to say it's super fucking terrible.  Paying comparingly to like $3.75/hr if they spent 80hrs or $7.5/hr if they did this in 40hrs.\n\nAgree with the rest of the comments tho, you definitely get a better return if you iterated a new capsule yourself. (Especially the composition of your knight/bg is still very visually interesting tho muted in colors so not recognizable first glance) Take reddit opinions with a grain of salt tho cause you're getting the most vocal minority than actual data of people choosing to click on this or not.",

For me i try to update throughout the process at every part especially if the commissioner is paying that much, but even if it was a cheap commission I try to update constantly to make sure everything is to the commissioners liking... it makes me wonder why they didnt do that? I get that every artist has different methods and such but it seems like the bare minimum to at least check in?... and in no way is their art bad! But i do think they should've checked in to at least see if you liked it? Especially for the price.. but again back to their other work, is this similar to their other work they've done or youve seen or is this much more sloppy or what? And what did you originally ask for? Or did you want a legit just pixel version of the reference photo? Sorry i dont mean to pry im just curious lol [again not blaming you for anything and not hating on the artist just wondering what the communication was like lol] \n\n[IN COMING SELF PROMOTION OF MY OWN COMMISSIONS AND ART THAT DOES NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE POST AT HAND READ UPON YOUR OWN WILL]\nbut besides that if do commissions like I said so if anyone in the comments or OP if you guys want a commission i might as well use this comment to somewhat advertise myself lol, but i have multiple examples of my art on my profile as well as more examples i can send through dms, I can do animation as well as art in general, I'm fine with drawing/animating : ocs,ships,furry,nsfw,gore,sfw,backgrounds,dynamic poses,i can also imitate other anime styles,and more[just ask] (i just have alot of mha on my profile because thats my fav anime and alot of people who commission also really likes that anime lol but I ofcourse do more than mha, and all nsfw content on my profile is hidden but if you want examples of past coms ive done let me know through dms)\nI allow commissioners to set the price they think is fair to pay that way I dont overprice or underprice my art🧍\nAnd as far as payment goes i only take payment either upfront or half upfront and half afterwords, and as far as how I take payments I can take it in forms of giftcards[usd],cashapp, or revolut[worldwide currency transfer app so I can take almost any currency]\nI have many references of past people who have commissioned me, and as far as work around time I try to get work done quick and usually start on drawing right after payment is sent unless I have responsibilities to take care of in real life at that moment[school,chores,family] and I have no problem with working within time lines and or picky critiques, I have no problem with redrawing something untill to someones liking and I give constant updates at everyday from rough pose scetch, rough scetch, lineart, and coloring/rendering.\nAs far as rules I have for myself that I'm not willing to budge on is that I will not take payment afterwards, it is either payment upfront or half payment upfront and then the other after\n\nbut if you would like a commission just dm me on here and then we can go from there and I can show more of my work^^\nI also have both a tiktok and an insta were you can see some of my work there than too^^ just ask^^\nAnd alot of commissioners tend to like to continue conversation over to discord and I also have one of those sk if youd like just ask for my tag ir send yours^^",

          "text": "This is a classic case of \"blind\" fate in an artist that shouldn't exist.  \n(I mean the blind fate shouldn't exist.)\n\nFor 300$, the artist should have proposed various sketches. Not dozens, but a few based on his interpretation of the final work. We're talking composition. Maybe ask you if you want some specific tones or colors too. That's for early. Then, he should have, at least, shown you a more advanced composite of the work. Not final, but something just to know if he's going the right way. Then, if at the end, the result is as shown, then yes you paid for what you got regardless of what's being said by other.\n\nThe worse that people can do is give a \"sketch\", some screenshots, a pile of money and let any artist cooks, unless the artist has been working with you or on the game extensively enough to understand what the game is about visually.\n\nFor example, for a dungeon crawler game with graphics like Terraria, that result is worth the 300$ as long as you get the source file. It's also important to know where the artist is located because the representation of values is different between countries even if it's proposed on the same platform.\n\nFor example, being a graphic designer who has over 23 years of experience in Canada, that 300$ would barely cover 5 hours of my time (and I'm actually on the cheap side, price-wise). I would have taken 1 hours to make sketches for suggesting better composition & colors and fonts styles, 2 hours of actual work and maybe 1 hours in communications involved with the sketches and mid-journey development. Then the remaining hour would be fixes and/or adjustments if necessary.\n\nThe *2 weeks* means absolutely nothing. It's not like the artist worked 8 hours per day for 2 weeks, but more like he had a number of things to work on and it took 2 weeks to work on your and finish it.",

She then sent me between 20 and 30 sketches for the artwork and title. After a few revisions, we arrived at the final version, which I am very happy with. I am not an artist, so I think it is very useful to take the artist's point of view into account; in the end, they can see better what works.",

The bottom one evokes feelings of claustrophobia and paranoia, whereas the top evokes feelings of isolation. The top font feels somewhat whimsical and makes me think of ski slopes, whereas the bottom feels like it's for horror.\n\nI would say that the top one looks like an arcade game where you're trying to get as much gold as you can and shovel your way through the snow while avoiding the dark figures. The bottom looks like a short story focused game that has fairly simple gameplay.\n\nThey both look very good so if I saw either in a storefront my choice in which to click would be based on which style of game I prefer. I personally would be more likely to check out the bottom game. Taking a look at the game on Steam, I feel like the top image better evokes the idea of the game (or at least the idea that I got from the trailer on Steam)",

Yours looks like you used an open source font. Not bad and the snow effect over it helps. But with the “painted” look and repeating characters it has a thematic clash.\n\nThe artists one I like the regular type face style for Froggy and Snow. And going with a different look for Hates. Unfortunately it looks too similar to the title art for Hades (and some of that is just the similar spelling)\n\nMaybe swap their Hates for yours. Or recommend a change from a “wind blown” look to an “icicle”. Froggy hates the snow and ice not the wind. Then maybe you could move the shovel icon to the word Hates next to Froggy, giving it a more “in snow” look. And making the shovel an aspect of Froggy",

          "text": "I think the first one is better. The second one seems more bland to me tbh. I think it's the open perspective and the crisp imagiry of the second that kind of doesn't work for me. When I look at it I'm not really sure, what to expect. The frog sits there in the foreground basically in an open scenery. There are menacing statues behind them but the frog seems expressionless. In an open plane it seems weird that the frog is where it is. It also seems weird that it should give me the feeling of a snowstorm but also all the graphics seem extremely crisp aside from the little detail snowflakes in front of the objects. That's why the image only evokes the idea of a shovel ware action movie poster/dvd cover for me. The first image actually conveys a feeling of being snowed in to me. The perspective is more limited which in turn makes me understand why the frog just sits there. There is no other place to go even when the menacing statues are right behind. The second one might be better from a technical perspective but personally I think the artistic vision of it is confusing at best while the first image clearly conveys a feeling and an idea that lets my mind construct around it.\n\nIf I look at the first image I expect a really well made indi game with style and vision. When I look at the second image I expect a somewhat lacking game from a corporate setting. (Aside from companies never daring to create something that looks this experimental.)\n\nOf course that is just my opinion. Explaining why art does what it does is difficult and maybe someone else sees it completely differently. But I hope my perspective helps.",

Mix and master were an additional payment (a friend did it at a discounted rate of 150e per track).  ",

I would either reword that or just get rid of the word quesiton and replace it with something more impactful. A narrator with that voice wouldn't use the word \"question\" there. It's not a question. We're talking life or death, world ending vs world saving. I would consider something in the realm of Moment of truth, final test, trial, not that exactly plugged into that sentance but you get the idea. Maybe consider rewording that part in general.\n\n\"Or will you beleive the lie of choice\". I love where this monologue is going but I'm not loving the \"lie of choice\" part there. I would reword this as well. The word \"Temptation\" comes to mind. I think of that scene in Indiana Jones where they have to choose the cup. Everyone gets infatuated with the fancy cups. They lose sight of the mission and end up having their soul sucked dry haha. Your character is facing a trial on his question. And they must maintain composure and strength and not succumb to temptation or greed. Idk. I feel like there's better wording in that for that monologue.\n\nEdit: Maybe \"lie of choice\" makes more sense in the context of you're game? I have no idea, obviously. You know better than I.",

Idk if you are a fan of FF7 but you can checkout [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GsXtxxKqEg) and see how they remade the original soundtracks but still kept the charm of the original melodies by putting focus on the original melodies accompanied by orchestra quality.\n\nI think orchestras should actually be more involved in game soundtracks these days, just don't forget that it's about the melody and not about the orchestra.",

          "text": "Many people have asked the same questions so for easier reference here are the answers:  \n1. It was recorded in North Macedonia in FAMES  \n2. The price was around 2000e for 56 people for one hour session + recording engineer and studio and conductor  \n3. I paid an additional mix/master fee of 150e to a friend (discounted price)   \n4. I managed to record two tracks, around 3 min total\n\nBelow are some things I have learned from this experience: \n\n* I prepared the scores. I have been composing for a long time, but last 6 years I have been learning classical harmony and voice leading and other “academic” music disciplines.\n* That said I did not read through several books (usually 800-1000 pages) of orchestration, but I did reference some (especially for harp). I watched a Udemy tutorial → about 20 hours on orchestration that really has a good digest of everything that is most important and many youtube videos where people explain their particular instrument and techniques in great detail.\n* Even though I really enjoyed the Udemy course I triple checked with several people that I know have recorded real orchestras and there were some discrepancies in opinions and I used my best judgment.\n* For instance wether you should write a key signature. Many people say that its easier for the musicians in these intense sight reading and recording situations to not use a key signature. Ultimately my music is tonal and I decided to keep them in.\n* Second was about horns, its important to write for horns 1 and 3 to be the upper voice or voices and horns 2 and 4 to be the bottom voice or voices. This is very counter intuitive and requires getting used to.\n* Take care of your groupings. This composition is in 10/16 and I group in 3+3+2+2. The score is super readable that way. With default Dorico setting it would be HORROR to read.\n* Timpani - I was afraid what I wrote would not make sense as the pitches I needed were slightly out of the range of some drums, but this is the big takeaway: these people are professionals. This guy has been playing timpani his whole life, he knew in an instant how to solve the problem. Even though I had 4 pitches, he played it on two drums. So what I am trying to say is unless you write something that is really unplayable these people will make it happen.\n* The only way to really learn is to do it. I think this one orchestral session has taught me more than 10 books and years of lessons (but ideally you will do both). Music has best practices, but even among the hard rules people disagree so just try to find the thing that works for you and people you work with.\n* You have to know to play and at least understand an instrument(s) or know people who can tell you whats what, so that you can decide how much time you actually need for the recording session (one hour is minimum). I had two compositions. Each slightly over a minute, both in odd time signatures. One was uptemo, the other downtempo. We barely made it in one hour, and probably the result would have been much better if we had a bit more time. The downtempo was considerably easier and took less takes to get right.\n* Don’t write at the extreme edge of the instruments range.\n* I was thinking about where the winds and brass would breath, but the musicians told me not to worry, that they will figure it out on their own.\n* Check you parts since notation programs can do crazy stuff when exporting.\n* Condensed VS full score for conductor: honest answer, I don’t know and they probably don’t care.\n* Full orchestra VS recording sections. For the sound its much better to record sections. Its probably going to be more expensive, but not much more since some sections don’t play all the time so you need less time with them. BUT, hearing the full orchestra together in the room and having a video, I don’t know, for me its a dream come true. There is a lot of debate around this, I am sorry I cannot provide better answers at this point. Brass and percussion really dominate all microphones and it can be quite difficult to mix.\n* People will record in segments and glue together, I took integral recordings, I am an old school guy.\n* So in the end I’d say, try and learn everything you can, but don’t worry, these people are really pro and will play anything. I guess if you can find a colleague with more experience, that means a lot, and if anybody needs any help feel free to DM me. If there are any unanswered questions, just let me know.",

I have actually paid for it with my own money, and I have been around the industry (21 years active). Its just that I was waiting for the right opportunity and when we were setting up Retromagine one of the goals was that we wanted to try and do things we really really love (and I understand that this might be what many people will say, but then they will optimize for profit instead of love). It might not work out, but it was a calculated risk. Judging by some responses here, there are people who actually appreciate this.  Will they buy the game? I don't know, but ultimately I don't think that recording this orchestra will be either our downfall or our major success, but in my life, it is a highlight.  And honestly Id be super happy if some of our games can continue to have orchestral scores and that this can become a sort of a brand thing (the other big love is chip tunes). ",

          "text": "> Do you think that players even care?\n\nI think most players appreciate good music and most players value \"real\" music over AI generated. However, I think the average person could not tell the difference between music made with virtual instruments like [EastWest Symphonic Orchestra](https://www.soundsonline.com/orchestras/symphonic-orchestra) from music played by an actual orchestra, especially in the context of a video game where the music is just one of the many things they are taking in at a given moment. So, if they don't even realize the difference it's hard for that to translate to caring unless you actively educate them on it. And whether it's worth spending your limited marketing resources educating them that they should care that your music is a recording of a live performance will vary a lot by game/genre/audience.\n\n> Is music important enough to justify that level of work and budget?\n\nIt really depends on the game. Whether it's graphics, sound, audio, etc., one mistake I think a lot of people make is thinking that evaluating how good a piece of art is is the main thing you have to ask in order to decide if it enhances the game. Most commonly, this is the idea that photorealistic graphics are inherently a better fit. But this isn't true. Again, to use graphics as an example, not only might another art style (e.g. cartoon, pixel art, surrealist, abstract) fit better to a particular game, but the \"quality\" of graphics in the context of a game isn't just \"does it look great\" but things like \"does the player know where to look\", \"can the player find X\", \"does the player know what X is/means\", etc. So, it turns out that rather than evaluating art and then, because it's good, you decide it's an enhancement to add it to the game, I think for the best art, you need to start with the purpose of the game and use that to ask what the art needs to do in order to serve that purpose. And I think it's the same with everything, including music. You can't just say \"is this better music\" and then decide it's worth adding to the game because it's better music. You need to understand what the vision for the game is and then ask what the music needs to be like in order to help that vision come alive. In that sense, \"is music important enough to justify that level of work and budget\" isn't really a question that can be answered generically. I think the answer is sometimes yes and often no.\n\nIf a game is story driven and you want emotional engagement with the story, maybe the music serves to reinforce the particular emotion a player is supposed to be feeling at a moment. Meanwhile, in a game like Tetris Attack where you're rushing to make defensive and offensive combinations, the music intensifies when you're nearing death so that, even if you cannot see that you're near death, you can hear it and know to go on the defense. In another game, music might facilitate concentration. In another, music might help the player sync up with the rhythm of gameplay actions. Etc. So, I don't think there is some generic answer that investing money in live orchestra recordings of music is worth it. Different style and complexity of music makes sense for different games.\n\n> But to me, this is what being indie means. Doing what we love, not just what’s optimal for the P&L (within reason, of course).\n\nI think indies do benefit from being willing to make the \"less optimal for their P&L\" choices and thus find niches and untapped markets. I do wonder whether what you're doing actually achieves that. While not a lot of games are hiring a live orchestra, AAA studios are definitely producing human-made music to the quality level of your soundtrack. So, the actual differentiator here (you hiring an orchestra vs a AAA studio hiring a professional composer who records bits and samples others to make something that sounds just as good) might go unnoticed by many. But if it helps you stay motivated and helps you tell your story, then good for you.\n\n> And if anyone is considering recording with a live orchestra for their game, I’m happy to share logistics and real numbers. If there’s interest, I can also write up a detailed breakdown of the whole process.\n\nThat would be interesting, but I would imagine that unless the message is \"it's not as expensive as you think\", a lot of people would just be reading out of curiosity and not be positioned to actually do it.",

While I have written orchestra pieces before (using the East West Symphonic Orchestra virtual instrument I mentioned in my last comment), I'd think when you're writing for real humans rather than a digital instrument you need to pay a lot more attention to what is sane to play rather than just what sound result you want and that seems hard to know or keep track of with so many different instruments that each have their own quirks. \n\nWas there an iterative process with the musicians or composer where you made adjustments to fit the music and the humans playing it? Was there any iterative process where you refined the music as you heard them play it? How much time did they get between receiving your music and actually needing to perform it? Did you just luck out into writing music that was very playable and they just walked in and basically sight read it?",

Back then I thought: wow, that must be a whopper to pay. I mean, it ain't \"two carts of Marlboro\" cheap, that's for sure but it is affordable.\n\n  \nOf course, Vienna will cost more. But Budapest, Sofia, Skopje, cities where you might find great talent and get amazing results and not get ripped off. Though, disclaimer: I am not a sound expert. I can only make games, there are professionals out there with keen ear that can differentiate between \"really good symphony orchestra\" and \"really good assembly of samples\".\n\nAnd I guess it also depends on the game theme as well. For example, I am making a WWII inspired game: of course, my wishes are epic, heroic, historical, drama, symphony orchestra (right away). But wishes are one thing, reality always hits heavily. Though, 2k EUR for a masterpiece music like this (minus composing which you did yourself, great job there!) is not that much.\n\n  \nTrouble with me is that I get easily excited (that's what she said) so I would love to have an entire soundtrack, dozens of themes :D",

I can tell you that after I had the initial composition down as a draft, the \"polish\" and getting the score to look great took quite a bit of time.   \n  \nI think that now that I know how it works it will be much easier/faster. If I needed to write this now I'd say maybe a few days, maybe a week to get it from start to finish in terms of preparing the score, and then one day to record it, and one day for mix/master.  \n\nOf course when I say I know how this works, I mean I know the basics. The real mastery of composition and orchestration is a lifelong learning process. ",

You have a skill that few indie devs (if any) have.  You might literally be the only indie dev I've ever encountered with the skill of composing.   This is the single greatest limitation for any other indie dev wanting to follow in your tracks.  They'd have to hire a composer - pay the composer and presumably be able to hear the composers arrangement using tools - before committing to the IRL humans.\n\nI am a solodev ... I've got the cash to do what you're doing ... but I've no composer and very little time.\n\nSo, for me, AI is a godsend for what I'm doing.  I want to ask you an honest question.

That is why if you look at some of the Avengers trailers they are slightly different to the final film.\n\n\nBut as an indie developer, unless you are a known brand most people don't care about your game until it's actually released (or they can play a demo of it).",

The first couple of seconds are critical and it feels a bit slow, launch straight into the gameplay and make sure those cuts are sharp. \n\nMake sure to include at least 3/4 gifs of gameplay loops, no one reads these days so bright shiny gifs will help.\n\nI would suggest you try and increase the number of languages. If you can’t try and do a steam page in each different language it will get shown and people do understand if the game is in English even if they can’t understand it. But I would suggest trying to localise it.\n\nMake sure to get bundles with other games, this will be your sales tail. \n\nNaturally reach out to lots of streamers, you normally want to aim for 500-1000 emails, I know it’s a lot but it can really help with those wishlists.\n\nI notice you have controller support, make sure you do steam deck support too.",

Then I started nearing the end of development and realized my game dev Reddit account had to low karma to post anywhere even for advice my marketing skills were fine but not enough and I didn't have the money to make it do more. I ended up spending more time trying to market then working on my game of which I was spending 15 hours a day for months loving every second of development beforehand. That part was so fun the problem solving exciting the seeing an idea slowly forming something I never believed I could do made real was game changing. Then 3 hours of marketing a day was boring and burned me out in a couple of weeks. I need to get back into it from scratch make a few passion projects that show my skill and dedication and just build a small following off of that on like itch io and places like that.

We had big ambitions — a much larger ocean adventure inspired by One Piece.\n\nBut over time, things became difficult. Scope kept expanding, nothing solid was shipping, and the monthly burn rate was real. On top of that, health issues became a serious factor, and we eventually had to pause and step back.\n\nAfter that, I was alone again.\n\nThat’s when I went back to a small 1-week game jam prototype I had made before.\n\nInstead of asking “What world do I want to build?”\n\nI asked, “What can I realistically finish alone?”\n\nI love Raft, but 3D survival games make me motion sick.\n\nSo I removed movement.\n\nI turned the island into cards.\n\nI made decisions the core mechanic.\n\n\n\nCaptain Duck is basically the result of cutting scope until it was survivable — for both the player and for me.",

Imagine the stuff you’re driving past is invisible to us but is reflected off the car. It doesn’t have to be much and it’ll create a sense of speed and movement to the car that isn’t currently present (at least when watching from my phone).\n\nI’d also increase contrast between the lit parts of the trees/background and the unlit parts. This way we focus more on the car and the speed of things moving towards it. \n\nThe trees closer to the car could also catch more light while the trees further in the background are less affected. Again this increases depth. \n\nAlso none of this lighting makes much sense in the physical world, but if you make it consistent the brain will buy it and like it.\n\nIf I’m making no sense let me know.\n\nEdit:\nWanted to add I like what I see already!

You can add the sound of tires on gravel when you start moving. Add in the sound of stones getting kicked up against the underside of the van as you go faster. Add creaking of the suspension as it moves up and down. Maybe add a loud thump, when the suspension bottoms out. If both wheels bottom out, you can add the sound of metal on stones.

Give the camera some lag when accelerating and lead time to see in front of it like youre a passenger in the car feeling the movement, bouncing on every bump and vibrating down the rocky dirt road ever so slightly. Show the body of the car getting scraped away with sparks and make sure players hear that grating nails on a chalk board, clanking breaking sound you never wanna hear in a car. And the car looks like its a beater so give it a fun engine noise to clank along the path with. ;)",

          "text": "Your proto looks really promising.  You might want to take a look at an early ‘80’s coin op game, Moon Patrol, that IREM did and Williams distributed.  The game play centered on trading your need to get somewhere fast with seeing far enough ahead of you to react to obstacles in your path. \n\nWith respect to making the van pop, I think the windows feel kind of painted on at present. It pulls the van out of the scene. if you made the widows tinted, darker but translucent with a small alpha, you’d see through to a darkened background. That would attach the van more to the environment.  Guess you’d also need a silhouette of a driver, since you can see into and through the van, that could bounce as van goes over bumps, details that may seem small but have an big subliminal impact on believability and a positive  surprise factor when the player realizes the detail on repeated play.\nAny kind of junk loosely strapped to the roof that can bounce around would be fun too.\nThe headlight cone, as an element that illuminates  much of the road ahead on the right side of the screen, can be a key part of game play strategy. Making the headlight cone brighter would make it pop, too, especially if you darken the foreground/under-road region.  in fact, if the areas outside of the headlight beams darkened in a gradient to the edges of the screen, player would feel more like they were driving “too fast”, or outrunning their headlights on a dangerous unfamiliar road.  The concern that something is liable to pop out from the dark could influence your game play as well as adding a level of suspense.\nYou can use forward visibility vs velocity in game play as well as giving the scene a cinematic sense. If the van position to the right of center, were based on the van’s absolute velocity with acceleration adding to/subtracting from the van’s current X-coordinate on the screen.  The van would move closer/farther from frame right, sort of outrunning the camera, as it accelerates but letting the camera catch up as it decelerates.  When braking, the camera would first outrun the van so that the van slid left in frame as you braked, returning to screen center as the brakes are released. The reduction of the amount of viewable road in front of you as you accelerate, and as van velocity climbed, would make the player have to balance speed with desire to see farther ahead down the road.\nTrying to keep the engine from blowing could be another variable in both play and visuals",

I transferred an app(game) to a so-called publisher that ended up producing close to 0 results for the project, and then told me I needed to pay \"5-10k\" for them to transfer it back via steamworks.\n\nI worked on a game for more than 3 years when I got an email about a publishing offer.\n\nI had a video call in which the lead guy straight up told me to my face that he didn't think the game had any potential, but that they wanted to publish an unfinished game I had been working on previously. A huge red flag that I just didn't take seriously enough. I had been dealing with an unrelated hardship at the time, and I think it clouded my judgement here. I was desperate for help and just kind of went, \"What's the worst that can happen?\".\n\nSo I agreed to let them publish both games and they proceeded to 'run a marketing campaign'. I never really verified anything because I was overwhelmed dealing with something else (divorce, it was divorce).\n\nI did see wishlists go up, but it wasn't significant, and hard to know who to attribute them to because I was doing my own marketing effort. For all I know, their impact may have been 0.\n\nCommunication was sporadic, and ultimately unreliable. Chaotic, even.\n\nMy correspondent was either quitting, being replaced, or changing position within the company every week or two.\n\nLet me just say that I had launched a game before. Self-published. No real marketing.\n\nIt got about 23 reviews. It was my first game, and so that was a success for me.\n\nSkip forward to the release of this game, with the help of a \"publisher\", and... 4 reviews. Yeah. Yup, 4.\n\nIt's hard for anyone to foresee this, but they advised me to wait for a better release date, and while I waited, an indie game with a very similar name and theme launched. The \"what-ifs\" killed me for a while.\n\nA month went by and I heard nothing. I had to email them several times to get them to honor the first months payment. I was surprised when they actually did.\n\nTo work for more than 3 years on something and then to have to email and wait and wonder and email again and again before finally getting paid your scraps... yeah, I am never transferring an app to a publisher again.\n\nThe main guy assured me that they would send a revenue report at least once a month, then 4 months went by without a word from them. I decided I wouldn't be doing business with them and I wanted my game back. But of course, the guy refused, and said if I wanted it back I would have to buy it back for \"5-10k\".\n\nSo, I had Steam delist the game.\n\nThe name of the \"publisher\" is actually the most generic name possible: \"The Game Publisher\".\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nI am FlipswitchX on Twitch",

Its very important to make sure you really read and analyze a contract, mark notes and things you want removed, and then have meeting to discuss the notes and demand the removal of the clauses you don't want. It sounds like you fell victim to a \"capable sales person\" and it sucks. There's a good chance there's no legal recourse for you, and unless the contract says otherwise there's no legal path for them to pursue you. So the best option might be to grieve your project and move on armed with this knowledge in the future. It can happen to anyone, and there's a reason these publishers target rookies.

Even if the pub is solid and will sell thousands of copies for you, if they keep billing you for various \"services\", you will still make little to no money.\n3. Make sure that even if you signed a shit contract, they can enforce it. E.g. if you are in the EU and some murican pub made a contract that just screws you (there is no parity between their obligations and entitlements), ignore the contract and if they threaten, invite them to sue you - they won't, and if they do, contracts like that don't fly and you would win.\nSorry for you, but before paying anything, make sure you get a lawyer take a look at what you signed.

You should take care of them and even if it means slowly building, it is way better than being dependant to someone else..",
