So the first boss is a big H for hydrogen and the next boss is a big H with a little curly e tail. And the next is a big L holding a magic rod with an energy ball (the letter \"i\") for Lithium. Each level is named after that element number. You collect all the elements and you'll be able to craft chemicals/alloys to modify your stats (that feature is still a work in progress). \n\nYeah, I have the Kickstarter here: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/starrune/star-rune](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/starrune/star-rune)\n\nAnd you can also join the Discord!

The game can mostly be thought of as 2 parts: \"paths\" and \"battlezones\". For the paths, it's mostly all linear; just like a typing test. But for the battle zones, you battle against mini-bosses called Glitchborn which cannot be typed. Instead you use the Azki (the letters) to form dash attacks to destroy them. You can also hurt them with a jump/spin slash and a meteor attack, as well as your ultimate (which you cast with \\[enter\\] when you have full charge). \n\nThe funnest part of the game is getting create with the battle zones to see just how fast you can desetroy the mini-bosses. There's all sorts of little micro-decisions and interesting choices to make. Do I use my ultimate? Can I finish him off faster by going here and there and there? should i use the spin slash or dash lines for this part? etc...",

It’s brutal to say, but it’s true. This time is usually very short, around 2-3 seconds, which means that your game has to make an impression within that time frame. Therefore, aesthetic is indeed critical.\n\nHowever, a soulless game can be the most beautiful piece of art around, but with “only” aesthetic, it will remain just that: a beautiful, soulless game. I agree that the style could definitely be improved, but when I watched the short clip, I didn’t focus on it. Rather, I focused on the core gameplay idea. To me, this means that your gameplay speaks so loudly that puts other aspects in the background, so to speak. That’s why I stopped to write a comment!",

But I think it was important to not use a lot of pre-made asset packs because they add too much detail which distracted from the letter recognition. And having contrast between the letters and the background is also super important. Because #1 is readability. So I think I found just the right amount of detail (roughly). Still, I think with the right artist, it can go even further haha\n\nAnd yes I do!

The other parts of of the game are mostly linear but in the battlezones, you get to choose which letters to dash to, and it makes for some crazy battles and battles that are really unique to typing, as you have way more options at your fingers than game controllers have; so it gives you this real cool control that is really unlike any other game. \n\nI hope you'll check out the kickstarter and/or join the discord!! :D",

I changed it to something else... the name slips my mind right now lol.. it started out as an asteroids tutorial project that I added typing game mechanics to. Then I changed the asteroids ship to a star by drawing a couple extra lines, and then I settled on Star Rune for the name.\n\nI was very tempted to make a typing pun and include words that were good for SEO like \"Typing\" or \"Keyboard\" or \"Keys\" etc... but that felt a little soulless (and way too cliche) to me.\n\nBut Runes are glyphs / symbols. And since the enemies are glyphs / symbols and it's a typing game, I thought it was a cool combo. It also hints at magic and fantasy elements, which I like.\n\nStar Rune might be a simple name, but so is Dragon Ball. Or Star Wars. Or Star Fox... etc...\n\nBut I'm open to appending something onto it.. like how Zelda is \"The Legend of Zelda\" not just Zelda.. and now it's like \"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom\".\n\nI could do something like that... \"The Legend of Star Rune : The Last Star\" or something haha.\n\nWhat do you think?",

I've actually have been designing a lot of the game based on how fun it will be to commentate on like a sports commentator during gameplay / a big tournament or competition. \n\nThe game has sections where it's just pure typing speed. But there are other parts where there are little micro-choices. The best example is during the combat system in battle zones, where you get to choose which letters you want to dash to. Using a letter too early might slow you down because you can only use each letter once; new letters will spawn in but you have to wait a little bit for them to spawn back in. There are many decisions like \"Will I use my ultimate attack here or will i save it for the next battle\". Or do i want to try to finish this mini boss off by spin slashing him or should i dash to that  letter over there? etc...\n\nThose little tiny decisions are what make it fun and will make it especially fun to commentate on in a competitive environment.

Maybe it is a reasonable price, but for me personally, I wouldn't pay up to 29 for a typing game since you just type. Since it's on Kickstarter, the price is likely to change and doesn't reflect the main price, and for a high-quality game such as this, I'd pay mostly 15–20 USD. That's like, for the Steam full release, I mean. That's just my personal opinion, as a person that plays a large variety of games, not mainly typing games. I take a look at another game, like idk Arc Raiders, and if I save a little more, I could just buy that. But as I said, just my personal opinion! I do hope your game ends up succeeding, as it looks very fun.",

That's your golden standard for 'moneys worth'.\n\nSo, if you pay 6 bucks and it lasted you an hour, you've had your moneys worth. No refund. You pay 12 bucks and you played it 2 hours, No refund. You paid 18 bucks and find it not to your taste after 2 hours? Refund. See how that works?\n\nThis should deter devs from selling overpriced slop, and also deters people from blowing through cheap games quick enough to refund them.\n\nBottom line is that time is money.",

Perfect example of endearing but simple stick figure art. You don’t need anything fancy. \n\nIf you publish this game and are not forthcoming about it being AI art, you are being deceitful. If you are forthcoming about AI art, you are going to get crucified. But even worse, if you are NOT forthcoming about it AND it becomes known, your wife will likely not be able to overcome this reputation. It’s only going to hurt you both in the end. \n\nI highly encourage her to delay the full release of the game in order to replace the AI art with art from a real person, whether it’s her own or someone else she commissions.",

I love the visual style that is a combination of realism but with warm stylised colours.\n\nThe only thing is that the red dress at 0:06 looks untextured before the floral pattern gets applied and cloth physics kick in. I imagine the material is correct for the fabric it is meant to represent but the lighting isn't realistic so the material looks flat. The stack of finished dresses on the other hand makes me want to bury my face in them.\n\nIf I wanted to start a family and live on a farm with wildflowers and play a job simulator in the off hours, this would be the one. I'm not, so I won't buy the game, but you absolutely need to blast this at every cosy/job simulator streamer. We live in an age where the most likely path to success is making a meme game and hoping it goes viral, but surely there are still many people who just want to play a good game in a familiar genre?",

As far as simulator games go, this one looks pretty well done. Realistically I would say finding 100,000 people that want to buy and play a tailor simulator could prove to be challenging but if the game is fun enough/received well then ya got a chance! \n\nNice work and best of luck!",

(And maybe update the shop name in the vids)\n\nI would say this type of game is perfect for regular small content updates, either bigger monetized packs or smaller (and possibly more frequent) non-monetized packs, which would keep the player base engaged and would result in more organic traffic, and therefore more sales... but don't listen to me, I'm not a marketing guy so might be talking outta my ass here. But that's what I personally would aim at.",

Reach out to a lot of non-traditional channels and consider places that people who love fashion might be. Advertise in fashion magazines. In cosplay howto magazines. Find forums of people who love dress-up. You might want to hire someone whose job it is to find and engage with these people.\n\nPotentially you could reach out to people with their own fashion following and ask for their advice on where to find similar people. \n\nExtra content could be related to demographics of fashion, such as running a cosplay store, or working behind the scenes on runway shows.\n\nGood luck!",

Especially the \"3D fashion without mtx\" angle, I know people mention it sometimes. Just make sure to read the sidebar rules as I think devs can only post promo posts once a week or something like that.\n\nI'll be honest though: even if it's a game that people would be all over, Early Access has an incredibly bad rep in the cozy gaming community. People have been burnt over by too many \"abandoned\" projects, etc. So that might also explain the lacklustre sales despite the obvious quality of the game. (And the fact that you can throw rolls of fabric to people's head which, having worked in retail, I relate to a lot). \n\nI would definitely continue on improving the game and try to launch a very solid, bug-free, content-full Full Release and have a big push of marketing around that.",

I ended up getting a bunch of private messages of some bots and scammers (I remember 2 different \"people\" sent me the exact same portfolio).\n\nIt got overwhelming looking at so many portfolios and not finding one that made me go like \"IT'S THIS ONE\".\n\nThen one I saw someone post something about their game and saw their capsule image was very very cute and it had the vibes/style I was looking for. I asked if they could share the artist, which they did, and when I saw her portfolio... it made me go like \"IT'S THIS ONE\".\n\nSuper happy with my choice and it was a pleasure to work with my artist.\n\nSo, my advice is, take your time to pick one that you believe can bring your imagination to life. Definitely do not rush things and take your time to give constructive feedback on things you really want your artist to understand/see.\n\nHope this helps. Best of luck!",

For the dog, I sent photos of my real life dog and the sprite of the dog in game for her to draw a dog based on those references. When she sent me the first sketch of the whole thing, I immediately told her to keep that dog design. \n\nRegarding the player character, it took quite a bit of time to get it to feel right. I was gonna post here some progress sketches last night but forgot. \n\nBasically, I sent her the sprite of my character, and I did 2 or 3 sketches of how I would want the player to look like close-up, and in what pose I wanted it. \n\nHere's the first few sketches my artist sent me:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/MWl20bt\n\nI then proceeded to give some feedback on many details, I did more sketches of little changes I wanted done, then she delivered more updated sketches, then I gave more feedback, then more sketches, and then we reached the sketch that I decided was final:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/BKEVjFL\n\nAfter that, it was linework, colour, shading, highlighs and other details and done.\n\nHope this answers your question!",

I didn't have any plans for the game, I was programming and drawing stuff.

I ended up getting a bunch of private messages of some bots and scammers (I remember 2 different \"people\" sent me the exact same portfolio). \n\nIt got overwhelming looking at so many portfolios and not finding one that made me go like \"IT'S THIS ONE\". \n\nThen one I saw someone post something about their game and saw their capsule image was very very cute and it had the vibes/style I was looking for. I asked if they could share the artist, which they did, and when I saw her portfolio... it made me go like \"IT'S THIS ONE\". \n\nSuper happy with my choice and it was a pleasure to work with my artist.\n\nSo, my advice is, take your time to pick one that you believe can bring your imagination to life. Definitely do not rush things and take your time to give constructive feedback on things you really want your artist to understand/see.\n\nHope this helps. Best of luck!",

Copying and pasting here my comment that answers your question:\n\nI actually had made one or two over at /r/gameDevClassifieds requesting people to send me their portfolios. I ended up getting a bunch of private messages of some bots and scammers (I remember 2 different \"people\" sent me the exact same portfolio).\n\nIt got overwhelming looking at so many portfolios and not finding one that made me go like \"IT'S THIS ONE\".\n\nThen one I saw someone post something about their game and saw their capsule image was very very cute and it had the vibes/style I was looking for. I asked if they could share the artist, which they did, and when I saw her portfolio... it made me go like \"IT'S THIS ONE\".\n\nSuper happy with my choice and it was a pleasure to work with my artist.\n\nSo, my advice is, take your time to pick one that you believe can bring your imagination to life. Definitely do not rush things and take your time to give constructive feedback on things you really want your artist to understand/see.\n\nHope this helps. Best of luck!",

There's more recommendation going around that your keyart should better reflect the actual look and feel of your title. Take RoadWarden as an example, it's got some beautiful keyart, AND it reflects the style of the game in a way that's more authentic to what you'll actually experience as a player. \n\nUltimately the choice is yours, and it is *really* beautiful art, but just the sentiment I've taken notice of recently.",

Making small projects in an array of different genres because you never know when a company might segue to that, but to put what you were most passionate about in the beginning of your portfolio to emphasize the quality of the work you produce when working in genres you were most in love with. But then showing other genres towards the end to show you have the ability to be adaptable. \n\nAlso small slices, not full big games but something similar to what we see now in game jams or demos to show a basic mechanical understanding of an engaging enough gameplay loop. And with that passion and demonstration of technical understanding, its a good way to get an in and then work your way in the system towards areas you would be most comfortable in, specially on the art side of things as well.",

Post on social media often. Have a Discord where you announce updates, show sneak peeks, and more. Also, Reddit is a good place to post because you can actually talk with the community. More on that later.\n\n3. Talk to the community. Like I said before, you can get feedback and stuff from your social medias(Reddit and Discord in this case), so you know what your players want and how to attract more players and stuff. You can also convince new people to play your game by showing that gameplay footage.\n\nI am by no means a professional, but these tricks have worked for other people that I've seen so try these if you haven't already.

Don’t bother reaching out with a “cool idea” only. Yes publishers take a pretty heavy cut. They’re best for funding (which you have to pay back before you see a dime) and localisation. The only way they really help with marketing is by adding your game to their back catalog, meaning people who play their other games are more likely to see/buy your game too.",

The biggest spike pre prelease was a Youtbue video by Majuular, gave us around 5k in a week, after relase it was new and trending tab, gave us around 50-60k wishlist in a week  \n4. yes, I think you need to try to reach A LOT, of course not all will talk back to you, usually like 3-5% at most but it's the biggest source of exposure  \n5. Reddit/Tiktok/X, reddit seems to worked the best for the game, there was some paid meida but for really samll ammounty of money and they didnt really add a lot  \n6.

But when they say “yes, yes” and then take eight months to fix a translation error (which was annoying, because the effect didn't match what was written), or when they release DLC featuring their characters at the beach while the base game (a Fire Emblem-like game) is full of bugs... That's when I feel like I'm wasting my time and they deserve a bad rating.\n\nNow, as a developer, I'm lucky to have players who take the time to report bugs when they encounter them. Why? Probably because they encounter bugs after several hours of play. Not right from the start, nor all the time. And it makes a big difference between encountering a bug (major or minor) after enjoying the game or right from the start and in abundance.\n\nSure, there are players who go overboard, like everywhere else.

          "text": "I think this is a blurrier line than people admit. Even large studios with full QA teams and significant budgets still ship games with bugs. So expecting indie developers - who often don’t have dedicated testers - to release perfectly polished games feels unrealistic. That said, I do think we’re seeing this problem more often than we should.\n\nBugs absolutely matter. Players paid for the game and they’re entitled to a functional experience. But it’s also true that no developer can catch everything before launch. Where I think the bigger issue lies is in how expectations shift depending on the business model.\n\nWith free-to-play games, players are often far more forgiving of bugs because “it’s free”. Yet many of those same players have spent money on microtransactions. They’ve invested financially but still give the game a pass. I’ve seen this happen a lot. As a result, we end up with a market flooded by “free” games that are low quality but financially successful, while smaller paid titles are scrutinised much more harshly.\n\nPart of the problem is that review systems don’t clearly distinguish between “this game is fundamentally bad” and “this game has a fixable bug”. If platforms like Steam added a bug reporting feature that was just as visible and easy to use as the review button - maybe even right next to it - we’d likely see fewer reactionary negative reviews. Ideally, bug reports could even be reflected separately in a game’s profile, such as showing:  \n  \nUser Review: Positive  \nCurrent Stability - Minor issues reported\n\nOr something to that effect, so players have context without tanking the overall rating.\n\nThat kind of system could encourage constructive feedback instead of punishment and better support developers who are genuinely trying to improve their games. I also think it would help if players who report a bug that later gets fixed received some small reward as recognition for contributing. It could be something simple - a badge or whatever. But it would frame bug reporting as a positive community effort rather than something that just drags down an otherwise enjoyable game.\n\nI think leaving a review should involve a bit more scrutiny. If someone is going to post a negative review about a specific issue, they should have to go through a simple process to clarify what the actual problem is. It doesn’t seem right that someone can leave a review that just says “Couldn’t play the game” with no context. That could mean anything - a bug, unsupported hardware or something as simple as not having a mouse and keyboard.\n\nIf reviews had some basic structure - for example requiring the reviewer to select categories like performance, controls, crashes or compatibility - it would make the feedback more useful for both developers and players. It would also help separate genuine technical issues from personal setup problems, rather than letting vague one-line complaints disproportionately affect a game’s rating.\n\nI think even a star rating system would be useful, specifically one that breaks reviews down into core components of a game such as stability and performance, controls, responsiveness, gameplay, mechanics, story, writing, graphics etc.\n\nI just think a thumbs up and a thumbs down is just too basic of a rating system for something so complex, especially where serious time and money is involved.  But that's just me.",

My style is more cute and colorful and might not match with your needs. but if you really like the current logo but just wished it wasn't AI, my advice would be to have another artist give it a human touch by just tracing over it and fixing the weird perspectives, digital artifacts and fix it so its it all feels like a coherent image and not a bunch of large creatures standing over a burning city. That's likely what I would do if I were asked but I'm sure a better artist could provide you a better piece. I would just search and make sure that the artist disclaims that they're against AI art. Many are, so I'd think there would be a market unless this person scammed you by masquerading as a \"no AI\" artist. \n\nOther than that, I don't really have any personal recommendations unfortunately. \n\n",

It looks like three lanyards held to the main piece with rivets...?\n\n\nThe fact that the details of all the aforementioned parts kind of just seem to blend and melt into each other is usually a big tell for me.

          "text": "Here's some tips for commissioning art:\n\n1) Usually, an artist will have specifics for how much things will cost based on effort. For example: line art vs full color vs full color + shading. If someone offering commissions just offers a price without asking specifics and there isn't a pre-negotiated deal (things the artist has already offered usually, like a Your Character Here or an Adoptable) you're probably not dealing with an artist.\n\n2) Most artists usually wait for you to come to them rather than the other way around. This isn't always the case, but usually they post commission details on their socials and then wait for people to contact them. So, it's good to be wary about someone coming to you for a commission. An AI grifter can't do the social media post method because they'd get laughed off of the platform for being AI.\n\n3) It's always a good idea to look at previous works of an artist before commissioning them. This is usually fairly easy to do once you have their username as most artists will post their work online. If someone has no online gallery, that's a red flag, but not guaranteed to be a grifter.\n\n4) When you do get sample art from the commissioned artist, reverse Google search them. If you can find those pieces from clearly different artists, that means the person is probably lying about it being theirs and have stolen them to manipulate you into commissioning them. I'm in a circle of twitch-streamer friends and it's fairly common for someone to offer to do your twitch graphics and show you samples of other people's work.\n\nHope this helps!",

The windows, rooftops, and the oddness of where the stack of houses begin where the brick castle wall ends. I find AI does a lot of impossible repetitiveness of shapes, and while it's a bit more subtle here, it's still odd architecture.\n* The crow has a sort of strange appendage behind its righthand claw. Not sure if this is supposed to be a tail feather or  if it's an error, repeating the claw shape? \n* The clouds and sky have a lot of repetition in them - though as someone who uses hand-made stamp brushes (where you hand-draw something and turn it into a repetitive stamp brush), I...wouldn't necessarily mind this, if they'd blended different parts out. \n* Lastly, some of the line work on the figures is off: the center buckle where the straps crisscross on the giant's chest looks a bit melty. And some of the outerlining on each figure stops at points where it doesn't quite make sense. I don't mind imperfections in hand drawn art, but these more look like unfinished renderings.\n\n  \nYou could try to ask this person for edits, but it might be best to get a real artist to either correct or just redo this entirely. The redo would obviously be more expensive, and if you've already sunk money into this, then obviously that's up to your budget. \n\nAs someone who has done cover work for authors and game-related art, I give clients tons of sketches upfront and lots of updates as I go along. Make sure you stipulate how many sketches/status updates you want to see of the process. Most artists are already doing this when creating any piece and it shouldn't be too big of an ask. ",

If you actually look at the linework, it’s consistent and deliberate—not that weird, melted-plastic look you get with generative models.\n\nHere’s why this is obviously hand-painted:\n\nAnatomy and Proportion: Notice the giant’s hands and the raven’s talons. AI consistently struggles with complex articulation, but here the grip and the tension in the knuckles are anatomically perfect. The weight of the fur mantle also sits naturally on the shoulders, showing an understanding of physics that a prompt-box just doesn't have.\n\nThe Architecture: Look at the village below. The windows aren't melting into the walls, and the shingles on the rooftops follow a logical, perspective-accurate grid. AI usually hallucinates those details into a blurry mess, but these are sharp, distinct assets.\n\nCompositional Intent: The way the smoke leads your eye from the burning village up to the raven is a classic professional design choice. It’s a \"Z-pattern\" layout meant to guide the viewer’s gaze.\n\nThe Text: The \"GIANTFALL\" logo is perfectly integrated with a custom texture overlay. AI text still looks like a fever dream most of the time, and it certainly wouldn't handle the kerning and distressed \"chalk\" effect this cleanly.\n\nIt’s getting exhausting that \"good digital art\" now automatically means \"AI\" to some people. This is just high-quality 2D digital illustration. Give the artist some credit.\n\nWould you like me to help you draft a more formal breakdown of these artistic techniques for a different platform?",

And it is even the best tool to use in some cases.\n\nIf a developer does not have the personal skills, time, or money to complete an aspect of their game, and the choice is between using AI to complete the game or not using AI to complete the game, then using AI is the only correct solution for the developer.\n\nZealots are absolutists, usually hiding behind a defense based on a false quality or false morality argument. They don't think things ALL the way through. Sometimes, they don't even think things halfway through.\n\nThere are MANY evil humans. But that doesn't mean that ALL humans are evil. And it certainly doesn't mean that ALL humans should be wiped out. The same is true for AI. There are some bad uses for it, but not all of them are bad.\n\nAI makes better art than I can. AI recognizes patterns better than I can. A calculator does better math than I can. A translator understands other languages better than I can. AI understands code better than I do. But who is creating a game? I am... because AI cannot do what I can do. I know what I want. I know how to put things together. I know when something works right and when it doesn't.\n\nHave I touched AI for my games (other than asking it math questions)? No. But I would not have an issue in doing so if I believe it is needed. Why? Because it is a tool. I've read many arguments against AI, but not a single one has convinced me that I shouldn't. They really are not solid arguments... they are always lacking in one way or another, completely counterable.\n\nAI itself is not good or bad, but the method or intent of use. There are some uses that are absolutely evil. But there are some uses that are absolutely good. Just be good. Just do good. Whatever you do, do it in a positive, beneficial way. Be constructive, not destructive. I wish people would not be zealots.",

It's whether a game *exists* or not. \n\nIsn't it a good thing for someone to be able to break out of the corporate grind by creating and selling a work of art? Isn't it a good thing that people are able to put their creative ideas into existence, where previously they simply wouldn't have been able to? \n\nAnything overly sloppy is going to fail purely by the mechanics of the market. Using AI to create anything of worth is just not possible without a thorough guiding human hand. I'm a corporate web dev, and in my day job, I use AI all the time. But that tech is nowhere close to making me obsolete - I work on large, complex projects, and AI just gets so much stuff wrong.

If your game is completely free and/or you’re in a prototyping phase, then yeah that’s fine. \n\nProfiting off of content that is AI generated instead of assisted(such as a tool like Google is), is 100% not okay as it is stealing from artists that aren’t getting a penny for their work. Why should you profit off of their work and not them?\n\nDo not be surprised or offended if you ignore this and people get upset. Either own it or don’t use it. Don’t push the narrative that it’s okay just to make yourself feel better.\n\nAs someone who has recently replaced all of their AI assets with their own art(I was using it temporarily while prototyping systems), even though it’s nowhere near final I can tell you it feels AWESOME to be able to completely claim it as my own work.",

Some people may not even be aware of the fact that the art they got back was AI-generated or AI-assisted. Without taking an absolutist stance like \"no AI ever\" or \"all AI okay\", I don't think there's a very clear line between what is acceptable and what's not.\n\nI would rather AI users be allowed to post, but instead of telling them \"this is AI and AI is bad\", we can talk about the real issues in their games that stem from the use of AI with the intent of encouraging people to want to surpass the machine.

              "text": "Majority of people against AI are for one of three reasons:\n\n1) AI art - majority of AI models were trained on art without giving credit or compensation to the artists, and without asking for their permission. Many people hate the use of AI art because of this. Another side of why some people hate AI art is that people want AI that can prep their taxes and do math for them, so they can focus on things they like, such as art. They don't want an AI that can do the fun things (art), so they can focus on their job more. AI creating art while people are stuck doing monotonous things seems backwards to many people.\n\n2) AI slop - a lot of people think AI produces shit work. Now, this is true, but the amount it's improved in just a few years is astonishing. I use it daily to form SQL statements so I don't have to waste \\~10 trying to piece together my data. I trained a chatgpt instance a single time, and I go to that instance every time I want to ask a question about my database, and it remembers how all the pieces connect and spits my out my statement in a few seconds. It is rarely wrong when it comes to something simple like that and it saves me a couple hours a week.\n\n3) AI vaccuum - research is already showing loss of critical thinking & creativity skills because AI can do it for us. Why even bother googling something and trying to find an article to see what something is talking about when I can prompt AI, read what it says, and go on with my day? I remember in one of my first \"big boy\" jobs I spent almost an entire week designing and implementing a complex spreadsheet filled with VBA macros that helped a CPA firm take their invoicing process paperless. I had to dive into Excel macros the other day again, and I was able to whip up a pretty complex spreadsheet in an hour. I just told the AI what I wanted to do, how my data was displayed, and then had to tweak a bit. I used none of my programming or design skills. No critical thinking at all. How long until we're riding around on floating chairs, unable to walk because our bones are too fragile, drinking muffin-in-a-cups every day?",
