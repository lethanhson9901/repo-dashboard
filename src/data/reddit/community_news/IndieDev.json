So the first boss is a big H for hydrogen and the next boss is a big H with a little curly e tail. And the next is a big L holding a magic rod with an energy ball (the letter \"i\") for Lithium. Each level is named after that element number. You collect all the elements and you'll be able to craft chemicals/alloys to modify your stats (that feature is still a work in progress). \n\nYeah, I have the Kickstarter here: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/starrune/star-rune](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/starrune/star-rune)\n\nAnd you can also join the Discord!

But for the battle zones, you battle against mini-bosses called Glitchborn which cannot be typed. Instead you use the Azki (the letters) to form dash attacks to destroy them. You can also hurt them with a jump/spin slash and a meteor attack, as well as your ultimate (which you cast with \\[enter\\] when you have full charge). \n\nThe funnest part of the game is getting create with the battle zones to see just how fast you can desetroy the mini-bosses. There's all sorts of little micro-decisions and interesting choices to make. Do I use my ultimate? Can I finish him off faster by going here and there and there? should i use the spin slash or dash lines for this part? etc...",

I've put my heart & soul into this for the last 3 years. I keep hearing people say \"focus on aesthetics, don't re-invent the wheel with game mechanics\" but I really wanted to reinvent the wheel I guess lol\n\nThanks again!

It’s brutal to say, but it’s true. This time is usually very short, around 2-3 seconds, which means that your game has to make an impression within that time frame. Therefore, aesthetic is indeed critical.\n\nHowever, a soulless game can be the most beautiful piece of art around, but with “only” aesthetic, it will remain just that: a beautiful, soulless game. I agree that the style could definitely be improved, but when I watched the short clip, I didn’t focus on it. Rather, I focused on the core gameplay idea. To me, this means that your gameplay speaks so loudly that puts other aspects in the background, so to speak. That’s why I stopped to write a comment!",

But I think it was important to not use a lot of pre-made asset packs because they add too much detail which distracted from the letter recognition. And having contrast between the letters and the background is also super important. Because #1 is readability. So I think I found just the right amount of detail (roughly). Still, I think with the right artist, it can go even further haha\n\nAnd yes I do!

The other parts of of the game are mostly linear but in the battlezones, you get to choose which letters to dash to, and it makes for some crazy battles and battles that are really unique to typing, as you have way more options at your fingers than game controllers have; so it gives you this real cool control that is really unlike any other game. \n\nI hope you'll check out the kickstarter and/or join the discord!! :D",

I changed it to something else... the name slips my mind right now lol.. it started out as an asteroids tutorial project that I added typing game mechanics to. Then I changed the asteroids ship to a star by drawing a couple extra lines, and then I settled on Star Rune for the name.\n\nI was very tempted to make a typing pun and include words that were good for SEO like \"Typing\" or \"Keyboard\" or \"Keys\" etc... but that felt a little soulless (and way too cliche) to me.\n\nBut Runes are glyphs / symbols. And since the enemies are glyphs / symbols and it's a typing game, I thought it was a cool combo. It also hints at magic and fantasy elements, which I like.\n\nStar Rune might be a simple name, but so is Dragon Ball. Or Star Wars. Or Star Fox... etc...\n\nBut I'm open to appending something onto it.. like how Zelda is \"The Legend of Zelda\" not just Zelda.. and now it's like \"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom\".\n\nI could do something like that... \"The Legend of Star Rune : The Last Star\" or something haha.\n\nWhat do you think?",

Maybe it is a reasonable price, but for me personally, I wouldn't pay up to 29 for a typing game since you just type. Since it's on Kickstarter, the price is likely to change and doesn't reflect the main price, and for a high-quality game such as this, I'd pay mostly 15–20 USD. That's like, for the Steam full release, I mean. That's just my personal opinion, as a person that plays a large variety of games, not mainly typing games. I take a look at another game, like idk Arc Raiders, and if I save a little more, I could just buy that. But as I said, just my personal opinion! I do hope your game ends up succeeding, as it looks very fun.",

Hear me out.\n\nLets take what you'd normally expect from a AAA game; at least 10 hours for 60 bucks. So 60 bucks divided by 10 hours is 6 bucks an hour. That's your golden standard for 'moneys worth'.\n\nSo, if you pay 6 bucks and it lasted you an hour, you've had your moneys worth. No refund. You pay 12 bucks and you played it 2 hours, No refund. You paid 18 bucks and find it not to your taste after 2 hours? Refund. See how that works?\n\nThis should deter devs from selling overpriced slop, and also deters people from blowing through cheap games quick enough to refund them.\n\nBottom line is that time is money.",

I love the visual style that is a combination of realism but with warm stylised colours.\n\nThe only thing is that the red dress at 0:06 looks untextured before the floral pattern gets applied and cloth physics kick in. I imagine the material is correct for the fabric it is meant to represent but the lighting isn't realistic so the material looks flat. The stack of finished dresses on the other hand makes me want to bury my face in them.\n\nIf I wanted to start a family and live on a farm with wildflowers and play a job simulator in the off hours, this would be the one. I'm not, so I won't buy the game, but you absolutely need to blast this at every cosy/job simulator streamer. We live in an age where the most likely path to success is making a meme game and hoping it goes viral, but surely there are still many people who just want to play a good game in a familiar genre?",

Reach out to a lot of non-traditional channels and consider places that people who love fashion might be. Advertise in fashion magazines. In cosplay howto magazines. Find forums of people who love dress-up. You might want to hire someone whose job it is to find and engage with these people.\n\nPotentially you could reach out to people with their own fashion following and ask for their advice on where to find similar people. \n\nExtra content could be related to demographics of fashion, such as running a cosplay store, or working behind the scenes on runway shows.\n\nGood luck!",

Just make sure to read the sidebar rules as I think devs can only post promo posts once a week or something like that.\n\nI'll be honest though: even if it's a game that people would be all over, Early Access has an incredibly bad rep in the cozy gaming community. People have been burnt over by too many \"abandoned\" projects, etc. So that might also explain the lacklustre sales despite the obvious quality of the game. (And the fact that you can throw rolls of fabric to people's head which, having worked in retail, I relate to a lot). \n\nI would definitely continue on improving the game and try to launch a very solid, bug-free, content-full Full Release and have a big push of marketing around that.",

I ended up getting a bunch of private messages of some bots and scammers (I remember 2 different \"people\" sent me the exact same portfolio).\n\nIt got overwhelming looking at so many portfolios and not finding one that made me go like \"IT'S THIS ONE\".\n\nThen one I saw someone post something about their game and saw their capsule image was very very cute and it had the vibes/style I was looking for. I asked if they could share the artist, which they did, and when I saw her portfolio... it made me go like \"IT'S THIS ONE\".\n\nSuper happy with my choice and it was a pleasure to work with my artist.\n\nSo, my advice is, take your time to pick one that you believe can bring your imagination to life. Definitely do not rush things and take your time to give constructive feedback on things you really want your artist to understand/see.\n\nHope this helps. Best of luck!",

When she sent me the first sketch of the whole thing, I immediately told her to keep that dog design. \n\nRegarding the player character, it took quite a bit of time to get it to feel right. I was gonna post here some progress sketches last night but forgot. \n\nBasically, I sent her the sprite of my character, and I did 2 or 3 sketches of how I would want the player to look like close-up, and in what pose I wanted it. \n\nHere's the first few sketches my artist sent me:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/MWl20bt\n\nI then proceeded to give some feedback on many details, I did more sketches of little changes I wanted done, then she delivered more updated sketches, then I gave more feedback, then more sketches, and then we reached the sketch that I decided was final:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/BKEVjFL\n\nAfter that, it was linework, colour, shading, highlighs and other details and done.\n\nHope this answers your question!",

I know people are tired of this type of stuff, but this game was born from the pain of losing my real life dog to poison 2 years ago. \n\nI was working on a different project before, but I couldn't put my mind to focus on it, so I started a new project with the main goal of keeping my head busy. I didn't have any plans for the game, I was programming and drawing stuff. Then one day I realized I wanted to do something in honor of my dog, and the game became about him. \n\nIn the game, you just have to collect wishbones that will grant you a heartfelt but selfish wish in the end. Since the game can be completed in 15 to 30 minutes, I might just release it for free.",

There's more recommendation going around that your keyart should better reflect the actual look and feel of your title. Take RoadWarden as an example, it's got some beautiful keyart, AND it reflects the style of the game in a way that's more authentic to what you'll actually experience as a player. \n\nUltimately the choice is yours, and it is *really* beautiful art, but just the sentiment I've taken notice of recently.",

Making small projects in an array of different genres because you never know when a company might segue to that, but to put what you were most passionate about in the beginning of your portfolio to emphasize the quality of the work you produce when working in genres you were most in love with. But then showing other genres towards the end to show you have the ability to be adaptable. \n\nAlso small slices, not full big games but something similar to what we see now in game jams or demos to show a basic mechanical understanding of an engaging enough gameplay loop. And with that passion and demonstration of technical understanding, its a good way to get an in and then work your way in the system towards areas you would be most comfortable in, specially on the art side of things as well.",

Post on social media often. Have a Discord where you announce updates, show sneak peeks, and more. Also, Reddit is a good place to post because you can actually talk with the community. More on that later.\n\n3. Talk to the community. Like I said before, you can get feedback and stuff from your social medias(Reddit and Discord in this case), so you know what your players want and how to attract more players and stuff. You can also convince new people to play your game by showing that gameplay footage.\n\nI am by no means a professional, but these tricks have worked for other people that I've seen so try these if you haven't already.

Beyond that, multiple instances of the same character are consistent with each other, which indicates the title text is not AI generated.\n\n> Windmills look strange, not 3 way symmetrical, and both windmills have identical orientation\n\nThe windmills on the mountain have perspective, one is cast in partial shadow and the other is completely shadowed by the nearby hill. They look pretty symmetrical to me given the skewed perspective, especially within reason that a human drew this.\n\n>group of 3 farm factory things look identical\n\nAgain from the first text point discussed, making identical things in a picture is something that AI is notoriously bad at doing, whereas when you have multiple elements like that, a human is so much more likely to just copy and paste instead of making inconsistent variants that don't match in details.",

Maybe the old one was the one you actually were originally using, but the new one is also AI generated but I guess visually more appealing...\n\nSo you put that together and posted here. Then to drive up the engagement, you've been responding with \"Okay!\" and \"Ok I see\", nonsense filler replies to a lot of people's genuine comments, because you're under the false impression that by doing this, you're driving up engagement on your post and therefore it will perform better for the algorithm or something.\n\nI have some bad news for you (and good news for honest game devs), this is not going to work. Your game is not going to become successful because you use lazy methods of engagement farming to up the numbers on your posts. All you've done is created a mildly \"successful\" reddit post. Which means absolutely nothing for your game sales.\n\nIf I were you, I'd spend less time on engagement farming for upvotes and comment counts, and more time polishing your game and improving the art style. Because the characters in your actual gameplay footage look nothing like either of the characters in your AI generated capsule art images.\n\nFor some reason they are just incredibly generic placeholder characters, and then your actual character has a robot arm?\n\nYou're doing game dev all wrong. It's like you're trying to pump out an asset flip, then prop it up solely on engagement bait social media posts, hoping that somehow all of that will generate lots of sales and you'll be a successful indie dev without actually making a good game.",

Great to see your progress.   \nI really like no 3 and think it has alot of potential so did a quick paint over to what i would do with the pose and perspective.   \nedit: after seeing your trailer i got inspired by your banjo kazoie vibes and screenshoted some of your chunky textures to add to the backdrop for extra roughness.     \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ccrrozgh9khg1.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f935e34bf627a642e8fc27b0f4f9180b94e7b8c\n\nQuick tip when posing, remember its just one angle that need to look good so cheat as much as you can. detach meshes if the rig is to limited, cut off limbs that need posing, add geometry where needed etc. no need to opptimize whats gonna be a single render is what im trying to say.   \n\nGood work :)",

I’ve been gaming my whole life and I’ve never once expected the cover art to look like the actual game, so I dunno why that would change for capsule art.\n\nEdit: do agree that the font looks a bit boring though",

The posing is all wrong in #2. #3 is closer, but it looks very, very amateurish.\n\nI have a lot of issues with #2:\n\n* Character is leaning too far forward for a throw as if they're about to fall on their face after the follow-through.\n* Backwards feather on the underside of the hand with no indication of whether that's supposed to be a pinky curled back (after throwing!?) or just a feather. In general, poor shading on the hand.\n* The motion lines should be on the bomb, not the hand. The hand has already stopped moving and the bomb is what's moving through the air because that's how throwing works.\n   * There's actually one action line that I almost missed because it's rendered the same color as the clouds, which is a classic AI mistake.\n* The clouds tilt towards a common reference point, but the shape of the clouds is weirdly flat.\n* The bomb's right leg has the knee pit visible even though that should be hidden by the front of the leg and knee cap.\n* Inconsistent mouth shape on the bomb. The right, camera-facing side only connects in the back, but the other side has the top and bottom meeting on the far side. It's also weird how the bottom jaw is rendered as a highly reflective metal while the top is a pitch black void.\n   * EDIT: Also just noticed, the upper actually makes a convex shape which suggests we shouldn't see any of the pitch black void, there should be background visible.\n\n\\#2 looks great, but upon inspection has a great number of errors which suggests an insufficient amount of attention was put into its creation, which is inconsistent with how good it looks.",

As long as it’s not completely opposite of your game feel, that’s not what you should be focusing on when designing a capsule image or cover art. \n\nLook at Super Meat Bog for instance. Compare the capsule art vs the in game screenshots. Do the same with binding of Isaac. Both very successful games that don’t follow this “rule.”\n\nIf it truly isn’t AI, and can be proven as such, number 2 is the clear choice. Very eye catching. If it is, then find another artist. You might have to shell out a bit more money, but it’s worth it to have a professional design the capsule. Someone who has more experience with it than most people in this subreddit.",

The expression, the clothes, and especially the colors are great.\n\nIn my opinion, the best choice is image #2. I don’t automatically associate it with AI-generated art, and I think this image shows the game’s vibe exactly like you described..\n\nOne small thought: I’d spend a bit more time on the logo itself. Sometimes what makes something feel AI-generated isn’t the illustration but the logo treatment. If the main name “Gonzalo” and the subtitle “the Chicken” use the same font and color, it can accidentally give that impression. Maybe experimenting with more color variation, a more designed font, or making the lettering feel more distinct could make it feel more handcrafted and interesting overall.\n\nI hope this helps. Good work!!",

Same thing can happen when you playtest your game. People are good at identifying issues, but not necessarily the solution, unless they are in that discipline.\n\nYou might get more actionable advice in an art/illustration sub.\n\nYou CAN use in-game assets to craft a good capsule, but you need to know a little bit about art for it to not look sloppy. If you can't do that, you'll only hurt yourself. Scroll through the capsules + screenshots on Steam's front page for a while, then come back to this post. Do you see the dissonance?\n\nScreenshots show up on hover for a reason. Different styles can still fit better than others, for example a more stylized style, but a capsule is about appeal and mood/genre, not pure accuracy. In any \"packaging\", you're selling a fantasy. The numbers are right there on Steam.\n\nI wrote a more in-depth explanation of this in your original post, and I stand by it.",

Then be an actual creator and make a choice about what you’re building instead of seeking external validation through design-by-committee by a bunch of people that lack context on what your game is or isn’t. Only you know that and you should own it.\n\nNo actual player will care if your capsule looks AI if the game is good.

I did some menu button refactoring and made all my buttons and UI work for keyboard and mouse, and now every button is linked but can work independently having multi uses so it's easier to route menu options, add new ones, or create unique functionalities without spending longer than 30 minutes setting it up. if I have a new idea or option I can just pop it in, test it out, or remove it without any problems.
