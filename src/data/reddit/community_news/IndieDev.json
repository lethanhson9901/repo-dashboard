You can spend 10 years making a game, but if no one likes it, the problem isn't that you worked hard. The problem is you didn't provide any value.\n\nIt's like spending 10 years digging a hole in the middle of the forest and expecting people to celebrate. No one gives a fuck if you spent 10 years digging a hole. Yeah, it's a lot of effort. It's a LOT of hard work. But people only care about what value you provide for them. \n\nOne of the biggest examples I use in the art community is that no one cares if you draw a picture of your cat. But they will care if you use your skills to draw a picture of their cat. Clients don't want art of you. They want art of themselves. \n\nIf you want to sell a product, you have to provide value that the customer wants. Not value that you want. If you want the praise from the internet, give value to the internet.\n\n\\------\n\nThere's nothing wrong with making a product you want that you like. But keep in mind that the validation has to come from yourself and from inside. Make it for you. Enjoy that you made it. Don't get entitled to adoration from strangers when you did it for yourself. \n\nBe proud of your hole in the forest - for you. Don't expect others to care. You did it for you, not them.",

Try to make your game smaller to release it A.S.A.P.  \nMy game was first intended to be much bigger too but I scraped a lot of it because I wanted to meet a deadline. Making your game smaller is not something to be ashamed off it's all part of development!\n\nI hope you will make it I'm seriously rooting for you.\n\nIf you need a play-tester or just some general help with the project hit me up in my DM's and I'll give you my contact info or if there's anything I can do for you I would kindly assist.\n\nWe game-devs should stick up for each other!\n\nBest of luck to you man, all love <3",

Because by making mistakes you learn the best! I made a LOT of mistakes and look at what I did, I released a fricking game!\n\nIf I can do it, you can too!

He went from disinterested to looking like he's interested in the smell of his own farts, and I can't really explain why.

On the second one, though, they look more like they are slightly more generic in-game enemies or villains, if that makes sense. Again, the decision only lies in what those characters actually are and what purpose they serve in the game",

So the bottom one almost looks like it's trying too hard. \n\nAlso, mirroring what another poster says, 'showing teeth makes things more scarier' is a trend that's overdone a bit. It can work, don't get me wrong, but here it feels a bit... silly. Especially on rectangle face on the right. Everyone else's grins are small and understated, to an extent, so it makes them feel more sleazy, greasy, if that makes sense. But blockhead there is trying to convince auntie Bettie that no, in face, he does not need to go to the dentist, and is failing that persuasion check.\n\nEnd of the day, both work, but I'd lean more toward the first option.

Somewhat surprising, considering that the community desired a (fan-made) sequel to a retro game, with a handful of such projects announced, yet none getting into a playable state before being lost in history.\n\nAlso, retrospectively, I might've made some big game design mistakes, as I didn't think of the game from the design standpoint of view, and my decisions were a lot more arbitrary and \"how I like it\", rather than based or well-thought.\n\nResult: at least I know how to code a strategy game, if nothing else.",

It had a bunch of novel systems like a time-based currency to solve the \"money is worthless since world builders can just add as much as they want\" problem.\n\nEverything from graphics and sounds to object scripts could be edited. You can also create custom items and other players can import those items into their own worlds, which would allow them to be used there.\n\nI worked on it for around 10 years on and off, but completely failed to gain any traction with it.\n\nIt still exists as a demo on Steam and is way more complete than any sane person would expect from something with so little publicity. I keep hoping some popular Youtuber will pick it up on a whim and it'll suddenly get attention.",

My eyes get pulled towards the blue point of the arrow because it's so bright.

At 0:59, an eye shoots a laser that gets blocked by your arrow, but his \"warning\" laser doesn't.

Needs to be softened.\n\nYou could argue the main character should have some bounce light from the clouds on her back. That would make her stand out and give her a better silhouette.\n\nThere also needs to be more padding around the main character and the logo. Ie. the background skeletons hand is too close to her. The foreground skeleton and sword are too close to the logo text. Shifting him downwards would do wonders for the padding and also make the main character look even higher in the sky (more majestic).",

With all due respect, that will singlehandedly be the reason this game never sees the light of day.\n\nMaybe a really good game, but unfortunately most people will never know.\n\nMost games in this space don't even ask for anything over $15 at full price. And even that's pushing it. At $10 this game would sell like hotcakes. It would be an impulse buy for a lot of people.\n\nYou also need to consider how that converts to different countries, as a lot of your audience might not even reside in the US. If it's too high for us here, it's probably unobtainable elsewhere.\n\nDifferent type of game, but even Stardew was only asking 15, and theres a lot to offer there.\n\nBest of luck!",

Some videos are on games I never released and gave up on.\n\nAlthough I've learnt a lot, I've learnt what works for me.  \nWhat scripts work good for me, what tone and cadence works for me based on what I'm showing.  \nWhat sort of gameplay works for me. You gotta get out there and experience it and get more and more.\n\nSo for me I know I can do good with either a deadpan semi monotone voice or a really hyper \"content creator\" like voice. Depending on what I'm showing. Then I've found subtitles about 70% of the way up the screen work better for me than being 30-40-50% of the way down. I've always discovered having in-game audio works best for me as well as a subtle background track that's about -15dB. You'll find majority of my videos aren't \"viral\" it's more of a consistency that's getting 30-100k views and not 2-3m+ etc.\n\nThere are all these little things I found that works for me.\n\nThe way I see it is the algorithm is like gambling.. like you can't guarantee every video will do good or it will be viral. Although I think of a hidden RNG chance almost and everything \"good\" you do increases that chance of going viral or it performing good. So if you have terrible audio that's a minus on this invisible RNG scale, if you have amazing script then that's a + on this scale.",

The fact that this came out of a one month build with minimal pre launch marketing just reinforces that speed, iteration, and distribution matter more than perfect polish. The real win here is not the revenue, it’s that you now have hard conversion data you can reuse on every future launch.

Then we’d run what had the best click through rates, adjusting along the way.\n\nCool that you just figured that out! Couldn’t tell you what people do now, and my fiancé is literally top of the field in this lmao \n\nI do believe you created organic growth, and worked hard (and smart) to do it! Congrats!!",

The new one is more friendly, and 'in small' / as thumbnail it looks better. Ahaha maan, capsules are haaard.\n\nHope the gods of marketing smile upon you and you get tons of sales aaaa",

It's unfindable on Google as it always returns Deathloop instead of your game. Seems like quite a big SEO issue. Not sure how to fix that without changing the name of your game though but maybe someone else here has advice for that.\n\nThe big problem with this is that you are gonna lose a big percentage of the people that find your game somewhere online in a video or screenshot and all they have to go on is the name. Many will not bother to launch Steam and look it up there in the search, a part will, but a part won't. So you are definitely going to miss out on a chunk of potential sales due to this issue. If I was you I would take this seriously and fix this before release",

Though I think it's worth mentioning that I also share a slight concern over contrast and readability.\n\nI can see that you put a glow on the player's character to help them stand out, which is a great start.  Though this still doesn't seem to help a ton to differentiate between their character and enemies when the action picks up (between 17s - 20s in the trailer).  I think this is mostly only an issue in the red environment - as humans tend to be a bit less sensitive to contrast in that part of the visual spectrum compared to the greens in the first and last parts of the trailer.  \n  \nObviously though this is hard for me to say for certain without actually playing the game for myself.\n\nThat said, OP should take my advice (and pretty much all feedback) with a grain of salt, but maybe a splash of color added to the player's character would be worth trying.  Particularly a color that isn't often used elsewhere in the visual design language of the game.  I'm imagining a bright red scarf, or purple robe for example.  That, or maybe slightly increase the contrast of the glow effect in that particular environment?\n\nAnyhow... the hard work absolutely shows, and I definitely look forward to checking it out for myself when it launches!",

The odd one is fine if you’re attempting to understand a concept (recommend Sebastian Lague) but don’t copy them.\n\n- Don’t go small - I know the advice is too “make pong” so that you get a finished game but that never motivated me. I got bored really easily so I ended up not caring. Also don’t build your dream game. Go for something that you could theoretically build in 3 months on something that interests you. You like strategy? Build a Tower Defence. You get the idea.\n\n- Limit yourself time wise - don’t push yourself to do as many hours as you can, you’ll just burn out. Do a maximum of x hours a day and write down what you want to accomplish in those hours. You’ll find that you’re more excited to go back to it. Also, time away from a problem helps you reevaluate it with fresh eyes 😊\n\nGood luck!",

Surely a lot of aspiring game devs' first dream is to work in some big companies and be involved in some AAA games, which is not realistic and achievable in a short term.\n\nBut a lot of times, we just have some simple ideas, mechanics, that we are not seeing in any game and we want those custom made. In that case, I'd say do build your dream game, or some simpler variations of it (so it ties back to your pointl).\n\nI guess one of the most important and universal advice for this industry is that, build something you truely love and want to play yourself. If it's not about the survival of your company or anything, like your life depends on it, then nothing else really matters that much honestly if you're passionate about it.",

It is easy to just say \"Do Babysteps\" but this advice is common for a reason. \n\nWhat helped me is physically (or digitally) writing down the task and then breaking it down even further into its subcomponents. You can take this pretty far down. Then you can tackle these subtasks if you find it is still too big you can subdivide it on the fly. You'll feel the progress if you can strike through even just a simple subtasks. It will boost your energy. \n\nThese subtasks can be as simple as \"implement WASD movement\", \"Make a popup\", \"Make character jump\", \"Do one sword sprite\", \"Do a pickup sound\". \n\nAnother advice is to not overthink if what you are doing is right.  Make it crappy first, you can polish it up later.  As your experience grows making old stuff better will be much easier. \n\nIf you are stuck on one problem go the next one maybe you'll find the solution while working on something else. \n\nAlso taking breaks is not bad. Take a breather once an hour/30 minutes. Set a timer for one hour in which you'll work on the game and then set a timer for the breather as well. Maybe also play a game which you can pause or has short levels. Or just go outside for 5 minutes. Different stuff works for different people.\n\nWhat could work is not scaling down the difficulty but scaling down the scope. \n\nAnyway I sincerely hope this helped.",

I looked it up in the manual for the IDE, or Google, or stack overflow. I take notes, I put tons of comments to explain to myself what I'm thinking/doing.\n\n\nIn my free time I watched videos on coding principals and good code habits. Or listened to podcasts about game design, etc.\n\n\nIf I coded something, I would try to remake it in 3 different ways. e.g. state machine, nested if statements, more function-based, more object based, just whatever variations I could think up as 'homework'.\n\n\nI liked the loop of getting stuck and having a breakthrough, though. If failing bums you out, it's much harder to go far with a skill. Program to be better tomorrow, not to be great today.\n\n\nEdit to add: playing games that require you to think like a programmer like factorio or spacechem can be good to learn abstracting problems and reframing stuff.

You have to understand that failing is part of the learning process and Game Development is really high skill field (depending on what you want to achieve). Maybe baby steps are boring but they usually provide you with fundamentals. \n\nYou have a knack for writing though! You can do this. I recommend you start with stuff you like doing. Maybe you are a writer, or a painter, maybe you'd rather learn how to make 3d models or pixel art or something.\n\nGame development isn't just opening a game engine and program gameplay. Maybe for starters, why dont you sit down and physically design your game? Like open a text book, start writing your story, make character designs, theorycraft how your levels are going to look like. Game Design is part of game development as well.\n\nThen you will be able to have a list of features you'd want to have for your game to achieve which will be easier to break down and either look for in tutorials or think on your own. It's easier to solve something small rather than try to write a whole game.\n\nI've started making a game in April 2025 (i'm relatively experienced and a professional game dev). I didn't touch my engine until Late December. Partly due to time constraints but also becuase i was having fun writing down all those and designing and drawing. Game dev is as fun as you want it to be. You don't have to make a game in a month in order to be good. So have fun!",

The dialogs are super intricate (there's a super important dialogue that I reveal in pieces, like the full dialogue is ABCDE, but during the gameplay you'll first hear AC, then later in the game you'll hear AD, then BE etc and you have to put the pieces together, which will gradually explain why the game is happening, and I've had a LOT of fun writing it). The game also has a time loop element to it and it's so beautiful to think and create the timelines, to conceive it so that every version gives the player a specific feeling. And this game is a parenthesis, a focal point that links 2 bigger otherwise unrelated stories (that will each have their own game) and you can play the bigger games without playing this smaller one but you'll be left with unanswered questions. I have a whole universe going on. I also love composing and I sing, and I've created my beautiful characters that I'm so proud of. All that is left, it's putting all of this in UE5 and I hate it",

Organize your work into small steps and in the future as you get familiar with the process you will automatically recognize these steps and arrange them in your head leaving spaces for things that you don't know how to do.\n\nYou will make mistakes and you will most often take a hard way around, then down the line you will figure out that there is a much easier way to do the same thing, this is all part of the process so don't feel the need to do things properly from the beginning, make it work",

          "text": "Bro, making games is hard, especially alone. Still, you can get far if you stay consistent and give it time. I started with very little and after months of learning Godot and Blender I reached this point:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/1nzxtvw/9\\_months\\_learning\\_godot\\_blender\\_and\\_this\\_is\\_what/](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/1nzxtvw/9_months_learning_godot_blender_and_this_is_what/)\n\nIt is also a rough time for gamedevs - a lot of competition and titles on Steam every year so no guarantees it will ever pay off. I treat it as a hobby - I have a stable day job and I am not risking everything on it. But if it pays off... good, learned something and someone paid me to learn stuff. My attitude is - someone fires up Fortnite, I fire up Blender, someone fires up Minecraft, I fire up Godot. Infinitely better to spend time making games than wasting it playing them. I don't even find pleasure in playing games, making them is infinitely more fun for me.\n\nAnd there is a lot to learn. Programming, 3D, art, sound, tools, even editing own damn screenrecordings if you wanna post it on TikTok or YouTube. And then when you think you're done with the development - the marketing nightmare begins (because nobody heard of your game)!!! Good thing is that Steam will take more of an algorithmic approach to the games and push more \"similar content\" to make discovering \"rare gems\" easier so they are at least earning their 30% cut, but even the best algorithm won't help everyone.\n\nIt is not for everyone, but it can be rewarding. After about a year, things that made no sense at the start finally began to click. When I look in the retrospective I can understand how much I've learned so far. You can't see that ahead, only behind.\n\nI'm not trying to discourage you, but to be realistic. Take from this whatever you find useful.",
