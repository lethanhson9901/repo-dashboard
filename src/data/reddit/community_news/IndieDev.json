While being humble and honest with yourself is good, it puts a bias on people before they've even given it a chance. There's a sliver of people that will check it out to see what you consider a flop, but if the guy hitting release calls it a flop, why should anyone bother. If I were on your team, I'd be disappointed seeing this post. I know you're not trying to minimize anyone's efforts, but as someone who has touched the project for 3 years, you should have good confidence. From a marketing standpoint, try to be a better ambassador. Good luck!",

But I got paired with a friend that lived around the block, just me and him. We didn't even have a full team. But somehow, we figured out it would be a good idea to present it as a sock puppet show. We spent weeks making the puppets and the stage and rehearsing. It was very clever and in the end, we killed it! But when it came to standing in front the class as a young freshman who strived to fit in...I faltered. As we got up to do our presentation, I said \"now comes the embarrassing part\" out loud. We do our presentation, absolutely nail it, and get some genuine applause from the audience. And then the teacher gave us her feedback. B+, she would have given us an A+ if I hadn't said what I said in the beginning. I was sooo salty about that moment for so long (I'm sorry for the grade, Mike). A full letter grade, just for my comment? But as an adult, I understand now. Don't denigrate your work because you might be embarrassed of how other people will see it. Be proud that you put forth the effort.",

Or some stuff from cult of lamb; both of those seem to be in the same style of SVG-ish artwork.  But their stuff stands out more to me immediately.\n\nHope it goes well!  I wouldn't shy away from updating some things even after release; even should it mean redoing core artwork.  Sometimes it really pays off.",

If you KNOW the interest is low, why not just price it at 9.99 bucks with 20% off?\n\nNow your game fell flat entirely and because of the way the algorithm works it will never ever pick up again. Such a shame for a great looking game that looks to be made with care and love!\n\nIf you accidentally price your game too low, whats the worst that can happen?

XD it's not mind blowing to me after reading the post and these comments, seems pretty in line with the rest of their actions. From the post and comments I've gathered:\n\n● called their own game a flop in their own post about the launch, already setting a precedent for peoples views/opinions of the game\n\n● didn't plug the game in anyway, no pic, link, etc making it incredibly hard for ppl to check out\n\n● chose a generic title for their game making it even harder to find and check out\n\n● didn't announce the games release on the games/company's social media (someone had to repost an old post to bring attention to it)\n\n● didn't listen to constructive feedback about game elements being hard to understand visually (someone mentioned that they told them a while ago the fire elements or something were hard to understand and that they still weren't changed in release)\n\n● and now you mentioning the price being way too high for this kinda quality and level of game/interest etc.\n\nIt's like they did everything possible in the book to make sure their game failed. Everything is screaming sheer incompitence. Atp it doesn't matter if the games good or not, no ones gonna play it and find out. Whoever is managing things over there did a terrible job, and I would be really annoyed if I worked on this game.",

Then, you can tell the difference between small enemies which get more vibrant as a whole as you approach, sooner, and large enemies who get vibrant more \"slowly\" because they are actually further away, (and also as they get close eg their feet will become vibrant before their head which is further away)\n\nAnother way of indicating this that I like, is to have certain enemy characteristics that stay the same size even when the enemy variant is larger - eg they all have the same-sized face and nuts-and-bolts accoutremonts that appear relatively smaller for the comparatively larger variant. However, this requires having encountered the enemy before to become effective.\n\nAlso, don't forget that you can use this illusion of \"I cant tell if that is a normal enemy up close or a titan far away\" can actually be used for practical and deliberate effect - imagine you have them fight a bunch of half-sized enemies, then a you-sized enemy, then you see off in the distance eg what appears to be a regular enemy with a pack of half-pints, but as you walk towards them, they aggro and as they get closer, the fog shifts and suddenly you realize, those arent half-pints, and the guy commanding them is a titan, and you are not prepared for this...\n\n(Minor edit for clarity)",

Everything is built of just planes with sprited on them, so they are actual 3D meshes, but.. just planes at different depths. This gives a small feeling of 3D, while keeping the game very simple when it comes to graphics etc.\n\nYour implementation looks very cool. I'm fascinated how animating that thing will work out.",

The sand turns to plants.  Water flowing down a mountain will erode the land into a flowing river, and even create a delta, leading to the sea.\n\nThis feature looked *incredible* and was light-years ahead of its time.\n\nVolcanoes will leak magma that burns the grass and turns the sand and water into stone.  You can use your god powers to \"scoop up\" huge spheres of elements to toss around.  \n\n\nIt was so cool.. *dune* something?

Love the artistic style and the water looks especially rad!   \n  \nOne thing I'd expect to see is the ability to place down randomized clusters of foliage. So like, instead of just a single bush or tree, there is an area of effect circle that can paint a bunch of stuff down at once, so to speak. Speed up the process of placing things down, but then having the ability to delete and move individual objects. \n\nAnd then as others have said, having a way to plant specific trees or shrubs that could then attract certain types of animals would be really cool. It could even be almost like a tech-tree, where you plant a certain type of berry, which brings small birds and deer to the island, or you plant trees close to the water, giving places for sea life to create homes in which attracts cranes or dolphins. \n\nthis last idea would be a lot and probably beyond the scope, but something I've always wanted to see in a game like this is the ability to speed up time by x10000, so you can watch the world change from erosion and weather and see a simulation of what your island would look like 1,000,000 years into the future in 100 seconds. You'd probably be doing PhD levels of research in order to implement a simulation on that scale but would be really cool. \n\nAll in all, keep up the awesome work! Looking forward to seeing future posts about this! :D",

How can a player use it to come to moments of realization and understanding?\n\nThe thing that would disappoint me most is if the game had cool sandbox physics but no meaningful way to use them to interact with the world. It's gorgeous, don't get me wrong, but that can only hold someone's attention for so long.",

Climate zones and seasonal changes would act as the underlying framework, influencing what could appear, evolve, or be generated in each area of the world.\n\nEven though I didn’t finish that project, the conceptual model still feels solid to me, and I can clearly see how it could integrate naturally with systems like this one.",

I mostly don't care when a game says it's unsupported as that means very little. I care quite a lot when a game says it's verified.\n\nOne thing that I always look for is whether or not the game claims to support controller. I've tried playing games that don't and 99% of the time it doesn't end well (and steam even considers these to be playable, which is absurd imo)",

It's also about what it indicates about the developer's future support to leave a game as \"unsupported\" vs a dev that tries to get it to supported. I'm a Linux desktop gamer with a Steam Deck and the idea of needing to do work to know whether a game works on Linux or to do work to get it working on Linux is such a turn off in my limited free time. When I want to game, I want to game. I don't want to read about people's strategies getting some game working.\n\nIt's like how after years of trying every version of Windows, the BSDs, various Linux distros... all of the major desktop environments and window managers... different package managers, etc... That these days I'm too busy to deal with what were once minor things about getting a new environment working and am happy to stay on a boring \"it just works\" platform for the long haul... Similarly, at this point, I just want things to work. When I look at games I just want to pick one and play, I don't want to waste ANY of my limited time researching what games might secretly work or how to get them working. It's just completely unnecessary when so many games work so well. I already have more games than I could play, why would I waste more time not playing games?",

One of the main reasons I was so looking forward to the Steam deck was that it in itself is a benchmark - something for developers to aim for and optimise their games for, similar to console gaming. \n\nIt really annoyed me to hell that so many indie Devs would just like... pluck the latest version of Unreal Engine, not optimise it at all and just be like \"oh, if it doesn't run well on your machine maybe you should just upgrade your machine!\"... \n\nThat being said, I'll often try games on my deck even if they aren't verified (or even technically supported). A lot of games fail compatibility for silly reasons like small text or showing keyboard binds in tutorials. I don't care much about those things, but I really love that it gives Devs a target of \"I should make it run well on a machine with these particular specs\"",

But in reality, if you actually do this, the log stays in place, because it’s a single object and its two ends aren’t independent of each other. Once I realized this, I understood that I had to break some physics rules. After all “it’s just a game” 😅",

Same in my job.\n\nSelf-documenting code is not only about simple clean-code principles like consistent and intuitive naming convention and short functions/methods. There are more things like domain modelling (and implementing it), design patterns, OOP (or any other paradigm you use), or software architecture in general.\n\nFor example: why would you need such a variable? Looks like a code smell, suggesting that the issue lies somewhere else, and the need for something like this one is just an unfortunate side effect. Now you can comment it (duct tape fix) or redesign your code.\n\nPersonally, I think that in-line comments are ok only if your code is hard to read by design - like complex math or not-human-readable algorithms. In such cases, it should be encapsulated into a black box that you won't touch too often, along with the inline comments.\n\nTop-level documentation, on the other hand, may be useful to introduce new devs. If needed.\n\nSometimes when I worked on team projects, and I had a requirement to document everything, my docs were mostly the same as the methods/functions/classes signatures because there was no need to add more info.",

An approach that's still cheap (or free even) for those without or a low budget is to rely on your play testers using their own machines (you should have play testers anyway). Have testers provide hardware specifications and capture or report performance data to find out minimum specs throughout development  and thus real hardware varieties in architecture, clock behavior, cache sizes, storage speed, thermal limits, and countless other factors that influence performance that VM's CAN'T accurately represent, even with limited CPUs, GPUs, memory configurations.\n\nRegardless though, I find your solution funny OP",

For your own sake I really think you should take the advice of other commenters and put some effort into using a virtual machine or something to estimate minimum specs. As someone who has a lower end computer, if I saw the minimum specs on your steam page just telling me to \"download the demo and see yourself if it works\",  I'm not gonna download the demo to see if it works. I'm gonna click off your steam page and find something else to play, that actually lets me know if it will run on my computer. The only way I think you could get away with your original approach is if its on the level of a 2d flash game or something.",

This makes all but B preferable to me.\n\nSecond, The front of the packaging has hard edges, which are best represented in A and D. The softer right edge of the front plane doesn't make sense visually for me on C.  \n\n\nThird, the vacuum formed packaging around toys is easier to see right next to them since the translucent material is parallel to the camera's view, essentially being a thicker material. The outline on B and D reflects that expectation with the grey outline. The drop shadow on A is also really nice, but I feel like D looks more like packaging at a glance. A would feel a bit like a toy from the 80s or 90s where its free-floating in the packaging, attached with a plastic or wire tie.",
