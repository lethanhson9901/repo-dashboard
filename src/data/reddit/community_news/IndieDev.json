I then did a bit of research and settled on Reaper after trying out other DAWs that had a trial option or were free. It's got a ton of flexibility and since I'm starting, I might as well go with what has a very high ceiling. On top of that, it's compatible with every plugin that I downloaded initially for MPK Mini Plus setup, and I also downloaded a bunch of free plugins afterwards (making sure to read licences). I got a ton of samples and instruments now and I've only been messing with this for a few days. Reaper sounded like it has a steep learning curve, but from my experience, it's not bad at all.

For example: every music that you gona render out of FL studio has a mark on it that it was rendered by FL. So if you didnt buy license and for some reason you will hit some kind of success and sell the game then you can expect lawsuit. So insted of FL use LMMS. Its a bit clunkier, but does everything the same and its more than you need for a pixel game that Im assuming you are working on since you have Aseprite.",

This is a BIIIG one (and from what we've seen no one ever agrees what makes it soulslike, but for us it's the following!  \n  \n\\- We've made it so that every action you do has a cost, things like jumping, attacking etc all costs stamina, but you also have a secondary resource called heat which you generate by attacking (and spending stamina)\n\n\\- Enemies have patterns and you have to adapt your approach to beat them\n\n\\- We've also included the same ability for the enemies (creating and using heat to do some amazing attacks), so there's no easy fights.\n\nAnd loads more but I don't want to already stretch the wall of text answer you're getting :D",

The way the boat wiggles a little bit as you go for it again helps too. You’re excited to break the ice, I’m excited for you to break the ice, and then you phase straight through it with no collision and the video ends. \n\nIt’s literally the funniest video I’ve seen all week. You’re going in a good direction! I don’t think you need to rethink anything! I like your posts, I’m excited to see how your game turns out :)",

If I can see she’s visible, I know she can attack.\n\nSecondly, it would be good to keep in mind that if you expect maybe YouTubers or streamers will play this game, then they might have an issue with the amount of individual things lying around.

I do like that you’re basing it off of a weeping angel though. \n\nA couple ideas:\n\n- to make it more interesting, you could do something like the positions of the eye poles change after breaking one. Otherwise, it looks like you’re just going to go around in a circle and be done with it.\n\n- if I was an ice-controlling, witch who can only move when I’m not being looked at, I’d figure out ways to break line of sight. Maybe have her drop or summon occasional ice walls or pillars that break line of sight for the player. That would make it feel like she’s actually hunting you and you can’t just rely on her being there in the center. It’d also create a maze-like effect where you have to work to find the eye poles.\n\nAnyway, just some ideas.",

You say she moves when you are not looking at her, and it sounds like that is the main mechanic of the fight. But why would you ever look away from her? \n\nThe only attack comes from her, so you want to be looking at her to dodge it. The eye totem things are in a circle, so if you just move in a circle you will find one eventually and don't have to actively look around. There are no obstacles/hazards on the ground, so theres no reason to look where you are going. And like others have said theres no challenge to the dodging since you can just hold left/right and you are good. So the strategy is just hold left till you find a totem, then kill it, then repeat.\n\nThere needs to be something more. For example, she has an additional attack that fills random patches of the ground with spikes for a few seconds, so you need to look around to avoid them. It would also make dodging her other attack harder since you can't just hold a direction because you would run into a spike.",

          "text": "To add some feedback:\n- As others commented, movement is slow, and doesn't feel good\n- The path of the ice attack feels too predictable. That's good, if it's supposed to be a very easy boss, but bad if you expect any kind of challenge\n- The \"frozen if looking at it\" is nice in theory, but I see some problems with the current implementation:\n  - It's rotating and attacking. I understand that it's just \"\"not moving\"\" in a quite gramatical way, but the concept feels not fully integrated\n  - Her name is \"The ice witch\". There's nothing that tells me that \"looking at her\" will do anything. Lorewise, it feels bland. You could \"explain it to the player\", but, as usual, show, don't tell. And yes, the player could \"detect the pattern\" after fighting a bit. But it would look very arbitrary (again, lorewise).\n  - Are there any visual/audio clues of it not being able to move when looking at her? In the video you're always looking at her, so hard to tell. It could be interesting. Paradoxically, you can't just change the model or anything, because _you can't see her when you're not looking at her_. Maybe some audio\n- The eyes, I'm supposing you have to kill them before reaching her? If that's it, it would be nice to have also some visual clues of why is it that way. Is she invulnerable? Is she stronger? Hard to tell. This is a nitpick; many games let you discover it the hard way (like souls-likes, or even WoW bosses), so it depends on the kind of game and difficulty. And how much it hurts to fail.\n\nI see this is the final boss of the homonymous game; part of the feedback is thinking about it as just another boss, so take it with a grain of salt. Good work!",

              "text": "Thanks for the comment. I've had a lot to think about with what everyone has said.\n\nYes, the video shows the player's slow walk speed, and not their sprint speed. That was a mistake on my part. An adjustment in movement is a change that I can definitely make.\n\nI did intend for the ice attack to be predicable. I was trying to consider a wide range of player skill levels/reaction times, but I may need to rethink how I'm doing that. Maybe with a difficulty setting in the main menu.  \n\nAs for the Weeping Angel mechanic, up until the battle, she has functioned in the usual sense of being completely frozen in place when in view, stalking the player as they travel through the environment, appearing in the shadows, and attacking only if you let her get too close to you. When you’re not looking, she makes ice crackling sounds and laughs to indicate that she is moving toward you. Lorewise, I thought of her as being a \"living ice sculpture.\" To better incorporate this idea into the final battle, I agree with what a lot of people have suggested to add things in the arena that force you to break line of sight. That would prevent her from simply being locked the whole time.\n\nThe main narrative of the game is that you are trying to free your wife from a curse that has turned her into this witch. That tall obelisk in the center of the arena is basically possessing her. You discover the player character's motivation and relationship to the witch over the course of the game via clues found around the environment.  It's not shown in the video, but you cannot attack the witch directly. If you try, she will take no damage and teleport away behind you. Your real focus is to destroy the eyes and the obelisk. This battle takes place at the end of the game after you've trekked through a cold snowy forest, collecting magic gems to forge a weapon strong enough to break that obelisk and the curse. There is an underlying emotional element to this fight. The player character doesn't actually want to harm her. He wants to heal her. And he is thrown into this battle reluctantly.\n\nI think there may be a disconnect in the story I wanted to portray and the mechanics that I'm using to do so.\n\nThis is also my first post in this sub. I had no idea it would get this much response, and for that I am truly grateful. I plan on using what I've learned here to make the game better.",

Solely going off what I'm seeing here it seems like basic wasd with a relatively slow run speed. You could increase run speed and that might improve it a bit, but I think you should also consider secondary movement mechanics like rolling, dashing etc. \n\nheres a quote from Shigeru Miyamoto that I think is super important \"We wanted to make a game where **just moving Mario around was fun**.\" its short and simple but its really insightful, make it fun to simply move the character around. Try it out in your game, turn all your enemies off and run around for a bit, if its fun than great your doing good, if not maybe add some move movement mechanics or tweak existing mechanics.",

Okay, there's three floating eyes I guess, but like you did in the clip, I can just walk back and left to get to where I wanna be without even looking away. If you are giving us an enemy like that, you also NEED to give us a reason to look away. An additional enemy, ice traps, etc. Something we also need to look out for.\n\nThe ice wall seems...boring.

Either make the player character zoom towards it which makes it disappear or just materialize at it and the cursor disappears. Make the cursor break apart into pieces for extra effect and infuse into the player character.\n\nGame looks fun and I imagine the more you progress in the game the more crazy it becomes.

I did not even see the windows cursor the first time I watched it as I was reading text and watching the other yellow arrow. To you it's probably obvious but a first time watcher has a lot to take in. I'd take the yellow arrow and as the camera transitions, rotate it to become a 'cursor'. For every shot try to have only 1 point in camera where the eyes should go. I can't look at two places at once.",

There was an article in a German gaming website that brought over 1000 wishlists over a week.  \nI think about half of the wishlists are probably from advertising (in Reddit, Youtube and Meta ads), and the rest from those articles/videos and steam visibility.\n\nThis is the latest trailer I have been using: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aa5SAbrrF0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aa5SAbrrF0)",

Thank you for wishlisting!!\n\nYes, here you have resources and you can produce units and also build new factories and defenses.\n\nI just added the option to procedurally generate rectangular maps too [last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastGeneral/comments/1prh2bz/now_maps_can_be_long_rectangles_too_10km_x_40km/), so they can be 10km x 40km for example. The maximum area of 400km2 is because of gameplay reasons, Unity floating point precision and performance.   \nAfter +/- 10km you lose milimeter precision in Unity so things start looking a bit choppier than I would like, but it's not that noticeable. Performance on such huge maps is a bigger issue, and the gameplay becomes extremely long and slow (which is really cool, but probably not for everyone). Imagine sending your troops from one side of the map to another and they take 30 minutes to drive there, it's pretty crazy.\n\nPlanes in the game come from off-map allies or mainland for nations that have a mainland outside of the TLG archipelago so the size of the island doesn't affect them that much, they just come flying, shoot at something and flee.",

The conversations were promising. They liked the art style, the retention on the vertical slice was decent, and the mechanics were tight.\n\nThen I get an email on Tuesday: \"We want to hold off unless we can see a co-op build by end of month.\"\n\nI hopped on a call, thinking maybe I misunderstood the timeline.\n\nTheir reasoning? They saw the numbers Lethal Company and Content Warning were doing and decided that social virality is a requirement for their portfolio now.\n\nThey literally said, \"Can’t you just let a second player spawn in? We don't need dedicated servers yet, just P2P.\"\n\nI had to explain, politely, that a deterministic simulation built entirely for single-player logic doesn't just accept a second input stream without rewriting the entire core loop and netcode from scratch.\n\nThey passed on the project. Honestly, it's probably for the best, but the trend-chasing is getting exhausting.\n\nHow do you guys handle it when non-technical partners think Multiplayer is just a feature you toggle in the engine settings?\n\n",

Spoiler alert, they all skipped that part.\n\n>the trend-chasing is getting exhausting\n\nThat's the reality we live in: MVPs with massive traction aka. sure bets (even made a short clip of Gollum saying those two words, lol, because it's soo frustrating to hear over and over). They say you should only reach out to those publishers who are most compatible, but what if there isn't any because all they want is a copy of an already existing game? (so your and their taste will never match)\n\n*And gamers tout that the renaissance of indie gaming is coming. From where though?*\n\nWhile you dodged a bullet, the market isn't better higher up either (at larger publishers); in fact worse, 'cos you'll be lucky to talk to one in person.",

If you don’t have the luxury to create art entirely on your own terms, you eventually have to deal with that reality.\n\nGood luck.",

If they aren’t able to effectively market the game they may need the game to market itself by friends getting friends to play with them.\n\nI’m not saying SP games of this sort can’t be successful (and I know that there are tons of anecdotal examples of success). I’m saying that I understand why a small publisher would make this call.\n\nAs for the requirement to add MP in a month. Maybe that’s them completely underestimating what it would take. Or maybe they decided they couldn’t carry a SP game and were providing this option in the off-chance it would be possible (maybe you had designed it as player agnostic event driven from the start). Either way I suspect the we’re trying to be nice by saying no, but offering an out (even an impossible one).\n\nFor you, it’s worth considering their concerns and the reasons why they don’t think your game is viable for them. Maybe they are wrong. Maybe you have another way to address the concerns. But it’s worth considering (even if you decide not to react).",

I have experienced this by the way. \n\nSo you post online on itch.io but there is another problem nobody is interested in trying prototypes that look visually bad even if gameplay is good \n\nThe only exception I have found is unless you are already a reputable developer or have an existing audience like on YouTube or any social media platform then it will work out.\n\nIdk I find it incredibly hard when developers say it validate your ideas fast, because how the hell do you do that when you don't have money to throw or don't have an existing reputation. Even if you are an experienced developer it will still be hard to validate whether something is actually good or not \n\nThe way I am going about it currently is probably to make a basic prototype, see if I even like it. Then give it to developer friends and see their reactions, give it to close friends , see what they tell , which can still be deceiving. Then personally decide based on how the internal testing went whether to pursue doing a vertical slice.\n\nWhen the vertical slice is done then I think it's worth doing an free itch release to see what people think ,at this point I think you can get pretty good visibility based on the genre you are making. This is the only I feel you can get good feedback from everybody.\n\n\nEven then this can still take anywhere from 2 to 4 months or even more which is still quite long.",

Or that the dungeon progression I have planned was not fun and there wasn't any real choice, and that they would have liked it to be a 2d dungeon with rooms and different paths. This helped me get to a 3rd prototype which I'm working to have it go through another playtest soon (I'm just prototyping and getting feedback for the past 2 months).",

This would be the absolute number 1 reason even above funding (because technically it replaces some necessary funding). Publishers tend to already have a name that audiences are familiar with. They tend to already have a marketing network ready, and they tend to already be better at it than you.\n- funding. You can cut potential funding deals to keep your development viable.\n- experience. They likely have more combined experience than you, and probably across platforms you haven't published on yet also, so that's a plus.\n\nNone of this is to say that self publishing is impossible or shouldn't be done, but publishers (good ones) are good.",

It's hard to tell exactly, but this does reek of some AI learning shit.\n\n  \nEdit: Or maybe not, a mod on the itch subreddit mentions bots boosting download-numbers and this being their hiding strategy. That actually makes sense too and i recall this has happened before;\n\n\"Not a bug exactly. Sometimes we get people try to bot download counts, and they'll hit other pages to attempt to hide their activity. It's generally safe to ignore and they'll get blocked soon enough.\"",

This along with the story I think are the sources of the game's success, but copycats tend to go the opposite direction of adding more stuff.\n\nA successful copy of CO would strip away the game even further while focusing more on a cool narrative.\n\nIf there are copies of it, I don't think they'll actually get it.

The games we saw at the games awards will get some more announcements and we will see yet another Skyrim related update. Ai will hopefully bust but I think that’s still a few years. The amount of ai slop games will exponentially grow as a means of fake games on top of these fake games we’re getting now. But we’ll get a few really great games and a couple decent games and your usual shooters. We will at the very least see a change in the industry good or bad more likely bad with the current trends.

They will get a lot of praise for it, with a few of them getting actual financial success thanks to luck and an original and talented art direction. However, AI will creep into most development environments through less obvious means such as code assistance, AI-enhanced procedural level generation, etc.\n\nIndie devs will have to choose between the easy low-budget route (with public backlash) and the hard, uncertain route.\n\nWell-intentioned companies and solo devs will commission artists whom they trust, but who will use AI in their back. More controversies, more backlash, money and time will be lost.\n\nThe most major technical breakthrough will (I hope) be a VR live sandbox world generator, which will be ignored by most of the public because of VR set prices.\n\nGodot, Unity, Unreal and other engines will integrate coding agents/assistants.\n\nEveryone will get the uneasy feeling that it's an 'adapt or fail' situation.\n\nI'll keep programming for the love of the game tho.\n\nOh and my hand-drawn AI-free 2D platformer, Hachichi will release.",

You completely missed my point, I'm concerned that within 5-10 years, it will be normalised within game development (borderline standard), far less time in other jobs. AI-assist tools (like chat-gpt, but dev orientated) were recently introduced to unreal engine. It is already begin inter-layered within game dev.\n\n But it's easy to say your opinion now, but unfortunately, AI is progressing at a staggering rate, and we are yet to see any of the 'benefit'. Like with the Industrial Revolution, change happened, regardless of all the opposition. You are talking of current tech, forgetting gen AI 5-10 years likely won't even be recognisable, unless governments restrict said technology's unhindered growth, which is unfortunately unlikely. It will likely replace accounting, managerial, even coding (in an non-obstructive way). AI is an attempt 'streamlining' companies to save money.",
