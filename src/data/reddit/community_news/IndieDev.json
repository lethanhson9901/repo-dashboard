You can spend 10 years making a game, but if no one likes it, the problem isn't that you worked hard. The problem is you didn't provide any value.\n\nIt's like spending 10 years digging a hole in the middle of the forest and expecting people to celebrate. No one gives a fuck if you spent 10 years digging a hole. Yeah, it's a lot of effort. It's a LOT of hard work. But people only care about what value you provide for them. \n\nOne of the biggest examples I use in the art community is that no one cares if you draw a picture of your cat. But they will care if you use your skills to draw a picture of their cat. Clients don't want art of you. They want art of themselves. \n\nIf you want to sell a product, you have to provide value that the customer wants. Not value that you want. If you want the praise from the internet, give value to the internet.\n\n\\------\n\nThere's nothing wrong with making a product you want that you like. But keep in mind that the validation has to come from yourself and from inside. Make it for you. Enjoy that you made it. Don't get entitled to adoration from strangers when you did it for yourself. \n\nBe proud of your hole in the forest - for you. Don't expect others to care. You did it for you, not them.",

I love level design in blender and even though it's tedious it's fun to texture levels and see them come together I also find environment decoration and making puzzles some of the fun stuff. But all in all making games is a responsibility more than anything you have to create something and you gotta be disciplined enough to work on it every single day. Even when you don't want to. Take breaks though play games in between work a couple hours and go on break. If you gotta take aderol, drink caffeine or booze, smoke cigarettes or weed doesn't matter just work work work and some day your hard work will pay off if you make your game actually good.",

Most of it is healthy criticism towards the \"David vs Goliath\" narratives and storylines that were heavily pushed by the media and TheGameAwards for an entire year, and criticism towards the devs that are now playing with the \"indie\" line despite previously claiming to be AA, even in the early stages of the game's development.\n\nThere is also the side that has genuine criticism about the game design, writing, world building, even art direction, etc., which has a hard time being heard because e33's community is very intense/toxic and tends to dismiss rapidly all of that with the \"you clearly never played this game\" all-purpose catchphrase, which may have lead people to genuinely hate the game this time around... but this is, for the most part, not what this is about, this is about the game status as an indie title which is being heavily debated even by the game's most loyal online warriors.",

You don't want AI supporters in you community, almost nobody in the indie game community likes them).\n\nIn the end (in my view, because I had terrible interactions with E33 fans) the aggressive defense from the E33 fans kinda messed up the view of the game for some people. This is nothing new, big overly defensive communities always act like this and the reputation of the game takes a hit.",

                  "text": "> That's a strawman argument though. \n\nIt isn't. We need to be using the same word to mean the same thing, and this is at the core of the issue. Some people use Indie in the original meaning: \"Without a publisher\". Under that definition, it isn't indie, but Baldur's Gate 3 is. Some use Indie to mean \"small budget, small studio\", under which it wouldn't be considered indie, but publishers are on the table. Like Sifu, the indie game from 2021 that got nominated at the Game Awards, funnily enough published by the same publisher as E33. \n\nAnd some people use Indie to mean \"single A\" as opposed to \"AA\" and \"AAA\". Which has never really been its meaning and only serves to further confuse the terms, as AA and AAA don't have rigid meanings either. \n\n> We're not talking about a team of 3 that were given $100,000 to fund their project and we're trying to define where the line for indie is.\n\nRight. Because 100,000 is a lot more than many indies make their games on. And that's only if you count budget and studio size. And 30-something people in one studio isn't particularly big either, I've worked at a studio roughly that size before. \n\nLet me just ask you then. Hollow Knight: Silk Song. A team of 3 people. Estimated millions in budget. Is it indie? And please do explain: Why?",

An AA production, with lots of outsourcing and a major publisher and not really that small of a team. It has all the business strategy of a larger studio, even if Sandfall is independent, Exp33 is not developed independently. \n\nThat's no reason to hate on it but it's presentation as indie despite the resources the studio took advantage of inflates the view of what an indie team can do and puts wayyy too much pressure on indie developers. I think it's bad to call it indie because it is not doable by an indie studio without ample resources like Sandfall had.",

People are also a little sick and tired of 2D platformers and melee centric Metroidvanias and cheap walking simulator horror games.

And I get it if it becomes your only job.. you kind of have no choice but to focus on that unless you get lucky. But it does ultimately harm indie games.

I am currently 40 hours in and just finished act 2 so this is just my impressions up until this point (no spoilers).\n\nThe Good\n\nThe music in this game is fantastic. It has a wide variety and many of the songs are absolute bangers that I listen to on Spotify. The story is really interesting and keeps you wanting to learn more. Hard to say much about the story without spoilers but it's really good. These are the parts of the game that have me booting the game up when I have time to play something.\n\nThe Bad\n\nSome of the interface and progression in this game is often annoying. There are buffs you can equip to your characters but in order to 'unlock' them to be used freely you have to use them a few times by equipping them to a character. This means you are often forced to shuffle around your builds every 30min if you want to 'unlock' these buffs to use later. The weapon loot system is similarly strange with weapons scaling off seemingly random stats so if you want to use a cool new weapon you picked up you have to go to a rest site and respect all your stats. For the most part you can put off interacting with these systems every time you get something new and just change things when you get something you want to use but you do have to interact with the system and it can get annoying.\n\nI also just want to throw in here it is laughable this game won best RPG over KCD 2 because while the story is great your character choices have little to no influence over at all from what I've seen and the game lacks any major exploration. The story may be a fun rollercoaster but you're still mostly on tracks.\n\nThe Other\n\nThe combat in this game is interesting. I'm personally a big fan of turn based strategy games and while there are some strategy elements here the game focuses way more around a party and dodge system. It can be pretty satisfying to perfectly parry an entire combo from a boss but also any strategy is mostly irrelevant as long as you can just hit the parry button at the right time. Overall I would give the combat like a 7/10 fun enough to keep playing but definitely not a selling point for me.\n\nThe art in this game while pretty can also become a bit repetitive after a while. Particularly with enemy design I felt there was a severe lack of interesting enemy designs, though I will probably get a lot of flack for this. But yeah there are definitely areas that are stunning mostly just saying it has its moments.\n\nAll in all good game just unsure if it's my game of 2025 yet",

After long months and years of building the foundation (and the netcode, of course), I managed to make it work, and it was more or less ready for the game content to be added, to make it an actual game.\n\nThen, I put the project on ice. I intented the content to be crowd-sourced, however, the project didn't get any traction in the relevant community, which was small and quite apathetic to such endeavors. Somewhat surprising, considering that the community desired a (fan-made) sequel to a retro game, with a handful of such projects announced, yet none getting into a playable state before being lost in history.\n\nAlso, retrospectively, I might've made some big game design mistakes, as I didn't think of the game from the design standpoint of view, and my decisions were a lot more arbitrary and \"how I like it\", rather than based or well-thought.\n\nResult: at least I know how to code a strategy game, if nothing else.",

It had a bunch of novel systems like a time-based currency to solve the \"money is worthless since world builders can just add as much as they want\" problem.\n\nEverything from graphics and sounds to object scripts could be edited. You can also create custom items and other players can import those items into their own worlds, which would allow them to be used there.\n\nI worked on it for around 10 years on and off, but completely failed to gain any traction with it.\n\nIt still exists as a demo on Steam and is way more complete than any sane person would expect from something with so little publicity.

It's hard to know where to look and it's possible people will miss the part about stepping on the arrow.i kind of like the arrow going through the word arrow in the first one, though it's less readable, so one idea is to underline the title with an arrow. Maybe you can also add a silhouette of a foot on the balls of the feet stepping onto the arrow. Some more clear symbology that communicates stepping on it. Not sure though. The key problem with #2 is that it's very busy.",

My eyes get pulled towards the blue point of the arrow because it's so bright. I would argue that the foot stepping on the arrow is one of the most important elements of the capsule and yet it has as much visibility as the random enemies on the bottom, if not less.\n\nOf course, the bottom one is better and more professionnal than the top one. I especially dislike how empty the bottom right area of the top capsule is.\n\nI watched your trailer on steam. At 0:59, an eye shoots a laser that gets blocked by your arrow, but his \"warning\" laser doesn't. I think it should, it's inconsistent.\n\nAlso both eye's lasers stop after some point even though they don't hit anything. Is it a",

Shifting him downwards would do wonders for the padding and also make the main character look even higher in the sky (more majestic).",

Old character without the clouds behind her and with the high contrast hair sticks out a lot more than new character with a busy background and lower contrast colors.\n\nFar too many enemies in the new art. It's like there was a challenge to squeeze as many enemies into one image as possible. Get rid of the ghost, the eyeball and bat in the background... shift the two skeletons more to the right. Get rid of the tree tops... they are barely readable as tree tops and look kind of like pointed roof tops.\n\nScale and move the foreground eyeball down slightly more, to give the girl more space around her to breathe.\n\nDarken the sky background more and ramp up the brightness on the girl more.\n\nFinally, thicken the font slightly, tighten the glow so it's a bit sharper, and add the arrow going through the text again as it's a nice unique element to the text.",

The bright arrow tip catches my attention, but then does nothing with it. I like the title, except for the odd 'r'. Skeletons are fine. The eye and ghost don't work for me.  The background just blends together and the building tops have odd perspective. A lot of the perspective seems wrong to me. The character and the left building are together. The two skeletons are together. After that everything is on their own plane.\n\nJust to be clear, neither are bad.",

Some videos are on games I never released and gave up on.\n\nAlthough I've learnt a lot, I've learnt what works for me.  \nWhat scripts work good for me, what tone and cadence works for me based on what I'm showing.  \nWhat sort of gameplay works for me. You gotta get out there and experience it and get more and more.\n\nSo for me I know I can do good with either a deadpan semi monotone voice or a really hyper \"content creator\" like voice. Depending on what I'm showing. Then I've found subtitles about 70% of the way up the screen work better for me than being 30-40-50% of the way down. I've always discovered having in-game audio works best for me as well as a subtle background track that's about -15dB. You'll find majority of my videos aren't \"viral\" it's more of a consistency that's getting 30-100k views and not 2-3m+ etc.\n\nThere are all these little things I found that works for me.\n\nThe way I see it is the algorithm is like gambling.. like you can't guarantee every video will do good or it will be viral. Although I think of a hidden RNG chance almost and everything \"good\" you do increases that chance of going viral or it performing good. So if you have terrible audio that's a minus on this invisible RNG scale, if you have amazing script then that's a + on this scale.",

I found when I add a CTA it feels very like okay he said that to try and get me to buy or something. So the only true CTA I use is in the comments I pin a comment saying the game name and mentioning that it's on steam. Although if you want a CTA in the video I would recommend putting an image of your store page, more specifically the capsule art and description part and say (Petal Pals can be wishlisted on steam) I do this instead of (you can now wishlist petal pals on steam) as a LARGE portion of people don't finish a video and so if you can get your game name as early in the script that works better.",

It also quietly kills the myth that Steam “finds” good games on its own. Steam amplifies momentum, it does not create it. \n\nYou injected demand and the system responded. The fact that this came out of a one month build with minimal pre launch marketing just reinforces that speed, iteration, and distribution matter more than perfect polish. The real win here is not the revenue, it’s that you now have hard conversion data you can reuse on every future launch.

Though I think it's worth mentioning that I also share a slight concern over contrast and readability.\n\nI can see that you put a glow on the player's character to help them stand out, which is a great start.  Though this still doesn't seem to help a ton to differentiate between their character and enemies when the action picks up (between 17s - 20s in the trailer).  I think this is mostly only an issue in the red environment - as humans tend to be a bit less sensitive to contrast in that part of the visual spectrum compared to the greens in the first and last parts of the trailer.  \n  \nObviously though this is hard for me to say for certain without actually playing the game for myself.\n\nThat said, OP should take my advice (and pretty much all feedback) with a grain of salt, but maybe a splash of color added to the player's character would be worth trying.  Particularly a color that isn't often used elsewhere in the visual design language of the game.  I'm imagining a bright red scarf, or purple robe for example.  That, or maybe slightly increase the contrast of the glow effect in that particular environment?\n\nAnyhow... the hard work absolutely shows, and I definitely look forward to checking it out for myself when it launches!",
