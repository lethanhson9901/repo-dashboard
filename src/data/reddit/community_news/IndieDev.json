          "text": "I am an instructor on Udemy and I have \\~50k students. At some point I decided to make free courses to attract more people and it was a mistake. My free courses would get a lot of 1 star reviews, mean time paid content would mostly get 5 star reviews.  In the end, I just had to take down all free content because it was effecting my overall instructor rating. I think it's in the psychology or something. My wife tells me, when people pay for things, they are less likely to complain because if they do, they sort of admit that they did not spend money wisely and it would make them fools.  I just think people are taking a lot for granted and do not appreciate other's people work.  \n  \nI swear man, you start giving away gold, some of them folks will complain it's to heavy to carry",

It's becoming a lot more common than it used to be, but you'll see all sorts of items including games routinely priced at 60% off. A $100 new release on a time limited 60% off sale is generally thought to sell better than the same game with zero discount at 40$. However too high a discount can give the opposite effect of making the product seem defective or discounted because it's not worth full price. It's a balancing act, but marketing has had to come a long way since the Henry Ford Era where consumers didn't have a lot of choice.",

For a paid game, its great. They released it for free on steam where anyone could review it, so flavor of the week gamers who might hate this type of game ended up reviewing it. If they had kept it behind a paywall, only people who like this specific genre of game wouldve committed and bought it, and ultimately wouldve been satisfied. They try to do paid AND free (which was a watered down version) and it just made the free players angry. \n\nEven though its completely free! So yeah.

I'll give you a real life example, my brother owns a traditional small restaurant in our area, a mere ~0.25$ difference (3-10$ meals) from our competitors caused the \"low value crowd\" to burst at the seams with anger 💢 \"how dare you charge so much I'll go next door for 100fils less!\" AND THEY ACTUALLY DID, and since then what happened? No more random self entitled level of complaints, way more polite customers, and largely well praised for quality of food and the irony, the value.\n\nWhat happened was that tiny difference was enough to completely change the economic and social background of the customer base.\n\nChances are, you might be attracting younger learners, even children, when you make it free versus paid, because an adult is a lot more likely to value their time enough to pay for a quality course that helps them learn something a lot faster than if they were to self learn it \"for free\". Whereas a kid wouldn't care so much about the time factor and would care more about you being entertaining to watch, which might be a difficult thing to do if they're comparing you to Youtubers and such. You could also be having a case of completely different countries' citizens being your audience at free.\n\nMy advice is to tailor your offers to the target audience you wish to retain, a free offer might sound more enticing in your head than 25% off or giving some thank-you perk with the course or such, but if it's changing the demographic of who's becoming your student then it's useless if not damaging advertising. Large corporations cater to different audiences by creating different product lines for each, not by muddying the one line trying to make it fit them all.",

I've spoken and worked with a lot of people who do small scale, local work, in particular a piano instructor of mine was willing to talk about how he decides what to charge. The universal truth is you have to meet people's expectations, and they have certain expectations at certain price points. \n\n\nThe developers of the game Peak did a statement talking about how they came up with the price of the game and it actually is a good analysis of what a consumer thinks when seeing price points. Being free does have an ironic expectation nowadays to be able to buy some micro transactions to fix something you don't like about a product. However don't forget bots are plentiful out there, it may seem unlikely but review bombing to tarnish competitors is still a thing, just like review bloating (bots spamming good reviews, don't know the technical term) is a thing. Being free does unfortunately invite that kind of traffic.",

Get nothing done. \n\nI guess another would be a game you didn't like but want to finish. For me was god of war 3. The game was not fun. Was just brutal visuals. And cool cutscenes. That was mainly it. Had stupid hard puzzles, like why does a brawler game have puzzles??? Combat was spam triangle -_- I changed the difficulty cuz it was so boring. The fantasy was cool, I'm not arguing that, but the gameplay itself was a lot of nothing 😅 I could not wait to finish it. I was also very sad that my young cousin saw me play it and started crying. I tried to keep him away from seeing it he snuck inside. Game were just so much better in PlayStation 2. PS3 just started to be all about graphics but no gameplay",

If the game was free then there is no incentive to stick with it to get past that wall of content. If you already paid for it, you are more likely to push through so as not to waste your money.\n\nImagine getting the entire works of Agatha Christie as a gift. Being given each book one by one year after year would be fine but getting the whole lot in one go? That's a lot of reading ahead. If you had bought it for yourself then you went in knowing what you were signing up for but as a gift? Where do you start? Do you even like her books? Do you like them enough to read the whole set or do you try one and decide it's just too much and give up?\n\nI would never give a negative review over something like this but I understand why people might object to it even if I don't believe they should give a negative review for such a reason as the issue is in their head rather than with the product itself.",

You have so many takes, and subgenres of it, idlers that are simple and just look nice, puzzle games where you have to figure out the best synergies, spreadsheet simulators where you spend 20 hours to eke out 0.5% efficiency gain...\n\nSteam probably shows this game to people that already play idlers, and they have much higher and more specific expectations than the person who has never played cookie clicker before.",

          "text": "Hey! I'm quite a critic on idle and incremental games. They're a very special niche; let's see why:\n\n>Reviews call the gameplay slow, shallow, and uninspired. \n\nMost idle/incrementals are like that. Creating a good, non-repetitive idle game is hard. It's not about adding upgrades, do some maths, and call it a day. FWIW, even famous idles like Cookie Clicker are shallow, and would have worse reviews if it wasn't for _Orteil_, its art, storytelling and release date.\n\n>Feedback from the beta testers (after updates) was the opposite... they found it satisfying and enjoyed the unique engagement mechanics and abilities.\n\nThat's good, but don't create a wat between beta testers and normal players. Both are valuable, and none is more right than the other. Understand both, and if your beta-testers are friends or something, _caution_.\n\n>when people spend eight hours playing then leave their first ever game review just to say my game is bland\n\nIt's an idle/incremental. Most idles can't be reviewed after just 1 hour of gameplay. So don't read roo much into that \"8h\". 8h for your game is 1h for a graphical adventure.\n\n>Or feel entitled to it being free. I spent over 1,100 hours on this and it's less than $4\n\nEntitleness is probably not the word. If some review said that, look at it in a constructive way: many simple incrementals are free. It's just how things are. And it doesn't mean yours have to be. But players will compare anyway. $4 looks good for a normal incremental IMO, but it depends on the specifics of course.\n\nAlso: The time it took to make the game means nothing, remember this.\n\n>especially after the positive feedback from reddit and the testers\n\nWell, consider that \"Mixed\" reviews isn't good, but it isn't terrible. People liked it. And there are always more players than reviewers.\n\nNow, to give you some personal ideas around incrementals, I usually categorize incrementals like:\n- Plain incrementals: Simple repetitive loop. They look good for 20 minutes, then it's the same with bigger numbers. Worst ones; I'll usually add a negative review there, _whatever the price_ (You're not _entitled_ to better reviews even if it's cheap or free!). For example, Time Clickers could fall here, even if it could be in the next step. But it does some things very wrong\n- Normal incrementals: There's a more hand-crafted loop, some more content, but it's still the same mechanic. Cookie Clickers or Clicker Heroes are good examples. They're basic equation solvers, but they have some content where you can waste some time\n- Good incrementals: The kind of game I'll never forget. Incrementals that are _not_ numeric loops. They add mechanics out of the incremental meta, and integrate them nicely. Some examples being Melvor Idle (More idle than incremental), Gnorp Apologue or Leafblower Simulator. They are top tier incrementals I 100% recommend playing to understand the psychology behind the genre. Because they're, in different ways, amazing. And you can 100% complete Gnorp in some hours. But I will pay for it double of what I would pay for a 1000h-length generic incremental.",

It probably wouldn't have succeeded to the same extent if it were an unknown releasing today where expectations for incremental games are higher. \n\nThat might be part of my problem. I took a unique mechanic (automatic idle snakes) gave it a unique hook (clicking/dragging on the screen calls food to the snakes), but then gave it a linear upgrade system where you basically just purchase the next available upgrade that you can afford. No math required, no build variety. I'm really proud of the mechanic, but it feels like it's being held back by the lack of depth. \n\nI actually thought about Gnorp Apologue a lot during development. I really felt like my original idea would put it into the same vein as Gnorp and Tower Wizard. I couldn't find a single other automatic Snake-like game on Steam. Feels like wasted potential now...",

                  "text": "As a consumer of idle and incremental games (not a dev), I wouldn't call \"automatic snakes\" your unique mechanic. That's your theme or skin and is probably the least interesting component mechanically--and I don't mean that to shit on your creative effort--but it could be caterpillars, slime molds, trains, spaceships, conga dance lines, or stars collecting planets and the underlying way the player interacts with the screen would be the same.\n\n\nClick/dragging is a mechanic, but is it really different from most idle mechanics, where active play can be used for higher short term earnings/sec. Like, for how the mechanics affect what actions someone is taking, or the choices it presents, how are your snakes different than drone+manual tapping in obelisk miner?\n\n\nFor unique hooks or mechanics, I think of something like Kittens, where taking some research paths blocks other upgrades. Or how terraformential has a rogue-like puzzle component to it that makes each \"prestige\" functionally different and not just \"numbers go up\". Or there was one I forget the name of where you chose skills to boost either idle or active play until the next prestige.\n\n\nFrom just watching the video, I would say the thing that attracted me most was the hypnotizing visuals of the snakes moving around. I would like to see you explore THAT as your unique hook. Can you upgrade different movement patterns? Extra visuals? Pulsing colors or lights?\n\n\nAny way, congratulations on your release! You've got something solid. But just need dig a bit more into what is resonating with people and expand on that.",

Different people like different games, and fans of fast paced action rpgs probably won’t enjoy your slow idle game, no matter how good it is, because that’s just not their niche. \n\nThat’s fine and not something you can change, but if 45% of your players are the wrong crowd, you should look into how that happened. Did you bundle it with the wrong game? Did your trailer suggest it’s more action packed than it is? SOMETHING probably made people who are not the idler crowd buy your game and then it’s no wonder that they didn’t like it.

That means you're close, you're just not 100% there yet.\n\nLooking at the steam page and reviews, most of these sound reasonable so there's probably some good information and feedback to mine here. Like it or not, things like prestige mechanics and unlock progression are expected in incremental/idle games. I don't think you need a hundred layers of different mechanics, but enough that someone could see something new every 10-20 minutes for about 2 hours at least. \n\nI don't know what's present now without playing it myself, but broadly players need new goals that unlock new things. Prestige once, get a flat multiplier. Prestige 3 times, trade in points to unlock challenges. Complete challenges to add a new food type, etc. Egg inc and revolution idle would be great comparison points.\n\nI think the general play area presentation is spot on, no notes. It's cool watching the snakes run around and the mess of numbers.\n\nThe UI on the right needs some work. A bit more conveyance (darken button when you don't have enough money) and more definition to the buttons themselves perhaps. RGB color scheme with buttons shaded on all sides comes across as really default. The link below has some good examples- directional lighting artifacts, heavy bottom shading to sell 3d depth, unique borders, etc.\n\nhttps://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/buttons-set-211824?srsltid=AfmBOopNNgjuwcda5urr2MY5yObp_wcQvOp0TovmJSU0SEE1c7wTTER9\n\nAgain, you're close! People want to like this game or they wouldn't be leaving reviews. Push a bit further, add some additional features, regroup. When you finish the new features, make a community post inviting people to try v1.1 but wait until you're confident you've crossed that 2+ hour mark so you don't burn good will.",

You made a slow meditative incremental idler and some players are complaining that it is slow and predictable, which just means they were not the target audience. Eight hours played and then saying it is not worth it still means the core loop held their attention hence beta testers and Reddit feedback are biased toward the genre and toward you the general store audience is harsher and compares your game to everything they have ever played and spending 1100 hours does not entitle a game to praise because players review experience not effort. Early reviews are usually the harshest because dissatisfied players speak first while okay or mildly satisfied players stay silent. If multiple people call it shallow or generic that is not negative criticism it is usable design information. The only real mistake would be taking it personally or ignoring repeated criticism.

Sure, it sucks to have something you thought was awesome getting mixed reviews, but it's all feedback and that's not bad.\n\nTangentially, if the public reception is this wildly different from the tester reception, I think you've probably got a bigger disconnect going on here.

Long story short, at the end of the book he finishes the race in last place and, while he is hard on himself about it, his friend points out that there are a lot of trucks that flipped over or otherwise didn't even make it to the end of the race. His hero pulls up next to him and praises him for having gumption and pulling through to the finisb. Everybody else stood out in the spotlight, but his superpower was fighting through to the end no matter what obstacles he faced.\n\nI have started developing several games and have not even come close to ANYTHING shippable or even playable. I saw the obstacles that looked like they were going to prevent me from shipping the end result I was imagining and (partially due to ADD) moved on to the next thing.\n\nYou might not have finished with the result you were hoping for, but MANY people before you haven't even finished the race at all. You are way ahead of most people who aspire to release a game and if you have gotten this far, you have something special. I don't know if you will ever be successful as an indie dev, but I know you won't be if you count this as a loss rather than the very reall win it is.

If you meet peoples expectations, they will leave a positive review, if not, negative, even if the game is good, just not what they expected.\n\nMaybe your marketing or other games in the genre gave players wrong expectations for what the game is?

          "text": "I very much know the feeling.\n\nI released back in November -- and have done ok (\\~75% positive with 90 reviews), but definitely see the red thumbs more clearly.\n\nCouple suggestions.\n\n1. You can't please everybody, people are prone to deciding what a game should be before they even play it, and if it doesn't fit the rigid idea they've formed, they get upset.\n\nYou can't fix this, but making the trailers and description as accurate as possible may help. \n\n2. Read the reviews with a critical (but not defensive) eye. A lot of negativity in reviews is not exactly in good faith. (i.e. they complain about performance when running a pc with less than half of the minimum specs, or they're upset that a game specifically marketing as a slow paced trading game is a slow paced trading game instead of the first person shooter they wanted.) \n\nThat said, there can be a whole slew of complaints that you are developer-blind to, and it can be very worth making efforts to address these complaints.\n\nImportantly, if you do respond to a review -- be polite, non-defensive, and earnest. Don't respond at all to people with nothing actionable to say.\n\n3. Get as many hands on the project as you can - before asking for their money. My game for example launched in a pretty rough state, despite having a playable demo out for more than a year prior to release. I can't even imagine how much worse it would have been had it just been me testing things out on 1 or 2 machines.\n\nAlso - having a demo may well insulate you from \\*some\\* of the negativity, as people who are immediately disinterested are less likely to buy refund and review.\n\nIf you've got eyes on the project, run betas/etc prior to release if you can.\n\nLastly - looking at your game things aren't dire. Many of the negative reviews list positive features, and the general feeling is that the game doesn't scale much for an idler game and has minimal content, with some even acknowledging that the game could get better over time.\n\nImo responding gracefully, (and publicly), with your intentions to address criticism/add content/etc -- may well turn things around.",

Obviously all of us artists wish that our art was received by everyone as well as we like it ourselves. The irony however is that we are also our worst critics. So when we are actually happy with our work, it can be that much more hurtful when there are worse critics than ourselves.\n\nSo yeah, in my experience that pain will never go away, although it may very well subside substantially. I’m currently playing God of war Ragnarok and Kratos Frequently reminds me to not let my feelings affect me negatively but to harness them into positive action.

Life growing up may have been incredibly cruel, they may have felt like an outsider or undeserving of even being in the same class as fellow students who they thought made much better art. And honestly, the “first official work“ that was released to rave reviews most certainly wasn’t actually their first release work. They may have gotten negative feedback on their art in art school by their fellow students or teachers or advisors. Maybe everyone liked it except the one person who is opinion really mattered to them like their spouse or parent.\n\nThere are a lot of moving parts in the world of art, and sadly I feel like those moving parts tip the scales negatively in our favor almost all of the time. It’s always a struggle, it’s always an uphill battle. another thing I have taken to heart for so long as a filmmaker was when someone framed the way to be a successful filmmaker to be literally obsessed with it. You have to be obsessed to make films because the road is so rough. All the rejection, all of the problems, the costs, the time… Any other person would give up immediately. So you have to be obsessed with your art to be an artist.",

But from the reviews, it seems like it lacks a lot in progression. It is still a game, and therefore does need progression to some degree, even if it's slow. \n\nIf I could recommend, I would suggest making a lot of the unlocks locked behind progression, add some more content with progression, and slowly expand the map, and maybe even play on the idea of planets and galaxies since you're in space. Just some ideas. It has a lot of potential as a game for sure, so definitely just take the reviews as criticism. Remember, they paid money and gave your game time. Negative review or not, they tried it out, and therefore your game has potential at face value.\n\nGood luck!",

Yet, it's also an opportunity to learn how others interpret your design, data, framing, interpretation, etc. It definitely stings, but the fact that you completed something compelling enough for people to spend time and money on it is a great accomplishment. There's a lot of stuff out there (great and garbage) that people never discover. You did enough things right to intrigue people to buy and play it. Also, it's still early. You just released it and reviews are just like any other type of data -- unstable at small sample sizes. If it's still mixed when you have 10x the number of reviews you have now, then that is more telling than your current reviews. \n\nAlso, some games aren't always as great as they could become at the initial release... some devs just want to get something out, get a feel for what players like/dislike, and then transform it into a better version of what they originally intended. \n\nI know nothing about your game or you (other than what is in your post), but I think it's rad you had an idea, built the game, and released it. That's more than most ever do, and your game might be totally awesome. It's just too early to tell and there's a lot to celebrate already.

Good start.\n\n-It looks very lovely - my partner walked into the room while it was on my screen and went \"oooh, what's that? Link it to me\"\n\n-It promises to be fairly short (which is good for me, my favourite game of the last few months was Execute, which was a £5 four-hour game with a great idea that got in and out quickly and didn't waste my time. Love it). You aren't hiding the 100% achievement completion behind thousands of hours of pointless repetition like some idle games.\n\nBad:\n\n-Your priorities seem to be in very strange places, which come across as very inexperienced - for example, why do you have a playable piano when your upgrades aren't greyed out when the player can't afford them? \n\n-You have a prestige mechanic hidden in a strange place which seems to be quite half-baked?\n\nAs I said, I've played 4 hours, at this point I'm fairly content to just leave it as a wallpaper on my third screen occasionally clicking back in order to work on the task list, there doesn't feel like an incentive to do any more, and the very little interaction the game does have requires me to look closer at the game to figure out what I can/can't afford. \n\nI had fun with it, and I don't regret the purchase. I will try to remember to leave a positive review to help out once I 100% it. It's a perfectly fine first attempt, so many people do so much worse and never get better. Stick with it.",

Way too many variables to even start to worry about.\nOne example being half-life. But those are so ultra rare that it even overshadowed bunch of legendary games of its time.\nAnd the devs were seasoned already to begin with, just in different program type :p\n\nNever chase the high, we humans often focus too much on that. It's normal and okay, but not the way when it's too big of a focus. Too much of anything can be bad anyway.\n\nYou are doing well, don't worry about it! And you are allowed to feel bummed about it too, but also definitely should feel bunch of positive feelings from the good things you learned and did through it(as many pointed out)!\n\n55% is awesome especially with that amount of reviews! Also, hopefully one of your future projects will be even more enjoyed by whoever wants to enjoy them! I sometimes find some games that have like 98% rate and i couldn't care less, cuz they aren't for me and so i don't even try them because id not like it.

It's okay that the pacing is slow but it doesn't really feel like any signifigant depth opens up as you play. Even as a relaxed idler it feels shallow. For games I'm usually aiming for $1-2/hrs of enjoyment. For an idler I'd expect more hours because my play itself is more dilute and hands off. I think this game falls short of that. The game has neat visuals but I feel with the current complexity it would be hard to justify buying this versus any other free more involved idle game. As a player keep in mind I don't get to see the 1000 hours of effort that went in, all I see is the final product.\n\n\nEven though it is a zen and relaxing game, that doesn't mean it needs to lack complexity or meta progression. I think that is the biggest disconnect between you and your more critical reviews.\n\n\nThis review might sound a little harsh but I'm just trying to be honest to help with your next game.

Moving on to another game is always one of the most difficult decisions for me because I know I am usually making a 1-3 year commitment to have a game running on my computer 99% of the time. For me, idle games should be low in graphics and be pleasant to have up on my screen for the entire duration. I specifically target incremental games like yours, but if I were looking for a new game right now, I wouldn’t choose it because it appears to be too graphicly intensive. If you want some examples of successful incremental games, look at NGU Idle, Trimps, and Melvor Idle as examples of a game someone will want to keep up all of the time. \n\nI hope you have great success in your game dev endeavors however and I hope your game becomes the next big thing.

People want more prestige levels, they want more snakes, they want their upgrades to feel like they matter. They dont want a faster beefier game, but they want to be able to play it instead of having it as a screensaver.\n\n\nAlso, I haven't played your game.

What I read from those comments (as an objective eye) is that they were excited about the game from what they saw in the trailer (like me) but when it came to playing, they felt very passive. So what I infer from that, is that you took \"idler\" a bit to literal and didn't give them too much agency on the game. And if you remember the flow chart, if you don't have even a little challenge (or at least the illusion of a challenge, as one commentor said) you fall into boredom. I kinda agree with you, that people should relax a bit with a 4 Dollar game. But at the same time, to them it feels like they paid 4 dollars for a glorified screen saver. In the end, an idler game, should still be a game. (I haven't played it, so I don't know if that is a valid point, but that's what I read from the comments)\n\nAlso, congratulations for getting so many reviews in so little time.

          "text": "Ah, I'm sorry that's happening. My suggestion is to try to make the best of it though. Make sure you read the reviews and see what people are criticising. If there's room for improvement in your game and the reviews are giving constructive criticism, maybe work toward implementing fixes/improvements into an update.\n\nThere are major big budget games that have released with terrible average review scores, and they've spent time updating their games and fixing things, and eventually completely turned things around and now get raving reviews about how great the games are. No Man's Sky is a perfect example of that.\n\nDon't get discouraged. I think it's awesome that you were able to release your game after working on it for so long. It's great that you actually have a game finished and released and out there for people to buy. It's something to be proud of, and if there is room for improvement in your game and you can take the constructive criticism and turn it into something even better, it could be a great opportunity. Now that the game is finished and playable, working on some updates and new content for it would be a great way to bring more attention to your game and change people's opinions on it.\n\nDon't underestimate how valuable your updates will be once the people who bought your game see you working on it. Gamers have a ton of respect for developers that actually take their comments and criticisms to heart and turn them into updates in the games. Having a customer see their suggestion put into a game is awesome and makes your players feel like they're being heard and listened to, and can really turn things around.\n\nUpdate: I was curious, so I went out and read some of the negative reviews. Honestly, there is some actual constructive criticism in these, so you might be able to turn some of these into a positive. If you do decide to make some changes and push an update, make sure you go to the negative review that inspired it, and post a comment in response to the player, so they know that you made an update based on their feedback.",

I didn't hate my time with this game, but it also did not really feel like much of an experience either. It's pretty, it's streamlined, it runs well, but you don't ever do anything new and, strictly speaking, you don't do anything at all except occasionally upgrade a thing. That loosely describes most idle / incremental games, but there is usually some illusion of choice or direction, some incentive to look and pay attention. That does not exist here. Maybe worth a couple dollars for something you have in the background for a day.\n\nSo, first off, that's not actually negative as they say it's generally more neutral. 55% being mixed reviews reflects a similar level of neutral to me so that's something.\n\nYou may have set out to simply make this without much to do, or you just weren't sure what all could go into it to make it feel more interesting without betraying that calm slow meditative take. That said, I do think it's important to give people something to do even in games that may on their surface be against that premise. Definitely spend time in the space you want your game to live within and see what does well and what doesn't. Also, when conducting testing research you need to come at it knowing people can be more positive when they know they're talking to the developer and are being asked to test things vs having spent money on something and being able to recommend that to other players and not be giving feedback to developers. Also, you need to remember to ask questions that can help guide what you should be doing. If someone says the game is relaxing and cute, for example, you need to probe around what it may be lacking, whether or not they would feel compelled to play this for longer than 10-15 minutes, what it feels like compared to other games in the genre/approach. Market research is tough, and there's a reason people spend a LOT of money and time conducting it properly. That's not accessible for a lot of indie devs, so remember to try and push people when you have them and get what you can out of it.\n\nNow the question is, do you iterate on this game and try to add things or tweak things based on what the responses are saying, or do you take it to heart and move on to your next game. Either way, congratulations on getting a game out there that people have played enough to leave reviews for! So many just fall into obscurity.",

If nothing else you now know that you can at least make something that is marketable. \n\nAlso right now on the store page you're sitting at 69% positive, which again for a first game is pretty great. You said in another comment that half of your beta testers are friends or people you know and I think that was the issue. You need people who aren't afraid to nitpick everything about your game.

I'm not sure what that means in context but it sounds like it breaks the main gameplay loop.\n\nSome other comments are saying that this is a marketing issue, that the wrong people are finding your game.

          "text": "Hi u/OldAtlasGames, just had a quick look at the reviews and at least they seem to give great feedback. Combined with all the great replies you have that seems to be a great start for a potential next step that could be adjusting the game to the reviewers expectations if you like. \n\nIf you'd like to try and do something like this I may - albeit I say this as a gamer, not a professional - change the games description to add a big fat update notice on top that says that you've listened and changed these and those points to improve the game and make it more exciting or sth. along those lines.\n\nAt the same time I'd place a discount that lowers the price to sth. like just 1$. So low, people may simply buy it because why not. This has multiple advantages: You show up in the list of heavily discounted games, reching a wider steam audience. You get more sales and reviews, every single gamer may recommend your game. The expectations for a game that is just 1$ are way lower than those for a 4$ game. Ideally reviews may say that they'd even buy it for those 4$. Once you have reached that level, you may end the discount and see how income and reviews develop from there.\n\n\\------------\n\nWhat you could also ask yourself for future ventures is why the beta testers and the steam clients view the game that differently. Biggest question you could ask yourself here is: Who were the beta testers? Were they friends? Always a bad idea. They most likely tend to rate your work more favourably than internet randos. I would too, simply because I'm already excited that my friend has made something cool. I want it to be cool, because you are my friend. Hence I'll potentially look over lots of potential issues that others see more clearly.\n\nOr were they perhaps random fans your game gathered during the development phase? That may come with similar issues.\n\n\\-------------\n\nThis too reminds me of an episode of the TV series \"Silicon Valley\" that is loosely inspired by real-life events. There the protagonists do a closed beta for their app and get overwhelmingly positive feedback. Then their VC associate tests it and is not exactly excited. They launch and fail miserably: Nobody gets the app. Turns out their mistake was that they exclusively invited friends from software engineering and didn't realize that a trained engineering brain has an easier time navigating their to others rather convoluted UX than random B2C users. Oops.\n\nAlways try to get beta testers who are closest to actual potential buyers. Easier said than done of course. The game looks definitely pretty cool and I'm tempted to give it a try, even if it's just for the sake of supporting your ventures a tiny little bit :) Have fun, don't let this first experience draw you down, see it as helpful feedback to improve or well, change to cater towards your gamers & furthermost: Keep it up, enjoy your great venture!",

Maybe a pacing/balance pass would help alot. With idlers/incremental, oftentimes make things less convenient than you think they should be at first so \"baseline\" game loop feels like an upgrade. \n\nI dont think your game is cooked at all, try and update, tell people you have listened to their feedback, and see where it goes. If it is cheap to gate or add content, do a bit of that and market it as 1.1. \n\nDude, 20 reviews already puts you well into the top half of steam AND you shipped a cool looking little game. Be proud of yourself, take the feedback, and apply it to your next title after you're done updating this one. You've already proven you are a gamedev, just have to improve the craft. \n\nGood job and I'll be purchasing and leaving a good review.",

Show up a few more times and then make sure to pop into a few more streams afterwards. If you can, make it a habit of popping in occasionally when they stream. Don’t just be a “one and done” person cause even if they let you drop your game, they won’t shout you out when you’re not there unless they like you. You wanna aim for steamers around a few thousand followers or more. Small enough to talk to but big enough where they’re clearly taking it seriously. Make it a daily habit to find a new steamer or interact with someone you’ve already met. Make sure their friend streamers get to know you as well. Make sure you keep looking for streamers outside of their friend group as well otherwise you’ll get promoted to the same audience over and over and over cause a lot of streamers have the same fan base as their friends.",

At this size, for designing the initial sprite the price is 45€, and for the animation I take 10€per frame, this is a 12 frames loop, so 120€. Or a total of 165€. Ideally this would have took me 8 hours to make, but it took me a bit more because I wanted to polish the sprite.\n\nI try to aim at an hourly wage of 20€/h for commissions, but my last contractual position at a company, which was part time, I was being paid 16€/h (as a freelancer, not salary).\n\nPixel artist with more experience can charge more than this, up to 100€/h.",

For one, they're still carrying burden of proof that they're \"legit\" on top of, you know, working extensively the old way.\n\nAnd another thing is illustrated by this very post: an artist who made hand-drawn images for a video game got fucked over and lost their contribution to oblivion not because of AI, but because of a bunch of morons who think they're \"pro real art\" and who the devs thought they had no choice but to bend over for.",

I would advice taking it all to a more cartoony/realistic style whichever fits better, and I would remove the gradient on the title which would make the inconsistency less prevalent.\n\nThe new banner is so much better by the way, the cat no longer looks like a 3d model and it has so much life, as a fan of puzzle games this looks super interesting!\n\nAs a final opinion, I think you don't need the \"cat\" on the title, as I think it is already pretty self explanatory and it just makes it longer",

The latest update brought full comfortable gamepad support, and I have around 10% of players playing on the steam deck, so I'd say the game is definitely playable with it.\n\nSteam gave it the Playable Tag instead of Verified because they said that some texts are too small to be read comfortably in handheld mode. They cited two specific places, one of those is a flavor text on the map that is not needed for gameplay, and the other is text on some cards in a very specific location that is size 10 instead of the minimum 11 if I remember correctly. Anyway, that would have been too bothersome for me to change since I would need to redo the whole UI so I decided to keep it that way.\n\nIf you want, you can try the demo, see if those text sizes bother you, and buy the full game if you are ok with it! The demo does not have full controller support though so you'll have to navigate with the track pad if you want to do so.",

There are more things like domain modelling (and implementing it), design patterns, OOP (or any other paradigm you use), or software architecture in general.\n\nFor example: why would you need such a variable? Looks like a code smell, suggesting that the issue lies somewhere else, and the need for something like this one is just an unfortunate side effect. Now you can comment it (duct tape fix) or redesign your code.\n\nPersonally, I think that in-line comments are ok only if your code is hard to read by design - like complex math or not-human-readable algorithms. In such cases, it should be encapsulated into a black box that you won't touch too often, along with the inline comments.\n\nTop-level documentation, on the other hand, may be useful to introduce new devs. If needed.\n\nSometimes when I worked on team projects, and I had a requirement to document everything, my docs were mostly the same as the methods/functions/classes signatures because there was no need to add more info.",

It stands out better, and more importantly will stand out muuuuch more on the Steam store than the old one because plenty of games have hills, grass, trees, blue sky and clouds in the background. Could have the dice be more visible in it, and have a thicker outline on the logo to make it stand out. I would also suggest making one “Die” in the logo look different from the other (be it colour or incorporating dice colours for one of them) so it makes it more obvious it’s not talking about the same use of the word twice. \n\nOtherwise I really like it and would check the game out if I saw it on Steam :)",

The colours pop without screaming “look at me!”, the dynamic poses look much better and show some real artistic skill. Is it busy? Yes. But I get the feeling that’s intentional to show the feel or energy of the game. And if it’s legible on a fraction of a phone screen it’ll be fine on a handheld pc or TVs/monitors as long as the logo doesn’t blend into the background, which I think either a thicker outline, or better yet, an slightly angular background to it.\n\n… so as you probably noticed, I wrote this out and decided to quickly doodle (on my phone via my finger lol) what changes I’d make. I’d mayyybe make the border around the logo even thicker than this, but I’m not sure, and I’ve added a couple more dice closer to where eyes are naturally drawn to, to make the dice aspect more noticeable.\n\nI’d recommend playing around with any ideas that stood out to you that everyone has suggested though! It’s your art! :)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jpoe2gc9hofg1.jpeg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be77d00bb34ef3c26f490146d3ce29d11494e985",

It may not look like much, but every technical subsystem that needs to be specialized is written for the target platform: achievements, session management, persistence, keyboard input, etc.\n\nThe other big reason is that this is our fourth game and we’re starting from an infrastructure framework that we’ve built over time. One of the biggest parts is the system that lets us write data to Google spreadsheets and automatically get all the data organized into ScriptableObjects in Unity. It’s a pretty complex system that we’ve been carrying around since our second game.\n\nAnother very large part is the automated testing system, our custom internal localization system, and lots of small tools that help us during development.\n\nSo in short, most of the project doesn’t even get compiled into the final game, it’s there to support the development pipeline or to handle other platforms.",

Thank you so much.  \nI just put the samples on a very very low number (I use maya + Arnold) and then I use a toon shader and lights to exagerate highlights and make sure the shape of the character is readable with low sampling. \n\nI then place a rotating camera around the character and render each frame.\n\nI use a free software called \"glue it\" that creates the spritesheets out of the renders. That's pretty much it for these rotating gifs. \n\nFor the game is way more complex because the you can swap the arms, head, chest and legs of the character, so for that we render every limb separately in all poses and that generates a ton of sprites. I export them as PSB files and add bones in unity. It's a bit of a nightmare but after a bunch of characters is just a repetitive process!",

It's just simply a lot more effort than \"put an exit button here and call it a day\".",

Each one registers a set of \"Services\" to the application/game object.  \n\nFrom within TerrainManager:\n\n    game.register(\"getTerrainHeightAt\", (x, y) => { .... });\n\nthen any other class can just say \n\n    game.call(\"getTerrainHeightAt\", x, y);\n\nthen you can just add and remove systems easily without having to update references everywhere.  also your classes can handle the case when the call returns null/undefined and not care whether or not the other class exists.\n\nthis allows you to make re-usable systems across multiple applications because they are self contained systems that dont care about the rest of the application.",

Days by days I see game developers don't know how to make game for gamers (including yours). That's because they're making a copycat instead of solving the problem. If you play Stardew Valley and Expedition 33, both of them save the problem that video game in that genre had (stardew valley solved farming simulator problem, and Expedition 33 solved turn based RPG problem. Meanwhile yours just copycat, like it just \"another Flappy Bird\" clone. But your game is just another Assassin Creed. Your game DOES NOT solve anything stealth game had. Your game is just action game with stealth feature, not a stealth game. There is no hook. That's my 2 cents. Anyway, I play stealth game since '98",

You play as a grounded take on Red Riding Hood, raised by the Huntsman who saved her in an ancient, shared fairytale world that doesn’t care about you.\n\nGameplay-wise, we focus heavily on feel: movement, archery, melee, stealth, and encounters that react to how you approach them rather than forcing one solution (a lot of what my post talks about is us throwing work away to get that right).\n\nStory is character-driven but unfolds slowly through the world rather than big exposition dumps. You’re not saving the world out of the gate, you’re just trying to survive it, and then bigger consequences emerge over time based on how you play.\n\nTargeting release on Steam (PC & Mac, PS5, Xbox, and Switch 2).

You have to live it.\n\nAs former AAA dev who worked on big action rpg franchise, when I saw your pitch I was like: \"damn I'm not sure you know what you are signing for sir but that’s a nice pitch for sure\" .\nHappy to see the roads you travelled so far. \n\nWish you the best for the next steps.",

I like that even with that success you weren’t complacent and wanted to go a step further and challenge yourself with making a game.

I went to college and got a medical degree but I’m currently working a 9-5 that I just don’t enjoy. I REALLY want independence and financial success from my own ideas. I can’t stop thinking about wanting to make my own indie game but I know it will be a bigger undertaking than I realize. I would say my idea is less ambitious than your game because it’s a sidescroller like Limbo and Inside…so that gives me some hope that I CAN pull this dream off. I am self taught in everything I do. I never give up when I try difficult things. My plan is to just do lots of research and make sure I tackle the development in the right order and learn as efficiently as I can while I move forward. Do you think I can pull off an indie game like Limbo or Inside?\n\nI wish you all the luck and success in your game Tale’s Edge!",

Via my experience, 99% of Reddit is that.\n\nA Steam game published with negative reviews isn’t exactly a dis-qualifying resume. A number of devs have lousy Steam reviews, but have great talent; they just didn’t have a great idea or popular game.\n\nYour experience sounds a lot like mine. I spent a year trying to get a multiplayer game going with “salesmen” devs, only to get examples and demos, but nothing advancing my game. \n\nI luckily/accidentally found a dev who was a 15 year Unity multiplayer dev with a busted early access game who delivered in a week, what the “Salesmen” devs couldn’t do in a year. \n\nIt’s amazing what you can find if you know what to look for. You need recommendations, I can refer some to you.  They do in a week what “salesmen” devs take months. They don’t BS, they deliver. If you are sitting around waiting for progress.

Most likely the dev was stuck because of your other issues with a lack of direction.  Hindsight is 20/20, and a new dev coming in has a much better foundation to work from than the first one who was prototyping constantly.\n\nMost people hire from AAA talent because they think the finished games on their resume are more of an accomplishment than someone with a long running game.  The reality is most devs in AAA had a small part of the process.  Not saying that’s what you replaced them with, just that it’s a common pitfall and usually what a PM like yourself would react with.\n\nIt’s an interesting read overall, but I think your analysis of the situations shows you still have a lot more to learn.  It’s a good thing you come from money, because it’s going to be an expensive learning experience.  Good luck, and I look forward to reading more in the future to see how you grow as a PM.",

EVERYTHING... you can't ask most teenagers to write so much as a paragraph, without six sample sentences, a template they can use, speech to text accomodations in case they cant type, a few exemplars they can just imitate directly, and a picture of a sentence on the wall, so they can remember what one looks like if they forget. You have to hold their hand from the moment they walk in the door, to the moment you and their mom strap them in to their highschooler-sized carseats and send them home again.  \n  \nIf you hand a kid homework, they sick their parents on you, and now you're a 'bad' teacher, because their 15 year old (who still refuses to even ATTEMPT work involving fractions or decimals, but is still somehow in AP classes) feels anxious and overwhelmed by the ten to twenty problems you sent home with them. If they cant solve it, its your fault as the teacher for not supplying them with a single, magic cheatsheet they can follow to complete every problem they could possibly run into, their entire lives. If you expect a kid to TRY or EXERT EFFORT in order to succeed, you are already on your way to being fired, because thats not fair to these poor, poor kids.\n\nHonestly, I dont personally think AI is gonna take over or anything like that... but these kids better hope it does. If they have to grow up and be responsible for their own lives, they'll starve. I spend every day trying my damnedest to get them to understand that they are, sooner or later, going to have to feed, clothe, and care for THEMSELVES, and they just do not believe that it is true... its always someone elses job to solve their problems for them.  \n  \n And no, you dont sound bitter, you sound level headed and mildly annoyed... \\*I\\* sound bitter, lol.",
