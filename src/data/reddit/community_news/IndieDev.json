You can spend 10 years making a game, but if no one likes it, the problem isn't that you worked hard. The problem is you didn't provide any value.\n\nIt's like spending 10 years digging a hole in the middle of the forest and expecting people to celebrate. No one gives a fuck if you spent 10 years digging a hole. Yeah, it's a lot of effort. It's a LOT of hard work. But people only care about what value you provide for them. \n\nOne of the biggest examples I use in the art community is that no one cares if you draw a picture of your cat. But they will care if you use your skills to draw a picture of their cat. Clients don't want art of you. They want art of themselves. \n\nIf you want to sell a product, you have to provide value that the customer wants. Not value that you want. If you want the praise from the internet, give value to the internet.\n\n\\------\n\nThere's nothing wrong with making a product you want that you like. But keep in mind that the validation has to come from yourself and from inside. Make it for you. Enjoy that you made it. Don't get entitled to adoration from strangers when you did it for yourself. \n\nBe proud of your hole in the forest - for you. Don't expect others to care. You did it for you, not them.",

          "text": "I like them both, but I also think the shift in style could be really cool intentional effect. Like they are disinterested at first, and then take a more menacing stance in the second. Having said that, I think the first has more personality. The additional teeth doesn't really make any of them seem \"scarier\" or anything to me, but it *definitely* makes the one on the far left seem kinda... I dunno. He went from disinterested to looking like he's interested in the smell of his own farts, and I can't really explain why. Something about the jawline shape sorta reminds me of how goofy stupid children get drawn in like, that gross out animation/art style that was popular in the 90s? They are cool both ways, but I think they just meet different scene needs tbh",

So the bottom one almost looks like it's trying too hard. \n\nAlso, mirroring what another poster says, 'showing teeth makes things more scarier' is a trend that's overdone a bit. It can work, don't get me wrong, but here it feels a bit... silly. Especially on rectangle face on the right. Everyone else's grins are small and understated, to an extent, so it makes them feel more sleazy, greasy, if that makes sense. But blockhead there is trying to convince auntie Bettie that no, in face, he does not need to go to the dentist, and is failing that persuasion check.\n\nEnd of the day, both work, but I'd lean more toward the first option.

The reworked option I think is a bit too grotesque for this type of calm dread, but quite great if you want to scale up the feeling and transition from unease into pre-panic for example. Or you can make the faces more distorted in the second one, if you want to go for disgust. \nAlso, this style kinda reminded me of Flash animated indie series on youtube called “Courier” (original title: Курьер) by ReminorBand. [Here’s a link to the first episode](https://youtu.be/x9J2A5I1P4o?si=wGWaO34mGz0cwD3N) in case you trust random strangers on the internet, otherwise feel free to look it up yourself. Highly recommend to at least check out first 5-10 minutes, you may get some inspiration from that (you’ll get from what character when you see it).

With all due respect, that will singlehandedly be the reason this game never sees the light of day.\n\nMaybe a really good game, but unfortunately most people will never know.\n\nMost games in this space don't even ask for anything over $15 at full price. And even that's pushing it. At $10 this game would sell like hotcakes. It would be an impulse buy for a lot of people.\n\nYou also need to consider how that converts to different countries, as a lot of your audience might not even reside in the US. If it's too high for us here, it's probably unobtainable elsewhere.\n\nDifferent type of game, but even Stardew was only asking 15, and theres a lot to offer there.\n\nBest of luck!",

I intented the content to be crowd-sourced, however, the project didn't get any traction in the relevant community, which was small and quite apathetic to such endeavors. Somewhat surprising, considering that the community desired a (fan-made) sequel to a retro game, with a handful of such projects announced, yet none getting into a playable state before being lost in history.\n\nAlso, retrospectively, I might've made some big game design mistakes, as I didn't think of the game from the design standpoint of view, and my decisions were a lot more arbitrary and \"how I like it\", rather than based or well-thought.\n\nResult: at least I know how to code a strategy game, if nothing else.",

It had a bunch of novel systems like a time-based currency to solve the \"money is worthless since world builders can just add as much as they want\" problem.\n\nEverything from graphics and sounds to object scripts could be edited. You can also create custom items and other players can import those items into their own worlds, which would allow them to be used there.\n\nI worked on it for around 10 years on and off, but completely failed to gain any traction with it.\n\nIt still exists as a demo on Steam and is way more complete than any sane person would expect from something with so little publicity.

The new one is more friendly, and 'in small' / as thumbnail it looks better. Ahaha maan, capsules are haaard.\n\nHope the gods of marketing smile upon you and you get tons of sales aaaa",

It's unfindable on Google as it always returns Deathloop instead of your game. Seems like quite a big SEO issue. Not sure how to fix that without changing the name of your game though but maybe someone else here has advice for that.\n\nThe big problem with this is that you are gonna lose a big percentage of the people that find your game somewhere online in a video or screenshot and all they have to go on is the name. Many will not bother to launch Steam and look it up there in the search, a part will, but a part won't. So you are definitely going to miss out on a chunk of potential sales due to this issue. If I was you I would take this seriously and fix this before release",

Though I think it's worth mentioning that I also share a slight concern over contrast and readability.\n\nI can see that you put a glow on the player's character to help them stand out, which is a great start.  Though this still doesn't seem to help a ton to differentiate between their character and enemies when the action picks up (between 17s - 20s in the trailer).  I think this is mostly only an issue in the red environment - as humans tend to be a bit less sensitive to contrast in that part of the visual spectrum compared to the greens in the first and last parts of the trailer.  \n  \nObviously though this is hard for me to say for certain without actually playing the game for myself.\n\nThat said, OP should take my advice (and pretty much all feedback) with a grain of salt, but maybe a splash of color added to the player's character would be worth trying.  Particularly a color that isn't often used elsewhere in the visual design language of the game.  I'm imagining a bright red scarf, or purple robe for example.  That, or maybe slightly increase the contrast of the glow effect in that particular environment?\n\nAnyhow... the hard work absolutely shows, and I definitely look forward to checking it out for myself when it launches!",

The streaming aspect would have been more obvious if you added the live, battery logo etc up there. \nThe new one doesn't really convey him streaming but seems more like a holiday recording of such if that makes sense? Feels a bit more spotless than the old one due to it being more busy. \n\nI believe a combination of both approaches would be cool. Show Sisyphus holding the bolder with his sholer and arm, smiling towards the camera on his side or behind him with a thumps up. Make the live streaming aspects camera view aspects VERY obvious like in the new one. Maybe add hands like someone is holding the camera and their fingers or entire hand is kinda overlapping the camera. Makes the player feel more engaged by looking at it and conveys the aspect of streaming yourself more obvious. Make the background less busy like in the old version. With that you should very accurately convey the style of game that you are going for. Hope that helps!",

The odd one is fine if you’re attempting to understand a concept (recommend Sebastian Lague) but don’t copy them.\n\n- Don’t go small - I know the advice is too “make pong” so that you get a finished game but that never motivated me. I got bored really easily so I ended up not caring. Also don’t build your dream game. Go for something that you could theoretically build in 3 months on something that interests you. You like strategy? Build a Tower Defence. You get the idea.\n\n- Limit yourself time wise - don’t push yourself to do as many hours as you can, you’ll just burn out. Do a maximum of x hours a day and write down what you want to accomplish in those hours. You’ll find that you’re more excited to go back to it. Also, time away from a problem helps you reevaluate it with fresh eyes 😊\n\nGood luck!",

Surely a lot of aspiring game devs' first dream is to work in some big companies and be involved in some AAA games, which is not realistic and achievable in a short term.\n\nBut a lot of times, we just have some simple ideas, mechanics, that we are not seeing in any game and we want those custom made. In that case, I'd say do build your dream game, or some simpler variations of it (so it ties back to your pointl).\n\nI guess one of the most important and universal advice for this industry is that, build something you truely love and want to play yourself. If it's not about the survival of your company or anything, like your life depends on it, then nothing else really matters that much honestly if you're passionate about it.",

It's not easy to find someone you work well with, and who's willing to work on something without any guarantee of pay, but I think for some of us it's the only practical way. \n\nWe can't all have the mental fortitude of those behind the rare success stories.",

It is easy to just say \"Do Babysteps\" but this advice is common for a reason. \n\nWhat helped me is physically (or digitally) writing down the task and then breaking it down even further into its subcomponents. You can take this pretty far down. Then you can tackle these subtasks if you find it is still too big you can subdivide it on the fly. You'll feel the progress if you can strike through even just a simple subtasks. It will boost your energy. \n\nThese subtasks can be as simple as \"implement WASD movement\", \"Make a popup\", \"Make character jump\", \"Do one sword sprite\", \"Do a pickup sound\". \n\nAnother advice is to not overthink if what you are doing is right.  Make it crappy first, you can polish it up later.  As your experience grows making old stuff better will be much easier. \n\nIf you are stuck on one problem go the next one maybe you'll find the solution while working on something else. \n\nAlso taking breaks is not bad. Take a breather once an hour/30 minutes. Set a timer for one hour in which you'll work on the game and then set a timer for the breather as well. Maybe also play a game which you can pause or has short levels. Or just go outside for 5 minutes. Different stuff works for different people.\n\nWhat could work is not scaling down the difficulty but scaling down the scope. \n\nAnyway I sincerely hope this helped.",

If you have coverage for it, it can be really nice. \n\nI'm personally happiest when I'm learning something new and pushing toward a goal. A few months of therapy when I was younger put me in the headspace I needed to be in to find that motivation. I may not always be in that headspace, but it helped me find it in the first place and find how to get there more consistently.

I take notes, I put tons of comments to explain to myself what I'm thinking/doing.\n\n\nIn my free time I watched videos on coding principals and good code habits.

If failing bums you out, it's much harder to go far with a skill. Program to be better tomorrow, not to be great today.\n\n\nEdit to add: playing games that require you to think like a programmer like factorio or spacechem can be good to learn abstracting problems and reframing stuff.

You have to understand that failing is part of the learning process and Game Development is really high skill field (depending on what you want to achieve). Maybe baby steps are boring but they usually provide you with fundamentals. \n\nYou have a knack for writing though! You can do this. I recommend you start with stuff you like doing. Maybe you are a writer, or a painter, maybe you'd rather learn how to make 3d models or pixel art or something.\n\nGame development isn't just opening a game engine and program gameplay. Maybe for starters, why dont you sit down and physically design your game? Like open a text book, start writing your story, make character designs, theorycraft how your levels are going to look like. Game Design is part of game development as well.\n\nThen you will be able to have a list of features you'd want to have for your game to achieve which will be easier to break down and either look for in tutorials or think on your own. It's easier to solve something small rather than try to write a whole game.\n\nI've started making a game in April 2025 (i'm relatively experienced and a professional game dev). I didn't touch my engine until Late December. Partly due to time constraints but also becuase i was having fun writing down all those and designing and drawing. Game dev is as fun as you want it to be. You don't have to make a game in a month in order to be good. So have fun!",

The game also has a time loop element to it and it's so beautiful to think and create the timelines, to conceive it so that every version gives the player a specific feeling. And this game is a parenthesis, a focal point that links 2 bigger otherwise unrelated stories (that will each have their own game) and you can play the bigger games without playing this smaller one but you'll be left with unanswered questions. I have a whole universe going on. I also love composing and I sing, and I've created my beautiful characters that I'm so proud of. All that is left, it's putting all of this in UE5 and I hate it",

Organize your work into small steps and in the future as you get familiar with the process you will automatically recognize these steps and arrange them in your head leaving spaces for things that you don't know how to do.\n\nYou will make mistakes and you will most often take a hard way around, then down the line you will figure out that there is a much easier way to do the same thing, this is all part of the process so don't feel the need to do things properly from the beginning, make it work",

I started with very little and after months of learning Godot and Blender I reached this point:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/1nzxtvw/9\\_months\\_learning\\_godot\\_blender\\_and\\_this\\_is\\_what/](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/1nzxtvw/9_months_learning_godot_blender_and_this_is_what/)\n\nIt is also a rough time for gamedevs - a lot of competition and titles on Steam every year so no guarantees it will ever pay off. I treat it as a hobby - I have a stable day job and I am not risking everything on it. But if it pays off... good, learned something and someone paid me to learn stuff. My attitude is - someone fires up Fortnite, I fire up Blender, someone fires up Minecraft, I fire up Godot. Infinitely better to spend time making games than wasting it playing them. I don't even find pleasure in playing games, making them is infinitely more fun for me.\n\nAnd there is a lot to learn. Programming, 3D, art, sound, tools, even editing own damn screenrecordings if you wanna post it on TikTok or YouTube. And then when you think you're done with the development - the marketing nightmare begins (because nobody heard of your game)!!! Good thing is that Steam will take more of an algorithmic approach to the games and push more \"similar content\" to make discovering \"rare gems\" easier so they are at least earning their 30% cut, but even the best algorithm won't help everyone.\n\nIt is not for everyone, but it can be rewarding. After about a year, things that made no sense at the start finally began to click. When I look in the retrospective I can understand how much I've learned so far. You can't see that ahead, only behind.\n\nI'm not trying to discourage you, but to be realistic. Take from this whatever you find useful.",

You need to figure out why you feel that way and learn about how you're wired. That's serious work, but it's worth it 100%.\n\nLet me know if this cycle feels familiar:\n\nMake up an idea of escaping current reality (to get success or social proof, etc.) -> getting excited about this idea (idealizing) -> facing first challenges -> leads to frustration and devaluation of the goal -> leads to a short but intense depressive period (gaming to escape reality) -> leads to another genius idea -> REPEAT.\n\nIf this cycle feels right to you, then maybe you have some traits of NPD or vNPD (Vulnerable Narcissistic Personality Disorder). \n\nIT IS NOT clinical advice, and if you want to know for sure, you can start therapy.\n\nBut if it feels too big, you can try to talk to ChatGPT as a small start. Just tell it about your life, your burnout cycles and ask if it looks like vNPD or what other patterns it looks like. If you find something real that you want to work on - you can go to therapy. It's really the best way to fix what you're describing, rather than trying to use gamedev and productivity tricks that will lead to burnout anyway, because efficiency is not the problem here.\n\nP.S. for god sake, be cautious if you try to read about vNPD on the internet. There's so much people who demonize this, and so much people just have some traits of it without being fully diagnozed as NPD.",

I don't know what kind of game you're making so this might not even be relevant, but if you've got like an invincibility powerup then the full face mask look could be a fun extra detail for that. Just a thought.\n\n  \nBut if I was going to pick just one as the best, I'd probably go with A1.",

Also I would say anything from A1 to A3 are good choices. The final decision should depend on the way your character is setup. If you want a less experienced rookie knight then go with A1. A3 looks more hardcore with the sharper cheek plate so it would represent a more experienced and badass version of the character. A2 on the other hand is a fine balance between the two. Every other version you lose too much detail and the character becomes more generic. But like I said where the character is currently in their story should be the deciding factor. \nHope this helps",

I've seen an armored bloke surrounded by an elf, an org, and a dwarf before. too many times, in fact. but that is not the biggest problem. The background and the characters say nothing about the game; there is no personality to them. it makes me want to click on another game, actually. something with little more… pizzazz.\n\n\nI do not think under any circumstance would I have clicked on the second capsule, had I seen it in the store. however, I would have at least given a cursory glance to the first capsule.\n\n\nhowever, I must say that both capsules are not very captivating themselves. they just scream generic dungeon game to me. what about your game stands out? what do you want your players to remember about your game, other than \"tactics\"? find THAT, then place it in your capsule.\n\n\n\np.s. i should like to specify that i am in your target demographic for games like this.\n\nwith love,  \ne",
