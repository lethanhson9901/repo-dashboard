Then you got the more experienced and more established artists who will charge you maybe up to $1000 and more depending complexity especially and then you got industry professionals that also work with and for serious studios and who have a prestige, name and experience and skills that will charge you easily up to several thousands of dollars for a capsule art but those bring more to the table than people think. Its more than just about polished looking capsule/key art and something lower tier of artists simply lack.\n\nProfessional artist here.",

If the stories we read here, and the Steam statistics are true 90% of games made wouldn't even recoup that cost nevermind everything else? If most games here sell for 3-10$ and steam takes 30% of the top you need to sell 20-100 copies(for the low end cost, not even counting the 1k) just to pay for one image?

                  "text": "I'd like to add on to this that a good clause for a commercial use contract like capsule art etc, is to make the up front flat fee a non-refundable advance on royalties, and include in the agreement a royalties fee which caps out at a higher flat amount. Say 3 to 5 times the initial amount given up front. This helps keep the startup cost lower while not taking advantage of the artist unfairly in the case where their art helps a product go viral for serious sales numbers. \n\nExample math: artist is paid $300 for a piece of marketing art such as Steam capsule art. The contract specifies this as an advance, non-refundable, on a 1% royalty on gross of all sales past the first 1000 copies. The royalty fee is scheduled to cap out at $1500 total, 5x the advance. The game is sold at a price where the developer gets $6. Therefore, until the game sells 6000 copies, the artist isn't owed anything more. Many games will never reach this benchmark and the contract becomes effectively a flat fee. If the game sells 26,000 copies, the cap will be reached, so even if it goes on to sell a million copies, the artist's financial interest in it is terminated past that point.\n\nFor the developer, $1500 from the sales gross of $156,000 is well worth paying for a key presentation piece without which those sales likely wouldn't happen. For the artist, getting the extra payday when the game releases and does well prevents resentment at not benefiting from that performance in proportion to their contribution. If the game sells really exceptionally well even beyond that, well, probably the developer should hire the same artist again for future projects, and pay more up front this time.",

They might be amateurs, but if people in the comments think this can be done better for less than 300 bucks, they might be exploiting people that undercharge.\n\nEdit: OK, after looking at the image something feels off.

There is something there, but it's not workable.\n- Artist should have worked with you and let you approve a mockup, design concept, approval draft, or similar. I'd be pissed at being left in the dark then presented with a \"final\" without approval. But if the artists did keep you in the loop and you did approve delivery, then it is what it is.\n\nThere are some tricks with exposing eyes and human faces that'll capture people's attention better, as it's basically hardwired into every animal's brain to look for eyes and spend some processing power to identify what happens next. That's the charm in the first one that I think other people are getting too. But I can't say which one is better without more research because the most important thing with key art is to set up the promise your game intends to deliver on.",

The composition doesn't stand out; it's just a knight standing out against a somewhat lifeless background. It's not AI work, I can say that pixel art AI is still very distinctive, you can see it from miles away, but it should have cost you less. If you hadn't paid, I would have told you to ask for changes, make the background more interesting, and give the character more of an illusion of movement. It's too stiff and doesn't stand out.",

If you see inconsistent pixel sizing, blurred edges, or grid misalignment, it’s often a sign that the image was either AI-generated or created by applying a pixelation filter rather than being hand-crafted pixel art.",

Like fighting against shadows or against forces of ruin, that kind of thing. The roundedness of the text gives it a sort of casual feel, so my guess would be some kind of scavenger or platformer thing, but not really sure. Uncertain on gameplay time, feels a bit unsure of where it's going. The eye on the knight wasn't something I noticed until one of the comments pointed it out, it read more as general play-of-light.\n\nThe new one is more eyecatching to me (colors! Yellow and white!), but feels sort of generically indie. Gives more of a hack-and-slash or pixel-adventure feel (*could* be a clicker game, but unlikely), something that follows a knight main character as they go do... stuff. Probably progression. Small-scale, I'd guess 8-10 hours of gameplay (before clicking in or scrolling), etc. Generic presentation, but the kind where it feels like it's got a theme going.\n\nI haven't clicked on the store page to see what the game's about; I wanted to give a vibe/impression read without being influenced by knowing what the game's about.\n\nI'm not a hugely active gamer these days - life and all that - but my general interests/games are things like Subnautica, Stardew Valley, Wolfenstein: The New Order, Dwarf Fortress, and Potion Craft, so there's a decent spread but I'm not particularly keyed into the indie scene.",

          "text": "I guess take this with a grain of salt given all the feedback haha, but for what’s its worth, I can appreciate the redesign and could see how the price was fair for the work.\n\nThe typography on the new design is nice and the coloring and the iconography does a good job of both conveying the knight theme and the incremental aspect in a way your original didn’t. You’re essentially buying a logo redesign and character art and background which feels like it would reasonably cost a certain amount to cover an artist’s time.\n\nThat being said, I do understand the concerns too, I think my first instinct was also wondering whether it was a great deal. A few things people have mentioned - the new character is a bit generic, the pose is a bit stiff, I personally think some stronger lighting or maybe some particles could make the scene composition look more interesting. The character is also smaller in the new design, which means that it’s harder to appreciate when tiny. \n\nI was wondering if potentially the layout of your post made this scale effect even more pronounced, as seeing all the time and cost spelled out leaves even less room for the artwork to shine haha. I do think if I zoom in I like the new design better. \n\nOf course, capsule art needs to be read at a small scale in general, but if the artist is delivering something that took time and craft and detail to produce but wasn’t exactly what you needed, maybe that’s something more indicative of needing closer portfolio review or instruction than being a rip off necessarily.\n\nAnyway all that just to say I think it wasn’t a total loss to commission the logo redesign and wishing you all the best with the game! :)",

Could maybe be a little faster and cheaper but for a custom waist/up illustration + background combined with a stylized logo, that is about the price range I’d expect although I would definitely be wanting the files, as they are yours. People in the comments here are overreacting tbh, I’ve done logo design for 10ish years and while I rarely ever have a reason to charge over 100, if someone asked me for a custom illustration to go along with the logo then it would definitely float around 250ish but that’s also under the assumption that I’m giving them all art files to use how they want, background, character, etc. I think it looks fine, but if you want changes just ask for them, the artist likely factored revisions into the price and if not, then they are charging too much.",

I would also however repeat similarly to what others, and say the capsule art is currently the weak part on your steam page. I like the graphics, the steam screenshots looked varied and interesting and the trailer was decent. Which caused me to click download, I play a lot of demos on the weekends though so I click open all kinds of new games no matter the capsule. I think this game is def a gem so it would be well worth putting some investment into a good capsule artist if you can afford it. Great work, and best of luck! :)",

          "text": "Assuming this is an idler/incremental game off the title, I'm going to go a bit against the other people here - this art works just fine as an advertisement. I'm not saying it's outstanding, or unique, but it should work well enough that I would just take this as a lesson in getting pricing quotes and confirming the artist's vision is in line with yours. \n\nWhile most games (and products in general) are made/broken by the first image in the advertisement, they also exist in the context of people in the market for similar products. If this was some combination of pixel-art side-scrolling RPG rogue-lite then the generic art style would probably make people wary of the product and question why they should buy it over the other dozen beside it, but for idlers it just needs to look professional enough to stand marginally above the sea of free titles you're competing with for attention. Take this with a mountain of salt, but there is a chance that a decent colour palette and composition will go further in this genre than a soulful style and consistent details/proportions - although, of course, anyone would usually prefer all of the above. Shit, the outlining/drop-shadowing of the title is probably more important to catching eyes than the design of the knight.\n\nSo, even though people have raised a lot of valid concerns with the piece, I would probably scroll down a Steam search of idlers and imagine your game sitting beside them at whatever price point you're looking at. Do you think it stands out enough to get some traffic? Is the title too small when scaled down to the size it will display as on the Steam search? Is it the most expensive title a dozen games either direction? Do the other visuals on the page stand out enough to convert traffic into purchases? Do they accurately display how your game will be similar/different to other games in the genre? You're advertising an idler game to a bunch of idler fans, not a video game to nondescript video game fans. Would you yourself give the game a chance, as (presumably) a fan of the genre?\n\nPlaying with a few filters myself, I'm seeing a lot of blank or single-detail backgrounds which only show off the title. The ones that aren't often look too busy, as if they're a wall poster and not the thumbnail to a Steam game. Could yours be executed better, both generally as a piece of art and specifically as the advertisement to an idler game? Yeah, in many regards. But, as a random internet commenter, it looks better than plenty of what I'm seeing, including games with some attention. Paid idlers are very hit-or-miss since they compete with so many free titles, but yours still looks more professional than many of the hits.",

The capsule art can be what makes a person even pay attention to your game. I’m not commenting on whether this artist deserves it or not with their drawing, but in general. $300 for a full illustration piece for capsule art is cheap. The internet has just done a great job at devaluing the work it takes. Their are INCREDIBLE artists you could commission for this, but they will charge you more.\n\nJust like with tattoos.. you get what you pay for a lotta the time. I’m not saying you specifically did wrong, $300 isn’t a terrible idea of how much to pay, I’m really just responding to those who think it’s too much in general. And if it is, then learn to draw yourself (I mean it not sarcastically). \n\nAnd to comment on this specific art: I have a hard time seeing AI in pixel art, but to me it looks like it’s made legitimately. If they had done AI there probably would be more to it. Did you like the artist’s other work? I feel hesitate to say this cause I seem to be in the minority here, but if I saw this capsule art I would click on it. I honestly mean that, I promise I’m not saying it just to be contrarian. It gives off a similar vibe to other games I like to play, so I could give it enough attention to click.",

One of the tells of AI is that it is absolutely terrible at pixelart as it requires consistency of format (i.e., not mixels) which are all over this piece. It looks like it was generated and downsized... The title alone is very rough.\n\nI'd be pretty upset by this. Did the artist have a following or portfolio?",

Hell some artists have even started working on commissions while streaming or while on a discord call, though that's not super common yet.",

The knight theme gets it across albeit kind of bland.  Tho for what you're getting is okay, kind of crazy for commenters to say it's super fucking terrible.  Paying comparingly to like $3.75/hr if they spent 80hrs or $7.5/hr if they did this in 40hrs.\n\nAgree with the rest of the comments tho, you definitely get a better return if you iterated a new capsule yourself. (Especially the composition of your knight/bg is still very visually interesting tho muted in colors so not recognizable first glance) Take reddit opinions with a grain of salt tho cause you're getting the most vocal minority than actual data of people choosing to click on this or not.",

For me i try to update throughout the process at every part especially if the commissioner is paying that much, but even if it was a cheap commission I try to update constantly to make sure everything is to the commissioners liking... it makes me wonder why they didnt do that? I get that every artist has different methods and such but it seems like the bare minimum to at least check in?... and in no way is their art bad! But i do think they should've checked in to at least see if you liked it? Especially for the price.. but again back to their other work, is this similar to their other work they've done or youve seen or is this much more sloppy or what? And what did you originally ask for? Or did you want a legit just pixel version of the reference photo? Sorry i dont mean to pry im just curious lol [again not blaming you for anything and not hating on the artist just wondering what the communication was like lol] \n\n[IN COMING SELF PROMOTION OF MY OWN COMMISSIONS AND ART THAT DOES NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE POST AT HAND READ UPON YOUR OWN WILL]\nbut besides that if do commissions like I said so if anyone in the comments or OP if you guys want a commission i might as well use this comment to somewhat advertise myself lol, but i have multiple examples of my art on my profile as well as more examples i can send through dms, I can do animation as well as art in general, I'm fine with drawing/animating : ocs,ships,furry,nsfw,gore,sfw,backgrounds,dynamic poses,i can also imitate other anime styles,and more[just ask] (i just have alot of mha on my profile because thats my fav anime and alot of people who commission also really likes that anime lol but I ofcourse do more than mha, and all nsfw content on my profile is hidden but if you want examples of past coms ive done let me know through dms)\nI allow commissioners to set the price they think is fair to pay that way I dont overprice or underprice my art🧍\nAnd as far as payment goes i only take payment either upfront or half upfront and half afterwords, and as far as how I take payments I can take it in forms of giftcards[usd],cashapp, or revolut[worldwide currency transfer app so I can take almost any currency]\nI have many references of past people who have commissioned me, and as far as work around time I try to get work done quick and usually start on drawing right after payment is sent unless I have responsibilities to take care of in real life at that moment[school,chores,family] and I have no problem with working within time lines and or picky critiques, I have no problem with redrawing something untill to someones liking and I give constant updates at everyday from rough pose scetch, rough scetch, lineart, and coloring/rendering.\nAs far as rules I have for myself that I'm not willing to budge on is that I will not take payment afterwards, it is either payment upfront or half payment upfront and then the other after\n\nbut if you would like a commission just dm me on here and then we can go from there and I can show more of my work^^\nI also have both a tiktok and an insta were you can see some of my work there than too^^ just ask^^\nAnd alot of commissioners tend to like to continue conversation over to discord and I also have one of those sk if youd like just ask for my tag ir send yours^^",

The look of a game matters, yes, and it will definitely help you with marketing.  3D games have generally more broad appeal these days than 2D games and your assets look great from the more 3D perspective.  That being said, there’s a huge market for 2D games as well!  If you think the gameplay works better in the top-down 2D perspective, DON’T LISTEN TO THESE PEOPLE.  Your job as a game designer is designing the game based upon your tastes, you can take other peoples ideas and suggestions into account but at the end of the day you have to decide what’s best for your game.  I would suggest you take the warm reception this post has received into account and consider adding sections of the game where you switch to that perspective, but you do not need to change the entire game into just that perspective.",

I don't really have an opinion personally, but if the feedback is that the experimental camera is way cooler, and it's how you feel as well, then it would be a major miss to ignore it. Consider it a lesson to prototype and gather feedback early instead of changing things at the last minute. Or maybe it was a stroke of cleverness and luck that you thought of it at all and there's no lesson to be learned. Regardless, you have work to do.\n\nAgain, I can't answer which one is better, but if people are playtesting and watching marketing material and consistently saying they want the experimental camera, then the answer is really obvious.",

Oh yes, it definitely does: it's intriguing and appealing. \n\nI can imagine it will require more work, but in my opinion the new 3/4 view is beautiful and, on top of that, it doesn't immediately remind me of other games: I think that's a huge plus for the game's potential success.",

Not what the players think they want, nor what the programmers expect, but what people enjoy playing the most. Sometimes it can be as simple as a  perspective shift. And then earnestly listening to the voice of the customer and tuning your product to be the product they will want (when they can buy it)\n\nSo yes, listen to what the future players are saying they want. But it's good to look at the 360 of the request: are they saying they prefer the isometric view because you can see more of the map, or are they saying they like the view because of the increased dynamism the angle grants? If the later, you may see greater returns if you target in on that and focus on both the gameplay and the experience of the gameplay.",

Makes it easier on the eyes in my opinion, from a viewers perspective at least. In my opinion the top down view makes it a bit more \"cluttered\", I guess is how I would describe it. In my opinion I think you should keep it as is. But at the end of the day it isn't my opinion that should matter. If you feel like the 3/4 view embodies your vision for the game you should go for it. If the top down view is the way YOU, emphasis on the you since it is your game and your creation, you should go for it. Lots of games have changed up their gameplay and style in their promotion videos. \n\nJust do what makes you feel proud of the game and what makes you happy. Don't follow what other people say blindly. This also includes what I say. \n\nKeep up the good work and good luck!",

Because as it is now, with the fortune teller being free, there's really no point in avoiding going to her every step of every game and just mindlessly going wherever she tells you, ruining the game's fun at no expense.\n\n>There is a hint of an interesting meta with the interstitial plot, but other games have implemented this better. In Hades, I could save up a currency found in-game to drive the meta's story forward and unlock it bit by bit. Something like that would have helped here, but as it is, it feels overly simple and without any sense of agency.\n\n>Ultimately, the developer was onto something here, but unfortunately it feels like they didn't really know where to \"find the fun\" and eventually abandoned it before it could be a mature product. I hope they iterate on this because I do feel like there's a fun game in here somewhere.",

Hell even the original Hollow Knight had a significantly lower price, and regularly went on sale for even less. Part of what helped Hollow Knight be so successful was the the low price made it easy for people to want to try based on the good reviews.\n\nBy the time they released Silksong they had already proven themselves with HK, and people knew they were going to get an amazing game for their money.

          "text": "In my honest opinion the game simply isn't innovative enough. Is it cute? Hell yes. But art style does not sell the way it used to. What about the gameplay? Metroidvanias are quite done to the death and when you remove combat you sort of remove a thing people hearing about metroidvanias also come for, thus cutting some audience out.\n\nI don't know how you marketed your game exactly so it is hard for me to say whether you did it right or not in the retrospective. You didn't give us any wishlist or copies sold numbers either. SteamDB estimates you sold between 1K and 2.3K copies of the game. I can imagine after 7 years, this is unprofitable, especially in France.\n\nAverage players per day is rather meaningless for a game you play once and never again. I think it's pretty pricy too. Even if the game got the huge recognition you wanted, it should die out eventually, that's a normal and health lifecycle for games.\n\nMy game has certainly a tiny audience right now and I too hear people say it's a hidden gem in the making or that they were waiting for a game like that for years. And that's super encouraging, but it is sadly not equal to success just yet. The goal is not to make a perfect game for a few people, but good enough game for great many people.\n\nI think this is a good example of a game that was overengineered. The concept was simple, but the amount of work put into polish and art was simply disproportionately large to the amount of gameplay itself. In my opinion.\n\nI want to quote this one review you got:\n\n>It's ok.\n\n>I appreciate the thought and care that went into a randomizable modular Metroidvania like this. Took ambition to step outside of the norm and attempt something unique. And I do love the decidedly French aesthetic.\n\n>However, there's just not enough meat on the bone to justify the high price tag. There's very little to do in the game besides the \"fetch quest\" portion of the genre (no combat, no puzzles, no secrets, etc). I wonder what the fortune cookies were originally meant for; perhasps a currency to use at the fortune teller? Because as it is now, with the fortune teller being free, there's really no point in avoiding going to her every step of every game and just mindlessly going wherever she tells you, ruining the game's fun at no expense.\n\nSo someone who did play arrived at the same conclusions more or less.\n\n\\-----\n\nSo what would I do?\n\nWell, you have an amazing core, I mean the game is beautiful, so just make more of it. Add more levels, but add more mechanics, add puzzles, add secrets, add more things a player can interact with, manage, intertwine those and try to add them back to into the old levels if possible. Even just reuse assets, but try to make it mechanically more engaging.\n\nI don't think you can suddenly turn the game around. Buuuuuut, you can make a sequel. Reuse the assets, add mechanics, but benefit from fresh wishlist count, fresh opportunity at demo and steam fests, and of course you can send that notification via steam to all players of the old game. And sequels seem more interesting to press I think since it indicates the game was successful enough. It doesn't matter the game didn't sell as well as you wanted to, because it did sell at all and that's good. So capitalise on it. That's my advice.",

It's that very little people actually know about the game in the first place.\n\nI think it's more about marketing your game. Man, like, watching Two Star videos about Choo-Choo Charles made me get back into game dev! If you do YouTube shorts, you reach a wider audience. I dunno.. the truth is, the market is pretty oversaturated and to actually sell the game, people have to know about it, right? It has to be hype somehow.. \n\nThe difficult truth of today's world is game consumers mainly look for looks. When I usually listen to people gloss over games, it's about how close to reality the game is (\"You shoot a rocket at a building and it actually collapses into rubble!\"). I'm kind of scared to that myself, not gonna lie. It means if I really want to launch a money making game, I'm going to have to invest in high quality assets and compromise on the performance **a lot**.\n\nGood luck mate\n\n\n\nEdit:\nOkay dude, I have now watched the trailer you posted for your game and I can safely say there's a ton of reasons why I won't download it or play it myself:\n\nFirst off -  The issue of \"My game is a combination of X game and Y game with Z game elements\". Dude, do YOU. Why would you even mention the games you copied the mechanics of? I get it, as a developer, you want other devs to understand what you want to achieve, but as a creator, you need to talk to the audience in these trailer videos.. What you need is something original, something unique. A player might say \"Well that's just Game X and Game Y\", but by then it won't matter if the game is fun.\nI mean, why play a clone game when you can play the original, right?\n\nSecond, I saw a lot of interactions with objects. And a lot of text from you. It didn't feel personal, as in, no voice. The little joke you tried to pass at the end was actually the moment I understood why nobody downloaded the game. You need to sell it - which brings me to point 3.\n\nI virtually have no clue what would I do in your game. If I showed this trailer to someone and said \"So, you wanna play?\", the answer's gonna be \"Play WHAT? What do you do?\" And just by watching the vid, I have no idea. What's the purpose? I mean, do you get creative in there? Release stress? Break stuff? Earn something? A story? WHY should someone play the game? \nPut that in the trailer, rather than some silly jokes.\n\nAlso, \"Another reason for a bathroom break\".. Man, I cringe for you. Makes me wonder how old actually are you..\n\nHope you actually learn from my POV. Don't take it personally. Apply yourself",

But the form that aesthetic needs to take is highly dependent on context. Only a small subset of games actually benefit from the sort of realism you're talking about. A platformer where you play as a talking mouse really isn't where you need to be concerned with realism. But you still do need to consider aesthetics and presentation.",

The way YouTube works, you really have to make a lot of content, and then start finding the couple that worked out and start aiming toward that strategy. Also run ads for videos that \"blow up\". (300 views when you usually get 1-2 is blowing up).\n\nAs the other poster mentioned, I don't really know what to expect from your game trailer. And $17.99 is a lot for an unknown indie game.\n\nFrom what I see, this is more in the $8 range. \n\nYou need to make a better trailer, showing what the player will do, and why. And outlining the story, why the mice keep going on adventures?\n\nThen make a lot(100+) shorts about the story, unlocks, etc. 15-30 seconds long and release them daily.\n\nIdeally one or two of those will get some real traction from the algorithm, and then you can start advertising those. Basically rinse and repeat that process. (Throw in other platforms like YouTube, and Instagram) Give copies out for free to streamers and communities with giveaway keys for them.\n\nAs for the price, when you start running ads, I would tack on a 50% off sale for a few weeks. To get the intro price at a better place. Also makes impulse buys more likely.\n\nMost games on steam launch with a 10% off discount because that's the threshold to get into the deals frontpage on steam.\n\nThe other thing I would say about your game, is it feels very child oriented, with the bright and vibrant pastel colors.",

Your game may justify the price, but unfortunately the art style alone is hard to sell with higher prices. If nothing worked anyway, try to make an update to the game and make a marketing beat about \"Update + price drop\". Maybe this is your last chance. Looking at other devs, you can go all in on one idea, work for years and hope the best, or you test the appeal of your game often and early so that you can be sure that enough people like it. But your game is already released. I think a last straw could be taking all your assets and systems and make a whole new game out of it that is much smaller in scope while you test very often (prototype) and very early.\n\nEdit: After watching the trailer I still don't exactly know what the game really is about. One way to find your niche audience is to very clearly communicate what the game is about. There is 2D platforming, items, metroidvania-style progress, something about escaping, and you put heavy emphasis on the \"randomness\" aspect (hence the title). But I can't quite grasp it when watching the trailer.",

When you tell a 12 year old: you are a mouse and you need to do X, yeah they'll do it,  but when you tell the same thing to an 15 year old they'll ask: why? why would I do this? what is the reward? who put me here? for what purpose?\n\nyour material answers none of those questions, it just states a few facts about gameplay and what you should do, but I feel like there isn't even a why: you just created what you thought was fun. That's valid but you can't really expect anyone else but you to care about that.\n\nThat being said, even if a great call to action was included, this artstyle is just not appealing, it doesn't look 'painterly' or 'endearing', it looks cheap: no shading, super washed out colors, every line is too clean... It is consistent for sure, but I'd rather you'd have at least tried to experiment and have high highs and low lows instead of a consistently drab environment.",

But imo before you make a new push on your game’s facelift you should respond to some of the feedback here. The most important feedback I see is: What is the call to action for the mouse? Why is he going through the maps? This idea could make all the different for you I hope you’re paying attention: At the beginning of each run play one of maybe 20 short cinematic clips with a backstory for this run. Introduce some characters which give your mouse a call to action. Introduce maybe a love interest, a nemesis, etc. Try to lean into that throughout the run. That answers the call to action, of why your mouse is in this situation/why completing this run matters. Also there should be some unlocks you get between runs even if it’s just cosmetics for your mouse. If I were making your mouse game there are several things I’d do differently. When you start a run ask yourself “am I eager to play and finish this run because it has a purpose”? Even you as the dev should struggle to put your game down if it’s done right. \n\nIf you don’t want to give a call to action give a timer for the run instead, and add in little items that add to the clock. A finite clock timer is a call to action, and can be enough to keep people engaged. TLDR: Every game needs urgency/character investment/a purpose for playing. For a game like terraria, your purpose is the next weapon, the next set of armor, killing the next boss, exploring the next biome, etc. Crafting in and of itself is rewarding, as is seeing biomes, as is beating bosses. Terraria’s singular call to action is beating every boss, and you must craft a ton of items to do that. Why are we completing your runs? What’s your call to action? Is it that we only have 10 minutes to save the mouse Princess from something? Imagine if each run began with a story cinematic and ended with a non-combat boss fight that used your unlocks and the environment to fight back? Suddenly you’ve got an engaging game. Be creative and make something that attracts even you to play and complete runs. ",

Neither the voice or the recording quality sound remotely professional.\n\nYou need to focus on conveying to the viewer what the gameplay is like, what the goal is, and how you get there. The segment in the second trailer where it's rocket/grapple/pins is good - make a whole trailer with those kind of things. And try to show more environments, it looks very samey. Is there a main goal? A hint of a final level or \"boss\" section? You should tease that, whatever it is.\n\nEDIT: And sorry but the price is *waaaay* too high for Steam. You might feel it's \"worth\" that much but the market would expect a lot less for a game like this. You'd probably sell like hotcakes at 8 with 33% off. 18 euro is bananas.

The platformer genre is an insanely tough market on steam.\n2. I think the genre mash of cozy metroidvania may be working against itself too much and putting people off from both genre's\n3. I think you did a great job on the art it looks like it's from those old hidden object games. I also think that same vibe might turn off some people from your game because it can feel aged or rough around the edges.\n4. I think the price is fair but some people may find it to be way too high for what the game is to them. You'll need to leverage discounts to bring in more sales.\n\nI'm not saying your game is doomed but I think those core features of your game make it a uphill battle in an already heavily competitive market.\n\nI think if its as good as people are saying it is I think you just need to give it some time and attention to give it the best shot of turning things around.\n\n- Keep working on the challenges, keep working on bug fixes. Put out updates regularly (like every 2-3 months)\n- Keep reaching out to streamers and youtubers that haven't played your game yet. don't spam them just reach whenever you put out a new update.\n- Put it on discount whenever you put out an update it well help draw in new players.\n- start planning and prototyping your next game during this time as well.\n\nGive it another 6-9 months then move on.\n\nOr don't and start working on your next game right now.\n\nEven if the game doesn't take off, don't look back at this as a failure. You did a great job on this. You made a game, put it out there and it's way better than the average first release.\n\nFor your next game I would focus on a shorter development cycle, and a genre that performs better on Steam.",

          "text": "Oooof that's rough.\n\nFirst of, I'm sorry you got to that point and feel disappointed by the results. Genuinely.\n\nSecond, I think what to do depends on what energy you still have for that project. I you sold, let's say, 2k copies, I don't think anyone is under the impression that you have a moral duty to support the game further with the promised content. That's the challenge but also the grace you have as a solo dev: you are not held at the same standards as studios or companies wide endeavour. \n\nSo here is the different things I would consider if you don't want to work on the same game:\n\n1-Lower the base price under 15€. And I would even go lower than that at 9.99€, when in the 15-20€ bracket you are compared to Blasphemous 1 and 2, or Hollow Knight and Silksong...like this is unfortunate, and these games were released some time ago, don't have the same vibe and all, but this is unfortunately the type of comparison you have to face\n\n2-Make a deep discount for a short period, one that'll make people who wishlisted the game see a popup on Steam and impulse buy. With a bit of luck, this might bring a couple more people to actually try the game and if they like it spread good word.\n\nI don't think that can save the game per se, but that can at least try and salvage it without to much input on your part.\n\nIf you still want to work on the game though:\n\n3-Maybe prepare a big update, new challenges, or new backgrounds, or new story bits or even mechanic (though that is way harder to bring). Maybe, try and make a new character you can choose from that brings a different vibe to the dialogues...and then you repackage that either as a big update 2.0 thing with a new Steam Capsule and trailer (I'll get to the trailer after that) OR as a DLC.\n\n4-Salvage all you already have and make a sequel, if you feel passionate enough to make that.  \n\\----\n\nAll of this being said, from the outside looking in, and with the upmost respect for making the game, sticking with it through years of dev, and releasing it (I really do mean it, and the game looks cool)...I think you are overestimating the uniqueness of your concept, both as a gameplay mechanic and also as a thing you need to market.\n\nThe trailers on your YT channel is baffling to me, but I think is emblematic of your vision of your game that is making you miss the forest for the tree: because your inspiration is randomizers, that's what you are trying to sell. But effectively...for the lay-player, it's a Metroidvania with a spoon of RNG on top. You have a minute of a voice over explaning what a randomizer is, when we've had a decade of rogue-likes and games with random pick-ups in slightly changing rooms. And I KNOW that the difference is that the levels don't change, but the placement of objects do. But that doesn't make a huge difference in how you approach marketing it.\n\nI see your page, I just don't really know what I'm buying, even the description is unclear of if it has a story, what the goal is; and at 17.99€, I'm not taking the chance, unfortunately, when I could buy Silksong for 2 more euros.\n\nThere might also just be something missing visually or in the rhythm of the trailers...maybe you should have more variation than bright warm desaturated colors for the background that makes it feels like there is just one room in the screenshots or trailer. Idk. \n\nI'll try the demo tonight though since it's Steam Deck verified (kudos for that). \n\nI hope the best for you and your future endeavour. And may your next game be a success :)",

                  "text": "Anyone looking at the game right now is bouncing off due to price so... what's the point in keeping that price then?\n\n1. Looking at the game and the presentation objectively, the simplistic children's book aesthetics does not speak to me, so the positive reviews present the biggest draw - but there are too few for them to be reliable. If your game is as great as you say, then selling tons of copies for cheap will make it more appealing for more poeple. As it stands, this looks a lot like an inspired flash game that I'd play for 10 minutes to find out how it innovates, and might stick with until the end if it is good - not the type of game that can compete with Silksong and others in the 20 bucks pricerange.\n2. Randomizers are popular with a specific niche of people who have nostalgia for those randomized games (Zelda ALttP, Super Metroid, etc.). Getting excited together for something they were excited for as kids, and potentially competing against each other in a game they spent countless hours on as kids is the main draw. Also, the fact that randomizers are free and community-created gives them an air of freedom and community. Monetizing a game in this space that lacks the installbase / brand recognition of classic titles was never gonna be easy.\n3. The concept of randomizers is not inherently clear to \"normies\" - and even when they get it, it's not inherently appealing. Anyone can understand that in roguelikes you can find LEGENDARY items/perks sometimes, so if you get lucky, you'll be super powerful. This is also where much of the fun of popular randomizers comes from: At any time, you might get the hookshot or strongest sword and jump in power in a way the game does not intend. Or you could find somethingthat has a quirky hidden use (like the insect net vs Aghanim) that is not obvious at first. While not being overtly gambling, it has the same appeal as a gambling machine. Contrasting this with your game, here one could find tacks that let you climb walls - so then you climb a wall... Doesn't feel like \"breaking the game\", right? Rather feels like you're doing a necessity - like you're just doing exactly what the designer intended. If we broke down randomizers to their most basic core, we would arrive at several colored doors cluttering a room filled with colored keys. Just collecting keys and opening doors to get more keys would be an incredibly dull experience - so the actual game you build around it must already be appealing and varied before even adding the randomizer element.",

Metroidvanias don't have random unlocks they are very purposeful in progression, and you don't tend to do multiple runs of a metroidvania like your seems to suggest you do, which could be a cool unique thing about your game but you don't really mention how that actually effects gameplay other than going to location in a different order which isn't all that exciting. The randomisation doesn't seem to serve much purpose, its not like you'd end the game with a  completely different build every time you just change the order of where you go?   \nYou say there's a 20 hour campaign but endless replayablility and no indication of how that makes sense, am I to play the whole campaign again just going about the locations in a different order? Why would I do that?  \n  \nYou hint at speed runners too, it sounds like these mechanics would work for that but you've not really advertised it in that direction. \n\ngraphically it looks good and well made I just think you seem to be trying to sell it to too broad an audience.

I don’t think this is strictly necessary but you might want to find a way to hint at them.\n* In-game strings in your trailer and your descriptions in your press kit read like you translated them into English from French yourself. The trailer unique dialogue doesn’t have the same problem. This reads as a little janky. For example “A clean underwear” -> either leave the article off or expand all the way to “a pair of clean underwear”\n* Also on your announcement: “February’s challenge is there” is not how English speakers write and is extremely passive in English.\n* Your genre skews old and hardcore but your art and setting skews young and casual/cozy. That’s not really solvable but I think you might need a different trailer for each audience that emphasizes what they want to see.\n* Don’t make trailers that can’t be understood without sound on. Steam mutes it by default.\n* Your concept trailer looks like a dev room. Try to find better gameplay footage. Possibly from someone’s actual run.\n* Related to gameplay footage, if your abilities are interesting in combination, sell me on that. I only see you using one at a time.\n* You are using the rocket and breaking lights/glass too much, it’s not interesting or you’re not selling why it’s interesting.\n* Your trailer is probably better off not explaining what an item randomizer is (niche, boring) but instead explain what the gameplay experience will be like. For instance “Your starting abilities change every run. Can you escape every time!?” Or your “no two escape attempts are the same” wording from your steam blurb is decent. Lead with that hook at the beginning of a trailer.\n* It’s clear that item randomizers were your inspiration, but your inspiration and how you talk to the public do not need to be the same thing. Figure out what a person who has never heard of a randomizer wants to hear to be excited for your game.",

In general, your pricing is a bit steep - perhaps a lower MSRP subsidised by affordable cosmetic DLC is the answer; players will buy it if it’s worth it, or to support games they love.\n\nA possible mode to add would be a ghost-multiplayer system, which allows you to connect with others to race to finish ASAP with your own unique randomised outcomes.\n\nLong term, you could create a framework allowing players to create their own levels with a dedicated level editor and custom level browser; allowing users to create the content for you.

Took ambition to step outside of the norm and attempt something unique. And I do love the decidedly French aesthetic.\n\n>However, there's just not enough meat on the bone to justify the high price tag. There's very little to do in the game besides the \"fetch quest\" portion of the genre (no combat, no puzzles, no secrets, etc). I wonder what the fortune cookies were originally meant for; perhasps a currency to use at the fortune teller? Because as it is now, with the fortune teller being free, there's really no point in avoiding going to her every step of every game and just mindlessly going wherever she tells you, ruining the game's fun at no expense.\n\n>There is a hint of an interesting meta with the interstitial plot, but other games have implemented this better. In Hades, I could save up a currency found in-game to drive the meta's story forward and unlock it bit by bit. Something like that would have helped here, but as it is, it feels overly simple and without any sense of agency.\n\n>Ultimately, the developer was onto something here, but unfortunately it feels like they didn't really know where to \"find the fun\" and eventually abandoned it before it could be a mature product. I hope they iterate on this because I do feel like there's a fun game in here somewhere.\n\nDon't feel bad about it and just take feedback and you will get more players.\n\nThe person who made that review is doing  you a huge favour as most people who don't like it would have just not commented.\n\nWith a few changes you'll be golden.\n\nOr just reduce the price.",

My takes from a fairly \"normal\" point of view, and also from a fan of metroidvania is, in rough order of thoughts when first entering your page  \n\\- \"combat-free Metroidvania\" really seemed something that I would enjoy, yay!  \n\\- Tried watching the first video, hmm it's about some item randomizer? Neat, but I want to know what it's about.   \n\\- Tried second video, hoping it's some sort of pitch as to what the game is about, aside from \"metroidvania\". But that seems to be a longer explanation about item randomizer and that people like it?  \n\\- There's no more trailer  \n\\- I read the text again at the top right, you're supposed to escape? From the house presumably? But doesn't mice like living in houses? What's the motivation exactly? Just because?\n\nThat's where I normally would have dropped out, the video and photos, while looking interesting, didn't hook me. If it had some sort of filter that made it look more frame-by-frame animated I would probably have been pushed over the edge despite not having really any information from the top part of the page, maybe.\n\nAfter reading a bit more on your page it does seem like some sort of escape-the-house situation, with cutesy characters and a bit rogue-ish elements with item randomisers (now at least).\n\nHowever, my initial impression was that it seemed that you got a bunch of tools that you could use in different ways, but what you actually DID in the game was very unclear. Informing about updates is fine, but not having a game trailer for me really did it in for me, as for something \"niché\" as a combat free metroidvania, explaining what the game is about is doubly important.\n\nI do think adding some variated screenshots would also help, three out of the five screenshots is very samey, which communicates to me that it's a small game (which it may or may not be).\n\nLongwinded, but hopefully you'll get the ball rolling again, it does look interesting and i wish you the best",

I don't know their name, if they're from the house, if they have a unique perspective...\n\nWe see some character in the protagonist from your first promo video when they argue with the narration. They are.... annoyed and fixated on exploring I think.\n\nYour promo is focused on the mechanics of the game. Yes, this is how people will engage with the game. But it's missing a \"why\" to me.\n\nWhat are the stakes? Explore... or what? The protagonist is a mouse - a creature that has frequently symbolized being overlooked. What is the virtue of being small, of being quiet, of being cute? \n\nOr where your world is a character: what is the virtue of a game with no combat? Seems AWESOME to me to have a space of creative freedom that you don't have to use violence to protect. But that peacefulness is not in your promo.\n\nYour aesthetic is hand-drawn - was it slow to produce? What is the virtue of taking your time?\n\nYour game is SO much more than the mechanics, but the mechanics are the only thing I see being marketed here.\n\nTry to make a promo video about WHY we should care about the protagonist, the world, the mission, your process... anything. Give us some story sauce.\n\nGood luck to you!",

It's sort of like trying to sell me furniture without a house. \n\nThe art style is adorable and I can see it drawing people in.

It's definitely super cute and really fun. I liked all of the mechanics, the pushpins, the magnet, it's all done really well. If I'm being totally honest I think it's just price point.

There's a saying in the industry, \"every game is someone's favorite game\". It's meant to be an encouragagement to do weird things, but also a warning against focusing too much on positive feedback. Don't let praise get to your head.\n2. The problem of discoverability is THE biggest problem in modern gamedev. Amazing games with muli-million dollar budgets can get overlooked, because they chose a bad time-frame to release. As an indie dev, you should be patient - don't expect an explosion of popularity on launch, grind at it, possibly for years. I've had multiple games go unrecognized on launch, to slowly pick up sales with time.\n3. Your trailer is by far your biggest selling tool. And your trailer is pretty bad. The whole point of a trailer is to suck people in the first few seconds, and then sell them the core fantasy of the game in the next 30 seconds or so. In your case, the artstyle does somewhat draw me in, but the rest of the trailer feels random, disjointed and meandering. Show me a puzzle I need to overcome, and a clever way I will do it in the game. Or multiple ways, using different equipment. Make me want to try doing it myself.\n4. This one is a matter of personal taste: randomisers are cool, because they allow you to refresh an already amazing game. Randomiser of a game I have no emotional connection to does not excite me whatsoever. (I'm pretty sure that's also why randomiser fans aren't interested. You're mistaking garnish with protein). Neither does calling it a materoidvania x rogulike (because there's already been a bunch of amazing games in that subgenre - e.g. Dead Cells, Rogue Legacy, Sundered). Throwing around genre descriptors might catch interest of some enthusiasts, but it won't excite the majority of players, You need to sell the actual gameplay/story to them.\n\nEDIT: Having played through the demo twice (once normally, once randomized) - it fun, but not exactly innovative or deep. I bet it would sell well for 10$ (discounted to 5$ regulary) for one evening of fun",

          "text": "The goal of the game is not clearly stated. It seems aimless. I personally enjoy Metroidvanias, but the Roguelite element of it takes away from the metroidvania element. The appeal of Metroidvanias to me is the time spent in the world overcoming challenges, then after some big challenge I get a permanent unlock that enhances the game. If each run is only minutes I feel like I have no investment in my character. I would much rather a single large map to traverse, like Hollow Knight. I’m not sure the Roguelite concept works well without combat. Ultimately, Roguelite will appeal to one group of players and Metroidvania will appeal to a different group, and they don’t really overlap much. Metroidvania players like a long, tough playthrough slowly getting unlocks. Even if your metroidvania doesn’t have combat it should have enemies to avoid or obstacles that can hurt you. What are the sources of danger your mouse gets to avoid with all of its cool tools? From the trailer I just see a mouse in a world without threats zipping around the screen which does make it feel empty to me. Add to that that a run is short and afterwards all progress is lost and I’d get so bored. ",

          "text": "Hey, I checked out your game’s Steam page, and at first glance I think the main issue is the preview material (videos and images). Even though the art is charming and clearly shows the love and effort you put into it, the way it’s presented in the trailer isn’t very appealing. On top of that, the game loop isn’t very clear, and the originality isn’t immediately noticeable. Since you mention famous games and genres, it ends up feeling more like a copy than something unique, which didn’t spark my interest.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. Try to distance your game from others, avoid comparisons or mentioning similar titles.\n2. Highlight the strongest aspects of the game, especially the original mechanics. Make it feel like a unique experience that players can’t find anywhere else, creating a sense of FOMO.\n3. Emphasize the nostalgic appeal of the art style: childhood, relaxation, imagination, creativity, and handcrafted visuals. It reminds me of drawing, coloring, and classic 2D animation.\n4. Localize prices for important markets that don’t operate in dollars. I live in Brazil, one of the biggest gaming markets in the world, but our currency is weaker. Ten dollars is more than 50 reais, which feels expensive for a non-hyped indie game. I’d recommend a range between 10–25 reais.\n5. Send free keys to streamers & youtubers who focus on indie games.\n6. Consider investing in marketing campaigns on social media (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram), including ads or paid influencers, but only after improving and validating the preview materials.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nYou’ve already done the hardest part, which is making a good game. Now you just need solid marketing. Unfortunately, for indie developers, we need to understand a bit of everything, not just game development, but also marketing and sales. With improved preview materials and a clearer presentation, it could even be worth considering a small relaunch to give the game the visibility it deserves.",

And lastly I would recommend to try exploring demographics of regions outside Europe and US, I think that the gameplay of it is very similar with a lot of Japanese Doujinshi Games, so maybe your game can be more popular there, this is more common than what you would expect.

I can't tell you what to do better (and I honestly don't think many here can either) but I can tell you why I personally would've never even considered downloading the demo were it not for this post:  \n\\- never heard of it in the first place  \n\\- the trailer/screenshots/presskit don't get the idea of the game across very well  \n\\- while I understand this is personal preference, the color palette and general art style doesn't fit. I can see it working for me in a cozy hand-crafted puzzle game, maybe a point&click or visual novel. But for this genre everything is blending together too much for me.  \n\\- it looks kinda like a flash game  \n\\- price way too high  \n\\- don't care much for the randomizer\n\nWhat did work for me:  \n\\- roguelite x metroidvania sold me on trying the demo out  \n\\- the mechanics in the demo were fun and exploitable with a bit of clever thinking (massive plus for me)  \n\\- the story was introduced very well, even when skipping through some if not most dialogs I got hooked  \n\\- intuitive world design\n\nWhat I would change if it was my game (I know I said I can't tell you how to fix it, but I can tell you how I would go about it):  \n\\- one or more of the following: darken the palette / increase outline sizes / zoom the camera in more / saturate the colors more. The combination of having none of the above is making the game feel like vomit on screenshots. Something about too many things blending together into a monotone soup with nothing to catch your eye. This is not a problem when you're playing the game because you intuitively understand where you are and where you're going, but in the screenshots the player is too tiny and with too little contrast to everything else that the mechanics that the screenshots showcase don't pop out at all. You can sell it in person or with 1 on 1 interactions with players by explaining but you can't do the same thing on a steam page. I think it'd be fine if you just darkened the background, increased the outline to maybe even triple and saturated foreground more.  \n\\- pick a single main selling point (I'd personally pick the game mechanics) and laser focus on it on the steam page, only tangentially mention related selling points. Advertize to your audience - as far as I can tell from the demo there's no enemies or fighting in this - it's a pure platformer + puzzle more so than a metroidvania + roguelite.  \n\\- Widen your advertizing - everybody is doomscrolling, heck that's how I found half the games I bought last year. I know it's not always fun to make that content, but you really don't have to - you already have a bunch of people who played your game, just clip their gameplay (probably with consent) and keep posting. It only takes one 30 second clip to blow up, especially with this game as the mechanics can easily be understood from a 30 second clip while the broader implications of their existence is left in the viewers mind, selling it instantly. Remember that it takes a while before the algorithms on social media sites pick up what kind of content you're showing and what kind of people would enjoy it, so just keep at it.\n\nI would buy this in a heartbeat if it was the exact same game with entirely different graphics, I can't very well tell you to overhaul that entirely. It wouldn't be fair, that takes way too much time and money. I still think the suggestions above would help though and not at much cost, most of them would just be tracing or applying filters to existing textures.",

          "text": "saw the steam page and both the trailers. Liked the whole concept, art style. it did grab my attention.\n\n  \nnow the issue (say as a customer, not a dev) is that there is not much of a market presence of your game. The product is great (even the reviews agree!), but there is just not much info about the game's existence. And it is ironic that i got to know of your game from this post (which ironically is about why the game is not getting any attention). so you must work on getting the game in public's eyes.\n\n2nd issue (to me at least) is the pricing. i did saw comments talking about that, but there is more to it. now the game costs 810 INR, not on sale, which is already a lot, considering that skyrim ae costs roughly the same on sale. whereas for Indie games, the prices generally stay around 400-500 Rupees, which is literally half of Randomice's price. I remember buying stardew valley for 450 INR at full price, but the price is fully justifiable and not crack someone's wallet apart lol. Saying this because 810 Rupees is a lot (literally two months' worth of commute money for me!).\n\n\n\nSO yeah, best recommendation from me (again, as a customer, not a dev) is to focus on the marketing heavily, and reduce the pricing a little. The game has potential, and it deserves the success. Best wishes to you!",

That sounds like an *extremely* niche audience you're catering to, Metroidvania players don't want to just explore and backtrack, they want to *fight stuff*.  Likewise if I wanted a game like Myst but with mice, or a randomized puzzle game, I definitely would not be describing or searching for anything that I'd remotely call a \"metroidvania\" because that word means something totally different.\n\nYou might have better luck describing your game as a side scrolling puzzle adventure game.  It sounds like you've made a quality game, but you're just marketing your game in a way that only gets it in front of the *wrong* audience by invoking the wrong key terms and comparisons.",

I think ultimately this one just didn’t happen for you. \n\nI think you should go read Chris Zukowski’s blog on How to Market a Game. He talks about failed launches and what to do. \n\nIn general, his advice when this happens is always, fix any bugs and move on to your next game. You can’t really save a failed launch. \n\nHe also says to use this as a learning experience, “your first game always fails” and use all the skills you’ve developed to release a small game in a popular genre.\n\nI bet you’d do super well with using some of the mechanics and art you’ve developed here in a different, more popular genre. Metroidvanias are extremely difficult to pull off and their audience is hard to impress (as you can see). \n\nTry a more popular genre and I bet you’d be surprised how different it feels to launch. And aim for like a six month dev time.\n\nSee what happens!\n\nI’m sorry this didn’t go well for you. Best of luck. Keep going.",

          "text": "Other already mentioned, but i think the price is killing your game. It's a whole different conversation on what a game should really cost and i know it's kindof annoying to be told your game is not worth that, i'm sure the sweat and tears you put into it is worth it, but you need to see your competition and why they can be priced like that.\n\nI don't have any type of experience on this but, if was as in your position i would:\n\n\\- Apply a discount NOW, to bring it as close as possible to 10 dls, crazy i know.  \n\\- Consider in the next month to permanently reduce the price to that depending on the increased performance.  \n\\- Work on a small update adding languages and fixing bugs. This is key, since you can send your game with a free key to gaming media outlets in those new languages. Try finding new media outlets or people who write about the games you made, it seems cozy and cute so i would try finding \"influencers\"/journalists that play those type of games.  \n\\- I would try to get reach out to platforms like twitch prime gaming, or the epic games store and see if they might be interested in having deals with you since your game is already out.  \n\\- Release the game in other platforms/os (macos). Try bringing it to consoles.  \n\\- Go to instagram, tiktok, snapchat and make content about how you make this game and your story. But the game needs to be affordable so interested people don't find friction. (this one is a playing the long game tbh).  \n\\- Pay for ads, but be smart about it, do it close to a new version/platform release.  \n\\- Go to meetups, conventions, local gaming events, showcase your game and do giveaways, give rewards to people talking about it online.  \n\\- Do streams of the game in steam, twitch, youtube. Show people how fun it is.\n\nBy no means this is a failure imo, and you still have the post launch battle. The game is done and that's much more many games can say + the fact people are playing it even at that price is great.\n\nBtw if you end up reducing the price, try compensating existing users with a cool hat or something exclusive to them!\n\n  \n",

The trailer, the Steam images, description, bio; none of it really feels like something I'd spend that much money on. I'd maybe wishlist and wait for a significant sale. My only recommendation moving forward in game development is to start making focus groups. You need to get quality feedback on what people are willing to pay for your games, and you need to do it early on before years of development are put in. Bring people into a very early pre-alpha, let them know the planned scope at release, and have them tell you what price they would be willing to pay for the game. This will give you a good idea on where you should put your focus and how much should be sunk into the game.",

Long dev cycles are way too risky. You can’t make very many games in a lifetime if they all take 7 years. Life is short.\n\nThe Switch audience may like it more. Steam users don’t usually go for metroidvanias unless it’s huge like Hollow Knight or Ori. Steam users also don’t love cute/lighthearted in that genre. Cute and dark works better, or just dark. If you haven’t gone through Chris Zukowski’s visibility and wishlists masterclass on indie game marketing for Steam, you should. He has a ton of insight and a plan for marketing alongside development. I would download all that info into your brain while developing your next game. He basically warns against making this type of game you made because it won’t sell well.\n\nVery sorry you had this experience. The game does look cool to me. I don’t think the price is the problem if there is a lot of content. It is more the visual theme and genre not being a good combo for Steam. I wish you the best of luck on your next game!

          "text": "Disclaimer: I haven't sold any games, I'm just spitballing here, 0 expertise on my side.\n\nThe steam review that highlighted that this game is unique, challenging and engaging and most importantly, that there are multiple \"solutions\", as in, several ways to traverse a room by using items and so on kinda sold me on the game, especially with the claim that they've been having fun playing for 100 hours. Also, the description of the game itself looks fantastic.\n\nBut the trailer... My first worry was that the mice are small and coloured similarly brightly as the background, so they're harder to see... (Metroid had Samus in her orange red suit, hollow knight is bigger on the screen, ori glows and all three have a dark background, making characters stand out; 2D mario wears bright red and while the background is bright, it's very simple, you won't lose track of him). Some platformers may use thicker lines for the ground, but they usually try to make the player stand out.\n\nWhen I look at randomice, the mice are grey and have a similar saturation and line thickness to the background, and perhaps this is because I only watched the trailer on my phone where the screen is too small anyway and I couldn't play the sound, but I worry my eyes will lose track of the mouse...\n\nIt's not a super duper cute mouse like how Hollow Knight is adorable, nor is it a super recognisable character like Mario. The design is simple, not bad at all, and it is still cute (mice are definitely cute and charming) but the style makes me think of an educationsl children's game. Nothing wrong with that ofc. If it was me, I'd gave added basic customization, like letting the player choose to wear a red cape or funny hat or little things like that or something, but this is just my personal preference as a gamer who hasn't even played your game yet, maybe that wouldn't fit with your concept at all, idk.\n\nAnyway, reading the description, the game sounds amazing, but just a look at the trailer without sound (dont have my headphones rn) just doesn't sell the game the way the striking reviews and actual description does. \n\nI find it a bit hard to tell hiw difficult the game is (maybe you can select difficulty? I guess I'll find out), I'd consider buying this for my tiniest brother because there is no violence in this game, just cool challenges, but I'm not sure if the game will be too difficult for him. It's also a game I might gift to my grandma, but idk if it'd be too fast paced for her. I'd definitely play it myself though because it looks very fun and I love character interactions, cute mice, the feeling of everyday spaces as being big and adventurous and ofc,  the thought of a unique game, lovingly crafted for more than 7 years. I love metroidvanias and if the game really has very challenging aspects, levels or settings, I'd share it with my friend who loves figuring out super challenging games. I'd buy the game for 14,99€ for a friend or family member and for like 6-8€ on discount for myself (I feel less guilty for spending so much money on so many games when I buy them as a gift for someone else). If I got the game now and it was indeed as fun as I expect, I'd also pay the current full price for others. But without checking for myself first, I'd be hesitant to buy. \n\nAnyway, I'm no marketing expert, I can't give any professional advice, just my initial thoughts upon a glimpse of the steam page.",

I love randomizers like Ocarina of Time, but part of the fun of that is getting to go to exciting (or dreaded) locations based on the items you get. \n\nFor example, if I get the hook shot I can check the forest temple. In your game if I get the magnet grapple I can get... Up onto those lamps, I guess. I just didn't get that same excitement from a new item, you know? Even the gourmet medal just gives a shortcut into the dining room, not access to it. Maybe the demo is just too small to make it feel adventurous, but I'm just not enticed.\n\nAlso, there aren't any upgrade sort of checks. I'm talking missile packs or energy tanks in a Super Metroid randomizer. Stuff that pads it out. You aren't mad to get extra health or ammo, it makes the rest of the game easier after all, but it isn't exciting. But those little checks that don't matter much make it so much more exciting when you hit the morph ball, or the wave beam. I don't see how a non-combat game can replicate that if I'm honest. \n\nOverall I was promised a Metroidvania with a built-in randomizer. I guess I got that, but none of the presents ever felt really rewarding. And it wasn't promising enough to drop $18.",

And I have the feeling (sorry didn’t do my research yet) that also the visuals would more fit for another platforms. I think consoles would be better fit for your game. \n2) Expectation to Steam platform and game sales. Of course there are a lot of games which sell ten thousands of copies per month, BUT there are even much much much more games which didn’t do it. Hard thing is to realize that there are also good games which complete failed in the market.\nEspecially if considering releasing only on Steam, because Steam is “only” a part of the market.\n\nSo my first impression is that releasing the game on consoles and not only on Steam would lead to better results.",

And looking at the amount of reviews you've got on your store page - it's a decent result!\n\nNow, some thoughts. As many people already pointed out - your price is too high. I see that you're working with a publisher, I'm a bit surprised they let you release at that price tag. 17,99 is not something I'd pay for a cute indie game from a no-name dev.\n\nHave you considered tapping into communities of fans of wholesome / cozy-leaning games? Your art style seems like it would make a great fit, though the game is not exactly cozy. You might want to look into streamers and game events with that in mind, too. Your art style is your main marketing resource here, not your genre, in my opinion.\n\nYour game looks lovely - show it off more in your marketing! Maybe try more visual-focused social platforms? Consider reviving your TikTok - short video format is great for that. Maybe Insta? It can seem intimidating, but do check what successful indie devs are doing for inspo, and start making videos of your own game in similar styles.\n\nThat's all that came to mind right away. I hope it helps!",

I think it’s better to sell emotions and player fantasy instead of doing \"My game is a mix of X, Y, and Z.\" but opinions on this vary.\n\nDid you do marketing? Like sending keys to streamers and YT-people in your niche? Post in targeted subreddits like r/metroidvania? Shorts on Insta, TikTok etc.? Because I never heard of your game. If you developed this over 7 years, you ideally should've started doing the above a few years in. I've read in another comment that you posted like 10 shorts but they never took off, so you gave up. That amount is way too little and it's normal that they perform poorly at first. Unless you get very lucky you have to literally spam these over months/years until things keep sticking and your numbers will grow.\n\nAlso take a look at the reviews, there is often wisdom to be found.",

And get as much feedback from them and ask them number one question before outting a price tag on it , Would you buy the game , and if yes how much would you pay for the experience ? . And then you can set a realistic price that you think the game will sell and make a profit for you .

The game might be good, but id never know. Silksong is very different from this. I confess I am not a 2D platformer person, but I love Hollow Knight, Dead Cells and Carrion. Those games made me try a 2D platform game even though I am not automatically interested in these through their artwork and theme.\n\nI dont mean to roast you, I think you're amazing to pull through for 7 years. But if I am part of your audience at all, I would be lost.\n\nMy idea would be to lower the price for this one and use your tech to create another game that fixes this problem. Its never the first game that makes it. Rarely the second. \n\nAll the best for you, never let yourself be discouraged!",

That's now the price point of household name indies, not a first game release. Is this on the same level as silksong and slay the spire? I doubt it. And that's fine, but price it as such. I was going to buy it from how cute this image was until I saw 20. Should have been 10. I'd suggest price dropping, giving early adapter's something as an apology, putting on a relaunch sale for £8. Worst comes to worst put it on sale for a few weeks at 10.  Best case it does well at its new price, worst case you recoup some losses.\n\n3. Certain ui elements which are visible in the trailer make it look more like shovelware than goty. The font for the names of the mice is the main thing that puts me off in the trailer. Looks very low quality compared to the game itself.  I like the trailer but it doesn't tell me enough about the core gameplay loop. There's a million metroidvanias, why should I care about this one? That's the point of your trailer. Tell me about the gameplay, show off how cute the game and characters are even more than you are. \n\nLooks genuinely fun though, it's a marketing problem.",

However, if it was priced in the £4.99 - £7.99 range I think it would suit this indie style.\n\nBut for the sake of it I looked at the trailers and the pictures. I think there's a lot of promising signs in terms of your abilities. Sometimes you just need luck and to hit the right idea at the right time. If this is a hobby for you and not your main job, I'd recommend trying to make another game, but a different genre, and try to think about the art style a lot.\n\nI put the lack of success down to bad luck, wrong place wrong time, and not an idea that's appealing to people. It's super competitive, and people have a lot of games screaming for their time. I don't think this is an indicator of your abilities as a developer, and I think you have potential to make a game that sells a lot more. The fact is you've had 1 trial and 0 successes. Successful people almost always fail a lot before hitting that success. If it will take you 7 years each time to make a game though, then I'd recommend something else, unless it's your hobby and you love it.",

          "text": "Hey OP, i'm not trying to sound like an asshole here so i wanna preface this, just being super real with you in regards to potentially why your game has declined. \n\nUnfortunately in this day and age, if your game is a metroidvania with no combat, you need some extremely marketable features. It needs to be interesting enough to be successful in youtube shorts and tiktok, it needs to be gripping enough that people would watch streamers play it over something like silksong.\n\n  \nI know mewgenics is not a metroidvania, but if you look at its success, half of it comes from being a solid good game, but the rest comes from the fact its so easily tiktokable and easy for youtube shorts, its got enough random F you moments that people love watching it on twitch. \n\n  \nI would honestly, and i know this is a hard pill to swallow, move on to a new project, perhaps reach out to other solo devs and collab on a project together so the financial and time burden isn't just your own, and use your experience here to make another game. This is a great resume piece, publishers will approach you more, and you dont need to deal with whatever shitty publisher this was that honestly kinda failed you when it came to pushing this title.\n\nDo NOT market a game to just french people. What percentage of gamers are french? A miniscule amount. If Expedition 33 was only marketed to france, it wouldn't have won GOTY.",

Either the price or how the trailer explains the game, etc.\n\nIf I was you, considering you spent all this time on the game, I would try by going for some paid avertising.  \nChange your trailer and show it around and go through a couple of versions until something gets some organic movement and try publicizing that. \n\nIf that doesn't transalte to wishlists maybe then there are other issues like pricing or not appealing to a specific market properly?

McDonalds without their arches as well, and so on, you get the idea.",

Then I started nearing the end of development and realized my game dev Reddit account had to low karma to post anywhere even for advice my marketing skills were fine but not enough and I didn't have the money to make it do more. I ended up spending more time trying to market then working on my game of which I was spending 15 hours a day for months loving every second of development beforehand. That part was so fun the problem solving exciting the seeing an idea slowly forming something I never believed I could do made real was game changing. Then 3 hours of marketing a day was boring and burned me out in a couple of weeks. I need to get back into it from scratch make a few passion projects that show my skill and dedication and just build a small following off of that on like itch io and places like that. Fuck marketing and social media. Also fuck making menus. Coding menus is awful and I'm glad I only had to do it once to have a starting template for life.",

          "text": "I'm gonna have to second \"Find Matt's Cats\" for a few reasons. The issues I have with the considered names:  \n*Matt's Hidden Pets* feels like it demonstrates why losing the \"Cats\" is a non-negotiable. People love cats specifically, you love cats specifically, and it rhymes with your name.  \n*Matt's Lost Cats* does have some trifling with the many compound consonants in the middle. \"slostc\" is a lot to say.  \n*Matt's Missing Cats* is a less egregious example of the above, but does feel a bit tiresome to say a second M word immediately after Matt. Both of these options lose the natural break in the middle that \"Matt's Hidden Cats\" gives you.  \n*Matt's Scattered Cats* goes the other way and I see the appeal, but imo saying the same vowel sound 3 times in a row makes abbreviating the name difficult without dropping your name off the front, likely becoming \"Scattered Cats\" out of necessity, which personally I'd rather not.  \n*Matt's Many Cats* has similar double M problems, though does give your tongue more of a break than \"missing\".  \n\n\n\"*Find Matt's Cats*\" does a few things I like:  \n\\- The first word is \"find\", which is both exactly what you'll be doing in the game, and is a word with connotations of serendipity and discovery and surprise, which is a lighter tone than fixating on what's \"lost\" or \"missing\" (I know we're really splitting hairs but what's in a name).  \n\\- The phrase \"Find Matt's Cats\" is also a direct command. The legendary *Where's Waldo?* pulls you in with curiosity by phrasing itself as a question, and I feel this similarly gets your attention by immediately throwing you into the objective and prompting you to do the thing in the title.  \n\\- All the benefits of the simpler \"Matt's Cats\" can be preserved as it will likely become the common abbreviation when spoken, keeping both your name and the quick rhyme, and at the same time keeping the visual/textual value of the word \"Find\" in defining the objective.  \n\\- The need for a softer word in between \"Matt\" and \"Cat\" is eliminated if there's no word in between them at all. Saying two single-syllable words quickly is much easier than throwing another 2-syllable word that uses the opposite side of your phonic anatomy in the middle.\n\nSo that's my vote lol",

I distinctly remember checking your site every couple of days excitedly watching that progress meter for ebf5, I was so eager to finally play. This series was my childhood and I cant thank you enough for the wonderful memories. Absolutely top tier art style, top tier music and hilariously memorable characters. Finances are tough for me these days so I unfortunately wont be able to buy whatever you title this game (my vote is on matt's many cats!) on launch but I hope I'll be able to pick it up sooner than later!
