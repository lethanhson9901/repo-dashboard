This simple yet brilliant idea made me cry for a few seconds.\n\nA bit of context to explain that feeling better:\nI’m a senior software developer, and I wanted to try some 3D programming. I started three months ago with the Unity Learning Path, and I literally devoured those tutorials as if I had always known how to use the engine. I was extremely happy and felt certain that I would create something cool in my free time.\nSince then, other aspects of my life have been getting harder day by day (relationships, health, money, etc.), and I quickly lost motivation. I realized that I can’t control bad times, but I can keep my mind away from negative thoughts by continuing to improve my personal skills to avoid depression.\nI wanted to find an idea that could bring me back to the old days, when everything was good and problems didn’t exist in my life. I wanted, somehow, to go back to my childhood, but I found nothing....only darkness, like my thoughts. And then your post appeared… and yes, that’s exactly what I was looking for. This really brought me back to my childhood!\nThis somehow turned on the lights again in my mind, and that alone is a W.\n\nThank you for this, with all my heart ❤️",

I haven't found the 4-leaf yet but I needed to come back here to praise you in case I die in this beautiful trap you've created for us.  It's such a simple, lovely idea and it's so perfectly executed!  It's peaceful and pleasing, and those little black spots in the ground give me anxiety, just enough anxiety to contrast with the joy i feel looking around for that clover. There is no light without dark.  I don't know if that was intentional or not, but I feel it and it's real.\n\nThis is a master class in design.  Thank you for creating this and sharing it. ❤️❤️❤️❤️",

So the first boss is a big H for hydrogen and the next boss is a big H with a little curly e tail. And the next is a big L holding a magic rod with an energy ball (the letter \"i\") for Lithium. Each level is named after that element number. You collect all the elements and you'll be able to craft chemicals/alloys to modify your stats (that feature is still a work in progress). \n\nYeah, I have the Kickstarter here: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/starrune/star-rune](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/starrune/star-rune)\n\nAnd you can also join the Discord!

The game can mostly be thought of as 2 parts: \"paths\" and \"battlezones\". For the paths, it's mostly all linear; just like a typing test. But for the battle zones, you battle against mini-bosses called Glitchborn which cannot be typed. Instead you use the Azki (the letters) to form dash attacks to destroy them. You can also hurt them with a jump/spin slash and a meteor attack, as well as your ultimate (which you cast with \\[enter\\] when you have full charge). \n\nThe funnest part of the game is getting create with the battle zones to see just how fast you can desetroy the mini-bosses. There's all sorts of little micro-decisions and interesting choices to make. Do I use my ultimate? Can I finish him off faster by going here and there and there? should i use the spin slash or dash lines for this part? etc...",

You're welcome to play the prototype for free too (link is on the kickstarter page) or join the Discord. You have my utmost respect!!",

It’s brutal to say, but it’s true. This time is usually very short, around 2-3 seconds, which means that your game has to make an impression within that time frame. Therefore, aesthetic is indeed critical.\n\nHowever, a soulless game can be the most beautiful piece of art around, but with “only” aesthetic, it will remain just that: a beautiful, soulless game. I agree that the style could definitely be improved, but when I watched the short clip, I didn’t focus on it. Rather, I focused on the core gameplay idea. To me, this means that your gameplay speaks so loudly that puts other aspects in the background, so to speak. That’s why I stopped to write a comment!",

But I think it was important to not use a lot of pre-made asset packs because they add too much detail which distracted from the letter recognition. And having contrast between the letters and the background is also super important. Because #1 is readability. So I think I found just the right amount of detail (roughly). Still, I think with the right artist, it can go even further haha\n\nAnd yes I do!

The other parts of of the game are mostly linear but in the battlezones, you get to choose which letters to dash to, and it makes for some crazy battles and battles that are really unique to typing, as you have way more options at your fingers than game controllers have; so it gives you this real cool control that is really unlike any other game. \n\nI hope you'll check out the kickstarter and/or join the discord!! :D",

Also it's insanely laggy to render offsets more than 8ish times in each direction, so you can detect the offsettinv by seeing how they deal with distant repeats, which will usually be a white void etc. By the way,   when rendering offsets, one teleporrs the camera to the opposite wall of the finite region whenever they touch it, so that you can't reach the white boundary, maintaining the illusion of moving around in an infinite space",

On the other hand, story is also the one that can keep your content longer for the players especially if they read.\n\nIts not that bad, overall.

When you beat an enemy you get a currency which you can spend to either heal or increase your base stats.\n\nThis allows the player to tweak the difficulty of the game while playing. However, I design all enemies to be very challenging at Level 1. That said the pattern you saw in the demo is not final as I'm still developing the game.\n\nAs for your second point, thanks for the suggestion. I'll consider it.",

Maybe the old one was the one you actually were originally using, but the new one is also AI generated but I guess visually more appealing...\n\nSo you put that together and posted here. Then to drive up the engagement, you've been responding with \"Okay!\" and \"Ok I see\", nonsense filler replies to a lot of people's genuine comments, because you're under the false impression that by doing this, you're driving up engagement on your post and therefore it will perform better for the algorithm or something.\n\nI have some bad news for you (and good news for honest game devs), this is not going to work. Your game is not going to become successful because you use lazy methods of engagement farming to up the numbers on your posts. All you've done is created a mildly \"successful\" reddit post. Which means absolutely nothing for your game sales.\n\nIf I were you, I'd spend less time on engagement farming for upvotes and comment counts, and more time polishing your game and improving the art style. Because the characters in your actual gameplay footage look nothing like either of the characters in your AI generated capsule art images.\n\nFor some reason they are just incredibly generic placeholder characters, and then your actual character has a robot arm?\n\nYou're doing game dev all wrong. It's like you're trying to pump out an asset flip, then prop it up solely on engagement bait social media posts, hoping that somehow all of that will generate lots of sales and you'll be a successful indie dev without actually making a good game.",

The point of the capsule has always been to sell a concept/genre + a feeling, not to show the game. That's what the screenshots are for, and they show up when you hover.\n\nWhat can happen sometimes is that the capsule seems to sell the wrong feeling or is just too much of a mismatch stylistically.\n\nCompositionally, the new one is absolutely better, and it does look a lot more polished and professional, but the style is so devoid of texture that it looks \"bland\" or generic, something common in art that's \"too clean\" or made with AI (not saying it is AI). I think that's why comments say they miss the charm of the first one. However, that doesn't mean the solution is to use the old one as is. A new capsule in a different style or even a touch-up on this capsule will usually still look better.\n\nUsing in-game art without enough editing or *some* artistic knowledge usually ends up looking unpolished and as a result gives the impression that THE GAME is not polished, even though it very well could be!\n\nCharm is good, but you do NOT want your Steam page to look \"amateurish\" regardless of if you are Indie or not. Your capsule is supposed to be the best version of the game, not the one with most fidelity.",

The artists that AI steals from the most and thus have a similar style also have high skill (and often pricetag) to back it up, so they usually don't make janky mistakes or general inconsistencies.\n\nIt's also good to remember that some people's art can look \"more AI\" because AI IS trained on stolen human -- the same way using an em-dash doesn't immediately mean someone is a bot. People were doing these things before. Usually people can still see the soul in something, and as long as something isn't actually AI AND looks decent, most people won't mind it.

It is the reason I despise AI generated imagery to begin with, and it is *glowing* here.\n\nCompare with your screenshot, only the over-the-shoulder belt has a buckle, while the horizontal does not (I'd even assume it's just a waistband, not a leather belt). Now look closer at the belts themselves, look at the *holes*: they are absolutely not uniform in any way that would be reasonable even for a beginner artist, let alone someone demanding that kind of money. The bottom belt has two holes squeezed into the tail, the top belt has  just one. The top belt has four holes setting up a pattern, and there *should* be a fifth hole on the shoulder before it flips out of sight, and because there's a hole on the other end of the vertical belt, there's no \"there are only 4 holes and then it stops\" excuse (unless you think that it's a weird belt that has only 4 holes and then a random hole near the end?). \n\nLastly, I want to draw your attention to the eye shine. The irises are the correct shape, but the shines in each of the eyes are very different (left eye shine is entirely contained inside the iris, right eye shine is 50% inside 50% outside; each of those are correct choices in their respective rights, but I don't think I've ever seen anyone mix them). You can only see it by really zooming in.\n\nTl;dr what I'm saying is, a stranger on the internet is 100% convinced you've been ripped off.",

The cards were rotated towards the viewer and spread out in an easy to read manner. In the final image the hand placement is almost lost at the top of the composition, harder to read and competing in interest with all the red elements.\n\nIf this is a card's game the capsule should make it obvious. If it were me, I'd rotate the king's arm so the hand stays around the negative space below the K (of the King's title). Also I'd make the cards bigger and spread out like they were in your sketch.

The visuals are just stunning, and the intro and everything is very mysterious so great job! It seems your goals are being met. What made me very happy was the local multiplayer mode. I am a huge fan of multiplayer games (I have 5 brothers and 3 sisters, and we often play games together). The audio is great and hitting things is very juicy.\n\nOne note I had was with the splash screen. I've been told that sometimes the Unity splash screen gives people a bad impression because so many trash games were made with it. This might be outdated information but maybe look into that and consider slightly changing it up a bit? Don't get me wrong I love Unity but that's just what I've been told.",

Post on social media often. Have a Discord where you announce updates, show sneak peeks, and more. Also, Reddit is a good place to post because you can actually talk with the community. More on that later.\n\n3. Talk to the community. Like I said before, you can get feedback and stuff from your social medias(Reddit and Discord in this case), so you know what your players want and how to attract more players and stuff. You can also convince new people to play your game by showing that gameplay footage.\n\nI am by no means a professional, but these tricks have worked for other people that I've seen so try these if you haven't already.

This would help validate price and allow customers to be satisfied post purchase.  Way to go on being this far along in the dev cycle!",

Great to see your progress.   \nI really like no 3 and think it has alot of potential so did a quick paint over to what i would do with the pose and perspective.   \nedit: after seeing your trailer i got inspired by your banjo kazoie vibes and screenshoted some of your chunky textures to add to the backdrop for extra roughness.     \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ccrrozgh9khg1.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f935e34bf627a642e8fc27b0f4f9180b94e7b8c\n\nQuick tip when posing, remember its just one angle that need to look good so cheat as much as you can. detach meshes if the rig is to limited, cut off limbs that need posing, add geometry where needed etc. no need to opptimize whats gonna be a single render is what im trying to say.   \n\nGood work :)",

I’ve been gaming my whole life and I’ve never once expected the cover art to look like the actual game, so I dunno why that would change for capsule art.\n\nEdit: do agree that the font looks a bit boring though",

In general, poor shading on the hand.\n* The motion lines should be on the bomb, not the hand. The hand has already stopped moving and the bomb is what's moving through the air because that's how throwing works.\n   * There's actually one action line that I almost missed because it's rendered the same color as the clouds, which is a classic AI mistake.\n* The clouds tilt towards a common reference point, but the shape of the clouds is weirdly flat.\n* The bomb's right leg has the knee pit visible even though that should be hidden by the front of the leg and knee cap.\n* Inconsistent mouth shape on the bomb. The right, camera-facing side only connects in the back, but the other side has the top and bottom meeting on the far side. It's also weird how the bottom jaw is rendered as a highly reflective metal while the top is a pitch black void.\n   * EDIT: Also just noticed, the upper actually makes a convex shape which suggests we shouldn't see any of the pitch black void, there should be background visible.\n\n\\#2 looks great, but upon inspection has a great number of errors which suggests an insufficient amount of attention was put into its creation, which is inconsistent with how good it looks.",

As long as it’s not completely opposite of your game feel, that’s not what you should be focusing on when designing a capsule image or cover art. \n\nLook at Super Meat Bog for instance. Compare the capsule art vs the in game screenshots. Do the same with binding of Isaac. Both very successful games that don’t follow this “rule.”\n\nIf it truly isn’t AI, and can be proven as such, number 2 is the clear choice. Very eye catching. If it is, then find another artist. You might have to shell out a bit more money, but it’s worth it to have a professional design the capsule. Someone who has more experience with it than most people in this subreddit.",

The expression, the clothes, and especially the colors are great.\n\nIn my opinion, the best choice is image #2. I don’t automatically associate it with AI-generated art, and I think this image shows the game’s vibe exactly like you described..\n\nOne small thought: I’d spend a bit more time on the logo itself. Sometimes what makes something feel AI-generated isn’t the illustration but the logo treatment. If the main name “Gonzalo” and the subtitle “the Chicken” use the same font and color, it can accidentally give that impression. Maybe experimenting with more color variation, a more designed font, or making the lettering feel more distinct could make it feel more handcrafted and interesting overall.\n\nI hope this helps.

If you can't do that, you'll only hurt yourself. Scroll through the capsules + screenshots on Steam's front page for a while, then come back to this post.
