In the end, I just had to take down all free content because it was effecting my overall instructor rating. I think it's in the psychology or something. My wife tells me, when people pay for things, they are less likely to complain because if they do, they sort of admit that they did not spend money wisely and it would make them fools.  I just think people are taking a lot for granted and do not appreciate other's people work.  \n  \nI swear man, you start giving away gold, some of them folks will complain it's to heavy to carry",

It's becoming a lot more common than it used to be, but you'll see all sorts of items including games routinely priced at 60% off. A $100 new release on a time limited 60% off sale is generally thought to sell better than the same game with zero discount at 40$. However too high a discount can give the opposite effect of making the product seem defective or discounted because it's not worth full price. It's a balancing act, but marketing has had to come a long way since the Henry Ford Era where consumers didn't have a lot of choice.",

If the game was free then there is no incentive to stick with it to get past that wall of content. If you already paid for it, you are more likely to push through so as not to waste your money.\n\nImagine getting the entire works of Agatha Christie as a gift. Being given each book one by one year after year would be fine but getting the whole lot in one go? That's a lot of reading ahead. If you had bought it for yourself then you went in knowing what you were signing up for but as a gift? Where do you start? Do you even like her books? Do you like them enough to read the whole set or do you try one and decide it's just too much and give up?\n\nI would never give a negative review over something like this but I understand why people might object to it even if I don't believe they should give a negative review for such a reason as the issue is in their head rather than with the product itself.",

You can spend 10 years making a game, but if no one likes it, the problem isn't that you worked hard. The problem is you didn't provide any value.\n\nIt's like spending 10 years digging a hole in the middle of the forest and expecting people to celebrate. No one gives a fuck if you spent 10 years digging a hole. Yeah, it's a lot of effort. It's a LOT of hard work. But people only care about what value you provide for them. \n\nOne of the biggest examples I use in the art community is that no one cares if you draw a picture of your cat. But they will care if you use your skills to draw a picture of their cat. Clients don't want art of you. They want art of themselves. \n\nIf you want to sell a product, you have to provide value that the customer wants. Not value that you want. If you want the praise from the internet, give value to the internet.\n\n\\------\n\nThere's nothing wrong with making a product you want that you like. But keep in mind that the validation has to come from yourself and from inside. Make it for you. Enjoy that you made it. Don't get entitled to adoration from strangers when you did it for yourself. \n\nBe proud of your hole in the forest - for you. Don't expect others to care. You did it for you, not them.",

The additional teeth doesn't really make any of them seem \"scarier\" or anything to me, but it *definitely* makes the one on the far left seem kinda... I dunno. He went from disinterested to looking like he's interested in the smell of his own farts, and I can't really explain why. Something about the jawline shape sorta reminds me of how goofy stupid children get drawn in like, that gross out animation/art style that was popular in the 90s?

So the bottom one almost looks like it's trying too hard. \n\nAlso, mirroring what another poster says, 'showing teeth makes things more scarier' is a trend that's overdone a bit. It can work, don't get me wrong, but here it feels a bit... silly. Especially on rectangle face on the right. Everyone else's grins are small and understated, to an extent, so it makes them feel more sleazy, greasy, if that makes sense. But blockhead there is trying to convince auntie Bettie that no, in face, he does not need to go to the dentist, and is failing that persuasion check.\n\nEnd of the day, both work, but I'd lean more toward the first option.

Or you can make the faces more distorted in the second one, if you want to go for disgust. \nAlso, this style kinda reminded me of Flash animated indie series on youtube called “Courier” (original title: Курьер) by ReminorBand. [Here’s a link to the first episode](https://youtu.be/x9J2A5I1P4o?si=wGWaO34mGz0cwD3N) in case you trust random strangers on the internet, otherwise feel free to look it up yourself. Highly recommend to at least check out first 5-10 minutes, you may get some inspiration from that (you’ll get from what character when you see it).

That’s enormous. Extremely impressive and I’m excited for you to even get reviews. I’m a published author and I’m struggling to get enough readers to review.",

This is better than 90% of people, especially if somebody already plays hours before they leave a review. It means they liked the game, but thought it was not worth the value for the price. The good thing is rather than just disliking and moving on, they told you what would earn a good review.\n\nPerhaps putting in a \"turbo\" mode after a few hours where you can 2x or 3x the speed is a possibility? This might be something you could implement very easily, and that would add additional depth and speed for not a lot of effort. You can also lock it until a certain point to not take away from the main game. Also, adding achievements is a great way to add depth, if you haven't already done so!",

You have so many takes, and subgenres of it, idlers that are simple and just look nice, puzzle games where you have to figure out the best synergies, spreadsheet simulators where you spend 20 hours to eke out 0.5% efficiency gain...\n\nSteam probably shows this game to people that already play idlers, and they have much higher and more specific expectations than the person who has never played cookie clicker before.",

          "text": "Hey! I'm quite a critic on idle and incremental games. They're a very special niche; let's see why:\n\n>Reviews call the gameplay slow, shallow, and uninspired. \n\nMost idle/incrementals are like that. Creating a good, non-repetitive idle game is hard. It's not about adding upgrades, do some maths, and call it a day. FWIW, even famous idles like Cookie Clicker are shallow, and would have worse reviews if it wasn't for _Orteil_, its art, storytelling and release date.\n\n>Feedback from the beta testers (after updates) was the opposite... they found it satisfying and enjoyed the unique engagement mechanics and abilities.\n\nThat's good, but don't create a wat between beta testers and normal players. Both are valuable, and none is more right than the other. Understand both, and if your beta-testers are friends or something, _caution_.\n\n>when people spend eight hours playing then leave their first ever game review just to say my game is bland\n\nIt's an idle/incremental. Most idles can't be reviewed after just 1 hour of gameplay. So don't read roo much into that \"8h\". 8h for your game is 1h for a graphical adventure.\n\n>Or feel entitled to it being free. I spent over 1,100 hours on this and it's less than $4\n\nEntitleness is probably not the word. If some review said that, look at it in a constructive way: many simple incrementals are free. It's just how things are. And it doesn't mean yours have to be. But players will compare anyway. $4 looks good for a normal incremental IMO, but it depends on the specifics of course.\n\nAlso: The time it took to make the game means nothing, remember this.\n\n>especially after the positive feedback from reddit and the testers\n\nWell, consider that \"Mixed\" reviews isn't good, but it isn't terrible. People liked it. And there are always more players than reviewers.\n\nNow, to give you some personal ideas around incrementals, I usually categorize incrementals like:\n- Plain incrementals: Simple repetitive loop. They look good for 20 minutes, then it's the same with bigger numbers. Worst ones; I'll usually add a negative review there, _whatever the price_ (You're not _entitled_ to better reviews even if it's cheap or free!). For example, Time Clickers could fall here, even if it could be in the next step. But it does some things very wrong\n- Normal incrementals: There's a more hand-crafted loop, some more content, but it's still the same mechanic. Cookie Clickers or Clicker Heroes are good examples. They're basic equation solvers, but they have some content where you can waste some time\n- Good incrementals: The kind of game I'll never forget. Incrementals that are _not_ numeric loops. They add mechanics out of the incremental meta, and integrate them nicely. Some examples being Melvor Idle (More idle than incremental), Gnorp Apologue or Leafblower Simulator. They are top tier incrementals I 100% recommend playing to understand the psychology behind the genre. Because they're, in different ways, amazing. And you can 100% complete Gnorp in some hours. But I will pay for it double of what I would pay for a 1000h-length generic incremental.",

It probably wouldn't have succeeded to the same extent if it were an unknown releasing today where expectations for incremental games are higher. \n\nThat might be part of my problem. I took a unique mechanic (automatic idle snakes) gave it a unique hook (clicking/dragging on the screen calls food to the snakes), but then gave it a linear upgrade system where you basically just purchase the next available upgrade that you can afford. No math required, no build variety. I'm really proud of the mechanic, but it feels like it's being held back by the lack of depth. \n\nI actually thought about Gnorp Apologue a lot during development. I really felt like my original idea would put it into the same vein as Gnorp and Tower Wizard. I couldn't find a single other automatic Snake-like game on Steam. Feels like wasted potential now...",

                  "text": "As a consumer of idle and incremental games (not a dev), I wouldn't call \"automatic snakes\" your unique mechanic. That's your theme or skin and is probably the least interesting component mechanically--and I don't mean that to shit on your creative effort--but it could be caterpillars, slime molds, trains, spaceships, conga dance lines, or stars collecting planets and the underlying way the player interacts with the screen would be the same.\n\n\nClick/dragging is a mechanic, but is it really different from most idle mechanics, where active play can be used for higher short term earnings/sec. Like, for how the mechanics affect what actions someone is taking, or the choices it presents, how are your snakes different than drone+manual tapping in obelisk miner?\n\n\nFor unique hooks or mechanics, I think of something like Kittens, where taking some research paths blocks other upgrades. Or how terraformential has a rogue-like puzzle component to it that makes each \"prestige\" functionally different and not just \"numbers go up\". Or there was one I forget the name of where you chose skills to boost either idle or active play until the next prestige.\n\n\nFrom just watching the video, I would say the thing that attracted me most was the hypnotizing visuals of the snakes moving around. I would like to see you explore THAT as your unique hook. Can you upgrade different movement patterns? Extra visuals? Pulsing colors or lights?\n\n\nAny way, congratulations on your release! You've got something solid. But just need dig a bit more into what is resonating with people and expand on that.",

Probably less of a steep hill than if you released those features post-launch.\n\nIf you intended for it to be barebones (in your own words!), then it would probably have done poorly without the updates. As a consumer, being above barebones seems more like a minimum requirement than a bonus.\n\n\n\nRegarding the reviews and feedback:\n\nI wonder if maybe the snakes moving so fast in the trailer could be part of the reason some people assumed the pace would be higher?\n\nThe description mentions it's slow, but it also makes it sound like it's supposed to be more like other idlers that focus more on content and upgrades, and which usually also take a while to beat. The people who didn't seem to have that expectation enjoyed it, so perhaps you can tailor your page text and trailer to the more casual/chill demographic even more.\n\nHone in on things like the fact that it's relaxing, can be played while listening to YouTube or music, and doesn't demand a lot from the player. And mention that it's intended to be beatable in a short amount of time (sometimes a short game is better!)\n\nYou could also go in the opposite direction and try to add more content and depth, but I'm under the impression that that wasn't necessarily your intended focus.\n\n\n\nBased on the page, the reviews, and some of the comments on this thread, here are my ideas for some things you could consider for the next update:\n\n* Maybe increase the progression speed slightly in the very beginning and then even it out.\n\n* Consider whether some more things could be unlocked by playing or reaching certain milestones instead of being there from the start. Should make it feel like there's more progression.\n\n* \"Butts\" gives some UI pointers that should be pretty painless to implement, so that's a good place to start!\n\n* Bai Laishu also gives some ideas for more prestige/post-game mechanics, from the perspective from someone that finished AND already enjoys the game.\n\n* Perhaps saving snake colors instead of resetting them/looking out for other potential cheese mechanics could help too even if just slightly to help add weight to choices (as long as that wouldn't mess with any core mechanic).\n\n* Look over your steam page description/marketing. Hone in on your intended audience instead of trying to please people looking for a different experience altogether.\n\n* Edit to add because I forgot: might also be good to look over your particles and event feedback in case you can add more \"juice\" or impact anywhere. Could also help feel rewards more rewarding.\n\n* Test a bit more if you can after you're done making changes to make sure you didn't miss anything.\n\nAnd after your updated version is ready, make a post in your Steam community announcing the new update and thanking people for their feedback, and consider responding to some of the negative reviews just to inform them (and people reading those reviews in the future) that the issues described have been fixed or improved upon. Just to inform and maybe thank personally.\n\nFor some reviewers it might be enough to update their review and even if they don't, future players will see that you care about the quality of the game and some of those reviews aren't necessarily relevant anymore. :)\n\n\n\nIt looks neat, keep it up and hopefully you can bounce back to positive! Good luck with this and future endeavors.",

Different people like different games, and fans of fast paced action rpgs probably won’t enjoy your slow idle game, no matter how good it is, because that’s just not their niche. \n\nThat’s fine and not something you can change, but if 45% of your players are the wrong crowd, you should look into how that happened. Did you bundle it with the wrong game? Did your trailer suggest it’s more action packed than it is? SOMETHING probably made people who are not the idler crowd buy your game and then it’s no wonder that they didn’t like it.

That means you're close, you're just not 100% there yet.\n\nLooking at the steam page and reviews, most of these sound reasonable so there's probably some good information and feedback to mine here. Like it or not, things like prestige mechanics and unlock progression are expected in incremental/idle games. I don't think you need a hundred layers of different mechanics, but enough that someone could see something new every 10-20 minutes for about 2 hours at least. \n\nI don't know what's present now without playing it myself, but broadly players need new goals that unlock new things. Prestige once, get a flat multiplier. Prestige 3 times, trade in points to unlock challenges. Complete challenges to add a new food type, etc. Egg inc and revolution idle would be great comparison points.\n\nI think the general play area presentation is spot on, no notes. It's cool watching the snakes run around and the mess of numbers.\n\nThe UI on the right needs some work. A bit more conveyance (darken button when you don't have enough money) and more definition to the buttons themselves perhaps. RGB color scheme with buttons shaded on all sides comes across as really default. The link below has some good examples- directional lighting artifacts, heavy bottom shading to sell 3d depth, unique borders, etc.\n\nhttps://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/buttons-set-211824?srsltid=AfmBOopNNgjuwcda5urr2MY5yObp_wcQvOp0TovmJSU0SEE1c7wTTER9\n\nAgain, you're close! People want to like this game or they wouldn't be leaving reviews. Push a bit further, add some additional features, regroup. When you finish the new features, make a community post inviting people to try v1.1 but wait until you're confident you've crossed that 2+ hour mark so you don't burn good will.",

You made a slow meditative incremental idler and some players are complaining that it is slow and predictable, which just means they were not the target audience. Eight hours played and then saying it is not worth it still means the core loop held their attention hence beta testers and Reddit feedback are biased toward the genre and toward you the general store audience is harsher and compares your game to everything they have ever played and spending 1100 hours does not entitle a game to praise because players review experience not effort. Early reviews are usually the harshest because dissatisfied players speak first while okay or mildly satisfied players stay silent. If multiple people call it shallow or generic that is not negative criticism it is usable design information. The only real mistake would be taking it personally or ignoring repeated criticism. Learn from your mistakes so your next game reviews are overwhelmingly positive.",

Each piece of advice is feedback you can use to make this game the best possible version of itself, and I find that framing to be so much healthier.  Sure, it sucks to have something you thought was awesome getting mixed reviews, but it's all feedback and that's not bad.\n\nTangentially, if the public reception is this wildly different from the tester reception, I think you've probably got a bigger disconnect going on here.  The testers weren't representative of the final audience, which strikes me as either bias in the tester selection or the game was marketed to the wrong audience.",

Not delivering the kind of experience that I thought I was.\n\nI designed the game for an idle market that doesn't seem to exist anymore. Everything I did was too simple and antiquated. I was fatigued by deep systems, talent trees, and layered gameplay elements. I sort of thought other people would be fatigued too, and my game would find a niche in the idle space because of that. Maybe it did, but the game is clearly polarizing.",

Long story short, at the end of the book he finishes the race in last place and, while he is hard on himself about it, his friend points out that there are a lot of trucks that flipped over or otherwise didn't even make it to the end of the race. His hero pulls up next to him and praises him for having gumption and pulling through to the finisb. Everybody else stood out in the spotlight, but his superpower was fighting through to the end no matter what obstacles he faced.\n\nI have started developing several games and have not even come close to ANYTHING shippable or even playable. I saw the obstacles that looked like they were going to prevent me from shipping the end result I was imagining and (partially due to ADD) moved on to the next thing.\n\nYou might not have finished with the result you were hoping for, but MANY people before you haven't even finished the race at all. You are way ahead of most people who aspire to release a game and if you have gotten this far, you have something special. I don't know if you will ever be successful as an indie dev, but I know you won't be if you count this as a loss rather than the very reall win it is. Read the comments, learn the lessons, and get better.\n\nBest of luck!",

You can't please everybody, people are prone to deciding what a game should be before they even play it, and if it doesn't fit the rigid idea they've formed, they get upset.\n\nYou can't fix this, but making the trailers and description as accurate as possible may help. \n\n2. Read the reviews with a critical (but not defensive) eye. A lot of negativity in reviews is not exactly in good faith. (i.e. they complain about performance when running a pc with less than half of the minimum specs, or they're upset that a game specifically marketing as a slow paced trading game is a slow paced trading game instead of the first person shooter they wanted.) \n\nThat said, there can be a whole slew of complaints that you are developer-blind to, and it can be very worth making efforts to address these complaints.\n\nImportantly, if you do respond to a review -- be polite, non-defensive, and earnest. Don't respond at all to people with nothing actionable to say.\n\n3. Get as many hands on the project as you can - before asking for their money. My game for example launched in a pretty rough state, despite having a playable demo out for more than a year prior to release. I can't even imagine how much worse it would have been had it just been me testing things out on 1 or 2 machines.\n\nAlso - having a demo may well insulate you from \\*some\\* of the negativity, as people who are immediately disinterested are less likely to buy refund and review.\n\nIf you've got eyes on the project, run betas/etc prior to release if you can.\n\nLastly - looking at your game things aren't dire. Many of the negative reviews list positive features, and the general feeling is that the game doesn't scale much for an idler game and has minimal content, with some even acknowledging that the game could get better over time.\n\nImo responding gracefully, (and publicly), with your intentions to address criticism/add content/etc -- may well turn things around.",

Obviously all of us artists wish that our art was received by everyone as well as we like it ourselves. The irony however is that we are also our worst critics. So when we are actually happy with our work, it can be that much more hurtful when there are worse critics than ourselves.\n\nSo yeah, in my experience that pain will never go away, although it may very well subside substantially.

Life growing up may have been incredibly cruel, they may have felt like an outsider or undeserving of even being in the same class as fellow students who they thought made much better art. And honestly, the “first official work“ that was released to rave reviews most certainly wasn’t actually their first release work. They may have gotten negative feedback on their art in art school by their fellow students or teachers or advisors. Maybe everyone liked it except the one person who is opinion really mattered to them like their spouse or parent.\n\nThere are a lot of moving parts in the world of art, and sadly I feel like those moving parts tip the scales negatively in our favor almost all of the time. It’s always a struggle, it’s always an uphill battle. another thing I have taken to heart for so long as a filmmaker was when someone framed the way to be a successful filmmaker to be literally obsessed with it. You have to be obsessed to make films because the road is so rough. All the rejection, all of the problems, the costs, the time… Any other person would give up immediately.

You don't know what people's expectations were when the bought the game - based on images, video, price, or whatever text the read (assume no one but you has actually read your whole text): 18 reviews might be too early, and you need more of your target audience to try the game.\n2. You don't know what type of player bought the game - if you wanted idler players to buy it, but someone picked it up because they assumed it was closer to a factory game (as an example), the feedback might be valuable, but you have to adjust the lens you see it through.\n3. Maybe you made the wrong game for the right audience - the things you like about the idea are actually closer to what the feedback is looking for, in which case the feedback could be ultra helpful if you're willing to lean into the things they're looking for.\n\n  \nTo be a bit reductive, imagine you're a restaurant. You're going to serve this dish every day, to new people, for a year. Every time someone walks in the door and gives you feedback, you either:\n\nhave an artistic goal, and you need to learn which feedback to reject: you don't want to be laid astray by people that were looking for something else, but happened to walk in your door,\n\nor you have a technical goal, and you want to make the best version of a dish that people like: it's your job to filter out the reviews to figure out who is providing feedback that is going to help you refine your direction.",

But from the reviews, it seems like it lacks a lot in progression. It is still a game, and therefore does need progression to some degree, even if it's slow. \n\nIf I could recommend, I would suggest making a lot of the unlocks locked behind progression, add some more content with progression, and slowly expand the map, and maybe even play on the idea of planets and galaxies since you're in space. Just some ideas. It has a lot of potential as a game for sure, so definitely just take the reviews as criticism. Remember, they paid money and gave your game time. Negative review or not, they tried it out, and therefore your game has potential at face value.\n\nGood luck!",

Yet, it's also an opportunity to learn how others interpret your design, data, framing, interpretation, etc. It definitely stings, but the fact that you completed something compelling enough for people to spend time and money on it is a great accomplishment. There's a lot of stuff out there (great and garbage) that people never discover. You did enough things right to intrigue people to buy and play it. Also, it's still early. You just released it and reviews are just like any other type of data -- unstable at small sample sizes. If it's still mixed when you have 10x the number of reviews you have now, then that is more telling than your current reviews. \n\nAlso, some games aren't always as great as they could become at the initial release... some devs just want to get something out, get a feel for what players like/dislike, and then transform it into a better version of what they originally intended. \n\nI know nothing about your game or you (other than what is in your post), but I think it's rad you had an idea, built the game, and released it. That's more than most ever do, and your game might be totally awesome. It's just too early to tell and there's a lot to celebrate already.

Good start.\n\n-It looks very lovely - my partner walked into the room while it was on my screen and went \"oooh, what's that? Link it to me\"\n\n-It promises to be fairly short (which is good for me, my favourite game of the last few months was Execute, which was a £5 four-hour game with a great idea that got in and out quickly and didn't waste my time. Love it). You aren't hiding the 100% achievement completion behind thousands of hours of pointless repetition like some idle games.\n\nBad:\n\n-Your priorities seem to be in very strange places, which come across as very inexperienced - for example, why do you have a playable piano when your upgrades aren't greyed out when the player can't afford them? \n\n-You have a prestige mechanic hidden in a strange place which seems to be quite half-baked?\n\nAs I said, I've played 4 hours, at this point I'm fairly content to just leave it as a wallpaper on my third screen occasionally clicking back in order to work on the task list, there doesn't feel like an incentive to do any more, and the very little interaction the game does have requires me to look closer at the game to figure out what I can/can't afford. \n\nI had fun with it, and I don't regret the purchase. I will try to remember to leave a positive review to help out once I 100% it. It's a perfectly fine first attempt, so many people do so much worse and never get better. Stick with it.",

Way too many variables to even start to worry about.\nOne example being half-life. But those are so ultra rare that it even overshadowed bunch of legendary games of its time.\nAnd the devs were seasoned already to begin with, just in different program type :p\n\nNever chase the high, we humans often focus too much on that. It's normal and okay, but not the way when it's too big of a focus. Too much of anything can be bad anyway.\n\nYou are doing well, don't worry about it! And you are allowed to feel bummed about it too, but also definitely should feel bunch of positive feelings from the good things you learned and did through it(as many pointed out)!\n\n55% is awesome especially with that amount of reviews! Also, hopefully one of your future projects will be even more enjoyed by whoever wants to enjoy them! I sometimes find some games that have like 98% rate and i couldn't care less, cuz they aren't for me and so i don't even try them because id not like it.

Understand that play testers and \"guy who saw your game on steam\" are two different types, and the first category will usually be softer on you because they consider your game unfinished. Shipping any game at all is a huge achievement. Recognize that your criticism is a gift in the long run and you'll be unstoppable.",

It's okay that the pacing is slow but it doesn't really feel like any signifigant depth opens up as you play. Even as a relaxed idler it feels shallow. For games I'm usually aiming for $1-2/hrs of enjoyment. For an idler I'd expect more hours because my play itself is more dilute and hands off. I think this game falls short of that. The game has neat visuals but I feel with the current complexity it would be hard to justify buying this versus any other free more involved idle game. As a player keep in mind I don't get to see the 1000 hours of effort that went in, all I see is the final product.\n\n\nEven though it is a zen and relaxing game, that doesn't mean it needs to lack complexity or meta progression. I think that is the biggest disconnect between you and your more critical reviews.\n\n\nThis review might sound a little harsh but I'm just trying to be honest to help with your next game.

Moving on to another game is always one of the most difficult decisions for me because I know I am usually making a 1-3 year commitment to have a game running on my computer 99% of the time. For me, idle games should be low in graphics and be pleasant to have up on my screen for the entire duration. I specifically target incremental games like yours, but if I were looking for a new game right now, I wouldn’t choose it because it appears to be too graphicly intensive. If you want some examples of successful incremental games, look at NGU Idle, Trimps, and Melvor Idle as examples of a game someone will want to keep up all of the time. \n\nI hope you have great success in your game dev endeavors however and I hope your game becomes the next big thing.

People want more prestige levels, they want more snakes, they want their upgrades to feel like they matter. They dont want a faster beefier game, but they want to be able to play it instead of having it as a screensaver.\n\n\nAlso, I haven't played your game.

What I read from those comments (as an objective eye) is that they were excited about the game from what they saw in the trailer (like me) but when it came to playing, they felt very passive. So what I infer from that, is that you took \"idler\" a bit to literal and didn't give them too much agency on the game. And if you remember the flow chart, if you don't have even a little challenge (or at least the illusion of a challenge, as one commentor said) you fall into boredom. I kinda agree with you, that people should relax a bit with a 4 Dollar game. But at the same time, to them it feels like they paid 4 dollars for a glorified screen saver. In the end, an idler game, should still be a game. (I haven't played it, so I don't know if that is a valid point, but that's what I read from the comments)\n\nAlso, congratulations for getting so many reviews in so little time. I released 2 weeks ago and have 3 reviews. Doesn't feel that great too \\^\\^°",

That's a serious achievement! \n\nI'm sure you understand this already, but making a game feel \"good\" is incredibly challenging. Even AAA studios with almost unlimited funds get this wrong all the time. \n\nTim Cain said in a video recently that games are as much art as they are a product, which I wholeheartedly agree with. Art is subjective, and unfortunately, this time around, a lot of people didn't like your game for whatever reasons.\n\nYou can continue to support the game, taking on their feedback and improving it, or you can call it here and work on a new project. Either way, you'll have new experiences to take with you so you can hone your craft :)",

          "text": "Ah, I'm sorry that's happening. My suggestion is to try to make the best of it though. Make sure you read the reviews and see what people are criticising. If there's room for improvement in your game and the reviews are giving constructive criticism, maybe work toward implementing fixes/improvements into an update.\n\nThere are major big budget games that have released with terrible average review scores, and they've spent time updating their games and fixing things, and eventually completely turned things around and now get raving reviews about how great the games are. No Man's Sky is a perfect example of that.\n\nDon't get discouraged. I think it's awesome that you were able to release your game after working on it for so long. It's great that you actually have a game finished and released and out there for people to buy. It's something to be proud of, and if there is room for improvement in your game and you can take the constructive criticism and turn it into something even better, it could be a great opportunity. Now that the game is finished and playable, working on some updates and new content for it would be a great way to bring more attention to your game and change people's opinions on it.\n\nDon't underestimate how valuable your updates will be once the people who bought your game see you working on it. Gamers have a ton of respect for developers that actually take their comments and criticisms to heart and turn them into updates in the games. Having a customer see their suggestion put into a game is awesome and makes your players feel like they're being heard and listened to, and can really turn things around.\n\nUpdate: I was curious, so I went out and read some of the negative reviews. Honestly, there is some actual constructive criticism in these, so you might be able to turn some of these into a positive. If you do decide to make some changes and push an update, make sure you go to the negative review that inspired it, and post a comment in response to the player, so they know that you made an update based on their feedback.",

I didn't hate my time with this game, but it also did not really feel like much of an experience either. It's pretty, it's streamlined, it runs well, but you don't ever do anything new and, strictly speaking, you don't do anything at all except occasionally upgrade a thing. That loosely describes most idle / incremental games, but there is usually some illusion of choice or direction, some incentive to look and pay attention. That does not exist here. Maybe worth a couple dollars for something you have in the background for a day.\n\nSo, first off, that's not actually negative as they say it's generally more neutral. 55% being mixed reviews reflects a similar level of neutral to me so that's something.\n\nYou may have set out to simply make this without much to do, or you just weren't sure what all could go into it to make it feel more interesting without betraying that calm slow meditative take. That said, I do think it's important to give people something to do even in games that may on their surface be against that premise. Definitely spend time in the space you want your game to live within and see what does well and what doesn't. Also, when conducting testing research you need to come at it knowing people can be more positive when they know they're talking to the developer and are being asked to test things vs having spent money on something and being able to recommend that to other players and not be giving feedback to developers. Also, you need to remember to ask questions that can help guide what you should be doing. If someone says the game is relaxing and cute, for example, you need to probe around what it may be lacking, whether or not they would feel compelled to play this for longer than 10-15 minutes, what it feels like compared to other games in the genre/approach. Market research is tough, and there's a reason people spend a LOT of money and time conducting it properly. That's not accessible for a lot of indie devs, so remember to try and push people when you have them and get what you can out of it.\n\nNow the question is, do you iterate on this game and try to add things or tweak things based on what the responses are saying, or do you take it to heart and move on to your next game. Either way, congratulations on getting a game out there that people have played enough to leave reviews for! So many just fall into obscurity.",

Two more say almost the exact same thing. Could you restructure things so mechanics are unlocked in a more progressive fashion? 15-20 minutes of gameplay is not acceptable for a paid game.\n\nAnother says there appears to be a serious flaw in that you can cheese the mechanics by resetting all the colours by reloading? I'm not sure what that means in context but it sounds like it breaks the main gameplay loop.\n\nSome other comments are saying that this is a marketing issue, that the wrong people are finding your game. But if incremental idle fans are finding your game and think it's too shallow, then I have to wonder is there *any* market for a game where you *do* so little? If you're combining slow *and* meditative *and* idler is it really a game at all or just a screensaver?",

          "text": "Hi u/OldAtlasGames, just had a quick look at the reviews and at least they seem to give great feedback. Combined with all the great replies you have that seems to be a great start for a potential next step that could be adjusting the game to the reviewers expectations if you like. \n\nIf you'd like to try and do something like this I may - albeit I say this as a gamer, not a professional - change the games description to add a big fat update notice on top that says that you've listened and changed these and those points to improve the game and make it more exciting or sth. along those lines.\n\nAt the same time I'd place a discount that lowers the price to sth. like just 1$. So low, people may simply buy it because why not. This has multiple advantages: You show up in the list of heavily discounted games, reching a wider steam audience. You get more sales and reviews, every single gamer may recommend your game. The expectations for a game that is just 1$ are way lower than those for a 4$ game. Ideally reviews may say that they'd even buy it for those 4$. Once you have reached that level, you may end the discount and see how income and reviews develop from there.\n\n\\------------\n\nWhat you could also ask yourself for future ventures is why the beta testers and the steam clients view the game that differently. Biggest question you could ask yourself here is: Who were the beta testers? Were they friends? Always a bad idea. They most likely tend to rate your work more favourably than internet randos. I would too, simply because I'm already excited that my friend has made something cool. I want it to be cool, because you are my friend. Hence I'll potentially look over lots of potential issues that others see more clearly.\n\nOr were they perhaps random fans your game gathered during the development phase? That may come with similar issues.\n\n\\-------------\n\nThis too reminds me of an episode of the TV series \"Silicon Valley\" that is loosely inspired by real-life events. There the protagonists do a closed beta for their app and get overwhelmingly positive feedback. Then their VC associate tests it and is not exactly excited. They launch and fail miserably: Nobody gets the app. Turns out their mistake was that they exclusively invited friends from software engineering and didn't realize that a trained engineering brain has an easier time navigating their to others rather convoluted UX than random B2C users. Oops.\n\nAlways try to get beta testers who are closest to actual potential buyers. Easier said than done of course. The game looks definitely pretty cool and I'm tempted to give it a try, even if it's just for the sake of supporting your ventures a tiny little bit :) Have fun, don't let this first experience draw you down, see it as helpful feedback to improve or well, change to cater towards your gamers & furthermost: Keep it up, enjoy your great venture!",

With idlers/incremental, oftentimes make things less convenient than you think they should be at first so \"baseline\" game loop feels like an upgrade. \n\nI dont think your game is cooked at all, try and update, tell people you have listened to their feedback, and see where it goes. If it is cheap to gate or add content, do a bit of that and market it as 1.1. \n\nDude, 20 reviews already puts you well into the top half of steam AND you shipped a cool looking little game. Be proud of yourself, take the feedback, and apply it to your next title after you're done updating this one.

I'll bet some people who left negative reviews on that game played even more than I did. \n\nEnjoyment of a game is pretty subjective and you never know what will or won't click with a specific player. Some games just aren't for some players and sometimes one or two specific issues (Monster Hunter Wilds' poor graphical optimization, for example) can result in a deluge of negative feedback. It's not that that feedback isn't valid, but it has a wildly outsized impact on the overall score and perception of the game. I never even left a Steam review for MHW because I felt generally pretty happy with it and don't leave reviews for anything unless there's something very specific to say (good or bad).\n\nAnd ultimately: you have a game on Steam. That's a massive achievement on its own (congratulations!) and means you are sitting there alongside games like Monster Hunter, and are getting feedback on your game in the same way they are, and I TOTALLY get how difficult and demoralizing some of that would feel, but that's also an amazing opportunity to have moving forward with whatever you choose to do next, whether that's continuing to work on this game or build something brand new, etc.",

Show up a few more times and then make sure to pop into a few more streams afterwards. If you can, make it a habit of popping in occasionally when they stream. Don’t just be a “one and done” person cause even if they let you drop your game, they won’t shout you out when you’re not there unless they like you. You wanna aim for steamers around a few thousand followers or more. Small enough to talk to but big enough where they’re clearly taking it seriously. Make it a daily habit to find a new steamer or interact with someone you’ve already met. Make sure their friend streamers get to know you as well. Make sure you keep looking for streamers outside of their friend group as well otherwise you’ll get promoted to the same audience over and over and over cause a lot of streamers have the same fan base as their friends.",

With all due respect, that will singlehandedly be the reason this game never sees the light of day.\n\nMaybe a really good game, but unfortunately most people will never know.\n\nMost games in this space don't even ask for anything over $15 at full price. And even that's pushing it. At $10 this game would sell like hotcakes. It would be an impulse buy for a lot of people.\n\nYou also need to consider how that converts to different countries, as a lot of your audience might not even reside in the US. If it's too high for us here, it's probably unobtainable elsewhere.\n\nDifferent type of game, but even Stardew was only asking 15, and theres a lot to offer there.\n\nBest of luck!",

I remember it was a very simple interface, and you mostly just watch the bugs fight without any input, but very difficult to get past the first two fights. I am honestly not sure that the game was real or if I just dreamed it up, because I haven't been able to find it for years.",

Also, in a sense it is more descriptive of the game's vibe and visuals, I think (the fog, the strong impression of chilly air, the strong saturated colors with deep dark blue in the background and occasionally red-lit monsters).\n\nHowever, when in the store (the setting where it must fulfill its function), the new one works wonders - it would all look too oppressive perhaps with the old capsule, ahaha. The new one is more friendly, and 'in small' / as thumbnail it looks better. Ahaha maan, capsules are haaard.\n\nHope the gods of marketing smile upon you and you get tons of sales aaaa",

It's unfindable on Google as it always returns Deathloop instead of your game. Seems like quite a big SEO issue. Not sure how to fix that without changing the name of your game though but maybe someone else here has advice for that.\n\nThe big problem with this is that you are gonna lose a big percentage of the people that find your game somewhere online in a video or screenshot and all they have to go on is the name. Many will not bother to launch Steam and look it up there in the search, a part will, but a part won't. So you are definitely going to miss out on a chunk of potential sales due to this issue. If I was you I would take this seriously and fix this before release",

It may not look like much, but every technical subsystem that needs to be specialized is written for the target platform: achievements, session management, persistence, keyboard input, etc.\n\nThe other big reason is that this is our fourth game and we’re starting from an infrastructure framework that we’ve built over time. One of the biggest parts is the system that lets us write data to Google spreadsheets and automatically get all the data organized into ScriptableObjects in Unity. It’s a pretty complex system that we’ve been carrying around since our second game.\n\nAnother very large part is the automated testing system, our custom internal localization system, and lots of small tools that help us during development.\n\nSo in short, most of the project doesn’t even get compiled into the final game, it’s there to support the development pipeline or to handle other platforms.",

Thank you so much.  \nI just put the samples on a very very low number (I use maya + Arnold) and then I use a toon shader and lights to exagerate highlights and make sure the shape of the character is readable with low sampling. \n\nI then place a rotating camera around the character and render each frame.\n\nI use a free software called \"glue it\" that creates the spritesheets out of the renders. That's pretty much it for these rotating gifs. \n\nFor the game is way more complex because the you can swap the arms, head, chest and legs of the character, so for that we render every limb separately in all poses and that generates a ton of sprites. I export them as PSB files and add bones in unity. It's a bit of a nightmare but after a bunch of characters is just a repetitive process!",

Each one registers a set of \"Services\" to the application/game object.  \n\nFrom within TerrainManager:\n\n    game.register(\"getTerrainHeightAt\", (x, y) => { .... });\n\nthen any other class can just say \n\n    game.call(\"getTerrainHeightAt\", x, y);\n\nthen you can just add and remove systems easily without having to update references everywhere.  also your classes can handle the case when the call returns null/undefined and not care whether or not the other class exists.\n\nthis allows you to make re-usable systems across multiple applications because they are self contained systems that dont care about the rest of the application.",

Feels a bit more spotless than the old one due to it being more busy. \n\nI believe a combination of both approaches would be cool. Show Sisyphus holding the bolder with his sholer and arm, smiling towards the camera on his side or behind him with a thumps up. Make the live streaming aspects camera view aspects VERY obvious like in the new one. Maybe add hands like someone is holding the camera and their fingers or entire hand is kinda overlapping the camera. Makes the player feel more engaged by looking at it and conveys the aspect of streaming yourself more obvious. Make the background less busy like in the old version.

The little beak is probably the most recognizable part of this design so you don't want to cover it up.

I don't know what kind of game you're making so this might not even be relevant, but if you've got like an invincibility powerup then the full face mask look could be a fun extra detail for that. Just a thought.\n\n  \nBut if I was going to pick just one as the best, I'd probably go with A1.",

Also I would say anything from A1 to A3 are good choices. The final decision should depend on the way your character is setup. If you want a less experienced rookie knight then go with A1. A3 looks more hardcore with the sharper cheek plate so it would represent a more experienced and badass version of the character. A2 on the other hand is a fine balance between the two. Every other version you lose too much detail and the character becomes more generic. But like I said where the character is currently in their story should be the deciding factor. \nHope this helps",

The odd one is fine if you’re attempting to understand a concept (recommend Sebastian Lague) but don’t copy them.\n\n- Don’t go small - I know the advice is too “make pong” so that you get a finished game but that never motivated me. I got bored really easily so I ended up not caring. Also don’t build your dream game. Go for something that you could theoretically build in 3 months on something that interests you. You like strategy? Build a Tower Defence. You get the idea.\n\n- Limit yourself time wise - don’t push yourself to do as many hours as you can, you’ll just burn out. Do a maximum of x hours a day and write down what you want to accomplish in those hours. You’ll find that you’re more excited to go back to it. Also, time away from a problem helps you reevaluate it with fresh eyes 😊\n\nGood luck!",

Surely a lot of aspiring game devs' first dream is to work in some big companies and be involved in some AAA games, which is not realistic and achievable in a short term.\n\nBut a lot of times, we just have some simple ideas, mechanics, that we are not seeing in any game and we want those custom made. In that case, I'd say do build your dream game, or some simpler variations of it (so it ties back to your pointl).\n\nI guess one of the most important and universal advice for this industry is that, build something you truely love and want to play yourself. If it's not about the survival of your company or anything, like your life depends on it, then nothing else really matters that much honestly if you're passionate about it.",

You can take this pretty far down. Then you can tackle these subtasks if you find it is still too big you can subdivide it on the fly. You'll feel the progress if you can strike through even just a simple subtasks. It will boost your energy. \n\nThese subtasks can be as simple as \"implement WASD movement\", \"Make a popup\", \"Make character jump\", \"Do one sword sprite\", \"Do a pickup sound\". \n\nAnother advice is to not overthink if what you are doing is right.  Make it crappy first, you can polish it up later.  As your experience grows making old stuff better will be much easier. \n\nIf you are stuck on one problem go the next one maybe you'll find the solution while working on something else. \n\nAlso taking breaks is not bad. Take a breather once an hour/30 minutes. Set a timer for one hour in which you'll work on the game and then set a timer for the breather as well. Maybe also play a game which you can pause or has short levels. Or just go outside for 5 minutes.

A licensed therapist genuinely is much more than just venting to a friend, to strangers, do a rubber duck, etc. A lot of people look down on therapy and think they're above it and can help themselves, or that therapy isn't for them or won't work. If you have coverage for it, it can be really nice. \n\nI'm personally happiest when I'm learning something new and pushing toward a goal. A few months of therapy when I was younger put me in the headspace I needed to be in to find that motivation. I may not always be in that headspace, but it helped me find it in the first place and find how to get there more consistently. Now, it's just about building healthy habits and avoiding social media except for breaks like now.",

I looked it up in the manual for the IDE, or Google, or stack overflow. I take notes, I put tons of comments to explain to myself what I'm thinking/doing.\n\n\nIn my free time I watched videos on coding principals and good code habits. Or listened to podcasts about game design, etc.\n\n\nIf I coded something, I would try to remake it in 3 different ways. e.g. state machine, nested if statements, more function-based, more object based, just whatever variations I could think up as 'homework'.\n\n\nI liked the loop of getting stuck and having a breakthrough, though. If failing bums you out, it's much harder to go far with a skill. Program to be better tomorrow, not to be great today.\n\n\nEdit to add: playing games that require you to think like a programmer like factorio or spacechem can be good to learn abstracting problems and reframing stuff. I often think of my code as a little factory with different pieces working together. If you still see matrix code instead of blonde, brunette, redhead... Maybe those games will put you in the mindset.",

You have to understand that failing is part of the learning process and Game Development is really high skill field (depending on what you want to achieve). Maybe baby steps are boring but they usually provide you with fundamentals. \n\nYou have a knack for writing though! You can do this. I recommend you start with stuff you like doing. Maybe you are a writer, or a painter, maybe you'd rather learn how to make 3d models or pixel art or something.\n\nGame development isn't just opening a game engine and program gameplay. Maybe for starters, why dont you sit down and physically design your game? Like open a text book, start writing your story, make character designs, theorycraft how your levels are going to look like. Game Design is part of game development as well.\n\nThen you will be able to have a list of features you'd want to have for your game to achieve which will be easier to break down and either look for in tutorials or think on your own. It's easier to solve something small rather than try to write a whole game.\n\nI've started making a game in April 2025 (i'm relatively experienced and a professional game dev). I didn't touch my engine until Late December. Partly due to time constraints but also becuase i was having fun writing down all those and designing and drawing. Game dev is as fun as you want it to be. You don't have to make a game in a month in order to be good. So have fun!",

The dialogs are super intricate (there's a super important dialogue that I reveal in pieces, like the full dialogue is ABCDE, but during the gameplay you'll first hear AC, then later in the game you'll hear AD, then BE etc and you have to put the pieces together, which will gradually explain why the game is happening, and I've had a LOT of fun writing it). The game also has a time loop element to it and it's so beautiful to think and create the timelines, to conceive it so that every version gives the player a specific feeling. And this game is a parenthesis, a focal point that links 2 bigger otherwise unrelated stories (that will each have their own game) and you can play the bigger games without playing this smaller one but you'll be left with unanswered questions. I have a whole universe going on. I also love composing and I sing, and I've created my beautiful characters that I'm so proud of. All that is left, it's putting all of this in UE5 and I hate it",

Organize your work into small steps and in the future as you get familiar with the process you will automatically recognize these steps and arrange them in your head leaving spaces for things that you don't know how to do.\n\nYou will make mistakes and you will most often take a hard way around, then down the line you will figure out that there is a much easier way to do the same thing, this is all part of the process so don't feel the need to do things properly from the beginning, make it work",

I started with very little and after months of learning Godot and Blender I reached this point:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/1nzxtvw/9\\_months\\_learning\\_godot\\_blender\\_and\\_this\\_is\\_what/](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/1nzxtvw/9_months_learning_godot_blender_and_this_is_what/)\n\nIt is also a rough time for gamedevs - a lot of competition and titles on Steam every year so no guarantees it will ever pay off. I treat it as a hobby - I have a stable day job and I am not risking everything on it. But if it pays off... good, learned something and someone paid me to learn stuff. My attitude is - someone fires up Fortnite, I fire up Blender, someone fires up Minecraft, I fire up Godot. Infinitely better to spend time making games than wasting it playing them. I don't even find pleasure in playing games, making them is infinitely more fun for me.\n\nAnd there is a lot to learn. Programming, 3D, art, sound, tools, even editing own damn screenrecordings if you wanna post it on TikTok or YouTube. And then when you think you're done with the development - the marketing nightmare begins (because nobody heard of your game)!!! Good thing is that Steam will take more of an algorithmic approach to the games and push more \"similar content\" to make discovering \"rare gems\" easier so they are at least earning their 30% cut, but even the best algorithm won't help everyone.\n\nIt is not for everyone, but it can be rewarding. After about a year, things that made no sense at the start finally began to click. When I look in the retrospective I can understand how much I've learned so far. You can't see that ahead, only behind.\n\nI'm not trying to discourage you, but to be realistic. Take from this whatever you find useful.",

Some ppl need a softer approach of critique avoiding any negative connotations, a bit more round about. You seem to be of the latter but why presume for someone else?\n\n\nI see someone who's giving themselves plenty of excuses to not move forward and push through to achieve their goals. Playing Video games instead? Complaining there's no next steps? Crying after? Needing the feel goods from other ppl? They are their worse enemy, and blowing this out of proportion emotionally. You want to game Dev, do game Dev. Get off video games. Commit 2-3 hours to it, don't give in to a cheap dopamine fix. Give yourself the 2 options of lying down doing nothing or work on your game. You'll end up working on your game or getting much needed rest. Boredom is a powerful thing if used right. \n\n\nI don't think people are as fragile as you think, not even you. If you never push your limits and are comfortable with complacency, turns out you never find your limits and get better. \n\n\nAnd If a strangers comment would break you, Reddit might not be your environment. Sorry if this offends you. . ",
