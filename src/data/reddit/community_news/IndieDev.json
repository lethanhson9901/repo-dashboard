Basically, you create a model morphing animation in an external software, save each position of the animated vertices into a texture, and then read the texture in the vertex shader to transform the model in-game. By doing this, you can play complex model morphing animations cheaply in the vertex shader.",

If I were on your team, I'd be disappointed seeing this post.

But I got paired with a friend that lived around the block, just me and him. We didn't even have a full team. But somehow, we figured out it would be a good idea to present it as a sock puppet show. We spent weeks making the puppets and the stage and rehearsing. It was very clever and in the end, we killed it! But when it came to standing in front the class as a young freshman who strived to fit in...I faltered. As we got up to do our presentation, I said \"now comes the embarrassing part\" out loud. We do our presentation, absolutely nail it, and get some genuine applause from the audience. And then the teacher gave us her feedback. B+, she would have given us an A+ if I hadn't said what I said in the beginning. I was sooo salty about that moment for so long (I'm sorry for the grade, Mike). A full letter grade, just for my comment? But as an adult, I understand now. Don't denigrate your work because you might be embarrassed of how other people will see it. Be proud that you put forth the effort.",

Or some stuff from cult of lamb; both of those seem to be in the same style of SVG-ish artwork.  But their stuff stands out more to me immediately.\n\nHope it goes well!

If you KNOW the interest is low, why not just price it at 9.99 bucks with 20% off?\n\nNow your game fell flat entirely and because of the way the algorithm works it will never ever pick up again. Such a shame for a great looking game that looks to be made with care and love!\n\nIf you accidentally price your game too low, whats the worst that can happen? You can always raise the price of a successful game.",

XD it's not mind blowing to me after reading the post and these comments, seems pretty in line with the rest of their actions. From the post and comments I've gathered:\n\n● called their own game a flop in their own post about the launch, already setting a precedent for peoples views/opinions of the game\n\n● didn't plug the game in anyway, no pic, link, etc making it incredibly hard for ppl to check out\n\n● chose a generic title for their game making it even harder to find and check out\n\n● didn't announce the games release on the games/company's social media (someone had to repost an old post to bring attention to it)\n\n● didn't listen to constructive feedback about game elements being hard to understand visually (someone mentioned that they told them a while ago the fire elements or something were hard to understand and that they still weren't changed in release)\n\n● and now you mentioning the price being way too high for this kinda quality and level of game/interest etc.\n\nIt's like they did everything possible in the book to make sure their game failed. Everything is screaming sheer incompitence. Atp it doesn't matter if the games good or not, no ones gonna play it and find out. Whoever is managing things over there did a terrible job, and I would be really annoyed if I worked on this game.",

Then, you can tell the difference between small enemies which get more vibrant as a whole as you approach, sooner, and large enemies who get vibrant more \"slowly\" because they are actually further away, (and also as they get close eg their feet will become vibrant before their head which is further away)\n\nAnother way of indicating this that I like, is to have certain enemy characteristics that stay the same size even when the enemy variant is larger - eg they all have the same-sized face and nuts-and-bolts accoutremonts that appear relatively smaller for the comparatively larger variant. However, this requires having encountered the enemy before to become effective.\n\nAlso, don't forget that you can use this illusion of \"I cant tell if that is a normal enemy up close or a titan far away\" can actually be used for practical and deliberate effect - imagine you have them fight a bunch of half-sized enemies, then a you-sized enemy, then you see off in the distance eg what appears to be a regular enemy with a pack of half-pints, but as you walk towards them, they aggro and as they get closer, the fog shifts and suddenly you realize, those arent half-pints, and the guy commanding them is a titan, and you are not prepared for this...\n\n(Minor edit for clarity)",

I would advice taking it all to a more cartoony/realistic style whichever fits better, and I would remove the gradient on the title which would make the inconsistency less prevalent.\n\nThe new banner is so much better by the way, the cat no longer looks like a 3d model and it has so much life, as a fan of puzzle games this looks super interesting!\n\nAs a final opinion, I think you don't need the \"cat\" on the title, as I think it is already pretty self explanatory and it just makes it longer",

Mostly because it is not worth it.\n\nI know what is not worth cleaning up because of experience. Some things that I didn't clean hurt badly later. If I wanted to make the same mistake again, I would have a solid reason to do it.\n\nThese are not rules. Rather good practices. If devs don't use them, it means that they (devs) know what they are doing because of the experience, or they just don't know why they would like to use them because of the lack of experience.\n\nIt is not the latest trend. I'd say that self-documenting code is with us for a long time (like 10-15 years), and it is more trendy nowadays to comment your code because it is much easier to not care about clean code.",

Same in my job.\n\nSelf-documenting code is not only about simple clean-code principles like consistent and intuitive naming convention and short functions/methods. There are more things like domain modelling (and implementing it), design patterns, OOP (or any other paradigm you use), or software architecture in general.\n\nFor example: why would you need such a variable? Looks like a code smell, suggesting that the issue lies somewhere else, and the need for something like this one is just an unfortunate side effect. Now you can comment it (duct tape fix) or redesign your code.\n\nPersonally, I think that in-line comments are ok only if your code is hard to read by design - like complex math or not-human-readable algorithms. In such cases, it should be encapsulated into a black box that you won't touch too often, along with the inline comments.\n\nTop-level documentation, on the other hand, may be useful to introduce new devs. If needed.\n\nSometimes when I worked on team projects, and I had a requirement to document everything, my docs were mostly the same as the methods/functions/classes signatures because there was no need to add more info.",

It stands out better, and more importantly will stand out muuuuch more on the Steam store than the old one because plenty of games have hills, grass, trees, blue sky and clouds in the background. Could have the dice be more visible in it, and have a thicker outline on the logo to make it stand out. I would also suggest making one “Die” in the logo look different from the other (be it colour or incorporating dice colours for one of them) so it makes it more obvious it’s not talking about the same use of the word twice. \n\nOtherwise I really like it and would check the game out if I saw it on Steam :)",

The colours pop without screaming “look at me!”, the dynamic poses look much better and show some real artistic skill. Is it busy? Yes. But I get the feeling that’s intentional to show the feel or energy of the game. And if it’s legible on a fraction of a phone screen it’ll be fine on a handheld pc or TVs/monitors as long as the logo doesn’t blend into the background, which I think either a thicker outline, or better yet, an slightly angular background to it.\n\n… so as you probably noticed, I wrote this out and decided to quickly doodle (on my phone via my finger lol) what changes I’d make. I’d mayyybe make the border around the logo even thicker than this, but I’m not sure, and I’ve added a couple more dice closer to where eyes are naturally drawn to, to make the dice aspect more noticeable.\n\nI’d recommend playing around with any ideas that stood out to you that everyone has suggested though! It’s your art! :)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jpoe2gc9hofg1.jpeg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be77d00bb34ef3c26f490146d3ce29d11494e985",

I mostly don't care when a game says it's unsupported as that means very little. I care quite a lot when a game says it's verified.\n\nOne thing that I always look for is whether or not the game claims to support controller. I've tried playing games that don't and 99% of the time it doesn't end well (and steam even considers these to be playable, which is absurd imo)",

Other Deck users post if (for example) a simple Proton version switch does the trick, and it takes two seconds. Game Properties > Compatibility > Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool. ProtonDB also has a compatibility badge plugin through Decky which is MUCH more accurate than a Steam Deck Verified badge. You’re missing out on the amazing capabilities of the Steam Deck. I’m surprised that as a game dev, you limit yourself to SD verified games only.",

Days by days I see game developers don't know how to make game for gamers (including yours). That's because they're making a copycat instead of solving the problem. If you play Stardew Valley and Expedition 33, both of them save the problem that video game in that genre had (stardew valley solved farming simulator problem, and Expedition 33 solved turn based RPG problem. Meanwhile yours just copycat, like it just \"another Flappy Bird\" clone. But your game is just another Assassin Creed. Your game DOES NOT solve anything stealth game had. Your game is just action game with stealth feature, not a stealth game. There is no hook. That's my 2 cents. Anyway, I play stealth game since '98",

You play as a grounded take on Red Riding Hood, raised by the Huntsman who saved her in an ancient, shared fairytale world that doesn’t care about you.\n\nGameplay-wise, we focus heavily on feel: movement, archery, melee, stealth, and encounters that react to how you approach them rather than forcing one solution (a lot of what my post talks about is us throwing work away to get that right).\n\nStory is character-driven but unfolds slowly through the world rather than big exposition dumps. You’re not saving the world out of the gate, you’re just trying to survive it, and then bigger consequences emerge over time based on how you play.\n\nTargeting release on Steam (PC & Mac, PS5, Xbox, and Switch 2). We’re still in the middle of it, but that’s the honest shape of it.",

I went to college and got a medical degree but I’m currently working a 9-5 that I just don’t enjoy. I REALLY want independence and financial success from my own ideas. I can’t stop thinking about wanting to make my own indie game but I know it will be a bigger undertaking than I realize. I would say my idea is less ambitious than your game because it’s a sidescroller like Limbo and Inside…so that gives me some hope that I CAN pull this dream off. I am self taught in everything I do. I never give up when I try difficult things. My plan is to just do lots of research and make sure I tackle the development in the right order and learn as efficiently as I can while I move forward.

When I say salesmen, they’re great at selling you what they can do for your vision. But, can’t deliver on it. Via my experience, 99% of Reddit is that.\n\nA Steam game published with negative reviews isn’t exactly a dis-qualifying resume. A number of devs have lousy Steam reviews, but have great talent; they just didn’t have a great idea or popular game.\n\nYour experience sounds a lot like mine. I spent a year trying to get a multiplayer game going with “salesmen” devs, only to get examples and demos, but nothing advancing my game. \n\nI luckily/accidentally found a dev who was a 15 year Unity multiplayer dev with a busted early access game who delivered in a week, what the “Salesmen” devs couldn’t do in a year. \n\nIt’s amazing what you can find if you know what to look for. You need recommendations, I can refer some to you.  They do in a week what “salesmen” devs take months. They don’t BS, they deliver. If you are sitting around waiting for progress. Then you are still doing this game dev thing wrong. You either know it or you don’t.",

Most likely the dev was stuck because of your other issues with a lack of direction.  Hindsight is 20/20, and a new dev coming in has a much better foundation to work from than the first one who was prototyping constantly.\n\nMost people hire from AAA talent because they think the finished games on their resume are more of an accomplishment than someone with a long running game.  The reality is most devs in AAA had a small part of the process.  Not saying that’s what you replaced them with, just that it’s a common pitfall and usually what a PM like yourself would react with.\n\nIt’s an interesting read overall, but I think your analysis of the situations shows you still have a lot more to learn.  It’s a good thing you come from money, because it’s going to be an expensive learning experience.  Good luck, and I look forward to reading more in the future to see how you grow as a PM.",

Too many games adjust the monster tactics so heroes can actually fight them - like Witcher and Skyrim where flying monsters land in melee or big monsters come down low. This actually shows the challenge of a fighting a big monster, but provides a mechanic to fight back against the monster. Very cool!",

This makes all but B preferable to me.\n\nSecond, The front of the packaging has hard edges, which are best represented in A and D. The softer right edge of the front plane doesn't make sense visually for me on C.  \n\n\nThird, the vacuum formed packaging around toys is easier to see right next to them since the translucent material is parallel to the camera's view, essentially being a thicker material. The outline on B and D reflects that expectation with the grey outline. The drop shadow on A is also really nice, but I feel like D looks more like packaging at a glance. A would feel a bit like a toy from the 80s or 90s where its free-floating in the packaging, attached with a plastic or wire tie.",
