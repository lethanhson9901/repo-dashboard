So the first boss is a big H for hydrogen and the next boss is a big H with a little curly e tail. And the next is a big L holding a magic rod with an energy ball (the letter \"i\") for Lithium. Each level is named after that element number. You collect all the elements and you'll be able to craft chemicals/alloys to modify your stats (that feature is still a work in progress). \n\nYeah, I have the Kickstarter here: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/starrune/star-rune](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/starrune/star-rune)\n\nAnd you can also join the Discord!

But for the battle zones, you battle against mini-bosses called Glitchborn which cannot be typed. Instead you use the Azki (the letters) to form dash attacks to destroy them. You can also hurt them with a jump/spin slash and a meteor attack, as well as your ultimate (which you cast with \\[enter\\] when you have full charge). \n\nThe funnest part of the game is getting create with the battle zones to see just how fast you can desetroy the mini-bosses. There's all sorts of little micro-decisions and interesting choices to make. Do I use my ultimate? Can I finish him off faster by going here and there and there? should i use the spin slash or dash lines for this part? etc...",

I've put my heart & soul into this for the last 3 years. I keep hearing people say \"focus on aesthetics, don't re-invent the wheel with game mechanics\" but I really wanted to reinvent the wheel I guess lol\n\nThanks again!

It’s brutal to say, but it’s true. This time is usually very short, around 2-3 seconds, which means that your game has to make an impression within that time frame. Therefore, aesthetic is indeed critical.\n\nHowever, a soulless game can be the most beautiful piece of art around, but with “only” aesthetic, it will remain just that: a beautiful, soulless game. I agree that the style could definitely be improved, but when I watched the short clip, I didn’t focus on it. Rather, I focused on the core gameplay idea. To me, this means that your gameplay speaks so loudly that puts other aspects in the background, so to speak. That’s why I stopped to write a comment!",

But I think it was important to not use a lot of pre-made asset packs because they add too much detail which distracted from the letter recognition. And having contrast between the letters and the background is also super important. Because #1 is readability. So I think I found just the right amount of detail (roughly). Still, I think with the right artist, it can go even further haha\n\nAnd yes I do!

The other parts of of the game are mostly linear but in the battlezones, you get to choose which letters to dash to, and it makes for some crazy battles and battles that are really unique to typing, as you have way more options at your fingers than game controllers have; so it gives you this real cool control that is really unlike any other game. \n\nI hope you'll check out the kickstarter and/or join the discord!! :D",

I changed it to something else... the name slips my mind right now lol.. it started out as an asteroids tutorial project that I added typing game mechanics to. Then I changed the asteroids ship to a star by drawing a couple extra lines, and then I settled on Star Rune for the name.\n\nI was very tempted to make a typing pun and include words that were good for SEO like \"Typing\" or \"Keyboard\" or \"Keys\" etc... but that felt a little soulless (and way too cliche) to me.\n\nBut Runes are glyphs / symbols. And since the enemies are glyphs / symbols and it's a typing game, I thought it was a cool combo. It also hints at magic and fantasy elements, which I like.\n\nStar Rune might be a simple name, but so is Dragon Ball. Or Star Wars. Or Star Fox... etc...\n\nBut I'm open to appending something onto it.. like how Zelda is \"The Legend of Zelda\" not just Zelda.. and now it's like \"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom\".\n\nI could do something like that... \"The Legend of Star Rune : The Last Star\" or something haha.\n\nWhat do you think?",

I've actually have been designing a lot of the game based on how fun it will be to commentate on like a sports commentator during gameplay / a big tournament or competition. \n\nThe game has sections where it's just pure typing speed. But there are other parts where there are little micro-choices. The best example is during the combat system in battle zones, where you get to choose which letters you want to dash to. Using a letter too early might slow you down because you can only use each letter once; new letters will spawn in but you have to wait a little bit for them to spawn back in. There are many decisions like \"Will I use my ultimate attack here or will i save it for the next battle\". Or do i want to try to finish this mini boss off by spin slashing him or should i dash to that  letter over there? etc...\n\nThose little tiny decisions are what make it fun and will make it especially fun to commentate on in a competitive environment.

Maybe it is a reasonable price, but for me personally, I wouldn't pay up to 29 for a typing game since you just type. Since it's on Kickstarter, the price is likely to change and doesn't reflect the main price, and for a high-quality game such as this, I'd pay mostly 15–20 USD. That's like, for the Steam full release, I mean. That's just my personal opinion, as a person that plays a large variety of games, not mainly typing games. I take a look at another game, like idk Arc Raiders, and if I save a little more, I could just buy that. But as I said, just my personal opinion! I do hope your game ends up succeeding, as it looks very fun.",

That's your golden standard for 'moneys worth'.\n\nSo, if you pay 6 bucks and it lasted you an hour, you've had your moneys worth. No refund. You pay 12 bucks and you played it 2 hours, No refund. You paid 18 bucks and find it not to your taste after 2 hours? Refund.

If its short and fun people will play it 10x more time.\n\nThe only problem i see here is your game is story-based which is harder to make and easier to skip. On the other hand, story is also the one that can keep your content longer for the players especially if they read.\n\nIts not that bad, overall. I mostly used refund becauss I though my PC can run the game but not or the game is so badly optimize I cannot get in the flow state to even play over 2 hours.",

If you've ever been asked by discord if you're 18+, that's what will change to an ID check. I'd wager most people have never seen that before. \n\n\nDiscord has had a major child porn issue for a bit now. And a lot of children access porn via discord as well.

I love the visual style that is a combination of realism but with warm stylised colours.\n\nThe only thing is that the red dress at 0:06 looks untextured before the floral pattern gets applied and cloth physics kick in. I imagine the material is correct for the fabric it is meant to represent but the lighting isn't realistic so the material looks flat. The stack of finished dresses on the other hand makes me want to bury my face in them.\n\nIf I wanted to start a family and live on a farm with wildflowers and play a job simulator in the off hours, this would be the one. I'm not, so I won't buy the game, but you absolutely need to blast this at every cosy/job simulator streamer. We live in an age where the most likely path to success is making a meme game and hoping it goes viral, but surely there are still many people who just want to play a good game in a familiar genre?",

Reach out to a lot of non-traditional channels and consider places that people who love fashion might be. Advertise in fashion magazines. In cosplay howto magazines. Find forums of people who love dress-up. You might want to hire someone whose job it is to find and engage with these people.\n\nPotentially you could reach out to people with their own fashion following and ask for their advice on where to find similar people. \n\nExtra content could be related to demographics of fashion, such as running a cosplay store, or working behind the scenes on runway shows.\n\nGood luck!",

Just make sure to read the sidebar rules as I think devs can only post promo posts once a week or something like that.\n\nI'll be honest though: even if it's a game that people would be all over, Early Access has an incredibly bad rep in the cozy gaming community. People have been burnt over by too many \"abandoned\" projects, etc. So that might also explain the lacklustre sales despite the obvious quality of the game. (And the fact that you can throw rolls of fabric to people's head which, having worked in retail, I relate to a lot). \n\nI would definitely continue on improving the game and try to launch a very solid, bug-free, content-full Full Release and have a big push of marketing around that.",

I asked if they could share the artist, which they did, and when I saw her portfolio... it made me go like \"IT'S THIS ONE\".\n\nSuper happy with my choice and it was a pleasure to work with my artist.\n\nSo, my advice is, take your time to pick one that you believe can bring your imagination to life. Definitely do not rush things and take your time to give constructive feedback on things you really want your artist to understand/see.\n\nHope this helps. Best of luck!",

When she sent me the first sketch of the whole thing, I immediately told her to keep that dog design. \n\nRegarding the player character, it took quite a bit of time to get it to feel right. I was gonna post here some progress sketches last night but forgot. \n\nBasically, I sent her the sprite of my character, and I did 2 or 3 sketches of how I would want the player to look like close-up, and in what pose I wanted it. \n\nHere's the first few sketches my artist sent me:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/MWl20bt\n\nI then proceeded to give some feedback on many details, I did more sketches of little changes I wanted done, then she delivered more updated sketches, then I gave more feedback, then more sketches, and then we reached the sketch that I decided was final:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/BKEVjFL\n\nAfter that, it was linework, colour, shading, highlighs and other details and done.\n\nHope this answers your question!",

I didn't have any plans for the game, I was programming and drawing stuff. Then one day I realized I wanted to do something in honor of my dog, and the game became about him. \n\nIn the game, you just have to collect wishbones that will grant you a heartfelt but selfish wish in the end. Since the game can be completed in 15 to 30 minutes, I might just release it for free.",

There's more recommendation going around that your keyart should better reflect the actual look and feel of your title. Take RoadWarden as an example, it's got some beautiful keyart, AND it reflects the style of the game in a way that's more authentic to what you'll actually experience as a player. \n\nUltimately the choice is yours, and it is *really* beautiful art, but just the sentiment I've taken notice of recently.",

Making small projects in an array of different genres because you never know when a company might segue to that, but to put what you were most passionate about in the beginning of your portfolio to emphasize the quality of the work you produce when working in genres you were most in love with. But then showing other genres towards the end to show you have the ability to be adaptable. \n\nAlso small slices, not full big games but something similar to what we see now in game jams or demos to show a basic mechanical understanding of an engaging enough gameplay loop. And with that passion and demonstration of technical understanding, its a good way to get an in and then work your way in the system towards areas you would be most comfortable in, specially on the art side of things as well.",

Post on social media often. Have a Discord where you announce updates, show sneak peeks, and more. Also, Reddit is a good place to post because you can actually talk with the community. More on that later.\n\n3. Talk to the community. Like I said before, you can get feedback and stuff from your social medias(Reddit and Discord in this case), so you know what your players want and how to attract more players and stuff. You can also convince new people to play your game by showing that gameplay footage.\n\nI am by no means a professional, but these tricks have worked for other people that I've seen so try these if you haven't already.

Which makes sense, but so often I see the opposite advice in all these genres where flashy visuals can draw in a crowd.\n\nBut yeah, nice to hear my plan isn't a death sentence. Thanks!\n\nOh, and congrats on your general success!",

Most of the time I just keep to myself. But sometimes I’ll try to join a conversation normally and it always goes bad.\n\nFor example, I heard someone talking about Fallout 76, so I said “Hey Mark, do you play Fallout 76?” and people immediately started laughing at me and making fun of me.\n\nAnother time my ex-friend came over to my house and spent like 20 minutes straight making fun of my PS5, my PC, and all my “nerdy stuff.” He kept saying it was childish and that I’ll never make anything out of it.\n\nIt honestly makes me feel like crap. I’m not trying to be weird or annoying, I just like games and coding. I even make my own games, but people at school act like that’s a joke.\n\nI know I’m only 14 and maybe I won’t make it, but I don’t think liking this stuff means I deserve to be bullied for it.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this? What do you do when people won’t stop making fun of what you like?\n\nI know it’s not the best place to post it,I’m sorry",

          "text": "In high school people try to make fun of literally everything. You have to understand that they are making fun of you is NOTHING to do with you, it is all about them. If it wasn't you, they would make fun of something or someone else, because it is the only way to be accepted or loved in their minds. They probably have traumas from their relationships with their parents, they don't feel loved or confident etc. So remember, it is not happening because of you, it is happening because of their weaknesses.\n\nTry to be the best version of yourself. Just try to ignore them for a few years, as long as it doesn't turn to physical. If it becomes physical immediately talk to your parents, teachers etc. Also if there is a time it becomes very hard to deal with psychologically talk to an adult whom you trust.\n\nTo let you know, you will probably succeed in the life. Learning to code this early and making games will put you ahead of a lot of competition in professional life. Most of the people can't decide what to do with their lives until they finish college. So do what you love right now. Create games. If you release a game every year, you will have 3 games released when you graduated from high school. Also you can try to find people who you can create or play games with. Who are into things that you are into. That way you wouldn't have to deal with loneliness.\n\nI wish the best for you. You seem like a brilliant young person. You are doing good. Trust yourself.\n\nEdit: Also, you can learn martial arts. I suggest bjj or mma. Maybe this advice seem weird to you but I think people who likes games would definitelly like martial arts, especially bjj. It is also going to boost your confidence, make you a healthier person. Plus, you will learn to defend yourself, also you can meet nice people there. I suggest you to just try a few lessons to see if you like it or not.",

People would laugh when i said something like. “Hey this band ‘x’ is cool, you should check them out”, or when i talked about computers. Flash forward, im 34 now and have toured the world as a guitarist, made music for some video games, and really… those people who judged me back then and laughed at me, are absolutely nowhere in life. Never had careers, never really found their identity. \n\nMy advice is to play the long game. And stay true to your quirks and interests. People will love them later on. It might be hard now, but these people are out of your life soon.",

But with my experience with people that like to bully and as my very short experience as one myself (as a child, on grade school), I can think of some very general, little advice (Even though you didn't ask for one xD). \n\n\nAs an adult, I realized some things that helped me to not get bullied in my school life:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNever, ever share any information about your personal life, your hobbies, or your dreams. People that like to bully are always paying attention for personal details to bully you with later. I personally don't understand that behavior, but there are a lot of people that do that. And usually people don't care about other people's hobbies, anyways (unless they're interested in you, of course). \n\n\nSo I guess that you should only talk about those things with close friends that share the same hobbies. Someone that barely knows what chess is wouldn't understand why other person would be really passionate about chess anyways. It would look like a waste of time to them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, please, don't give them any reaction that makes you look like a victim. \n\n\nWrote like that, it sounds kind of stupid. But I mean something like: if they hurt your feelings, do not show it. Or at least not immediately. Or do not tell them they are doing something wrong, or that they're mistaken. \nBut don't let yourself be bullied either. \n\n\n\n\nBetter take it a way like 'to each their hobbies. I like this. You don't. It's normal if you think it's stupid'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, looking \"tough\" seems to help.\n\n\nI used to change schools like each year or every 2 years. And people used to think I was some kind of though guy that partied and even did drugs, for some reason. Just because of my looks. Even though I was a nerd that loved videogames and comics. \n\n\nAnd when I went to live to other country and went to school there, I got asked once if I was a cartel goon back in my country, because I \"looked like it\". Or got asked if I had military experience in other ocassion, because apparently \"it was obvious\". Me! A nerdy teenager! What kind of cartel or guerrilla recruits children to then let them go anyway? Haha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, I guess that looks and not sharing personal information usually help not getting bullied.",

You have an internal world, wants and dreams and that’s a good foundation for building character. \n\nVideo games is a viable career, and not some pipe dream, so keep at it, pursue higher education and you’ll do great! \n\nTeenagers can be cruel, but there really isn’t much you can do. Try not to take it personally, laugh it off and grow some thick skin because there will always be jerks around and it’s important to learn how to navigate such an environment.\n\nGood luck little dev ✌️",

But it was good in a way because it brought gamers closer together. You need some friends into games. Games are the coolest thing in the world, and you're not alone in your interests. You're just surrounded by the wrong people, and that sucks, because anyone creating anything, who has a passion for that thing, should be encouraged. High school is a weird time, and there are a lot of bullies who judge others because they have already made incorrect assumptions about the things they don't understand.\n\nHopefully you find some like-minded people. Please ignore the bullies, because they're going to end up working jobs that make them miserable while you'll likely end up doing something you want to do, due to discovering a passion early.\n\nSource: I was obsessed with games from a very early age, worked several jobs that made me miserable, but eventually got a job in the games industry, and it makes me happy, especially with the awareness of how bad other jobs can be. It's very rare to enjoy your job. I love getting to work on things I like, and the earlier you start practicing, the better your chances are of achieving that. Keep making games.",

I collected the daily strips, and was madness maddened by them. Friends criticized. Friends made fun. I tore up the Buck Rogers strips. For a month I walked through my fourth-grade classes, stunned and empty. One day I burst into tears, wondering what devastation had happened to me. The answer was: Buck Rogers. He was gone, and life simply wasn’t worth living. The next thought was: Those are not my friends, the ones who got me to tear the strips apart and so tear my own life down the middle; they are my enemies. I went back to collecting Buck Rogers. My life has been happy ever since. For that was the beginning of my writing science fiction. Since then, I have never listened to anyone who criticized my taste in space travel, sideshows or gorillas. When this occurs, I pack up my dinosaurs and leave the room. For, you see, it is all mulch.

          "text": "\"He kept saying it was childish and that I’ll never make anything out of it.\"\n\nDon’t worry, kid. When I started making games at 18, my first salary was higher than that of most parents of people my age, not to mention them (yep, a poor country and an even poorer city). Anyway, it was never for the sake of money.\n\nGame development is something you stay with for the sake of the industry you deeply love. And even if you don’t end up as a developer, games are a cool, unique medium, which will affect your development no worse than any books or films. At your age, I guess I had barely read 2–5 books, but had played a whole bunch of games, and by other people’s evaluation, I was very smart.\n\nAnd is VERY useful to learn to code. Anybody who makes fun of you for getting skills you can earn money with while they are just burning their precious time is acting, at least, unwisely.\n\n\n\n\"Has anyone else dealt with this? What do you do when people won’t stop making fun of what you like?\"\n\nI guess bullies don’t actually work this way. They are not bullying your interests, but you. For whatever reasons, they enjoy your reaction, passivity, or vulnerability, and they feel safe doing this. I think aggressiveness is part of human behavior, and people handle it differently.\n\nI was almost never bullied because I was twice as big as most people my age. And even if someone tried to bully me, I mostly didn’t care much or was defended, because I was confident and social.\n\nStill, there were moments when other people threatened my safety, and this is very serious. If you are writing in English, I guess you don’t need to worry much about that, and if something like this does happen to you, the system should protect you. You can inform parents, police, etc., and you will be immediately defended.\n\n\n\nBut regarding your bullies nowadays, I guess it is as simple as this: you can try changing your behavior or social status in the current system, or snitch on them. If those variants don’t seem like a resolution for you, try to ignore them until you go your separate ways.\n\nNo doubt that your identity, your emotional stability, skills, and all of these things are much more important than any of those bullies and the fleeting relationships with kids who will be barely remembered by you very soon.\n\nYou will definitely find people who will be your friends and share similar interests soon anyway.\n\nThere is a whole bunch of commenters, including me, who are already happy to support you. Be sure, there are even more such people out there.",
