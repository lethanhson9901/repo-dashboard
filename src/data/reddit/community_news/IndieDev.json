So the first boss is a big H for hydrogen and the next boss is a big H with a little curly e tail. And the next is a big L holding a magic rod with an energy ball (the letter \"i\") for Lithium. Each level is named after that element number. You collect all the elements and you'll be able to craft chemicals/alloys to modify your stats (that feature is still a work in progress). \n\nYeah, I have the Kickstarter here: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/starrune/star-rune](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/starrune/star-rune)\n\nAnd you can also join the Discord!

The game can mostly be thought of as 2 parts: \"paths\" and \"battlezones\". For the paths, it's mostly all linear; just like a typing test. But for the battle zones, you battle against mini-bosses called Glitchborn which cannot be typed. Instead you use the Azki (the letters) to form dash attacks to destroy them. You can also hurt them with a jump/spin slash and a meteor attack, as well as your ultimate (which you cast with \\[enter\\] when you have full charge). \n\nThe funnest part of the game is getting create with the battle zones to see just how fast you can desetroy the mini-bosses. There's all sorts of little micro-decisions and interesting choices to make. Do I use my ultimate? Can I finish him off faster by going here and there and there? should i use the spin slash or dash lines for this part? etc...",

It’s brutal to say, but it’s true. This time is usually very short, around 2-3 seconds, which means that your game has to make an impression within that time frame. Therefore, aesthetic is indeed critical.\n\nHowever, a soulless game can be the most beautiful piece of art around, but with “only” aesthetic, it will remain just that: a beautiful, soulless game. I agree that the style could definitely be improved, but when I watched the short clip, I didn’t focus on it. Rather, I focused on the core gameplay idea. To me, this means that your gameplay speaks so loudly that puts other aspects in the background, so to speak. That’s why I stopped to write a comment!",

But I think it was important to not use a lot of pre-made asset packs because they add too much detail which distracted from the letter recognition. And having contrast between the letters and the background is also super important. Because #1 is readability. So I think I found just the right amount of detail (roughly). Still, I think with the right artist, it can go even further haha\n\nAnd yes I do!

The other parts of of the game are mostly linear but in the battlezones, you get to choose which letters to dash to, and it makes for some crazy battles and battles that are really unique to typing, as you have way more options at your fingers than game controllers have; so it gives you this real cool control that is really unlike any other game. \n\nI hope you'll check out the kickstarter and/or join the discord!! :D",

I changed it to something else... the name slips my mind right now lol.. it started out as an asteroids tutorial project that I added typing game mechanics to. Then I changed the asteroids ship to a star by drawing a couple extra lines, and then I settled on Star Rune for the name.\n\nI was very tempted to make a typing pun and include words that were good for SEO like \"Typing\" or \"Keyboard\" or \"Keys\" etc... but that felt a little soulless (and way too cliche) to me.\n\nBut Runes are glyphs / symbols. And since the enemies are glyphs / symbols and it's a typing game, I thought it was a cool combo. It also hints at magic and fantasy elements, which I like.\n\nStar Rune might be a simple name, but so is Dragon Ball. Or Star Wars. Or Star Fox... etc...\n\nBut I'm open to appending something onto it.. like how Zelda is \"The Legend of Zelda\" not just Zelda.. and now it's like \"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom\".\n\nI could do something like that... \"The Legend of Star Rune : The Last Star\" or something haha.\n\nWhat do you think?",

There will also be power ups you can pick up but you will lose if you type an error (the power ups are a feature I'm still working on). \n\nI hope that answers the question. Let me know! :D",

This simple yet brilliant idea made me cry for a few seconds.\n\nA bit of context to explain that feeling better:\nI’m a senior software developer, and I wanted to try some 3D programming. I started three months ago with the Unity Learning Path, and I literally devoured those tutorials as if I had always known how to use the engine. I was extremely happy and felt certain that I would create something cool in my free time.\nSince then, other aspects of my life have been getting harder day by day (relationships, health, money, etc.), and I quickly lost motivation. I realized that I can’t control bad times, but I can keep my mind away from negative thoughts by continuing to improve my personal skills to avoid depression.\nI wanted to find an idea that could bring me back to the old days, when everything was good and problems didn’t exist in my life. I wanted, somehow, to go back to my childhood, but I found nothing....only darkness, like my thoughts. And then your post appeared… and yes, that’s exactly what I was looking for. This really brought me back to my childhood!\nThis somehow turned on the lights again in my mind, and that alone is a W.\n\nThank you for this, with all my heart ❤️",

You paid 18 bucks and find it not to your taste after 2 hours? Refund.

They aren't the only games that do this. \n\nThe argument (that I agree with) is that these games probably should have released a while ago but when that occurs community financial support will stop, so it's in a perpetual state of development.\n\nBut pirate software is a narcissist, not a pedophile. Unless I've missed something I'm not very online these days. His name shouldn't really be brought up in the same paragraph as yandere devs gross personal life.",

Post on social media often. Have a Discord where you announce updates, show sneak peeks, and more. Also, Reddit is a good place to post because you can actually talk with the community. More on that later.\n\n3. Talk to the community. Like I said before, you can get feedback and stuff from your social medias(Reddit and Discord in this case), so you know what your players want and how to attract more players and stuff. You can also convince new people to play your game by showing that gameplay footage.\n\nI am by no means a professional, but these tricks have worked for other people that I've seen so try these if you haven't already.

Making small projects in an array of different genres because you never know when a company might segue to that, but to put what you were most passionate about in the beginning of your portfolio to emphasize the quality of the work you produce when working in genres you were most in love with. But then showing other genres towards the end to show you have the ability to be adaptable. \n\nAlso small slices, not full big games but something similar to what we see now in game jams or demos to show a basic mechanical understanding of an engaging enough gameplay loop. And with that passion and demonstration of technical understanding, its a good way to get an in and then work your way in the system towards areas you would be most comfortable in, specially on the art side of things as well.",

Reach out to a lot of non-traditional channels and consider places that people who love fashion might be. Advertise in fashion magazines. In cosplay howto magazines. Find forums of people who love dress-up. You might want to hire someone whose job it is to find and engage with these people.\n\nPotentially you could reach out to people with their own fashion following and ask for their advice on where to find similar people. \n\nExtra content could be related to demographics of fashion, such as running a cosplay store, or working behind the scenes on runway shows.\n\nGood luck!",

They look pretty symmetrical to me given the skewed perspective, especially within reason that a human drew this.\n\n>group of 3 farm factory things look identical\n\nAgain from the first text point discussed, making identical things in a picture is something that AI is notoriously bad at doing, whereas when you have multiple elements like that, a human is so much more likely to just copy and paste instead of making inconsistent variants that don't match in details.",

Maybe the old one was the one you actually were originally using, but the new one is also AI generated but I guess visually more appealing...\n\nSo you put that together and posted here. Then to drive up the engagement, you've been responding with \"Okay!\" and \"Ok I see\", nonsense filler replies to a lot of people's genuine comments, because you're under the false impression that by doing this, you're driving up engagement on your post and therefore it will perform better for the algorithm or something.\n\nI have some bad news for you (and good news for honest game devs), this is not going to work. Your game is not going to become successful because you use lazy methods of engagement farming to up the numbers on your posts. All you've done is created a mildly \"successful\" reddit post. Which means absolutely nothing for your game sales.\n\nIf I were you, I'd spend less time on engagement farming for upvotes and comment counts, and more time polishing your game and improving the art style. Because the characters in your actual gameplay footage look nothing like either of the characters in your AI generated capsule art images.\n\nFor some reason they are just incredibly generic placeholder characters, and then your actual character has a robot arm?\n\nYou're doing game dev all wrong. It's like you're trying to pump out an asset flip, then prop it up solely on engagement bait social media posts, hoping that somehow all of that will generate lots of sales and you'll be a successful indie dev without actually making a good game.",

The point of the capsule has always been to sell a concept/genre + a feeling, not to show the game. That's what the screenshots are for, and they show up when you hover.\n\nWhat can happen sometimes is that the capsule seems to sell the wrong feeling or is just too much of a mismatch stylistically.\n\nCompositionally, the new one is absolutely better, and it does look a lot more polished and professional, but the style is so devoid of texture that it looks \"bland\" or generic, something common in art that's \"too clean\" or made with AI (not saying it is AI). I think that's why comments say they miss the charm of the first one. However, that doesn't mean the solution is to use the old one as is. A new capsule in a different style or even a touch-up on this capsule will usually still look better.\n\nUsing in-game art without enough editing or *some* artistic knowledge usually ends up looking unpolished and as a result gives the impression that THE GAME is not polished, even though it very well could be!\n\nCharm is good, but you do NOT want your Steam page to look \"amateurish\" regardless of if you are Indie or not. Your capsule is supposed to be the best version of the game, not the one with most fidelity.",

The artists that AI steals from the most and thus have a similar style also have high skill (and often pricetag) to back it up, so they usually don't make janky mistakes or general inconsistencies.\n\nIt's also good to remember that some people's art can look \"more AI\" because AI IS trained on stolen human -- the same way using an em-dash doesn't immediately mean someone is a bot. People were doing these things before. Usually people can still see the soul in something, and as long as something isn't actually AI AND looks decent, most people won't mind it.

It is the reason I despise AI generated imagery to begin with, and it is *glowing* here.\n\nCompare with your screenshot, only the over-the-shoulder belt has a buckle, while the horizontal does not (I'd even assume it's just a waistband, not a leather belt). Now look closer at the belts themselves, look at the *holes*: they are absolutely not uniform in any way that would be reasonable even for a beginner artist, let alone someone demanding that kind of money. The bottom belt has two holes squeezed into the tail, the top belt has  just one. The top belt has four holes setting up a pattern, and there *should* be a fifth hole on the shoulder before it flips out of sight, and because there's a hole on the other end of the vertical belt, there's no \"there are only 4 holes and then it stops\" excuse (unless you think that it's a weird belt that has only 4 holes and then a random hole near the end?). \n\nLastly, I want to draw your attention to the eye shine. The irises are the correct shape, but the shines in each of the eyes are very different (left eye shine is entirely contained inside the iris, right eye shine is 50% inside 50% outside; each of those are correct choices in their respective rights, but I don't think I've ever seen anyone mix them). You can only see it by really zooming in.\n\nTl;dr what I'm saying is, a stranger on the internet is 100% convinced you've been ripped off.",

The details you pointed out are really quite minor mistakes, small circles that are misaligned slightly? That's the kind of error I could make as an artist. When AI messes up a pattern, it's a lot more obvious because it looks like it tries to do something completely different in the middle of a pattern because it doesn't actually understand them. I would recommend checking out his fiver page and see how consistent the art style is, and then maybe wander over to r/isthisai or something and check out some AI generated examples, zoom in on the details the same way you did here. Let me know if you still think it looks similar.",

The cards were rotated towards the viewer and spread out in an easy to read manner. In the final image the hand placement is almost lost at the top of the composition, harder to read and competing in interest with all the red elements.\n\nIf this is a card's game the capsule should make it obvious. If it were me, I'd rotate the king's arm so the hand stays around the negative space below the K (of the King's title). Also I'd make the cards bigger and spread out like they were in your sketch.

I didn't have any plans for the game, I was programming and drawing stuff. Then one day I realized I wanted to do something in honor of my dog, and the game became about him. \n\nIn the game, you just have to collect wishbones that will grant you a heartfelt but selfish wish in the end.

I asked if they could share the artist, which they did, and when I saw her portfolio... it made me go like \"IT'S THIS ONE\". \n\nSuper happy with my choice and it was a pleasure to work with my artist.\n\nSo, my advice is, take your time to pick one that you believe can bring your imagination to life. Definitely do not rush things and take your time to give constructive feedback on things you really want your artist to understand/see.\n\nHope this helps. Best of luck!",

There's more recommendation going around that your keyart should better reflect the actual look and feel of your title. Take RoadWarden as an example, it's got some beautiful keyart, AND it reflects the style of the game in a way that's more authentic to what you'll actually experience as a player. \n\nUltimately the choice is yours, and it is *really* beautiful art, but just the sentiment I've taken notice of recently.",

The visuals are just stunning, and the intro and everything is very mysterious so great job! It seems your goals are being met. What made me very happy was the local multiplayer mode. I am a huge fan of multiplayer games (I have 5 brothers and 3 sisters, and we often play games together). The audio is great and hitting things is very juicy.\n\nOne note I had was with the splash screen. I've been told that sometimes the Unity splash screen gives people a bad impression because so many trash games were made with it. This might be outdated information but maybe look into that and consider slightly changing it up a bit? Don't get me wrong I love Unity but that's just what I've been told.",
