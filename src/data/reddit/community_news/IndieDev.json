If you've ever been asked by discord if you're 18+, that's what will change to an ID check. I'd wager most people have never seen that before. \n\n\nDiscord has had a major child porn issue for a bit now. And a lot of children access porn via discord as well. Not to mention a lot of countries are starting to require ID checks for adult content. So it's a two birds one stone thing for them. \n\n\nGranted AI ID checks are hardly useful but legally they come out ahead. ",

Most people here are developing and hoping to convince people, doing it all over again to join beyond a \"hey there\" post is not just \"calling it a day\".\n\nIt is hard enough to keep people checking steam community, good luck convincing people to download an app or just remember a website exist on their browser when they can just sign up for a facebook group, a subreddit or in this case, a discord server.\n\nDon't get me wrong, discord is terrible because all your threads are essentially dark web for no reason.

[Itch.io](http://Itch.io), alongside other sites (gog, steam), would give you a larger reach, and with the recent Discord news, it may no longer be the ideal place to have your community exclusively. Your game looks amazing; a lot of effort and heart went into its production. However, securing your community on multiple platforms would make it more accessible and ensure the game's survival isn't contingent on one site, multiple sites gives you more reach and is friendly for the growing anti-discord crowd. This might require more work on your part, but the work you've already done is amazing, and I'd personally hate to see it go if Discord goes the way of Skype.",

A few things that stick out to me:\n- something about the player character’s design feels off and out of place. Almost like they don’t match the rest of the world.\n- it looks like everything can be destroyed in a single hit. It makes everything feel like it’s made of paper. Ideally, different materials take a different amount of hits to break. The best example is when they attack the frog leaning against the wall. The wall gets destroyed as well.\n- it looks like xplosions are meant as the primary way to mine. Ideally there is still some kind of manual/melee way to do this for folks that are trying to terraform specific shapes.\n- sometimes it feels like the character is larger than there supposed to be or other elements are designed too small. For example, they are about half as tall as most trees and the explosions don’t seem very impressive because they’re just big enough for the character to fit through. It makes the character feel like a giant but also makes the enemies, creatures, explosions, and the general environment feel less impactful. For example the giant buff frog guy would look more intimidating if they were larger or the player was smaller.\n- in your video, you briefly show first person mode. This looks far more immersive compared to the rest of the video. I think because it solves some of the character problems I mentioned prior. Everything looks bigger in first person.",

          "text": "This looks amazing. As a handheld gamer (Steam Deck and Switch 2) I worry that this kind of thing might be out of my reach right now. But I’m hoping. For my money, this is what Minecraft _should_ look like in 2026. \n\nThe potential for voxel based games seems extraordinary to me. I’ve played games since the 8bit days and I remember feeling the sense of limitation when moving around early 3D environments and having them not react the way they should when hit with bombs or smashed by moving vehicles. How flat texture bullet holes would fade after a few moments. It felt like a shame not to be able to properly interact. \n\nMore recently having played games like Teardown and Donkey Kong Bananza it seems like we’re poised for a whole new level of environmental interactivity. The mind boggles at what we might see. I’m imagining, being a big Nintendo nerd, an open air Zelda where you can reshape the environment to cause mudslides and floods, direct lava to burn down enemy fortresses or melt a glacier to gain access to a dungeon. All done with real physics. It would be wild.\n\nThere are entire games you could build just using voxel based environments and directing water flows. If anyone remembers the fantastic Blast Corp from Rare back in the waaaaay back olden days, imagine that kind of gameplay with a fully realistic destructible world? \n\nI’m also thinking kaiju games with fully voxel based cities and landscapes that get destroyed in real time and different terrain responds differently to your physical or elemental attacks.\n\nAll told this feels like a new frontier. A step away from the polygon based perfection we’re now approaching into a new way of building 3D worlds that, as hardware improves, will become the new standard.",

I love the visual style that is a combination of realism but with warm stylised colours.\n\nThe only thing is that the red dress at 0:06 looks untextured before the floral pattern gets applied and cloth physics kick in. I imagine the material is correct for the fabric it is meant to represent but the lighting isn't realistic so the material looks flat. The stack of finished dresses on the other hand makes me want to bury my face in them.\n\nIf I wanted to start a family and live on a farm with wildflowers and play a job simulator in the off hours, this would be the one. I'm not, so I won't buy the game, but you absolutely need to blast this at every cosy/job simulator streamer. We live in an age where the most likely path to success is making a meme game and hoping it goes viral, but surely there are still many people who just want to play a good game in a familiar genre?",

Even a way to share the blueprints for the clothes online would organically create a community that shares their designs and grows by itself.",

It will take a while for you to find your specific market (those who love fashion) but you might have a huge hit on your hands.\n\nI'd keep on iterating on this but also iterate on your marketing. Reach out to a lot of non-traditional channels and consider places that people who love fashion might be. Advertise in fashion magazines. In cosplay howto magazines. Find forums of people who love dress-up. You might want to hire someone whose job it is to find and engage with these people.\n\nPotentially you could reach out to people with their own fashion following and ask for their advice on where to find similar people. \n\nExtra content could be related to demographics of fashion, such as running a cosplay store, or working behind the scenes on runway shows.\n\nGood luck!",

People have been burnt over by too many \"abandoned\" projects, etc. So that might also explain the lacklustre sales despite the obvious quality of the game. (And the fact that you can throw rolls of fabric to people's head which, having worked in retail, I relate to a lot). \n\nI would definitely continue on improving the game and try to launch a very solid, bug-free, content-full Full Release and have a big push of marketing around that.",

I ended up getting a bunch of private messages of some bots and scammers (I remember 2 different \"people\" sent me the exact same portfolio).\n\nIt got overwhelming looking at so many portfolios and not finding one that made me go like \"IT'S THIS ONE\".\n\nThen one I saw someone post something about their game and saw their capsule image was very very cute and it had the vibes/style I was looking for. I asked if they could share the artist, which they did, and when I saw her portfolio... it made me go like \"IT'S THIS ONE\".\n\nSuper happy with my choice and it was a pleasure to work with my artist.\n\nSo, my advice is, take your time to pick one that you believe can bring your imagination to life. Definitely do not rush things and take your time to give constructive feedback on things you really want your artist to understand/see.\n\nHope this helps. Best of luck!",

When she sent me the first sketch of the whole thing, I immediately told her to keep that dog design. \n\nRegarding the player character, it took quite a bit of time to get it to feel right. I was gonna post here some progress sketches last night but forgot. \n\nBasically, I sent her the sprite of my character, and I did 2 or 3 sketches of how I would want the player to look like close-up, and in what pose I wanted it. \n\nHere's the first few sketches my artist sent me:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/MWl20bt\n\nI then proceeded to give some feedback on many details, I did more sketches of little changes I wanted done, then she delivered more updated sketches, then I gave more feedback, then more sketches, and then we reached the sketch that I decided was final:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/BKEVjFL\n\nAfter that, it was linework, colour, shading, highlighs and other details and done.\n\nHope this answers your question!",

I know people are tired of this type of stuff, but this game was born from the pain of losing my real life dog to poison 2 years ago. \n\nI was working on a different project before, but I couldn't put my mind to focus on it, so I started a new project with the main goal of keeping my head busy. I didn't have any plans for the game, I was programming and drawing stuff. Then one day I realized I wanted to do something in honor of my dog, and the game became about him. \n\nIn the game, you just have to collect wishbones that will grant you a heartfelt but selfish wish in the end. Since the game can be completed in 15 to 30 minutes, I might just release it for free.",

There's more recommendation going around that your keyart should better reflect the actual look and feel of your title. Take RoadWarden as an example, it's got some beautiful keyart, AND it reflects the style of the game in a way that's more authentic to what you'll actually experience as a player. \n\nUltimately the choice is yours, and it is *really* beautiful art, but just the sentiment I've taken notice of recently.",

But when they say “yes, yes” and then take eight months to fix a translation error (which was annoying, because the effect didn't match what was written), or when they release DLC featuring their characters at the beach while the base game (a Fire Emblem-like game) is full of bugs... That's when I feel like I'm wasting my time and they deserve a bad rating.\n\nNow, as a developer, I'm lucky to have players who take the time to report bugs when they encounter them. Why? Probably because they encounter bugs after several hours of play. Not right from the start, nor all the time. And it makes a big difference between encountering a bug (major or minor) after enjoying the game or right from the start and in abundance.\n\nSure, there are players who go overboard, like everywhere else.

          "text": "I think this is a blurrier line than people admit. Even large studios with full QA teams and significant budgets still ship games with bugs. So expecting indie developers - who often don’t have dedicated testers - to release perfectly polished games feels unrealistic. That said, I do think we’re seeing this problem more often than we should.\n\nBugs absolutely matter. Players paid for the game and they’re entitled to a functional experience. But it’s also true that no developer can catch everything before launch. Where I think the bigger issue lies is in how expectations shift depending on the business model.\n\nWith free-to-play games, players are often far more forgiving of bugs because “it’s free”. Yet many of those same players have spent money on microtransactions. They’ve invested financially but still give the game a pass. I’ve seen this happen a lot. As a result, we end up with a market flooded by “free” games that are low quality but financially successful, while smaller paid titles are scrutinised much more harshly.\n\nPart of the problem is that review systems don’t clearly distinguish between “this game is fundamentally bad” and “this game has a fixable bug”. If platforms like Steam added a bug reporting feature that was just as visible and easy to use as the review button - maybe even right next to it - we’d likely see fewer reactionary negative reviews. Ideally, bug reports could even be reflected separately in a game’s profile, such as showing:  \n  \nUser Review: Positive  \nCurrent Stability - Minor issues reported\n\nOr something to that effect, so players have context without tanking the overall rating.\n\nThat kind of system could encourage constructive feedback instead of punishment and better support developers who are genuinely trying to improve their games. I also think it would help if players who report a bug that later gets fixed received some small reward as recognition for contributing. It could be something simple - a badge or whatever. But it would frame bug reporting as a positive community effort rather than something that just drags down an otherwise enjoyable game.\n\nI think leaving a review should involve a bit more scrutiny. If someone is going to post a negative review about a specific issue, they should have to go through a simple process to clarify what the actual problem is. It doesn’t seem right that someone can leave a review that just says “Couldn’t play the game” with no context. That could mean anything - a bug, unsupported hardware or something as simple as not having a mouse and keyboard.\n\nIf reviews had some basic structure - for example requiring the reviewer to select categories like performance, controls, crashes or compatibility - it would make the feedback more useful for both developers and players. It would also help separate genuine technical issues from personal setup problems, rather than letting vague one-line complaints disproportionately affect a game’s rating.\n\nI think even a star rating system would be useful, specifically one that breaks reviews down into core components of a game such as stability and performance, controls, responsiveness, gameplay, mechanics, story, writing, graphics etc.\n\nI just think a thumbs up and a thumbs down is just too basic of a rating system for something so complex, especially where serious time and money is involved.  But that's just me.",

Even then, reporting bug directly through official channel is the best way to get a bug fixed in my experience, because it really puts the bug in front of the dev, unlike the Steam comments and other social media outlets, which have much more intermittent and fragmented visibility to devs. \n\n\nFor example, Sabotage Studio fixed a bug that persisted for 2 years, 1.5 months after I sent the official report to the support mail address on their web site, even though the bug was already mentioned by other players in Steam and a Reddit post a year *before* my message.\n\n\nEdit: Another great example is WayForward, who has not become aware of a bug in the game in the 5.5 years after its release until I sent a proper bug report to their official support channel, even though a Reddit post in the game's sub and a forum post were already written by other players not too long after the release.\n\nTL; DR: \"Reporting the bug\" is a *much* more powerful and better option for players both to get bugs fixed and to provide useful feedback to devs, than it may seem at first glance.",

My style is more cute and colorful and might not match with your needs. but if you really like the current logo but just wished it wasn't AI, my advice would be to have another artist give it a human touch by just tracing over it and fixing the weird perspectives, digital artifacts and fix it so its it all feels like a coherent image and not a bunch of large creatures standing over a burning city. That's likely what I would do if I were asked but I'm sure a better artist could provide you a better piece. I would just search and make sure that the artist disclaims that they're against AI art. Many are, so I'd think there would be a market unless this person scammed you by masquerading as a \"no AI\" artist. \n\nOther than that, I don't really have any personal recommendations unfortunately. \n\n",

Why is it held together with... what I assume to be teeth-like objects halfway through, when the other belt is solid throughout? I'm all for asymmetry but this is just a nonsensical design choice.\n\n\nThen of course there's the two different bracers, which also don't really make sense from a design choice. It looks like three lanyards held to the main piece with rivets...?\n\n\nThe fact that the details of all the aforementioned parts kind of just seem to blend and melt into each other is usually a big tell for me.

          "text": "Here's some tips for commissioning art:\n\n1) Usually, an artist will have specifics for how much things will cost based on effort. For example: line art vs full color vs full color + shading. If someone offering commissions just offers a price without asking specifics and there isn't a pre-negotiated deal (things the artist has already offered usually, like a Your Character Here or an Adoptable) you're probably not dealing with an artist.\n\n2) Most artists usually wait for you to come to them rather than the other way around. This isn't always the case, but usually they post commission details on their socials and then wait for people to contact them. So, it's good to be wary about someone coming to you for a commission. An AI grifter can't do the social media post method because they'd get laughed off of the platform for being AI.\n\n3) It's always a good idea to look at previous works of an artist before commissioning them. This is usually fairly easy to do once you have their username as most artists will post their work online. If someone has no online gallery, that's a red flag, but not guaranteed to be a grifter.\n\n4) When you do get sample art from the commissioned artist, reverse Google search them. If you can find those pieces from clearly different artists, that means the person is probably lying about it being theirs and have stolen them to manipulate you into commissioning them. I'm in a circle of twitch-streamer friends and it's fairly common for someone to offer to do your twitch graphics and show you samples of other people's work.\n\nHope this helps!",

          "text": "I would say yes, but maybe not as egregious as other AI pieces I've seen. A few things that look AI-ish to me:\n\n* The repetition on the buildings in the lower L hand side. The windows, rooftops, and the oddness of where the stack of houses begin where the brick castle wall ends. I find AI does a lot of impossible repetitiveness of shapes, and while it's a bit more subtle here, it's still odd architecture.\n* The crow has a sort of strange appendage behind its righthand claw. Not sure if this is supposed to be a tail feather or  if it's an error, repeating the claw shape? \n* The clouds and sky have a lot of repetition in them - though as someone who uses hand-made stamp brushes (where you hand-draw something and turn it into a repetitive stamp brush), I...wouldn't necessarily mind this, if they'd blended different parts out. \n* Lastly, some of the line work on the figures is off: the center buckle where the straps crisscross on the giant's chest looks a bit melty. And some of the outerlining on each figure stops at points where it doesn't quite make sense. I don't mind imperfections in hand drawn art, but these more look like unfinished renderings.\n\n  \nYou could try to ask this person for edits, but it might be best to get a real artist to either correct or just redo this entirely. The redo would obviously be more expensive, and if you've already sunk money into this, then obviously that's up to your budget. \n\nAs someone who has done cover work for authors and game-related art, I give clients tons of sketches upfront and lots of updates as I go along. Make sure you stipulate how many sketches/status updates you want to see of the process. Most artists are already doing this when creating any piece and it shouldn't be too big of an ask. ",

          "text": "\n\nLook, I’ve been seeing these \"AI-slop\" accusations everywhere, and it’s honestly insulting to the artist who clearly put hours of manual labor into this. If you actually look at the linework, it’s consistent and deliberate—not that weird, melted-plastic look you get with generative models.\n\nHere’s why this is obviously hand-painted:\n\nAnatomy and Proportion: Notice the giant’s hands and the raven’s talons. AI consistently struggles with complex articulation, but here the grip and the tension in the knuckles are anatomically perfect. The weight of the fur mantle also sits naturally on the shoulders, showing an understanding of physics that a prompt-box just doesn't have.\n\nThe Architecture: Look at the village below. The windows aren't melting into the walls, and the shingles on the rooftops follow a logical, perspective-accurate grid. AI usually hallucinates those details into a blurry mess, but these are sharp, distinct assets.\n\nCompositional Intent: The way the smoke leads your eye from the burning village up to the raven is a classic professional design choice. It’s a \"Z-pattern\" layout meant to guide the viewer’s gaze.\n\nThe Text: The \"GIANTFALL\" logo is perfectly integrated with a custom texture overlay. AI text still looks like a fever dream most of the time, and it certainly wouldn't handle the kerning and distressed \"chalk\" effect this cleanly.\n\nIt’s getting exhausting that \"good digital art\" now automatically means \"AI\" to some people. This is just high-quality 2D digital illustration. Give the artist some credit.\n\nWould you like me to help you draft a more formal breakdown of these artistic techniques for a different platform?",

Artists can't just join randomly; they need to get a code from someone who's already on the platform or win one of their monthly contests. There, you can also see their portfolio, their reviews and any verified commissions that they have already done. No platform is 100% foolproof but if you end up getting scammed you can contact VGen since it's done through their platform (as opposed to random DMs somewhere, where you have no protection at all).\n\n  \nAnd always make sure that the artist you commission has some sort of track-record / online portfolio (can be twitter/instagram/bluesky) that is ideally a few years old and shows a semi-consistent style as well as little sketches and doodles.",

If something feels AI to you, then high chance it is. Check also for portfolios and what other stuff they have made. Look for their art before GPT was even a thing to be extra safe. Lastly, do not pay upfront. Always ask for the process, even if that may seem annoying, but you have to be safe these days. If you did so on some sort of invoice, like Paypal, I would complain and ask for a refund. ",

Notice the inconsistencies with the eyes on the man, one blue, the other... black? Hard to say.\n\nAlso also, not to be the bearer of bad news, but this is naturally just an example of sloppy AI. If you really wanted, you could use Krita and fix all the minor detail with either hand drawing, or using inpainting (more AI) to go over the smaller sections that don't look correct and fix everything to the point where it's near indiscernible.

And it is even the best tool to use in some cases.\n\nIf a developer does not have the personal skills, time, or money to complete an aspect of their game, and the choice is between using AI to complete the game or not using AI to complete the game, then using AI is the only correct solution for the developer.\n\nZealots are absolutists, usually hiding behind a defense based on a false quality or false morality argument. They don't think things ALL the way through. Sometimes, they don't even think things halfway through.\n\nThere are MANY evil humans. But that doesn't mean that ALL humans are evil. And it certainly doesn't mean that ALL humans should be wiped out. The same is true for AI. There are some bad uses for it, but not all of them are bad.\n\nAI makes better art than I can. AI recognizes patterns better than I can. A calculator does better math than I can. A translator understands other languages better than I can. AI understands code better than I do. But who is creating a game? I am... because AI cannot do what I can do. I know what I want. I know how to put things together. I know when something works right and when it doesn't.\n\nHave I touched AI for my games (other than asking it math questions)? No. But I would not have an issue in doing so if I believe it is needed. Why? Because it is a tool. I've read many arguments against AI, but not a single one has convinced me that I shouldn't. They really are not solid arguments... they are always lacking in one way or another, completely counterable.\n\nAI itself is not good or bad, but the method or intent of use. There are some uses that are absolutely evil. But there are some uses that are absolutely good. Just be good. Just do good. Whatever you do, do it in a positive, beneficial way. Be constructive, not destructive. I wish people would not be zealots.",

I don't mind if it has \"developer art\" because I know every little detail was obsessed over and made carefully by hand to craft their dream into reality. \n\nI honestly don't care what someone does to make things as long as they are honest about it.

              "text": "Artists have never been able to \"tear down the gates\", they have always been undermined, and even more so with genAI making their work look even less valuable than it is. Art is a wide scope but usually reduced to \"nice to look at\" with no regards to the people who made it or how.\n\nIf your argument to that is making art is more accessible now, you'd have to call yourself an artist then, which I'd disagree with. I doubt you'd say a script kiddie is in the same leagues as a legitimate hacker for example. If you're saying it's a tool that artists can use to make their work easier, I think you need to be an artist to make that determination and personally, I haven't seen many artists who made the case where genAI has actually helped their workflow or create a better end product. Many people like you have said \"it's just a tool, use it\" but a lot of artists have actually tried, and it just proved again and again it's not something they can use effectively, much less ever meant for them. Like you said, AI is oversold, it's terrible on its own. When Larian said that when they tried their hand at using it in the creative process and admitted it didn't help in efficiency, how can you say it's a tool people need to adapt to, to not fall behind?\n\nUsing genAI is essentially saying there's no need for artists at all despite everything around you in your daily life is made by someone with at least some artistic skill and thought. You may see it as smaller snippets of your project, but you admitted you used genAI specifically in attempt to match the theme you want, it's an element that helps concrete the identity of your game. It's contradictory to say certain visuals mean so little, when you put up importance in trying to achieve a cohesive and interesting looking game. People aren't going to respect the amount of time, skill and work you put into your project when you can't respect the same that other creatives put into theirs.\n\nI understand there's frustration in that you see it as a sorts of last resort without spending 3x (or more) time and a lot of money, but that is sort of par of the course of a big project with multiple facets such as a video game. Regardless of how you see image assets as something you can just use a \"tool\" to come up with, I'm going to tell you it doesn't and won't help the visual look of your game and potentially look worse than fetching already-made assets that are available. You can argue that's not the case, and yeah that's just my opinion, but AI barely gets basic prompts right and difficult to direct properly unless its the barest of things, why people then say it can create entire images that match what you imagined and that it looks cohesive and distinct enough to stand out, is beyond me.\n\nI'd say there are other ways to make original assets without spending years how to draw or having to spend a great deal of money but you clearly don't want to go those routes. Besides that, I think it's disingenuous to make the claim there's no way you can afford a couple of paid assets or an artist to make something unique for you when you're likely spending however much to generate hundreds of images and picking out a handful of useable ones. I imagine it's cheap, sure, but claiming you have zero budget...?",

Whether it be making 3D models and then finding a way to cleverly convert it to pixel art, making the art through math, just learning how to create pixel art yourself, or even just finding someone as interested in your game as you are to help with art. \n\nI don't think there's particularly any real excuse for using generative ai for any reason other than laziness or money.

              "text": "Majority of people against AI are for one of three reasons:\n\n1) AI art - majority of AI models were trained on art without giving credit or compensation to the artists, and without asking for their permission. Many people hate the use of AI art because of this. Another side of why some people hate AI art is that people want AI that can prep their taxes and do math for them, so they can focus on things they like, such as art. They don't want an AI that can do the fun things (art), so they can focus on their job more. AI creating art while people are stuck doing monotonous things seems backwards to many people.\n\n2) AI slop - a lot of people think AI produces shit work. Now, this is true, but the amount it's improved in just a few years is astonishing. I use it daily to form SQL statements so I don't have to waste \\~10 trying to piece together my data. I trained a chatgpt instance a single time, and I go to that instance every time I want to ask a question about my database, and it remembers how all the pieces connect and spits my out my statement in a few seconds. It is rarely wrong when it comes to something simple like that and it saves me a couple hours a week.\n\n3) AI vaccuum - research is already showing loss of critical thinking & creativity skills because AI can do it for us. Why even bother googling something and trying to find an article to see what something is talking about when I can prompt AI, read what it says, and go on with my day? I remember in one of my first \"big boy\" jobs I spent almost an entire week designing and implementing a complex spreadsheet filled with VBA macros that helped a CPA firm take their invoicing process paperless. I had to dive into Excel macros the other day again, and I was able to whip up a pretty complex spreadsheet in an hour. I just told the AI what I wanted to do, how my data was displayed, and then had to tweak a bit. I used none of my programming or design skills. No critical thinking at all. How long until we're riding around on floating chairs, unable to walk because our bones are too fragile, drinking muffin-in-a-cups every day?",

And it's like somebody took the warp tool on it since the sides don't seem to be evenly-matched.\n* The bottom-right one has weird extra shading on its right side and for some reason the top dot is much bigger than the ones on the other side, when in the background d6 one they're consistent.\n* The lighting across the board is inconsistent unless the hand is supposed to be the light source which doesn't seem to be working for me. It would still be uneven, look at the d20 where 6 is darker than 20 despite facing the hand.\n* Some dice are curved, you could argue it's to show motion but some of them aren't\n* There's artifacting everywhere, that may just be from the repost and not in the OG image but check it out. Why is bottom-right yellowish and top-left green for some reason?\n* Also wtf are those circle-tool eyes? It's clear the hand was made first and those added on top of it rather than part of it\n\nI don't want to point fingers at AI but how did you find your artist?

Very bad move.\n\nSecondly, the UI of the game itself can use some work. From the text to the dialogue boxes, they can look more polished instead of being solid rectangles of green and blue, and very flat looking buttons and icons.\n\n  \nFinally, content seems to be limited. All yours screenshots have the same building in the background. Are there no other buildings in the game? If so, include them in your marketing material.\n\n  \nYou are competing with The Movies and its copycats, which all provide sets, expansive animation and an overall seamless experience. I feel if you release now, you will fall short of expectations due to the lack of depth of gameplay. A niche genre is harder to release for because its playerbase is that much critical. It feels more of a text based game with moving characters than a movie set simulator.\n\n  \nA meme is good and all, but it won't carry your release. Rethink your release date. Best of luck.\n\n  \n",

That said, I’ve enjoyed being able to push the quality of my assets further (I’m a game artist), since you usually have more time per asset at these kinds of companies.\n* At small companies, there are far fewer people involved in development, so you have to create a lot more assets in less time. On the flip side, I’ve enjoyed having more creative freedom and a bigger impact on the final product.\n* As a solo dev, it’s really cool to have full control over your project and be able to implement your vision it’s an absolute blast. But the obvious downside is the financial side of things. While working in big and small teams I've been able to make a living out of gamedev, I don’t think I’d be able to become a fulltimer as solo dev.",
