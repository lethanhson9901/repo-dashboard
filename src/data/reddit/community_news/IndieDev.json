[Itch.io](http://Itch.io), alongside other sites (gog, steam), would give you a larger reach, and with the recent Discord news, it may no longer be the ideal place to have your community exclusively. Your game looks amazing; a lot of effort and heart went into its production. However, securing your community on multiple platforms would make it more accessible and ensure the game's survival isn't contingent on one site, multiple sites gives you more reach and is friendly for the growing anti-discord crowd. This might require more work on your part, but the work you've already done is amazing, and I'd personally hate to see it go if Discord goes the way of Skype.",

A few things that stick out to me:\n- something about the player character’s design feels off and out of place. Almost like they don’t match the rest of the world.\n- it looks like everything can be destroyed in a single hit. It makes everything feel like it’s made of paper. Ideally, different materials take a different amount of hits to break. The best example is when they attack the frog leaning against the wall. The wall gets destroyed as well.\n- it looks like xplosions are meant as the primary way to mine. Ideally there is still some kind of manual/melee way to do this for folks that are trying to terraform specific shapes.\n- sometimes it feels like the character is larger than there supposed to be or other elements are designed too small. For example, they are about half as tall as most trees and the explosions don’t seem very impressive because they’re just big enough for the character to fit through. It makes the character feel like a giant but also makes the enemies, creatures, explosions, and the general environment feel less impactful. For example the giant buff frog guy would look more intimidating if they were larger or the player was smaller.\n- in your video, you briefly show first person mode. This looks far more immersive compared to the rest of the video. I think because it solves some of the character problems I mentioned prior. Everything looks bigger in first person.",

For my money, this is what Minecraft _should_ look like in 2026. \n\nThe potential for voxel based games seems extraordinary to me. I’ve played games since the 8bit days and I remember feeling the sense of limitation when moving around early 3D environments and having them not react the way they should when hit with bombs or smashed by moving vehicles. How flat texture bullet holes would fade after a few moments. It felt like a shame not to be able to properly interact. \n\nMore recently having played games like Teardown and Donkey Kong Bananza it seems like we’re poised for a whole new level of environmental interactivity. The mind boggles at what we might see. I’m imagining, being a big Nintendo nerd, an open air Zelda where you can reshape the environment to cause mudslides and floods, direct lava to burn down enemy fortresses or melt a glacier to gain access to a dungeon. All done with real physics. It would be wild.\n\nThere are entire games you could build just using voxel based environments and directing water flows. If anyone remembers the fantastic Blast Corp from Rare back in the waaaaay back olden days, imagine that kind of gameplay with a fully realistic destructible world? \n\nI’m also thinking kaiju games with fully voxel based cities and landscapes that get destroyed in real time and different terrain responds differently to your physical or elemental attacks.\n\nAll told this feels like a new frontier. A step away from the polygon based perfection we’re now approaching into a new way of building 3D worlds that, as hardware improves, will become the new standard.",

So I partition the world in a 3d grid - so each enemy is assigned a grid location. Then each one only checks adjacent cells for other enemies, and if they intersect above a threshold, they get moved out the way. Then I can control the resolution of the grid to determine the accuracy of the collisions. With adjustment I think it could be way more efficient, it's quite rudimentary at the moment to be honest!",

I was building an entity system for a card game where units interact during combat, and I kept trying to make each entity \"smart\" -- tracking its own state, managing its own lifecycle, handling its own interactions. The codebase kept getting more tangled because every entity needed to know about every other entity. The breakthrough was realizing the entities don't need to be smart. They just need to be data. Move the intelligence into systems that operate on groups of entities rather than individual objects. Composition over inheritance was the phrase that clicked, but honestly the real shift was accepting that the architecture I'd already built was wrong and being willing to tear it apart.\n\nYour approach is the same principle at a much larger scale. Instead of 50k agents each running their own AI, you're treating the horde as a field -- spatial partitioning, grid-based neighbor lookups, sphere collisions as thresholds rather than simulations. The enemies aren't smart; the system that moves them is. And the result is that 50k entities with physics runs at framerate, which would be impossible if each one was individually \"thinking.\"\n\nThe HLSL approach for the collision logic is clever too. Curious whether you've hit any pain points with debugging GPU-side logic, since that's usually where the shader-as-gameplay-logic approach gets uncomfortable.",

          "text": "In my honest opinion the game simply isn't innovative enough. Is it cute? Hell yes. But art style does not sell the way it used to. What about the gameplay? Metroidvanias are quite done to the death and when you remove combat you sort of remove a thing people hearing about metroidvanias also come for, thus cutting some audience out.\n\nI don't know how you marketed your game exactly so it is hard for me to say whether you did it right or not in the retrospective. You didn't give us any wishlist or copies sold numbers either. SteamDB estimates you sold between 1K and 2.3K copies of the game. I can imagine after 7 years, this is unprofitable, especially in France.\n\nAverage players per day is rather meaningless for a game you play once and never again. I think it's pretty pricy too. Even if the game got the huge recognition you wanted, it should die out eventually, that's a normal and health lifecycle for games.\n\nMy game has certainly a tiny audience right now and I too hear people say it's a hidden gem in the making or that they were waiting for a game like that for years. And that's super encouraging, but it is sadly not equal to success just yet. The goal is not to make a perfect game for a few people, but good enough game for great many people.\n\nI think this is a good example of a game that was overengineered. The concept was simple, but the amount of work put into polish and art was simply disproportionately large to the amount of gameplay itself. In my opinion.\n\nI want to quote this one review you got:\n\n>It's ok.\n\n>I appreciate the thought and care that went into a randomizable modular Metroidvania like this. Took ambition to step outside of the norm and attempt something unique. And I do love the decidedly French aesthetic.\n\n>However, there's just not enough meat on the bone to justify the high price tag. There's very little to do in the game besides the \"fetch quest\" portion of the genre (no combat, no puzzles, no secrets, etc). I wonder what the fortune cookies were originally meant for; perhasps a currency to use at the fortune teller? Because as it is now, with the fortune teller being free, there's really no point in avoiding going to her every step of every game and just mindlessly going wherever she tells you, ruining the game's fun at no expense.\n\nSo someone who did play arrived at the same conclusions more or less.\n\n\\-----\n\nSo what would I do?\n\nWell, you have an amazing core, I mean the game is beautiful, so just make more of it. Add more levels, but add more mechanics, add puzzles, add secrets, add more things a player can interact with, manage, intertwine those and try to add them back to into the old levels if possible. Even just reuse assets, but try to make it mechanically more engaging.\n\nI don't think you can suddenly turn the game around. Buuuuuut, you can make a sequel. Reuse the assets, add mechanics, but benefit from fresh wishlist count, fresh opportunity at demo and steam fests, and of course you can send that notification via steam to all players of the old game. And sequels seem more interesting to press I think since it indicates the game was successful enough. It doesn't matter the game didn't sell as well as you wanted to, because it did sell at all and that's good. So capitalise on it. That's my advice.",

The only special thing I saw was the random items, which feels more like a \"gotcha\" than a mechanic, and I couldn't see much value on it. It's far from a core mechanic IMO.\n\nThe problem I see is that the game is in the middle of multiple genres, and doesn't really scratch any of the genres itches.\n- For a puzzle game, feels not challenging, if at all (again, I didn't play it)\n- For a metroidvania, I don't see the metroidvania at all. It looks like a platformer, if something. A generic platformer\n- For a rogue lite, I don't see it either. And I'm a huge fan. Very mild. In the trailer, I see the items are randomly generated, and... The map? Everything else is just a platformer\n- As an adventure/story game, I could see its value. But it's not marketed as such. \n\nSo, or looks good, but feels very niche, and had that \"flash game\" feeling in it that can't justify the price. \n\nAnd, again, take all of that with a grain of Sakura, as it's based on the trailer and images.

It's that very little people actually know about the game in the first place.\n\nI think it's more about marketing your game. Man, like, watching Two Star videos about Choo-Choo Charles made me get back into game dev! If you do YouTube shorts, you reach a wider audience. I dunno.. the truth is, the market is pretty oversaturated and to actually sell the game, people have to know about it, right? It has to be hype somehow.. \n\nThe difficult truth of today's world is game consumers mainly look for looks. When I usually listen to people gloss over games, it's about how close to reality the game is (\"You shoot a rocket at a building and it actually collapses into rubble!\"). I'm kind of scared to that myself, not gonna lie. It means if I really want to launch a money making game, I'm going to have to invest in high quality assets and compromise on the performance **a lot**.\n\nGood luck mate\n\n\n\nEdit:\nOkay dude, I have now watched the trailer you posted for your game and I can safely say there's a ton of reasons why I won't download it or play it myself:\n\nFirst off -  The issue of \"My game is a combination of X game and Y game with Z game elements\". Dude, do YOU. Why would you even mention the games you copied the mechanics of? I get it, as a developer, you want other devs to understand what you want to achieve, but as a creator, you need to talk to the audience in these trailer videos.. What you need is something original, something unique. A player might say \"Well that's just Game X and Game Y\", but by then it won't matter if the game is fun.\nI mean, why play a clone game when you can play the original, right?\n\nSecond, I saw a lot of interactions with objects. And a lot of text from you. It didn't feel personal, as in, no voice. The little joke you tried to pass at the end was actually the moment I understood why nobody downloaded the game. You need to sell it - which brings me to point 3.\n\nI virtually have no clue what would I do in your game. If I showed this trailer to someone and said \"So, you wanna play?\", the answer's gonna be \"Play WHAT? What do you do?\" And just by watching the vid, I have no idea. What's the purpose? I mean, do you get creative in there? Release stress? Break stuff? Earn something? A story? WHY should someone play the game? \nPut that in the trailer, rather than some silly jokes.\n\nAlso, \"Another reason for a bathroom break\".. Man, I cringe for you. Makes me wonder how old actually are you..\n\nHope you actually learn from my POV. Don't take it personally. Apply yourself",

I saw he made a bunch of videos about his other games, like Paper smile or something of the sort - And he just didn't break through before. \n\nSecond, watch what he's actually doing in the videos. He picks a random part of the game creation that shows you what he's doing and talks about it in a funny, short way. He answers some question posed to him by anonymous people, he interacts. His door is almost always locked or blocked for some reason, as if he was trying to keep something out, which I think he actually just never talks about.. It's something interesting. A hook of a sorts. It's not really your typical gamedev video.\n\nTwoStar happened to produce a high quality character with an appropriate level of creepiness and also managed to market the game very well.

But the form that aesthetic needs to take is highly dependent on context. Only a small subset of games actually benefit from the sort of realism you're talking about. A platformer where you play as a talking mouse really isn't where you need to be concerned with realism. But you still do need to consider aesthetics and presentation.",

The way YouTube works, you really have to make a lot of content, and then start finding the couple that worked out and start aiming toward that strategy. Also run ads for videos that \"blow up\". (300 views when you usually get 1-2 is blowing up).\n\nAs the other poster mentioned, I don't really know what to expect from your game trailer. And $17.99 is a lot for an unknown indie game.\n\nFrom what I see, this is more in the $8 range. \n\nYou need to make a better trailer, showing what the player will do, and why. And outlining the story, why the mice keep going on adventures?\n\nThen make a lot(100+) shorts about the story, unlocks, etc. 15-30 seconds long and release them daily.\n\nIdeally one or two of those will get some real traction from the algorithm, and then you can start advertising those. Basically rinse and repeat that process. (Throw in other platforms like YouTube, and Instagram) Give copies out for free to streamers and communities with giveaway keys for them.\n\nAs for the price, when you start running ads, I would tack on a 50% off sale for a few weeks. To get the intro price at a better place. Also makes impulse buys more likely.\n\nMost games on steam launch with a 10% off discount because that's the threshold to get into the deals frontpage on steam.\n\nThe other thing I would say about your game, is it feels very child oriented, with the bright and vibrant pastel colors.",

Your game may justify the price, but unfortunately the art style alone is hard to sell with higher prices. If nothing worked anyway, try to make an update to the game and make a marketing beat about \"Update + price drop\". Maybe this is your last chance. Looking at other devs, you can go all in on one idea, work for years and hope the best, or you test the appeal of your game often and early so that you can be sure that enough people like it. But your game is already released. I think a last straw could be taking all your assets and systems and make a whole new game out of it that is much smaller in scope while you test very often (prototype) and very early.\n\nEdit: After watching the trailer I still don't exactly know what the game really is about. One way to find your niche audience is to very clearly communicate what the game is about. There is 2D platforming, items, metroidvania-style progress, something about escaping, and you put heavy emphasis on the \"randomness\" aspect (hence the title). But I can't quite grasp it when watching the trailer.",

That's valid but you can't really expect anyone else but you to care about that.\n\nThat being said, even if a great call to action was included, this artstyle is just not appealing, it doesn't look 'painterly' or 'endearing', it looks cheap: no shading, super washed out colors, every line is too clean...

If i really needed to play an exploration focused one, you can get knytt underground for a dollar most of the time.  \nI just don't see anything that makes me go \"okay this game has this one different thing i can't get anywhere else\". The first sentence of the blurb for the game is about what it \\*doesn't\\* have, which is terrible from a marketing standpoint",

But imo before you make a new push on your game’s facelift you should respond to some of the feedback here. The most important feedback I see is: What is the call to action for the mouse? Why is he going through the maps? This idea could make all the different for you I hope you’re paying attention: At the beginning of each run play one of maybe 20 short cinematic clips with a backstory for this run. Introduce some characters which give your mouse a call to action. Introduce maybe a love interest, a nemesis, etc. Try to lean into that throughout the run. That answers the call to action, of why your mouse is in this situation/why completing this run matters. Also there should be some unlocks you get between runs even if it’s just cosmetics for your mouse. If I were making your mouse game there are several things I’d do differently. When you start a run ask yourself “am I eager to play and finish this run because it has a purpose”? Even you as the dev should struggle to put your game down if it’s done right. \n\nIf you don’t want to give a call to action give a timer for the run instead, and add in little items that add to the clock. A finite clock timer is a call to action, and can be enough to keep people engaged. TLDR: Every game needs urgency/character investment/a purpose for playing. For a game like terraria, your purpose is the next weapon, the next set of armor, killing the next boss, exploring the next biome, etc. Crafting in and of itself is rewarding, as is seeing biomes, as is beating bosses. Terraria’s singular call to action is beating every boss, and you must craft a ton of items to do that. Why are we completing your runs? What’s your call to action? Is it that we only have 10 minutes to save the mouse Princess from something? Imagine if each run began with a story cinematic and ended with a non-combat boss fight that used your unlocks and the environment to fight back? Suddenly you’ve got an engaging game. Be creative and make something that attracts even you to play and complete runs. ",

Neither the voice or the recording quality sound remotely professional.\n\nYou need to focus on conveying to the viewer what the gameplay is like, what the goal is, and how you get there. The segment in the second trailer where it's rocket/grapple/pins is good - make a whole trailer with those kind of things. And try to show more environments, it looks very samey. Is there a main goal? A hint of a final level or \"boss\" section? You should tease that, whatever it is.\n\nEDIT: And sorry but the price is *waaaay* too high for Steam. You might feel it's \"worth\" that much but the market would expect a lot less for a game like this. You'd probably sell like hotcakes at 8 with 33% off. 18 euro is bananas.

The platformer genre is an insanely tough market on steam.\n2. I think the genre mash of cozy metroidvania may be working against itself too much and putting people off from both genre's\n3. I think you did a great job on the art it looks like it's from those old hidden object games. I also think that same vibe might turn off some people from your game because it can feel aged or rough around the edges.\n4. I think the price is fair but some people may find it to be way too high for what the game is to them. You'll need to leverage discounts to bring in more sales.\n\nI'm not saying your game is doomed but I think those core features of your game make it a uphill battle in an already heavily competitive market.\n\nI think if its as good as people are saying it is I think you just need to give it some time and attention to give it the best shot of turning things around.\n\n- Keep working on the challenges, keep working on bug fixes. Put out updates regularly (like every 2-3 months)\n- Keep reaching out to streamers and youtubers that haven't played your game yet. don't spam them just reach whenever you put out a new update.\n- Put it on discount whenever you put out an update it well help draw in new players.\n- start planning and prototyping your next game during this time as well.\n\nGive it another 6-9 months then move on.\n\nOr don't and start working on your next game right now.\n\nEven if the game doesn't take off, don't look back at this as a failure. You did a great job on this. You made a game, put it out there and it's way better than the average first release.\n\nFor your next game I would focus on a shorter development cycle, and a genre that performs better on Steam.",

          "text": "Oooof that's rough.\n\nFirst of, I'm sorry you got to that point and feel disappointed by the results. Genuinely.\n\nSecond, I think what to do depends on what energy you still have for that project. I you sold, let's say, 2k copies, I don't think anyone is under the impression that you have a moral duty to support the game further with the promised content. That's the challenge but also the grace you have as a solo dev: you are not held at the same standards as studios or companies wide endeavour. \n\nSo here is the different things I would consider if you don't want to work on the same game:\n\n1-Lower the base price under 15€. And I would even go lower than that at 9.99€, when in the 15-20€ bracket you are compared to Blasphemous 1 and 2, or Hollow Knight and Silksong...like this is unfortunate, and these games were released some time ago, don't have the same vibe and all, but this is unfortunately the type of comparison you have to face\n\n2-Make a deep discount for a short period, one that'll make people who wishlisted the game see a popup on Steam and impulse buy. With a bit of luck, this might bring a couple more people to actually try the game and if they like it spread good word.\n\nI don't think that can save the game per se, but that can at least try and salvage it without to much input on your part.\n\nIf you still want to work on the game though:\n\n3-Maybe prepare a big update, new challenges, or new backgrounds, or new story bits or even mechanic (though that is way harder to bring). Maybe, try and make a new character you can choose from that brings a different vibe to the dialogues...and then you repackage that either as a big update 2.0 thing with a new Steam Capsule and trailer (I'll get to the trailer after that) OR as a DLC.\n\n4-Salvage all you already have and make a sequel, if you feel passionate enough to make that.  \n\\----\n\nAll of this being said, from the outside looking in, and with the upmost respect for making the game, sticking with it through years of dev, and releasing it (I really do mean it, and the game looks cool)...I think you are overestimating the uniqueness of your concept, both as a gameplay mechanic and also as a thing you need to market.\n\nThe trailers on your YT channel is baffling to me, but I think is emblematic of your vision of your game that is making you miss the forest for the tree: because your inspiration is randomizers, that's what you are trying to sell. But effectively...for the lay-player, it's a Metroidvania with a spoon of RNG on top. You have a minute of a voice over explaning what a randomizer is, when we've had a decade of rogue-likes and games with random pick-ups in slightly changing rooms. And I KNOW that the difference is that the levels don't change, but the placement of objects do. But that doesn't make a huge difference in how you approach marketing it.\n\nI see your page, I just don't really know what I'm buying, even the description is unclear of if it has a story, what the goal is; and at 17.99€, I'm not taking the chance, unfortunately, when I could buy Silksong for 2 more euros.\n\nThere might also just be something missing visually or in the rhythm of the trailers...maybe you should have more variation than bright warm desaturated colors for the background that makes it feels like there is just one room in the screenshots or trailer. Idk. \n\nI'll try the demo tonight though since it's Steam Deck verified (kudos for that). \n\nI hope the best for you and your future endeavour. And may your next game be a success :)",

                  "text": "Anyone looking at the game right now is bouncing off due to price so... what's the point in keeping that price then?\n\n1. Looking at the game and the presentation objectively, the simplistic children's book aesthetics does not speak to me, so the positive reviews present the biggest draw - but there are too few for them to be reliable. If your game is as great as you say, then selling tons of copies for cheap will make it more appealing for more poeple. As it stands, this looks a lot like an inspired flash game that I'd play for 10 minutes to find out how it innovates, and might stick with until the end if it is good - not the type of game that can compete with Silksong and others in the 20 bucks pricerange.\n2. Randomizers are popular with a specific niche of people who have nostalgia for those randomized games (Zelda ALttP, Super Metroid, etc.). Getting excited together for something they were excited for as kids, and potentially competing against each other in a game they spent countless hours on as kids is the main draw. Also, the fact that randomizers are free and community-created gives them an air of freedom and community. Monetizing a game in this space that lacks the installbase / brand recognition of classic titles was never gonna be easy.\n3. The concept of randomizers is not inherently clear to \"normies\" - and even when they get it, it's not inherently appealing. Anyone can understand that in roguelikes you can find LEGENDARY items/perks sometimes, so if you get lucky, you'll be super powerful. This is also where much of the fun of popular randomizers comes from: At any time, you might get the hookshot or strongest sword and jump in power in a way the game does not intend. Or you could find somethingthat has a quirky hidden use (like the insect net vs Aghanim) that is not obvious at first. While not being overtly gambling, it has the same appeal as a gambling machine. Contrasting this with your game, here one could find tacks that let you climb walls - so then you climb a wall... Doesn't feel like \"breaking the game\", right? Rather feels like you're doing a necessity - like you're just doing exactly what the designer intended. If we broke down randomizers to their most basic core, we would arrive at several colored doors cluttering a room filled with colored keys. Just collecting keys and opening doors to get more keys would be an incredibly dull experience - so the actual game you build around it must already be appealing and varied before even adding the randomizer element.",

It looks like you mashed a bunch of different ones together and so end up appealing to none.   \n  \nI enjoy metroidvanias and roguelike type random things but this hits neither hook. Metroidvanias don't have random unlocks they are very purposeful in progression, and you don't tend to do multiple runs of a metroidvania like your seems to suggest you do, which could be a cool unique thing about your game but you don't really mention how that actually effects gameplay other than going to location in a different order which isn't all that exciting. The randomisation doesn't seem to serve much purpose, its not like you'd end the game with a  completely different build every time you just change the order of where you go?   \nYou say there's a 20 hour campaign but endless replayablility and no indication of how that makes sense, am I to play the whole campaign again just going about the locations in a different order? Why would I do that?  \n  \nYou hint at speed runners too, it sounds like these mechanics would work for that but you've not really advertised it in that direction. \n\ngraphically it looks good and well made I just think you seem to be trying to sell it to too broad an audience.

I don’t think this is strictly necessary but you might want to find a way to hint at them.\n* In-game strings in your trailer and your descriptions in your press kit read like you translated them into English from French yourself. The trailer unique dialogue doesn’t have the same problem. This reads as a little janky. For example “A clean underwear” -> either leave the article off or expand all the way to “a pair of clean underwear”\n* Also on your announcement: “February’s challenge is there” is not how English speakers write and is extremely passive in English.\n* Your genre skews old and hardcore but your art and setting skews young and casual/cozy. That’s not really solvable but I think you might need a different trailer for each audience that emphasizes what they want to see.\n* Don’t make trailers that can’t be understood without sound on. Steam mutes it by default.\n* Your concept trailer looks like a dev room. Try to find better gameplay footage. Possibly from someone’s actual run.\n* Related to gameplay footage, if your abilities are interesting in combination, sell me on that. I only see you using one at a time.\n* You are using the rocket and breaking lights/glass too much, it’s not interesting or you’re not selling why it’s interesting.\n* Your trailer is probably better off not explaining what an item randomizer is (niche, boring) but instead explain what the gameplay experience will be like. For instance “Your starting abilities change every run. Can you escape every time!?” Or your “no two escape attempts are the same” wording from your steam blurb is decent. Lead with that hook at the beginning of a trailer.\n* It’s clear that item randomizers were your inspiration, but your inspiration and how you talk to the public do not need to be the same thing. Figure out what a person who has never heard of a randomizer wants to hear to be excited for your game.",

My takes from a fairly \"normal\" point of view, and also from a fan of metroidvania is, in rough order of thoughts when first entering your page  \n\\- \"combat-free Metroidvania\" really seemed something that I would enjoy, yay!  \n\\- Tried watching the first video, hmm it's about some item randomizer? Neat, but I want to know what it's about.   \n\\- Tried second video, hoping it's some sort of pitch as to what the game is about, aside from \"metroidvania\". But that seems to be a longer explanation about item randomizer and that people like it?  \n\\- There's no more trailer  \n\\- I read the text again at the top right, you're supposed to escape? From the house presumably? But doesn't mice like living in houses? What's the motivation exactly? Just because?\n\nThat's where I normally would have dropped out, the video and photos, while looking interesting, didn't hook me. If it had some sort of filter that made it look more frame-by-frame animated I would probably have been pushed over the edge despite not having really any information from the top part of the page, maybe.\n\nAfter reading a bit more on your page it does seem like some sort of escape-the-house situation, with cutesy characters and a bit rogue-ish elements with item randomisers (now at least).\n\nHowever, my initial impression was that it seemed that you got a bunch of tools that you could use in different ways, but what you actually DID in the game was very unclear. Informing about updates is fine, but not having a game trailer for me really did it in for me, as for something \"niché\" as a combat free metroidvania, explaining what the game is about is doubly important.\n\nI do think adding some variated screenshots would also help, three out of the five screenshots is very samey, which communicates to me that it's a small game (which it may or may not be).\n\nLongwinded, but hopefully you'll get the ball rolling again, it does look interesting and i wish you the best",

And having played it, I still don't think I'd pay 17.99. Are you taking part in Steam Next Fest?",

There's a saying in the industry, \"every game is someone's favorite game\". It's meant to be an encouragagement to do weird things, but also a warning against focusing too much on positive feedback. Don't let praise get to your head.\n2. The problem of discoverability is THE biggest problem in modern gamedev. Amazing games with muli-million dollar budgets can get overlooked, because they chose a bad time-frame to release. As an indie dev, you should be patient - don't expect an explosion of popularity on launch, grind at it, possibly for years. I've had multiple games go unrecognized on launch, to slowly pick up sales with time.\n3. Your trailer is by far your biggest selling tool. And your trailer is pretty bad. The whole point of a trailer is to suck people in the first few seconds, and then sell them the core fantasy of the game in the next 30 seconds or so. In your case, the artstyle does somewhat draw me in, but the rest of the trailer feels random, disjointed and meandering. Show me a puzzle I need to overcome, and a clever way I will do it in the game. Or multiple ways, using different equipment. Make me want to try doing it myself.\n4. This one is a matter of personal taste: randomisers are cool, because they allow you to refresh an already amazing game. Randomiser of a game I have no emotional connection to does not excite me whatsoever. (I'm pretty sure that's also why randomiser fans aren't interested. You're mistaking garnish with protein). Neither does calling it a materoidvania x rogulike (because there's already been a bunch of amazing games in that subgenre - e.g. Dead Cells, Rogue Legacy, Sundered). Throwing around genre descriptors might catch interest of some enthusiasts, but it won't excite the majority of players, You need to sell the actual gameplay/story to them.\n\nEDIT: Having played through the demo twice (once normally, once randomized) - it fun, but not exactly innovative or deep. I bet it would sell well for 10$ (discounted to 5$ regulary) for one evening of fun",

          "text": "The goal of the game is not clearly stated. It seems aimless. I personally enjoy Metroidvanias, but the Roguelite element of it takes away from the metroidvania element. The appeal of Metroidvanias to me is the time spent in the world overcoming challenges, then after some big challenge I get a permanent unlock that enhances the game. If each run is only minutes I feel like I have no investment in my character. I would much rather a single large map to traverse, like Hollow Knight. I’m not sure the Roguelite concept works well without combat. Ultimately, Roguelite will appeal to one group of players and Metroidvania will appeal to a different group, and they don’t really overlap much. Metroidvania players like a long, tough playthrough slowly getting unlocks. Even if your metroidvania doesn’t have combat it should have enemies to avoid or obstacles that can hurt you. What are the sources of danger your mouse gets to avoid with all of its cool tools? From the trailer I just see a mouse in a world without threats zipping around the screen which does make it feel empty to me. Add to that that a run is short and afterwards all progress is lost and I’d get so bored. ",

          "text": "Hey, I checked out your game’s Steam page, and at first glance I think the main issue is the preview material (videos and images). Even though the art is charming and clearly shows the love and effort you put into it, the way it’s presented in the trailer isn’t very appealing. On top of that, the game loop isn’t very clear, and the originality isn’t immediately noticeable. Since you mention famous games and genres, it ends up feeling more like a copy than something unique, which didn’t spark my interest.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. Try to distance your game from others, avoid comparisons or mentioning similar titles.\n2. Highlight the strongest aspects of the game, especially the original mechanics. Make it feel like a unique experience that players can’t find anywhere else, creating a sense of FOMO.\n3. Emphasize the nostalgic appeal of the art style: childhood, relaxation, imagination, creativity, and handcrafted visuals. It reminds me of drawing, coloring, and classic 2D animation.\n4. Localize prices for important markets that don’t operate in dollars. I live in Brazil, one of the biggest gaming markets in the world, but our currency is weaker. Ten dollars is more than 50 reais, which feels expensive for a non-hyped indie game. I’d recommend a range between 10–25 reais.\n5. Send free keys to streamers & youtubers who focus on indie games.\n6. Consider investing in marketing campaigns on social media (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram), including ads or paid influencers, but only after improving and validating the preview materials.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nYou’ve already done the hardest part, which is making a good game. Now you just need solid marketing. Unfortunately, for indie developers, we need to understand a bit of everything, not just game development, but also marketing and sales. With improved preview materials and a clearer presentation, it could even be worth considering a small relaunch to give the game the visibility it deserves.",

And lastly I would recommend to try exploring demographics of regions outside Europe and US, I think that the gameplay of it is very similar with a lot of Japanese Doujinshi Games, so maybe your game can be more popular there, this is more common than what you would expect. And If it's possible and you have means to do it, a Nintendo Switch port can also helps a lot, it's more easy for devs to hit on Switch than Steam.",

I can't tell you what to do better (and I honestly don't think many here can either) but I can tell you why I personally would've never even considered downloading the demo were it not for this post:  \n\\- never heard of it in the first place  \n\\- the trailer/screenshots/presskit don't get the idea of the game across very well  \n\\- while I understand this is personal preference, the color palette and general art style doesn't fit. I can see it working for me in a cozy hand-crafted puzzle game, maybe a point&click or visual novel. But for this genre everything is blending together too much for me.  \n\\- it looks kinda like a flash game  \n\\- price way too high  \n\\- don't care much for the randomizer\n\nWhat did work for me:  \n\\- roguelite x metroidvania sold me on trying the demo out  \n\\- the mechanics in the demo were fun and exploitable with a bit of clever thinking (massive plus for me)  \n\\- the story was introduced very well, even when skipping through some if not most dialogs I got hooked  \n\\- intuitive world design\n\nWhat I would change if it was my game (I know I said I can't tell you how to fix it, but I can tell you how I would go about it):  \n\\- one or more of the following: darken the palette / increase outline sizes / zoom the camera in more / saturate the colors more. The combination of having none of the above is making the game feel like vomit on screenshots. Something about too many things blending together into a monotone soup with nothing to catch your eye. This is not a problem when you're playing the game because you intuitively understand where you are and where you're going, but in the screenshots the player is too tiny and with too little contrast to everything else that the mechanics that the screenshots showcase don't pop out at all. You can sell it in person or with 1 on 1 interactions with players by explaining but you can't do the same thing on a steam page. I think it'd be fine if you just darkened the background, increased the outline to maybe even triple and saturated foreground more.  \n\\- pick a single main selling point (I'd personally pick the game mechanics) and laser focus on it on the steam page, only tangentially mention related selling points. Advertize to your audience - as far as I can tell from the demo there's no enemies or fighting in this - it's a pure platformer + puzzle more so than a metroidvania + roguelite.  \n\\- Widen your advertizing - everybody is doomscrolling, heck that's how I found half the games I bought last year. I know it's not always fun to make that content, but you really don't have to - you already have a bunch of people who played your game, just clip their gameplay (probably with consent) and keep posting. It only takes one 30 second clip to blow up, especially with this game as the mechanics can easily be understood from a 30 second clip while the broader implications of their existence is left in the viewers mind, selling it instantly. Remember that it takes a while before the algorithms on social media sites pick up what kind of content you're showing and what kind of people would enjoy it, so just keep at it.\n\nI would buy this in a heartbeat if it was the exact same game with entirely different graphics, I can't very well tell you to overhaul that entirely. It wouldn't be fair, that takes way too much time and money. I still think the suggestions above would help though and not at much cost, most of them would just be tracing or applying filters to existing textures.",

Liked the whole concept, art style. it did grab my attention.\n\n  \nnow the issue (say as a customer, not a dev) is that there is not much of a market presence of your game. The product is great (even the reviews agree!), but there is just not much info about the game's existence. And it is ironic that i got to know of your game from this post (which ironically is about why the game is not getting any attention). so you must work on getting the game in public's eyes.\n\n2nd issue (to me at least) is the pricing. i did saw comments talking about that, but there is more to it. now the game costs 810 INR, not on sale, which is already a lot, considering that skyrim ae costs roughly the same on sale. whereas for Indie games, the prices generally stay around 400-500 Rupees, which is literally half of Randomice's price. I remember buying stardew valley for 450 INR at full price, but the price is fully justifiable and not crack someone's wallet apart lol. Saying this because 810 Rupees is a lot (literally two months' worth of commute money for me!).\n\n\n\nSO yeah, best recommendation from me (again, as a customer, not a dev) is to focus on the marketing heavily, and reduce the pricing a little. The game has potential, and it deserves the success. Best wishes to you!",

That sounds like an *extremely* niche audience you're catering to, Metroidvania players don't want to just explore and backtrack, they want to *fight stuff*.  Likewise if I wanted a game like Myst but with mice, or a randomized puzzle game, I definitely would not be describing or searching for anything that I'd remotely call a \"metroidvania\" because that word means something totally different.\n\nYou might have better luck describing your game as a side scrolling puzzle adventure game.  It sounds like you've made a quality game, but you're just marketing your game in a way that only gets it in front of the *wrong* audience by invoking the wrong key terms and comparisons.",

I think ultimately this one just didn’t happen for you. \n\nI think you should go read Chris Zukowski’s blog on How to Market a Game. He talks about failed launches and what to do. \n\nIn general, his advice when this happens is always, fix any bugs and move on to your next game. You can’t really save a failed launch. \n\nHe also says to use this as a learning experience, “your first game always fails” and use all the skills you’ve developed to release a small game in a popular genre.\n\nI bet you’d do super well with using some of the mechanics and art you’ve developed here in a different, more popular genre. Metroidvanias are extremely difficult to pull off and their audience is hard to impress (as you can see). \n\nTry a more popular genre and I bet you’d be surprised how different it feels to launch. And aim for like a six month dev time.\n\nSee what happens!\n\nI’m sorry this didn’t go well for you. Best of luck. Keep going.",

It's a whole different conversation on what a game should really cost and i know it's kindof annoying to be told your game is not worth that, i'm sure the sweat and tears you put into it is worth it, but you need to see your competition and why they can be priced like that.\n\nI don't have any type of experience on this but, if was as in your position i would:\n\n\\- Apply a discount NOW, to bring it as close as possible to 10 dls, crazy i know.  \n\\- Consider in the next month to permanently reduce the price to that depending on the increased performance.  \n\\- Work on a small update adding languages and fixing bugs. This is key, since you can send your game with a free key to gaming media outlets in those new languages. Try finding new media outlets or people who write about the games you made, it seems cozy and cute so i would try finding \"influencers\"/journalists that play those type of games.  \n\\- I would try to get reach out to platforms like twitch prime gaming, or the epic games store and see if they might be interested in having deals with you since your game is already out.  \n\\- Release the game in other platforms/os (macos). Try bringing it to consoles.  \n\\- Go to instagram, tiktok, snapchat and make content about how you make this game and your story. But the game needs to be affordable so interested people don't find friction. (this one is a playing the long game tbh).  \n\\- Pay for ads, but be smart about it, do it close to a new version/platform release.  \n\\- Go to meetups, conventions, local gaming events, showcase your game and do giveaways, give rewards to people talking about it online.  \n\\- Do streams of the game in steam, twitch, youtube. Show people how fun it is.\n\nBy no means this is a failure imo, and you still have the post launch battle. The game is done and that's much more many games can say + the fact people are playing it even at that price is great.\n\nBtw if you end up reducing the price, try compensating existing users with a cool hat or something exclusive to them!\n\n  \n",

The trailer, the Steam images, description, bio; none of it really feels like something I'd spend that much money on. I'd maybe wishlist and wait for a significant sale. My only recommendation moving forward in game development is to start making focus groups. You need to get quality feedback on what people are willing to pay for your games, and you need to do it early on before years of development are put in. Bring people into a very early pre-alpha, let them know the planned scope at release, and have them tell you what price they would be willing to pay for the game. This will give you a good idea on where you should put your focus and how much should be sunk into the game.",

Long dev cycles are way too risky. You can’t make very many games in a lifetime if they all take 7 years. Life is short.\n\nThe Switch audience may like it more. Steam users don’t usually go for metroidvanias unless it’s huge like Hollow Knight or Ori. Steam users also don’t love cute/lighthearted in that genre. Cute and dark works better, or just dark. If you haven’t gone through Chris Zukowski’s visibility and wishlists masterclass on indie game marketing for Steam, you should. He has a ton of insight and a plan for marketing alongside development. I would download all that info into your brain while developing your next game. He basically warns against making this type of game you made because it won’t sell well.\n\nVery sorry you had this experience. The game does look cool to me. I don’t think the price is the problem if there is a lot of content. It is more the visual theme and genre not being a good combo for Steam. I wish you the best of luck on your next game!

          "text": "Disclaimer: I haven't sold any games, I'm just spitballing here, 0 expertise on my side.\n\nThe steam review that highlighted that this game is unique, challenging and engaging and most importantly, that there are multiple \"solutions\", as in, several ways to traverse a room by using items and so on kinda sold me on the game, especially with the claim that they've been having fun playing for 100 hours. Also, the description of the game itself looks fantastic.\n\nBut the trailer... My first worry was that the mice are small and coloured similarly brightly as the background, so they're harder to see... (Metroid had Samus in her orange red suit, hollow knight is bigger on the screen, ori glows and all three have a dark background, making characters stand out; 2D mario wears bright red and while the background is bright, it's very simple, you won't lose track of him). Some platformers may use thicker lines for the ground, but they usually try to make the player stand out.\n\nWhen I look at randomice, the mice are grey and have a similar saturation and line thickness to the background, and perhaps this is because I only watched the trailer on my phone where the screen is too small anyway and I couldn't play the sound, but I worry my eyes will lose track of the mouse...\n\nIt's not a super duper cute mouse like how Hollow Knight is adorable, nor is it a super recognisable character like Mario. The design is simple, not bad at all, and it is still cute (mice are definitely cute and charming) but the style makes me think of an educationsl children's game. Nothing wrong with that ofc. If it was me, I'd gave added basic customization, like letting the player choose to wear a red cape or funny hat or little things like that or something, but this is just my personal preference as a gamer who hasn't even played your game yet, maybe that wouldn't fit with your concept at all, idk.\n\nAnyway, reading the description, the game sounds amazing, but just a look at the trailer without sound (dont have my headphones rn) just doesn't sell the game the way the striking reviews and actual description does. \n\nI find it a bit hard to tell hiw difficult the game is (maybe you can select difficulty? I guess I'll find out), I'd consider buying this for my tiniest brother because there is no violence in this game, just cool challenges, but I'm not sure if the game will be too difficult for him. It's also a game I might gift to my grandma, but idk if it'd be too fast paced for her. I'd definitely play it myself though because it looks very fun and I love character interactions, cute mice, the feeling of everyday spaces as being big and adventurous and ofc,  the thought of a unique game, lovingly crafted for more than 7 years. I love metroidvanias and if the game really has very challenging aspects, levels or settings, I'd share it with my friend who loves figuring out super challenging games. I'd buy the game for 14,99€ for a friend or family member and for like 6-8€ on discount for myself (I feel less guilty for spending so much money on so many games when I buy them as a gift for someone else). If I got the game now and it was indeed as fun as I expect, I'd also pay the current full price for others. But without checking for myself first, I'd be hesitant to buy. \n\nAnyway, I'm no marketing expert, I can't give any professional advice, just my initial thoughts upon a glimpse of the steam page.",

I love randomizers like Ocarina of Time, but part of the fun of that is getting to go to exciting (or dreaded) locations based on the items you get. \n\nFor example, if I get the hook shot I can check the forest temple. In your game if I get the magnet grapple I can get... Up onto those lamps, I guess. I just didn't get that same excitement from a new item, you know? Even the gourmet medal just gives a shortcut into the dining room, not access to it. Maybe the demo is just too small to make it feel adventurous, but I'm just not enticed.\n\nAlso, there aren't any upgrade sort of checks. I'm talking missile packs or energy tanks in a Super Metroid randomizer. Stuff that pads it out. You aren't mad to get extra health or ammo, it makes the rest of the game easier after all, but it isn't exciting. But those little checks that don't matter much make it so much more exciting when you hit the morph ball, or the wave beam. I don't see how a non-combat game can replicate that if I'm honest. \n\nOverall I was promised a Metroidvania with a built-in randomizer. I guess I got that, but none of the presents ever felt really rewarding. And it wasn't promising enough to drop $18.",

And I have the feeling (sorry didn’t do my research yet) that also the visuals would more fit for another platforms. I think consoles would be better fit for your game. \n2) Expectation to Steam platform and game sales. Of course there are a lot of games which sell ten thousands of copies per month, BUT there are even much much much more games which didn’t do it. Hard thing is to realize that there are also good games which complete failed in the market.\nEspecially if considering releasing only on Steam, because Steam is “only” a part of the market.\n\nSo my first impression is that releasing the game on consoles and not only on Steam would lead to better results.",

And looking at the amount of reviews you've got on your store page - it's a decent result!\n\nNow, some thoughts. As many people already pointed out - your price is too high. I see that you're working with a publisher, I'm a bit surprised they let you release at that price tag. 17,99 is not something I'd pay for a cute indie game from a no-name dev.\n\nHave you considered tapping into communities of fans of wholesome / cozy-leaning games? Your art style seems like it would make a great fit, though the game is not exactly cozy. You might want to look into streamers and game events with that in mind, too. Your art style is your main marketing resource here, not your genre, in my opinion.\n\nYour game looks lovely - show it off more in your marketing! Maybe try more visual-focused social platforms? Consider reviving your TikTok - short video format is great for that. Maybe Insta? It can seem intimidating, but do check what successful indie devs are doing for inspo, and start making videos of your own game in similar styles.\n\nThat's all that came to mind right away. I hope it helps!",

I think it’s better to sell emotions and player fantasy instead of doing \"My game is a mix of X, Y, and Z.\" but opinions on this vary.\n\nDid you do marketing? Like sending keys to streamers and YT-people in your niche? Post in targeted subreddits like r/metroidvania? Shorts on Insta, TikTok etc.? Because I never heard of your game. If you developed this over 7 years, you ideally should've started doing the above a few years in. I've read in another comment that you posted like 10 shorts but they never took off, so you gave up. That amount is way too little and it's normal that they perform poorly at first. Unless you get very lucky you have to literally spam these over months/years until things keep sticking and your numbers will grow.\n\nAlso take a look at the reviews, there is often wisdom to be found.",

In general, your pricing is a bit steep - perhaps a lower MSRP subsidised by affordable cosmetic DLC is the answer; players will buy it if it’s worth it, or to support games they love.\n\nA possible mode to add would be a ghost-multiplayer system, which allows you to connect with others to race to finish ASAP with your own unique randomised outcomes.\n\nLong term, you could create a framework allowing players to create their own levels with a dedicated level editor and custom level browser; allowing users to create the content for you.

Either the price or how the trailer explains the game, etc.\n\nIf I was you, considering you spent all this time on the game, I would try by going for some paid avertising.  \nChange your trailer and show it around and go through a couple of versions until something gets some organic movement and try publicizing that. \n\nIf that doesn't transalte to wishlists maybe then there are other issues like pricing or not appealing to a specific market properly?

But yeah, unless there's more representation of disguise jokes and race, sexual diversity it's just bigot joke tradition and I'd expect a terrorist Arab with bombs too in the game",

And it's like somebody took the warp tool on it since the sides don't seem to be evenly-matched.\n* The bottom-right one has weird extra shading on its right side and for some reason the top dot is much bigger than the ones on the other side, when in the background d6 one they're consistent.\n* The lighting across the board is inconsistent unless the hand is supposed to be the light source which doesn't seem to be working for me. It would still be uneven, look at the d20 where 6 is darker than 20 despite facing the hand.\n* Some dice are curved, you could argue it's to show motion but some of them aren't\n* There's artifacting everywhere, that may just be from the repost and not in the OG image but check it out. Why is bottom-right yellowish and top-left green for some reason?\n* Also wtf are those circle-tool eyes? It's clear the hand was made first and those added on top of it rather than part of it\n\nI don't want to point fingers at AI but how did you find your artist? And how much did they charge?\n\nAlso both still tell me nothing about the game besides there being dice involved, which isn't much of a pull when I have 10 CRPGs in my account with them",

That's when I feel like I'm wasting my time and they deserve a bad rating.\n\nNow, as a developer, I'm lucky to have players who take the time to report bugs when they encounter them. Why? Probably because they encounter bugs after several hours of play. Not right from the start, nor all the time. And it makes a big difference between encountering a bug (major or minor) after enjoying the game or right from the start and in abundance.\n\nSure, there are players who go overboard, like everywhere else.

Suddenly thousands of players try your game, and if you’re still updating the game then (which many players also expect) then there’s going to be more bugs getting introduced.\n\nThere’s such a disconnect between players and developers. Games are one of the best value forms of entertainment and some players treat devs like servants, holding them hostage with negative reviews. We just had a player demand a nerf for an enemy which has a strong attack in a negative review, this enemy only appears after completing the game. It’s so obnoxious and entitled to behave this way. We are always open to feedback when delivered kindly.\n\nI really appreciate the players who do file bug reports and give feedback in good faith.",

          "text": "I think this is a blurrier line than people admit. Even large studios with full QA teams and significant budgets still ship games with bugs. So expecting indie developers - who often don’t have dedicated testers - to release perfectly polished games feels unrealistic. That said, I do think we’re seeing this problem more often than we should.\n\nBugs absolutely matter. Players paid for the game and they’re entitled to a functional experience. But it’s also true that no developer can catch everything before launch. Where I think the bigger issue lies is in how expectations shift depending on the business model.\n\nWith free-to-play games, players are often far more forgiving of bugs because “it’s free”. Yet many of those same players have spent money on microtransactions. They’ve invested financially but still give the game a pass. I’ve seen this happen a lot. As a result, we end up with a market flooded by “free” games that are low quality but financially successful, while smaller paid titles are scrutinised much more harshly.\n\nPart of the problem is that review systems don’t clearly distinguish between “this game is fundamentally bad” and “this game has a fixable bug”. If platforms like Steam added a bug reporting feature that was just as visible and easy to use as the review button - maybe even right next to it - we’d likely see fewer reactionary negative reviews. Ideally, bug reports could even be reflected separately in a game’s profile, such as showing:  \n  \nUser Review: Positive  \nCurrent Stability - Minor issues reported\n\nOr something to that effect, so players have context without tanking the overall rating.\n\nThat kind of system could encourage constructive feedback instead of punishment and better support developers who are genuinely trying to improve their games. I also think it would help if players who report a bug that later gets fixed received some small reward as recognition for contributing. It could be something simple - a badge or whatever. But it would frame bug reporting as a positive community effort rather than something that just drags down an otherwise enjoyable game.\n\nI think leaving a review should involve a bit more scrutiny. If someone is going to post a negative review about a specific issue, they should have to go through a simple process to clarify what the actual problem is. It doesn’t seem right that someone can leave a review that just says “Couldn’t play the game” with no context. That could mean anything - a bug, unsupported hardware or something as simple as not having a mouse and keyboard.\n\nIf reviews had some basic structure - for example requiring the reviewer to select categories like performance, controls, crashes or compatibility - it would make the feedback more useful for both developers and players. It would also help separate genuine technical issues from personal setup problems, rather than letting vague one-line complaints disproportionately affect a game’s rating.\n\nI think even a star rating system would be useful, specifically one that breaks reviews down into core components of a game such as stability and performance, controls, responsiveness, gameplay, mechanics, story, writing, graphics etc.\n\nI just think a thumbs up and a thumbs down is just too basic of a rating system for something so complex, especially where serious time and money is involved.  But that's just me.",

Even then, reporting bug directly through official channel is the best way to get a bug fixed in my experience, because it really puts the bug in front of the dev, unlike the Steam comments and other social media outlets, which have much more intermittent and fragmented visibility to devs. \n\n\nFor example, Sabotage Studio fixed a bug that persisted for 2 years, 1.5 months after I sent the official report to the support mail address on their web site, even though the bug was already mentioned by other players in Steam and a Reddit post a year *before* my message.\n\n\nEdit: Another great example is WayForward, who has not become aware of a bug in the game in the 5.5 years after its release until I sent a proper bug report to their official support channel, even though a Reddit post in the game's sub and a forum post were already written by other players not too long after the release.\n\nTL; DR: \"Reporting the bug\" is a *much* more powerful and better option for players both to get bugs fixed and to provide useful feedback to devs, than it may seem at first glance.",

(They should still have told you, but I'm playing devil's advocate). \n\nI would say for commissioned art its good to get regular updates, not just so you know they're legit, but more importantly you can help evolve the design.

My style is more cute and colorful and might not match with your needs. but if you really like the current logo but just wished it wasn't AI, my advice would be to have another artist give it a human touch by just tracing over it and fixing the weird perspectives, digital artifacts and fix it so its it all feels like a coherent image and not a bunch of large creatures standing over a burning city. That's likely what I would do if I were asked but I'm sure a better artist could provide you a better piece. I would just search and make sure that the artist disclaims that they're against AI art. Many are, so I'd think there would be a market unless this person scammed you by masquerading as a \"no AI\" artist. \n\nOther than that, I don't really have any personal recommendations unfortunately. \n\n",

I'm all for asymmetry but this is just a nonsensical design choice.\n\n\nThen of course there's the two different bracers, which also don't really make sense from a design choice. It looks like three lanyards held to the main piece with rivets...?\n\n\nThe fact that the details of all the aforementioned parts kind of just seem to blend and melt into each other is usually a big tell for me. The devil is always in the details. Any artist that has studied how to draw leather armor would not make such bizarre and almost Lovecraftian design choices.",

          "text": "Here's some tips for commissioning art:\n\n1) Usually, an artist will have specifics for how much things will cost based on effort. For example: line art vs full color vs full color + shading. If someone offering commissions just offers a price without asking specifics and there isn't a pre-negotiated deal (things the artist has already offered usually, like a Your Character Here or an Adoptable) you're probably not dealing with an artist.\n\n2) Most artists usually wait for you to come to them rather than the other way around. This isn't always the case, but usually they post commission details on their socials and then wait for people to contact them. So, it's good to be wary about someone coming to you for a commission. An AI grifter can't do the social media post method because they'd get laughed off of the platform for being AI.\n\n3) It's always a good idea to look at previous works of an artist before commissioning them. This is usually fairly easy to do once you have their username as most artists will post their work online. If someone has no online gallery, that's a red flag, but not guaranteed to be a grifter.\n\n4) When you do get sample art from the commissioned artist, reverse Google search them. If you can find those pieces from clearly different artists, that means the person is probably lying about it being theirs and have stolen them to manipulate you into commissioning them. I'm in a circle of twitch-streamer friends and it's fairly common for someone to offer to do your twitch graphics and show you samples of other people's work.\n\nHope this helps!",

The windows, rooftops, and the oddness of where the stack of houses begin where the brick castle wall ends. I find AI does a lot of impossible repetitiveness of shapes, and while it's a bit more subtle here, it's still odd architecture.\n* The crow has a sort of strange appendage behind its righthand claw. Not sure if this is supposed to be a tail feather or  if it's an error, repeating the claw shape? \n* The clouds and sky have a lot of repetition in them - though as someone who uses hand-made stamp brushes (where you hand-draw something and turn it into a repetitive stamp brush), I...wouldn't necessarily mind this, if they'd blended different parts out. \n* Lastly, some of the line work on the figures is off: the center buckle where the straps crisscross on the giant's chest looks a bit melty. And some of the outerlining on each figure stops at points where it doesn't quite make sense. I don't mind imperfections in hand drawn art, but these more look like unfinished renderings.\n\n  \nYou could try to ask this person for edits, but it might be best to get a real artist to either correct or just redo this entirely. The redo would obviously be more expensive, and if you've already sunk money into this, then obviously that's up to your budget. \n\nAs someone who has done cover work for authors and game-related art, I give clients tons of sketches upfront and lots of updates as I go along. Make sure you stipulate how many sketches/status updates you want to see of the process. Most artists are already doing this when creating any piece and it shouldn't be too big of an ask. ",

If you actually look at the linework, it’s consistent and deliberate—not that weird, melted-plastic look you get with generative models.\n\nHere’s why this is obviously hand-painted:\n\nAnatomy and Proportion: Notice the giant’s hands and the raven’s talons. AI consistently struggles with complex articulation, but here the grip and the tension in the knuckles are anatomically perfect. The weight of the fur mantle also sits naturally on the shoulders, showing an understanding of physics that a prompt-box just doesn't have.\n\nThe Architecture: Look at the village below. The windows aren't melting into the walls, and the shingles on the rooftops follow a logical, perspective-accurate grid. AI usually hallucinates those details into a blurry mess, but these are sharp, distinct assets.\n\nCompositional Intent: The way the smoke leads your eye from the burning village up to the raven is a classic professional design choice. It’s a \"Z-pattern\" layout meant to guide the viewer’s gaze.\n\nThe Text: The \"GIANTFALL\" logo is perfectly integrated with a custom texture overlay. AI text still looks like a fever dream most of the time, and it certainly wouldn't handle the kerning and distressed \"chalk\" effect this cleanly.\n\nIt’s getting exhausting that \"good digital art\" now automatically means \"AI\" to some people. This is just high-quality 2D digital illustration. Give the artist some credit.\n\nWould you like me to help you draft a more formal breakdown of these artistic techniques for a different platform?",

Why don't you require him some sketches or WIP state? I think people just want to test if they can be caught using AI. ",

Even if the character has a bold outline, right around them the background will sharply lighten by several shades, giving the appearance that they're surrounded by light.",

Artists can't just join randomly; they need to get a code from someone who's already on the platform or win one of their monthly contests. There, you can also see their portfolio, their reviews and any verified commissions that they have already done. No platform is 100% foolproof but if you end up getting scammed you can contact VGen since it's done through their platform (as opposed to random DMs somewhere, where you have no protection at all).\n\n  \nAnd always make sure that the artist you commission has some sort of track-record / online portfolio (can be twitter/instagram/bluesky) that is ideally a few years old and shows a semi-consistent style as well as little sketches and doodles.",

If something feels AI to you, then high chance it is. Check also for portfolios and what other stuff they have made. Look for their art before GPT was even a thing to be extra safe. Lastly, do not pay upfront. Always ask for the process, even if that may seem annoying, but you have to be safe these days.

But his eyeline makes no sense. Is the crow a giant crow? Or is it close to camera? An actual artist would think about these things, not to mention all the architectural issues that others have pointed out.

I guess you live and learn and if so many people didn't say it was AI immediately I wouldn't have been so upset. \n\nAnyway thanks for the information and offers of help but I am where I am.

Some no-name outlet found on the third page of a Google search found my game and called it \"Shin Megami Tensei meets American horror lit' and called it his favorite game of Next Fest last year, then he saw my AI disclosure and immediately had a meltdown about it on Bluesky.\n\nEither way, for me, it's a tool like any other, and if it wasn't for it, my game either wouldn't be getting made, or it would take 7 years instead of 2.\n\nIt's not a good look when the people who fought for years to tear down the gates so enthusiastically become the new gatekeepers.\n\nFor those of you who read all this and are still with me, use whatever you want to make your game, the people trashing it were never gonna buy it to begin with.",

AI recognizes patterns better than I can. A calculator does better math than I can. A translator understands other languages better than I can. AI understands code better than I do.

No. But I would not have an issue in doing so if I believe it is needed. Why? Because it is a tool. I've read many arguments against AI, but not a single one has convinced me that I shouldn't. They really are not solid arguments... they are always lacking in one way or another, completely counterable.\n\nAI itself is not good or bad, but the method or intent of use.

I don't mind if it has \"developer art\" because I know every little detail was obsessed over and made carefully by hand to craft their dream into reality. \n\nI honestly don't care what someone does to make things as long as they are honest about it.  I just don't think you can be upset with your players for caring about something strongly.

              "text": "Artists have never been able to \"tear down the gates\", they have always been undermined, and even more so with genAI making their work look even less valuable than it is. Art is a wide scope but usually reduced to \"nice to look at\" with no regards to the people who made it or how.\n\nIf your argument to that is making art is more accessible now, you'd have to call yourself an artist then, which I'd disagree with. I doubt you'd say a script kiddie is in the same leagues as a legitimate hacker for example. If you're saying it's a tool that artists can use to make their work easier, I think you need to be an artist to make that determination and personally, I haven't seen many artists who made the case where genAI has actually helped their workflow or create a better end product. Many people like you have said \"it's just a tool, use it\" but a lot of artists have actually tried, and it just proved again and again it's not something they can use effectively, much less ever meant for them. Like you said, AI is oversold, it's terrible on its own. When Larian said that when they tried their hand at using it in the creative process and admitted it didn't help in efficiency, how can you say it's a tool people need to adapt to, to not fall behind?\n\nUsing genAI is essentially saying there's no need for artists at all despite everything around you in your daily life is made by someone with at least some artistic skill and thought. You may see it as smaller snippets of your project, but you admitted you used genAI specifically in attempt to match the theme you want, it's an element that helps concrete the identity of your game. It's contradictory to say certain visuals mean so little, when you put up importance in trying to achieve a cohesive and interesting looking game. People aren't going to respect the amount of time, skill and work you put into your project when you can't respect the same that other creatives put into theirs.\n\nI understand there's frustration in that you see it as a sorts of last resort without spending 3x (or more) time and a lot of money, but that is sort of par of the course of a big project with multiple facets such as a video game. Regardless of how you see image assets as something you can just use a \"tool\" to come up with, I'm going to tell you it doesn't and won't help the visual look of your game and potentially look worse than fetching already-made assets that are available. You can argue that's not the case, and yeah that's just my opinion, but AI barely gets basic prompts right and difficult to direct properly unless its the barest of things, why people then say it can create entire images that match what you imagined and that it looks cohesive and distinct enough to stand out, is beyond me.\n\nI'd say there are other ways to make original assets without spending years how to draw or having to spend a great deal of money but you clearly don't want to go those routes. Besides that, I think it's disingenuous to make the claim there's no way you can afford a couple of paid assets or an artist to make something unique for you when you're likely spending however much to generate hundreds of images and picking out a handful of useable ones. I imagine it's cheap, sure, but claiming you have zero budget...?",

              "text": "Majority of people against AI are for one of three reasons:\n\n1) AI art - majority of AI models were trained on art without giving credit or compensation to the artists, and without asking for their permission. Many people hate the use of AI art because of this. Another side of why some people hate AI art is that people want AI that can prep their taxes and do math for them, so they can focus on things they like, such as art. They don't want an AI that can do the fun things (art), so they can focus on their job more. AI creating art while people are stuck doing monotonous things seems backwards to many people.\n\n2) AI slop - a lot of people think AI produces shit work. Now, this is true, but the amount it's improved in just a few years is astonishing. I use it daily to form SQL statements so I don't have to waste \\~10 trying to piece together my data. I trained a chatgpt instance a single time, and I go to that instance every time I want to ask a question about my database, and it remembers how all the pieces connect and spits my out my statement in a few seconds. It is rarely wrong when it comes to something simple like that and it saves me a couple hours a week.\n\n3) AI vaccuum - research is already showing loss of critical thinking & creativity skills because AI can do it for us. Why even bother googling something and trying to find an article to see what something is talking about when I can prompt AI, read what it says, and go on with my day? I remember in one of my first \"big boy\" jobs I spent almost an entire week designing and implementing a complex spreadsheet filled with VBA macros that helped a CPA firm take their invoicing process paperless. I had to dive into Excel macros the other day again, and I was able to whip up a pretty complex spreadsheet in an hour. I just told the AI what I wanted to do, how my data was displayed, and then had to tweak a bit. I used none of my programming or design skills. No critical thinking at all. How long until we're riding around on floating chairs, unable to walk because our bones are too fragile, drinking muffin-in-a-cups every day?",

You're talking about art, but art it not just about the craft; it's primarily about the vision, the message, the emotions it evokes. I write stories, design worlds, and I know how deeply I can touch other people emotionally with them. With AI, I can visualize this vision and strengthen it further; the human connection isn't lost in the process, it's enhanced. Behind the AI and it's prompting  ​​is a human being, anyone who doesn't understand that doesn't understand how AI really works.\n\nI also don't want to play AI slop, nor asset-flipped games, or soulless mass-produced games with micro-transactions. But if a game comes out that's truly excellent, manages to move me emotionally, and is simply fun – then I want to play it - even when its made with AI. I don't care HOW it was made.\n\n",

Doesn't matter if AI understands the story, more importantly how we see it, and if we can find something in this story or not.\nI mean, we all see games and other things like entertainment (as consumers). If you need to express yourself and put emotions on paper, AI can't stop you from it. You still can do it. \nAt the end, if you want to express yourself, this is the main goal.

I'm using that as a template to recreate it in Unity. \n\n\nI also use it to assist in coding, whether it's boilerplate code, simple functions, something requiring niche knowledge, or something that's hard to wrap my head around. \n\n\nI ask AI for help when I want to brainstorm ideas for mechanics and narrative when I get writer's block. Sure, as an example, I could spend an hour coming up with the perfect acronym for some in-game plot device, using a thesaurus for synonyms, or I could ask the LLM to fill in this acronym with a certain theme attached to it and it's done instantly, giving me however many combinations of the acronym I want. After all, there are only 400,000 words in English, there is no true unique way to fill in the acronym. \n\n\nDo you guys really have a problem with the way I use AI?",

Kinda like how Goat Simulator icon is basically a goat. \n\n(Gonna be honest if I had a penny for everytime someone asks an artist and they overengineer the game art...)",

That said, I’ve enjoyed being able to push the quality of my assets further (I’m a game artist), since you usually have more time per asset at these kinds of companies.\n* At small companies, there are far fewer people involved in development, so you have to create a lot more assets in less time. On the flip side, I’ve enjoyed having more creative freedom and a bigger impact on the final product.\n* As a solo dev, it’s really cool to have full control over your project and be able to implement your vision it’s an absolute blast. But the obvious downside is the financial side of things. While working in big and small teams I've been able to make a living out of gamedev, I don’t think I’d be able to become a fulltimer as solo dev.",

Very bad move.\n\nSecondly, the UI of the game itself can use some work. From the text to the dialogue boxes, they can look more polished instead of being solid rectangles of green and blue, and very flat looking buttons and icons.\n\n  \nFinally, content seems to be limited. All yours screenshots have the same building in the background. Are there no other buildings in the game? If so, include them in your marketing material.\n\n  \nYou are competing with The Movies and its copycats, which all provide sets, expansive animation and an overall seamless experience. I feel if you release now, you will fall short of expectations due to the lack of depth of gameplay. A niche genre is harder to release for because its playerbase is that much critical. It feels more of a text based game with moving characters than a movie set simulator.\n\n  \nA meme is good and all, but it won't carry your release. Rethink your release date. Best of luck.\n\n  \n",

Like all information being \\[Irrelevant\\] except for the name being \"Mom\" and the image being normal, for example.\n\nAlso, just my opinions, but even as place-holders, you should use anything else before AI-generated images tbh, even just a stickman with their features (eyes, mouths, etc.) removed after each step would be plenty.
