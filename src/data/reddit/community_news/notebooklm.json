              "text": "I started with the [AWS re:Invent 2025](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2yQDdvlhXf_NqSnDKx7Hbb9FrNQKmxg7&si=h6PCmjt-m6amtEgT) YouTube playlist posted on the [AWS Events](https://www.youtube.com/@AWSEventsChannel) channel. This playlist contains most all of the sessions including the breakout sessions. After a lot of trial and error, I settled on the following process:\n\n1. I sequentially went down the AWS Events playlist and manually added each session to my own created YouTube public playlists in blocks of 30 videos per playlist.\n2. Created a NotebookLM project for each of my 30 video created playlists.\n3. Then, I used the Chrome Extensions [NotebookLM Web Importer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/notebooklm-web-importer/ijdefdijdmghafocfmmdojfghnpelnfn) and [NotebookLM - WebSync Full Site Importer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/notebooklm-websync-full-s/hjoonjdnhagnpfgifhjolheimamcafok) to import the YouTube playlists that I created into their corresponding NotebookLM projects. You only need one of these extensions. They both work equally well. I started with the Web Importer and switched to WebSync because I discovered that it saved me a few clicks.\n4. Then, I used the [Kortex ](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/kortex/hdapplggdhndkblofffknpmnnnnbncbn)extension to download each of the 30 sources as .txt files in my NotebookLM projects into its own zip file. I extracted the zip file which gave me a folder of 30 .txt files with each file being a complete transcript of its corresponding session.\n5. Then, I went to the free online service, [merge2md](https://ms-soft.jp/en/tools/merge2md/), added the unzipped folder, merged the 30 .txt files and downloaded them as one combined .txt file. The service gives you the option to download the combined file as either text or markdown. I learned that I needed to download it as text which I will explain later.\n6. Then, I created a new Google doc and opened the combined text file in the Google doc.\n7. Then, I downloaded the Google doc and chose the download option of Markdown (.md). I added the Markdown file as a source to the public [AWS re:Invent 2025 All Sessions](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/531e0eeb-8540-4fb7-abbf-bd3d11c19f1b) NotebookLM project. I repeated these steps for each of the 34 sources in the notebook.\n\nInitially, I tried extracting the 30 video NotebookLM projects as Markdown. The Kortex extension provides a choice of Markdown or text. Also, the merge2md online tool provides a choice of merging the files as either Markdown or text. However, I found that these Markdown files did not work well in NotebookLM. I tested it by asking for the transcript of a particular session and got replies that the transcript was not available even though I could clearly see it in the source. So, I changed the process and only choose the text option which did not involve the Google doc. I added the merge2md combined text file as the source to NotebookLM. When I asked for a transcript in the chat, NotebookLM accurately responded with it -- but the performance was awful. It was slow and clunky. Knowing that Markdown is the preferred format for LLMs and NotebookLM, I decided to take the merge2md combined file and use a Google product (Docs) to convert it to Markdown before feeding it to another Google product (NotebookLM). The result was better performance with snappier and more accurate (I think) responses. Now that I have a playbook, the AWS re:Invent 2026 NotebookLM project should go a lot faster and smoother.",

But the deep research feature is still far from Perplexity/Gemini in terms of depth. One workaround i've found is running a deep research in Perplexity and just copy pasting the list of sources (links) into Notebooklm's source import option. This is still imperfect because Perplexity's source list doesn't include everything in their research report. \n\nIs anyone else using Notebooklm for serious research work (where you can't afford hallucinations)?\n\n",

That's it. No cloning repos (still available of course), no manual setup, etc.\n\n**New videos for non-technical users:**  \nSome of you and some YouTube viewers mentioned that the original demo felt too developer-focused (command-line Claude code). Fair point. So I created two new walkthroughs showing how to use the MCP with AI tools that don't require coding:\n\n* [Using the MCP with Claude Desktop](https://youtu.be/PU8JhgLPxes) (works with Free subs too)\n* [Using the MCP with Perplexity Desktop](https://youtu.be/BCKlDNg-qxs)\n\nThe perplexity video was pretty cool. I tested a workflow of asking Perplexity to run a deep research and then adding it to a notebook (as pasted text) - it worked!\n\nReminder - Repo: [https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp](https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp)\n\nIf you tried it before and bounced off the setup, give it another shot. And if you're not technical but curious about automating NotebookLM workflows, the new videos should help.\n\nHappy to answer questions!",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI wanted to share a project I’ve been working on for a while.\n\nLike many of you, I love using NotebookLM, but I really wanted to integrate it into my AI coding workflows (specifically with Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex and Cursor - yes, I use all of them :). I looked at existing MCP (Model Context Protocol) solutions, but I noticed most of them rely on browser automation like Puppeteer or Selenium.\n\nIn my experience, those can be a bit heavy and prone to breaking if the UI changes.\n\nSo, I decided to try a different approach. I reverse-engineered the internal Google RPC calls to create a **NotebookLM MCP that runs entirely on HTTP requests.**\n\n**What makes it different:**\n\n* **Speed & Stability:** Since it doesn’t need to spawn a headless browser, it’s much faster and lighter on resources.\n* **Functionality:** I managed to map out about 31 different tools. You can create notebooks, upload sources, sync Google Drive files that are out of date, and even generate Audio Overviews programmatically. Warning: it will consume a nice chunk of your context window, so disable it when not in use.\n\n**How it works:** For example, you can ask your AI agent to: \"Create a new notebook about Topic X, run a deep/fast research, add all sources, and then generate a custom video, audio overviews, an infographic, and a briefing doc.\"\n\nMy most significant pain point was checking with gDrive sources that are not fresh in a Notebook; manually checking and refreshing was cumbersome - my MCP automates that.\n\nI put together a 15-minute demo video and the full source code on GitHub. It’s open-source (MIT license), and I’d love for this community to give it a spin.\n\nI am really curious to see what kind of workflows you can build with this. Let me know if you run into any bugs - it’s definitely a passion project, but I hope to maintain it (as no doubt Google will change RPCs over time).\n\n**Repo & Demo:** [**https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp**](https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ki00o9ytrkag1.jpg?width=1022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=753f25cc06d03288a9bd40df00ce47fa5328e550\n\n",

In your related video (also nicely explained), you talked about the context size issue with loading so many tools. I believe there are ways to create different “toolset groups”. So for example if you are only planning to query existing notebooks, you enable a few tools for that purpose and context token usage will be very low. If you plan to do lots of notebook administration, you enable the tools allowing creating, editing, and deleting notebooks, for example. And then you have a kitchen sink version when context isn’t an issue, which is what you have now.\n\nFor what it’s worth… from Gemini.\n\nThree Ways to Build This\n\nOption A: The \"Launcher\" (Router) Pattern\nInstead of 31 tools, you load one tool called switch_mode.\n1. The user starts in \"Base Mode\" (minimal tools).\n2. If the user says \"I need to analyze these logs,\" the model calls switch_mode(mode=\"log_analysis\").\n3. The MCP server then refreshes the tool list provided to the LLM to only include the 5 tools relevant to logs.\n\n\nOption B: The Multi-Server Approach\nMCP allows any client) to connect to multiple servers at once.\n• Server 1 (The Core): 5 essential tools always loaded.\n• Server 2 (The Data Scientist): 10 tools for math/charts.\n• Server 3 (The Researcher): 10 tools for web search/PDF reading.\nYou can create a \"Controller\" script that connects/disconnects these servers dynamically based on user selection in the UI.\n\n\nOption C: Functional Grouping (Most Efficient)\nYou rewrite the MCP server logic to categorize tools into \"Toolsets.\" When the client asks for list_tools, the server checks an environment variable or a configuration flag to decide which set to return.",

If you want to create quizzes or flashcards for a specific topic, simply check that specific source and uncheck the others. You can repeat this for each topic, renaming the generated Quizzes or flashcards to avoid confusion (to rename them, just open the note and click the title to edit).\n​You can even customize the output by giving the AI specific prompts for example, asking for 'harder questions' or 'true/false formats.'\n\n Just keep in mind that there may be usage limits depending on whether you are using the free or pro version.",

I wouldn't be surprised if the mp3 conversion would do it as well.  \n\nI haven't done what you are doing for my classes.  I generally flip it, and try to get them to use it. One thing I do, is point out that my lecture captures (Panopto) can be added via transcripts.  The slides can be added as well, plus their notes.  Use that to build out weekly study guides.  If there are key items I think they should know, I will share those via Google drive (so I can update them, and they can update the documents instead of having to delete and reupload).\n\nOne reason I do this, is that at my institution, we are VERY locked down. Only others in our domain can see our notebooks.  Since students are on a separate domain, I can't share with them.  I do know another professor was shown this functionality last summer and created audio overviews of each chapter (she wrote her book).  Her immediate, next day feedback was great.  \n\nAt the end of the last semester I used it to consolidate feedback from students on presentations. (They have to watch other presentations and give feedback on other students.)  I had them fill out a form for each group and give feedback.  I pulled that into NBLM as a Google Sheet and then had NBLM create feedback for each group's presentation.  I also had it create an infographic on that feedback.  It worked amazingly well.  I wrote up a blog post (and near the end I shared out a google drive folder with examples, so you can basically rebuild what I did easily).   \n[https://atomicego.com/ai-use-cases-tutorials/notebooklm-tidbit-automate-sentiment-analysis-from-google-forms](https://atomicego.com/ai-use-cases-tutorials/notebooklm-tidbit-automate-sentiment-analysis-from-google-forms) \n\nFor those that may complain about using AI for grading, I didn't do that.  I included my notes on the presentations, gave them a grade, and then included the overall sentiment from the students as additional feedback.",

In my chat with Gemini it ignored some key information from that Notebook.  When I specifically asked about that topic, again, it answered like it didn't know.  Then I went to the Notebook directly and asked it about this specific topic and it gave a very detailed response as I would expect.  I copied this and went back to the Gemini chat and told Gemini that I was concerned it wasn't accessing all the Notebook's info, and I pasted the Notebook's answer.  Suddenly, Gemini realizes and says, \"You are absolutely correct. The specific details regarding **t**his were not present in the initial file fragments I had access to. Thank you for providing that detailed excerpt—it fills a significant gap\".  I asked about this more and said I was concerned about it.  Why did it happen?  \"This is a completely fair question. I want to be transparent about why this happened so you can trust the process and get better results next time.  The issue likely stems from **how AI \"reads\" large files** (like a Notebook). I do not \"know\" or \"read\" the entire uploaded Notebook at once in the way a human reads a book cover-to-cover. Instead, I rely on a **retrieval process**.\"  Interesting, is there anything I could or should have done to prevent Gemini from missing this info? \n\n\"**Use \"Anchor\" Keywords:** If you suspect a specific topic exists (like a location, a person, or a date), include it.  \n\"**Ask for an Index or List First:** Before asking for details, ask for a high-level scan.\"  \n\"Ask for \"Outliers\"\"  \n  \n\"In short: **I can only \"know\" what I am successfully able to retrieve.** When asking about large files, being specific (even slightly, like asking about \"XXX\") acts as a hook that pulls the right information to the surface.\"\n\nI just thought this experience may help others.",

In-conversation: Click \\[+\\] → NotebookLM → attach for that specific chat session\n\n  2. In Gems: Attach notebook to a Gem's Knowledge Base → becomes permanent expertise for all conversations with that Gem\n\nThe Gem approach is more powerful for recurring use cases. You get Gemini's reasoning + web access + your notebook's 300 sources as grounded context. Think of it as: Gemini = brain (reasoning), NotebookLM = memory (retrieval).\n\nPro tip from experience: Combine three layers for maximum effect:\n\n  \\- NotebookLM for domain expertise (your 10 sources about the topic)\n\n  \\- Google Docs/Sheets in Gem Knowledge Base for dynamic data (updates in real-time!)\n\n  \\- \"@Google Keep\" for personal context (Gems can query Keep on-demand)\n\nOne caveat from u/New_Refuse_9041's comment above is real — Gemini uses retrieval, not full document reading. Be specific with keywords to \"hook\" the right information.\n\nI wrote a detailed breakdown of the Three-Layer Architecture and Gem integration patterns here if you want to dive deeper: [https://jsonobject.com/gemini-gems-building-your-personal-ai-expert-army-with-dynamic-knowledge-bases](https://jsonobject.com/gemini-gems-building-your-personal-ai-expert-army-with-dynamic-knowledge-bases)",

I will ask Gemini to create the character, and it does a great job although I frequently have to rename them because it pulls from a very limited database of names it seems. Then I'll update a document I keep in Google docs called \"Overview\" and then synch that with NotebookLM so it's always got the most current information. \n\nOnce I finish playing a day in the game world, I will take my raw notes and put them into NotebookLM as GAMEWORLD DATE- RAW. Then as I write the story that covers that day, I will put that into NotebookLM as GAMEWORLD DATE-STORY. I also have a source note in NotebookLM that explains what the RAW and the STORY filenames indicate. \n\nGemini also helped me create the structure of the city. I gave it the geographical information and population size and demographics. I told it I wanted 1/2 sq mile tiles, and it told me how many I would need for the various areas in the city and generally where they would be located. I'm filling the tiles in myself as we explore the city. It helped me understand what a 1/2 sq mile area would be like by comparing to my own neighborhood. That was super helpful.",

Presumably it is the same for both? In theory I could have 10 notebooks of 300 sources each accessible via Gemini 3 Pro. Usually active tokens are in the region of 100 - 300k - so well inside the context window. It's always going to give you the top 50-100 most likely chunks in response to a query   irrespective of the number of sources. So provided active tokens remain in the context window and possible chunks do not exceed 100, Gemini AI should work the same as NBLM for RAG, all other things being equal. Have I got that right? I asked NBLM how it would handle > 100 equally probable chunks to decide how it would decide what to exclude, and it struggled to explain.  My guess is that it would just keep moving along to the right of the decimal point to decide.",

Best thing about notebook LM is that it will only be restricted to your sources - so hallucination is not a possibility\n2. You first finalise - you want your own source or you have to create a bible document first?\n3. If u r a student - and are tied to a board - say CBSE - then u either stick to your book / or there’s another way - u go to Gemini - choose deep research - write a prompt to build material on that topic which is strictly CBSE based and should not be beyond that \n4. So u either go by your source (PDF book) or u have an intelligent document through deep research (if searches through all possible databases across globe)\n5. Then basis your need - u keep developing outcomes - like - I have discovered that it is best to use mind map - so u get break up of topics - then you ask notebook LM chat option also - to break the topic into meaningful sub-topics\n6. Then u play with the sub-topics in each of LM’s utility features\n7. For prompts to customize the output - don’t apply brain - just go to chat gpt / Gemini and ask it to give you a prompt basis your need and also tell it - which particular feature of notebook Lm u r using - that’s it!\n\nBest of luck with your research.",

This post is old, and I stopped using other chatboxes like ChatGPT and Perplexity, so there's a good chance that many of them now have the features listed below. The overall reason why I like notebook LM is that I can upload my own documents and sources, ask questions, and be very confident that the information being spit back to me is accurate, it's like having a personal AI that is exclusively knowledgeable about the information you feed it.\n\n\">notebookLM provides direct citations to each of its statement, allowing you to personally verify if its interpretation of the information is accurate\n\n\\>Notebook LM notifies you when they're using information outside the sources provided, so you can make judgements about the truthworthiness of the information it's providing you\n\n\\>the information notebook LM provides comes directly from your sources, for chatGPT you typically have to prompt it to do that and even then it still sometimes uses information outside of your source without notifying you which can be annoying\n\n\\>there is some level of consistency in notebook LM's answers i.e if I ask the same question to notebook LM on different days, it will spit out the exact same answers, assuming that I haven't added or removed sources, the same can't be said for chatgpt\n\n\\>it's way easier to create custom chatboxes for notebook LM in comparison with chatgpt\n\n\\>I can add up to 300 sources (with notebook LM plus) in minutes very easily, I can't do the same for chatgpt\n\n\\>notebook LM can actually transcribe audio directly once you import the audio file as a source, I'm pretty sure chatgpt can't do that\n\n\\>I can save notebook LM replies into notes and refeed it back to it as a source which increases its context window allowing it to have even more precise and nuanced answers\n\n\\>this one is my personal favourite but notebook LM is actually really good at making flashcards since it's using your notes as a source, I've tried making flashcards with chatgpt, the quality of the cards are usually pretty poor and it likes to repeat questions in a different wording a lot\"",

NotebookLM does something different: it becomes an expert only on what you upload. PDFs, YouTube videos, docs, whatever. Every answer includes inline citations you can click to verify against the original source.\n\nFor your Data Engineering learning path specifically:\n\n  \\- Upload AWS/GCP docs, YouTube tutorials, textbooks → ask it to explain concepts\n\n  \\- Generate Audio Overviews (podcast-style explanations) to listen while commuting\n\n  \\- It won't hallucinate random answers from the internet because it only uses your sources\n\nThe Audio/Video Overview feature is honestly what makes it unique — no competitor does this. It creates natural podcast conversations from your sources, complete with hosts debating and explaining concepts.\n\nSince you already have Google AI Pro, you have NotebookLM Plus included — 500 notebooks, 300 sources each, 20 Audio Overviews/day.\n\nQuick tip: try uploading a Data Engineering course video or PDF you're studying, then ask it to generate a podcast. You'll immediately see the difference.\n\nI wrote up a detailed breakdown of all the features and use cases here if you want more context: [https://jsonobject.com/notebooklm-googles-accidental-masterpiece-rewriting-how-we-learn](https://jsonobject.com/notebooklm-googles-accidental-masterpiece-rewriting-how-we-learn)",

I like the authentic answers on Reddit. And for lack of better words, it just feels better using it. Also, I think you know as well as I do that something like 60% of all the data for these LLMs comes from Reddit anyway. That is the main reason I just switched to using Reddit for the most part. \n\nThere are still times when I will use ChatGPT. For instance, today, when I was out getting paint, I had a few questions about the finish on the paint. Meaning glossy vs flat vs matte. I find that taking pictures and giving it to ChatGPT are extremely useful for items like that. But yeah, I am like you. Why not just ask fellow redditors about other things, especially when it comes to diet, health, and questions along those lines?",

I was also expecting this to become a feature that would be released in Notebook LM, including the functionality to add structure with directories and subdirectories in a notebook where you can have between 300 and 600 sources. That still seems to be on the agenda. That would've been relevant, but now that you can simply combine notebooks in Gemini, you just need to create multiple notebooks with different smaller topics. Maybe that even makes them more performant. Either way, it's a way to make Gemini more attractive again by combining the capabilities of Notebook LM with the more powerful models of Gemini and the combination of notebooks.",

Feels lively, but no added depth.\n\nExample: Upload a paper on “cognitive load theory” and the podcast says “oh, this is interesting!” “yeah, working memory is limited!” “we should be mindful at work!”\n\nBut I still can’t answer: What are the three types of cognitive load? How does it differ from other theories? What are real applications? The podcast skips all the deeper questions.\n\n2️⃣Learning is like peeling an onion 🧅\n\nThis month taught me: learning goes from shallow to deep.\n\nFirst layer: Quick overview - podcasts work here (10 min and I get the gist)\n\nSecond layer: Key points - First listen takes 20 min, second another 20, third is just repetition. After an hour, I’m still stuck at surface level.\n\nPeople say NotebookLM is great for “casual listening.” I thought so too 🤔, but now I realize:\n\nSurface content: one listen is enough Deep content: listening alone doesn’t cut it - need notes, diagrams, practice\n\nSo “casual listening while studying” is actually pretty niche",

Then ask notebook LM in chat to create contents / divide the entire research into different sub-topics.

I was like - if you don’t ask the podcast to be concentrated - it will decide the priority of discussion on it’s own - because it has not specific instruction / context from you.

      "text": "I’m new to NBLM, so forgive this elementary question: Are any of you using it as a sort of “super-filing system” for old work you want to keep handy for research and referencing?\n\nLet me be specific: I’m a retired journalist. I have thousands of pieces I’ve written, several books, and probably a thousand file folders (stretching back to my Osborne I) of research on things I’ve written. They’re scattered in different places - files within files within files. I often find myself Googling my own work because I can’t locate something in my own nested files. \n\nI’m thinking it might be a good idea to create Notebooks for some of the broader subjects I’ve covered - things like “History of the U.S. Senate” and “Television History” - and just drop files in there when I encounter them.  Almost like creating sets of useful database from my otherwise random files. Does this make sense? Any suggestions for doing this the right way?",

It should do a pretty good job at scanning your docs and pulling the best recommendations, though I’m unsure how well it’ll work with large amounts of files. \n\nNote though that this feature only works with a limited amount of file types. .docx, .txt, maybe .pdf? If you have file types different than that, you’ll have to figure out how to batch convert them first.\n\nDM me if you need help.",

Then on the different types of content or timeframes we ran the same custom prompts to get a consistent analysis/synthesis.

Refinement of messaging and teaching material is a lost art, IMO. \n\nThe quality of prompting questions is critical, and I encourage people to critique/refine/optimize effective results. Then head to the studio for assessment and resource generation. I absolutely use the mindmap early and often to make sure I am hitting both high-level concepts and gory detail as necessary. Finally, resolving the content to a specific demographic or audience is powerful. This is one of the few platforms that doesn't hallucinate often, but you do need to make it fact-check sources.\n\nThat said, bias, I love the workflow and the power of NotebookLM.

Worse is that NBLM will now often ignore my instructions unless I am very explicit and repeat multiple times in the prompt. Just had an audio generation wasted on another output where my prompt instructions were ignored and it just gave a general overview.",
