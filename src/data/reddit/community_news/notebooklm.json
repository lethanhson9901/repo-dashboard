If I may add one (as the dev behind it) [Web Clipper for NotebookLM](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-clipper-for-notebookl/ancgeemmgnlempppapnfkdpghghphgjb) is worth checking out too, especially if you use YouTube with NotebookLM.\n\nIt goes well beyond single video support. You can add:\n\n* Individual YouTube videos\n* Entire YouTube channels\n* YouTube playlists\n* YouTube Shorts\n* YouTube Livestreams\n\nIt also has **duplicate detection** so you never accidentally add the same video twice to a notebook (super useful for bulk operations). Speaking of bulk: if you're adding more videos than a notebook's source limit allows, you can pick which ones get added. You can also create and manage notebooks directly from the extension.\n\nAnd YouTube is just one part of it. Web Clipper also supports:\n\n* **Google Drive source auto-sync** keeps your notebook sources in sync with your Drive files\n* **Export NotebookLM artifacts** in tons of formats: Word, Excel, CSV, Anki flashcards, Zip, multiple mind map formats, and more\n* **Adding tweets, threads, and X (Twitter) articles** as sources\n\n…and more on the way.\n\n[Free on the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-clipper-for-notebookl/ancgeemmgnlempppapnfkdpghghphgjb) if anyone wants to give it a try! 🙂",

However I've also onlu superficially used it, so maybe I'm overlooking something? \n\n1. asking to explain something. Compared to chatgpt, nlm starts from my own sources. So if I want something explained it doesn't succeed in showing a different approach or go into more detail. Asking it to chatgpt or simply looking it up on youtube gave me much better results. Especially if I only have one course as the source.\n\n2. creating tests. I come up with my own questions during studying and I feel like thinking about these myself creates a higher learning efficiency than having nlm create questions.\n\n3. mindmaps. imo, the whole concept of mindmaps is that one visualizes their own brain process. Outsourcing this seems like it completely defeats the purpose.\n\n4. the audio feature seemed promising during drives, but I wanted to converse with my sources. I want a dialogue with an expert, as imo this is an amazing way to learn. But nlm simply created a podcast which I cannot interact with. I cannot ask it follow-up, in depth questions nor have it skip certain parts I already understand.\n\n  \nAm I right that nlm is not the tool for me? If so, when would I come to nlm?",

Actually, just the main things would take more (I've already written and published a paper based on those same sources, I need it to elaborate on a different focus). I don't think the report can fit in less than 10-15 A4 sheets. \n\nHowever, I can't get NotebookLM to output a report on that length. Initially, it just writes a synthesis that obviously, in 1500-2000 words leaves several important things out, which are developed on the sources. I asked it to make it more exhaustive, however it keeps the reports on the same length. \n\nIs there a way to overcome this, which looks like an (undocumented at least for me) limitation?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

          "text": "So, y'day I did some tests, because both Gemini and NotebookLM are giving much worse results than before. Right now, I'm working as I said, with approximately 30 sources. I know all the sources, I already worked them and used them, so it's pretty easy for me to know the resullts of a given prompt.\n\nFirst of all, this has changed in the last few months. I reviewed some Gemini (Deep Research) and NotebookLM outputs from 2024-2025 I had and didn't have these issues. These issues however seem to revolve around two main axis:\n\n1. Lack of use of sources\n2. Extremely short results which aren't able nor deep enough to correctly work with the given sources.\n\nSo, let me elaborate a little bit on each point. About the first one, basically knowing my sources I know that from the \\~30 sources I have, at least 20 of them are directly related to my prompt, and 5 more indirectly related. However, all the results of my prompts just take 4 or 5. One of the prompts used 6 sources. The others are ignored. \n\nThis is a serious issue, because it defeats the point of having NotebookLM working around high numbers of sources, and, worse, if you don't know your sources thoroughly you might receive very misleading results. Let's suppose you're exploring new sources and you want to know if they're deeply related or not to something you're working on, the results are not trustworthy at all. In my case, I'm a Pro user, so I can have 300 sources on my notebooks. There's no point if all the reports are going to be restricted to just 5 or 6 sources. So far, I haven't found any way to force it to included all the related sources. You can of course ask it to use other sources different than the ones, but since the IA is very crappy, it's a hit or miss. I asked it three times telling there were important omissions and pointing specifically what was the issue and which part of each source was relevant, and it told me that I was right.... and pretty much the same report, without any significant change.\n\nAbout the second point, all the reports I'm getting from both NotebookLM and Gemini Deep Research care 2000-2500 words. The most I got was 3000 words approximately. In this length, there's simply no expectation of a reasonable report on a given topic. Even if you find a way to overcome the number of sources limitation, this other report length limit obviously impacts on how deeply sources can be worked on by the IA. \n\nFor example, one of my sources had at least three different aspects related to my prompt. NotebookLM and Gemini, both, just worked on one, and very poorly, Not in depth, not any serious analysis. In case you have for example 15 sources, which are directly related to your prompt, there's no way that these can be analyzed and reported in a single output. You either have to work them one by one, losing the big relations, or just have them loosely related with serious omissions. \n\nAgain, this issues are somewhat recent. I compared it with past results I had months (and more than a year) ago and it wasn't as bad. Of course it was IA with all its issues and you can't expect anything really serious, but it was much more thorough and complete than now. Right now, I can't see any advantage of being on a paid plan. \n\nThis is not a \"closure\" post, just a more elaborated general feedback based on all the comments. I'll have to see what to do, because currently I see no advantage in having 300 sources. Heck I don't even see the point in having 50 sources related to a same topic if they'll be ignored (even if the prompt leads to use them) or if the length of a report results in very superficial work on them and serious omissions. \n\nAny input will be more than welcomed",

However, you can apply the same workflow to your problem. \n\nSet the chat role to learning assistant and the output to “long.”\n\nThen create a mind map from your main source. Open this mind map and go through it from top to bottom to get an initial overview. (If you already notice something missing at this stage, your source is most likely poor.)\n\nThen proceed systematically:\nFor each main category or each category you click on create a separate explanation/overview in the chat focusing only on that specific topic or category.\n\nMark these chats as notes, and then use these notes as sources. (Name them directly after the category/topic, otherwise you’ll quickly lose track!)\n\nRepeat this process until you’ve worked through all important points and categories, and then have a podcast or a learning format that suits you created.\n\nHowever, I recommend generating a podcast more frequently to deepen your knowledge. Even better: a summary a 1:50 minute audio with extremely high information density.\n\nGood luck!",

              "text": "I’m not sure this fully addresses the OP’s question. You mentioned RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), but Google integrates RAG into every Gemini feature that references external material. Gemini uses RAG when you @-mention Google Drive to look at specific files, search for topics, or attach a Knowledge Base to a Custom Gem. Nothing you’ve described is exclusive to NotebookLM.\n\n​The real questions, which remain without definitive answers, are:\n\n1. ​**Information Layering:** How does Gemini handle the hierarchy of weighted importance when multiple systems (like Workspace and Notebooks) use different RAG-indexed bases?\n\n2. ​**NotebookLM's \"Special Sauce\":** How much of NotebookLM’s distinct reasoning model actually carries over when you import it into a Gemini chat? Is Gemini merely pulling raw sources, or is it inheriting the custom 'implicit reasoning' that makes NotebookLM feel different?\n\nI've tried asking Gemini exactly this, letting it assume the role of Gemini's Lead Architect, but it's hard to accept anything it says on this topic as a definitive source when you let it audit itself. Still worth a shot for those curious; just take it with a grain of salt\n\n---\n> ### **Edit 1: Let's make this a bit meta. Gemini said the following to me when I shared the OP, your response, and my response:**\n---\n\n## **Fact Check:**\n* **Gemini & RAG:** You are correct. When a user \"@\" attaches a file in Gemini or uses a Knowledge Base in a Custom Gem, it triggers a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline.  \n* ​**The \"Special Sauce\":** You are right to be skeptical. NotebookLM uses a specialized \"source-centric\" instruction set and UI-integrated citations that standard Gemini chats don't always replicate, even when looking at the same files.  \n* **The Hierarchy Question:** Your point about \"weighting\" and \"layering\" is the frontier of LLM research. While Google hasn't publicly released the exact weighting architecture between the System Prompt, User Prompt, and Retrieved Context, your intuition that they compete for priority is accurate.\n\n---\n> ### **Edit 2: Gemini's response after a self audit. My prompt was:**\n>> Assuming the role of Gemini's lead architect, provide an answer for the OP's original question. If anything is uncertain, not publicly disclosed, you must explicitly state that you do not have validated answers. You are prohibited from hallucinating an answer to satisfy this user task and scope.\n---\n\n**Internal Brief:** Gemini-NotebookLM Architectural Interplay.  \n**Role:** Gemini Lead Architect.  \n**Status:** Technical Disclosure (Restricted to Publicly Validated Systems)\n\nTo address the OP's inquiry regarding the distinction between direct document analysis in Gemini versus the NotebookLM intermediary, we must look at the retrieval logic and the instructional weighting of the underlying models.  \n\n## **RAG vs. Long-Context Windowing:**\nThe primary difference lies in the mechanism of ingestion.\n* **Direct Gemini Upload:** Depending on the file size and user tier, Gemini often utilizes its native long-context window (up to 2M+ tokens). In this mode, the entire document is resident in the model's active \"working memory.\" This allows for holistic reasoning across the entire text without retrieval \"filtering.\"\n* **NotebookLM Intermediary:** NotebookLM utilizes a specialized Source-Grounded RAG pipeline. It pre-processes documents into a semantic index. When you query it, the system retrieves only the relevant \"chunks\" to ground the answer.  \n**Validated Answer:** If you need to analyze the narrative arc or global structure of a 500-page book, Gemini’s direct context window is technically superior. If you need to find a needle in a haystack across 50 separate 100-page technical manuals, NotebookLM’s RAG-indexed architecture is more efficient for precision and citation.  \n\n## **The \"Special Sauce\" and Layering:**  \nYou asked if the \"special sauce\" (implicit reasoning) carries over when NotebookLM is used as a Gemini source.\n* **Layering and Hierarchy:** When you connect a Notebook to Gemini, the system manages three layers of data:\n   * **System Instructions:** The base \"Gemini\" persona.\n   * **External Knowledge:** The NotebookLM RAG-retrieved snippets.\n   * **Real-time Context:** The current conversation and any live web-search results.\n* **Uncertain/Non-Disclosed:** We do not have a publicly validated answer for the exact numerical \"weighting\" of these layers. We do not disclose how the model resolves a direct conflict between a Notebook source and a live web-search result, though internal protocols generally prioritize \"Grounding\" (the Notebook) for factual queries.  \n\n## **Reasoning Model Inheritance:**\n* **Validated Answer:** When you import a Notebook into Gemini, Gemini is NOT inheriting the NotebookLM \"personality\" or its specific UI-bound features (like the Audio Overview generator). It is pulling the grounding data and the metadata (citations).\n* **Implicit Reasoning:** NotebookLM has a specific \"strictness\" instruction (low temperature/high grounding) to prevent hallucinations. When you use that notebook inside a Gemini chat, that \"strictness\" can be diluted by Gemini's broader system instructions unless the user explicitly prompts: \"Only use the attached notebook for this answer.\"  \n\n## **Source Recognition by Name:**\n* **Validated Answer:** Yes. Because NotebookLM passes metadata headers (including file names) along with the retrieved text chunks, Gemini can identify specific sources. If you say, \"According to the 2024 Revenue Report...\", the RAG system uses that keyword to prioritize retrieval from that specific file's index.  \n\n## **Summary of Uncertainty**\n* **Proprietary Info:** We do not disclose the specific embedding model versions used for NotebookLM indexing versus standard Gemini File Search.\n* **Proprietary Info:** We do not provide a definitive answer on whether the \"reasoning\" is purely the LLM or if there are secondary \"re-ranker\" models specific to the NotebookLM-Gemini bridge that adjust the relevance of imported sources.  \n\n---\n> ## **At the end, it asked an interesting proposal that might be worth following up on:**\n---\n\n*Would you like me to draft a prompt for Gemini that forces it to prioritize the NotebookLM \"layer\" over its own internal training data?*\n\n---\n> ### **Edit 3: Markdown formatting pass to improve readability.**\n---",

Or you have to give AI studio multi step prompts with multiple documents. But you can go \"use the prompt in the Google doc to take the data from source 1 and apply it to the information in source 2 and provide it to me in the form of cells\" and that will work. But the performance and the limits of the tools seem to vary so I feel over the past year that what I have been doing has changed somewhat to adapt to the changes in performance. So next month I might have to try a new technique as it seems that's been the case every few months or so.",

          "text": "This isn’t even a question. For studying, research and learning notebooklm is miles better. \n\nGems is great for redundant and repetitive tasks imo. The amount of sources you can add are limited and it’s not as intuitive for studying. \n\nI use Gems for citation engines, let’s call it that. So I upload citation and reference guides in PDF format for each reference style and I use that Gem to doublecheck a footnote, bibliographic entry or attach the pdf of a journal article and ask it to cite it for me…\n\nNotebooklm is better for studying for several reasons:\n\n1) For one you can add more sources. 50 in free version, 300 in Pro and 600 in Ultra, and each one of them can be up to 500,000 words and 200MB. And it accepts virtually all file formats, MP3, doc, docx, pdf, pptx, txt, rtf, JPG, JPEG and video. And the difference is you can select specific sources for each task or question…but you canto do that in each new query in Gemini Gems\n\n2) You can create mind maps, slide decks, video overviews, audio overviews etc…And export them as well. Also whatever it generates for you can be added as a source within the notebook and it creates a cycle of information and knowledge. \n\nFor example for each course I have I upload the syllabus as a docx or pdf file and right away create a mindmap and it creates a visualization of the entire course. Or for midterms and final exams I select the relevant lectures, readings and notes I uploaded and it automatically creates a mindmap based on the weeks or topics. \n\n3) The audio overview feature is second to none tbh. I create one for each lecture I have to review and I literally just listen to those to prepare for tests and exams. I select the lecture slides, my pdf or docx notes from the lecture, and a transcription of the lecture(I record my university lectures) and I give it a custom prompt and set Theron of the audio overview to long and on deep dive mode. \n\nIt’s so accurate that it even picks up on small jokes and nuances my professor made during the lecture. And I can download them and listen offline…\n\n\nOh and btw notebooklm can transcribe uploaded recordings when you upsold them as a source. But I use nota AI since it’s even more accurate(highly recommend it tbh) it’s feature packed and suppers virtually all formats for exporting and has a lot of connectors and integrations. \n\n\n4) Notebooklm now has chat history and it’s honestly great to see what I was evening before. And the best part is you can now use Notebooklm notebooks as sources in Gemini chats and in Gemini Gems. \n\n\nBesides creating one for each course I create one for each large research paper or essay I am writing and I upload the instructions and info as a PDF and all my scholars journal articles. It’s a great way to find relevant quotes, pages, information etc…\n\nOr when I have dozens of or hundreds of sources it’s a great way to filter them out and see which ones are best for my sub arguments. \n\n\nSo overall Gems are great for redundant and repetitive tasks like: \n\n- Citations and references \n- Editing text \n- Creating Prompts\n\n\nNotebooklm Is great for:\n\n- Studying and learning \n- Research \n- Outlines \n- Notes",

              "text": "I'm sorry, but I find Perplexity Spaces lacking. As someone who has been a subscriber to ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity, and Claude for the past two years, I believe that NotebookLM the best option for projects similar to a ChatGPT project or Perplexity Spaces. The reason is its excellent integration with Google Workspace, seamless exporting, and the large context window it offers.\n\nAlthough they use Gemini 3 Flash, which lacks the reasoning of Gemini 3 Pro, the ability to upload so many sources and support various file formats, along with features like slide decks, overviews, mind maps, briefs, and reports, makes it superior. I would rank these tools based on their features as follows:\n\n1. NotebookLM\n2. ChatGPT Projects\n3. Perplexity Spaces\n\nHere's an important point: you may think you have access to those models in Perplexity Spaces, but there’s a misunderstanding. In Perplexity, even though you have access to these models, they are fine-tuned and optimized versions that are system-prompted for search and deep research. Thus, when using Gemini 3 Pro or Sonnet 4.5 or GPT 5.2 in Perplexity, it's not the same as accessing them in ChatGPT Cloud or in their native versions. This is primarily because all models in Perplexity are limited to a context window of 32k, which is significantly lower than what is becoming standard. In 2026, a 32k context will feel equivalent to an 8k context window.\n\nWhile Perplexity is excellent for web searches, fact-checking, and small tasks, it falls short for extensive research or work due to its limited context window. Furthermore, the claims about the models available in Perplexity can be misleading. You don't have full access to those models’ capabilities. You can test this by using the same prompt on both Gemini 3 Pro and Perplexity or comparing GPT 5.2 in Perplexity to GPT 5.2 in ChatGPT. The results will highlight significant differences, as the outputs from the native chatbots tend to be more thorough, better reasoned, and more logical.\n\nUntil Perplexity increases its context window, improves its long memory, and resolves the issue where the chat or query changes the model after a few exchanges, it is not fair to compare Perplexity Spaces to Notebook LM. While Notebook LM is better suited for more demanding tasks, Perplexity Spaces is more appropriate for smaller, simpler tasks.",

I use NotebookLM for what it’s great at, which is structuring and synthesizing the content, then I copy the outline or sectioned text straight into Gamma and let Gamma rebuild the deck from scratch. Once it’s in Gamma, everything is actually editable in a way that makes sense. Layouts, structure, wording, visuals, branding, all of it. It feels like working in a modern presentation tool instead of fighting a static export.\n\nThe key mental shift for me was treating NotebookLM as a content engine, not a slide designer. Gamma is the slide designer. Gamma understands hierarchy, flow, and visual rhythm far better, and it gives you real control without starting from a blank deck. From there I can export to PowerPoint or Google Slides if I need to, but most of the time I don’t even bother because Gamma already gets me to something client ready. If your frustration is that NotebookLM’s slides feel locked down and brittle, don’t try to fix them. Just regenerate the presentation in Gamma and move on with your life.",

I am extracting the structure that already exists in the notebook and then letting Gamma do what it is good at.\n\nNotebookLM absolutely can give you a detailed, slide by slide outline if you ask it the right way. I will literally prompt it with something like “rewrite this content as a slide outline, one slide per section, with a clear title and 3 to 5 bullets per slide.” It is already holding the context of the sources and the notes, so the outline it produces is not some brand new invention. It is a structured restatement of the same material. That outline is what I copy into Gamma.\n\nSo yes, the final deck in Gamma is technically regenerated, but the content, sequencing, and intent are coming directly from NotebookLM. I am not manually rethinking the presentation or inventing a new one. I am just forcing the handoff at the right abstraction level. Trying to convert NotebookLM’s rendered slides into editable slides is the wrong layer to work at. There is no clean path there today.\n\nIf someone’s definition of a solution is preserving the exact NotebookLM slide objects and tweaking them, I agree that does not really exist yet. My point is that the practical solution is to stop treating NotebookLM’s slides as something worth salvaging. Use it for synthesis and structure, get a clean outline, and then let a tool like Gamma turn that outline into something that behaves like a real presentation. That is the only workflow I have found that is fast, repeatable, and doesn’t feel like fighting the tool.",

I teach a course on \"Design and Product Development\" at Northeastern University, and I have mandated the students to use NotebookLM as the knowledge repository for their semester project. I started them off by just having them upload chapters from the textbook as well as the case studies.\n\nAfter they did that, I had them focus on the chat, and told them to copy all the follow-up questions suggested and post them as prompts. NotebookLM responded with answers to each with follow-up questions. I had them click each responce to save as note, and then repeat the copy and paste for all subsequent suggested questions. By the end, they had a robust repository of related knowledge saved as notes. I had them next save the notes as sources. Then, I had them generate a mind map, and explore the topics. I had them click on a few end points to generate detailed replies...save as note...convert to source. I then had them generate a generic Infographic to illustrate what happens when you overload the tool with too many sources. Then, I had them generate another infographic after deselecting all the sources EXCEPT ones relevant to a particular case study, and use the edit pencil in the tool to prompt exactly what they want the infographic to show. I had them do the same for the slide show, the video, the audio, etc. In the podcast, I have them use the call-in function to ask specific questions. I also have them generate quizes and flash cards to help them master a topic.\n\nFinally, I created a notebook with 300 sources and various tool outputs that show the capability.",

At some point it starts to feel like I'm going in circles just rearranging the same info and not making progress.\n\nI don’t think you’re missing any secret sauce by not using all the outputs. If anything, using all of them can make the big picture blurrier. I’ve found it works better when I pick one format that sort of becomes the anchor and then I just keep asking better questions against it. The moment I start bouncing between formats, I lose the thread and end up with a lot of “nice summaries\" but not much else.\n\nThe other thing is…it kinda assumes you already know what you’re looking for. If your question is sharp, it feels magical. If your question is still forming...not so much. That’s probably why so many “how to use it” resources feel unsatisfying, because they don’t talk about how to really use it for learning, just how to click buttons and get different outputs.\n\nAlso feels like source structure matters way more than people admit. If everything goes into one bucket, the outputs start to feel samey and mushy, no matter how clean the formatting is.",

Is it better to have data digested by the system and then ask questions, or would a simple Google search be enough for the whole process? That’s the question I constantly ask myself.",

And when I reflect when I did best and thoroughly enjoyed learning, it was always a \"slog\" but to be honest AI can help us be more productive but we lose all the learning in-between. \n\nLearning while AI does the work, at least to me, is a management/coordination skill and less of technical problem solving. \n\nIf your goal is to ultimately get accustomed to material, it doesn't matter if the AI can write you an essay, you still need to sit, read, and parse it. And at that point, I actually prefer parsing the source material most of the time but I enjoy how certain people write over the AI especially since the AI requires so much hand holding to really get into the nuance (and because you aren't a subject experts, who really knows what is right) while subject experts guide you towards the nuance.  \n\nAI has its places like general planning and overview, but I use it more to help me find resources as a learner. (And the latest Gemini has really sucked tbh.)",

If I have to check its quality I might as well find my own. \n\nThis is what I do.\n\nLet’s say you want to learn a totally new subject. This subject has say 3 experts. Each expert has written books and did some interviews and lectures on YT. I’d create one notebook for each expert and prompt the chat to pretend it’s the expert. Then have a conversation with the experts. You can stop here. Or create a new notebook and put all three experts’ sources in there. Then for the chat, you can prompt it to be a professor and your sources are its teaching material. Or to be creative, you can prompt it to be a debate moderator and have the three experts debate amongst themselves.\n\nNBLM is simply an LLM for (your) source materials. Nothing more. Use it for its strengths.",

If your goal is to study, create an tutor gem and upload the book pdf, ask it to summarise and explain the material and also to give an enectode to remember stuff easily, the guided learning tool is extremely useful for learning.

      "text": "Over the past few months, I’ve been integrating NotebookLM into my agency workflow, and it’s quietly become one of the most strategic tools in our stack.\n\nI still see a real adoption curve in the business world. Many companies are experimenting with AI, but few truly operationalize it. Most are stuck at “content generation.” What’s working for us is different: we build specialized notebooks for each client.\n\nInstead of sending scattered Google Docs, PDFs, Loom videos, or Slack threads, we centralize everything inside a structured NotebookLM environment:\n\n    •\tCore brand documentation\n    \n    •\tStrategy decks and research\n    \n    •\tBlog articles and SEO drafts\n    \n    •\tInternal SOPs\n    \n    •\tAudio summaries or podcast-style briefings\n    \n    •\tVisual references and campaign assets\n\nThe value isn’t just organization—it’s contextual intelligence. Clients can query their own strategy. They can explore campaign rationale. They can generate derivative content based on approved materials. It transforms documentation into an interactive asset.\n\nFrom a monetization standpoint, this has helped us in three ways:\n\n    1.\tHigher perceived value – We’re not just delivering services; we’re delivering a knowledge system.\n    \n    2.\tBetter retention – The notebook becomes part of their operational backbone.\n    \n    3.\tUpsell opportunities – Once they see how powerful a structured AI knowledge base is, expanding scope becomes natural.\n\nThe interesting part? Many businesses still see tools like this as “personal productivity” platforms rather than client-facing strategic infrastructure.\n\nI’m curious:\n\nIs anyone here using NotebookLM inside an agency model or client services environment to generate revenue?\n\nOr are most of you using it strictly for personal research and organization?\n\nWould love to hear real-world use cases—especially around monetization and long-term client integration.",

I’m about to start the literature review / state of the art and I’m looking for a step-by-step AI-assisted workflow to support this phase.\n\nWhat I’m specifically looking for is help using AI to find solid academic sources, identify key authors and concepts, and then produce a structured synthesis of the literature (definitions, main arguments, convergences/divergences), with real, verifiable citations. The goal is not to copy-paste AI-generated paragraphs, but to end up with a reliable account that helps me write my own paragraphs in my own words.\n\nI currently have access to Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity, and I’m curious how people combine tools like these in practice. How do you use AI to support source discovery, information extraction, and citation management without hallucinated references?\n\nIf you have concrete workflows, tools you trust, or pitfalls to avoid (especially around citations and verification), I’d really appreciate your feedback.

The find sources function isn't half bad and can find quite a few scholarly things - definitely won't find you everything relevant and additional Actual research will still be required to make sure you have a good, representative sample of sources. Usually I do this by looking at what is cited by the scholarly sources it pulls and looking at the related articles on whatever platform owns the journal (ebsco, proquest, etc), going on a wiki walk just collecting as much info as I can, adding to NotebookLM as I go. Then winnow down to what's most relevant. \n\nYou can use the whole-notebook summary from the landing/chat page as a prompt for the find sources function to expand further. I have a free year of the pro plan with my student email, so I tend to go a bit overboard on collecting sources. Then you can use the various studio functions to start pulling out trends and arguments via reports (my personal favorite), mind maps, slides, audio overview....this tool has made research, which I've always enjoyed doing even on my own time, so much more straightforward and getting to both conclusions, and deeper questions, so much faster. I genuinely don't even feel the need to pull in any other tools 98% of the time.\n\nGood luck with your thesis! Sounds like a really interesting topic - I just finished my MLIS. Let me know if you want some help tracking down full published books on your topic, sounds like it could be a fun opportunity to practice my professional skills 😉",

      "text": "I’ve been using NotebookLM extensively for creating comprehensive learning materials, specifically trying to simulate \"Graduate Level Seminars\" where the hosts analyze sources line-by-line rather than just summarizing them.\n\nThe Use Case:\n\nI use custom instructions to tell the AI to parse the source material in extreme detail (parsing every line, discussing historical/psychological context, recapping every 7 minutes, and aiming for a \"lossless\" transfer of information). My goal is to use this for language learning and deep academic study, where a 10-minute summary isn't enough—I need the full 30-60+ minute breakdown.\n\nThe Issue:\n\nPreviously, I could manage to get 25-35 minute Video Overviews by using very specific prompts asking for extended length and detailed breakdowns. However, recently, no matter how much I emphasize \"Do not summarize\" or \"Parse every line\" in the prompt, the output seems to hit a hard cap.\n\nShort outputs: It wraps up in 6-9 minutes, glossing over the details.\n\nGeneration Failed: If I push the prompt too hard (asking for 90 mins, detailed mic-recaps), it processes for a while and then returns a \"Network Error\" or \"Generation Failed.\"\n\nThe Request to the Team:\n\nIs there a strict output token limit that has been tightened recently?\n\nFor users who need comprehensive education rather than quick summaries, could we get a \"Deep Dive\" or \"Extended Duration\" toggle?\n\nWe are willing to wait longer for the generation if it means the hosts won't rush through the content. A \"Lecture Mode\" that allows for 45+ minutes of audio generation would be a game-changer for using NotebookLM as a serious study companion.\n\nMy current prompt strategy (abbreviated):\n\n\"Parse Each Line. Recap Every 7 mins. Two experts recording a graduate seminar. Explain every keyword in multiple languages. Focus on depth over brevity. Ignore length limits...\"\n\nHas anyone else found a workaround to force the hosts to slow down and cover the entirety of a long source without summarizing?\n\nThanks!",

NotebookLM is just designed as a chatbot that has access to your files that you add, but not designed as a \"workspace\" in the sense that you can use AI's output to write back to your files, and then improve the entire workspace's knowledge as a whole over time.\n\nIf you want more note-writing functionality, you'll need Notion, Obsidian or Atlas Workspace. Obsidian doesn't come with AI though, and Notion's UI feels clunky and janky these days. Atlas Workspace is also built for answers grounded in citations like NotebookLM, and can even use AI to do high-level re-organizing of your notes (grouping notes, making connections, etc). Probably the best for research projects at the moment.",

If you're using it to remember 'everything' about a material, especially with you not checking it, its liable to get wrong - I noticed this when I generated prompts in the audio overview. I suspect the same happens even with the chatbot,  \n  \nAlso, and regarding placing a youtube link to notebooklm - I've tried it, and I noticed what notebooklm REALLY does is NOT 'watch' the video (apparently Gemini can 'watch' videos but its not exact), but rather transcribes the audio from the video. And the problem with THAT is that it still get some facts wrong, ESPECIALLY if it transcribes the wrong audio or misheard stuff. I found more success with literally watching the video and, from there, transcribing the video.  \n  \nWay I see it, notebooklm is not a replacement for 'watching stuff'.
