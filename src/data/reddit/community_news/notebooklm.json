You can stack a bunch of changes before you regenerate, which is nice. And PPTX export finally works.\n\nBut there are a few things I wish someone had told me before I got too hyped:\n\nThe big one: when you edit an individual slide, it does NOT reference your original sources. It's working only with what's already on that slide. Google actually says this in their own docs - \"sources are not taken into account during revisions.\" So if you're expecting it to pull fresh citations from your uploaded materials when you ask for a revision, it won't.\n\nAlso - can't add or remove slides yet. You can change the text, rearrange the layout, update visuals, but the number of slides is locked. Worth knowing upfront.\n\nDaily limit on regenerations exists but Google hasn't said exactly how many. People in this sub are reporting hitting it somewhere between 10-20 decks a day.\n\nOh and it's PRO and ULTRA only right now. Free tier is coming \"soon\" with no actual date. And if you're paid but still don't see it - still rolling out, I'm Pro and mine isn't live yet either.\n\nGoogle Slides export is announced but not there yet.\n\nOverall: genuinely useful update, not vaporware. The workflow does change in a real way. Just don't go rebuilding your whole process around it without understanding the source limitation thing first.\n\nAnyone else already have it live? Curious if the experience matches this.",

But the editing situation has been driving me crazy.\n\nWhen they first dropped slides there was basically no editing at all, and the recent update helped but it's still fully AI-dependent - you're instructing changes slide by slide rather than just...making them. I wanted to be able to move things around, tweak text directly, adjust layout and test multiple changes without going back and forth with prompts.\n\nTried Canva's grab text feature for the image slides but honestly found it clunky for elements specifically.\n\nStumbled across a workaround today on reddit that actually solved it for me - uploaded the notebookLM PDF to a converter tool and it turned the image-based slides into fully editable ones. Meaning I could directly edit text, move elements, touch the layout - and I got to do all this without consuming credits so basically on their free tier. Exported to PowerPoint and the editability carried over too, which was the main thing I needed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e9nvpsdd7ikg1.png?width=1844&format=png&auto=webp&s=07652bc210506d791c10f88a15c19eb02133cac7\n\nSharing in case anyone else is looking to solve the same problem - [https://app.getalai.com/notebooklm](https://app.getalai.com/notebooklm)",

      "text": "Claude Code and Kimi have these features where you can make different agents with their respective models talk to each other and collaborate. But Claude and Kimi models aren't good at everything, and I started to wonder what would happen if different models from different providers worked together. So that's what I did.\n\nUsing the three flagship models: GPT-5.2, Opus 4.6, and Gemini 3.1, I wanted to test how their three different personalities would mesh if I gave a simple prompt without any guidance or structure. I uploaded my sources (Spreadsheet, Fully loaded PDF with images), and just told them the background of the task and what I needed. I disabled internet access so they can only use the sources like in Notebook LM\n\nHere's what happened:\n\nOpus 4.6, not surprisingly, took the lead. It split up the work and told the other agents their part. Then it did its part and called it a day.\n\nGPT-5.2 ignored the other agents. It decided it could handle the project by itself with its sub-agents, and it did. It redid all the work Opus 4.6 did and sent me back the full completed project.\n\nGemini 3.1 spent most of its time understanding the project and the files I uploaded. I think it got this skill from Notebook LM since the platform is more focused on Sources. When it was ready to work, it tried contacting the other agents about questions but was getting ignored, due to the fact that Opus was done with its part and GPT-5.2 was doing everything itself.\n\nIn the end, Gemini only fixed minor issues in GPT's work after realizing the project was completed.\n\nI'm sure with proper prompting, I could've gotten these models to work together, but I wanted to see how their different personalities would mesh naturally, like a real human team.\n\n  \nHere's the full [post](https://martinovolcy.substack.com/p/i-made-gpt-52-opus-46-and-gemini) for details\n\nHere's the [website](https://showcase.thytus.com/v1/guides) i used to do the experiment",

NotebookLM found a mention from 1991. off by 25 years.\n\nHere's the thing. if you look at Gemini's thought process it literally says it's searching based on likelihood and prioritizing where the answer is most likely to be. it's not actually reading through everything you gave it. it's guessing where to look based on what it already knows.\n\nTo make it even more obvious, I searched the same question on Gemini without any notebooks attached. same answer. 2016. so the notebooks didn't even change what Gemini told me. it just fell back on what it already knew and ignored my sources.\n\nNotebookLM actually went through the documents and found something Gemini never would have. a 1991 letter where Buffett called Apple a \"Mistake Du Jour\" because tech was outside his circle of competence. that completely changes the story.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1r7gz9j/video/skxhhnxv14kg1/player\n\n",

It forces the AI to actually work through your content chronologically and logically, rather than pattern-matching what it's heard before. You build understanding from what you actually fed it, not what the model thinks is probable. dm me if you wanna see how it handles that kind of deep source verification differently.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI genuinely love NotebookLM. It’s one of the most interesting tools I’ve used for working with sources and thinking through material.\n\nThat said, reading through this thread, it’s clear a lot of us are running into similar friction points:\n\n* No real folder structure for organizing notebooks or sources\n* No bulk actions for managing files\n* No easy way to select groups of sources across folders\n* No automatic syncing from Drive\n* Limited control over outputs like podcasts or lecture style flows\n* No real way to act on files beyond asking questions\n\nAt some point it starts to feel less like a workspace and more like a Q and A layer on top of documents.\n\nThat frustration is actually what led us to build something different at [thedrive.ai](https://thedrive.ai)\n\nWe’re building an alternative that keeps the AI reasoning layer, but also lets you treat it like a real file system. You can organize into folders (in fact all files uploaded to root folder gets automatically organized), actually open and view PDFs, rename files in bulk, merge or split PDFs, fill them out, move things around, and even create new documents using plain English.\n\nThe idea is simple: AI should not just answer questions about your files. It should be able to work with them.\n\nI know this is a NotebookLM community, and I am not here to bash it. It is a great product. We just kept hitting these limits ourselves and decided to build around them instead of waiting.\n\nIf you could redesign NotebookLM to solve one core pain point from this thread, what would you fix first?\n\nGenuinely curious, and would love for you to give it a try.",

While that is currently available only at the Enterprise level, there are a few open source version on GitHub.\n\nMore recently, Google announced Gemini 3 has the capability to write apps that combine notebooks to deliver value.\n\nIt is a powerful base tool and is rapidly evolving.",

      "text": "I have been loving NotebookLM as a research tool and creative studio.\n\nI have a solution that works to edit the mistakes NotebookLM makes on slides and infographics without paying for another too..\n\nThere are some REALLY FRUSTRATING issues that Google could have solved by now for us.  \n\nI have been frustrated because it will generate a stunning infographic or slide deck with just a few misspelled words or insert things like \"Jetbrains Mono\" or \"Inter\" in very weird places.  And this is frustrating because these few mistakes ruin sometimes stunning designs.\n\nAlso, sometimes for slides or infographics the title or some text is just a bit off in terms of wording.  And there is no way to edit it!!!!    \n\nThis Is DUMB!\n\nOf course, I also use tools like Gamma and it does generate nice slides you can edit.  But the designs are not as nice as NotebookLM powered by Nano Banana pro.  \n  \nAnd yes, I am aware you can pull stuff from NotebookLM into Canva but I find Canva more than a bit confusing at a time and shouldn't have to pay for that to edit NotebookLM outputs.\n\nAlso another frustration is you can only download slides as PDF from notebookLM and that is also very DUMB!    \n  \nWhy can't we export to Slides?  Other LLMs like MANUS allow that but NotebookLM doesn't?   This is product management failure 101.  \n\nFinally, if people are on the Ultra plan or enterprise plan putting the NotebookLM logo on everything is really OBNOXIOUS.  They should do like they do for Ultra plan users in Gemini where they don't add the Gemini logo in the bottom right hand corner of every image generated.  \n  \n/venting off   \n\nTHE SOLUTION \n\nI take screen shots of infographics / Slides and add them into Google slides one slide per image.  \n\nThen right click on the image and select Edit Image.\n\nIn the right hand side bar you can then type whatever visual edits or text edits you need.\n\nIt has very good prompt adherence if you give good direction and then you can undo the MISTAKES that ruined the stunning design.  \n\nOf course you can then export slides to PDF or copy the images. \n\nYou can else Edit Images in AI Studio with good adherence as well if you pay for it with the API usage and that works pretty well.  \n\nI have found using the regular Gemini interface the Edit Image is more 50/50 odds it listens to your direction. \n\nAlas, if the product managers for NotebookLM were on top of it we should be able to EDIT the slides or infographics in a sidebar just like you can in Slides without all these extra clicks and mind gymnastics!\n\nSorry for the venting but I hope this is helpful for those who don't want to use Canva or pay for another tool to edit mistakes NotebookLM makes. \n\nI know, it's getting better every month....  And this is the worst it will ever be... \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n",

Instead of having to input manual sources into notebook LM, all you have to do is press the source discovery, and you just input the topic you want and it’ll search online and give you a bunch of resources that you can then input into your notebook. Why I like it? Because it’s streamlines your notebooks and it makes it much more efficient if you don’t have time to get manual sources, or you want to study a topic that you don’t have time to investigate by yourself, it will gather all the sources kind of reminiscent to deep research on some models, from which then you can do what you would normally do in a notebook which you could ask questions about it or get an audio overview and so on. what is your favorite feature?",

Basically I uploaded the canon source books and my own fanfic draft, then used it to check if my canon characters sound accurate like whether they talk and think the way the author actually wrote them. I'd ask things like how does this character react when they're calm vs when they're angry, or what dialogue tags does the author actually use for them, stuff like that. And then I take what I learn and use it to write or adjust my own dialogue and scenes so they feel true to the source material but still my own version. It's really useful for catching when I'm off  like I thought a certain word fit a character but when I actually checked the books the pattern told a different story.\n\nSo it's basically become my canon accuracy checker while I write. Saves a lot of time flipping through books manually.",

I feel like knowing external trivia and reception around a work somehow helps me remember the details of the work itself better, too, like knowing people argued about it helps make it stick. I've also uploaded episode transcripts to do media analysis type stuff on for my own curiosity, wanting to dig deeper on the text itself.
