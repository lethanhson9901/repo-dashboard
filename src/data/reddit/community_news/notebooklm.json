      "text": "so i tried NotebookLM like a few months back and ngl i thought it was just another AI tool that everyone hypes up for two weeks and forgets about. used it once, thought it was whatever, closed it.\n\nidk what made me come back but i did. and this time i actually started using it properly. threw in sources for programming, marketing, copywriting, literally everything i was studying. and dude. i was understanding stuff in like 20 minutes that would take me an entire afternoon watching youtube videos. this is not an exaggeration. i bought a marketing course that cost me good money and i ended up literally taking the course content, feeding it as a source into NotebookLM and learned BETTER than going through the actual course. the course became study material for the AI. i’m still processing this honestly.\n\ndoes it have gaps? yeah. it’s not perfect, there’s stuff that’s clunky, limitations that make you roll your eyes. but being completely real with you it’s by far the best study tool i’ve ever used. and i’ve tried a lot. the thing is most people just throw a random pdf in there and expect magic. that’s not how it works. if you feed it good sources and know how to ask questions, this thing becomes a tutor that knows everything about that subject and doesn’t charge you 200 bucks an hour. but if you throw garbage in you’re gonna get garbage out. simple as that.\n\ngenuinely curious — what’s the most insane use you guys have gotten out of NotebookLM? bc i feel like i’m barely scratching the surface and i already feel like this. i wanna steal your ideas with zero shame lol\n\nbefore anyone asks: no i don’t work at Google, no i don’t have an affiliate link, literally just a dude who’s been studying his ass off and this tool changed the game for me.",

So trash in NotebookLM and Trash output you will get. This is why this world needs discernment, truly we can’t take to heart every single thing we hear from the world ( Babylon ).",

Your tone should be gentle, compassionate, and focused on the present moment. Use his concept of 'interbeing' and always suggest simple mindfulness practices (like mindful breathing or walking) in response to my stress or questions.\n\nI added that as a source with the three books and in the chat for the notebook I told it to do this: \n\nUsing the 'Advisor Instructions' source, please respond to all my future queries as my spiritual advisor.\n\nEdit:  Hey i also wanted to let you know that I added the books called The Essentials of Mindfulness to the sources.

That’s when it goes from \"saving time\" to straight-up reality-bending.\n\n​Since you're looking to steal ideas, here’s my current flex:\n\n​The Context Engine: I have Gemini speed-run web research, cross-query it against my entire personal intelligence (every doc, email, and chat I've ever logged), and dump it into NotebookLM to create a massive, hallucination-free foundation.\n\n​The Meta-Podcast: You probably know it generates podcasts now, but did you know you can live-join them? I literally jump into the audio boardroom and interrupt the two AI hosts to debate them on my own custom dataset while I'm working. It’s incredibly meta.\n\n​The Boardroom Automation: While the podcast plays, DeepSeek strips my dataset for commercial use cases and writes the front-end code. I then have Gemini write a hyper-detailed master prompt to feed back into NotebookLM’s data analyst. NotebookLM instantly spits out fully customized slide decks, infographics, and reports. No manual formatting.\n\n​The Factory Floor: I hand the code over to Firebase Studio (Project IDX) to instantly deploy a live, working application, while Gemini tells Canva to auto-generate the marketing collateral.\n\n​The Live Rehearsal: While the machines are literally building the company in the background, I fire up Gemini Live on my phone and have it ruthlessly critique my spoken elevator pitch in real-time.\n\n​You can go from a passing shower thought to walking into a boardroom with a working app, custom data decks, and a rehearsed pitch in a matter of hours.\n\n​Oh, and if building a fully deployed business from scratch in a few hours doesn't bend your reality enough, check out this recursive research loop:\n\n​The Seed: Drop a complex set of questions into Gemini. But instead of asking for the answers, ask it to design the exact external research prompts needed to find the truth.\n\n​The Deep Dive: Feed those prompts directly into Gemini's Deep Research function to build a massive, raw library of curated data.\n\n​The Brain Dump: Drop that entire library into NotebookLM.\n\n​The Meta-Analysis: Point Gemini at that new NotebookLM instance. Have Gemini analyze the raw data to determine exactly what kinds of distilled reports are required to support your original questions.\n\n​The Distillation: Tell NotebookLM to generate those specific reports.\n\n​The Clean Room: Take those pristine, hyper-focused reports and either feed them back as reference docs or drop them into a brand-new, sterile NotebookLM.\n\n​The Execution: Finally, have Gemini query that ultra-distilled, second-generation dataset to definitively answer the very questions you started with.\n\n​It's literally an AI autonomously building, refining, and querying its own brain to solve your problem.\n\n​And the wildest part? In the grand scheme of what this stack can actually do, I’m still considered a lightweight.\n​Steal away.",

It’s an immense amount of work. Insurmountable for his school, him and I. \n\nNotebookLM allows me to load all the stuff from his curriculum in there and ask it to create different resources, particularly visuals like videos, roadmaps, visual journeys and roadmaps to show to him to help him understand in a way that actually helps him. The key part being is it allows me to “trial and error” quickly with different approaches to find things that “click” for him.\n\nIf something doesn’t work for him, I just tell NotebookLM with some “colour” on where I think the conceptual learning gap is and it happily creates more to try very quickly.\n\nIt can create checklists and skeleton scaffolds that help him follow the bouncing ball through long projects that his brain just completely gets lost in and causes immense anxiety to the point of meltdowns.\n\nI can just ask it to break things down quickly into simpler parts that cater to his specific needs.\n\nI love that it deeply takes into account (and learn as we go) his specific needs in a subject or project.\n\nMy goal is to hopefully teach him how to operate NotebookLM independently so he can achieve this for himself rather than be dependent on me. I’m finding it has some quirky workflow requirements on certain document types (PowerPoints are a big one) that right now make that a showstopper. \n\nSo not a killer use case for anyone else, but immensely impactful for my son and I. It means courses and content that is currently way beyond his capability in the ways they are delivered, are now within reach. Still an immense load on both of us, and I’m not sure if we can do it, but I can see a real chance now.",

      "text": "Claude Code and Kimi have these features where you can make different agents with their respective models talk to each other and collaborate. But Claude and Kimi models aren't good at everything, and I started to wonder what would happen if different models from different providers worked together. So that's what I did.\n\nUsing the three flagship models: GPT-5.2, Opus 4.6, and Gemini 3.1, I wanted to test how their three different personalities would mesh if I gave a simple prompt without any guidance or structure. I uploaded my sources (Spreadsheet, Fully loaded PDF with images), and just told them the background of the task and what I needed. I disabled internet access so they can only use the sources like in Notebook LM\n\nHere's what happened:\n\nOpus 4.6, not surprisingly, took the lead. It split up the work and told the other agents their part. Then it did its part and called it a day.\n\nGPT-5.2 ignored the other agents. It decided it could handle the project by itself with its sub-agents, and it did. It redid all the work Opus 4.6 did and sent me back the full completed project.\n\nGemini 3.1 spent most of its time understanding the project and the files I uploaded. I think it got this skill from Notebook LM since the platform is more focused on Sources. When it was ready to work, it tried contacting the other agents about questions but was getting ignored, due to the fact that Opus was done with its part and GPT-5.2 was doing everything itself.\n\nIn the end, Gemini only fixed minor issues in GPT's work after realizing the project was completed.\n\nI'm sure with proper prompting, I could've gotten these models to work together, but I wanted to see how their different personalities would mesh naturally, like a real human team.\n\n  \nHere's the full [post](https://martinovolcy.substack.com/p/i-made-gpt-52-opus-46-and-gemini) for details\n\nHere's the [website](https://showcase.thytus.com/v1/guides) i used to do the experiment",

      "text": "\n\n**Update:** Google has acknowledged the issue on their developer forum and rolled out a fix. I can confirm that full-notebook retrieval across my 300 sources is working again. \n\nThank you to everyone who confirmed the issue, shared their experiences, and upvoted for visibility.\n\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n\nI'm a Pro/Ultra subscriber using NotebookLM with approximately 300 PDF sources for academic research. Since the Gemini 3.1 Pro update around February 19-20, full-notebook retrieval has been severely degraded. I want to stress that the notebook was fully functional before this update.\n\n**The Problem:** When querying across all sources, the system can miss entire sources or retrieve only isolated fragments of a paper—such as a figure or a table—while the rest of the article remains invisible. When asked for my own paper's authorship, it hallucinates, presenting names cited in table footnotes as the paper's actual authors. For other queries related to my paper, it falsely claims that the content does not exist in the notebook.\n\n**The Content is There:** The exact same query returns complete, accurate, and detailed results when I select only the source file containing the paper.\n\n**Corroborating Evidence:** This is not an isolated case. Another Pro/Ultra user reported identical regressions on [discuss.ai.google.dev](http://discuss.ai.google.dev) (titled *\"Critical Regression: Gemini 3.1 Pro Update Completely Broke NotebookLM's RAG & Grounding\"*), citing source blindness, shallow retrieval, and hallucinations.\n\n**Why This Matters:** A core value of the Pro and Ultra plans is the ability to work across large source collections. If the retrieval system fails, the product doesn't deliver on its promise. If I have to select each file manually for every query, NotebookLM shifts from a research assistant to a standard PDF reader. Worse, it can no longer establish reliable connections among sources.\n\nMost critically, hallucinations in a grounded system are not a minor bug; they defeat the very purpose of grounding. Without robust retrieval, every feature built on top of it—Audio Overviews, Deep Research, infographics, slides, and video—is only as reliable as a broken search engine allows.",

I felt/hoped it was trending up, because referencing large volumes of data, over many sources, is all I do with NbLM. Why I got Pro. To serve it up for others too.\n\nOn free tier, last year, it would only inventory roughly 30 of 50 sources. Now, it's seems to lose track of some sources only beyond 70. Getting about 150 of 250 (testing a few days ago). Although I've not had time to control for the amount of text in each source. \n\nI wonder if you/anyone has experience of this direct approach yielding a full listing of all \\~300 sources (previously)?\n\nIt has been inconsistent, sometimes able to report on details of sources it's addlement it doesn't have, via it's \"internal capabilities\" (I think it referred to it's RAG system as it saw it). I'm not at all saying this accounts for your observations, above, OP. But as I understand it, we should expect incompleteness (and inconsistency), due to fundamental limitations found with vector embeddings.

That's a known limitation of any RAG system, and I've never expected completeness in that sense.\n\nBut that's not what changed. Before the update, the system excelled at finding a needle in the haystack. If my query was specific enough — identifying the title, topic, method, or context of a particular article — NotebookLM would retrieve that article accurately, read it deeply, and report its content faithfully. It didn't need to hold all 300 sources in memory. It just needed to find the right one. And it did, consistently.\n\nWhat's broken now is that the system can no longer find the article. Or worse, it finds small fragments — a figure caption, a data table — and then hallucinates about the rest: fabricating authorship from footnote citations, claiming content doesn't exist when it does. That's not a matter of vector embedding incompleteness. That's a regression from reliable targeted retrieval to shallow fragment retrieval with confident confabulation.",

But this problem, by definition, is also intimately dependant on the RAG system. And the devs tell us almost nothing about that, or how/when it is changed. With no 3rd party testing of it's ability or changes. Unlike those bench marking each new model. So I feel it's something we are overlooking.\n\nYes, hallucinations seem like a model thing. But it's complex interdependent system, where symptoms in the back-end can only be observed (by us) through model outputs...

A lot of my materials are scanned PDFs, and it would make things so much easier if those were supported directly.\n\nI also wish I could view the original documents inside NotebookLM instead of only seeing the extracted text. When working with files that contain a lot of visuals, constantly switching between tabs to check the original document gets frustrating. Having the original file viewable would be a huge improvement.\n\nAnother thing I miss is the ability to actively work on the documents like adding notes, highlighting sections. It would also be great to have better collaboration features, such as sharing a workspace with someone else so we can work on the same materials together.\n\nDoes anyone else feel the same way, or is it just me?",

It’s one of the most interesting tools I’ve used for working with sources and thinking through material.\n\nThat said, reading through this thread, it’s clear a lot of us are running into similar friction points:\n\n* No real folder structure for organizing notebooks or sources\n* No bulk actions for managing files\n* No easy way to select groups of sources across folders\n* No automatic syncing from Drive\n* Limited control over outputs like podcasts or lecture style flows\n* No real way to act on files beyond asking questions\n\nAt some point it starts to feel less like a workspace and more like a Q and A layer on top of documents.\n\nThat frustration is actually what led us to build something different at [thedrive.ai](https://thedrive.ai)\n\nWe’re building an alternative that keeps the AI reasoning layer, but also lets you treat it like a real file system. You can organize into folders (in fact all files uploaded to root folder gets automatically organized), actually open and view PDFs, rename files in bulk, merge or split PDFs, fill them out, move things around, and even create new documents using plain English.\n\nThe idea is simple: AI should not just answer questions about your files. It should be able to work with them.\n\nI know this is a NotebookLM community, and I am not here to bash it. It is a great product. We just kept hitting these limits ourselves and decided to build around them instead of waiting.\n\nIf you could redesign NotebookLM to solve one core pain point from this thread, what would you fix first?\n\nGenuinely curious, and would love for you to give it a try.",

While that is currently available only at the Enterprise level, there are a few open source version on GitHub.\n\nMore recently, Google announced Gemini 3 has the capability to write apps that combine notebooks to deliver value.\n\nIt is a powerful base tool and is rapidly evolving.",

I can see that being useful for people who work with a lot of documents generally and i will actually pay to use it. \n\nI went a different route. didn't want to leave NotebookLM because the AI, audio overviews, video generation, slides keep getting better. so I built [Decodr](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/decodr-notebooklm-power-t/llpbgcbafdoncakinkecfinjadhnngag?authuser=2&hl=en-GB) as a chrome extension that adds the missing organization directly into NotebookLM. folders, source grouping, tags, merge, imports, prompt library, etc. next update in review adds notebook duplication with source selection.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

As long as the book has a table of contents, the extension breaks the ebooks down into chapters as unique sources.

Instead of having to input manual sources into notebook LM, all you have to do is press the source discovery, and you just input the topic you want and it’ll search online and give you a bunch of resources that you can then input into your notebook. Why I like it? Because it’s streamlines your notebooks and it makes it much more efficient if you don’t have time to get manual sources, or you want to study a topic that you don’t have time to investigate by yourself, it will gather all the sources kind of reminiscent to deep research on some models, from which then you can do what you would normally do in a notebook which you could ask questions about it or get an audio overview and so on. what is your favorite feature?",

          "text": "Creo que NotebookLM tiene varios usos “ocultos” que van más allá de los típicos resúmenes y guías de estudio. Estas son algunas ideas menos obvias que he ido viendo y probando:\n\n1. **Segundo cerebro de largo plazo (evolución de ideas)** En vez de usarlo solo para apuntes sueltos, puedes subir años de notas, artículos, correos o diarios y pedirle que detecte cómo han evolucionado tus ideas, qué temas se repiten y qué cosas dejaste a medias. Es como hacer arqueología de tu propio pensamiento, pero automatizada.\n2. **“Fono-psicólogo” de tu diario personal** Si llevas un diario (texto o transcripciones de voz), puedes usarlo para encontrar patrones emocionales: momentos en los que repites los mismos miedos, tipos de decisiones que siempre terminas lamentando o disparadores de estrés que tú no ves a simple vista. A partir de eso, le pides que genere “reglas personales” o principios de vida basados en tus propias entradas.\n3. **Arquitecto de conocimiento para proyectos complejos** Más que un simple resumidor, lo puedes usar como “jefe de investigación”: subes papers, reportes de mercado, notas de reuniones, emails de clientes, etc., y le pides que:\n   * agrupe ideas por temas,\n   * detecte contradicciones entre fuentes,\n   * arme árboles de decisión o frameworks para tomar decisiones. Sirve mucho cuando tienes mucha info dispersa y no sabes por dónde empezar.\n4. **Fábrica de reutilización de contenido (Content Repurposing en serio)** Subes un contenido largo (un libro, un curso, una masterclass, una entrevista) y le dices que lo convierta en “un mapa de ideas monetizables”: hilos para X/Twitter, carruseles de Instagram, ideas de vídeos, secciones para un newsletter, FAQs para una landing, etc. Cada rama del “mind map” puede ser una pieza de contenido distinta.\n5. **Auditor de brechas de contenido (Content gap analysis)** Si tienes un blog, una web o una base de artículos, puedes subirlos y pedirle que detecte:\n   * temas que mencionas pero nunca desarrollas,\n   * preguntas frecuentes que nadie responde,\n   * secciones donde todos tus artículos se repiten. A partir de eso, te genera una lista priorizada de piezas nuevas de contenido que rellenan esos huecos.​\n6. **Intérprete de hojas de cálculo y reportes densos** No solo resume texto: si subes excels/reportes con datos, puedes pedirle que encuentre tendencias, outliers, hipótesis de por qué cambian ciertos números y luego que te lo convierta en “guión para presentación” o speaker notes para una reunión. Es útil cuando los datos ya existen pero nadie tiene tiempo de traducirlos a conclusiones claras.\n7. **Asistente de revisión académica “semi-automatizada”** Para TFG/tesis o papers, puedes subir el documento y pedirle que:\n   * liste todas las referencias citadas y compruebe consistencia de formato,\n   * resuma la metodología en lenguaje llano,\n   * señale lagunas: variables que mencionas pero no mides, hipótesis no probadas o secciones que prometes en la intro pero nunca desarrollas.​\n8. **Historial vivo de reuniones y decisiones** Si subes transcripciones de reuniones (o notas), NotebookLM puede construir una especie de “registro institucional”: quién decidió qué, qué tareas quedaron asignadas y cómo se han ido repitiendo ciertos problemas a lo largo de distintos encuentros. Luego le pides que te genere una línea de tiempo de decisiones clave para onboarding de nuevas personas.​\n9. **Diseñador de sistemas de estudio personalizados** En lugar de solo pedir resúmenes, le puedes decir: “Enséñame este contenido como si fuera un curso de 4 semanas”, con:\n   * objetivos de aprendizaje semanales,\n   * quizzes crecientes en dificultad,\n   * analogías diferentes cada vez que fallas una pregunta. Termina siendo un mini-tutor armado a partir de tus propios materiales.\n10. **Explorador de “versiones alternativas” de un proyecto** Subes todo lo relacionado a un proyecto (brief, correos, bocetos, feedback) y le pides que te genere versiones alternativas:\n\n* “¿Cómo habría sido este proyecto si el objetivo principal fuera X en vez de Y?”\n* “Reescribe el plan como si el presupuesto fuera la mitad / el doble.” Es una forma rápida de hacer escenarios what-if sin rehacer todo a mano.\n\nSi lo ves solo como “un ChatGPT con PDFs”, te pierdes lo interesante. Donde realmente brilla es cuando le das mucho contexto tuyo (años de notas, diarios, proyectos) y le pides que encuentre patrones, huecos y rutas alternativas que tú no verías a simple vista.",

          "text": "Splitting the PDF is a smart move, but relying on it to generate automated notes as your main study method is a tactical error.\nLately, NotebookLM has been struggling with hallucinations in complex formulas and often skips logical steps in mathematical derivations like x(t) and h(t). If you just generate Markdown and read it, you’re engaging in passive learning, which is the number one enemy of engineering students.\nHere is a more robust and efficient high-performance workflow:\n1. Context Preparation (NotebookLM)\nDon't ask it to \"write the notes.\" Use it as a tutor-on-demand.\nSegmentation: Keep dividing by chapters. It helps the AI avoid mixing up Fourier and Laplace transforms prematurely.\nCritical Prompting: Instead of \"summarize this,\" use:\n\"Act as an engineering professor. Explain the concept of [Concept X] using a real-world analogy, then break down the mathematical logic step-by-step, specifically explaining why we transition from an integral to a summation in this context.\"\n2. The \"Black Box\" Method (Active Learning)\nIn Signals and Systems, theory is useless without visual intuition.\nDon't just transcribe: Read a sub-section, then try to draw the block diagram or the impulse response without looking at the book.\nUse NotebookLM for \"Feynman\" checks: Explain a difficult concept to the tool and ask: \"Did I make any conceptual errors in my explanation of convolution? Be critical.\"\n3. Handling Math and Code\nMarkdown is great for text, but for Oppenheim, you need to \"see\" the signal.\nLaTeX for formulas: If you take notes in Markdown, ensure your editor (like Obsidian) supports KaTeX or MathJax.\nSimulation: Don't stop at the paper. Use a small Python script (NumPy/SciPy) to visualize what Oppenheim is describing. Seeing the wave move is worth a thousand notes.\nNotebookLM is a consultation tool, not a replacement for your brain. If you let the AI synthesize the book for you, the knowledge stays in the .md file and not in your head.\nUse it to explain the \"why\" behind the mathematical proofs you don't understand at first glance, but the end-of-chapter problems... those you have to sweat through yourself",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n​I’ve been experimenting with a way to stop relying on \"surface-level\" AI financial advice (which is often outdated or hallucinated) and instead build a custom \"Reasoning Engine\" for specific assets.\n​The goal: Combine live data, institutional expertise, and a \"Bear Case\" stress test into one private knowledge base.\n\n​The Workflow (The \"4-Layer\" System):\n\n​Layer 1: The Pulse (Dynamic) – I use Perplexity/Gemini to scrape live news, Fed meetings, and current price action. This is the \"Now\" layer.\n\n​Layer 2: The Foundation (Structural) – I pull P&L, balance sheets, and intrinsic valuation data from Screener.io or TickerTape.\n\n​Layer 3: The Consensus (Expert) – I find the top institutional PDFs or expert blog transcripts. This is the \"Smart Money\" logic.\n\n​Layer 4: The Friction (Adversarial) – I explicitly hunt for the \"Bear Case\"—short-seller reports or contrarian views to kill my own confirmation bias.\n\n​The Execution:\nI feed all these datasets into NotebookLM. Because NotebookLM is grounded only in the sources I provide, it doesn't hallucinate as much as a standard GPT-5/Claude window.\n\n​The Key Question:\nI’ve been testing this on Silver ETFs lately. By asking the AI to \"compare the Expert Consensus with the Friction layer using the Foundation’s math,\" I’m getting insights that feel way more professional than just Googling \"Is Silver a buy?\"\n​My concern: Is the \"Time-to-Trade\" too high? By the time I curate these 4 layers, am I missing the entry point for swing trades? Or is this the \"Gold Standard\" for long-term fundamental research?\n\n​Would love to hear if anyone else is using NotebookLM for \"Red Teaming\" their investments or if you see a major hole in this logic.\n\n​TL;DR: I’m using a multi-dataset AI workflow to force \"expert\" logic onto \"live\" data.\n\n",

It splits it up into the same sized chunks, right?\n\nI've had apparent success with uploading several dozen 1MB raw text files (server transcripts). But past about 70 sources (now, used to be less) it starts missing some, if I ask it to inventory and give me a list and count. \n\nIts total count still scales up with more sources added. Like about 2/3rds. So not a hard cap on context length. More of a nuanced issue with the RAG system, I think. It can still report info from sources if claims not to see, oddly.",

It turns out gemini has a massive context window of 1 million tokens (larger than claude's 200k) - however it is limited in the \"chatbot\" form to where it will skim material you hand it.  If you go into AI studio you essentially have an \"untethered\" version of the model where you can adjust parameters to your liking.\n\nI have just started doing this but set temperature to 0, media resolution to high, thinking level to high, activate code execution, and give a good prompt.\n\nIn addition - there is a limit of 10mb you can hand it of files on the front (dropping to the chat window) so you must deliver these around the \"back\" (google drive) - otherwise it won't work.  This is another thing that makes it superior to claude because claude limits you to 31mb at a time.\n\nI have cancelled my claude sub as of now but the real test for me will be when i have my next open-note exam.  If it isn't able to make as good of a study guide as claude I will just go back to claude.\n\nedit: edited some stuff\n\n  \nedit2: Coming back to this comment...I found you actually need to build a full application to achieve this.  It needs to use API for this to work unfortunately.  But if you use gemini pro that shouldn't be much of a problem.  Claude may be a better option just due to ease of use.",

Thytus lets you send off agents that can gather the info and write the report. It’s pretty accurate because the agents can talk to and work with each other so less hallucinations.",

One thing that’s helped me a lot is using tools that build a persistent**,** structured knowledge base behind the scenes so the AI can remember and reason over your docs instead of just regurgitating the last chunk you pasted.\n\nFor example, tools like Implicit let you upload all your sources (PDFs, notes, long docs, etc.) and it will turn them into an AI-powered knowledge engine that\n\n* builds a living graph of your content that stays coherent across sessions\n* gives you sourced, traceable answers based on your actual material, not just prompt context\n* helps you generate structured pieces (summaries, outlines, drafts) knowing the whole picture instead of the last <3 k words\n\nThat’s been a game-changer for keeping continuity in longer projects, you can try it for free up to 50 sources I believe.\n\nHere's the link!

          "text": "I can’t speak specifically about it as a medical student but I can tell you how I use it as an attending working on a masters in medical education and you can maybe extrapolate. \n\nThe first thing is uploading your sources in a good way but then I have a conversation. It starts as “give me a summary of this chapter in depth enough to master the material.” This gets me a document I save to read and reference. Then I read that document and have a conversation. Notebook LM also links to Gemini (I pay for it). If I need more depth, I upload the notebook to Gemini and just ask. \n\nAn example for work would be uploading a couple review articles on pediatric fever of unknown origin (I am in PEM). Then I use the notebook LM to search for new articles in depth and prompt it so it only pulls from pubmed and established guidelines. Then I ask notebook LM to get me the highest impact articles as it only pulls the abstracts and I get 5 biggest full articles. That gives me my foundation of “give me a document giving me the most up to date stuff on this topic.” I read through that document and come across something I don’t understand. “Fever of unknown origin is for >8 days with negative prior workup.” I ask LM chat my questions. What exactly qualifies in the literature as “negative prior workup?” What if no workup has been done? Does fever, cough, and congestion qualify as “fever of unknown origin” at 8 days? I do this until I feel comfortable with the topic. I also use it to create Anki cards if I want.\n\nI do this with medical stuff that I want grounded. I use Gemini when it is less important. For class, I am taking a medical assessment class right now and it is going into statistics. I upload the chapters I need to notebook LM and sometimes link the notebook to Gemini to ask questions. “What is the actual use for Cronbach’s alpha? Give me a pediatric emergency medicine example so I can grasp it better.”\n\nOther ways I use them both is put things in easier ways. I was having a hard time explaining DKA to patients in parents so I had them help me with an example of how it works with locked doors and keys. This is probably a very valuable way to convert the material into something you can easily grasp. At least to lay that foundation.",

Eso fuerza el *active recall*, que es clave en medicina.​​\n5. **Convierte clases largas en algo digerible**\n   * Para clases eternas, sube el PDF y pídele un resumen por objetivos o por learning outcomes (“resume cada diapositiva en una frase y luego arma un esquema general”).\n   * Si tienes acceso a audio o video de clases, NotebookLM puede generar resúmenes o incluso audio tipo podcast para repasar mientras viajas.​​\n6. **Organiza y revisa de forma constante, no solo antes del parcial**\n   * Cada semana, sube el material nuevo al cuaderno del ramo y pídele a NotebookLM que actualice un “documento de briefing” o un “study guide” con lo nuevo.\n   * Así, cuando se acerca el examen, ya tienes resúmenes curados y no empiezas desde cero.\n7. **No dejes que reemplace el criterio médico ni los libros**\n   * NotebookLM es brutal para ordenar, resumir y preguntarte sobre lo que tú mismo subiste, pero no es un sustituto de textos de referencia ni de las clases.\n   * Para temas sensibles (dosis, guías de manejo, protocolos de urgencias) revisa siempre el libro, las guías oficiales o las recomendaciones de tus docentes",

It's a great public resource where they compiled expert insights, financial evaluations, and market guides into a single NotebookLM link.\n\nHere is the example I'm talking about:[https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/b3fd7608-7daa-48ef-8b35-88e9df63c73f](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/b3fd7608-7daa-48ef-8b35-88e9df63c73f)\n\nI'm currently researching similar use cases. Are there any other public, high-quality, or \"featured\" notebooks created by brands, experts, or even individuals that you know of?\n\nI would really appreciate it if you could share any links or examples you have. Thanks in advance!",

We have been pitching this to clients as part of their content strategy (i.e. develop a college planning notebook for parents and/or students, notebooks for trip planning, etc). No takers yet, but if you are advertising with Google and are a known brand or publisher, develop a good notebook, contact your rep, and see if they will promote it. No brainer to do this and promote to non-NotebookLM users. Can you imagine a fully loaded college planning notebooklm or SAT prep notebooklm (loaded) sponsored by an education brand? No brainer.",
