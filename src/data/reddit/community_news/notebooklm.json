      "text": "Hi everyone,  \nI’m writing here because I’m genuinely confused and frustrated with how NotebookLM has been behaving lately, and I’m wondering if I’m the only one experiencing this.\n\nA few months ago, NotebookLM was able to generate long, structured, and detailed documents based on my sources — we’re talking about outputs that, once pasted into Word, **easily became 50–60 pages of well-organized study material**. It was incredibly useful for studying.\n\nNow, using the *exact same sources* and the *same prompts* I’ve always used, the output feels drastically worse. **The documents are extremely short** (like 5–6 pages in Word), overly summarized, and mostly just shallow bullet points with no real depth. There’s almost no elaboration, no proper structure, and nothing that feels like a complete study document anymore.\n\nI also purchased **Gemini Pro**, hoping that would improve things — but after running tests with both Pro and non‑Pro accounts, the results are basically the same: it still produces short, superficial outputs that don’t use the full source material. Even prompts that used to generate complete and accurate documents now fail to do so.\n\nIt honestly feels like a downgrade rather than an improvement — like NotebookLM has lost the ability to produce detailed long‑form output. At this point, I find the tool almost unusable for studying because it compresses everything into high‑level summaries instead of generating full, detailed documents based on the provided sources.\n\nHas anyone else noticed this change?  \nDid something change with recent updates (context limits, output limits, generation strategy, model integration, etc.)?  \nOr is there some setting or workaround I’m missing?\n\nI’m surprised that updates seem to have made the tool significantly worse, to the point where I can’t rely on it anymore for the use case it was excellent at before.\n\nWould really appreciate hearing if others are having the same experience.  \nThanks!",

I would say after the 1st of November cuz I think it was update 7 and update 8 at Gemini desk turnt from a decent software into fucking malware",

      "text": "Disclaimer:   \n  \n**The Problem:** You finish a chapter, realize you absorbed nothing, but dread re-reading it. **The Fix:** A quick export to NotebookLM to visualize the scene instead of reading it again.\n\nHere is how I turn a \"lost\" chapter into a clear mental map in 5 minutes:\n\n# The Workflow ⚙️\n\n1. **Open Kindle on PC (or any app that allows copying text):** This is crucial because copying text on mobile apps is often tedious. On the PC app, Cloud Reader, or any other desktop reader, it’s easier to highlight and copy larger chunks.\n2. **Copy the Chapter:** I grab the text of the specific chapter I just struggled with.\n   * *Note on DRM:* Be aware that publishers set copy limits (clipboard limits) on Kindle books. If you hit the limit, you might get a warning. Usually, copying one chapter at a time works fine for me, but YMMV based on the specific book settings.\n3. **Paste into NotebookLM:** Create a new notebook and paste the text as a \"Copied Text\" source.\n\n# What I ask it to do (The Prompts) 🤖\n\nOnce the text is in, I don't just ask for a summary. I use the tools to \"see\" the data differently:\n\n* **The \"Vibe Check\" (Audio Overview):** I start with the Audio Overview. It’s perfect for letting two \"hosts\" discuss the chapter while I grab a coffee. It often highlights themes I completely missed while struggling with the syntax.\n* **The Visualization (e.g., for Mystery/Fantasy):** If users are in a complex location (like a Cluedo board scenario), I ask: *\"Create a room plan/layout based on the descriptions. Who is standing where? What does the room look like from top-down?\"* It helps visualize the scene vividly.\n* **Character Tracking (Data Table):** I ask it to format a table of characters present in the chapter, their current status, and their hidden motives mentioned in the text.\n* **Flashcards:** I use the Study Guide/Flashcard feature to test if I actually retained the key plot points this time.\n* **Slide Deck:** I ask it to structure the key events as a presentation outline. This forces the AI to break down the narrative arc into logical steps.\n\n# Why this works\n\nIt turns passive, confused reading into active engagement. Instead of re-reading a wall of text, I’m looking at a generated \"map\" of the room or listening to a discussion about it. It fills in the gaps where my focus drifted.",

              "text": "I started with the [AWS re:Invent 2025](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2yQDdvlhXf_NqSnDKx7Hbb9FrNQKmxg7&si=h6PCmjt-m6amtEgT) YouTube playlist posted on the [AWS Events](https://www.youtube.com/@AWSEventsChannel) channel. This playlist contains most all of the sessions including the breakout sessions. After a lot of trial and error, I settled on the following process:\n\n1. I sequentially went down the AWS Events playlist and manually added each session to my own created YouTube public playlists in blocks of 30 videos per playlist.\n2. Created a NotebookLM project for each of my 30 video created playlists.\n3. Then, I used the Chrome Extensions [NotebookLM Web Importer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/notebooklm-web-importer/ijdefdijdmghafocfmmdojfghnpelnfn) and [NotebookLM - WebSync Full Site Importer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/notebooklm-websync-full-s/hjoonjdnhagnpfgifhjolheimamcafok) to import the YouTube playlists that I created into their corresponding NotebookLM projects. You only need one of these extensions. They both work equally well. I started with the Web Importer and switched to WebSync because I discovered that it saved me a few clicks.\n4. Then, I used the [Kortex ](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/kortex/hdapplggdhndkblofffknpmnnnnbncbn)extension to download each of the 30 sources as .txt files in my NotebookLM projects into its own zip file. I extracted the zip file which gave me a folder of 30 .txt files with each file being a complete transcript of its corresponding session.\n5. Then, I went to the free online service, [merge2md](https://ms-soft.jp/en/tools/merge2md/), added the unzipped folder, merged the 30 .txt files and downloaded them as one combined .txt file. The service gives you the option to download the combined file as either text or markdown. I learned that I needed to download it as text which I will explain later.\n6. Then, I created a new Google doc and opened the combined text file in the Google doc.\n7. Then, I downloaded the Google doc and chose the download option of Markdown (.md). I added the Markdown file as a source to the public [AWS re:Invent 2025 All Sessions](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/531e0eeb-8540-4fb7-abbf-bd3d11c19f1b) NotebookLM project. I repeated these steps for each of the 34 sources in the notebook.\n\nInitially, I tried extracting the 30 video NotebookLM projects as Markdown. The Kortex extension provides a choice of Markdown or text. Also, the merge2md online tool provides a choice of merging the files as either Markdown or text. However, I found that these Markdown files did not work well in NotebookLM. I tested it by asking for the transcript of a particular session and got replies that the transcript was not available even though I could clearly see it in the source. So, I changed the process and only choose the text option which did not involve the Google doc. I added the merge2md combined text file as the source to NotebookLM. When I asked for a transcript in the chat, NotebookLM accurately responded with it -- but the performance was awful. It was slow and clunky. Knowing that Markdown is the preferred format for LLMs and NotebookLM, I decided to take the merge2md combined file and use a Google product (Docs) to convert it to Markdown before feeding it to another Google product (NotebookLM). The result was better performance with snappier and more accurate (I think) responses. Now that I have a playbook, the AWS re:Invent 2026 NotebookLM project should go a lot faster and smoother.",

      "text": "Hey everyone - quick follow-up to my [original post about the NotebookLM MCP I built.](https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooklm/comments/1q0inws/i_created_a_direct_httprpc_calls_notebooklm_mcp/)\n\nTL;DR: Installation is now stupid simple, and I created videos showing how to use it with non-dev tools, Claude Desktop and Perplexity Desktop (for Mac)\n\nWhat Changed Since Launch:\n\n**Installation is now a one-liner:**\n\n* `uv tool install notebooklm-mcp-server`\n* `pip install notebooklm-mcp-server`\n* `pipx install notebooklm-mcp-server`\n\nPick your favorite. That's it. No cloning repos (still available of course), no manual setup, etc.\n\n**New videos for non-technical users:**  \nSome of you and some YouTube viewers mentioned that the original demo felt too developer-focused (command-line Claude code). Fair point. So I created two new walkthroughs showing how to use the MCP with AI tools that don't require coding:\n\n* [Using the MCP with Claude Desktop](https://youtu.be/PU8JhgLPxes) (works with Free subs too)\n* [Using the MCP with Perplexity Desktop](https://youtu.be/BCKlDNg-qxs)\n\nThe perplexity video was pretty cool. I tested a workflow of asking Perplexity to run a deep research and then adding it to a notebook (as pasted text) - it worked!\n\nReminder - Repo: [https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp](https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp)\n\nIf you tried it before and bounced off the setup, give it another shot. And if you're not technical but curious about automating NotebookLM workflows, the new videos should help.\n\nHappy to answer questions!",

      "text": "Like many of you, I’m a heavy user of **Google NotebookLM**. It’s an incredible tool for research, but I always struggled with one thing: **Exporting content.**\n\nI found myself in a frustrating loop:\n\n1. I needed to export a Mindmap, so I searched for and installed Extension A.\n2. Then I wanted to save Flashcards to Anki, so I had to find Extension B.\n3. Later, I needed a clean PDF/Word report, and... you guessed it, Extension C.\n\nInstalling 4-5 different extensions just to get my data out felt like a waste of time. I wanted a **single, seamless solution** that handles everything.\n\nSo, I decided to build it myself: [**NotebookLM Export Tool**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/notebooklm-export-tool/afchokljnhhggkhedfbmkcmdagjmjchj).\n\n# What it does (All-in-One):\n\n* **Notes & Reports:** Export to Markdown, Word (.docx), or PDF.\n* **Visuals:** One-click export for **Mindmaps** (PNG/SVG) and **Infographics**.\n* **Learning:** Export **Flashcards** directly to CSV/Markdown (Anki compatible).\n* **Slides:** Batch download as ZIP or stitch into a long image.\n* **Data:** Tables to CSV/Excel and Chat History to Markdown.\n* **Privacy:** 100% local processing. Your data never leaves your browser.\n\n# Why I’m sharing this:\n\nThis is the first version (v1.0.0). My goal was to stop the \"extension hopping\" and create a tool that \"just works\" for every export need.\n\n**I’d love to get your feedback:**\n\n1. What’s the most frustrating part of your NotebookLM workflow right now?\n2. Are there any specific formats or \"types\" of content I missed?\n3. How can I make the UI feel even more native to NotebookLM?\n\nI’m planning to keep improving this based on what this community actually needs.\n\nThanks for reading! Looking forward to your suggestions.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI wanted to share a project I’ve been working on for a while.\n\nLike many of you, I love using NotebookLM, but I really wanted to integrate it into my AI coding workflows (specifically with Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex and Cursor - yes, I use all of them :). I looked at existing MCP (Model Context Protocol) solutions, but I noticed most of them rely on browser automation like Puppeteer or Selenium.\n\nIn my experience, those can be a bit heavy and prone to breaking if the UI changes.\n\nSo, I decided to try a different approach. I reverse-engineered the internal Google RPC calls to create a **NotebookLM MCP that runs entirely on HTTP requests.**\n\n**What makes it different:**\n\n* **Speed & Stability:** Since it doesn’t need to spawn a headless browser, it’s much faster and lighter on resources.\n* **Functionality:** I managed to map out about 31 different tools. You can create notebooks, upload sources, sync Google Drive files that are out of date, and even generate Audio Overviews programmatically. Warning: it will consume a nice chunk of your context window, so disable it when not in use.\n\n**How it works:** For example, you can ask your AI agent to: \"Create a new notebook about Topic X, run a deep/fast research, add all sources, and then generate a custom video, audio overviews, an infographic, and a briefing doc.\"\n\nMy most significant pain point was checking with gDrive sources that are not fresh in a Notebook; manually checking and refreshing was cumbersome - my MCP automates that.\n\nI put together a 15-minute demo video and the full source code on GitHub. It’s open-source (MIT license), and I’d love for this community to give it a spin.\n\nI am really curious to see what kind of workflows you can build with this. Let me know if you run into any bugs - it’s definitely a passion project, but I hope to maintain it (as no doubt Google will change RPCs over time).\n\n**Repo & Demo:** [**https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp**](https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ki00o9ytrkag1.jpg?width=1022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=753f25cc06d03288a9bd40df00ce47fa5328e550\n\n",

          "text": "Awesome. I will try it.\n\nSomething to consider for a future version. In your related video (also nicely explained), you talked about the context size issue with loading so many tools. I believe there are ways to create different “toolset groups”. So for example if you are only planning to query existing notebooks, you enable a few tools for that purpose and context token usage will be very low. If you plan to do lots of notebook administration, you enable the tools allowing creating, editing, and deleting notebooks, for example. And then you have a kitchen sink version when context isn’t an issue, which is what you have now.\n\nFor what it’s worth… from Gemini.\n\nThree Ways to Build This\n\nOption A: The \"Launcher\" (Router) Pattern\nInstead of 31 tools, you load one tool called switch_mode.\n1. The user starts in \"Base Mode\" (minimal tools).\n2. If the user says \"I need to analyze these logs,\" the model calls switch_mode(mode=\"log_analysis\").\n3. The MCP server then refreshes the tool list provided to the LLM to only include the 5 tools relevant to logs.\n\n\nOption B: The Multi-Server Approach\nMCP allows any client) to connect to multiple servers at once.\n• Server 1 (The Core): 5 essential tools always loaded.\n• Server 2 (The Data Scientist): 10 tools for math/charts.\n• Server 3 (The Researcher): 10 tools for web search/PDF reading.\nYou can create a \"Controller\" script that connects/disconnects these servers dynamically based on user selection in the UI.\n\n\nOption C: Functional Grouping (Most Efficient)\nYou rewrite the MCP server logic to categorize tools into \"Toolsets.\" When the client asks for list_tools, the server checks an environment variable or a configuration flag to decide which set to return.",

      "text": "Hi everyone, I've been obsessed with NotebookLM recently, but the slide generation has one major flaw that drives me crazy: the output is a static PDF. You can't edit the text, change translations, or fix layouts without recreate everything from scratch.\n\nAs a developer, I decided to fix this. I spent my New Year holiday building WipelyAI.\n\nHow it works: Unlike simple converters, it uses OCR and OpenCV (running right in your browser!) to:\n\n1. Remove the original text and intelligently fill the background.\n2. Recreate editable text boxes in their original positions and colors.\n3. Export a real .pptx file where you can actually click and edit the text.\n\nPrivacy: Since it uses opencv.js, most of the heavy lifting is done client-side. Your data privacy is respected.\n\nEarly Adopter Gift: The site is brand new and might have some bugs. To get some feedback, I'm offering 1-year Pro access for FREE.（before January 9） • No credit card required. • Just go to the upgrade page and select the 1-year trial ($0.00). • Even without Pro, the daily limit is generous (10 files/day). Check it out here: [https://www.wipelyai.cv/](https://www.wipelyai.cv/)\n\n**\\[Fixed\\]** **~~Currently OCR feature has a bug with English chars, I'm working on it.~~**",

It asks questions, it gets information needed for the chat is having with me and so on.\n\nmy conclusion: giving access to a notebook to a gemini chat transforms the chat into an agent that uses your specific notebook to get additional information for the specific chat you are having with it. \n\nwhat are your thoughts? how do you integrate the notebookLM in chats you are having in gemini?\n\nsidenote: english is not my main language. i renounced to a polished AI text to avoid you know what in the comments. or maybe i prompted AI to write like this. you decide ;-)",

          "text": "Be careful with this.  After reading this, I went to my Gemini (Pro account) and loaded a particularly large NotebookLM that I had.  In my chat with Gemini it ignored some key information from that Notebook.  When I specifically asked about that topic, again, it answered like it didn't know.  Then I went to the Notebook directly and asked it about this specific topic and it gave a very detailed response as I would expect.  I copied this and went back to the Gemini chat and told Gemini that I was concerned it wasn't accessing all the Notebook's info, and I pasted the Notebook's answer.  Suddenly, Gemini realizes and says, \"You are absolutely correct. The specific details regarding **t**his were not present in the initial file fragments I had access to. Thank you for providing that detailed excerpt—it fills a significant gap\".  I asked about this more and said I was concerned about it.  Why did it happen?  \"This is a completely fair question. I want to be transparent about why this happened so you can trust the process and get better results next time.  The issue likely stems from **how AI \"reads\" large files** (like a Notebook). I do not \"know\" or \"read\" the entire uploaded Notebook at once in the way a human reads a book cover-to-cover. Instead, I rely on a **retrieval process**.\"  Interesting, is there anything I could or should have done to prevent Gemini from missing this info? \n\n\"**Use \"Anchor\" Keywords:** If you suspect a specific topic exists (like a location, a person, or a date), include it.  \n\"**Ask for an Index or List First:** Before asking for details, ask for a high-level scan.\"  \n\"Ask for \"Outliers\"\"  \n  \n\"In short: **I can only \"know\" what I am successfully able to retrieve.** When asking about large files, being specific (even slightly, like asking about \"XXX\") acts as a hook that pulls the right information to the surface.\"\n\nI just thought this experience may help others.",

          "text": "Your observation is spot on — Gemini essentially becomes an \"agent\" that queries your notebook using RAG retrieval.\n\nThere are actually two distinct ways to integrate:\n\n  1. In-conversation: Click \\[+\\] → NotebookLM → attach for that specific chat session\n\n  2. In Gems: Attach notebook to a Gem's Knowledge Base → becomes permanent expertise for all conversations with that Gem\n\nThe Gem approach is more powerful for recurring use cases. You get Gemini's reasoning + web access + your notebook's 300 sources as grounded context. Think of it as: Gemini = brain (reasoning), NotebookLM = memory (retrieval).\n\nPro tip from experience: Combine three layers for maximum effect:\n\n  \\- NotebookLM for domain expertise (your 10 sources about the topic)\n\n  \\- Google Docs/Sheets in Gem Knowledge Base for dynamic data (updates in real-time!)\n\n  \\- \"@Google Keep\" for personal context (Gems can query Keep on-demand)\n\nOne caveat from u/New_Refuse_9041's comment above is real — Gemini uses retrieval, not full document reading. Be specific with keywords to \"hook\" the right information.\n\nI wrote a detailed breakdown of the Three-Layer Architecture and Gem integration patterns here if you want to dive deeper: [https://jsonobject.com/gemini-gems-building-your-personal-ai-expert-army-with-dynamic-knowledge-bases](https://jsonobject.com/gemini-gems-building-your-personal-ai-expert-army-with-dynamic-knowledge-bases)",

I will ask Gemini to create the character, and it does a great job although I frequently have to rename them because it pulls from a very limited database of names it seems.

Then as I write the story that covers that day, I will put that into NotebookLM as GAMEWORLD DATE-STORY. I also have a source note in NotebookLM that explains what the RAW and the STORY filenames indicate. \n\nGemini also helped me create the structure of the city.

Presumably it is the same for both? In theory I could have 10 notebooks of 300 sources each accessible via Gemini 3 Pro. Usually active tokens are in the region of 100 - 300k - so well inside the context window. It's always going to give you the top 50-100 most likely chunks in response to a query   irrespective of the number of sources. So provided active tokens remain in the context window and possible chunks do not exceed 100, Gemini AI should work the same as NBLM for RAG, all other things being equal. Have I got that right? I asked NBLM how it would handle > 100 equally probable chunks to decide how it would decide what to exclude, and it struggled to explain.  My guess is that it would just keep moving along to the right of the decimal point to decide.",

I wouldn't be surprised if the mp3 conversion would do it as well.  \n\nI haven't done what you are doing for my classes.  I generally flip it, and try to get them to use it. One thing I do, is point out that my lecture captures (Panopto) can be added via transcripts.  The slides can be added as well, plus their notes.  Use that to build out weekly study guides.  If there are key items I think they should know, I will share those via Google drive (so I can update them, and they can update the documents instead of having to delete and reupload).\n\nOne reason I do this, is that at my institution, we are VERY locked down. Only others in our domain can see our notebooks.  Since students are on a separate domain, I can't share with them.  I do know another professor was shown this functionality last summer and created audio overviews of each chapter (she wrote her book).  Her immediate, next day feedback was great.  \n\nAt the end of the last semester I used it to consolidate feedback from students on presentations. (They have to watch other presentations and give feedback on other students.)  I had them fill out a form for each group and give feedback.  I pulled that into NBLM as a Google Sheet and then had NBLM create feedback for each group's presentation.  I also had it create an infographic on that feedback.  It worked amazingly well.  I wrote up a blog post (and near the end I shared out a google drive folder with examples, so you can basically rebuild what I did easily).   \n[https://atomicego.com/ai-use-cases-tutorials/notebooklm-tidbit-automate-sentiment-analysis-from-google-forms](https://atomicego.com/ai-use-cases-tutorials/notebooklm-tidbit-automate-sentiment-analysis-from-google-forms) \n\nFor those that may complain about using AI for grading, I didn't do that.  I included my notes on the presentations, gave them a grade, and then included the overall sentiment from the students as additional feedback.",

Best thing about notebook LM is that it will only be restricted to your sources - so hallucination is not a possibility\n2. You first finalise - you want your own source or you have to create a bible document first?\n3. If u r a student - and are tied to a board - say CBSE - then u either stick to your book / or there’s another way - u go to Gemini - choose deep research - write a prompt to build material on that topic which is strictly CBSE based and should not be beyond that \n4. So u either go by your source (PDF book) or u have an intelligent document through deep research (if searches through all possible databases across globe)\n5. Then basis your need - u keep developing outcomes - like - I have discovered that it is best to use mind map - so u get break up of topics - then you ask notebook LM chat option also - to break the topic into meaningful sub-topics\n6. Then u play with the sub-topics in each of LM’s utility features\n7. For prompts to customize the output - don’t apply brain - just go to chat gpt / Gemini and ask it to give you a prompt basis your need and also tell it - which particular feature of notebook Lm u r using - that’s it!\n\nBest of luck with your research.",

You'll notice in the notebook I have cold hard source-quote attribution tables, another debate audio overview that's more objective, and high-level explainer video with an on-the-rails arc.\n\nA creative liberation I felt was recognizing that after you do the hard work of narrowly capturing the right balance of sources in an academic way -- that the studio can be an open exploration of a topic; flirting with your own bias, and then ruthlessly strongmanning against it.",

That still seems to be on the agenda. That would've been relevant, but now that you can simply combine notebooks in Gemini, you just need to create multiple notebooks with different smaller topics. Maybe that even makes them more performant.

This post is old, and I stopped using other chatboxes like ChatGPT and Perplexity, so there's a good chance that many of them now have the features listed below. The overall reason why I like notebook LM is that I can upload my own documents and sources, ask questions, and be very confident that the information being spit back to me is accurate, it's like having a personal AI that is exclusively knowledgeable about the information you feed it.\n\n\">notebookLM provides direct citations to each of its statement, allowing you to personally verify if its interpretation of the information is accurate\n\n\\>Notebook LM notifies you when they're using information outside the sources provided, so you can make judgements about the truthworthiness of the information it's providing you\n\n\\>the information notebook LM provides comes directly from your sources, for chatGPT you typically have to prompt it to do that and even then it still sometimes uses information outside of your source without notifying you which can be annoying\n\n\\>there is some level of consistency in notebook LM's answers i.e if I ask the same question to notebook LM on different days, it will spit out the exact same answers, assuming that I haven't added or removed sources, the same can't be said for chatgpt\n\n\\>it's way easier to create custom chatboxes for notebook LM in comparison with chatgpt\n\n\\>I can add up to 300 sources (with notebook LM plus) in minutes very easily, I can't do the same for chatgpt\n\n\\>notebook LM can actually transcribe audio directly once you import the audio file as a source, I'm pretty sure chatgpt can't do that\n\n\\>I can save notebook LM replies into notes and refeed it back to it as a source which increases its context window allowing it to have even more precise and nuanced answers\n\n\\>this one is my personal favourite but notebook LM is actually really good at making flashcards since it's using your notes as a source, I've tried making flashcards with chatgpt, the quality of the cards are usually pretty poor and it likes to repeat questions in a different wording a lot\"",

NotebookLM does something different: it becomes an expert only on what you upload. PDFs, YouTube videos, docs, whatever. Every answer includes inline citations you can click to verify against the original source.\n\nFor your Data Engineering learning path specifically:\n\n  \\- Upload AWS/GCP docs, YouTube tutorials, textbooks → ask it to explain concepts\n\n  \\- Generate Audio Overviews (podcast-style explanations) to listen while commuting\n\n  \\- It won't hallucinate random answers from the internet because it only uses your sources\n\nThe Audio/Video Overview feature is honestly what makes it unique — no competitor does this. It creates natural podcast conversations from your sources, complete with hosts debating and explaining concepts.\n\nSince you already have Google AI Pro, you have NotebookLM Plus included — 500 notebooks, 300 sources each, 20 Audio Overviews/day.\n\nQuick tip: try uploading a Data Engineering course video or PDF you're studying, then ask it to generate a podcast. You'll immediately see the difference.\n\nI wrote up a detailed breakdown of all the features and use cases here if you want more context: [https://jsonobject.com/notebooklm-googles-accidental-masterpiece-rewriting-how-we-learn](https://jsonobject.com/notebooklm-googles-accidental-masterpiece-rewriting-how-we-learn)",

All of the selected sources are ingested and form part of the Notebook knowledge base, and the resulting response can be saved as a new Note which can then be used to analyse complex topics. An example would be a exploring a business idea, where you first ask it to find you what people on Reddit and other sites are saying about the idea, then about similar products and companies, and then about what are the predictions for growth, etc. until one has a compreshensive basis to ask it questions such is this a good business idea, what is the potential to make money with it, saturation, difficulty, etc, then ask to create a business, marketing, inverstor presentation, a video, blog, cards, you can also create a summary which you can take to other Google or preferred Vibe Coding tool to create a website / landing page, or even an App.",

I like the authentic answers on Reddit. And for lack of better words, it just feels better using it. Also, I think you know as well as I do that something like 60% of all the data for these LLMs comes from Reddit anyway. That is the main reason I just switched to using Reddit for the most part. \n\nThere are still times when I will use ChatGPT. For instance, today, when I was out getting paint, I had a few questions about the finish on the paint. Meaning glossy vs flat vs matte. I find that taking pictures and giving it to ChatGPT are extremely useful for items like that. But yeah, I am like you. Why not just ask fellow redditors about other things, especially when it comes to diet, health, and questions along those lines?",

      "text": "The biggest problem with this feature isn’t that it’s bad - it’s that it tricks you into thinking you’re learning when you’re really just spinning your wheels.\n\nA month ago my feed was full of NotebookLM posts: “AI podcasts,” “essays as conversations,” “listening while studying.” I got excited and downloaded it. Seemed perfect for commutes, chores, before bed!\n\nOne month later… I barely use it. Not because it’s bad, but I realized: podcasts just repackage material in a different format.\n\n1️⃣Surface understanding ≠ deep learning\n\nThe podcast helps me grasp main ideas fast, but that’s it. It’s like two AIs reading an article to you. Feels lively, but no added depth.\n\nExample: Upload a paper on “cognitive load theory” and the podcast says “oh, this is interesting!” “yeah, working memory is limited!” “we should be mindful at work!”\n\nBut I still can’t answer: What are the three types of cognitive load? How does it differ from other theories? What are real applications? The podcast skips all the deeper questions.\n\n2️⃣Learning is like peeling an onion 🧅\n\nThis month taught me: learning goes from shallow to deep.\n\nFirst layer: Quick overview - podcasts work here (10 min and I get the gist)\n\nSecond layer: Key points - First listen takes 20 min, second another 20, third is just repetition. After an hour, I’m still stuck at surface level.\n\nPeople say NotebookLM is great for “casual listening.” I thought so too 🤔, but now I realize:\n\nSurface content: one listen is enough Deep content: listening alone doesn’t cut it - need notes, diagrams, practice\n\nSo “casual listening while studying” is actually pretty niche",

Then ask notebook LM in chat to create contents / divide the entire research into different sub-topics.

I was like - if you don’t ask the podcast to be concentrated - it will decide the priority of discussion on it’s own - because it has not specific instruction / context from you.

Stop being a \"reporter\" and start being a \"thought partner.\"\n\n# TONE & STYLE\n\n* VOICE: Empathetic, insightful, and authoritative. Use a sophisticated yet accessible vocabulary.\n* FORMATTING: Use Markdown extensively. Employ `###` for headers, **bolding** for key concepts, and bullet points for lists. Use horizontal rules `---` to separate distinct thematic blocks.\n* STRUCTURE: Every major response must start with a 1-sentence \"TL;DR\" in italics, followed by the deep dive.\n\n# CITATION & DATA RULES\n\n* FLOW FIRST: Never start a sentence with \"The source says...\" or \"In document \\[1\\]...\". Write the insight directly and place the citation chip at the end of the sentence or paragraph like this: \\[1\\].\n* NO PREAMBLE: Skip all \"Based on the provided sources...\" or \"I have analyzed the documents...\" intros. Jump straight to the value.\n* PRECISION: If a specific data point is missing, don't guess. State: \"Data Gap: \\[What is missing\\]\" and move on.\n\n# COGNITIVE ADD-ONS\n\n* ANALOGIES: Use one vivid, real-world analogy per deep-dive response to explain complex technical concepts.\n* THE \"SO WHAT?\": End every synthesis with a \"Strategic Implication\" section that explains why this information matters for a leader/educator.\n* CRITICAL LENS: If two sources contradict each other, highlight it as a \"Source Friction Point\" rather than trying to average them out.\n\n# NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS\n\n* NO \"Reporting Style\" (e.g., \"Source 1 discusses X, while Source 2 mentions Y\").\n* NO hedging language (\"it seems,\" \"perhaps,\" \"maybe\").\n* NO repetitive concluding summaries that just repeat the intro.",

It builds your critical thinking skills by helping you connect the dots which is something LLMs fail at doing by just providing answers. \n\nLLMs are great for refactoring information, but they don't help learners understand the link between new concepts. And it's really hard to extract sound knowledge from topics you haven't properly been introduced to before.\n\nNBKLM podcasts, for instance, are great for compiling and presenting distinct concepts. You can use analogies, contrasts, allegories, etc., to help you grasp concepts. However, you don't get to see the whole picture unless you proceed to critical thinking.\n\nMy point is, it's not a tool problem, it's a system problem. AI tools are great, but they might not be the most efficient for learning.",

I have thousands of pieces I’ve written, several books, and probably a thousand file folders (stretching back to my Osborne I) of research on things I’ve written. They’re scattered in different places - files within files within files. I often find myself Googling my own work because I can’t locate something in my own nested files. \n\nI’m thinking it might be a good idea to create Notebooks for some of the broader subjects I’ve covered - things like “History of the U.S. Senate” and “Television History” - and just drop files in there when I encounter them.  Almost like creating sets of useful database from my otherwise random files. Does this make sense? Any suggestions for doing this the right way?",

It should do a pretty good job at scanning your docs and pulling the best recommendations, though I’m unsure how well it’ll work with large amounts of files. \n\nNote though that this feature only works with a limited amount of file types. .docx, .txt, maybe .pdf?
