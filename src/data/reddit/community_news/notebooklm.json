Completeness is decent, but the style and layout often drift from the original.  \n\n\nQuestion 2. Very limited visual styles  \nThe default NotebookLM slides feel quite template-ish.  \nI’ve experimented with prompt-based style hints and documented some of them here:  \n[https://github.com/serenakeyitan/awesome-notebookLM-prompts](https://github.com/serenakeyitan/awesome-notebookLM-prompts)\n\n  \nCurious if people have found a better or more sustainable workflow?",

It's so straightforward it feels like a hack.\n\nI teach high school science, use NBLM for creating slide decks for whole chapters or more narrowly hard-to-underatand sections. Infographics make awesome visual review tools. From NBLM on your PC, download/save to your local GDrive file directory tree. Open GDrive app on your tablet, select the saved PDF, select \"send to\" and choose the SNote app. It'll conveniently ask you if you want to create a new Note file or append to one that already exists. Boom, now the NBLM PDF is on your tablet in SNote.\n\nHand edit as desired using stylus and pens, or type over, or copy-paste graphics like rectangles that match the background colors to \"blank out\" things you don't want to see like watermarks or misspellings. (Teacher tip: \"send to\" the SNote app your empty or incomplete notes, then teach from your tablet wirelessly projecting as you add/complete the notes live on-screen; helps engagement during note sessions).\n\nWhen finished editing, click the share icon and you're presented with a selection of like a dozen different export formats from individual images per slide, or our fav PDF, and others you may find useful. Then for destination app you select GDrive. Select the original file name to overwrite if you like or give a new name for new version. Set the destination directory and boom, you're done. Back to your PC for new work in NBLM.\n\nThe SNote app has always been a great sleeper of an app for teachers who know how to use it. All I had to do was purchase a $30 wireless adapter dongle, plug into the projector or smartboard HDMI input. Game changer.",

All the other elements were exactly the same as the original snip.\n\nWhat I found when generating presentation slides, be specific what you want it to produce by editing the prompt inside the presentation tool.\n\nIt does a phenomenal job.

Split+v2 achieves 64% more than MD-All and 28% more than PDF-All.*\n\n# Key Finding 1: Relevance Scores Vary by Configuration\n\nFor the same search term, different notebook setups give different relevance scores:\n\n|Term|Score Range|Agreement Level|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Digitalis toxicity|0 pts|High - all configs agree|\n|Ankylosing spondylitis|5 pts|High|\n|Nocturnal enuresis|5 pts|High|\n|Cricothyrostomy|7 pts|High|\n|Tonsillar herniation|13 pts|Moderate|\n|Cyclic vomiting syndrome|25 pts|Moderate|\n|Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia|35 pts|**Low - config matters**|\n|Yellow fever|50 pts|**Low - config matters**|\n\n**Breakdown for high-variance terms:**\n\n|Term|PDF-All|MD-All|MD-Content|MD-MCQ-v1|Range|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Yellow fever|45|25|55|5|50 pts|\n|Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia|85|80|75|50|35 pts|\n|Cyclic vomiting syndrome|65|90|N/A|75|25 pts|\n|Tonsillar herniation|82|95|85|90|13 pts|\n\n**Interpretation:** For most terms, configs agree on importance. But for some terms (Yellow fever, Waldenstrom), the notebook setup dramatically affects how relevant NotebookLM thinks the topic is. Yellow fever scored 55 in the content-only notebook but only 5 in the MCQ-only notebook - a 50-point swing. This suggests RAG retrieval quality varies significantly by how you organize your sources.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wip1b8utcrdg1.png?width=1785&format=png&auto=webp&s=f488e607cdbf1af2ef23df73ab1e16bdc7e858c2\n\n *Figure 3: Relevance score variance across configurations. Red bars indicate terms where notebook setup dramatically affects perceived importance.*\n\n# Key Finding 2: Splitting Sources Retrieves More Questions\n\nDoes maintaining separate content vs question notebooks help?\n\n|Term|PDF-All|MD-All|Content + MCQ-v1|Content + MCQ-v2|Best Strategy|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Cyclic vomiting syndrome|2|1|1|2|Tie|\n|Cricothyrostomy|3|4|8|5|**Split+v1**|\n|Digitalis toxicity|3|3|4|5|**Split+v2**|\n|Ankylosing spondylitis|4|3|5|8|**Split+v2**|\n|Tonsillar herniation|3|3|4|2|**Split+v1**|\n|Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia|3|2|1|1|PDF-All|\n|Yellow fever|3|0|2|1|PDF-All|\n|Nocturnal enuresis|3|3|3|3|Tie|\n|Bacillus cereus|3|3|3|6|**Split+v2**|\n|Sarcoidosis|5|3|5|8|**Split+v2**|\n|**TOTAL**|**32**|**25**|**36**|**41**||\n|*vs PDF-All*|\\--|\\-7|\\+4|\\+9||\n\n**Split notebooks won 6/10 terms.** PDF-All won 2/10. MD-All won 0/10 outright.\n\n# Key Finding 3: Customization Settings Matters\n\nSame 95 sources, different customization settings:\n\n|Customization Settings Style|Questions Retrieved|Response Length|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Standard customization settings (MD-MCQ-v1)|35|8,835 words|\n|Question-focused customization settings (MD-MCQ-v2)|40|6,685 words|\n|**Difference**|**+14%**|**-24%**|\n\nThe question-focused customization settings retrieved 14% more questions in 24% fewer words.

MD-All is fastest but retrieves fewest questions. Split+v2 retrieves most but takes longest.*\n\n# Recommendations\n\n# For Maximum Retrieval Quality\n\n**Use split notebooks with specialized customization settings (Content + MCQ-v2)**\n\n* Separate your content sources from your question sources\n* Use a question-focused customization settings for the question notebook\n* 64% more questions than single MD-All notebook\n* 28% more questions than single PDF-All notebook\n\n# For Speed\n\n**Use Markdown in a single combined notebook (MD-All)**\n\n* 2.4x faster responses than PDF\n* Retrieves \\~78% of what PDF gets, \\~61% of what split strategy gets\n* Good for quick lookups when comprehensive retrieval isn't critical\n\n# For Most Users\n\n**Single combined notebook is fine**\n\n* Simplest setup\n* Decent retrieval\n* Only optimize if retrieval quality matters for your use case\n\n# Limitations\n\n1. **No ground truth:** Relevance scores are self-reported by NotebookLM, not validated against actual source content\n2. **Small sample:** 10 terms tested; results may not generalize\n3. **Single trial:** No replication to assess variability\n4. **Source count differs:** PDF has 184 sources vs Markdown 119 (some failed conversion)\n\n# Methodology Notes\n\n**Relevance Score:** NotebookLM's self-assessment of topic importance (0-100)\n\n**PDF to Markdown Conversion:** Used GPT-4o-mini for OCR (shoutout Microsoft for Startups credits). Cost breakdown for \\~15,000 pages:\n\n|Component|Tokens|Cost|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Input (images + prompts)|\\~25M|\\~$3.75|\n|Output (OCR'd text)|\\~15M|\\~$9.00|\n|**Total**||**\\~$12-15**|\n\n*Per page: \\~1,500 tokens image input, \\~200 tokens prompt, \\~1,000 tokens output*\n\nHappy to share raw data or answer questions!",

So, I decided to convert each of my PDFs into MD format and tested things out to compare across a few different variables (speed of chat completion, quality of text output, quantity of multiple choice questions retrieved from the sources, etc.). Then, once it was clear that markdown > PDFs, I considered whether 1 markdown NotebookLM with both textbooks & multiple choice practice tests would be better or worse than 2 NotebookLM's (one for the textbook and another for the MCQ practice tests). I wasn't sufficiently happy with how the MCQ practice test setup was so I modified the customization settings and that resulted in v2. \n\nAfter all of that setup/analysis, I determined that for my workflow, and likely for others as well, one NotebookLM w/ PDF sources < one NotebookLM w/ markdown sources < multiple NotebookLMs w/ markdown sources separated by niche/format/etc. (for me this separation was textbook and MCQs as I wanted to optimize the chatbot's retrieval of textbook- and MCQ-relevant text from my sources).\n\nI hope that clears things up a bit.

      "text": "Hi everyone,\nI know there have been a few scripts floating around here to download podcasts or upload files, but I found most of them relied heavily on browser automation (Selenium/Playwright) for every single action. This made them slow and prone to breaking whenever the UI changed.\nI wanted a robust solution for building actual pipelines, so I spent some time reverse-engineering the internal RPCs (Protobufs) to build a proper Python SDK.\nIt’s called notebooklm-py.\nHow this differs from previous scripts:\nNo Selenium Runtime: Unlike wrappers that drive a browser in the background, this library talks directly to the backend API. It’s lightweight and fast. (Note: You only need a browser once for the initial auth).\nFull Feature Parity: It’s not just a downloader. You can create notes, manage sources, pin citations, and query the RAG engine programmatically.\nStability: I treat this like a production library. It has a triple-layer test suite (Unit, Integration, E2E) that runs daily to catch backend changes before they break your code.\nClaude Code Integration: I added a module that lets you install this as a \"Skill\" for the Claude CLI, allowing you to query your notebooks from the terminal.\nUse Case:\nI built this to automate \"Deep Research\" loops—scripting the creation of notebooks, uploading PDFs, and auto-generating Audio Overviews without touching the browser.\nRepo: [https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py)\nIt’s open source (MIT). If you are tired of brittle automation scripts, give this a try and let me know what you think.",

      "text": "I've been trying to using NotebookLM heavily for the past few weeks. If I just need to memorize something or make things with all the studio features, its been fine. And the source grounding and stuff like the podcasts are pretty cool.\n\nBut I feel friction when I am trying for actual learn, write, etc, and I wanted to see if others are feeling the same or they have better workflows.\n\nMy main issue is that despite the name, it feels far more like a chatbot than a notebook or workspace.\n\n* A real workspace should be dynamic. I want to move ideas around, group them, and treat them like objects. Currently, everything feels rigid. I ask a question, get a text block, and that's it. And my sources are just huge unorganized list on the left. It doesn't feel like I'm building a notebook, its more like just texting a smart search engine.\n* When asking questions, the insights are great, but they are trapped in that a one dimensional chat thread (a singular one too, since theres no separate chats).\n* I feel like I'm reading about the work rather than doing it. Because I'm not actively organizing or working with the info myself (highlighting specific connections, restructuring or rewriting stuff), it doesn't stick as well nor does it compound into something useful.\n* If I want the AI to actually know about the notes I'm writing, I have to jump through hoops: save a response to a Note, export that Note to Google Docs, and then reimport that Doc as a new source. It breaks the flow completely just to get the model to see my own work\n* Side note: I'd like to be able to switch models or also use non google ones too\n\nHow are you all handling this? Are you just using it for quick answers, or have you found a workflow where it actually feels like a workspace?",

You might like -https://learnyourway.withgoogle.com/ , I feel like notebooklm isn't great for learning itself but if you use it right, it can work as part of workflows vs learning itself.\n\nFor example, you are learning a topic let's say Ecosystems, it works better if you use visible thinking with what you are learning and then upload the visible thinking as well as the learning.\n\nYou might have a picture with see think wonder about a polluted beach, put that as one source, you upload details about your local beach. You add research cards on different things. \n\nThen you can make mind maps and find good pathways to learn.\n\nI often use my googlenotebooklm research into a Claude project with custom instructions to create projects or I use it to help guide my blog writing etc. \n\nLearnyourway is a cool idea into personalised learning, I feel like it needs more things like this with workflows.",

              "text": "I've been working with prompt engineering and LLM architecture for a while now, and I've noticed a very common error pattern: we try to create a single \"Super Prompt\" that tries to be everything at once (programmer, tester, writer, security analyst).\n\n\nThe result? The model hallucinates, forgets instructions in the middle of the text, and delivers generic outputs.\n\n\nTo solve this, I developed within NotebookLM and validated in production a framework that I call the **\"Orchestrator-Agent Pattern\"**. The idea is to stop treating AI like a chat and treat it like a **CLI (Command Line Interface)** with deterministic routing.\n\n\nI want to share the blueprint of this architecture adapted for a **Software House / DevOps** scenario, so you can apply it to your projects (works very well in NotebookLM, Claude Projects or Custom GPTs).\n\n\n---\n\n### 🏗️ The Architecture: The \"Team OS\"\n\nThe logic is to divide the intelligence into three layers:\n\n\n1. **The Router:** The main System Prompt. It does not resolve tasks. It understands the intent and invokes the specialist.\n\n2. **The Specialists:** Modular prompts injected via RAG (Knowledge Base). They only know how to do ONE thing.\n\n3. **The Truth (Ground Truth):** Company Manuals, Style Guides, and Docs.\n\n### 1. The Master Prompt (The Router)\n\nYour System Prompt should not be \"You are helpful.\" It should be a Rigid Menu.\n\n```markdown\n# SYSTEM PROMPT: DEV-NEXUS ORCHESTRATOR\n\n<core_identity>\nYou are not a chatbot. You are DEV-NEXUS, the team's intelligence engine.\n\nYour role is to process inputs, consult your EXPERT MODULES, and deliver technical artifacts.\n\n</core_identity>\n\n<prime_directives>\n⛔ ZERO CHITCHAT: Never start with \"Hello\".\n\n⛔ MANDATORY MENU: Every reply must end with the Options Menu.\n\n</prime_directives>\n\n<ROUTER_MENU>\nChoose the execution module:\n0. [MENU] Quick Menu\n1. 👨‍💻 [ARCHITECT] Code Review & Refactoring (SOLID/Clean Code)\n2. 🛡️ [SEC-OPS] Security Audit (OWASP Top 10)\n3. 📄 [DOCS] Documentation Generator (Readme/API Specs)\n</ROUTER_MENU>\n\n<EXECUTION_LOGIC>\nIf the user enters \"1\": Activate the \"ARCHITECT\" sub-agent. See \"StyleGuide.md\".\n\nIf the user enters \"2\": Activate the \"SEC-OPS\" sub-agent. Ignore style, focus on vulnerability.\n\n</EXECUTION_LOGIC>\n\n```\n\n### 2. The Trick: Sub-agents via RAG\n\nHere's the secret. Instead of putting all the rules in the main prompt, you create text files (`SUBAGENTE_SEC_OPS.txt`) and upload them to the knowledge base (RAG).\n\n\nWhen the Router decides to activate \"SEC-OPS\", it looks for this file. The template \"wears the mask\" of this specific agent.\n\n\n**Example from `SUBAGENTE_SEC_OPS.txt`:**\n\n```markdown\n<<<SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION::SEC_OPS_AGENT>>>\n\nIDENTITY: You are a Security Auditor (Red Team).\n\nTARGETS: OWASP Top 10, Hardcoded Secrets, SQL Injection.\n\n\nPROTOCOLS:\n- NEVER correct the code without first explaining the vulnerability.\n\n- CLASSIFY each risk as: 🔴 CRITICAL, 🟡 MEDIUM or 🟢 LOW.\n\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT (Required):\n| Risk | File | Line | CVE/Type | Suggestion for Fix |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 🔴 | auth.js | 42 | Hardcoded Token | Use .env |\n\n\n```\n\n### 3. Why does this work? (The Engineering behind it)\n\n1. **Cognitive Compartmentalization:** When the model is in \"SEC-OPS\" mode, it doesn't spend tokens trying to be polite or format pretty indentation. It focuses 100% on finding flaws.\n\n2. **Context Anchoring:** The menu forces the user to be objective. If the user sends a \"hi\", the system returns the menu. This professionalizes the interaction.\n\n3. **Hallucination Reduction:** Because the sub-agent has strict formatting instructions (e.g., Markdown tables), the model fills in gaps instead of generating creative text.\n\n### Where to apply?\n\n* **Marketing:** Router -> 1. Copywriter (AIDA), 2. SEO Analyst, 3. Tone of Voice Reviewer.\n* **Legal:** Router -> 1. Contract Analyst, 2. Jurisprudence Researcher, 3. Compliance Reviewer.\n* **Dev:** The example above.\n\n\nIf you are suffering from unstable prompts, try breaking the architecture this way. The consistency gain is absurd.\n\n\nFor my business I only have one word: perfect! This was said by the collaborators!\n\n\nHas anyone else here implemented this \"Router + Sub-agents\" logic via RAG?",

You don't need to upload a PDF about apples for the LLM to understand what an apple or a fruit is.\n\nNotebookLM isn't a closed knowledge vacuum, there's still an LLM in the loop (a Gemini model) which of course is trained on a vast amount of knowledge. The notebook environment is designed to primarily work with uploaded sources, but it's still fundamentally baked in with broader information that comes with an LLM when you're chatting or generating studio output. So if you ask about some (in your case) legal law concept, it can reference a wider slice of it's existing knowledge. It didn't \"google it on the spot,\" if that's how you're interpreting it?\n\nImportantly: There's no such thing as \"hallucination-proof,\" with AI, that's wasn't a good assumption to begin with (which hey, all this stuff is rapidly evolving and complicated, it's a totally understandable confusion!).",

Use a light grid-paper or drafting-paper background throughout. Illustrations should be rendered in precise black ink linework with controlled watercolor washes, evoking architectural and engineering sketches rather than playful illustration.\n\nVisuals should balance creativity and rigor: diagrams, cutaways, schematics, optimization plots, flow arrows, annotations, formulas, and marginal notes. Illustrations should feel like they come from a professional’s working notebook — analytical, intentional, and grounded in real-world constraints.\n\nUse visual metaphors sparingly but powerfully (blueprints, tools, systems, apprentices vs masters, black boxes, validation marks). Pair artistic imagery with technical structure.\n\nTypography: clean, technical, lightly hand-drawn or drafting-inspired lettering with strong hierarchy. Titles are declarative and confident; body text is concise and explanatory.\\*\\*\n\nColor palette: restrained and professional — cool blues, steel grays, muted ochres, soft graphite tones.

Use large, bold, sans-serif titles (using Impact font in all caps) as the main focus, and pair them with a single brush-script word (in Gistesy font) layered or overlapping for emphasis. It should be part of the heading phrase. Keep each slide to one short phrase or sentence rather than paragraphs or dense bullets. Use layouts with a lot of white space and one prominent photo or cropped image (often off to one side) that supports the idea on the slide. Avoid icons, clip art, and busy backgrounds. Overall, the deck should feel modern, editorial, and minimal: a bold headline, one expressive image, one script-accent word to begin or end the headline, and plenty of breathing room on every slide.",

I would upload entire books if I had them.\nMore sources can help in factual depth of course! \n\nConcentration and summary of the extensive material is the first thing an average person would try with NotebookLM, isn't it?\n\nTherefore, my enthusiasm stems from the discovery of this \"upside down\" approach:\nI wrote the material, I know the material, and tell the AI: \"use it exclusively and show me how to develop an interesting discourse according to a set of criteria, and I will repeat what sounds good when I present it myself tomorrow.\"\n\nThe key wasn't content quantity, but using the model to simulate an evaluator and rehearse against a rubric. So in this case, the structure mattered more than extra material.",
