                  "text": "There are probably many reasons. In my experience this is an amazing thing to do.  If you wanted access to the knowledge of the world, you would use regular gemini.  You are using NotebookLM as a hyperfocused self contained AI.  It is usually only using the sources you give it.  This seems to effectively stop hallucinations (situations where the AI creates a variable or deviates and things go off the rails).  Hallucinations often happen when the user doesn't give enough information so the AI plugs data in.  If you say you want a picture of a woman in a wedding dress and it gives you a woman in a red bloody dress, it is more likely because you didn't specify you wanted a white dress and as it looked through the possibility of dresses, one possible dress was some artsy rebel dress it was fed.  NotebookLM, by only using the sources you have fed it, seems to greatly reduce these fetch information from outside interactions and only uses the data you give it.  As such, if you want to study the information in a chapter, you should make a specific notebook for that chapter.  This will make your info graphics and outputs more refined and useful.  If you want the whole book, make a separate notebook for the whole book.  Each notebook will have a use case (broad vs specific). I would encourage you to use BOTH methods.  Once you have put your sources into the notebook and read through everything, made your infographics and gotten through those, go into the middle chat window and put the prompt: \"make a dungeons and dragons type game in order to quiz me on...\\[fill in topic\\]\".",

      "text": "I could not love an AI tool better than NotebookLM, I use it daily for my scientific research, paper reading, thought gathering, etc.  I also found the way it uses nano banana to generate slides is a transformative idea.  However, I have been getting a hard time to edit the slides it generates, and I tried multiple methods and wasted even more time using those different tools to alter an image.\n\n1, using Gemini or google slides to “prompt” change a page, I can use all of my daily pro/nano banana limit on a single page\n\n2, some online free pdf/ppt conversion tool, it is still image inside of the ppt!\n\n3, Canvas: seems like I have to click on the individual element to change, and needs subscription in the first place?\n\n4, some other tools mentioned online, broke my slides…\n\nI am an engineer, and of course nowadays, a vibe coder (😂），so I asked myself: hmm how hard can it be?  And decided to write my own tool to do so.\n\nIt was a great experience in the process, however I soon know it is not a vibe coding project.  In reality, reverse engineering an image is a VERY challenging task.  With the best vision models and many engineering optimizations and iterations, now this tool is working for me.  Although now I put together as a web app, the model used to achieve there only makes it a barely profitable app unless charge high.  Now I think only if big tech like google can absorb the cost into the api call…\n\nAnyway, just want to share it here and welcome anyone who wants to use it for your work.  If this pain point solving tool can indeed work for more people, it would be fantastic thing for me.\n\n~~Guess I should not promote it with URL so please DM me if you’re interested.~~\n\nUpdate: There are so many people facing the same pain point, so I guess I should not feel shy to share the link here:\n\npxGenius.ai\n\n：）",

      "text": "Hello Reddit,\n\nI am excited to announce a huge update on the NotebookLM MCP.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a96lg1kbvpgg1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0ddbd49448c33051ca733f6e0fef63b7c3f4224\n\n**TL;DR**: MCP and CLI are now one package. You can upload & download files directly (no browser needed). There's a skill installer for AI coding tools. And you can finally switch between Google accounts without losing your mind.\n\n**Why the big refactor?**\n\nI got tired of maintaining two packages. You probably got tired of figuring out which one to install. So I merged everything. One install, you get both tools. Done.\n\n**What's new:**\n\n**🔧 One Package, Both Tools**\n\n    uv tool install notebooklm-mcp-cli\n\nYou get nlm (the CLI) and notebooklm-mcp (the MCP server). The old separate packages are deprecated.\n\n**📤 Direct File Upload:** This one was painful to get working, but now you can upload PDFs, TXT, Markdown, and audio files directly through HTTP. No browser automation. For example:\n\n`nlm source add file /path/to/doc.pdf --wait`\n\n**🤖 Skill Installer:** If you're using Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor, or any other AI coding tool, you can install NotebookLM as a skill:\n\n`nlm skill install claude-code`\n\nIt drops the skill file where your tool expects it. You can also run nlm skill list to see what's installed. There are flags for user or project-level install.\n\n**🔐 Multi-Profile Auth:** Each profile gets its own Chrome session. So you can have your work account and personal account without logging out and back in constantly.\n\n`nlm login profile switch work`\n\n`nlm login profile list`\n\nYou can even set a default: \n\n    nlm config set auth.default_profile work\n\n**📥 Downloads That Actually Work:** You can download any artifact type now. Audio, video, reports, slides, infographics, mind maps, data tables. Quiz and flashcards come out as JSON, Markdown, or HTML.\n\n**📝 Notes:** Full CRUD. nlm note create, list, update, delete. MCP tools too.\n\n📤 **Export to Google Workspace:** Data Tables go to Sheets. Reports go to Docs. For example:\n\n    nlm export to-sheets <notebook> --artifact-id <id>\n\nAlso in this release:\n\n✅ Sharing API (public links, invite collaborators)\n\n✅ Dual CLI syntax (i.e, Verb-first and noun-first, for example: nlm notebook list OR nlm list notebooks)\n\n✅ Aliases (use names instead of UUIDs)\n\n✅ Interactive chat mode\n\n✅ HTTP transport for MCP (community PR)\n\n✅ Auto re-auth (survives token expiration)\n\n✅ MCP consolidated to 28 tools DESPITE adding more functionality\n\nThe workflow I'm using daily:\n\nCreate a notebook, upload some PDFs, run deep research, import the sources, generate a podcast and briefing doc, export the briefing to Docs, share it publicly. All from the terminal. No touching the UI.\n\nI'm honestly using the CLI more than the MCP at this point (through AI of course); maybe this will change when more tools have the MCP lazy load. It's just feels faster than the MCP when the AI uses it.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp-cli](https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp-cli)\n\n**Demo**: Check the README for video walkthroughs (or click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQBQigFK-E8))\n\nGo crazy. Level up your second brain game.\n\nHappy to answer questions or hear about bugs. \n\nStill a passion vibe-coding project, still maintaining it as Google changes things under the hood. At least now it will be easier to add and maintain as a unified MCP/CLI project.\n\n",

      "text": "Hey everyone! 👋 \n\nI've been frustrated with AI coding assistants hallucinating answers when I ask about my own documentation, codebase specs, or research papers. So I built **nblm** — a skill/plugin that connects your AI coding agent directly to Google NotebookLM.\n\n# The problem it solves:\n\n* 🧠 **Hallucinations** — AI makes up answers instead of citing your actual docs\n* ⚡ **Context switching** — Constantly jumping between NotebookLM web UI and your editor\n* 📚 **Limited sources** — NotebookLM only accepts URLs/files/YouTube, but I want to add books from Z-Library, papers from arXiv, etc.\n\n# Links:\n\n* **GitHub:** [https://github.com/magicseek/nblm](https://github.com/magicseek/nblm)\n* **Install:** `npx add-skill magicseek/nblm`\n\n# What nblm does:\n\n    /nblm ask \"What does our API spec say about authentication?\"\n    /nblm upload ./design-doc.pdf\n    /nblm podcast --wait --output ./deep-dive.mp3\n\nThat's it. Your AI agent now has access to Gemini-powered Q&A grounded entirely in YOUR documents.\n\n# Features:\n\n* Works with **Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Codex, Copilot**\n* One-command install: `npx add-skill magicseek/nblm`\n* Upload files, URLs, YouTube videos, Z-Library books\n* Generate podcasts, slides, infographics from your notebooks\n* Extensible plugin architecture for future sources (arXiv, Notion, Confluence planned)\n\n# How it works:\n\nUses [notebooklm-py](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py) for API operations and [agent-browser](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser) as a fallback for things NotebookLM doesn't expose via API (like file uploads and auth). Would love feedback! What sources would you want to connect to NotebookLM? I'm thinking arXiv, Notion, and Confluence next.\n\nWelcome to contribute via making PRs, don't forget to star it if you like.",

I know this sounds like a bold and risky move and I am still debating it. Would love to hear from those who are doing it. \n\nI have fed it all of the updated official IRA instructions and forms, whether applicable to my tax situation or not. It has been doing a great work explaining stuff and auditing my input. I work in finance and I am good at triple checking complex work.\n\nI filed with TurboTax last year and they charged me a good amount for a premium tier since I made personal income in two states and had a rental property in a third one.

          "text": "I asked Gemini \n\nI understand the confusion—Google recently rebranded and restructured its AI subscriptions, and the naming can be a bit of a maze.\nTo answer your main question: NotebookLM itself is still free, but Google has introduced a paid \"Pro\" tier (branded as Google AI Pro) that offers significantly higher limits. In Canada, this plan is priced at $26.99 CAD/month.\nHere is the breakdown of how the subscription works and what it means for your NotebookLM access:\n1. Is NotebookLM under Google AI Pro?\nYes and no. NotebookLM follows a \"freemium\" model:\n * The Free Tier: You can still use NotebookLM for free with your standard Google account. It includes up to 100 notebooks and 50 sources per notebook.\n * The Pro Tier: When you subscribe to Google AI Pro, your NotebookLM experience is upgraded to what was previously called \"NotebookLM Plus.\" You’ll see a \"Pro\" badge next to your profile.\n2. Why the $26.99 CAD price tag?\nThe $26.99 CAD price is the standard Canadian rate for the Google AI Pro plan (formerly known as the AI Premium plan). This is a bundled subscription that includes:\n * NotebookLM Pro: 500 notebooks (vs. 100), 300 sources per notebook (vs. 50), and 20 Audio Overviews per day (vs. 3).\n * Gemini Advanced: Access to Google’s most capable models (currently Gemini 3 Pro).\n * AI in Workspace: The ability to use Gemini directly inside Google Docs, Gmail, and Slides.\n * 2 TB of Storage: Expanded Google One storage for your Photos, Drive, and Gmail.\n3. Can you skip the subscription?\nIf you only need NotebookLM for basic research, you do not have to pay. You should be able to dismiss the \"Join Google AI Pro\" prompt and continue using the free version. The prompt usually appears because Google is pushing the \"Pro\" features (like higher usage limits and the new \"Deep Research\" mode) to frequent users.\nSummary Table: Free vs. Pro (as of Jan 2026)\n| Feature | Free Tier | Google AI Pro ($26.99 CAD) |\n|---|---|---|\n| Notebooks | 100 | 500 |\n| Sources per Notebook | 50 | 300 |\n| Daily Audio Overviews | 3 | 20 |\n| Daily Chat Queries | 50 | 500 |\n| Extra Benefits | None | 2TB Storage, Gemini in Docs/Gmail |\nWould you like me to help you find the specific settings to manage or cancel that subscription prompt, or are you looking for a comparison with other research tools?",

Important disclaimer, though - I am not very tech-savvy, I discussed the problem with Claude and Claude suggested solutions and then implemented them.\n\nClaude can easily convert the pdfs to an actual powerpoint presentation, but each slide becomes an image. So reordering and deleting is easy, editing is not possible. A workaround - Claude then extracted the text from slides and created a text-only ppt, fully editable. If I wanted to edit something (not much, just some wording), I could copy parts of the text and paste over the \"image slides\", covering the original text. Yes, it's clunky. But I hope at least the first part will be useful for you.",

To work around this, I started splitting prompts into multiple parts and then merging the outputs in Sheets. This significantly improves coverage and completeness, since it forces the model to process most of the document.\n\nIt’s still not perfect, and it doesn’t always go through the entire file. I suspect this is related to context window limits. That said, I’m genuinely impressed by how well it follows structured prompts, and the results are often phenomenal given the constraints.\n\n🤔 Curious to hear your thoughts, comments, or experiences with similar large-document extraction tasks.
