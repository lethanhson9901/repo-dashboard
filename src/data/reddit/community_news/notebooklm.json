      "text": "Hi everyone,  \nI’m writing here because I’m genuinely confused and frustrated with how NotebookLM has been behaving lately, and I’m wondering if I’m the only one experiencing this.\n\nA few months ago, NotebookLM was able to generate long, structured, and detailed documents based on my sources — we’re talking about outputs that, once pasted into Word, **easily became 50–60 pages of well-organized study material**. It was incredibly useful for studying.\n\nNow, using the *exact same sources* and the *same prompts* I’ve always used, the output feels drastically worse. **The documents are extremely short** (like 5–6 pages in Word), overly summarized, and mostly just shallow bullet points with no real depth. There’s almost no elaboration, no proper structure, and nothing that feels like a complete study document anymore.\n\nI also purchased **Gemini Pro**, hoping that would improve things — but after running tests with both Pro and non‑Pro accounts, the results are basically the same: it still produces short, superficial outputs that don’t use the full source material. Even prompts that used to generate complete and accurate documents now fail to do so.\n\nIt honestly feels like a downgrade rather than an improvement — like NotebookLM has lost the ability to produce detailed long‑form output. At this point, I find the tool almost unusable for studying because it compresses everything into high‑level summaries instead of generating full, detailed documents based on the provided sources.\n\nHas anyone else noticed this change?  \nDid something change with recent updates (context limits, output limits, generation strategy, model integration, etc.)?  \nOr is there some setting or workaround I’m missing?\n\nI’m surprised that updates seem to have made the tool significantly worse, to the point where I can’t rely on it anymore for the use case it was excellent at before.\n\nWould really appreciate hearing if others are having the same experience.  \nThanks!",

However, you can use the **Gemini App (Pro/Ultra)** to process your notebooks, which offers much deeper, longer, and more sophisticated responses.\n\n# Method 1: Use the Gemini Web App (Best for Depth)\n\n# Method 2: Configure \"Custom Goals\" in NotebookLM\n\n# Method 3: Use the \"Studio\" Outputs",

Completeness is decent, but the style and layout often drift from the original.  \n\n\nQuestion 2. Very limited visual styles  \nThe default NotebookLM slides feel quite template-ish.  \nI’ve experimented with prompt-based style hints and documented some of them here:  \n[https://github.com/serenakeyitan/awesome-notebookLM-prompts](https://github.com/serenakeyitan/awesome-notebookLM-prompts)\n\n  \nCurious if people have found a better or more sustainable workflow?",

It's so straightforward it feels like a hack.\n\nI teach high school science, use NBLM for creating slide decks for whole chapters or more narrowly hard-to-underatand sections. Infographics make awesome visual review tools. From NBLM on your PC, download/save to your local GDrive file directory tree. Open GDrive app on your tablet, select the saved PDF, select \"send to\" and choose the SNote app. It'll conveniently ask you if you want to create a new Note file or append to one that already exists. Boom, now the NBLM PDF is on your tablet in SNote.\n\nHand edit as desired using stylus and pens, or type over, or copy-paste graphics like rectangles that match the background colors to \"blank out\" things you don't want to see like watermarks or misspellings. (Teacher tip: \"send to\" the SNote app your empty or incomplete notes, then teach from your tablet wirelessly projecting as you add/complete the notes live on-screen; helps engagement during note sessions).\n\nWhen finished editing, click the share icon and you're presented with a selection of like a dozen different export formats from individual images per slide, or our fav PDF, and others you may find useful. Then for destination app you select GDrive. Select the original file name to overwrite if you like or give a new name for new version. Set the destination directory and boom, you're done. Back to your PC for new work in NBLM.\n\nThe SNote app has always been a great sleeper of an app for teachers who know how to use it. All I had to do was purchase a $30 wireless adapter dongle, plug into the projector or smartboard HDMI input. Game changer.",

All the other elements were exactly the same as the original snip.\n\nWhat I found when generating presentation slides, be specific what you want it to produce by editing the prompt inside the presentation tool.\n\nIt does a phenomenal job. Better than I could ever produce in literally a fraction of the time. Even with the post Edit using the hacks above, I saved at least an hour.",

The audio, however, is good if you don't mind the generic and familiar US podcaster voices.\n\nI'm constantly amazed by what NBLM can do, but also aware that it is not without limitations.",

I wonder why this isn't updating. Oh GitHub's nuked the repo quietly and not said a thing I would still be infected now if I didn't get curious over why it didn't update. \n\nTechnically I am still infected now because the windows nuke is today Cuz I just could not find the motivation to delete most of my digital memories cuz you can't trust any file program or anything that was accessed. I would say after the 1st of November cuz I think it was update 7 and update 8 at Gemini desk turnt from a decent software into fucking malware",

      "text": "Disclaimer:   \n  \n**The Problem:** You finish a chapter, realize you absorbed nothing, but dread re-reading it. **The Fix:** A quick export to NotebookLM to visualize the scene instead of reading it again.\n\nHere is how I turn a \"lost\" chapter into a clear mental map in 5 minutes:\n\n# The Workflow ⚙️\n\n1. **Open Kindle on PC (or any app that allows copying text):** This is crucial because copying text on mobile apps is often tedious. On the PC app, Cloud Reader, or any other desktop reader, it’s easier to highlight and copy larger chunks.\n2. **Copy the Chapter:** I grab the text of the specific chapter I just struggled with.\n   * *Note on DRM:* Be aware that publishers set copy limits (clipboard limits) on Kindle books. If you hit the limit, you might get a warning. Usually, copying one chapter at a time works fine for me, but YMMV based on the specific book settings.\n3. **Paste into NotebookLM:** Create a new notebook and paste the text as a \"Copied Text\" source.\n\n# What I ask it to do (The Prompts) 🤖\n\nOnce the text is in, I don't just ask for a summary. I use the tools to \"see\" the data differently:\n\n* **The \"Vibe Check\" (Audio Overview):** I start with the Audio Overview. It’s perfect for letting two \"hosts\" discuss the chapter while I grab a coffee. It often highlights themes I completely missed while struggling with the syntax.\n* **The Visualization (e.g., for Mystery/Fantasy):** If users are in a complex location (like a Cluedo board scenario), I ask: *\"Create a room plan/layout based on the descriptions. Who is standing where? What does the room look like from top-down?\"* It helps visualize the scene vividly.\n* **Character Tracking (Data Table):** I ask it to format a table of characters present in the chapter, their current status, and their hidden motives mentioned in the text.\n* **Flashcards:** I use the Study Guide/Flashcard feature to test if I actually retained the key plot points this time.\n* **Slide Deck:** I ask it to structure the key events as a presentation outline. This forces the AI to break down the narrative arc into logical steps.\n\n# Why this works\n\nIt turns passive, confused reading into active engagement. Instead of re-reading a wall of text, I’m looking at a generated \"map\" of the room or listening to a discussion about it. It fills in the gaps where my focus drifted.",

              "text": "I started with the [AWS re:Invent 2025](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2yQDdvlhXf_NqSnDKx7Hbb9FrNQKmxg7&si=h6PCmjt-m6amtEgT) YouTube playlist posted on the [AWS Events](https://www.youtube.com/@AWSEventsChannel) channel. This playlist contains most all of the sessions including the breakout sessions. After a lot of trial and error, I settled on the following process:\n\n1. I sequentially went down the AWS Events playlist and manually added each session to my own created YouTube public playlists in blocks of 30 videos per playlist.\n2. Created a NotebookLM project for each of my 30 video created playlists.\n3. Then, I used the Chrome Extensions [NotebookLM Web Importer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/notebooklm-web-importer/ijdefdijdmghafocfmmdojfghnpelnfn) and [NotebookLM - WebSync Full Site Importer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/notebooklm-websync-full-s/hjoonjdnhagnpfgifhjolheimamcafok) to import the YouTube playlists that I created into their corresponding NotebookLM projects. You only need one of these extensions. They both work equally well. I started with the Web Importer and switched to WebSync because I discovered that it saved me a few clicks.\n4. Then, I used the [Kortex ](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/kortex/hdapplggdhndkblofffknpmnnnnbncbn)extension to download each of the 30 sources as .txt files in my NotebookLM projects into its own zip file. I extracted the zip file which gave me a folder of 30 .txt files with each file being a complete transcript of its corresponding session.\n5. Then, I went to the free online service, [merge2md](https://ms-soft.jp/en/tools/merge2md/), added the unzipped folder, merged the 30 .txt files and downloaded them as one combined .txt file. The service gives you the option to download the combined file as either text or markdown. I learned that I needed to download it as text which I will explain later.\n6. Then, I created a new Google doc and opened the combined text file in the Google doc.\n7. Then, I downloaded the Google doc and chose the download option of Markdown (.md). I added the Markdown file as a source to the public [AWS re:Invent 2025 All Sessions](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/531e0eeb-8540-4fb7-abbf-bd3d11c19f1b) NotebookLM project. I repeated these steps for each of the 34 sources in the notebook.\n\nInitially, I tried extracting the 30 video NotebookLM projects as Markdown. The Kortex extension provides a choice of Markdown or text. Also, the merge2md online tool provides a choice of merging the files as either Markdown or text. However, I found that these Markdown files did not work well in NotebookLM. I tested it by asking for the transcript of a particular session and got replies that the transcript was not available even though I could clearly see it in the source. So, I changed the process and only choose the text option which did not involve the Google doc. I added the merge2md combined text file as the source to NotebookLM. When I asked for a transcript in the chat, NotebookLM accurately responded with it -- but the performance was awful. It was slow and clunky. Knowing that Markdown is the preferred format for LLMs and NotebookLM, I decided to take the merge2md combined file and use a Google product (Docs) to convert it to Markdown before feeding it to another Google product (NotebookLM). The result was better performance with snappier and more accurate (I think) responses. Now that I have a playbook, the AWS re:Invent 2026 NotebookLM project should go a lot faster and smoother.",

But the deep research feature is still far from Perplexity/Gemini in terms of depth. One workaround i've found is running a deep research in Perplexity and just copy pasting the list of sources (links) into Notebooklm's source import option. This is still imperfect because Perplexity's source list doesn't include everything in their research report. \n\nIs anyone else using Notebooklm for serious research work (where you can't afford hallucinations)?\n\n",

That's it. No cloning repos (still available of course), no manual setup, etc.\n\n**New videos for non-technical users:**  \nSome of you and some YouTube viewers mentioned that the original demo felt too developer-focused (command-line Claude code). Fair point. So I created two new walkthroughs showing how to use the MCP with AI tools that don't require coding:\n\n* [Using the MCP with Claude Desktop](https://youtu.be/PU8JhgLPxes) (works with Free subs too)\n* [Using the MCP with Perplexity Desktop](https://youtu.be/BCKlDNg-qxs)\n\nThe perplexity video was pretty cool. I tested a workflow of asking Perplexity to run a deep research and then adding it to a notebook (as pasted text) - it worked!\n\nReminder - Repo: [https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp](https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp)\n\nIf you tried it before and bounced off the setup, give it another shot. And if you're not technical but curious about automating NotebookLM workflows, the new videos should help.\n\nHappy to answer questions!",

      "text": "Like many of you, I’m a heavy user of **Google NotebookLM**. It’s an incredible tool for research, but I always struggled with one thing: **Exporting content.**\n\nI found myself in a frustrating loop:\n\n1. I needed to export a Mindmap, so I searched for and installed Extension A.\n2. Then I wanted to save Flashcards to Anki, so I had to find Extension B.\n3. Later, I needed a clean PDF/Word report, and... you guessed it, Extension C.\n\nInstalling 4-5 different extensions just to get my data out felt like a waste of time. I wanted a **single, seamless solution** that handles everything.\n\nSo, I decided to build it myself: [**NotebookLM Export Tool**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/notebooklm-export-tool/afchokljnhhggkhedfbmkcmdagjmjchj).\n\n# What it does (All-in-One):\n\n* **Notes & Reports:** Export to Markdown, Word (.docx), or PDF.\n* **Visuals:** One-click export for **Mindmaps** (PNG/SVG) and **Infographics**.\n* **Learning:** Export **Flashcards** directly to CSV/Markdown (Anki compatible).\n* **Slides:** Batch download as ZIP or stitch into a long image.\n* **Data:** Tables to CSV/Excel and Chat History to Markdown.\n* **Privacy:** 100% local processing. Your data never leaves your browser.\n\n# Why I’m sharing this:\n\nThis is the first version (v1.0.0). My goal was to stop the \"extension hopping\" and create a tool that \"just works\" for every export need.\n\n**I’d love to get your feedback:**\n\n1. What’s the most frustrating part of your NotebookLM workflow right now?\n2. Are there any specific formats or \"types\" of content I missed?\n3. How can I make the UI feel even more native to NotebookLM?\n\nI’m planning to keep improving this based on what this community actually needs.\n\nThanks for reading! Looking forward to your suggestions.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\nI know there have been a few scripts floating around here to download podcasts or upload files, but I found most of them relied heavily on browser automation (Selenium/Playwright) for every single action. This made them slow and prone to breaking whenever the UI changed.\nI wanted a robust solution for building actual pipelines, so I spent some time reverse-engineering the internal RPCs (Protobufs) to build a proper Python SDK.\nIt’s called notebooklm-py.\nHow this differs from previous scripts:\nNo Selenium Runtime: Unlike wrappers that drive a browser in the background, this library talks directly to the backend API. It’s lightweight and fast. (Note: You only need a browser once for the initial auth).\nFull Feature Parity: It’s not just a downloader. You can create notes, manage sources, pin citations, and query the RAG engine programmatically.\nStability: I treat this like a production library. It has a triple-layer test suite (Unit, Integration, E2E) that runs daily to catch backend changes before they break your code.\nClaude Code Integration: I added a module that lets you install this as a \"Skill\" for the Claude CLI, allowing you to query your notebooks from the terminal.\nUse Case:\nI built this to automate \"Deep Research\" loops—scripting the creation of notebooks, uploading PDFs, and auto-generating Audio Overviews without touching the browser.\nRepo: [https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py)\nIt’s open source (MIT). If you are tired of brittle automation scripts, give this a try and let me know what you think.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI wanted to share a project I’ve been working on for a while.\n\nLike many of you, I love using NotebookLM, but I really wanted to integrate it into my AI coding workflows (specifically with Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex and Cursor - yes, I use all of them :). I looked at existing MCP (Model Context Protocol) solutions, but I noticed most of them rely on browser automation like Puppeteer or Selenium.\n\nIn my experience, those can be a bit heavy and prone to breaking if the UI changes.\n\nSo, I decided to try a different approach. I reverse-engineered the internal Google RPC calls to create a **NotebookLM MCP that runs entirely on HTTP requests.**\n\n**What makes it different:**\n\n* **Speed & Stability:** Since it doesn’t need to spawn a headless browser, it’s much faster and lighter on resources.\n* **Functionality:** I managed to map out about 31 different tools. You can create notebooks, upload sources, sync Google Drive files that are out of date, and even generate Audio Overviews programmatically. Warning: it will consume a nice chunk of your context window, so disable it when not in use.\n\n**How it works:** For example, you can ask your AI agent to: \"Create a new notebook about Topic X, run a deep/fast research, add all sources, and then generate a custom video, audio overviews, an infographic, and a briefing doc.\"\n\nMy most significant pain point was checking with gDrive sources that are not fresh in a Notebook; manually checking and refreshing was cumbersome - my MCP automates that.\n\nI put together a 15-minute demo video and the full source code on GitHub. It’s open-source (MIT license), and I’d love for this community to give it a spin.\n\nI am really curious to see what kind of workflows you can build with this. Let me know if you run into any bugs - it’s definitely a passion project, but I hope to maintain it (as no doubt Google will change RPCs over time).\n\n**Repo & Demo:** [**https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp**](https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ki00o9ytrkag1.jpg?width=1022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=753f25cc06d03288a9bd40df00ce47fa5328e550\n\n",

In your related video (also nicely explained), you talked about the context size issue with loading so many tools. I believe there are ways to create different “toolset groups”. So for example if you are only planning to query existing notebooks, you enable a few tools for that purpose and context token usage will be very low. If you plan to do lots of notebook administration, you enable the tools allowing creating, editing, and deleting notebooks, for example. And then you have a kitchen sink version when context isn’t an issue, which is what you have now.\n\nFor what it’s worth… from Gemini.\n\nThree Ways to Build This\n\nOption A: The \"Launcher\" (Router) Pattern\nInstead of 31 tools, you load one tool called switch_mode.\n1. The user starts in \"Base Mode\" (minimal tools).\n2. If the user says \"I need to analyze these logs,\" the model calls switch_mode(mode=\"log_analysis\").\n3. The MCP server then refreshes the tool list provided to the LLM to only include the 5 tools relevant to logs.\n\n\nOption B: The Multi-Server Approach\nMCP allows any client) to connect to multiple servers at once.\n• Server 1 (The Core): 5 essential tools always loaded.\n• Server 2 (The Data Scientist): 10 tools for math/charts.\n• Server 3 (The Researcher): 10 tools for web search/PDF reading.\nYou can create a \"Controller\" script that connects/disconnects these servers dynamically based on user selection in the UI.\n\n\nOption C: Functional Grouping (Most Efficient)\nYou rewrite the MCP server logic to categorize tools into \"Toolsets.\" When the client asks for list_tools, the server checks an environment variable or a configuration flag to decide which set to return.",

And the source grounding and stuff like the podcasts are pretty cool.\n\nBut I feel friction when I am trying for actual learn, write, etc, and I wanted to see if others are feeling the same or they have better workflows.\n\nMy main issue is that despite the name, it feels far more like a chatbot than a notebook or workspace.\n\n* A real workspace should be dynamic. I want to move ideas around, group them, and treat them like objects. Currently, everything feels rigid. I ask a question, get a text block, and that's it. And my sources are just huge unorganized list on the left. It doesn't feel like I'm building a notebook, its more like just texting a smart search engine.\n* When asking questions, the insights are great, but they are trapped in that a one dimensional chat thread (a singular one too, since theres no separate chats).\n* I feel like I'm reading about the work rather than doing it. Because I'm not actively organizing or working with the info myself (highlighting specific connections, restructuring or rewriting stuff), it doesn't stick as well nor does it compound into something useful.\n* If I want the AI to actually know about the notes I'm writing, I have to jump through hoops: save a response to a Note, export that Note to Google Docs, and then reimport that Doc as a new source. It breaks the flow completely just to get the model to see my own work\n* Side note: I'd like to be able to switch models or also use non google ones too\n\nHow are you all handling this? Are you just using it for quick answers, or have you found a workflow where it actually feels like a workspace?",

You might like -https://learnyourway.withgoogle.com/ , I feel like notebooklm isn't great for learning itself but if you use it right, it can work as part of workflows vs learning itself.\n\nFor example, you are learning a topic let's say Ecosystems, it works better if you use visible thinking with what you are learning and then upload the visible thinking as well as the learning.\n\nYou might have a picture with see think wonder about a polluted beach, put that as one source, you upload details about your local beach. You add research cards on different things. \n\nThen you can make mind maps and find good pathways to learn.\n\nI often use my googlenotebooklm research into a Claude project with custom instructions to create projects or I use it to help guide my blog writing etc. \n\nLearnyourway is a cool idea into personalised learning, I feel like it needs more things like this with workflows.",

              "text": "I've been working with prompt engineering and LLM architecture for a while now, and I've noticed a very common error pattern: we try to create a single \"Super Prompt\" that tries to be everything at once (programmer, tester, writer, security analyst).\n\n\nThe result? The model hallucinates, forgets instructions in the middle of the text, and delivers generic outputs.\n\n\nTo solve this, I developed within NotebookLM and validated in production a framework that I call the **\"Orchestrator-Agent Pattern\"**. The idea is to stop treating AI like a chat and treat it like a **CLI (Command Line Interface)** with deterministic routing.\n\n\nI want to share the blueprint of this architecture adapted for a **Software House / DevOps** scenario, so you can apply it to your projects (works very well in NotebookLM, Claude Projects or Custom GPTs).\n\n\n---\n\n### 🏗️ The Architecture: The \"Team OS\"\n\nThe logic is to divide the intelligence into three layers:\n\n\n1. **The Router:** The main System Prompt. It does not resolve tasks. It understands the intent and invokes the specialist.\n\n2. **The Specialists:** Modular prompts injected via RAG (Knowledge Base). They only know how to do ONE thing.\n\n3. **The Truth (Ground Truth):** Company Manuals, Style Guides, and Docs.\n\n### 1. The Master Prompt (The Router)\n\nYour System Prompt should not be \"You are helpful.\" It should be a Rigid Menu.\n\n```markdown\n# SYSTEM PROMPT: DEV-NEXUS ORCHESTRATOR\n\n<core_identity>\nYou are not a chatbot. You are DEV-NEXUS, the team's intelligence engine.\n\nYour role is to process inputs, consult your EXPERT MODULES, and deliver technical artifacts.\n\n</core_identity>\n\n<prime_directives>\n⛔ ZERO CHITCHAT: Never start with \"Hello\".\n\n⛔ MANDATORY MENU: Every reply must end with the Options Menu.\n\n</prime_directives>\n\n<ROUTER_MENU>\nChoose the execution module:\n0. [MENU] Quick Menu\n1. 👨‍💻 [ARCHITECT] Code Review & Refactoring (SOLID/Clean Code)\n2. 🛡️ [SEC-OPS] Security Audit (OWASP Top 10)\n3. 📄 [DOCS] Documentation Generator (Readme/API Specs)\n</ROUTER_MENU>\n\n<EXECUTION_LOGIC>\nIf the user enters \"1\": Activate the \"ARCHITECT\" sub-agent. See \"StyleGuide.md\".\n\nIf the user enters \"2\": Activate the \"SEC-OPS\" sub-agent. Ignore style, focus on vulnerability.\n\n</EXECUTION_LOGIC>\n\n```\n\n### 2. The Trick: Sub-agents via RAG\n\nHere's the secret. Instead of putting all the rules in the main prompt, you create text files (`SUBAGENTE_SEC_OPS.txt`) and upload them to the knowledge base (RAG).\n\n\nWhen the Router decides to activate \"SEC-OPS\", it looks for this file. The template \"wears the mask\" of this specific agent.\n\n\n**Example from `SUBAGENTE_SEC_OPS.txt`:**\n\n```markdown\n<<<SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION::SEC_OPS_AGENT>>>\n\nIDENTITY: You are a Security Auditor (Red Team).\n\nTARGETS: OWASP Top 10, Hardcoded Secrets, SQL Injection.\n\n\nPROTOCOLS:\n- NEVER correct the code without first explaining the vulnerability.\n\n- CLASSIFY each risk as: 🔴 CRITICAL, 🟡 MEDIUM or 🟢 LOW.\n\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT (Required):\n| Risk | File | Line | CVE/Type | Suggestion for Fix |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 🔴 | auth.js | 42 | Hardcoded Token | Use .env |\n\n\n```\n\n### 3. Why does this work? (The Engineering behind it)\n\n1. **Cognitive Compartmentalization:** When the model is in \"SEC-OPS\" mode, it doesn't spend tokens trying to be polite or format pretty indentation. It focuses 100% on finding flaws.\n\n2. **Context Anchoring:** The menu forces the user to be objective. If the user sends a \"hi\", the system returns the menu. This professionalizes the interaction.\n\n3. **Hallucination Reduction:** Because the sub-agent has strict formatting instructions (e.g., Markdown tables), the model fills in gaps instead of generating creative text.\n\n### Where to apply?\n\n* **Marketing:** Router -> 1. Copywriter (AIDA), 2. SEO Analyst, 3. Tone of Voice Reviewer.\n* **Legal:** Router -> 1. Contract Analyst, 2. Jurisprudence Researcher, 3. Compliance Reviewer.\n* **Dev:** The example above.\n\n\nIf you are suffering from unstable prompts, try breaking the architecture this way. The consistency gain is absurd.\n\n\nFor my business I only have one word: perfect! This was said by the collaborators!\n\n\nHas anyone else here implemented this \"Router + Sub-agents\" logic via RAG?",

If you want to create quizzes or flashcards for a specific topic, simply check that specific source and uncheck the others. You can repeat this for each topic, renaming the generated Quizzes or flashcards to avoid confusion (to rename them, just open the note and click the title to edit).\n​You can even customize the output by giving the AI specific prompts for example, asking for 'harder questions' or 'true/false formats.'\n\n Just keep in mind that there may be usage limits depending on whether you are using the free or pro version.",

Split+v2 achieves 64% more than MD-All and 28% more than PDF-All.*\n\n# Key Finding 1: Relevance Scores Vary by Configuration\n\nFor the same search term, different notebook setups give different relevance scores:\n\n|Term|Score Range|Agreement Level|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Digitalis toxicity|0 pts|High - all configs agree|\n|Ankylosing spondylitis|5 pts|High|\n|Nocturnal enuresis|5 pts|High|\n|Cricothyrostomy|7 pts|High|\n|Tonsillar herniation|13 pts|Moderate|\n|Cyclic vomiting syndrome|25 pts|Moderate|\n|Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia|35 pts|**Low - config matters**|\n|Yellow fever|50 pts|**Low - config matters**|\n\n**Breakdown for high-variance terms:**\n\n|Term|PDF-All|MD-All|MD-Content|MD-MCQ-v1|Range|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Yellow fever|45|25|55|5|50 pts|\n|Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia|85|80|75|50|35 pts|\n|Cyclic vomiting syndrome|65|90|N/A|75|25 pts|\n|Tonsillar herniation|82|95|85|90|13 pts|\n\n**Interpretation:** For most terms, configs agree on importance. But for some terms (Yellow fever, Waldenstrom), the notebook setup dramatically affects how relevant NotebookLM thinks the topic is. Yellow fever scored 55 in the content-only notebook but only 5 in the MCQ-only notebook - a 50-point swing. This suggests RAG retrieval quality varies significantly by how you organize your sources.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wip1b8utcrdg1.png?width=1785&format=png&auto=webp&s=f488e607cdbf1af2ef23df73ab1e16bdc7e858c2\n\n *Figure 3: Relevance score variance across configurations.

So, I decided to convert each of my PDFs into MD format and tested things out to compare across a few different variables (speed of chat completion, quality of text output, quantity of multiple choice questions retrieved from the sources, etc.). Then, once it was clear that markdown > PDFs, I considered whether 1 markdown NotebookLM with both textbooks & multiple choice practice tests would be better or worse than 2 NotebookLM's (one for the textbook and another for the MCQ practice tests). I wasn't sufficiently happy with how the MCQ practice test setup was so I modified the customization settings and that resulted in v2. \n\nAfter all of that setup/analysis, I determined that for my workflow, and likely for others as well, one NotebookLM w/ PDF sources < one NotebookLM w/ markdown sources < multiple NotebookLMs w/ markdown sources separated by niche/format/etc. (for me this separation was textbook and MCQs as I wanted to optimize the chatbot's retrieval of textbook- and MCQ-relevant text from my sources).\n\nI hope that clears things up a bit.

      "text": "Hi everyone, I've been obsessed with NotebookLM recently, but the slide generation has one major flaw that drives me crazy: the output is a static PDF. You can't edit the text, change translations, or fix layouts without recreate everything from scratch.\n\nAs a developer, I decided to fix this. I spent my New Year holiday building WipelyAI.\n\nHow it works: Unlike simple converters, it uses OCR and OpenCV (running right in your browser!) to:\n\n1. Remove the original text and intelligently fill the background.\n2. Recreate editable text boxes in their original positions and colors.\n3. Export a real .pptx file where you can actually click and edit the text.\n\nPrivacy: Since it uses opencv.js, most of the heavy lifting is done client-side. Your data privacy is respected.\n\nEarly Adopter Gift: The site is brand new and might have some bugs. To get some feedback, I'm offering 1-year Pro access for FREE.（before January 9） • No credit card required. • Just go to the upgrade page and select the 1-year trial ($0.00). • Even without Pro, the daily limit is generous (10 files/day). Check it out here: [https://www.wipelyai.cv/](https://www.wipelyai.cv/)\n\n**\\[Fixed\\]** **~~Currently OCR feature has a bug with English chars, I'm working on it.~~**",

It asks questions, it gets information needed for the chat is having with me and so on.\n\nmy conclusion: giving access to a notebook to a gemini chat transforms the chat into an agent that uses your specific notebook to get additional information for the specific chat you are having with it. \n\nwhat are your thoughts? how do you integrate the notebookLM in chats you are having in gemini?\n\nsidenote: english is not my main language. i renounced to a polished AI text to avoid you know what in the comments. or maybe i prompted AI to write like this. you decide ;-)",

          "text": "Be careful with this.  After reading this, I went to my Gemini (Pro account) and loaded a particularly large NotebookLM that I had.  In my chat with Gemini it ignored some key information from that Notebook.  When I specifically asked about that topic, again, it answered like it didn't know.  Then I went to the Notebook directly and asked it about this specific topic and it gave a very detailed response as I would expect.  I copied this and went back to the Gemini chat and told Gemini that I was concerned it wasn't accessing all the Notebook's info, and I pasted the Notebook's answer.  Suddenly, Gemini realizes and says, \"You are absolutely correct. The specific details regarding **t**his were not present in the initial file fragments I had access to. Thank you for providing that detailed excerpt—it fills a significant gap\".  I asked about this more and said I was concerned about it.  Why did it happen?  \"This is a completely fair question. I want to be transparent about why this happened so you can trust the process and get better results next time.  The issue likely stems from **how AI \"reads\" large files** (like a Notebook). I do not \"know\" or \"read\" the entire uploaded Notebook at once in the way a human reads a book cover-to-cover. Instead, I rely on a **retrieval process**.\"  Interesting, is there anything I could or should have done to prevent Gemini from missing this info? \n\n\"**Use \"Anchor\" Keywords:** If you suspect a specific topic exists (like a location, a person, or a date), include it.  \n\"**Ask for an Index or List First:** Before asking for details, ask for a high-level scan.\"  \n\"Ask for \"Outliers\"\"  \n  \n\"In short: **I can only \"know\" what I am successfully able to retrieve.** When asking about large files, being specific (even slightly, like asking about \"XXX\") acts as a hook that pulls the right information to the surface.\"\n\nI just thought this experience may help others.",

          "text": "Your observation is spot on — Gemini essentially becomes an \"agent\" that queries your notebook using RAG retrieval.\n\nThere are actually two distinct ways to integrate:\n\n  1. In-conversation: Click \\[+\\] → NotebookLM → attach for that specific chat session\n\n  2. In Gems: Attach notebook to a Gem's Knowledge Base → becomes permanent expertise for all conversations with that Gem\n\nThe Gem approach is more powerful for recurring use cases. You get Gemini's reasoning + web access + your notebook's 300 sources as grounded context. Think of it as: Gemini = brain (reasoning), NotebookLM = memory (retrieval).\n\nPro tip from experience: Combine three layers for maximum effect:\n\n  \\- NotebookLM for domain expertise (your 10 sources about the topic)\n\n  \\- Google Docs/Sheets in Gem Knowledge Base for dynamic data (updates in real-time!)\n\n  \\- \"@Google Keep\" for personal context (Gems can query Keep on-demand)\n\nOne caveat from u/New_Refuse_9041's comment above is real — Gemini uses retrieval, not full document reading. Be specific with keywords to \"hook\" the right information.\n\nI wrote a detailed breakdown of the Three-Layer Architecture and Gem integration patterns here if you want to dive deeper: [https://jsonobject.com/gemini-gems-building-your-personal-ai-expert-army-with-dynamic-knowledge-bases](https://jsonobject.com/gemini-gems-building-your-personal-ai-expert-army-with-dynamic-knowledge-bases)",

I will ask Gemini to create the character, and it does a great job although I frequently have to rename them because it pulls from a very limited database of names it seems.

Then as I write the story that covers that day, I will put that into NotebookLM as GAMEWORLD DATE-STORY. I also have a source note in NotebookLM that explains what the RAW and the STORY filenames indicate. \n\nGemini also helped me create the structure of the city.

Presumably it is the same for both? In theory I could have 10 notebooks of 300 sources each accessible via Gemini 3 Pro. Usually active tokens are in the region of 100 - 300k - so well inside the context window. It's always going to give you the top 50-100 most likely chunks in response to a query   irrespective of the number of sources. So provided active tokens remain in the context window and possible chunks do not exceed 100, Gemini AI should work the same as NBLM for RAG, all other things being equal. Have I got that right? I asked NBLM how it would handle > 100 equally probable chunks to decide how it would decide what to exclude, and it struggled to explain.  My guess is that it would just keep moving along to the right of the decimal point to decide.",

I wouldn't be surprised if the mp3 conversion would do it as well.  \n\nI haven't done what you are doing for my classes.  I generally flip it, and try to get them to use it. One thing I do, is point out that my lecture captures (Panopto) can be added via transcripts.  The slides can be added as well, plus their notes.  Use that to build out weekly study guides.  If there are key items I think they should know, I will share those via Google drive (so I can update them, and they can update the documents instead of having to delete and reupload).\n\nOne reason I do this, is that at my institution, we are VERY locked down. Only others in our domain can see our notebooks.  Since students are on a separate domain, I can't share with them.  I do know another professor was shown this functionality last summer and created audio overviews of each chapter (she wrote her book).  Her immediate, next day feedback was great.  \n\nAt the end of the last semester I used it to consolidate feedback from students on presentations. (They have to watch other presentations and give feedback on other students.)  I had them fill out a form for each group and give feedback.  I pulled that into NBLM as a Google Sheet and then had NBLM create feedback for each group's presentation.  I also had it create an infographic on that feedback.  It worked amazingly well.  I wrote up a blog post (and near the end I shared out a google drive folder with examples, so you can basically rebuild what I did easily).   \n[https://atomicego.com/ai-use-cases-tutorials/notebooklm-tidbit-automate-sentiment-analysis-from-google-forms](https://atomicego.com/ai-use-cases-tutorials/notebooklm-tidbit-automate-sentiment-analysis-from-google-forms) \n\nFor those that may complain about using AI for grading, I didn't do that.

I'll post a few more slides from the same deck after this one.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xgy4drurqbdg1.png?width=1620&format=png&auto=webp&s=abe5fe262587db2136e0e8caec3eca9427ece182\n\nCreate an illustrated explainer slide deck in a hand-drawn technical sketch style, blending engineering notebook aesthetics with conceptual storytelling. Use a light grid-paper or drafting-paper background throughout. Illustrations should be rendered in precise black ink linework with controlled watercolor washes, evoking architectural and engineering sketches rather than playful illustration.\n\nVisuals should balance creativity and rigor: diagrams, cutaways, schematics, optimization plots, flow arrows, annotations, formulas, and marginal notes. Illustrations should feel like they come from a professional’s working notebook — analytical, intentional, and grounded in real-world constraints.\n\nUse visual metaphors sparingly but powerfully (blueprints, tools, systems, apprentices vs masters, black boxes, validation marks). Pair artistic imagery with technical structure.\n\nTypography: clean, technical, lightly hand-drawn or drafting-inspired lettering with strong hierarchy. Titles are declarative and confident; body text is concise and explanatory.\\*\\*\n\nColor palette: restrained and professional — cool blues, steel grays, muted ochres, soft graphite tones. Watercolor is used to emphasize regions, flows, or contrasts, not decoration. Red is reserved for warnings, constraints, or regulatory emphasis.\\*\\*\n\nLayout principles:\n\n– One core argument per slide\n\n– Diagram-first, text-second\n\n– Clear left/right or before/after comparisons\n\n– Marginal annotations and callouts\n\nTone: authoritative, reflective, systems-oriented. Treats the audience as capable professionals.\\*\\*\n\nOverall aesthetic: high-end technical editorial, architect’s sketchbook, engineering reasoning made visible.\\*\\*\n\nAvoid playful illustration, stock visuals, or flat presentation graphics. Prioritize technical credibility, hand-drawn precision, and professional seriousness.",

Use large, bold, sans-serif titles (using Impact font in all caps) as the main focus, and pair them with a single brush-script word (in Gistesy font) layered or overlapping for emphasis. It should be part of the heading phrase. Keep each slide to one short phrase or sentence rather than paragraphs or dense bullets. Use layouts with a lot of white space and one prominent photo or cropped image (often off to one side) that supports the idea on the slide. Avoid icons, clip art, and busy backgrounds. Overall, the deck should feel modern, editorial, and minimal: a bold headline, one expressive image, one script-accent word to begin or end the headline, and plenty of breathing room on every slide.",

You don't need to upload a PDF about apples for the LLM to understand what an apple or a fruit is.\n\nNotebookLM isn't a closed knowledge vacuum, there's still an LLM in the loop (a Gemini model) which of course is trained on a vast amount of knowledge. The notebook environment is designed to primarily work with uploaded sources, but it's still fundamentally baked in with broader information that comes with an LLM when you're chatting or generating studio output. So if you ask about some (in your case) legal law concept, it can reference a wider slice of it's existing knowledge. It didn't \"google it on the spot,\" if that's how you're interpreting it?\n\nImportantly: There's no such thing as \"hallucination-proof,\" with AI, that's wasn't a good assumption to begin with (which hey, all this stuff is rapidly evolving and complicated, it's a totally understandable confusion!).",

As far as my experience goes, however, it only pulls outside information to further explain a point but it doesn’t add points or topics straight up from itself.",

I made a Cuban Coffee today with my Aeropress that blew my wife and I away. \nI built another with as many independent and college radio stations on the planet that I can find. I loaded it with genre info and now loading station schedules, I can get a curated schedule of music to listen to from around the globe any time I want. \n\nI can't wait to continue building these, they are evergreen and I can't ever see being \"done\" but the satisfaction of the results so far is so impressive. \n\nNow to build one for Costa Rica and have everything I would ever want to know about it before I travel there this summer ",

Best thing about notebook LM is that it will only be restricted to your sources - so hallucination is not a possibility\n2. You first finalise - you want your own source or you have to create a bible document first?\n3. If u r a student - and are tied to a board - say CBSE - then u either stick to your book / or there’s another way - u go to Gemini - choose deep research - write a prompt to build material on that topic which is strictly CBSE based and should not be beyond that \n4. So u either go by your source (PDF book) or u have an intelligent document through deep research (if searches through all possible databases across globe)\n5. Then basis your need - u keep developing outcomes - like - I have discovered that it is best to use mind map - so u get break up of topics - then you ask notebook LM chat option also - to break the topic into meaningful sub-topics\n6. Then u play with the sub-topics in each of LM’s utility features\n7. For prompts to customize the output - don’t apply brain - just go to chat gpt / Gemini and ask it to give you a prompt basis your need and also tell it - which particular feature of notebook Lm u r using - that’s it!\n\nBest of luck with your research.",

I was also expecting this to become a feature that would be released in Notebook LM, including the functionality to add structure with directories and subdirectories in a notebook where you can have between 300 and 600 sources. That still seems to be on the agenda. That would've been relevant, but now that you can simply combine notebooks in Gemini, you just need to create multiple notebooks with different smaller topics. Maybe that even makes them more performant. Either way, it's a way to make Gemini more attractive again by combining the capabilities of Notebook LM with the more powerful models of Gemini and the combination of notebooks.",

This post is old, and I stopped using other chatboxes like ChatGPT and Perplexity, so there's a good chance that many of them now have the features listed below. The overall reason why I like notebook LM is that I can upload my own documents and sources, ask questions, and be very confident that the information being spit back to me is accurate, it's like having a personal AI that is exclusively knowledgeable about the information you feed it.\n\n\">notebookLM provides direct citations to each of its statement, allowing you to personally verify if its interpretation of the information is accurate\n\n\\>Notebook LM notifies you when they're using information outside the sources provided, so you can make judgements about the truthworthiness of the information it's providing you\n\n\\>the information notebook LM provides comes directly from your sources, for chatGPT you typically have to prompt it to do that and even then it still sometimes uses information outside of your source without notifying you which can be annoying\n\n\\>there is some level of consistency in notebook LM's answers i.e if I ask the same question to notebook LM on different days, it will spit out the exact same answers, assuming that I haven't added or removed sources, the same can't be said for chatgpt\n\n\\>it's way easier to create custom chatboxes for notebook LM in comparison with chatgpt\n\n\\>I can add up to 300 sources (with notebook LM plus) in minutes very easily, I can't do the same for chatgpt\n\n\\>notebook LM can actually transcribe audio directly once you import the audio file as a source, I'm pretty sure chatgpt can't do that\n\n\\>I can save notebook LM replies into notes and refeed it back to it as a source which increases its context window allowing it to have even more precise and nuanced answers\n\n\\>this one is my personal favourite but notebook LM is actually really good at making flashcards since it's using your notes as a source, I've tried making flashcards with chatgpt, the quality of the cards are usually pretty poor and it likes to repeat questions in a different wording a lot\"",

NotebookLM does something different: it becomes an expert only on what you upload. PDFs, YouTube videos, docs, whatever. Every answer includes inline citations you can click to verify against the original source.\n\nFor your Data Engineering learning path specifically:\n\n  \\- Upload AWS/GCP docs, YouTube tutorials, textbooks → ask it to explain concepts\n\n  \\- Generate Audio Overviews (podcast-style explanations) to listen while commuting\n\n  \\- It won't hallucinate random answers from the internet because it only uses your sources\n\nThe Audio/Video Overview feature is honestly what makes it unique — no competitor does this. It creates natural podcast conversations from your sources, complete with hosts debating and explaining concepts.\n\nSince you already have Google AI Pro, you have NotebookLM Plus included — 500 notebooks, 300 sources each, 20 Audio Overviews/day.\n\nQuick tip: try uploading a Data Engineering course video or PDF you're studying, then ask it to generate a podcast. You'll immediately see the difference.\n\nI wrote up a detailed breakdown of all the features and use cases here if you want more context: [https://jsonobject.com/notebooklm-googles-accidental-masterpiece-rewriting-how-we-learn](https://jsonobject.com/notebooklm-googles-accidental-masterpiece-rewriting-how-we-learn)",

All of the selected sources are ingested and form part of the Notebook knowledge base, and the resulting response can be saved as a new Note which can then be used to analyse complex topics. An example would be a exploring a business idea, where you first ask it to find you what people on Reddit and other sites are saying about the idea, then about similar products and companies, and then about what are the predictions for growth, etc. until one has a compreshensive basis to ask it questions such is this a good business idea, what is the potential to make money with it, saturation, difficulty, etc, then ask to create a business, marketing, inverstor presentation, a video, blog, cards, you can also create a summary which you can take to other Google or preferred Vibe Coding tool to create a website / landing page, or even an App.",

Also, I think you know as well as I do that something like 60% of all the data for these LLMs comes from Reddit anyway.

For instance, today, when I was out getting paint, I had a few questions about the finish on the paint. Meaning glossy vs flat vs matte. I find that taking pictures and giving it to ChatGPT are extremely useful for items like that. But yeah, I am like you.

But when NBLM was updated that button disappeared and now you have to open each source that resides on your Google Drive and sync from there. It was much better before. I hope I have this right but that’s what I recall and what I see now. I hope they can bring back the batch sync for Google Drive sources.",
