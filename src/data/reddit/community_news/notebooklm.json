When I fed it the complete outline in one dock, it kept missing details, slides, and taking liberties with my presentation. I created the original outline by feeding NLM a huge amount of input, which worked. Creating the slides, it didn’t.",

If you put a whole textbook’s information, there’s obviously, in total, a lot more info that is going to be condense in the same volume of projects as they call it in Notebook LM. For example, the longest podcasts you’re able to upload are around 30 minutes (if you have the upgraded version I think). But if you take a single chapter rather than the entire textbook, you’ll get the same 30 minutes length of podcast but with more depth of information.",

                  "text": "There are probably many reasons. In my experience this is an amazing thing to do.  If you wanted access to the knowledge of the world, you would use regular gemini.  You are using NotebookLM as a hyperfocused self contained AI.  It is usually only using the sources you give it.  This seems to effectively stop hallucinations (situations where the AI creates a variable or deviates and things go off the rails).  Hallucinations often happen when the user doesn't give enough information so the AI plugs data in.  If you say you want a picture of a woman in a wedding dress and it gives you a woman in a red bloody dress, it is more likely because you didn't specify you wanted a white dress and as it looked through the possibility of dresses, one possible dress was some artsy rebel dress it was fed.  NotebookLM, by only using the sources you have fed it, seems to greatly reduce these fetch information from outside interactions and only uses the data you give it.  As such, if you want to study the information in a chapter, you should make a specific notebook for that chapter.  This will make your info graphics and outputs more refined and useful.  If you want the whole book, make a separate notebook for the whole book.  Each notebook will have a use case (broad vs specific). I would encourage you to use BOTH methods.  Once you have put your sources into the notebook and read through everything, made your infographics and gotten through those, go into the middle chat window and put the prompt: \"make a dungeons and dragons type game in order to quiz me on...\\[fill in topic\\]\".",

The same guy that did the above video did this one that shows how to use Gemini Canvas for slides (this has been my go to way for Slides ever since)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Vl2WSfdgeC0?si=WZQG0FCq5Uon1qX1",

Consider though that the primary strength of a workflow in nbLM is it is required to primarily (although not exclusively!) work within your uploaded sources and uniquely provides in-line+in-context citations of where the information came from. \n\nIt's hard to think of any other LLM option out there that encourages this chain of attribution outside an IDE... so while it's important to remember that LLM hallucinations (or bad source information, or flawed prompts) can impact the quality of a response whenever it comes to AI -- it's also important to recognize the role a tool like notebookLM is specifically designed to rely on source information versus existing pre-training knowledge. In my experience, the bigger risk is source quality: garbage in, garbage out.",

      "text": "I could not love an AI tool better than NotebookLM, I use it daily for my scientific research, paper reading, thought gathering, etc.  I also found the way it uses nano banana to generate slides is a transformative idea.  However, I have been getting a hard time to edit the slides it generates, and I tried multiple methods and wasted even more time using those different tools to alter an image.\n\n1, using Gemini or google slides to “prompt” change a page, I can use all of my daily pro/nano banana limit on a single page\n\n2, some online free pdf/ppt conversion tool, it is still image inside of the ppt!\n\n3, Canvas: seems like I have to click on the individual element to change, and needs subscription in the first place?\n\n4, some other tools mentioned online, broke my slides…\n\nI am an engineer, and of course nowadays, a vibe coder (😂），so I asked myself: hmm how hard can it be?  And decided to write my own tool to do so.\n\nIt was a great experience in the process, however I soon know it is not a vibe coding project.  In reality, reverse engineering an image is a VERY challenging task.  With the best vision models and many engineering optimizations and iterations, now this tool is working for me.  Although now I put together as a web app, the model used to achieve there only makes it a barely profitable app unless charge high.  Now I think only if big tech like google can absorb the cost into the api call…\n\nAnyway, just want to share it here and welcome anyone who wants to use it for your work.  If this pain point solving tool can indeed work for more people, it would be fantastic thing for me.\n\n~~Guess I should not promote it with URL so please DM me if you’re interested.~~\n\nUpdate: There are so many people facing the same pain point, so I guess I should not feel shy to share the link here:\n\npxGenius.ai\n\n：）",

For my use case, it helped turn the slides into fully editable content pretty quickly.\n\nWhat I liked:\n\nText stays clean and readable after conversion\n\nSlide structure doesn’t get messed up\n\nEasy to jump in and make quick edits\n\nWhat could be better:\n\nNo batch conversion (had to do files one at a time)\n\nImages sometimes need minor manual adjustment\n\nAnyway, it’s been useful when I need to polish NotebookLM-generated slides right before a meeting quickly.\n\nCurious how you guys handle multiple conversions? Or use other tools/workflows?\n\nMany thanks for any suggestions🙏",

It preserves structure better and avoids text being “flattened”.\n\nFor multiple conversions:\n\t•\tGoogle Slides API + Drive batch import (even semi-manual) scales better than PDF tools.\n\t•\tIf PPT is mandatory, I batch-clean using Slide Master + Find/Replace rules instead of per-slide edits.\n\t•\tFor visuals, I assume light manual adjustment is unavoidable with AI-generated slides—no tool fully solves that yet.\n\nRule of thumb:\nPDF tools are fine for last-minute fixes, but for repeatable workflows, staying native (Slides → Slides / PPT → PPT) saves more time long term.\n\nCurious if Google will expose more granular export controls in NotebookLM—would remove 80% of this friction.",

      "text": "Hello Reddit,\n\nI am excited to announce a huge update on the NotebookLM MCP.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a96lg1kbvpgg1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0ddbd49448c33051ca733f6e0fef63b7c3f4224\n\n**TL;DR**: MCP and CLI are now one package. You can upload & download files directly (no browser needed). There's a skill installer for AI coding tools. And you can finally switch between Google accounts without losing your mind.\n\n**Why the big refactor?**\n\nI got tired of maintaining two packages. You probably got tired of figuring out which one to install. So I merged everything. One install, you get both tools. Done.\n\n**What's new:**\n\n**🔧 One Package, Both Tools**\n\n    uv tool install notebooklm-mcp-cli\n\nYou get nlm (the CLI) and notebooklm-mcp (the MCP server). The old separate packages are deprecated.\n\n**📤 Direct File Upload:** This one was painful to get working, but now you can upload PDFs, TXT, Markdown, and audio files directly through HTTP. No browser automation. For example:\n\n`nlm source add file /path/to/doc.pdf --wait`\n\n**🤖 Skill Installer:** If you're using Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor, or any other AI coding tool, you can install NotebookLM as a skill:\n\n`nlm skill install claude-code`\n\nIt drops the skill file where your tool expects it. You can also run nlm skill list to see what's installed. There are flags for user or project-level install.\n\n**🔐 Multi-Profile Auth:** Each profile gets its own Chrome session. So you can have your work account and personal account without logging out and back in constantly.\n\n`nlm login profile switch work`\n\n`nlm login profile list`\n\nYou can even set a default: \n\n    nlm config set auth.default_profile work\n\n**📥 Downloads That Actually Work:** You can download any artifact type now. Audio, video, reports, slides, infographics, mind maps, data tables. Quiz and flashcards come out as JSON, Markdown, or HTML.\n\n**📝 Notes:** Full CRUD. nlm note create, list, update, delete. MCP tools too.\n\n📤 **Export to Google Workspace:** Data Tables go to Sheets. Reports go to Docs. For example:\n\n    nlm export to-sheets <notebook> --artifact-id <id>\n\nAlso in this release:\n\n✅ Sharing API (public links, invite collaborators)\n\n✅ Dual CLI syntax (i.e, Verb-first and noun-first, for example: nlm notebook list OR nlm list notebooks)\n\n✅ Aliases (use names instead of UUIDs)\n\n✅ Interactive chat mode\n\n✅ HTTP transport for MCP (community PR)\n\n✅ Auto re-auth (survives token expiration)\n\n✅ MCP consolidated to 28 tools DESPITE adding more functionality\n\nThe workflow I'm using daily:\n\nCreate a notebook, upload some PDFs, run deep research, import the sources, generate a podcast and briefing doc, export the briefing to Docs, share it publicly. All from the terminal. No touching the UI.\n\nI'm honestly using the CLI more than the MCP at this point (through AI of course); maybe this will change when more tools have the MCP lazy load. It's just feels faster than the MCP when the AI uses it.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp-cli](https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp-cli)\n\n**Demo**: Check the README for video walkthroughs (or click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQBQigFK-E8))\n\nGo crazy. Level up your second brain game.\n\nHappy to answer questions or hear about bugs. \n\nStill a passion vibe-coding project, still maintaining it as Google changes things under the hood. At least now it will be easier to add and maintain as a unified MCP/CLI project.\n\n",

To work around this, I started splitting prompts into multiple parts and then merging the outputs in Sheets. This significantly improves coverage and completeness, since it forces the model to process most of the document.\n\nIt’s still not perfect, and it doesn’t always go through the entire file. I suspect this is related to context window limits. That said, I’m genuinely impressed by how well it follows structured prompts, and the results are often phenomenal given the constraints.\n\n🤔 Curious to hear your thoughts, comments, or experiences with similar large-document extraction tasks. I’m always looking for better ways to work with big files more reliably.",

You can then turn that output into multiple smaller prompts, and ideally not run everything across all 100 interviews 😄, because that’s probably too much for NotebookLM.  \n  \nI think splitting is the way to go, and then merging the results later. You can use some programmable logic to find uniqueness, de-duplicate entries, and identify the best matches. Even ChatGPT can help at that stage if you’re working in Sheets or a similar setup.  \n  \nIt’s still a bit frustrating and requires some manual work, but honestly, compared to doing everything manually, it’s a HUGE help 🙂.

Important disclaimer, though - I am not very tech-savvy, I discussed the problem with Claude and Claude suggested solutions and then implemented them.\n\nClaude can easily convert the pdfs to an actual powerpoint presentation, but each slide becomes an image. So reordering and deleting is easy, editing is not possible. A workaround - Claude then extracted the text from slides and created a text-only ppt, fully editable. If I wanted to edit something (not much, just some wording), I could copy parts of the text and paste over the \"image slides\", covering the original text. Yes, it's clunky.
