With NotebookLM I can literally transcribe that audio in about 3 to 5 minutes and just check that everything is okay and correct certain things. \n\nFortunately, Google has AI Studio which also helps in that aspect, but this is one of the artificial intelligence tools that I can personally say becomes fundamental and very important. \n\nThe amount of time it saves you on things you've already done but need to summarize, transcribe, organize, create guides, etc., is incredible.",

Let NotebookLM index them so it \"knows\" your project.\n * Connect to Gemini:\n   * Open Gemini.\n   * In the chat box, click the plus (+) icon (the attachment menu).\n   * Select NotebookLM from the options (alongside Drive, Photos, etc.).\n * Select Your Notebook:\n   * A list of your notebooks will appear. Select the one(s) relevant to your current task.\n   * Tip: You can attach multiple notebooks to a single Gemini thread to synthesize information across different projects.\n * Prompt Gemini with Grounding:\n   * Ask questions like: \"Based on my 'Project X' notebook, draft a project proposal that also incorporates current 2026 market trends from the web.\"\n   * Gemini will now use your private data as the primary source of truth while filling in gaps with its general knowledge.\n\n\n💡 Use Case Example: Research to Interactive Dashboard\nImagine you are a researcher or a business lead tracking a new industry trend.\n * The Problem: You have 50+ PDFs and 10 recorded meetings in NotebookLM, but it's hard to visualize the \"big picture\" or share it with a team in a fun way.\n * The Integrated Solution:\n   * Attach your research notebook to a Gemini thread.\n   * Prompt: \"Analyze the competitive landscape from my notes and create an interactive strategy board. Use your 'Canvas' feature to make it a dynamic dashboard with filters for 'Cost' and 'Risk'.\"\n   * The Result: Gemini uses its coding capabilities to build a live, functional dashboard in the chat, but every data point is pulled directly from your verified sources in NotebookLM.\n\n🚀 Why This Matters\n| Feature | Standalone NotebookLM | Gemini + NotebookLM Integration |\n|---|---|---|\n| Data Scope | Only the sources you upload. | Your sources + real-time web browsing. |\n| Output Style | Text-based notes/summaries. | Interactive apps, charts, and complex code. |\n| History | Chat history is notebook-specific. | Persistent chat history in the main Gemini app. |\n| Context | Single notebook focus. | Can \"bridge\" multiple notebooks together. |",

Sprinkle Gems and Workspace tools (mail, drive, keep, tasks, docs, calendar...) on top and throw everything you need to remember at Gemini via Android assistant. I hate that it's Google 😂 but it's working together so well I'm willing to endure Google's stubborn refusal to fix their horribly bad mobile apps. \n\nI use it like this a lot, but tbh still haven't really developed a feeling for how broad or narrow to keep my Notebooks. Learning on the go. \n\nAnd obviously source organization is shit, but there are millions of chrome extensions for it. One open source I've read about earlier would be foldLM, but I haven't had a chance to try it yet.\n\n\n/ETA also don't fall in love, I fully expect Google to discontinue NotebookLM for no reason whatsoever as soon as it's feature complete. 🙄",

You are using NotebookLM as a hyperfocused self contained AI.  It is usually only using the sources you give it.  This seems to effectively stop hallucinations (situations where the AI creates a variable or deviates and things go off the rails).  Hallucinations often happen when the user doesn't give enough information so the AI plugs data in.  If you say you want a picture of a woman in a wedding dress and it gives you a woman in a red bloody dress, it is more likely because you didn't specify you wanted a white dress and as it looked through the possibility of dresses, one possible dress was some artsy rebel dress it was fed.  NotebookLM, by only using the sources you have fed it, seems to greatly reduce these fetch information from outside interactions and only uses the data you give it.  As such, if you want to study the information in a chapter, you should make a specific notebook for that chapter.  This will make your info graphics and outputs more refined and useful.  If you want the whole book, make a separate notebook for the whole book.  Each notebook will have a use case (broad vs specific). I would encourage you to use BOTH methods.  Once you have put your sources into the notebook and read through everything, made your infographics and gotten through those, go into the middle chat window and put the prompt: \"make a dungeons and dragons type game in order to quiz me on...\\[fill in topic\\]\".",

Previously, NotebookLM could only read text (like PDFs or Google Docs). Now, you can upload audio recordings directly into the platform.\n\nOnce uploaded, NotebookLM automatically generates a written transcript of the recording. This transforms your audio from a \"locked\" sound file into searchable, analyzable text. You can then interact with this audio just like any other document—asking the AI to summarize it, find specific quotes, or combine its insights with your other notes.\n\n**Key Benefits:**\n\n* **Searchability:** Instantly find what was said in a clear text format without re-listening to hours of audio.\n* **Deep Analysis:** Use the AI to extract themes, action items, or specific details that might be easy to miss.\n* **Time Savings:** Eliminate the tedious manual work of typing out meeting notes or interview transcripts.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m3p5y6rih2fg1.png?width=854&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad64de558f6cbfab2d852bf91f8c21fad61ef93d\n\n",

      "text": "Hey everyone! 👋\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0fjf9hp9akfg1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8230bce52cb158c1dd3570493560b596e061c40a\n\nLike many of you, I've been obsessed with **NotebookLM** lately. It's a game-changer for research. However, I found the workflow of getting content *into* strictly requiring a PC or manual downloads annoying, especially on mobile.\n\nI wanted to share \"that cool video\" or \"this page of a book\" directly to my notebook without friction. So I built **Share on NotebookLM**.\n\n**What it does:**   \n📱 **Native Share Sheet**: Works with any app (Browser, YouTube, Gallery).  \n🎥 **YouTube Superpower**: It doesn't just save the link. It fetches the **Full Transcript** (auto-generated or manual) and uploads it as a clean text file. NotebookLLM eats this up perfectly.  \n🖼️ **Image OCR**: Take a pic of a book/document -> It extracts the text -> Uploads it.  \n📂 **Organized**: Saves everything into specific \"Notebooks\" (Folders) in your Google Drive, ready to be selected as a source.\n\n**It handles the messy stuff:**\n\n* Removes \"Accept Cookies\" banners from web scrapes.\n* Fixes broken XML in YouTube captions (I wrote a custom regex parser because the standard libraries were failing on some videos).\n* Lets you **Preview & Edit** the text before uploading.\n\nI'd love to hear your feedback! It's currently in Beta/MVP.\n\n**🔥 UPDATE (v0.2): New Features Just Added!** Based on early feedback, I've pushed a huge update:\n\n* **🌎 Internationalization**: Fully translated to **English & Spanish** (Automatic detection).\n* **🔊 Audio Import**: Share audio files (e.g., from WhatsApp) directly. Uploads as audio or **auto-transcribes** to text (if you have an OpenAI API Key).\n* **🎨 New Design**: Complete UI overhaul with a professional, card-based Preview Modal.\n* **🧵 Thread Unroller**: Automatically extracts clean conversations from **Reddit & Twitter/X** (no more messy screenshots or clutter).\n* **🧠 Reader Mode**: Smart web scraping that removes ads/popups before uploading.\n* **📹 YouTube Enhancements**: Better transcript extraction for auto-generated captions.\n\n**Looking for Testers!** I'm looking for people to try this out and tell me what breaks (or what you love). Comment below or DM me if you want to join the TestFlight / Google Play Beta!\n\n>🚀 **Join here:** [https://forms.gle/Tv4i1X6KhiQXb6mV7](https://forms.gle/Tv4i1X6KhiQXb6mV7)\n\nIf you are on **Android**, select that option and I'll send you the APK link via email this week. For **iOS**, I'm organizing the TestFlight slots, so make sure to register so I can send you the invite code!\"\n\n**The videos are slowed down to 0.5x for demonstration purposes.** \n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1qm1tzy/video/6w06mm23r5gg1/player\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1qm1tzy/video/kkmlwm23r5gg1/player\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1qm1tzy/video/4lfkfn23r5gg1/player\n\n",

So I built **nblm** — a skill/plugin that connects your AI coding agent directly to Google NotebookLM.\n\n# The problem it solves:\n\n* 🧠 **Hallucinations** — AI makes up answers instead of citing your actual docs\n* ⚡ **Context switching** — Constantly jumping between NotebookLM web UI and your editor\n* 📚 **Limited sources** — NotebookLM only accepts URLs/files/YouTube, but I want to add books from Z-Library, papers from arXiv, etc.\n\n# Links:\n\n* **GitHub:** [https://github.com/magicseek/nblm](https://github.com/magicseek/nblm)\n* **Install:** `npx add-skill magicseek/nblm`\n\n# What nblm does:\n\n    /nblm ask \"What does our API spec say about authentication?\"\n    /nblm upload ./design-doc.pdf\n    /nblm podcast --wait --output ./deep-dive.mp3\n\nThat's it. Your AI agent now has access to Gemini-powered Q&A grounded entirely in YOUR documents.\n\n# Features:\n\n* Works with **Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Codex, Copilot**\n* One-command install: `npx add-skill magicseek/nblm`\n* Upload files, URLs, YouTube videos, Z-Library books\n* Generate podcasts, slides, infographics from your notebooks\n* Extensible plugin architecture for future sources (arXiv, Notion, Confluence planned)\n\n# How it works:\n\nUses [notebooklm-py](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py) for API operations and [agent-browser](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser) as a fallback for things NotebookLM doesn't expose via API (like file uploads and auth). Would love feedback! What sources would you want to connect to NotebookLM? I'm thinking arXiv, Notion, and Confluence next.\n\nWelcome to contribute via making PRs, don't forget to star it if you like.",

Is NotebookLM under Google AI Pro?\nYes and no. NotebookLM follows a \"freemium\" model:\n * The Free Tier: You can still use NotebookLM for free with your standard Google account. It includes up to 100 notebooks and 50 sources per notebook.\n * The Pro Tier: When you subscribe to Google AI Pro, your NotebookLM experience is upgraded to what was previously called \"NotebookLM Plus.\" You’ll see a \"Pro\" badge next to your profile.\n2. Why the $26.99 CAD price tag?\nThe $26.99 CAD price is the standard Canadian rate for the Google AI Pro plan (formerly known as the AI Premium plan). This is a bundled subscription that includes:\n * NotebookLM Pro: 500 notebooks (vs. 100), 300 sources per notebook (vs. 50), and 20 Audio Overviews per day (vs. 3).\n * Gemini Advanced: Access to Google’s most capable models (currently Gemini 3 Pro).\n * AI in Workspace: The ability to use Gemini directly inside Google Docs, Gmail, and Slides.\n * 2 TB of Storage: Expanded Google One storage for your Photos, Drive, and Gmail.\n3. Can you skip the subscription?\nIf you only need NotebookLM for basic research, you do not have to pay. You should be able to dismiss the \"Join Google AI Pro\" prompt and continue using the free version. The prompt usually appears because Google is pushing the \"Pro\" features (like higher usage limits and the new \"Deep Research\" mode) to frequent users.\nSummary Table: Free vs. Pro (as of Jan 2026)\n| Feature | Free Tier | Google AI Pro ($26.99 CAD) |\n|---|---|---|\n| Notebooks | 100 | 500 |\n| Sources per Notebook | 50 | 300 |\n| Daily Audio Overviews | 3 | 20 |\n| Daily Chat Queries | 50 | 500 |\n| Extra Benefits | None | 2TB Storage, Gemini in Docs/Gmail |\nWould you like me to help you find the specific settings to manage or cancel that subscription prompt, or are you looking for a comparison with other research tools?",

      "text": "Hi, many of you will say, \"CONGRATULATIONS! You use it like 99% of this Reddit user,\" but it's really useful to me. I have terrible ADHD, which makes me quite disorganized with my files. I'm working on my final vocational training project, and it generates a lot of documents, even for my classes, that are required for the project and are completed throughout the course.\n\nBecause of this, I use NotebookLM to ask what's missing, to find inconsistencies, and to help me organize everything so it all makes sense. This helps me put my ideas in order.\n\nI also use it for data analysis and sometimes for doing assignments because I'm short on time and often don't have time to sit down and do them myself.\n\nI have to say it's a very useful tool that, when used properly, is very powerful. Since it doesn't have its own fonts and I only have a partial internet connection, I use it daily. Being able to listen to a podcast in my language on the bus, with very convincing voices in Spanish, about what I have to prepare or study is useful.\n\nAlso, Gemini 3 and the history feature make conversations meaningful and give them a thread, allowing me to ask for corrections and reminders. The ability to build and add on the fly is fundamental for me.\n\nI'm missing something in the package along with calendars, tasks, and classroom to be able to set work times and reach my goals, but I understand that's not its function and I'll have to do it manually.\n\nBut in short, it's the best thing that's ever happened to me, and I highly recommend it.\n\nI just need to learn how to make less lazy prompts and see how powerful NotebookLM can be as a source of Gemini gems.",
