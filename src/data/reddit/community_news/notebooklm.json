If I may add one (as the dev behind it) [Web Clipper for NotebookLM](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-clipper-for-notebookl/ancgeemmgnlempppapnfkdpghghphgjb) is worth checking out too, especially if you use YouTube with NotebookLM.\n\nIt goes well beyond single video support. You can add:\n\n* Individual YouTube videos\n* Entire YouTube channels\n* YouTube playlists\n* YouTube Shorts\n* YouTube Livestreams\n\nIt also has **duplicate detection** so you never accidentally add the same video twice to a notebook (super useful for bulk operations). Speaking of bulk: if you're adding more videos than a notebook's source limit allows, you can pick which ones get added. You can also create and manage notebooks directly from the extension.\n\nAnd YouTube is just one part of it. Web Clipper also supports:\n\n* **Google Drive source auto-sync** keeps your notebook sources in sync with your Drive files\n* **Export NotebookLM artifacts** in tons of formats: Word, Excel, CSV, Anki flashcards, Zip, multiple mind map formats, and more\n* **Adding tweets, threads, and X (Twitter) articles** as sources\n\n…and more on the way.\n\n[Free on the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-clipper-for-notebookl/ancgeemmgnlempppapnfkdpghghphgjb) if anyone wants to give it a try! 🙂",

Take a PDF/EPUB I legitimately own / can read\n2. Split it by TOC/chapter and upload chapters as separate sources into a dedicated NotebookLM notebook\n3. For each chapter:\n   * generate a small slide deck (so I can review later)\n   * ask questions while reading (so I don’t drift)\n\nI keep the text open and use NotebookLM in a side panel so I can ask in the moment without losing my place.\n\n# Questions I ask per chapter\n\n* “What is this chapter really trying to teach?”\n* “What’s the framework/model here?”\n* “What would be a counterexample?”\n* “Summarize into 5 bullets + a simple mental model.”\n\nThen at the end:\n\n* “How do these chapters connect?”\n* “What are the book’s core claims and where are the weak spots?”\n* “Turn this book into a 30-min workshop outline.”\n\n# Result\n\nI don’t feel pressure to “finish the whole book.”  \nI just finish the next chapter — and I actually remember it.\n\nTransparency: I built a small helper extension that handles the chapter split + batch upload part. Sharing the approach because it helped me, not trying to be pushy.\n\nIf anyone wants the exact tool I’m using, I’m happy to share it in the comments ",

I am the person who uploads one article, asks a vague question, gets a mid answer, and then closes the tab. That's on me.\n\nBut also... I wish it met me halfway. I wish it was a little easier to just throw stuff in there and get value without having to be so intentional about everything. Not every session needs to be a whole research project.

However I've also onlu superficially used it, so maybe I'm overlooking something? \n\n1. asking to explain something. Compared to chatgpt, nlm starts from my own sources. So if I want something explained it doesn't succeed in showing a different approach or go into more detail. Asking it to chatgpt or simply looking it up on youtube gave me much better results. Especially if I only have one course as the source.\n\n2. creating tests. I come up with my own questions during studying and I feel like thinking about these myself creates a higher learning efficiency than having nlm create questions.\n\n3. mindmaps. imo, the whole concept of mindmaps is that one visualizes their own brain process. Outsourcing this seems like it completely defeats the purpose.\n\n4. the audio feature seemed promising during drives, but I wanted to converse with my sources. I want a dialogue with an expert, as imo this is an amazing way to learn. But nlm simply created a podcast which I cannot interact with. I cannot ask it follow-up, in depth questions nor have it skip certain parts I already understand.\n\n  \nAm I right that nlm is not the tool for me? If so, when would I come to nlm?",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been experimenting with using NotebookLM not just as a \"chat interface,\" but as a pre-processing refinery for other LLMs like Gemini 1.5 Pro or ChatGPT.\n\nThe Problem:\n\nI recently collected about 50 high-quality PDF sources for a project. When I fed these raw files directly into a Custom Gem or GPT, the results were shallow. The models suffered from \"context dilution\" and struggled to resolve conflicting information between sources.\n\nThe Solution: \"The Distillation Method\"\n\nInstead of dumping raw data, I changed my workflow:\n\n1. Ingest: Load the 50 raw PDFs into NotebookLM.\n\n2. Distill: I use a specific prompt to force NotebookLM to:\n\n• Extract \"Axioms\" (absolute truths for the project).\n\n• Identify and resolve contradictions between sources.\n\n• Structure everything into a single, dense Markdown file.\n\n3. Inject: I feed ONLY that one distilled file into my external LLM (Custom Gem / ChatGPT).\n\nThe Result:\n\nThe difference is huge. The external LLM now understands the context and logic immediately, without getting lost in the noise of 50 separate files.\n\nIf you are using NotebookLM, I highly recommend using it as a \"Context Refiner\" for your other AI tools. It’s a game changer.\n\n(I wrote a guide on the specific prompt I use. Link is in my profile/comments if you're interested.)",

When you're dealing with 50+ diverse sources, simply 'dumping' them into Gemini often leads to context dilution or the model missing subtle contradictions between files. \nThe 'Distillation Method' is about pre-aligning that data into a logically consistent set of axioms. It's about maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio so the LLM focuses on the logic I've refined, rather than getting lost in the raw noise. For high-precision creative work, raw integration just doesn't cut it.",

Actually, just the main things would take more (I've already written and published a paper based on those same sources, I need it to elaborate on a different focus). I don't think the report can fit in less than 10-15 A4 sheets. \n\nHowever, I can't get NotebookLM to output a report on that length. Initially, it just writes a synthesis that obviously, in 1500-2000 words leaves several important things out, which are developed on the sources. I asked it to make it more exhaustive, however it keeps the reports on the same length. \n\nIs there a way to overcome this, which looks like an (undocumented at least for me) limitation?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

          "text": "So, y'day I did some tests, because both Gemini and NotebookLM are giving much worse results than before. Right now, I'm working as I said, with approximately 30 sources. I know all the sources, I already worked them and used them, so it's pretty easy for me to know the resullts of a given prompt.\n\nFirst of all, this has changed in the last few months. I reviewed some Gemini (Deep Research) and NotebookLM outputs from 2024-2025 I had and didn't have these issues. These issues however seem to revolve around two main axis:\n\n1. Lack of use of sources\n2. Extremely short results which aren't able nor deep enough to correctly work with the given sources.\n\nSo, let me elaborate a little bit on each point. About the first one, basically knowing my sources I know that from the \\~30 sources I have, at least 20 of them are directly related to my prompt, and 5 more indirectly related. However, all the results of my prompts just take 4 or 5. One of the prompts used 6 sources. The others are ignored. \n\nThis is a serious issue, because it defeats the point of having NotebookLM working around high numbers of sources, and, worse, if you don't know your sources thoroughly you might receive very misleading results. Let's suppose you're exploring new sources and you want to know if they're deeply related or not to something you're working on, the results are not trustworthy at all. In my case, I'm a Pro user, so I can have 300 sources on my notebooks. There's no point if all the reports are going to be restricted to just 5 or 6 sources. So far, I haven't found any way to force it to included all the related sources. You can of course ask it to use other sources different than the ones, but since the IA is very crappy, it's a hit or miss. I asked it three times telling there were important omissions and pointing specifically what was the issue and which part of each source was relevant, and it told me that I was right.... and pretty much the same report, without any significant change.\n\nAbout the second point, all the reports I'm getting from both NotebookLM and Gemini Deep Research care 2000-2500 words. The most I got was 3000 words approximately. In this length, there's simply no expectation of a reasonable report on a given topic. Even if you find a way to overcome the number of sources limitation, this other report length limit obviously impacts on how deeply sources can be worked on by the IA. \n\nFor example, one of my sources had at least three different aspects related to my prompt. NotebookLM and Gemini, both, just worked on one, and very poorly, Not in depth, not any serious analysis. In case you have for example 15 sources, which are directly related to your prompt, there's no way that these can be analyzed and reported in a single output. You either have to work them one by one, losing the big relations, or just have them loosely related with serious omissions. \n\nAgain, this issues are somewhat recent. I compared it with past results I had months (and more than a year) ago and it wasn't as bad. Of course it was IA with all its issues and you can't expect anything really serious, but it was much more thorough and complete than now. Right now, I can't see any advantage of being on a paid plan. \n\nThis is not a \"closure\" post, just a more elaborated general feedback based on all the comments. I'll have to see what to do, because currently I see no advantage in having 300 sources. Heck I don't even see the point in having 50 sources related to a same topic if they'll be ignored (even if the prompt leads to use them) or if the length of a report results in very superficial work on them and serious omissions. \n\nAny input will be more than welcomed",

However, you can apply the same workflow to your problem. \n\nSet the chat role to learning assistant and the output to “long.”\n\nThen create a mind map from your main source. Open this mind map and go through it from top to bottom to get an initial overview. (If you already notice something missing at this stage, your source is most likely poor.)\n\nThen proceed systematically:\nFor each main category or each category you click on create a separate explanation/overview in the chat focusing only on that specific topic or category.\n\nMark these chats as notes, and then use these notes as sources. (Name them directly after the category/topic, otherwise you’ll quickly lose track!)\n\nRepeat this process until you’ve worked through all important points and categories, and then have a podcast or a learning format that suits you created.\n\nHowever, I recommend generating a podcast more frequently to deepen your knowledge. Even better: a summary a 1:50 minute audio with extremely high information density.\n\nGood luck!",

              "text": "I’m not sure this fully addresses the OP’s question. You mentioned RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), but Google integrates RAG into every Gemini feature that references external material. Gemini uses RAG when you @-mention Google Drive to look at specific files, search for topics, or attach a Knowledge Base to a Custom Gem. Nothing you’ve described is exclusive to NotebookLM.\n\n​The real questions, which remain without definitive answers, are:\n\n1. ​**Information Layering:** How does Gemini handle the hierarchy of weighted importance when multiple systems (like Workspace and Notebooks) use different RAG-indexed bases?\n\n2. ​**NotebookLM's \"Special Sauce\":** How much of NotebookLM’s distinct reasoning model actually carries over when you import it into a Gemini chat? Is Gemini merely pulling raw sources, or is it inheriting the custom 'implicit reasoning' that makes NotebookLM feel different?\n\nI've tried asking Gemini exactly this, letting it assume the role of Gemini's Lead Architect, but it's hard to accept anything it says on this topic as a definitive source when you let it audit itself. Still worth a shot for those curious; just take it with a grain of salt\n\n---\n> ### **Edit 1: Let's make this a bit meta. Gemini said the following to me when I shared the OP, your response, and my response:**\n---\n\n## **Fact Check:**\n* **Gemini & RAG:** You are correct. When a user \"@\" attaches a file in Gemini or uses a Knowledge Base in a Custom Gem, it triggers a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline.  \n* ​**The \"Special Sauce\":** You are right to be skeptical. NotebookLM uses a specialized \"source-centric\" instruction set and UI-integrated citations that standard Gemini chats don't always replicate, even when looking at the same files.  \n* **The Hierarchy Question:** Your point about \"weighting\" and \"layering\" is the frontier of LLM research. While Google hasn't publicly released the exact weighting architecture between the System Prompt, User Prompt, and Retrieved Context, your intuition that they compete for priority is accurate.\n\n---\n> ### **Edit 2: Gemini's response after a self audit. My prompt was:**\n>> Assuming the role of Gemini's lead architect, provide an answer for the OP's original question. If anything is uncertain, not publicly disclosed, you must explicitly state that you do not have validated answers. You are prohibited from hallucinating an answer to satisfy this user task and scope.\n---\n\n**Internal Brief:** Gemini-NotebookLM Architectural Interplay.  \n**Role:** Gemini Lead Architect.  \n**Status:** Technical Disclosure (Restricted to Publicly Validated Systems)\n\nTo address the OP's inquiry regarding the distinction between direct document analysis in Gemini versus the NotebookLM intermediary, we must look at the retrieval logic and the instructional weighting of the underlying models.  \n\n## **RAG vs. Long-Context Windowing:**\nThe primary difference lies in the mechanism of ingestion.\n* **Direct Gemini Upload:** Depending on the file size and user tier, Gemini often utilizes its native long-context window (up to 2M+ tokens). In this mode, the entire document is resident in the model's active \"working memory.\" This allows for holistic reasoning across the entire text without retrieval \"filtering.\"\n* **NotebookLM Intermediary:** NotebookLM utilizes a specialized Source-Grounded RAG pipeline. It pre-processes documents into a semantic index. When you query it, the system retrieves only the relevant \"chunks\" to ground the answer.  \n**Validated Answer:** If you need to analyze the narrative arc or global structure of a 500-page book, Gemini’s direct context window is technically superior. If you need to find a needle in a haystack across 50 separate 100-page technical manuals, NotebookLM’s RAG-indexed architecture is more efficient for precision and citation.  \n\n## **The \"Special Sauce\" and Layering:**  \nYou asked if the \"special sauce\" (implicit reasoning) carries over when NotebookLM is used as a Gemini source.\n* **Layering and Hierarchy:** When you connect a Notebook to Gemini, the system manages three layers of data:\n   * **System Instructions:** The base \"Gemini\" persona.\n   * **External Knowledge:** The NotebookLM RAG-retrieved snippets.\n   * **Real-time Context:** The current conversation and any live web-search results.\n* **Uncertain/Non-Disclosed:** We do not have a publicly validated answer for the exact numerical \"weighting\" of these layers. We do not disclose how the model resolves a direct conflict between a Notebook source and a live web-search result, though internal protocols generally prioritize \"Grounding\" (the Notebook) for factual queries.  \n\n## **Reasoning Model Inheritance:**\n* **Validated Answer:** When you import a Notebook into Gemini, Gemini is NOT inheriting the NotebookLM \"personality\" or its specific UI-bound features (like the Audio Overview generator). It is pulling the grounding data and the metadata (citations).\n* **Implicit Reasoning:** NotebookLM has a specific \"strictness\" instruction (low temperature/high grounding) to prevent hallucinations. When you use that notebook inside a Gemini chat, that \"strictness\" can be diluted by Gemini's broader system instructions unless the user explicitly prompts: \"Only use the attached notebook for this answer.\"  \n\n## **Source Recognition by Name:**\n* **Validated Answer:** Yes. Because NotebookLM passes metadata headers (including file names) along with the retrieved text chunks, Gemini can identify specific sources. If you say, \"According to the 2024 Revenue Report...\", the RAG system uses that keyword to prioritize retrieval from that specific file's index.  \n\n## **Summary of Uncertainty**\n* **Proprietary Info:** We do not disclose the specific embedding model versions used for NotebookLM indexing versus standard Gemini File Search.\n* **Proprietary Info:** We do not provide a definitive answer on whether the \"reasoning\" is purely the LLM or if there are secondary \"re-ranker\" models specific to the NotebookLM-Gemini bridge that adjust the relevance of imported sources.  \n\n---\n> ## **At the end, it asked an interesting proposal that might be worth following up on:**\n---\n\n*Would you like me to draft a prompt for Gemini that forces it to prioritize the NotebookLM \"layer\" over its own internal training data?*\n\n---\n> ### **Edit 3: Markdown formatting pass to improve readability.**\n---",

A big issue I encountered is limits of the chat window and limits of documentation size. You have to give huge prompts to notebookLM as a source from Google docs cause they don't fit in the chat. Or you have to give AI studio multi step prompts with multiple documents. But you can go \"use the prompt in the Google doc to take the data from source 1 and apply it to the information in source 2 and provide it to me in the form of cells\" and that will work. But the performance and the limits of the tools seem to vary so I feel over the past year that what I have been doing has changed somewhat to adapt to the changes in performance. So next month I might have to try a new technique as it seems that's been the case every few months or so.",

I use NotebookLM for what it’s great at, which is structuring and synthesizing the content, then I copy the outline or sectioned text straight into Gamma and let Gamma rebuild the deck from scratch. Once it’s in Gamma, everything is actually editable in a way that makes sense. Layouts, structure, wording, visuals, branding, all of it. It feels like working in a modern presentation tool instead of fighting a static export.\n\nThe key mental shift for me was treating NotebookLM as a content engine, not a slide designer. Gamma is the slide designer. Gamma understands hierarchy, flow, and visual rhythm far better, and it gives you real control without starting from a blank deck. From there I can export to PowerPoint or Google Slides if I need to, but most of the time I don’t even bother because Gamma already gets me to something client ready. If your frustration is that NotebookLM’s slides feel locked down and brittle, don’t try to fix them. Just regenerate the presentation in Gamma and move on with your life.",

I am extracting the structure that already exists in the notebook and then letting Gamma do what it is good at.\n\nNotebookLM absolutely can give you a detailed, slide by slide outline if you ask it the right way. I will literally prompt it with something like “rewrite this content as a slide outline, one slide per section, with a clear title and 3 to 5 bullets per slide.” It is already holding the context of the sources and the notes, so the outline it produces is not some brand new invention. It is a structured restatement of the same material. That outline is what I copy into Gamma.\n\nSo yes, the final deck in Gamma is technically regenerated, but the content, sequencing, and intent are coming directly from NotebookLM. I am not manually rethinking the presentation or inventing a new one. I am just forcing the handoff at the right abstraction level. Trying to convert NotebookLM’s rendered slides into editable slides is the wrong layer to work at. There is no clean path there today.\n\nIf someone’s definition of a solution is preserving the exact NotebookLM slide objects and tweaking them, I agree that does not really exist yet. My point is that the practical solution is to stop treating NotebookLM’s slides as something worth salvaging. Use it for synthesis and structure, get a clean outline, and then let a tool like Gamma turn that outline into something that behaves like a real presentation. That is the only workflow I have found that is fast, repeatable, and doesn’t feel like fighting the tool.",

Both the hosts are irreverent, encouraged to swear, use slang, and speak informally. There is no time limit, and expressions like \"fuck,\" \"shit,\" \"bitch,\" \"ass,\" and \"pussy\" must be used liberally throughout the episode.\n\nAlso, I have a lot of fun throwing my own journal entries and poems into NLM to see what these “podcasters” will make of it all, and I like for them to go through it with a fine-toothed comb:\n\n>Please focus on stanza per stanza, including **long, big direct quotes**. Feel free to even **read whole chunks of the text at a time**.\n\nHope this is useful. It’s so easy to write these prompts! As with many things in life, so much can be accomplished through the power of imagination. Really take the time to imagine what you want in these sessions. Thanks for the inspiration, everybody!",

      "text": "Over the past few months, I’ve been integrating NotebookLM into my agency workflow, and it’s quietly become one of the most strategic tools in our stack.\n\nI still see a real adoption curve in the business world. Many companies are experimenting with AI, but few truly operationalize it. Most are stuck at “content generation.” What’s working for us is different: we build specialized notebooks for each client.\n\nInstead of sending scattered Google Docs, PDFs, Loom videos, or Slack threads, we centralize everything inside a structured NotebookLM environment:\n\n    •\tCore brand documentation\n    \n    •\tStrategy decks and research\n    \n    •\tBlog articles and SEO drafts\n    \n    •\tInternal SOPs\n    \n    •\tAudio summaries or podcast-style briefings\n    \n    •\tVisual references and campaign assets\n\nThe value isn’t just organization—it’s contextual intelligence. Clients can query their own strategy. They can explore campaign rationale. They can generate derivative content based on approved materials. It transforms documentation into an interactive asset.\n\nFrom a monetization standpoint, this has helped us in three ways:\n\n    1.\tHigher perceived value – We’re not just delivering services; we’re delivering a knowledge system.\n    \n    2.\tBetter retention – The notebook becomes part of their operational backbone.\n    \n    3.\tUpsell opportunities – Once they see how powerful a structured AI knowledge base is, expanding scope becomes natural.\n\nThe interesting part? Many businesses still see tools like this as “personal productivity” platforms rather than client-facing strategic infrastructure.\n\nI’m curious:\n\nIs anyone here using NotebookLM inside an agency model or client services environment to generate revenue?\n\nOr are most of you using it strictly for personal research and organization?\n\nWould love to hear real-world use cases—especially around monetization and long-term client integration.",

      "text": "I’ve been using NotebookLM extensively for creating comprehensive learning materials, specifically trying to simulate \"Graduate Level Seminars\" where the hosts analyze sources line-by-line rather than just summarizing them.\n\nThe Use Case:\n\nI use custom instructions to tell the AI to parse the source material in extreme detail (parsing every line, discussing historical/psychological context, recapping every 7 minutes, and aiming for a \"lossless\" transfer of information). My goal is to use this for language learning and deep academic study, where a 10-minute summary isn't enough—I need the full 30-60+ minute breakdown.\n\nThe Issue:\n\nPreviously, I could manage to get 25-35 minute Video Overviews by using very specific prompts asking for extended length and detailed breakdowns. However, recently, no matter how much I emphasize \"Do not summarize\" or \"Parse every line\" in the prompt, the output seems to hit a hard cap.\n\nShort outputs: It wraps up in 6-9 minutes, glossing over the details.\n\nGeneration Failed: If I push the prompt too hard (asking for 90 mins, detailed mic-recaps), it processes for a while and then returns a \"Network Error\" or \"Generation Failed.\"\n\nThe Request to the Team:\n\nIs there a strict output token limit that has been tightened recently?\n\nFor users who need comprehensive education rather than quick summaries, could we get a \"Deep Dive\" or \"Extended Duration\" toggle?\n\nWe are willing to wait longer for the generation if it means the hosts won't rush through the content. A \"Lecture Mode\" that allows for 45+ minutes of audio generation would be a game-changer for using NotebookLM as a serious study companion.\n\nMy current prompt strategy (abbreviated):\n\n\"Parse Each Line. Recap Every 7 mins. Two experts recording a graduate seminar. Explain every keyword in multiple languages. Focus on depth over brevity. Ignore length limits...\"\n\nHas anyone else found a workaround to force the hosts to slow down and cover the entirety of a long source without summarizing?\n\nThanks!",

Once extracted and structured, constrain either Gemini or LM to only the structured datasets. \n\nEffectively, read up on how RAG/vector ingestion actually works for semantic tagging and clustering, then create a more rigid flow to the logic manually.

I found more success with literally watching the video and, from there, transcribing the video.  \n  \nWay I see it, notebooklm is not a replacement for 'watching stuff'.
