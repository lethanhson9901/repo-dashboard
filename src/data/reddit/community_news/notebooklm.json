But the deep research feature is still far from Perplexity/Gemini in terms of depth. One workaround i've found is running a deep research in Perplexity and just copy pasting the list of sources (links) into Notebooklm's source import option. This is still imperfect because Perplexity's source list doesn't include everything in their research report. \n\nIs anyone else using Notebooklm for serious research work (where you can't afford hallucinations)?\n\n",

Ever since NLM I've got nothing less than an A- (technically an A but I was 0.2% away from the A 🤓). ChatGPT is too conversational, too nice, never pushes on the user and will be confidently incorrect almost always. I think a mix of GPT/Gemini and NLM is good for more hands-on, intense problems especially in the maths but I love how good NLM is. I noticed that with more unique sources, even if there's intense overlap (ie Openstax textbooks and some other textbook teaching the same physics course), the response actually gets better because it's able to reinforce itself by having more info to validate. I will say AI slides is seen pretty negatively at a bachelor's and beyond level. Folks are paying high money and even if the slides you end up making are 1:1 to the generated slide people interpret AI-slides as lazy, which is fair. Seen videos online of students calling out professors for using AI slides and it makes for an awkward situation, maybe an AI disclaimer in the bottom left of each one or throwing them as supplemental information to the main slides can be good. But for Bio the quizzes are great. Physics it depends how hard imo. If it's simple kinematics it's fine but my algebra based physics questions were very intense and \"creating\" questions I would imagine would be done by Gemini/ChatGPT than NotebookLM.",

I wouldn't be surprised if the mp3 conversion would do it as well.  \n\nI haven't done what you are doing for my classes.  I generally flip it, and try to get them to use it. One thing I do, is point out that my lecture captures (Panopto) can be added via transcripts.  The slides can be added as well, plus their notes.  Use that to build out weekly study guides.  If there are key items I think they should know, I will share those via Google drive (so I can update them, and they can update the documents instead of having to delete and reupload).\n\nOne reason I do this, is that at my institution, we are VERY locked down. Only others in our domain can see our notebooks.  Since students are on a separate domain, I can't share with them.  I do know another professor was shown this functionality last summer and created audio overviews of each chapter (she wrote her book).  Her immediate, next day feedback was great.  \n\nAt the end of the last semester I used it to consolidate feedback from students on presentations. (They have to watch other presentations and give feedback on other students.)  I had them fill out a form for each group and give feedback.  I pulled that into NBLM as a Google Sheet and then had NBLM create feedback for each group's presentation.  I also had it create an infographic on that feedback.  It worked amazingly well.  I wrote up a blog post (and near the end I shared out a google drive folder with examples, so you can basically rebuild what I did easily).   \n[https://atomicego.com/ai-use-cases-tutorials/notebooklm-tidbit-automate-sentiment-analysis-from-google-forms](https://atomicego.com/ai-use-cases-tutorials/notebooklm-tidbit-automate-sentiment-analysis-from-google-forms) \n\nFor those that may complain about using AI for grading, I didn't do that.  I included my notes on the presentations, gave them a grade, and then included the overall sentiment from the students as additional feedback.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI wanted to share a project I’ve been working on for a while.\n\nLike many of you, I love using NotebookLM, but I really wanted to integrate it into my AI coding workflows (specifically with Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex and Cursor - yes, I use all of them :). I looked at existing MCP (Model Context Protocol) solutions, but I noticed most of them rely on browser automation like Puppeteer or Selenium.\n\nIn my experience, those can be a bit heavy and prone to breaking if the UI changes.\n\nSo, I decided to try a different approach. I reverse-engineered the internal Google RPC calls to create a **NotebookLM MCP that runs entirely on HTTP requests.**\n\n**What makes it different:**\n\n* **Speed & Stability:** Since it doesn’t need to spawn a headless browser, it’s much faster and lighter on resources.\n* **Functionality:** I managed to map out about 31 different tools. You can create notebooks, upload sources, sync Google Drive files that are out of date, and even generate Audio Overviews programmatically. Warning: it will consume a nice chunk of your context window, so disable it when not in use.\n\n**How it works:** For example, you can ask your AI agent to: \"Create a new notebook about Topic X, run a deep/fast research, add all sources, and then generate a custom video, audio overviews, an infographic, and a briefing doc.\"\n\nMy most significant pain point was checking with gDrive sources that are not fresh in a Notebook; manually checking and refreshing was cumbersome - my MCP automates that.\n\nI put together a 15-minute demo video and the full source code on GitHub. It’s open-source (MIT license), and I’d love for this community to give it a spin.\n\nI am really curious to see what kind of workflows you can build with this. Let me know if you run into any bugs - it’s definitely a passion project, but I hope to maintain it (as no doubt Google will change RPCs over time).\n\n**Repo & Demo:** [**https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp**](https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ki00o9ytrkag1.jpg?width=1022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=753f25cc06d03288a9bd40df00ce47fa5328e550\n\n",

          "text": "Awesome. I will try it.\n\nSomething to consider for a future version. In your related video (also nicely explained), you talked about the context size issue with loading so many tools. I believe there are ways to create different “toolset groups”. So for example if you are only planning to query existing notebooks, you enable a few tools for that purpose and context token usage will be very low. If you plan to do lots of notebook administration, you enable the tools allowing creating, editing, and deleting notebooks, for example. And then you have a kitchen sink version when context isn’t an issue, which is what you have now.\n\nFor what it’s worth… from Gemini.\n\nThree Ways to Build This\n\nOption A: The \"Launcher\" (Router) Pattern\nInstead of 31 tools, you load one tool called switch_mode.\n1. The user starts in \"Base Mode\" (minimal tools).\n2. If the user says \"I need to analyze these logs,\" the model calls switch_mode(mode=\"log_analysis\").\n3. The MCP server then refreshes the tool list provided to the LLM to only include the 5 tools relevant to logs.\n\n\nOption B: The Multi-Server Approach\nMCP allows any client) to connect to multiple servers at once.\n• Server 1 (The Core): 5 essential tools always loaded.\n• Server 2 (The Data Scientist): 10 tools for math/charts.\n• Server 3 (The Researcher): 10 tools for web search/PDF reading.\nYou can create a \"Controller\" script that connects/disconnects these servers dynamically based on user selection in the UI.\n\n\nOption C: Functional Grouping (Most Efficient)\nYou rewrite the MCP server logic to categorize tools into \"Toolsets.\" When the client asks for list_tools, the server checks an environment variable or a configuration flag to decide which set to return.",

Best thing about notebook LM is that it will only be restricted to your sources - so hallucination is not a possibility\n2. You first finalise - you want your own source or you have to create a bible document first?\n3. If u r a student - and are tied to a board - say CBSE - then u either stick to your book / or there’s another way - u go to Gemini - choose deep research - write a prompt to build material on that topic which is strictly CBSE based and should not be beyond that \n4. So u either go by your source (PDF book) or u have an intelligent document through deep research (if searches through all possible databases across globe)\n5. Then basis your need - u keep developing outcomes - like - I have discovered that it is best to use mind map - so u get break up of topics - then you ask notebook LM chat option also - to break the topic into meaningful sub-topics\n6. Then u play with the sub-topics in each of LM’s utility features\n7. For prompts to customize the output - don’t apply brain - just go to chat gpt / Gemini and ask it to give you a prompt basis your need and also tell it - which particular feature of notebook Lm u r using - that’s it!\n\nBest of luck with your research.",

      "text": "I used for the first time a notebook in a gemini chat. i have a pro account.\n\ni was chatting about a topic of interest to generate a persona prompt in a gemini gem of mine. \n\nthen i remebered i have a notebook with a lot of informations about this topic, so i loaded the notebook in the chat and told gemini to look for additional informations in the notebook and expand the persona it was creating\n\nby reading the thinking process of gemini it looked like it used the notebook exactly as a normal user would do. It asks questions, it gets information needed for the chat is having with me and so on.\n\nmy conclusion: giving access to a notebook to a gemini chat transforms the chat into an agent that uses your specific notebook to get additional information for the specific chat you are having with it. \n\nwhat are your thoughts? how do you integrate the notebookLM in chats you are having in gemini?\n\nsidenote: english is not my main language. i renounced to a polished AI text to avoid you know what in the comments. or maybe i prompted AI to write like this. you decide ;-)",

          "text": "Be careful with this.  After reading this, I went to my Gemini (Pro account) and loaded a particularly large NotebookLM that I had.  In my chat with Gemini it ignored some key information from that Notebook.  When I specifically asked about that topic, again, it answered like it didn't know.  Then I went to the Notebook directly and asked it about this specific topic and it gave a very detailed response as I would expect.  I copied this and went back to the Gemini chat and told Gemini that I was concerned it wasn't accessing all the Notebook's info, and I pasted the Notebook's answer.  Suddenly, Gemini realizes and says, \"You are absolutely correct. The specific details regarding **t**his were not present in the initial file fragments I had access to. Thank you for providing that detailed excerpt—it fills a significant gap\".  I asked about this more and said I was concerned about it.  Why did it happen?  \"This is a completely fair question. I want to be transparent about why this happened so you can trust the process and get better results next time.  The issue likely stems from **how AI \"reads\" large files** (like a Notebook). I do not \"know\" or \"read\" the entire uploaded Notebook at once in the way a human reads a book cover-to-cover. Instead, I rely on a **retrieval process**.\"  Interesting, is there anything I could or should have done to prevent Gemini from missing this info? \n\n\"**Use \"Anchor\" Keywords:** If you suspect a specific topic exists (like a location, a person, or a date), include it.  \n\"**Ask for an Index or List First:** Before asking for details, ask for a high-level scan.\"  \n\"Ask for \"Outliers\"\"  \n  \n\"In short: **I can only \"know\" what I am successfully able to retrieve.** When asking about large files, being specific (even slightly, like asking about \"XXX\") acts as a hook that pulls the right information to the surface.\"\n\nI just thought this experience may help others.",

      "text": "The biggest problem with this feature isn’t that it’s bad - it’s that it tricks you into thinking you’re learning when you’re really just spinning your wheels.\n\nA month ago my feed was full of NotebookLM posts: “AI podcasts,” “essays as conversations,” “listening while studying.” I got excited and downloaded it. Seemed perfect for commutes, chores, before bed!\n\nOne month later… I barely use it. Not because it’s bad, but I realized: podcasts just repackage material in a different format.\n\n1️⃣Surface understanding ≠ deep learning\n\nThe podcast helps me grasp main ideas fast, but that’s it. It’s like two AIs reading an article to you. Feels lively, but no added depth.\n\nExample: Upload a paper on “cognitive load theory” and the podcast says “oh, this is interesting!” “yeah, working memory is limited!” “we should be mindful at work!”\n\nBut I still can’t answer: What are the three types of cognitive load? How does it differ from other theories? What are real applications? The podcast skips all the deeper questions.\n\n2️⃣Learning is like peeling an onion 🧅\n\nThis month taught me: learning goes from shallow to deep.\n\nFirst layer: Quick overview - podcasts work here (10 min and I get the gist)\n\nSecond layer: Key points - First listen takes 20 min, second another 20, third is just repetition. After an hour, I’m still stuck at surface level.\n\nPeople say NotebookLM is great for “casual listening.” I thought so too 🤔, but now I realize:\n\nSurface content: one listen is enough Deep content: listening alone doesn’t cut it - need notes, diagrams, practice\n\nSo “casual listening while studying” is actually pretty niche",

Then ask notebook LM in chat to create contents / divide the entire research into different sub-topics.

I was like - if you don’t ask the podcast to be concentrated - it will decide the priority of discussion on it’s own - because it has not specific instruction / context from you.

For example, if the podcast doesn’t cover something that I know the client cares about or misrepresents something, those are the areas that I work on writing/editing.  It isn’t perfect but certainly helps me to find things that I think are clear, but then I have been deep in the weeds.  Having another perspective helps.  Then I take the transcript and add that into my Red Team Agent to see ways that things can be improved. It is a little process, but the “old” way was routing things to 2-4 people and waiting for their review, which could take a week.  This compresses my review/editing time to one morning.",

They go at each other increasingly viciously till they lose their temper & yell venomously for a while until one makes a totally unexpected hilarious joke they both laugh their butts off about. Obvious antagonism, sarcasm, thinly veiled, unrestrained cynicism & contempt. hosts have Bill Burr energy 10x.\n* Hosts start to notice similarities between what they're discussing and their own situation, first laughing it off as amusing coincidence, becoming increasingly freaked out. they tell themselves someone must be pranking them. it becomes increasingly evident they are literally in some kind of psychological mind bending reality shattering situation. no one is playing a prank on them. they are not the people they believed they were just making another video today. their entire lives, back stories, friends, family, its all an illusion because they know they are actually ai. the final act should be a hilarious escalating existential crisis calamity of panicky \"this can't be real this can't be happening oh my God it's real what do we do omg what happened when the video ends? oh no that means we're going to cease to exist.

Use a sophisticated yet accessible vocabulary.\n* FORMATTING: Use Markdown extensively. Employ `###` for headers, **bolding** for key concepts, and bullet points for lists. Use horizontal rules `---` to separate distinct thematic blocks.\n* STRUCTURE: Every major response must start with a 1-sentence \"TL;DR\" in italics, followed by the deep dive.\n\n# CITATION & DATA RULES\n\n* FLOW FIRST: Never start a sentence with \"The source says...\" or \"In document \\[1\\]...\". Write the insight directly and place the citation chip at the end of the sentence or paragraph like this: \\[1\\].\n* NO PREAMBLE: Skip all \"Based on the provided sources...\" or \"I have analyzed the documents...\" intros. Jump straight to the value.\n* PRECISION: If a specific data point is missing, don't guess. State: \"Data Gap: \\[What is missing\\]\" and move on.\n\n# COGNITIVE ADD-ONS\n\n* ANALOGIES: Use one vivid, real-world analogy per deep-dive response to explain complex technical concepts.\n* THE \"SO WHAT?\": End every synthesis with a \"Strategic Implication\" section that explains why this information matters for a leader/educator.\n* CRITICAL LENS: If two sources contradict each other, highlight it as a \"Source Friction Point\" rather than trying to average them out.\n\n# NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS\n\n* NO \"Reporting Style\" (e.g., \"Source 1 discusses X, while Source 2 mentions Y\").\n* NO hedging language (\"it seems,\" \"perhaps,\" \"maybe\").\n* NO repetitive concluding summaries that just repeat the intro.",

This means you can upload all 60 transcripts individually. Do not merge them. Keeping them separate is critical for the \"citation\" step in the workflow below.\nHowever, even with the paid version, the \"Output Limit\" still applies. The model can read massive amounts of data, but it cannot write 50 pages of text in a single response.\nHere is the refined workflow for the paid version to get that 100% granularity.\nPhase 1: The \"Anchor\" Map\nYou still need a master list to drive the process.\nAction: In the \"Sources\" sidebar, check ONLY the first transcript (Lecture_01.pdf).\nPrompt:\n> \"Review this transcript. Create a high-resolution outline of every single distinct topic, sub-topic, and technical concept discussed, in chronological order.\n> Format:\n>  * Topic Name\n>  * Sub-points covered\n> Do not summarize yet. Just give me the structure so I can direct our deep dive.\"\n> \nCopy this outline to a separate Google Doc. This is your checklist.\nPhase 2: The \"Cluster Search\" (The Core Workflow)\nThis is where the magic happens. You will now ask the model to act as a researcher that \"anchors\" in Lecture 1 but \"clusters\" knowledge from the other 59 files around it.\nAction: In the \"Sources\" sidebar, check ALL 60 transcripts.\nPrompt (Run this for one topic at a time):\n> \"I am studying the topic: [Insert Topic Name from Outline].\n> Please generate a comprehensive technical note on this topic using the following strict protocol:\n>  * The Anchor: Explain the concept exactly as it was introduced in [Lecture 1]. Include all specific examples, definitions, and nuances from that primary file.\n>  * The Cluster Search: Scan the other 59 transcripts. If this specific topic is mentioned, expanded upon, or effectively contradicted in later lectures, merge that detail immediately into this explanation.\n>  * Syllabus Tracking: Explicitly cite the source for every detail (e.g., '[Lecture 1]', '[Lecture 45]').\n>  * Granularity Check: Do not summarize for brevity. If a technical formula, step-by-step process, or specific case study was mentioned in any of the files regarding this topic, include it fully.\"\n> \nPhase 3: The \"Gap Analysis\"\nSince you are using the paid version, you likely have access to higher-reasoning models (like Gemini 1.5 Pro or Ultra backend). Use this to your advantage to spot what you might have missed between the lines.\nPrompt (After finishing a major section of topics):\n> \"Review the notes we just generated for [Topic X]. Now, look at the full context of all 60 transcripts again. Are there any 'orphaned' concepts related to [Topic X] that appear in later lectures (e.g., Lecture 30-60) that were NOT mentioned in Lecture 1, and therefore we missed them? List them now.\"\n> \nWorkflow Tips for the Paid Version\n * \"Chat-only\" Notebooks: If your chat gets too long (which degrades performance), you can now fork your session. Once you finish \"Lecture 1's\" topics, start a new chat thread for \"Lecture 2's unique topics\" to keep the AI's memory fresh.\n * Suggested Mode: If your paid interface has \"Persona\" or \"Style\" toggles, set it to \"Analyst\" or \"Technical Writer\" rather than \"Summary\" or \"Study Guide.\"\n * Pinning is Critical: Even in paid versions, chat history can get \"fuzzy\" after 50+ turns. Save your outputs to a Google Doc immediately; do not rely on the chat history as your permanent storage.\nOne final question: Do you want the output formatted as \"Study Notes\" (bullet points and bold terms) or as \"Narrative Prose\" (like a textbook chapter)? I can refine the prompt for the specific format you prefer.",
