I didn't even get my undergrad until I was 50 - mainly because I'm not an academically minded person. My undergrad transcript covers 1988 to 2020, because I hate school, wasn't good at it, and my ADHD just wouldn't allow it. Fastforward to now, and Adderall and AI have completely changed my reality. \n\nIf not for AI (Chat and NoteBookLM) I would never have been able to do law school, at this or any age. NotebookLM was my tutor this entire time. But, I took the time to learn how to properly source and prompt. \n\nI've been able to \"teach\" AI ow I best learn - the 80/20 rule: Concentrate on the 20% of the materials that contains 80% of the relevant information. I've maintained Dean's Honor Roll, worked full time and maintained my family and the small acreage I live on. NoteBookLM was a lifesaver for time management when it came to studying.\n\n,",

          "text": "Most people do not use NotebookLM for three reasons:\n\n\n\n1. They do not know it exists and how it works \n\n2. It has a bit of a learning curve. It is not hard to learn, but compared to ChatGPT, Gemini, or Perplexity, it can feel overwhelming at first because a lot is going on on the page.\n\n\n3. It takes some manual work to set it up properly for studying (such as adding your sources) \n\nHere is exactly how I use it as a university student\n\nFirst off, I would like to say that you don't need any crazy or specific prompting for Notebooklm, because it will not affect it much. Here's why prompting could matter in Gemini and ChatGPT, but not in Claude and Grok; however, for a tool like Notebooklm, I'm not saying it is entirely useless. No matter how much you prompt it, the response will not change drastically in quality. This is precisely because the model runs on Gemini 3 Flash, which is not a reasoning model, and Notebooklm is mostly a tool for studying, learning, assessing, and filtering large amounts of data.\n\nFor instance, if you use a very specific prompt in Gemini GEMS, you will get very different responses, and in Notebooklm, this is hardly the case. Again, precisely because of the Gemini 3 Flash model. In Gemini GEMS, you can use Gemini 3 Thinking, Gemini 3 Pro or even Deep Think if you have Ultra...\n\nThe only reason Notebooklm has a chatbot is to ask simple questions. I'm not saying prompting doesn't help with a NotebookLM; however, it's not necessary per se. The only place where a nice prompt will be needed is when you create the notebook's custom instructions. That will change how you get responses, but within the chatbot itself, it doesn't change much. \n\n\nWhat is Notebooklm great for?\n- studying\n- learning\n- breaking down complex topics or larger topics\n- taking notes\n- filtering sources and information, etc.\n\nMy point is you don't need to prompt it; essentially, you can talk to it normally.\n\nHere is how I use it: \n\nI make one notebook per class. The first thing I do is upload the syllabus. I usually upload it as a PDF or a DOCX, but I like keeping almost all course material as PDFs when possible, especially readings, the syllabus, and lecture slides. Then I keep everything else as text or DOCX.\n\nRight after I upload the syllabus, I create a mind map on the right side in the studio. That gives me a quick visual overview of the entire course without having to read every line of a five- to fifteen-page syllabus. It helps me see weekly topics, assignment due dates, exam info, professor contact details, the course description, and the important course logistics, all in one place.\n\nNext, I name the notebook and write a custom prompt. This is a big part of why I like it. The custom prompt is much larger than most tools'. I think it is around 5,000 to 10,000 characters, and it gives you way more room than most alternatives. ChatGPT Projects is limited to about 1,500 characters, and Perplexity Spaces is about 1,000, so you cannot feed much instruction or structure into either.\n\nThe other major advantage is the context window. NotebookLM has a 1-million-token context window and runs on Gemini Flash. It is not a reasoning model, but for what NotebookLM is built for, it works extremely well.\n\nAfter that, I upload weekly content, either from the start of the semester or in a batch before a midterm or a major assignment. Each week, I upload the lecture slides, the weekly readings, my notes, and my lecture transcriptions. For lecture transcriptions specifically, I upload them as text files. I usually do one lecture per file, labelled by week, so it stays clean and easy to navigate.\n\nA quick note on slides: if you convert a Microsoft PowerPoint into Google Slides, it can mess up formatting and text. In my experience, using PDFs for slides is often safer. If you do use Google Workspace files like Google Docs or Google Slides, it is even better for one reason: if you edit the Google Doc or Google Slides outside of NotebookLM, it automatically syncs and updates in NotebookLM, so you do not need to re-upload anything.\n\nFor readings, accuracy matters a lot. If a reading is more than about twenty to thirty pages, I often do not upload it as one file. I break it into smaller chunks. Chapters are usually forty to fifty pages, which is still okay, but if something is massive, I use Acrobat Pro to extract just the pages I need and upload chapter by chapter. My rule is simple: avoid uploading PDFs over 100 pages as a single file. Smaller files tend to be noticeably more accurate and less prone to errors.\n\nFrom most accurate to least accurate, this is how I think file formats rank for any AI tool, including NotebookLM, ChatGPT, Gemini, and others: text, rich text or Markdown, DOC or DOCX, PDF, JPEG or PNG, audio files, and then video files. If I have something very large that I cannot easily split as a PDF, I try to convert it into DOCX or plain text. For long transcriptions, text works extremely well because it is raw text. Even DOCX is not truly raw text, and PDFs are usually the worst for accuracy.\n\nFor lecture recordings, I use my phone or laptop. macOS and iOS can transcribe using Voice Memos. I also use tools like Notta and Otter AI. Notta has been close to ninety-nine percent accurate for me so far. It can record Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams meetings, and it lets you export transcripts in a wide range of formats, including text, PDF, DOC, RTF, Markdown, and DOCX.",

              "text": "\n\nI label everything consistently so it looks clean in the NotebookLM sources list and in Finder folders. For example, I use Week 1 slides, Week 1 readings, Week 1 notes, and Week 1 transcript. It sounds basic, but when you are managing an entire semester, it makes it way easier to study fast.\n\n\n\nIf a midterm covers Weeks 1 through 6, I select every source for those weeks, including slides, readings, notes, and transcripts. Then I generate study notes with a custom instruction like: follow the chronology of the lecture slides, and for each topic on the slides, use my notes and the lecture transcription to expand with deeper explanation, examples, and discussion. This gives me a structured set of notes that tracks exactly how the course was taught.\n\n\n\nI also generate an audio review set and set it to a long duration with a deep dive style. These audio reviews are basically AI podcasts. They are realistic, thorough, and in my experience extremely accurate. They have even picked up jokes my professor made during lecture, which shocked me. The long audio reviews usually run about 25 to 40 minutes. Sometimes they go past forty, but once it is over, about thirty-five minutes, my attention drops. My routine before a midterm is simple: listen to those audio reviews while skimming the lecture slides. That alone covers most of what I need.\n\n\n\nIf I have a question about something from two or three weeks ago, I just ask the NotebookLM chat. Since it only has access to the sources I uploaded, it is more grounded. It is basically a sandbo, x, and it does not pull from the wey om unrelated chat history automatically, as many other tools do, so it is less likely to make things up.\n\n\n\nFor research papers, I usually make a separate notebook, not the same one as the class notebook. Then I upload the assignment instructions and requirements, my research sources (e.g., scholarly articles), and any notes or drafts I am working on. Then I use it to filter sources fast. I ask things like which articles are most relevant and why, which ones are weakest and why, and which sources do not fit a specific sub-argument. If you are dealing with dozens of sources, or something extreme like eighty academic sources, each being twenty-five to sixty pages, you realistically cannot read everything deeply right away. This is a fast way to triage and narrow down what is worth your time.",

These cut out the generic \"summarization\" fluff and force the model to actually add value to your raw materials.\n\n**The above prompts written by our good friend have been modified.**\n\n# 1. The \"Blind Spot\" Detector (Modified from Prompt #1)\n\n**Why it's #1:** This utilizes the LLM's broad training data to audit your specific, limited data. It tells you what you *don't* know, which is the most dangerous part of studying.\n\n>\n\n# 2. The \"Active Recall\" Engine (Modified from Prompt #5)\n\n**Why it's #2:** Passive reading is useless. This forces you to retrieve information, which is the only way to actually encode memory.\n\n>\n\n# 3. The \"Anti-Illusion\" Check (Modified from Prompt #1 & #3)\n\n**Why it's #3:** Students often feel like they understand a topic when they actually just recognize the keywords. This prompt exposes shallow understanding.\n\n>\n\n# 4. The \"Feynman\" Protocol (Modified from Prompt #4)\n\n**Why it's #4:** If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it. This forces the LLM to translate jargon into logic.\n\n>\n\n# 5. The \"Synthesizer\" (Modified from Prompt #2)\n\n**Why it's #5:** Good for connecting isolated lectures into a coherent whole.\n\n>\"Show me the **Concept Hierarchy**. Create a visual outline showing how the main topic breaks down into sub-topics, and specifically note the logical relationship between them (e.g., 'A causes B', 'X is a type of Y').\"\n\n  \nYou're welcome.

You can stack a bunch of changes before you regenerate, which is nice. And PPTX export finally works.\n\nBut there are a few things I wish someone had told me before I got too hyped:\n\nThe big one: when you edit an individual slide, it does NOT reference your original sources. It's working only with what's already on that slide. Google actually says this in their own docs - \"sources are not taken into account during revisions.\" So if you're expecting it to pull fresh citations from your uploaded materials when you ask for a revision, it won't.\n\nAlso - can't add or remove slides yet. You can change the text, rearrange the layout, update visuals, but the number of slides is locked. Worth knowing upfront.\n\nDaily limit on regenerations exists but Google hasn't said exactly how many. People in this sub are reporting hitting it somewhere between 10-20 decks a day.\n\nOh and it's PRO and ULTRA only right now. Free tier is coming \"soon\" with no actual date. And if you're paid but still don't see it - still rolling out, I'm Pro and mine isn't live yet either.\n\nGoogle Slides export is announced but not there yet.\n\nOverall: genuinely useful update, not vaporware. The workflow does change in a real way. Just don't go rebuilding your whole process around it without understanding the source limitation thing first.\n\nAnyone else already have it live? Curious if the experience matches this.",

      "text": "**TL;DR:** Splitting a book into chapters before importing to NotebookLM lets me generate chapter slide decks and ask questions while reading, so I finish (and remember) more.\n\n# What finally made books stick for me\n\nI stopped treating a book like one giant thing and started treating it like a set of chapters I can actually complete.\n\nThe key is: **split by chapter first**, then work chapter-by-chapter inside NotebookLM.\n\n# My workflow\n\n1. Take a PDF/EPUB I legitimately own / can read\n2. Split it by TOC/chapter and upload chapters as separate sources into a dedicated NotebookLM notebook\n3. For each chapter:\n   * generate a small slide deck (so I can review later)\n   * ask questions while reading (so I don’t drift)\n\nI keep the text open and use NotebookLM in a side panel so I can ask in the moment without losing my place.\n\n# Questions I ask per chapter\n\n* “What is this chapter really trying to teach?”\n* “What’s the framework/model here?”\n* “What would be a counterexample?”\n* “Summarize into 5 bullets + a simple mental model.”\n\nThen at the end:\n\n* “How do these chapters connect?”\n* “What are the book’s core claims and where are the weak spots?”\n* “Turn this book into a 30-min workshop outline.”\n\n# Result\n\nI don’t feel pressure to “finish the whole book.”  \nI just finish the next chapter — and I actually remember it.\n\nTransparency: I built a small helper extension that handles the chapter split + batch upload part. Sharing the approach because it helped me, not trying to be pushy.\n\nIf anyone wants the exact tool I’m using, I’m happy to share it in the comments\n\nEdited: I’ve started using the same approach for long web articles too — especially image-heavy or paywalled (but legitimately accessed) pieces — batching them into NotebookLM and generating per-article slide decks.\n\nIf that’s more relevant to you than books, I wrote about that workflow here:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooklm/comments/1r5iw7a/how\\_i\\_use\\_notebooklm\\_for\\_serious\\_article\\_digestion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooklm/comments/1r5iw7a/how_i_use_notebooklm_for_serious_article_digestion/)\n\nSame idea, different input source.",

But the editing situation has been driving me crazy.\n\nWhen they first dropped slides there was basically no editing at all, and the recent update helped but it's still fully AI-dependent - you're instructing changes slide by slide rather than just...making them. I wanted to be able to move things around, tweak text directly, adjust layout and test multiple changes without going back and forth with prompts.\n\nTried Canva's grab text feature for the image slides but honestly found it clunky for elements specifically.\n\nStumbled across a workaround today on reddit that actually solved it for me - uploaded the notebookLM PDF to a converter tool and it turned the image-based slides into fully editable ones. Meaning I could directly edit text, move elements, touch the layout - and I got to do all this without consuming credits so basically on their free tier. Exported to PowerPoint and the editability carried over too, which was the main thing I needed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e9nvpsdd7ikg1.png?width=1844&format=png&auto=webp&s=07652bc210506d791c10f88a15c19eb02133cac7\n\nSharing in case anyone else is looking to solve the same problem - [https://app.getalai.com/notebooklm](https://app.getalai.com/notebooklm)",

The issue is it needs to regenerate the images with any text you’ve edited and it destroys the formatting when it does that. The first two slides I tried, it changed all the colors and did not keep the slide integrity.\n\nEditing via NotebookLM and regenerating the slide seems superior to the Alai solution. Neither are close to a full Google slides or PowerPoint export that is able to be edited.",

As it was responding in the chat with the adapted prompt, the Video Overview Explainer kicked off in the the studio. This approach seems to be more efficient than asking Gemini to optimize the prompt and attaching the NBLM notebook.

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been experimenting with using NotebookLM not just as a \"chat interface,\" but as a pre-processing refinery for other LLMs like Gemini 1.5 Pro or ChatGPT.\n\nThe Problem:\n\nI recently collected about 50 high-quality PDF sources for a project. When I fed these raw files directly into a Custom Gem or GPT, the results were shallow. The models suffered from \"context dilution\" and struggled to resolve conflicting information between sources.\n\nThe Solution: \"The Distillation Method\"\n\nInstead of dumping raw data, I changed my workflow:\n\n1. Ingest: Load the 50 raw PDFs into NotebookLM.\n\n2. Distill: I use a specific prompt to force NotebookLM to:\n\n• Extract \"Axioms\" (absolute truths for the project).\n\n• Identify and resolve contradictions between sources.\n\n• Structure everything into a single, dense Markdown file.\n\n3. Inject: I feed ONLY that one distilled file into my external LLM (Custom Gem / ChatGPT).\n\nThe Result:\n\nThe difference is huge. The external LLM now understands the context and logic immediately, without getting lost in the noise of 50 separate files.\n\nIf you are using NotebookLM, I highly recommend using it as a \"Context Refiner\" for your other AI tools. It’s a game changer.\n\n(I wrote a guide on the specific prompt I use. Link is in my profile/comments if you're interested.)",

When you're dealing with 50+ diverse sources, simply 'dumping' them into Gemini often leads to context dilution or the model missing subtle contradictions between files. \nThe 'Distillation Method' is about pre-aligning that data into a logically consistent set of axioms. It's about maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio so the LLM focuses on the logic I've refined, rather than getting lost in the raw noise.

      "text": "I use NotebookLM a lot while coding — upload API docs and technical references, then query them without worrying about hallucinations. But the context-switching was killing me. Leave the editor, find the right notebook, type the question, copy the answer back. And the bigger issue: when I asked multi-part questions, NotebookLM would often only cover part of it, and I wouldn't catch the gap until later.\n\nSo I built a plugin for Claude Code (Anthropic's CLI tool) that talks to NotebookLM through Chrome. You register your notebooks once, then query them by name from the terminal. The main thing it does differently: after every response, it checks whether your full question was actually answered. If something's missing, it automatically sends a follow-up — up to 3 rounds.\n\nIt uses Claude Code's built-in Chrome integration instead of a heavy headless browser:\n\n- Uses your existing Chrome browser as-is — no separate browser engine to install\n- Reuses your already logged-in Google account, so no extra auth setup\n- Queries go through the NotebookLM UI — no API keys or extra costs\n- Just add `claude --chrome` and you're connected\n\n**Setup:**\n\n1. Install [Claude in Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/claude/fcoeoabgfenejglbffodgkkbkcdhcgfn) extension and start Claude Code with `claude --chrome`\n2. Install the plugin:\n   ```\n   /plugin marketplace add LeeJuOh/claude-code-zero\n   /plugin install notebooklm-connector@claude-code-zero\n   ```\n3. Add a notebook URL and start querying\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n- Browser automation, so each query takes ~30-60 seconds\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/LeeJuOh/claude-code-zero/tree/main/plugins/notebooklm-connector\n\nQuestions welcome!",

You can install it with:\n\n```\nnpm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code\n```\n\nOnce Claude Code is set up, installing the plugin is just two commands:\n\n**Step 1.** Add the marketplace (one-time setup):\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add LeeJuOh/claude-code-zero\n```\n\n**Step 2.** Install the plugin:\n\n```\n/plugin install notebooklm-connector@claude-code-zero\n```\n\nYou can confirm it's installed by running `/plugin` and checking the Installed tab.\n\nBefore you can actually use the plugin, you'll also need:\n\n- **Google Chrome** (or Edge) with the [Claude in Chrome extension](<https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/claude/fcoeoabgfenejglbffodgkkbkcdhcgfn>) — this is what lets Claude Code interact with your browser\n- Launch Claude Code with Chrome integration enabled: `claude --chrome`\n- Be logged into [NotebookLM](<https://notebooklm.google.com>) in Chrome\n\nOnce everything's ready, you just talk to Claude naturally in your terminal. Say `\"Add <your-notebook-url> to my notebooks\"` to register a notebook, then ask any question about your docs — the plugin routes your question to NotebookLM and brings back the answer with citations.\n\nMore details in the [README](<https://github.com/LeeJuOh/claude-code-zero/tree/main/plugins/notebooklm-connector>) if you want to dig deeper.",

I have been using NLM to gather sources along with Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT for two years to develop my lectures, assignments, and other materials. It has very much changed my teaching for the better! I am delivering what I consider world-class lecture content. It is a lot of work but this is a thrilling time to be a teacher. \n\nTip: I use Keynote for my slides. I found a free online script generator called KeynotePro Composer that will take properly formatted markdown and generate Keynote slides. It has really sped up my process of slide generation. This has become an important (and sometimes very nerdy) part of my workflow. \n\nI can share more if any teachers are interested. I encourage students to use NLM often and sometimes there are a few that listen. ;)",

      "text": "TL;DR: I use NotebookLM to turn batches of web articles into slide decks + structured Q&A — but the real fix was improving how I capture image-heavy and already-paid content so nothing important gets lost.\n\n\n\n# Why NotebookLM works (when it works)\n\nNotebookLM lets me:\n\n* Ask questions while reading\n* Extract claims + supporting evidence\n* Generate short slide decks for recall\n* Compare multiple sources in one place\n\nIt shifts me from passive reading to active synthesis.\n\nBut I kept hitting a capture problem.\n\n\n\n# Where things break\n\nTwo cases caused friction:\n\n1) Image-heavy essays  \nSome writing (think Wait But Why, data-heavy explainers, charts) loses meaning if you strip visuals.  \nText-only capture makes the summaries shallow.\n\n2) Paywalled articles I already subscribe to  \nNot bypassing anything — I mean logged-in, legitimately accessible pages.  \nNotebookLM's official capture often fails or imports partial content because of how those pages render.\n\nNotebookLM’s official web capture is primarily text-based.  \nMost third-party batch-import extensions follow the same approach — fast and text-first, but not visual-preserving.\n\nThat’s where the gap was for me.\n\n\n\n# The workflow that fixed it\n\nInstead of relying only on text extraction:\n\n* Clean page → official web capture (URLs)\n* Image-heavy or logged-in page → PDF capture of exactly what I’m viewing\n\nThen I:\n\n1. Paste multiple URLs at once (or extract links from a long directory page).\n2. Import them into one NotebookLM notebook.\n3. Generate artifacts per article (slides, sometimes audio).\n4. Open NotebookLM in the browser side panel while keeping the original article in the main window.\n\nWhile reviewing, I ask:\n\n* What are the core claims?\n* Which visuals matter most?\n* What assumptions are hidden?\n* Where do multiple sources disagree?\n\nInstead of ending up with open tabs, I end up with structured summaries I can actually reuse.\n\n\n\nThis same “break → import → interrogate → synthesize” approach actually changed how I read books too.\n\nI started splitting long nonfiction into chapters before importing into NotebookLM and generating chapter-level slides so I can actually absorb them instead of “half-finishing” books.\n\nIf you’re curious, I wrote about that workflow here:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooklm/comments/1r3l12s/how\\_i\\_use\\_notebooklm\\_to\\_actually\\_absorb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooklm/comments/1r3l12s/how_i_use_notebooklm_to_actually_absorb/)\n\n\n\nIf anyone wants the helper tool I’m using (I built it to solve this capture gap), I’m happy to share in the comments ",

But I subscribed to his premium service and paid the annual fee which at twenty bucks was so value for money..coz that is like just around 1.66 a month. \n\nI feel that the feature where an ebook (pdf or Epub) gets chopped into chapters and then automatically uploaded to notebook LM as sources was a huge game changer for me. I was able to select batch processing where 12 video summaries and 12 infographics were being generated all at the same time. (My ebook had 12 chapters)\n\nPreviously I would upload an entire book and then get a video summary of it. With OP's tool via its premium features, I was able to break down books into chapters and it was so seamless. \n\nCan't wait to try the article deepdives especially for those where I have a subscription like the New York Times, Washington Post and The Atlantic. \n\nI highly recommend OP chrome extension and primarily the premium features.",

NotebookLM found a mention from 1991. off by 25 years.\n\nHere's the thing. if you look at Gemini's thought process it literally says it's searching based on likelihood and prioritizing where the answer is most likely to be. it's not actually reading through everything you gave it. it's guessing where to look based on what it already knows.\n\nTo make it even more obvious, I searched the same question on Gemini without any notebooks attached. same answer. 2016. so the notebooks didn't even change what Gemini told me. it just fell back on what it already knew and ignored my sources.\n\nNotebookLM actually went through the documents and found something Gemini never would have. a 1991 letter where Buffett called Apple a \"Mistake Du Jour\" because tech was outside his circle of competence. that completely changes the story.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1r7gz9j/video/skxhhnxv14kg1/player\n\n",

If she’s using NotebookLM to summarize chapters, generate study guides, and quiz herself, that sounds a lot like using CliffsNotes, flashcards, or a study group. It’s a learning aid. The key line for me is that she is not using it to write essays or generate graded answers that are supposed to reflect her own thinking.\n\nThere’s a big difference between using AI to replace your thinking and using it to sharpen your thinking. If she uploads her own reading material and uses the tool to help organize it, ask questions about it, and test her understanding, she’s still doing the cognitive work. In fact, she may be doing more of it because she’s actively engaging with the content instead of passively rereading.\n\nWhether it is cheating really comes down to the professor’s policy. If the syllabus explicitly bans AI tools of any kind, then technically it could be a violation, even if the intent is just studying. But absent a clear rule, this is no different from using a calculator to check your math steps or Quizlet to drill vocabulary. The learning still has to happen in her head.\n\nThe classmate’s reaction sounds more like moral signaling than a thoughtful distinction. There’s a tendency right now to lump all AI use together as if generating a full essay and creating a personal study guide are the same thing. They are not. One bypasses the learning objective. The other can reinforce it.\n\nIf I were in her position, I would not panic, but I might proactively check the course policy. If it is silent on study tools, she’s likely fine. If it is ambiguous, she could even ask the professor in a neutral way whether AI-based study aids are allowed. That turns it from something secretive into something transparent.\n\nYou’re not crazy for seeing a difference. There is a meaningful difference between outsourcing your answers and using a tool to help you understand the material more deeply. The intent and the actual use case matter a lot.",

Previously, I could handle only three courses per semester and always felt terrible about it. It helps me understand the logic of my academic readings so much better. It also lets me write my essays quickly because I understand the material. I really do not think notebooklm is equipped to even write an essay, at least. I have used it to help me draft an essay outline based on my thesis. For me, understanding the class readings helps me write my essay on my own. Just making the connection after understanding the readings feels amazing. It even eased my anxiety when taking an in-class test because I studied my readings and asked questions when I did not understand a specific part. \n\nI am currently writing a 4,000-word essay and need to cover 30 sources. I use notebooklm to tell me if it covers certain things and point them out to me, so that I can refer to the book and look at the section myself. It benefits my research, so I cite it. I personally do not have the patience to read all 30 sources.  \n  \nIn all honesty, notebook saves time! That's a crucial part of it, and that is why I prefer it. If it makes her life easier, she should be able to use it. The only problem with AI is if it is used to write. Universities do not say anything about using AI to 'read'. However, I would hesitate to use it in a philosophy class or a literature class. ",

      "text": "I have been loving NotebookLM as a research tool and creative studio.\n\nI have a solution that works to edit the mistakes NotebookLM makes on slides and infographics without paying for another too..\n\nThere are some REALLY FRUSTRATING issues that Google could have solved by now for us.  \n\nI have been frustrated because it will generate a stunning infographic or slide deck with just a few misspelled words or insert things like \"Jetbrains Mono\" or \"Inter\" in very weird places.  And this is frustrating because these few mistakes ruin sometimes stunning designs.\n\nAlso, sometimes for slides or infographics the title or some text is just a bit off in terms of wording.  And there is no way to edit it!!!!    \n\nThis Is DUMB!\n\nOf course, I also use tools like Gamma and it does generate nice slides you can edit.  But the designs are not as nice as NotebookLM powered by Nano Banana pro.  \n  \nAnd yes, I am aware you can pull stuff from NotebookLM into Canva but I find Canva more than a bit confusing at a time and shouldn't have to pay for that to edit NotebookLM outputs.\n\nAlso another frustration is you can only download slides as PDF from notebookLM and that is also very DUMB!    \n  \nWhy can't we export to Slides?  Other LLMs like MANUS allow that but NotebookLM doesn't?   This is product management failure 101.  \n\nFinally, if people are on the Ultra plan or enterprise plan putting the NotebookLM logo on everything is really OBNOXIOUS.  They should do like they do for Ultra plan users in Gemini where they don't add the Gemini logo in the bottom right hand corner of every image generated.  \n  \n/venting off   \n\nTHE SOLUTION \n\nI take screen shots of infographics / Slides and add them into Google slides one slide per image.  \n\nThen right click on the image and select Edit Image.\n\nIn the right hand side bar you can then type whatever visual edits or text edits you need.\n\nIt has very good prompt adherence if you give good direction and then you can undo the MISTAKES that ruined the stunning design.  \n\nOf course you can then export slides to PDF or copy the images. \n\nYou can else Edit Images in AI Studio with good adherence as well if you pay for it with the API usage and that works pretty well.  \n\nI have found using the regular Gemini interface the Edit Image is more 50/50 odds it listens to your direction. \n\nAlas, if the product managers for NotebookLM were on top of it we should be able to EDIT the slides or infographics in a sidebar just like you can in Slides without all these extra clicks and mind gymnastics!\n\nSorry for the venting but I hope this is helpful for those who don't want to use Canva or pay for another tool to edit mistakes NotebookLM makes. \n\nI know, it's getting better every month....  And this is the worst it will ever be... \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n",

That was on me. So I spent the last few days rebuilding the flow based on how people actually used it instead of how I imagined they would. \n\n• added a short onboarding [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8jRKPo-WaQ) (sorry for my actual voice, trying to work on my accent)  \n• made the Patch button visible immediately, no need to hover  \n• cleaned up the editor layout so it reads left → right  \n• added slide reordering ability  \n• generate new slides\n\nThe goal is still the same:  \nnot full reconstruction, just quickly fix hallucinations while preserving the original NotebookLM design.\n\nIf you tried it before and froze after upload, the flow should feel way clearer now.\n\nthank you to everyone here who tested it early. Watching how you actually use it changed what I prioritized building next. And if you have any feedback on the features or on ways to improve the onboarding, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\n(link is the same as before)  \n[slidepatch.com](http://slidepatch.com)",
