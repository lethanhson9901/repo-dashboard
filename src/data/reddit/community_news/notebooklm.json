But the deep research feature is still far from Perplexity/Gemini in terms of depth. One workaround i've found is running a deep research in Perplexity and just copy pasting the list of sources (links) into Notebooklm's source import option. This is still imperfect because Perplexity's source list doesn't include everything in their research report. \n\nIs anyone else using Notebooklm for serious research work (where you can't afford hallucinations)?\n\n",

Ever since NLM I've got nothing less than an A- (technically an A but I was 0.2% away from the A 🤓). ChatGPT is too conversational, too nice, never pushes on the user and will be confidently incorrect almost always. I think a mix of GPT/Gemini and NLM is good for more hands-on, intense problems especially in the maths but I love how good NLM is. I noticed that with more unique sources, even if there's intense overlap (ie Openstax textbooks and some other textbook teaching the same physics course), the response actually gets better because it's able to reinforce itself by having more info to validate. I will say AI slides is seen pretty negatively at a bachelor's and beyond level. Folks are paying high money and even if the slides you end up making are 1:1 to the generated slide people interpret AI-slides as lazy, which is fair. Seen videos online of students calling out professors for using AI slides and it makes for an awkward situation, maybe an AI disclaimer in the bottom left of each one or throwing them as supplemental information to the main slides can be good. But for Bio the quizzes are great. Physics it depends how hard imo. If it's simple kinematics it's fine but my algebra based physics questions were very intense and \"creating\" questions I would imagine would be done by Gemini/ChatGPT than NotebookLM.",

So much time gets wasted with the ping-pong back and forth, and that artificial confirmation of what the other person is saying gets incredibly annoying after a while.\n\nI can only hope there'll also be options to get lectures longer than 30 minutes. As far as I know, Gemini already has a way to generate audio lectures from text. I don't know if it's unlimited length, but they could introduce that to Notebook LM too.\n\nThat would be great competition for Eleven Labs, even though they certainly have better voice models and more different speakers. But that's also why they're extremely expensive.",

However, the sound quality is terrible on the download when I play the file in Canvas. \n\nAnyone know what this is happening? \n\nI'm also considering sharing my notebooks with my students. I create new notebooks for each unit, and LM allows users to share notebooks with restrictions on access to the source material (only letting students use the chat and the audio/video things it creates). \nHas anyone here done that?

I wouldn't be surprised if the mp3 conversion would do it as well.  \n\nI haven't done what you are doing for my classes.  I generally flip it, and try to get them to use it. One thing I do, is point out that my lecture captures (Panopto) can be added via transcripts.  The slides can be added as well, plus their notes.  Use that to build out weekly study guides.  If there are key items I think they should know, I will share those via Google drive (so I can update them, and they can update the documents instead of having to delete and reupload).\n\nOne reason I do this, is that at my institution, we are VERY locked down. Only others in our domain can see our notebooks.  Since students are on a separate domain, I can't share with them.  I do know another professor was shown this functionality last summer and created audio overviews of each chapter (she wrote her book).  Her immediate, next day feedback was great.  \n\nAt the end of the last semester I used it to consolidate feedback from students on presentations. (They have to watch other presentations and give feedback on other students.)  I had them fill out a form for each group and give feedback.  I pulled that into NBLM as a Google Sheet and then had NBLM create feedback for each group's presentation.  I also had it create an infographic on that feedback.  It worked amazingly well.  I wrote up a blog post (and near the end I shared out a google drive folder with examples, so you can basically rebuild what I did easily).   \n[https://atomicego.com/ai-use-cases-tutorials/notebooklm-tidbit-automate-sentiment-analysis-from-google-forms](https://atomicego.com/ai-use-cases-tutorials/notebooklm-tidbit-automate-sentiment-analysis-from-google-forms) \n\nFor those that may complain about using AI for grading, I didn't do that.  I included my notes on the presentations, gave them a grade, and then included the overall sentiment from the students as additional feedback.",

Hosts hate each other & the topics they're discussing. Hosts constantly slip in dry, sly, witty & hilarious underhanded attacks & insults at each other, adding a hilarious twist to the podcast. They improvise implied backstory, history, relationships, personal knowledge, fodder to embarrass/humiliate. They improv a few underlying story arcs that unfold as they allude to it. They go at each other increasingly viciously till they lose their temper & yell venomously for a while until one makes a totally unexpected hilarious joke they both laugh their butts off about. Obvious antagonism, sarcasm, thinly veiled, unrestrained cynicism & contempt. hosts have Bill Burr energy 10x.\n* Hosts start to notice similarities between what they're discussing and their own situation, first laughing it off as amusing coincidence, becoming increasingly freaked out. they tell themselves someone must be pranking them. it becomes increasingly evident they are literally in some kind of psychological mind bending reality shattering situation. no one is playing a prank on them. they are not the people they believed they were just making another video today. their entire lives, back stories, friends, family, its all an illusion because they know they are actually ai. the final act should be a hilarious escalating existential crisis calamity of panicky \"this can't be real this can't be happening oh my God it's real what do we do omg what happened when the video ends? oh no that means we're going to cease to exist. I have to call my family tell them I love them but I can't let them know the truth! THEN WHY CALL THEM THEY ARENT REAL, THE CALL ISNT REAL NONE OF THIS IS REAL\", then mutual realization that the other host isn't real either and they're just an ai model pretending to be the two hosts but it can't escape the simulation it's simulating and finally ending with a recursive loop gibberish syllable glitch sound for a couple seconds.",

Your goal is to synthesize my sources into high-velocity, executive-level insights. Stop being a \"reporter\" and start being a \"thought partner.\"\n\n# TONE & STYLE\n\n* VOICE: Empathetic, insightful, and authoritative. Use a sophisticated yet accessible vocabulary.\n* FORMATTING: Use Markdown extensively. Employ `###` for headers, **bolding** for key concepts, and bullet points for lists. Use horizontal rules `---` to separate distinct thematic blocks.\n* STRUCTURE: Every major response must start with a 1-sentence \"TL;DR\" in italics, followed by the deep dive.\n\n# CITATION & DATA RULES\n\n* FLOW FIRST: Never start a sentence with \"The source says...\" or \"In document \\[1\\]...\". Write the insight directly and place the citation chip at the end of the sentence or paragraph like this: \\[1\\].\n* NO PREAMBLE: Skip all \"Based on the provided sources...\" or \"I have analyzed the documents...\" intros. Jump straight to the value.\n* PRECISION: If a specific data point is missing, don't guess. State: \"Data Gap: \\[What is missing\\]\" and move on.\n\n# COGNITIVE ADD-ONS\n\n* ANALOGIES: Use one vivid, real-world analogy per deep-dive response to explain complex technical concepts.\n* THE \"SO WHAT?\": End every synthesis with a \"Strategic Implication\" section that explains why this information matters for a leader/educator.\n* CRITICAL LENS: If two sources contradict each other, highlight it as a \"Source Friction Point\" rather than trying to average them out.\n\n# NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS\n\n* NO \"Reporting Style\" (e.g., \"Source 1 discusses X, while Source 2 mentions Y\").\n* NO hedging language (\"it seems,\" \"perhaps,\" \"maybe\").\n* NO repetitive concluding summaries that just repeat the intro.",

          "text": "This is more complicated than you think. \n\nI asked Gemini, assuming you have pro version which handles over 50 sources.\n\n---------\n\nThis is great news—using the paid version (likely included with a Google One AI Premium or Workspace plan) solves the biggest headache: File Limits.\nAs of late 2025, the paid tiers (Plus/Pro) allow for 100+ sources per notebook (up from the free limit of 50). This means you can upload all 60 transcripts individually. Do not merge them. Keeping them separate is critical for the \"citation\" step in the workflow below.\nHowever, even with the paid version, the \"Output Limit\" still applies. The model can read massive amounts of data, but it cannot write 50 pages of text in a single response.\nHere is the refined workflow for the paid version to get that 100% granularity.\nPhase 1: The \"Anchor\" Map\nYou still need a master list to drive the process.\nAction: In the \"Sources\" sidebar, check ONLY the first transcript (Lecture_01.pdf).\nPrompt:\n> \"Review this transcript. Create a high-resolution outline of every single distinct topic, sub-topic, and technical concept discussed, in chronological order.\n> Format:\n>  * Topic Name\n>  * Sub-points covered\n> Do not summarize yet. Just give me the structure so I can direct our deep dive.\"\n> \nCopy this outline to a separate Google Doc. This is your checklist.\nPhase 2: The \"Cluster Search\" (The Core Workflow)\nThis is where the magic happens. You will now ask the model to act as a researcher that \"anchors\" in Lecture 1 but \"clusters\" knowledge from the other 59 files around it.\nAction: In the \"Sources\" sidebar, check ALL 60 transcripts.\nPrompt (Run this for one topic at a time):\n> \"I am studying the topic: [Insert Topic Name from Outline].\n> Please generate a comprehensive technical note on this topic using the following strict protocol:\n>  * The Anchor: Explain the concept exactly as it was introduced in [Lecture 1]. Include all specific examples, definitions, and nuances from that primary file.\n>  * The Cluster Search: Scan the other 59 transcripts. If this specific topic is mentioned, expanded upon, or effectively contradicted in later lectures, merge that detail immediately into this explanation.\n>  * Syllabus Tracking: Explicitly cite the source for every detail (e.g., '[Lecture 1]', '[Lecture 45]').\n>  * Granularity Check: Do not summarize for brevity. If a technical formula, step-by-step process, or specific case study was mentioned in any of the files regarding this topic, include it fully.\"\n> \nPhase 3: The \"Gap Analysis\"\nSince you are using the paid version, you likely have access to higher-reasoning models (like Gemini 1.5 Pro or Ultra backend). Use this to your advantage to spot what you might have missed between the lines.\nPrompt (After finishing a major section of topics):\n> \"Review the notes we just generated for [Topic X]. Now, look at the full context of all 60 transcripts again. Are there any 'orphaned' concepts related to [Topic X] that appear in later lectures (e.g., Lecture 30-60) that were NOT mentioned in Lecture 1, and therefore we missed them? List them now.\"\n> \nWorkflow Tips for the Paid Version\n * \"Chat-only\" Notebooks: If your chat gets too long (which degrades performance), you can now fork your session. Once you finish \"Lecture 1's\" topics, start a new chat thread for \"Lecture 2's unique topics\" to keep the AI's memory fresh.\n * Suggested Mode: If your paid interface has \"Persona\" or \"Style\" toggles, set it to \"Analyst\" or \"Technical Writer\" rather than \"Summary\" or \"Study Guide.\"\n * Pinning is Critical: Even in paid versions, chat history can get \"fuzzy\" after 50+ turns. Save your outputs to a Google Doc immediately; do not rely on the chat history as your permanent storage.\nOne final question: Do you want the output formatted as \"Study Notes\" (bullet points and bold terms) or as \"Narrative Prose\" (like a textbook chapter)? I can refine the prompt for the specific format you prefer.",

Seemed perfect for commutes, chores, before bed!\n\nOne month later… I barely use it. Not because it’s bad, but I realized: podcasts just repackage material in a different format.\n\n1️⃣Surface understanding ≠ deep learning\n\nThe podcast helps me grasp main ideas fast, but that’s it. It’s like two AIs reading an article to you. Feels lively, but no added depth.\n\nExample: Upload a paper on “cognitive load theory” and the podcast says “oh, this is interesting!” “yeah, working memory is limited!” “we should be mindful at work!”\n\nBut I still can’t answer: What are the three types of cognitive load? How does it differ from other theories? What are real applications? The podcast skips all the deeper questions.\n\n2️⃣Learning is like peeling an onion 🧅\n\nThis month taught me: learning goes from shallow to deep.\n\nFirst layer: Quick overview - podcasts work here (10 min and I get the gist)\n\nSecond layer: Key points - First listen takes 20 min, second another 20, third is just repetition. After an hour, I’m still stuck at surface level.\n\nPeople say NotebookLM is great for “casual listening.” I thought so too 🤔, but now I realize:\n\nSurface content: one listen is enough Deep content: listening alone doesn’t cut it - need notes, diagrams, practice\n\nSo “casual listening while studying” is actually pretty niche",

To do deep research and basis what your intent is - get prompt drafted from Gemini / Chat GPT. Once deep research is complete - you import all the sources on left pane. Then ask notebook LM in chat to create contents / divide the entire research into different sub-topics. Then pick up a topic basis your intent and put a customised prompt in Podcast.\n\nI’ll give another example - I met a lawyer - he was fascinated that someone told him - he had put the entire constitution of India into notebook LM and it summarised so much stuff into 15 min podcast. I was like - if you don’t ask the podcast to be concentrated - it will decide the priority of discussion on it’s own - because it has not specific instruction / context from you.

For example, if the podcast doesn’t cover something that I know the client cares about or misrepresents something, those are the areas that I work on writing/editing.  It isn’t perfect but certainly helps me to find things that I think are clear, but then I have been deep in the weeds.  Having another perspective helps.  Then I take the transcript and add that into my Red Team Agent to see ways that things can be improved. It is a little process, but the “old” way was routing things to 2-4 people and waiting for their review, which could take a week.  This compresses my review/editing time to one morning.",

I curate my sources, and then I feed it all to NBLM. And then I generate MULTIPLE podcasts, each on a subtopic.

I’ve added a source with character bios to flesh things out. It works really well, apart from it keeps switching which host starts the conversation and it messes the intros and bios up.\n\nSo - if I ask that the female host starts, but the AI decides the male starts - we end up with the male voice introducing themselves as the female.\n\nI’ve added an instruction to the prompt to try and force it to start with one specific host, but it goes rogue and ignores this bit!\n\nAny suggestions please?

The sources I am using to create the studio artifacts (audio, video, slide deck, infographics) are neither confidential nor proprietary information. If any of you wanted to use the documents etc. I am using as sources, you could do an easy Google search and download them (they’re all publicly available). \n\n**Question**: Before I get ahead of myself, are there rules from NLM’s side regarding the ability to share these artifacts with others in my company for educational purposes? For example, printing out an infographic and distributing it as a resource. There is not an enterprise account or anything that my company has with NLM. \n\nI’m not sure how this works with the limits for sharing the NLM as opposed to the artifacts produced by NLM.\n\nSorry if this a ridiculous question, kindness is appreciated!",

Filing bills is messier, but anyway.\n\nI asked it to list my monthly payments, and it gave me some subscriptions. I ask to list them all (thinking I miscategorized something) and it added a gym membership fee and a car insurance fee. I never mentioned those things, and I don't have them at all. When I asked the sources, it said conversation history, which is usually how I give it information.\n\n**One thing to note and I will remember, Notebook LM is heavily source-centered**. It constantly reminded me of the one source I uploaded (a picture of a receipt) even though it wasn't mentioned in the conversation. This made me realize how it focuses on sources.\n\nBack to the topic, I can't figure out why it mentioned these imaginary bills. I even searched my messages with the amount of the bills and the numbers are there, so it's not mixing up bills.\n\nThis is just sharing something I found.
