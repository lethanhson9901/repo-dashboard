As it was responding in the chat with the optimized prompt, the Audio Overview generation kicked off in the studio. Then, I asked it to adapt the prompt for the one-presenter Video Overview Explainer Visual Style Anime. As it was responding in the chat with the adapted prompt, the Video Overview Explainer kicked off in the the studio. This approach seems to be more efficient than asking Gemini to optimize the prompt and attaching the NBLM notebook. NBLM is already grounded in the sources and kicking off the request in the studio pane saves clicks and time.",

      "text": "Been using notebookLM for a few weeks now for sales decks and overall I'm pretty happy with it once you nail the prompt. But the editing situation has been driving me crazy.\n\nWhen they first dropped slides there was basically no editing at all, and the recent update helped but it's still fully AI-dependent - you're instructing changes slide by slide rather than just...making them. I wanted to be able to move things around, tweak text directly, adjust layout and test multiple changes without going back and forth with prompts.\n\nTried Canva's grab text feature for the image slides but honestly found it clunky for elements specifically.\n\nStumbled across a workaround today on reddit that actually solved it for me - uploaded the notebookLM PDF to a converter tool and it turned the image-based slides into fully editable ones. Meaning I could directly edit text, move elements, touch the layout - and I got to do all this without consuming credits so basically on their free tier. Exported to PowerPoint and the editability carried over too, which was the main thing I needed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e9nvpsdd7ikg1.png?width=1844&format=png&auto=webp&s=07652bc210506d791c10f88a15c19eb02133cac7\n\nSharing in case anyone else is looking to solve the same problem - [https://app.getalai.com/notebooklm](https://app.getalai.com/notebooklm)",

      "text": "Claude Code and Kimi have these features where you can make different agents with their respective models talk to each other and collaborate. But Claude and Kimi models aren't good at everything, and I started to wonder what would happen if different models from different providers worked together. So that's what I did.\n\nUsing the three flagship models: GPT-5.2, Opus 4.6, and Gemini 3.1, I wanted to test how their three different personalities would mesh if I gave a simple prompt without any guidance or structure. I uploaded my sources (Spreadsheet, Fully loaded PDF with images), and just told them the background of the task and what I needed. I disabled internet access so they can only use the sources like in Notebook LM\n\nHere's what happened:\n\nOpus 4.6, not surprisingly, took the lead. It split up the work and told the other agents their part. Then it did its part and called it a day.\n\nGPT-5.2 ignored the other agents. It decided it could handle the project by itself with its sub-agents, and it did. It redid all the work Opus 4.6 did and sent me back the full completed project.\n\nGemini 3.1 spent most of its time understanding the project and the files I uploaded. I think it got this skill from Notebook LM since the platform is more focused on Sources. When it was ready to work, it tried contacting the other agents about questions but was getting ignored, due to the fact that Opus was done with its part and GPT-5.2 was doing everything itself.\n\nIn the end, Gemini only fixed minor issues in GPT's work after realizing the project was completed.\n\nI'm sure with proper prompting, I could've gotten these models to work together, but I wanted to see how their different personalities would mesh naturally, like a real human team.\n\n  \nHere's the full [post](https://martinovolcy.substack.com/p/i-made-gpt-52-opus-46-and-gemini) for details\n\nHere's the [website](https://showcase.thytus.com/v1/guides) i used to do the experiment",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI genuinely love NotebookLM. It’s one of the most interesting tools I’ve used for working with sources and thinking through material.\n\nThat said, reading through this thread, it’s clear a lot of us are running into similar friction points:\n\n* No real folder structure for organizing notebooks or sources\n* No bulk actions for managing files\n* No easy way to select groups of sources across folders\n* No automatic syncing from Drive\n* Limited control over outputs like podcasts or lecture style flows\n* No real way to act on files beyond asking questions\n\nAt some point it starts to feel less like a workspace and more like a Q and A layer on top of documents.\n\nThat frustration is actually what led us to build something different at [thedrive.ai](https://thedrive.ai)\n\nWe’re building an alternative that keeps the AI reasoning layer, but also lets you treat it like a real file system. You can organize into folders (in fact all files uploaded to root folder gets automatically organized), actually open and view PDFs, rename files in bulk, merge or split PDFs, fill them out, move things around, and even create new documents using plain English.\n\nThe idea is simple: AI should not just answer questions about your files. It should be able to work with them.\n\nI know this is a NotebookLM community, and I am not here to bash it. It is a great product. We just kept hitting these limits ourselves and decided to build around them instead of waiting.\n\nIf you could redesign NotebookLM to solve one core pain point from this thread, what would you fix first?\n\nGenuinely curious, and would love for you to give it a try.",

While that is currently available only at the Enterprise level, there are a few open source version on GitHub.\n\nMore recently, Google announced Gemini 3 has the capability to write apps that combine notebooks to deliver value.\n\nIt is a powerful base tool and is rapidly evolving.",

      "text": "I have been loving NotebookLM as a research tool and creative studio.\n\nI have a solution that works to edit the mistakes NotebookLM makes on slides and infographics without paying for another too..\n\nThere are some REALLY FRUSTRATING issues that Google could have solved by now for us.  \n\nI have been frustrated because it will generate a stunning infographic or slide deck with just a few misspelled words or insert things like \"Jetbrains Mono\" or \"Inter\" in very weird places.  And this is frustrating because these few mistakes ruin sometimes stunning designs.\n\nAlso, sometimes for slides or infographics the title or some text is just a bit off in terms of wording.  And there is no way to edit it!!!!    \n\nThis Is DUMB!\n\nOf course, I also use tools like Gamma and it does generate nice slides you can edit.  But the designs are not as nice as NotebookLM powered by Nano Banana pro.  \n  \nAnd yes, I am aware you can pull stuff from NotebookLM into Canva but I find Canva more than a bit confusing at a time and shouldn't have to pay for that to edit NotebookLM outputs.\n\nAlso another frustration is you can only download slides as PDF from notebookLM and that is also very DUMB!    \n  \nWhy can't we export to Slides?  Other LLMs like MANUS allow that but NotebookLM doesn't?   This is product management failure 101.  \n\nFinally, if people are on the Ultra plan or enterprise plan putting the NotebookLM logo on everything is really OBNOXIOUS.  They should do like they do for Ultra plan users in Gemini where they don't add the Gemini logo in the bottom right hand corner of every image generated.  \n  \n/venting off   \n\nTHE SOLUTION \n\nI take screen shots of infographics / Slides and add them into Google slides one slide per image.  \n\nThen right click on the image and select Edit Image.\n\nIn the right hand side bar you can then type whatever visual edits or text edits you need.\n\nIt has very good prompt adherence if you give good direction and then you can undo the MISTAKES that ruined the stunning design.  \n\nOf course you can then export slides to PDF or copy the images. \n\nYou can else Edit Images in AI Studio with good adherence as well if you pay for it with the API usage and that works pretty well.  \n\nI have found using the regular Gemini interface the Edit Image is more 50/50 odds it listens to your direction. \n\nAlas, if the product managers for NotebookLM were on top of it we should be able to EDIT the slides or infographics in a sidebar just like you can in Slides without all these extra clicks and mind gymnastics!\n\nSorry for the venting but I hope this is helpful for those who don't want to use Canva or pay for another tool to edit mistakes NotebookLM makes. \n\nI know, it's getting better every month....  And this is the worst it will ever be... \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n",

Instead of having to input manual sources into notebook LM, all you have to do is press the source discovery, and you just input the topic you want and it’ll search online and give you a bunch of resources that you can then input into your notebook. Why I like it? Because it’s streamlines your notebooks and it makes it much more efficient if you don’t have time to get manual sources, or you want to study a topic that you don’t have time to investigate by yourself, it will gather all the sources kind of reminiscent to deep research on some models, from which then you can do what you would normally do in a notebook which you could ask questions about it or get an audio overview and so on. what is your favorite feature?",

I'd ask things like how does this character react when they're calm vs when they're angry, or what dialogue tags does the author actually use for them, stuff like that. And then I take what I learn and use it to write or adjust my own dialogue and scenes so they feel true to the source material but still my own version. It's really useful for catching when I'm off  like I thought a certain word fit a character but when I actually checked the books the pattern told a different story.\n\nSo it's basically become my canon accuracy checker while I write. Saves a lot of time flipping through books manually.",

If you just generate Markdown and read it, you’re engaging in passive learning, which is the number one enemy of engineering students.\nHere is a more robust and efficient high-performance workflow:\n1. Context Preparation (NotebookLM)\nDon't ask it to \"write the notes.\" Use it as a tutor-on-demand.\nSegmentation: Keep dividing by chapters. It helps the AI avoid mixing up Fourier and Laplace transforms prematurely.\nCritical Prompting: Instead of \"summarize this,\" use:\n\"Act as an engineering professor. Explain the concept of [Concept X] using a real-world analogy, then break down the mathematical logic step-by-step, specifically explaining why we transition from an integral to a summation in this context.\"\n2. The \"Black Box\" Method (Active Learning)\nIn Signals and Systems, theory is useless without visual intuition.\nDon't just transcribe: Read a sub-section, then try to draw the block diagram or the impulse response without looking at the book.\nUse NotebookLM for \"Feynman\" checks: Explain a difficult concept to the tool and ask: \"Did I make any conceptual errors in my explanation of convolution? Be critical.\"\n3. Handling Math and Code\nMarkdown is great for text, but for Oppenheim, you need to \"see\" the signal.\nLaTeX for formulas: If you take notes in Markdown, ensure your editor (like Obsidian) supports KaTeX or MathJax.\nSimulation: Don't stop at the paper. Use a small Python script (NumPy/SciPy) to visualize what Oppenheim is describing. Seeing the wave move is worth a thousand notes.\nNotebookLM is a consultation tool, not a replacement for your brain. If you let the AI synthesize the book for you, the knowledge stays in the .md file and not in your head.\nUse it to explain the \"why\" behind the mathematical proofs you don't understand at first glance, but the end-of-chapter problems... those you have to sweat through yourself",

It splits it up into the same sized chunks, right?\n\nI've had apparent success with uploading several dozen 1MB raw text files (server transcripts).

It turns out gemini has a massive context window of 1 million tokens (larger than claude's 200k) - however it is limited in the \"chatbot\" form to where it will skim material you hand it.  If you go into AI studio you essentially have an \"untethered\" version of the model where you can adjust parameters to your liking.\n\nI have just started doing this but set temperature to 0, media resolution to high, thinking level to high, activate code execution, and give a good prompt.\n\nIn addition - there is a limit of 10mb you can hand it of files on the front (dropping to the chat window) so you must deliver these around the \"back\" (google drive) - otherwise it won't work.  This is another thing that makes it superior to claude because claude limits you to 31mb at a time.\n\nI have cancelled my claude sub as of now but the real test for me will be when i have my next open-note exam.  If it isn't able to make as good of a study guide as claude I will just go back to claude.\n\nedit: edited some stuff\n\n  \nedit2: Coming back to this comment...I found you actually need to build a full application to achieve this.  It needs to use API for this to work unfortunately.  But if you use gemini pro that shouldn't be much of a problem.  Claude may be a better option just due to ease of use.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\nI’ve been using NotebookLM for several months as a core tool for my higher education studies (International Trade). Up until about a month ago, it was a game-changer. I rely on two very specific, high-performance prompts that used to give me incredible results, but lately, the output has become—to put it bluntly—useless for serious study.\nThe \"Golden Era\" Performance:\nPrompt 1 (Master Syllabus): From 60-80 page PDFs, it used to generate a 15-20 page comprehensive, dense master guide. Every detail was there.\nPrompt 2 (Quick Review): It would distill those same sources into a perfect 7-8 page \"cheat sheet\" with all the essentials.\nThe Current Problem:\nFor the past month, the results have been extremely poor. I’m getting barely 4 pages of short, fluffy sentences with almost no technical depth. It lacks the density and exhaustiveness required for university-level exams. \nThe Experiment:\nI went back to my old notebooks from late last year—where I still have the high-quality syllabuses previously generated. I re-ran the exact same prompts using the exact same source files.\nThe Result: The difference is night and day, and frankly, abysmal.\nBefore: I used to get 15-20 pages of dense, technical, and exam-ready content.\nNow: The same prompt returns barely 3 pages of superficial summaries, \"fluffy\" language, and short sentences that lack any academic depth.\nI remember a similar \"glitch\" happening back in November or December, but that only lasted a couple of days. This time, it feels like a persistent downgrade in the model's ability to follow complex formatting and density instructions.\nI’m sharing my prompts below so you can see the level of detail I’m asking for. They are designed for high-performance exam prep. Feel free to use them if/when the app starts working correctly again.\n\n\n\\[PROMPT 1: MASTER SYLLABUS\\]\nROLE: Act as a Professor specialized in International Trade and high-performance exam preparation.\nOBJECTIVE: Generate a \"Master Syllabus\" based EXCLUSIVELY on the provided sources, strictly following the outline attached at the end.\nMANDATORY RULES:\nMaximum Information Density: Eliminate rhetorical intros or anecdotes. Every sentence must contain data, concepts, or regulations.\nExhaustiveness: If a section has a list (functions, requirements, etc.), you MUST list and explain EVERY point. No summarizing groups of concepts.\nStructural Fidelity: Follow the exact order of Titles and Subtitles provided.\nStudy Format: Use bold for key terms and bullet points for complex processes.\n\n\n\\[PROMPT 2: QUICK REVIEW GUIDE\\]\nROLE: Act as a pragmatic and synthetic exam tutor.\nOBJECTIVE: Create a \"Quick Review Guide\" (Cheat Sheet) prioritizing extreme synthesis.\nGOLDEN RULES (80/20 MODE):\n80/20 Philosophy: Focus ONLY on key definitions, classifications, and practical tools. Ignore deep theory or fluff.\nOutline Format: No long paragraphs. Use bullets, arrows, and comparative tables.\nKey Vocabulary: Bold the technical terms that are mandatory for memorization.\nTechnical Safety Clause: Maintain exact technical terminology (formulas, specific types of contracts, Incoterms, etc.). Do not use \"etc.\"\n\n\nIs anyone else experiencing this drop in \"intelligence\" or output length? It feels like the context window or the instruction-following capabilities have been heavily throttled.",

To your point about becoming a paid user: I already have a \" pro\" subscription, and unfortunately, that doesn't fix the issue at all. The quality drop is just as bad for paid accounts.\nMy theory is that they are throttling the model’s processing power to allocate resources to all these new features they’re rolling out, like the music generation or the improved mobile slide/infographic functions. Something very similar happened back in November/December—right when they were launching the infographic tools, the output quality tanked for a few days. It seems like every time they prioritize 'visual' updates, the analytical depth of the briefing tool takes a backseat.\"",

If I’m using AI, it’s supposed to make my life easier, not create more manual tasks like copying, pasting, and merging files.\nFor now, I’ve decided to go back to basics. I’m extracting the essential info from the original PDFs myself and dictating it directly into a Word document. It’s a bit old-school, but at least I know the quality is there until the tool is restored to its former glory.",

If the tool can't handle the complexity it was built for, it loses its purpose entirely. For those of us in technical fields, a 'watered-down' AI isn't just a minor inconvenience—it’s a dealbreaker.\nI'm about to cancel my pro subscription.",

I am using the 'Studio' tab, then selecting the 'Information' tool, and finally choosing the 'Create your own' option under reports.\nThis is where I paste my custom prompts to generate full syllabuses. As I mentioned, using the exact same prompts and sources that gave me 20-page reports in December, I am now only getting about 2 or 3 pages of very shallow content. It seems the generation constraints or the output length for custom reports have been significantly reduced lately. Hope this helps your team investigate!",

The content being generated is extremely brief and lacks any technical depth, making it completely useless for anything. This confirms it’s not a prompt-specific issue, but a significant downgrade in how the platform processes and expands on the source material compared to just a month ago",

So I stumbled on a neat trick: I uploaded a JPEG of my business card as a source, and in the slide deck instructions I instructed NLM to create a short deck “using the graphic design of my business, including the font(s) and colors.” It came out great. Since NLM is built atop Gemini, I’m sure there’s even more you can do to manipulate design. ",

I have had a lot of success including the following instructions at the beginning of the slide deck prompt: \"Use the same colors, fonts, and style sheet as https://www.\\[company home page\\].\" The results have been amazing. NBLM generates a slide deck that looks like it was created using the company's own slide deck template. ",
