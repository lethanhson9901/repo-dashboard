      "text": "I could not love an AI tool better than NotebookLM, I use it daily for my scientific research, paper reading, thought gathering, etc.  I also found the way it uses nano banana to generate slides is a transformative idea.  However, I have been getting a hard time to edit the slides it generates, and I tried multiple methods and wasted even more time using those different tools to alter an image.\n\n1, using Gemini or google slides to “prompt” change a page, I can use all of my daily pro/nano banana limit on a single page\n\n2, some online free pdf/ppt conversion tool, it is still image inside of the ppt!\n\n3, Canvas: seems like I have to click on the individual element to change, and needs subscription in the first place?\n\n4, some other tools mentioned online, broke my slides…\n\nI am an engineer, and of course nowadays, a vibe coder (😂），so I asked myself: hmm how hard can it be?  And decided to write my own tool to do so.\n\nIt was a great experience in the process, however I soon know it is not a vibe coding project.  In reality, reverse engineering an image is a VERY challenging task.  With the best vision models and many engineering optimizations and iterations, now this tool is working for me.  Although now I put together as a web app, the model used to achieve there only makes it a barely profitable app unless charge high.  Now I think only if big tech like google can absorb the cost into the api call…\n\nAnyway, just want to share it here and welcome anyone who wants to use it for your work.  If this pain point solving tool can indeed work for more people, it would be fantastic thing for me.\n\n~~Guess I should not promote it with URL so please DM me if you’re interested.~~\n\nUpdate: There are so many people facing the same pain point, so I guess I should not feel shy to share the link here:\n\npxGenius.ai\n\n：）",

      "text": "Hello Reddit,\n\nI am excited to announce a huge update on the NotebookLM MCP.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a96lg1kbvpgg1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0ddbd49448c33051ca733f6e0fef63b7c3f4224\n\n**TL;DR**: MCP and CLI are now one package. You can upload & download files directly (no browser needed). There's a skill installer for AI coding tools. And you can finally switch between Google accounts without losing your mind.\n\n**Why the big refactor?**\n\nI got tired of maintaining two packages. You probably got tired of figuring out which one to install. So I merged everything. One install, you get both tools. Done.\n\n**What's new:**\n\n**🔧 One Package, Both Tools**\n\n    uv tool install notebooklm-mcp-cli\n\nYou get nlm (the CLI) and notebooklm-mcp (the MCP server). The old separate packages are deprecated.\n\n**📤 Direct File Upload:** This one was painful to get working, but now you can upload PDFs, TXT, Markdown, and audio files directly through HTTP. No browser automation. For example:\n\n`nlm source add file /path/to/doc.pdf --wait`\n\n**🤖 Skill Installer:** If you're using Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor, or any other AI coding tool, you can install NotebookLM as a skill:\n\n`nlm skill install claude-code`\n\nIt drops the skill file where your tool expects it. You can also run nlm skill list to see what's installed. There are flags for user or project-level install.\n\n**🔐 Multi-Profile Auth:** Each profile gets its own Chrome session. So you can have your work account and personal account without logging out and back in constantly.\n\n`nlm login profile switch work`\n\n`nlm login profile list`\n\nYou can even set a default: \n\n    nlm config set auth.default_profile work\n\n**📥 Downloads That Actually Work:** You can download any artifact type now. Audio, video, reports, slides, infographics, mind maps, data tables. Quiz and flashcards come out as JSON, Markdown, or HTML.\n\n**📝 Notes:** Full CRUD. nlm note create, list, update, delete. MCP tools too.\n\n📤 **Export to Google Workspace:** Data Tables go to Sheets. Reports go to Docs. For example:\n\n    nlm export to-sheets <notebook> --artifact-id <id>\n\nAlso in this release:\n\n✅ Sharing API (public links, invite collaborators)\n\n✅ Dual CLI syntax (i.e, Verb-first and noun-first, for example: nlm notebook list OR nlm list notebooks)\n\n✅ Aliases (use names instead of UUIDs)\n\n✅ Interactive chat mode\n\n✅ HTTP transport for MCP (community PR)\n\n✅ Auto re-auth (survives token expiration)\n\n✅ MCP consolidated to 28 tools DESPITE adding more functionality\n\nThe workflow I'm using daily:\n\nCreate a notebook, upload some PDFs, run deep research, import the sources, generate a podcast and briefing doc, export the briefing to Docs, share it publicly. All from the terminal. No touching the UI.\n\nI'm honestly using the CLI more than the MCP at this point (through AI of course); maybe this will change when more tools have the MCP lazy load. It's just feels faster than the MCP when the AI uses it.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp-cli](https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp-cli)\n\n**Demo**: Check the README for video walkthroughs (or click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQBQigFK-E8))\n\nGo crazy. Level up your second brain game.\n\nHappy to answer questions or hear about bugs. \n\nStill a passion vibe-coding project, still maintaining it as Google changes things under the hood. At least now it will be easier to add and maintain as a unified MCP/CLI project.\n\n",

The generated content itself is actually pretty solid and saves me a lot of prep time.\n\nWhere I usually get stuck is after export. I almost always need to make small edits (wording, layout, rearranging a slide or two) before sharing it with clients.\n\nI ended up Googling to make the exported PPT easier to edit and tried a PDF/PPT conversion tool(PDNob). For my use case, it helped turn the slides into fully editable content pretty quickly.\n\nWhat I liked:\n\nText stays clean and readable after conversion\n\nSlide structure doesn’t get messed up\n\nEasy to jump in and make quick edits\n\nWhat could be better:\n\nNo batch conversion (had to do files one at a time)\n\nImages sometimes need minor manual adjustment\n\nAnyway, it’s been useful when I need to polish NotebookLM-generated slides right before a meeting quickly.\n\nCurious how you guys handle multiple conversions? Or use other tools/workflows?\n\nMany thanks for any suggestions🙏",

If I need speed + editability, I export from NotebookLM → Google Slides, then do final polish there (layout tweaks, phrasing, hierarchy). It preserves structure better and avoids text being “flattened”.\n\nFor multiple conversions:\n\t•\tGoogle Slides API + Drive batch import (even semi-manual) scales better than PDF tools.\n\t•\tIf PPT is mandatory, I batch-clean using Slide Master + Find/Replace rules instead of per-slide edits.\n\t•\tFor visuals, I assume light manual adjustment is unavoidable with AI-generated slides—no tool fully solves that yet.\n\nRule of thumb:\nPDF tools are fine for last-minute fixes, but for repeatable workflows, staying native (Slides → Slides / PPT → PPT) saves more time long term.\n\nCurious if Google will expose more granular export controls in NotebookLM—would remove 80% of this friction.",

To work around this, I started splitting prompts into multiple parts and then merging the outputs in Sheets. This significantly improves coverage and completeness, since it forces the model to process most of the document.\n\nIt’s still not perfect, and it doesn’t always go through the entire file. I suspect this is related to context window limits. That said, I’m genuinely impressed by how well it follows structured prompts, and the results are often phenomenal given the constraints.\n\n🤔 Curious to hear your thoughts, comments, or experiences with similar large-document extraction tasks. I’m always looking for better ways to work with big files more reliably.",

You can then turn that output into multiple smaller prompts, and ideally not run everything across all 100 interviews 😄, because that’s probably too much for NotebookLM.  \n  \nI think splitting is the way to go, and then merging the results later. You can use some programmable logic to find uniqueness, de-duplicate entries, and identify the best matches. Even ChatGPT can help at that stage if you’re working in Sheets or a similar setup.  \n  \nIt’s still a bit frustrating and requires some manual work, but honestly, compared to doing everything manually, it’s a HUGE help 🙂.

As a consequence, X will become more and more a source of high-quality content that will be worth saving for our research.\n\n**What's new:**\n\n* **Tweets & Threads**: Save any tweet, or capture an entire thread as a single source. The extension automatically detects when a tweet is part of a thread and grabs all connected posts — no manual stitching required.\n* **Articles**: Save articles shared on X directly to your notebooks.\n* **Two ways to save**: Use the Web Clipper buttons that appear on X, or save from the side panel with one click.\n\nIf you're following expert takes, industry discussions, or breaking news on X, you can now pull that content straight into NotebookLM.\n\nCurious if anyone here uses X (Twitter) as a research source? If so, do you save single tweets, threads or articles?\n\nAny feedback appreciate 🙏",

      "text": "The slide deck feature is so freaking perfect until those random hallucinations in one or two slides show up. So like most people here, I also looked at what solutions others have done.\n\nI see people made tools that reconstruct the PDFs into editable PPTs, but every time I tried those, they didn’t really preserve the original font or design. Things were always slightly off, which was annoying since the rest of the deck actually looked great. Like I just want to fix this one or two slides and it's ready.\n\nSo I thought, why not just fix the broken slide with AI? I tried screenshotting the problematic slide and having Gemini Pro edit it, and it worked well. It preserved the original design, fonts, spacing, everything.\n\nThe downside was how tiring and cumbersome it was. Editing the PDF, recompiling everything, replacing the slide, converting to PPT, doing AI edits one at a time (AI edits are slow asf), and then last thing i know I hitmy rate limit. I just want to fix a small mistake. I just want something quick and does the job.\n\nSo I ended up hacking together my own thing. For my use-case, I didn't need full editability. Just being able to patch hallucinations quickly while preserving the original design mattered way more to me.\n\nOne unexpected bonus was I was able to generate NEW slides that still matched the original look, which ended up being super useful for me, then to be able to easily export it as PPTX.\n\nGuess I can't link it here directly but if this is a pain point for you too, please let me know so I can send you a DM!",

Important disclaimer, though - I am not very tech-savvy, I discussed the problem with Claude and Claude suggested solutions and then implemented them.\n\nClaude can easily convert the pdfs to an actual powerpoint presentation, but each slide becomes an image. So reordering and deleting is easy, editing is not possible. A workaround - Claude then extracted the text from slides and created a text-only ppt, fully editable. If I wanted to edit something (not much, just some wording), I could copy parts of the text and paste over the \"image slides\", covering the original text. Yes, it's clunky. But I hope at least the first part will be useful for you.",

Since NotebookLM works best with high-quality source material, it actually works really well with reading highlights.\n\nThe rough flow is:\n\n1. Import highlights from Kindle Cloud Reader into Glasp\n2. Copy them OR download them as Markdown\n3. Paste or upload into NotebookLM as a source\n\nI’ve been testing it for research + studying, and it’s nice being able to ask questions across multiple books.\n\nIf anyone is interested, I wrote a step-by-step tutorial here:  \n[How to Import Kindle Highlights into NotebookLM with Glasp](https://glasp.co/posts/how-to-import-kindle-highlights-into-notebooklm-with-glasp)",

      "text": "Hi everyone! I am a 2nd semester nursing student at my local college (ADN). I am trying to get a prompt that helps cover as much as it can with Notebook. My problem is, I feel that every response from Notebook is lacking in some way or another. I understand its AI-generated but I feel that my prompts are in-depth enough. I just want it to go over everything I would need to know for school, tests and clinicals. Another problem is that if I told it to go off of the syllabus alone it would give straight up 4 sentences. I have seen some prompts and another student even gave me her prompt but when I entered it, it was still lacking a lot of what felt like important information. I am talking about things like pregnancy categories, laws, controlled substances levels. Can anyone help me figure out the best way to get something better. I know I should be reading the book or \"skimming\" but I don't know what to \"skim\" and what not to. If I go off the syllabus of my main class I need to read 25 chapters and  each is at minimum 30-ish pages. I simply do not have that kind of time. Please help. \n\n\\*\\*I only have the free version. Would I get a better/more fulfilling response if I had a paid one?",
