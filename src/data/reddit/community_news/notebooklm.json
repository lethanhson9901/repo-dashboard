If I may add one (as the dev behind it) [Web Clipper for NotebookLM](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-clipper-for-notebookl/ancgeemmgnlempppapnfkdpghghphgjb) is worth checking out too, especially if you use YouTube with NotebookLM.\n\nIt goes well beyond single video support. You can add:\n\n* Individual YouTube videos\n* Entire YouTube channels\n* YouTube playlists\n* YouTube Shorts\n* YouTube Livestreams\n\nIt also has **duplicate detection** so you never accidentally add the same video twice to a notebook (super useful for bulk operations). Speaking of bulk: if you're adding more videos than a notebook's source limit allows, you can pick which ones get added. You can also create and manage notebooks directly from the extension.\n\nAnd YouTube is just one part of it. Web Clipper also supports:\n\n* **Google Drive source auto-sync** keeps your notebook sources in sync with your Drive files\n* **Export NotebookLM artifacts** in tons of formats: Word, Excel, CSV, Anki flashcards, Zip, multiple mind map formats, and more\n* **Adding tweets, threads, and X (Twitter) articles** as sources\n\n…and more on the way.\n\n[Free on the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-clipper-for-notebookl/ancgeemmgnlempppapnfkdpghghphgjb) if anyone wants to give it a try! 🙂",

Sadly it does seem like Gemini doesn't like having too many notebooks with a ton of sources, but I am not sure what the limits are. Gemini will say that there are too many resources for its context window and that it may have missed things.\n\nHere is where I am confused. My Google One sub lets me have notebooks of up to 300 sources. The ultra subscription lets you have 1000, which means theoretically this is achievable by the hardware. Can I bypass this limitation using multiple Notebooks and chatting in Gemini?",

But if you're trying to do long-form creative writing with a bevy of resource/context files for world-building and story accuracy, I find using the NotebookLM interface to be far better at holding accuracy than trying to link Notebooks to the Gemini interface. \n\nI don't really trust the regular Gemini window to capture context from multiple notebooks at once after experimenting with it. And using the same story prompts in both Gemini and NotebookLM, I found much better story accuracy and output in the NotebookLM window. \n\nThe lack of ability to edit prompts can be worked around by using a notepad file called prompt.txt or something similar, then you just prompt the main NotebookLM window to \"output based on the file 'prompt.txt' blah blah blah\" and then NotebookLM will read your prompt.txt file and output based off of it. Which gets around the character limit restrictions of the main notebookLM window **and** allows you to edit your prompt.txt file for re-outputs if you make a mistake in your prompt that you didn't catch. \n\nFor me, the main Gemini interface just doesn't handle context files well compared to using NotebookLM directly. But again, that's for very, very long form fiction rather than simply chatting with a chatbot personality so YMMV.",

If I tell it to do that in the window itself, it will quickly forget and revert to merely regurgitating my detailed prompts back to me.\n\nWhat I do to get around that is create a general directives.txt file. it seems to remember directives extremely well that way, and I have a header for my prompt.txt file that re-iterates the instruction to flourish dialogue and scenes with accents from my Characters.txt file and atmospherics from both my Locations.txt and Objects.txt reference files. That seems to do the trick and is a low-impact way to keep the output on track with accuracy and flair.\n\nIt seems to have a very good memory for source files but an awful atrocious memory for window inputs. This can be useful when you want to edit an output manually, which I do somewhat often, as you can then put it into a file such as '7. Day seven of story.txt' file which will imprint on the LLM over the top of the window output. So in a way, it's a good thing if you manage the tool correctly as you can overwrite it's outputs efficiently with proper uploading of the story back into it, meaning your edited version of it's output can overwrite it's own output for when you want to make corrections to any element of the output.",

It's for when I want to study a subject or interact with the literature without having to read every single word straight up. I can share a thought and have NotebookLM counter-argue and teach me based *exclusively* on those sources.\n\nWhat makes NotebookLM vital for me is the custom instructions. I tell it that its job is to teach me, point out my mistakes, and use only the sources to correct me, showing me why I'm confused and where my misconceptions might be coming from.\n\nThey are completely different tools/workflows.\n\nI’ve tried using Gems and attaching notebooks to specific convos, but I feel like Gems just add a layer of complexity that makes things worse. It doesn't amplify the benefits enough to be worth it. Also, I don't like the way Gems talk, it feels super condescending. Even if you change the persona, it still feels kinda goofy",

Actually, just the main things would take more (I've already written and published a paper based on those same sources, I need it to elaborate on a different focus). I don't think the report can fit in less than 10-15 A4 sheets. \n\nHowever, I can't get NotebookLM to output a report on that length. Initially, it just writes a synthesis that obviously, in 1500-2000 words leaves several important things out, which are developed on the sources. I asked it to make it more exhaustive, however it keeps the reports on the same length. \n\nIs there a way to overcome this, which looks like an (undocumented at least for me) limitation?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

          "text": "This isn’t even a question. For studying, research and learning notebooklm is miles better. \n\nGems is great for redundant and repetitive tasks imo. The amount of sources you can add are limited and it’s not as intuitive for studying. \n\nI use Gems for citation engines, let’s call it that. So I upload citation and reference guides in PDF format for each reference style and I use that Gem to doublecheck a footnote, bibliographic entry or attach the pdf of a journal article and ask it to cite it for me…\n\nNotebooklm is better for studying for several reasons:\n\n1) For one you can add more sources. 50 in free version, 300 in Pro and 600 in Ultra, and each one of them can be up to 500,000 words and 200MB. And it accepts virtually all file formats, MP3, doc, docx, pdf, pptx, txt, rtf, JPG, JPEG and video. And the difference is you can select specific sources for each task or question…but you canto do that in each new query in Gemini Gems\n\n2) You can create mind maps, slide decks, video overviews, audio overviews etc…And export them as well. Also whatever it generates for you can be added as a source within the notebook and it creates a cycle of information and knowledge. \n\nFor example for each course I have I upload the syllabus as a docx or pdf file and right away create a mindmap and it creates a visualization of the entire course. Or for midterms and final exams I select the relevant lectures, readings and notes I uploaded and it automatically creates a mindmap based on the weeks or topics. \n\n3) The audio overview feature is second to none tbh. I create one for each lecture I have to review and I literally just listen to those to prepare for tests and exams. I select the lecture slides, my pdf or docx notes from the lecture, and a transcription of the lecture(I record my university lectures) and I give it a custom prompt and set Theron of the audio overview to long and on deep dive mode. \n\nIt’s so accurate that it even picks up on small jokes and nuances my professor made during the lecture. And I can download them and listen offline…\n\n\nOh and btw notebooklm can transcribe uploaded recordings when you upsold them as a source. But I use nota AI since it’s even more accurate(highly recommend it tbh) it’s feature packed and suppers virtually all formats for exporting and has a lot of connectors and integrations. \n\n\n4) Notebooklm now has chat history and it’s honestly great to see what I was evening before. And the best part is you can now use Notebooklm notebooks as sources in Gemini chats and in Gemini Gems. \n\n\nBesides creating one for each course I create one for each large research paper or essay I am writing and I upload the instructions and info as a PDF and all my scholars journal articles. It’s a great way to find relevant quotes, pages, information etc…\n\nOr when I have dozens of or hundreds of sources it’s a great way to filter them out and see which ones are best for my sub arguments. \n\n\nSo overall Gems are great for redundant and repetitive tasks like: \n\n- Citations and references \n- Editing text \n- Creating Prompts\n\n\nNotebooklm Is great for:\n\n- Studying and learning \n- Research \n- Outlines \n- Notes",

              "text": "I'm sorry, but I find Perplexity Spaces lacking. As someone who has been a subscriber to ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity, and Claude for the past two years, I believe that NotebookLM the best option for projects similar to a ChatGPT project or Perplexity Spaces. The reason is its excellent integration with Google Workspace, seamless exporting, and the large context window it offers.\n\nAlthough they use Gemini 3 Flash, which lacks the reasoning of Gemini 3 Pro, the ability to upload so many sources and support various file formats, along with features like slide decks, overviews, mind maps, briefs, and reports, makes it superior. I would rank these tools based on their features as follows:\n\n1. NotebookLM\n2. ChatGPT Projects\n3. Perplexity Spaces\n\nHere's an important point: you may think you have access to those models in Perplexity Spaces, but there’s a misunderstanding. In Perplexity, even though you have access to these models, they are fine-tuned and optimized versions that are system-prompted for search and deep research. Thus, when using Gemini 3 Pro or Sonnet 4.5 or GPT 5.2 in Perplexity, it's not the same as accessing them in ChatGPT Cloud or in their native versions. This is primarily because all models in Perplexity are limited to a context window of 32k, which is significantly lower than what is becoming standard. In 2026, a 32k context will feel equivalent to an 8k context window.\n\nWhile Perplexity is excellent for web searches, fact-checking, and small tasks, it falls short for extensive research or work due to its limited context window. Furthermore, the claims about the models available in Perplexity can be misleading. You don't have full access to those models’ capabilities. You can test this by using the same prompt on both Gemini 3 Pro and Perplexity or comparing GPT 5.2 in Perplexity to GPT 5.2 in ChatGPT. The results will highlight significant differences, as the outputs from the native chatbots tend to be more thorough, better reasoned, and more logical.\n\nUntil Perplexity increases its context window, improves its long memory, and resolves the issue where the chat or query changes the model after a few exchanges, it is not fair to compare Perplexity Spaces to Notebook LM. While Notebook LM is better suited for more demanding tasks, Perplexity Spaces is more appropriate for smaller, simpler tasks.",

As for the other NBLM’s features (flashcards, quizzes, podcasts etc.) I honestly do not quite care as much as they don’t really fit into my learning process. I just want to query my study material.\n\n As for the context window, I think they have a good enough RAG implementation that injects into the context window only the very relevant bits, as I’ve never had any problem even with many files uploaded. (I’ve tried with as many as 50 PDFs in a single Space — I don’t even know if there’s a limit.)\n\nAnyway, as I think Perplexity will inevitably mess up again and further limit Pro usage, I’m starting dabbling into self hosted Open WebUI with OpenRouter models to try replicating the Perplexity experience. However I find it very lacking in the quality of the responses. If you have any recommendation to make it better (settings, prompt templates, embedding models etc.) I would be very interested to hear it.",

I have a prompt that says something like \"Create a presentation following this artistic style [insert here art style chosen] and addressing ALL the following subjects according to the source [insert here list of subjects].\"\n\nThen I remind it to include down in the right corner a miniature of a book with the title of the book and on top-left the subject addressed in that slide (for having more context while I study them).\n\nI also have the same Gem trained to, once the presentation is finished, check if all the subjects it listed are included in it (I upload the PDF) and give back a % of coverage. It's usually 95% or so. \n\nThis method works great, although I do it like a hobby, I don't know if this would be perfect for complex exams.\n\nEdit, forgot this: how many bookmarks to include into the Gem at the beginning depends on you. I usually try to choose accordingly so the presentation has coherence, this is something you try and learn, but it's also a matter of choice (usually each presentation has 15 slides) so that should be taken into account.\n\nAlso sorry for my English.",

Personally I find it really weak in terms of uncovering novel new stuff or enabling deeper knowledge on something you're an highly experienced in, but that wasn't the goal and can also reflect how narrow or wide the spectrum is.\n\n - Book or podcast companion: for longform podcasts or YT videos it's FANTASTIC at being a read-along chat. I'm using it for books more as well.\n\n\nIn the professional domain where I'm knowledgeable: I amusingly have found a lot of value in using the interactive podcast mode to \"chat with my ideas,\" and have it discuss or articulate back in a non-jargony way. It's really nice when it's a narrow technical topic that can you rarely get to verbally explore the topic versus just text/technical/doing.\n\nIn the \"new topic discovery\" way, combined with deep research and high-effort source curation for things like research papers or long-form interviews it makes otherwise inaccessible source material A LOT more interesting and engaging.\n\n\nWhat it doesn't compete with: my primary knowledge base/notes system (I really wish it had bidirectionality with markdown notes). It's inferior to an IDE workflow (that's okay!), or early/adhoc exploration for a topic directly in a web-chat. \n\nI treat it more as a companion when I want to \"doubleclick\" on something narrow versus broad... and treat notebooks more ephemeral than I would with my KB.",

While I’m excited to use the tool, I’m struggling to find its true value and I feel like I’m not yet utilizing its full potential.\n\nCurrently, I find myself digesting so much data that it becomes overwhelming, causing the \"big picture\" to get lost. As someone focused on personal growth and learning rather than social media content creation, I would love your insights on a few points:\n\na) Can you recommend high-quality sources or tutorials specifically for using NotebookLM as a learning tool? There is so much information out there that I’m struggling to distinguish the high-quality guides from the noise.\n\nb) Do you find that features like the \"Studio\" outputs (FAQs, Briefing Docs, mind maps etc.)  Am I missing out on key insights by not using all the available formats?\n\nc) What is your workflow for choosing sources? Do you upload everything and filter later, or do you strictly curate high-quality data before importing it into a notebook?\n\nThank you so much in advance for your help!",

I teach a course on \"Design and Product Development\" at Northeastern University, and I have mandated the students to use NotebookLM as the knowledge repository for their semester project. I started them off by just having them upload chapters from the textbook as well as the case studies.\n\nAfter they did that, I had them focus on the chat, and told them to copy all the follow-up questions suggested and post them as prompts. NotebookLM responded with answers to each with follow-up questions. I had them click each responce to save as note, and then repeat the copy and paste for all subsequent suggested questions. By the end, they had a robust repository of related knowledge saved as notes. I had them next save the notes as sources. Then, I had them generate a mind map, and explore the topics. I had them click on a few end points to generate detailed replies...save as note...convert to source. I then had them generate a generic Infographic to illustrate what happens when you overload the tool with too many sources. Then, I had them generate another infographic after deselecting all the sources EXCEPT ones relevant to a particular case study, and use the edit pencil in the tool to prompt exactly what they want the infographic to show. I had them do the same for the slide show, the video, the audio, etc. In the podcast, I have them use the call-in function to ask specific questions. I also have them generate quizes and flash cards to help them master a topic.\n\nFinally, I created a notebook with 300 sources and various tool outputs that show the capability.",

At some point it starts to feel like I'm going in circles just rearranging the same info and not making progress.\n\nI don’t think you’re missing any secret sauce by not using all the outputs. If anything, using all of them can make the big picture blurrier. I’ve found it works better when I pick one format that sort of becomes the anchor and then I just keep asking better questions against it. The moment I start bouncing between formats, I lose the thread and end up with a lot of “nice summaries\" but not much else.\n\nThe other thing is…it kinda assumes you already know what you’re looking for. If your question is sharp, it feels magical. If your question is still forming...not so much. That’s probably why so many “how to use it” resources feel unsatisfying, because they don’t talk about how to really use it for learning, just how to click buttons and get different outputs.\n\nAlso feels like source structure matters way more than people admit. If everything goes into one bucket, the outputs start to feel samey and mushy, no matter how clean the formatting is.",

And when I reflect when I did best and thoroughly enjoyed learning, it was always a \"slog\" but to be honest AI can help us be more productive but we lose all the learning in-between. \n\nLearning while AI does the work, at least to me, is a management/coordination skill and less of technical problem solving. \n\nIf your goal is to ultimately get accustomed to material, it doesn't matter if the AI can write you an essay, you still need to sit, read, and parse it. And at that point, I actually prefer parsing the source material most of the time but I enjoy how certain people write over the AI especially since the AI requires so much hand holding to really get into the nuance (and because you aren't a subject experts, who really knows what is right) while subject experts guide you towards the nuance.  \n\nAI has its places like general planning and overview, but I use it more to help me find resources as a learner. (And the latest Gemini has really sucked tbh.)",

Choose your own sources, books, YT. The quality of your sources determines the quality of the learning. I wouldn’t trust the sources NBLM provides. If I have to check its quality I might as well find my own. \n\nThis is what I do.\n\nLet’s say you want to learn a totally new subject. This subject has say 3 experts. Each expert has written books and did some interviews and lectures on YT. I’d create one notebook for each expert and prompt the chat to pretend it’s the expert. Then have a conversation with the experts. You can stop here. Or create a new notebook and put all three experts’ sources in there. Then for the chat, you can prompt it to be a professor and your sources are its teaching material. Or to be creative, you can prompt it to be a debate moderator and have the three experts debate amongst themselves.\n\nNBLM is simply an LLM for (your) source materials. Nothing more. Use it for its strengths.",

If your goal is to hit gym consistently, ask your gem to make an workout plan and add the task to gtasks and remind you everyday. If you feel like not going to gym, let your gem know that, it will give you an minimal routine so you don't skit workout completely. If your goal is to study, create an tutor gem and upload the book pdf, ask it to summarise and explain the material and also to give an enectode to remember stuff easily, the guided learning tool is extremely useful for learning. Use notebookLM to search pdf for a specific information. In my opinion notebookLM is good for reviewing the material not studying.",

      "text": "The slide deck feature is so freaking perfect until those random hallucinations in one or two slides show up. So like most people here, I also looked at what solutions others have done.\n\nI see people made tools that reconstruct the PDFs into editable PPTs, but every time I tried those, they didn’t really preserve the original font or design. Things were always slightly off, which was annoying since the rest of the deck actually looked great. Like I just want to fix this one or two slides and it's ready.\n\nSo I thought, why not just fix the broken slide with AI? I tried screenshotting the problematic slide and having Gemini Pro edit it, and it worked well. It preserved the original design, fonts, spacing, everything.\n\nThe downside was how tiring and cumbersome it was. Editing the PDF, recompiling everything, replacing the slide, converting to PPT, doing AI edits one at a time (AI edits are slow asf), and then last thing i know I hitmy rate limit. I just want to fix a small mistake. I just want something quick and does the job.\n\nSo I ended up hacking together my own thing. For my use-case, I didn't need full editability. Just being able to patch hallucinations quickly while preserving the original design mattered way more to me.\n\nOne unexpected bonus was I was able to generate NEW slides that still matched the original look, which ended up being super useful for me, then to be able to easily export it as PPTX.\n\nGuess I can't link it here directly but if this is a pain point for you too, please let me know so I can send you a DM!",

I want to be able to organize Notebooks into editable folders for classes, various hobbies, etc. \n\nHeck, maybe even a feature to \"favorite/star/pin\" certain Notebooks so they always appear at the top.\n\nThanks 👍🏻",

      "text": "It’s clear that editing LM Slides is a pain - there are solutions, but none as simple as we would like.\n\nI use LM slides to help give me a creative burst when I’m getting to deep in weeds on details, and with the right “pencil prompt” it usually does a great job. \n\n**EDIT Workaround**: \n\nIn my case “Bad or Incorrect” text is usually the design flaw.  So, you copy the slide, post in GPT or Gemini, prompt it “remove all text and polish for clarity”, then paste the refined graphic into PowerPoint,  and add the perfect text.\n\nYeah, still work, but no special skills required.\n\nHope it helps - share your best LM workarounds below.  🏆🥃",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m currently working on my master’s thesis on knowledge and information sharing within organizations (learning practices, internal communication, knowledge flows inside companies). I’m about to start the literature review / state of the art and I’m looking for a step-by-step AI-assisted workflow to support this phase.\n\nWhat I’m specifically looking for is help using AI to find solid academic sources, identify key authors and concepts, and then produce a structured synthesis of the literature (definitions, main arguments, convergences/divergences), with real, verifiable citations. The goal is not to copy-paste AI-generated paragraphs, but to end up with a reliable account that helps me write my own paragraphs in my own words.\n\nI currently have access to Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity, and I’m curious how people combine tools like these in practice. How do you use AI to support source discovery, information extraction, and citation management without hallucinated references?\n\nIf you have concrete workflows, tools you trust, or pitfalls to avoid (especially around citations and verification), I’d really appreciate your feedback. Thanks!",

The find sources function isn't half bad and can find quite a few scholarly things - definitely won't find you everything relevant and additional Actual research will still be required to make sure you have a good, representative sample of sources. Usually I do this by looking at what is cited by the scholarly sources it pulls and looking at the related articles on whatever platform owns the journal (ebsco, proquest, etc), going on a wiki walk just collecting as much info as I can, adding to NotebookLM as I go. Then winnow down to what's most relevant. \n\nYou can use the whole-notebook summary from the landing/chat page as a prompt for the find sources function to expand further. I have a free year of the pro plan with my student email, so I tend to go a bit overboard on collecting sources. Then you can use the various studio functions to start pulling out trends and arguments via reports (my personal favorite), mind maps, slides, audio overview....this tool has made research, which I've always enjoyed doing even on my own time, so much more straightforward and getting to both conclusions, and deeper questions, so much faster. I genuinely don't even feel the need to pull in any other tools 98% of the time.\n\nGood luck with your thesis! Sounds like a really interesting topic - I just finished my MLIS. Let me know if you want some help tracking down full published books on your topic, sounds like it could be a fun opportunity to practice my professional skills 😉",

You can create a set with based on the vocabulary list, or based on the text itself (reading comprehension). \n\nA quiz.\n\nThe audio brief. Here it's important to make sure NLM understand this is for teaching purpose, and the level you are learning, so that the brief is limited in vocabulary and grammar patterns appropriate for the level. What I could not manage to do was to have the narrators use a fully enunciated pronunciation, to make it easier to understand. But I tell students to lower the playback speed to 0.75 and that helps.\n\nFor the following excerpts I add two sources: the new excerpt and the list of words from the previous excerpts, so that NLM creates its materials focusing on new vocabulary only.\n\nI use excerpts from The Wizard of Oz, which is a classic book with a relatively easy vocabulary.

I usually copy/paste into a note so I can edit later, since pinned notes are editable.\n\nThen, you convert a note (or all notes, not exclusive) into a source and only then does it consider it when responding. It doesn’t read from notes, just from sources and chat responses.\n\nI also get multiple answers, different approaches or formulas, save the ones I want into a note, then convert to source, and clear chat so the options I didn’t use don’t cause confusion.",

NotebookLM is just designed as a chatbot that has access to your files that you add, but not designed as a \"workspace\" in the sense that you can use AI's output to write back to your files, and then improve the entire workspace's knowledge as a whole over time.\n\nIf you want more note-writing functionality, you'll need Notion, Obsidian or Atlas Workspace. Obsidian doesn't come with AI though, and Notion's UI feels clunky and janky these days. Atlas Workspace is also built for answers grounded in citations like NotebookLM, and can even use AI to do high-level re-organizing of your notes (grouping notes, making connections, etc). Probably the best for research projects at the moment.",

      "text": "I’ve been using NotebookLM extensively for creating comprehensive learning materials, specifically trying to simulate \"Graduate Level Seminars\" where the hosts analyze sources line-by-line rather than just summarizing them.\n\nThe Use Case:\n\nI use custom instructions to tell the AI to parse the source material in extreme detail (parsing every line, discussing historical/psychological context, recapping every 7 minutes, and aiming for a \"lossless\" transfer of information). My goal is to use this for language learning and deep academic study, where a 10-minute summary isn't enough—I need the full 30-60+ minute breakdown.\n\nThe Issue:\n\nPreviously, I could manage to get 25-35 minute Video Overviews by using very specific prompts asking for extended length and detailed breakdowns. However, recently, no matter how much I emphasize \"Do not summarize\" or \"Parse every line\" in the prompt, the output seems to hit a hard cap.\n\nShort outputs: It wraps up in 6-9 minutes, glossing over the details.\n\nGeneration Failed: If I push the prompt too hard (asking for 90 mins, detailed mic-recaps), it processes for a while and then returns a \"Network Error\" or \"Generation Failed.\"\n\nThe Request to the Team:\n\nIs there a strict output token limit that has been tightened recently?\n\nFor users who need comprehensive education rather than quick summaries, could we get a \"Deep Dive\" or \"Extended Duration\" toggle?\n\nWe are willing to wait longer for the generation if it means the hosts won't rush through the content. A \"Lecture Mode\" that allows for 45+ minutes of audio generation would be a game-changer for using NotebookLM as a serious study companion.\n\nMy current prompt strategy (abbreviated):\n\n\"Parse Each Line. Recap Every 7 mins. Two experts recording a graduate seminar. Explain every keyword in multiple languages. Focus on depth over brevity. Ignore length limits...\"\n\nHas anyone else found a workaround to force the hosts to slow down and cover the entirety of a long source without summarizing?\n\nThanks!",
