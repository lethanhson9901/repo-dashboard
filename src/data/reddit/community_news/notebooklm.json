Upload your audio file by clicking the \"Add\" button in the Sources panel (left column) - supported formats include MP3, M4A, and WAV\n1. Wait for processing - you'll see a spinning wheel, then a gray checkbox when ready\n1. Prompt for transcription - In the chat box at the bottom, use this specific prompt: \"Generate a verbatim transcript. Keep all words. Do not delete words. Do not change words. Insert proper punctuation.\"\n1. Save the transcript - Click \"Save Note\" to preserve it in the Studio panel for future access\n \nThe transcript will appear in the center chat panel after a few seconds of processing. You can then copy and paste it into other applications as needed.\n​\nTranscribing Audio Overviews\n\nIf you want to transcribe a NotebookLM-generated Audio Overview (the AI podcast feature), download the audio file using the three-dot menu, then re-upload it as a source and follow the same steps above.\n​",

Let NotebookLM index them so it \"knows\" your project.\n * Connect to Gemini:\n   * Open Gemini.\n   * In the chat box, click the plus (+) icon (the attachment menu).\n   * Select NotebookLM from the options (alongside Drive, Photos, etc.).\n * Select Your Notebook:\n   * A list of your notebooks will appear. Select the one(s) relevant to your current task.\n   * Tip: You can attach multiple notebooks to a single Gemini thread to synthesize information across different projects.\n * Prompt Gemini with Grounding:\n   * Ask questions like: \"Based on my 'Project X' notebook, draft a project proposal that also incorporates current 2026 market trends from the web.\"\n   * Gemini will now use your private data as the primary source of truth while filling in gaps with its general knowledge.\n\n\n💡 Use Case Example: Research to Interactive Dashboard\nImagine you are a researcher or a business lead tracking a new industry trend.\n * The Problem: You have 50+ PDFs and 10 recorded meetings in NotebookLM, but it's hard to visualize the \"big picture\" or share it with a team in a fun way.\n * The Integrated Solution:\n   * Attach your research notebook to a Gemini thread.\n   * Prompt: \"Analyze the competitive landscape from my notes and create an interactive strategy board. Use your 'Canvas' feature to make it a dynamic dashboard with filters for 'Cost' and 'Risk'.\"\n   * The Result: Gemini uses its coding capabilities to build a live, functional dashboard in the chat, but every data point is pulled directly from your verified sources in NotebookLM.\n\n🚀 Why This Matters\n| Feature | Standalone NotebookLM | Gemini + NotebookLM Integration |\n|---|---|---|\n| Data Scope | Only the sources you upload. | Your sources + real-time web browsing. |\n| Output Style | Text-based notes/summaries. | Interactive apps, charts, and complex code. |\n| History | Chat history is notebook-specific. | Persistent chat history in the main Gemini app. |\n| Context | Single notebook focus. | Can \"bridge\" multiple notebooks together. |",

I hate that it's Google 😂 but it's working together so well I'm willing to endure Google's stubborn refusal to fix their horribly bad mobile apps. \n\nI use it like this a lot, but tbh still haven't really developed a feeling for how broad or narrow to keep my Notebooks. Learning on the go. \n\nAnd obviously source organization is shit, but there are millions of chrome extensions for it. One open source I've read about earlier would be foldLM, but I haven't had a chance to try it yet.\n\n\n/ETA also don't fall in love, I fully expect Google to discontinue NotebookLM for no reason whatsoever as soon as it's feature complete. 🙄",

Not sure it works for you, but one option could be to record Life knowledge in a generic place (google docs, drive, audio notes) and bring them to all the required projects within NotebookLM. In this way you are not tied to a tool, and if there a tool better than NotebookLM in future, you still migrate to that easily.",

Previously, NotebookLM could only read text (like PDFs or Google Docs). Now, you can upload audio recordings directly into the platform.\n\nOnce uploaded, NotebookLM automatically generates a written transcript of the recording. This transforms your audio from a \"locked\" sound file into searchable, analyzable text. You can then interact with this audio just like any other document—asking the AI to summarize it, find specific quotes, or combine its insights with your other notes.\n\n**Key Benefits:**\n\n* **Searchability:** Instantly find what was said in a clear text format without re-listening to hours of audio.\n* **Deep Analysis:** Use the AI to extract themes, action items, or specific details that might be easy to miss.\n* **Time Savings:** Eliminate the tedious manual work of typing out meeting notes or interview transcripts.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m3p5y6rih2fg1.png?width=854&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad64de558f6cbfab2d852bf91f8c21fad61ef93d\n\n",

I work full time so i have to optimize my time, even though I have already studied various topics during university.

A simple \"summarize it\" is enough?\n-is it better to give notebook lm the entire book or upload chapter by chapter?",

You can easily get a text summary in the main chat section but the studio features for making info grafix and slide shows and such as amazing. \n\nHere is the post that first got me going w/ the idea that you can even add anything to an infographic or slide sho.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooklm/comments/1qbonx8/12\\_fabulous\\_notebooklm\\_infographic\\_slide\\_deck/](https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooklm/comments/1qbonx8/12_fabulous_notebooklm_infographic_slide_deck/)\n\nSo, I started out playing w/ making things look cool and then switched to using prompts that ask for the output to show specific things such as: find trends, show relationships, summarize plots or stories. \n\nI can even get NBLM to quickly summarize a long Youtube video and then use the slide show of infographic function to provide a short, focussed view on any given aspect of the video.\n\nAnd finally, back to books. There are tons of books I'll never get around to reading or that are from past ages that make them often quoted or referenced but I'm not going to ever read them. NBLM might be an interesting way to get a short and interesting summary.\n\nDangerous territory, but for fun, I put a PDF of the Bible's Old Testament into NBLM last night and had fun asking for summaries and asking it dumb questions. Want to know what the most commonly eaten food was? Show me the historical bloodlines and relationships of the main characters in the book and how they are related. Show me references to homosexuality - it really is in the book. There are actually 10 cases of incest. Ignore the 10 commandments and tell me what your recommendations are to live a good life according to lessons learned in the book - vastly different that what Moses brought down from the mountain and not bad advice really.\n\nHere are the main bloodlines of the main characters.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6tz9755qzveg1.png?width=2752&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ee7fb2db3a97a5ca2dea590793143f39f30bf1c\n\nIt's amazing and my apologies to anyone offended by my scholarly Bible analysis.

Today I'm excited to reveal my next project: NotebookLM-CLI.\n\n**What is it?**\n\nA full-featured command-line interface for NotebookLM. Same HTTP/RPC approach as the MCP (no browser automation, except for login process and cookie/tokens extraction), but packaged as a standalone CLI you can run directly from your terminal.\n\n  \n**Installation and example commands:**\n\n\\# Using pip\n\n    pip install notebooklm-cli\n\n\\# Using pipx (recommended for CLI tools)\n\n    pipx install notebooklm-cli\n\n\\# Using uv\n\n    uv tool install notebooklm-cli\n\nLaunch browser for login (new profile setup req upon first launch):\n\n    nlm login\n\nCreate a notebook:\n\n    nlm notebook create \"My Research\"\n\nLaunch Deep Research:\n\n    nlm research start \"AI trends 2026\" --notebook-id <id> --mode deep\n\nCreate an Audio Overview:\n\n    nlm audio create <id> --format deep_dive --confirm\n\n**Why a CLI when the MCP exists?**\n\nThe MCP is great for AI assistants (Claude, Cursor, etc.), but sometimes you just want to:\n\n\\- Script workflows in bash\n\n\\- Run quick one-off notebooklm commands without AI\n\n\\- Reduce Context window consumption by MCPs with multiple tools \n\n**Features:**\n\n🔐 Easy auth via Chrome DevTools Protocol\n\n📚 Full API coverage: notebooks, sources, research, podcasts, videos, quizzes, flashcards, mind maps, slides, infographics, data tables and configure chat prompt\n\n💬 Dedicated Chat REPL Console\n\n🏷️ Alias system for memorable shortcuts (\"myproject\" instead of UUIDs)\n\n🤖 AI-teachable: `run nlm --ai` to get documentation your AI assistant can consume\n\n🔄 Tab completion option \n\n📦 Includes a skill folder for tools with Agent Skills support (Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Codex, and more)\n\n**Demo**: \\~12 minute walkthrough on YouTube  \n[https://youtu.be/XyXVuALWZkE](https://youtu.be/XyXVuALWZkE)\n\n**Repo**:   \n[https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-cli](https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-cli)\n\nSame disclaimer as before: uses internal APIs, not affiliated with Google, may break if they change things. \n\nWould love to hear what workflows you build with it. 🚀\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0gxvu784wieg1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2d0bf0ddb375e70e1ac9b39b5737963789fc794d\n\n",

      "text": "Hi all, I've been using NotebookLM for a bit now and I haven't seen this use case after searching, so I wanted to share as it feels like an \"upgrade\" to at least on my own process of learning. \n\nT**L;DR**\n\n**I've been using large language models (LLMs) for introspective journaling for nearly a year. Recently, I discovered that by feeding this entire conversation history into NotebookLM, I can generate personalized explanations of technical concepts based on my own cognitive patterns and vocabulary. It’s proven surprisingly effective for learning.**\n\nNotebookLM finds concepts I already understand deeply (from my introspective work) and shows me where the technical framework implements those same patterns. The technical terms become labels for things I already know, not new concepts I need to memorize. It's like having a database trained on my own patterns of \"understanding\" act as translation layer between technical concepts and my own experiences. It wasn't something I set out to do, but when I stumbled upon NotebookLM it felt like a natural thing to try.\n\n  \nMy process\n\nStep 1:   \nBuild a corpus I've accumulated millions of tokens of conversations with Claude and ChatGPT over the past year. These aren't typical \"help me code X\", they're primarily introspective work: processing life transitions, exploring cognitive patterns, working through complex systems thinking, and whatever else was on my mind that I wanted to write down and reflect on.\n\nStep 2:   \nLoad into NotebookLM NotebookLM lets you upload documents as \"sources\" and query across them. I fed it my entire LLM conversation history (exported as text files).\n\nStep 3:   \nQuery for learning Instead of asking generic questions, I ask it to explain technical concepts using patterns from my conversation history. Example prompt: \"I'm learning React. Can you explain it using patterns from my exchanges with LLMs that might help it resonate with how I think?\"\n\nStep 4:   \nGet personalized translation NotebookLM analyzes the corpus, identifies my actual cognitive vocabulary (how I describe learning, what metaphors I use, what frustrates me), and explains React in those terms.\n\nWhile I'm sure it's far from perfect, the ability to relate new concepts to known experiences feels like it's not only helped me feel as if I'm learning in a more \"embodied\" way.",

However, I found the workflow of getting content *into* strictly requiring a PC or manual downloads annoying, especially on mobile.\n\nI wanted to share \"that cool video\" or \"this page of a book\" directly to my notebook without friction. So I built **Share on NotebookLM**.\n\n**What it does:** 📱 **Native Share Sheet**: Works with any app (Browser, YouTube, Gallery). 🎥 **YouTube Superpower**: It doesn't just save the link. It fetches the **Full Transcript** (auto-generated or manual) and uploads it as a clean text file. NotebookLLM eats this up perfectly. 🖼️ **Image OCR**: Take a pic of a book/document -> It extracts the text -> Uploads it. 📂 **Organized**: Saves everything into specific \"Notebooks\" (Folders) in your Google Drive, ready to be selected as a source.\n\n**It handles the messy stuff:**\n\n* Removes \"Accept Cookies\" banners from web scrapes.\n* Fixes broken XML in YouTube captions (I wrote a custom regex parser because the standard libraries were failing on some videos).\n* Lets you **Preview & Edit** the text before uploading.\n\nI'd love to hear your feedback!

You can just add NotebookLM as a source. But there's a lot of different options for studying in Gemini.

I haven't use Study Mode, but visual layout is pretty great. https://gemini.google.com/app\n\nNotebookLM has Flash Cards, Videos, etc. in Studio. Really cool to quickly get up to speed on a new topic. And you don't need to add all sources manually anymore, it has normal and deep research both within Drive and the web built in. Honestly it's pretty fucking fantastic. I could rave about it all day. UX is meh as usual, but there are good Chrome extensions for source organization. Mobile apps for both Gemini and NotebookLM are limited in functionality, I'd advise to always use the websites.\n\nTbh I have no idea when they added all those features lol. I've completely slept on it after the initial \"custom podcast\" phase for a couple of months. They have recently made it possible to use NotebookLM notebooks as context for Gemini. That + Gems + Google Workspace connector are an amazing combination for projects.\n\n/ETA: Speaking of custom podcasts, did you know that you can generate an Audio Summary just like those NotebookLM podcasts directly from a Deep Research in the Gemini web app? I can imagine that would have also saved me quite a bit of time back as a student. :D",
