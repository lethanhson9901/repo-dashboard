Can‘t edit last prompt and yeah it just isn‘t a Chatbot like Gemini and ChatGPT (of course) but still awesome.\n\nSince you can tell Gemini to use a Notebook as a reference, I am using this approach all the time but I am curious: **which approach is better? How do you use it?**\n\nAnd how often do I have to remind and re-link the Notebook in my Chat so Gemini still uses the knowledge instead of hallucinating?",

          "text": "I was hoping to see some responses because I am also wondering this, but for now I think the answer is really about when you have multiple notebooks you may wish to ask for at the same time, and/or you are working on something in Gemini but one of your notebooks may be helpful. Sadly it does seem like Gemini doesn't like having too many notebooks with a ton of sources, but I am not sure what the limits are. Gemini will say that there are too many resources for its context window and that it may have missed things.\n\nHere is where I am confused. My Google One sub lets me have notebooks of up to 300 sources. The ultra subscription lets you have 1000, which means theoretically this is achievable by the hardware. Can I bypass this limitation using multiple Notebooks and chatting in Gemini?",

A bunch of unsorted & truncated titles in a notebook with even 40 sources becomes really unwieldy really quickly.\n\n It's also strange because nbLM seems to want you to selectively toggle sources to tailor responses/output or focus on just one or two (it's a legitimately pro move vs \"use all sources all the time for everything\"), but without being able to toggle via a grouped folder of similar themes -- it makes the feature basically unusable unless you master navigating a bunch of unsorted files.",

But if you're trying to do long-form creative writing with a bevy of resource/context files for world-building and story accuracy, I find using the NotebookLM interface to be far better at holding accuracy than trying to link Notebooks to the Gemini interface. \n\nI don't really trust the regular Gemini window to capture context from multiple notebooks at once after experimenting with it. And using the same story prompts in both Gemini and NotebookLM, I found much better story accuracy and output in the NotebookLM window. \n\nThe lack of ability to edit prompts can be worked around by using a notepad file called prompt.txt or something similar, then you just prompt the main NotebookLM window to \"output based on the file 'prompt.txt' blah blah blah\" and then NotebookLM will read your prompt.txt file and output based off of it. Which gets around the character limit restrictions of the main notebookLM window **and** allows you to edit your prompt.txt file for re-outputs if you make a mistake in your prompt that you didn't catch. \n\nFor me, the main Gemini interface just doesn't handle context files well compared to using NotebookLM directly. But again, that's for very, very long form fiction rather than simply chatting with a chatbot personality so YMMV.",

                  "text": "Yes, it tends to quickly forget instructions from the window itself. \n\nMy workflow is to create a baseline plot/dialogue/scene prompt.txt file and instruct the writing to take my prompt 'kernel' and expand it into output 'popcorn.' If I tell it to do that in the window itself, it will quickly forget and revert to merely regurgitating my detailed prompts back to me.\n\nWhat I do to get around that is create a general directives.txt file. it seems to remember directives extremely well that way, and I have a header for my prompt.txt file that re-iterates the instruction to flourish dialogue and scenes with accents from my Characters.txt file and atmospherics from both my Locations.txt and Objects.txt reference files. That seems to do the trick and is a low-impact way to keep the output on track with accuracy and flair.\n\nIt seems to have a very good memory for source files but an awful atrocious memory for window inputs. This can be useful when you want to edit an output manually, which I do somewhat often, as you can then put it into a file such as '7. Day seven of story.txt' file which will imprint on the LLM over the top of the window output. So in a way, it's a good thing if you manage the tool correctly as you can overwrite it's outputs efficiently with proper uploading of the story back into it, meaning your edited version of it's output can overwrite it's own output for when you want to make corrections to any element of the output.",

It's for when I want to study a subject or interact with the literature without having to read every single word straight up. I can share a thought and have NotebookLM counter-argue and teach me based *exclusively* on those sources.\n\nWhat makes NotebookLM vital for me is the custom instructions. I tell it that its job is to teach me, point out my mistakes, and use only the sources to correct me, showing me why I'm confused and where my misconceptions might be coming from.\n\nThey are completely different tools/workflows.\n\nI’ve tried using Gems and attaching notebooks to specific convos, but I feel like Gems just add a layer of complexity that makes things worse.

      "text": "Hello Reddit,\n\nI am excited to announce a huge update on the NotebookLM MCP.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a96lg1kbvpgg1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0ddbd49448c33051ca733f6e0fef63b7c3f4224\n\n**TL;DR**: MCP and CLI are now one package. You can upload & download files directly (no browser needed). There's a skill installer for AI coding tools. And you can finally switch between Google accounts without losing your mind.\n\n**Why the big refactor?**\n\nI got tired of maintaining two packages. You probably got tired of figuring out which one to install. So I merged everything. One install, you get both tools. Done.\n\n**What's new:**\n\n**🔧 One Package, Both Tools**\n\n    uv tool install notebooklm-mcp-cli\n\nYou get nlm (the CLI) and notebooklm-mcp (the MCP server). The old separate packages are deprecated.\n\n**📤 Direct File Upload:** This one was painful to get working, but now you can upload PDFs, TXT, Markdown, and audio files directly through HTTP. No browser automation. For example:\n\n`nlm source add file /path/to/doc.pdf --wait`\n\n**🤖 Skill Installer:** If you're using Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor, or any other AI coding tool, you can install NotebookLM as a skill:\n\n`nlm skill install claude-code`\n\nIt drops the skill file where your tool expects it. You can also run nlm skill list to see what's installed. There are flags for user or project-level install.\n\n**🔐 Multi-Profile Auth:** Each profile gets its own Chrome session. So you can have your work account and personal account without logging out and back in constantly.\n\n`nlm login profile switch work`\n\n`nlm login profile list`\n\nYou can even set a default: \n\n    nlm config set auth.default_profile work\n\n**📥 Downloads That Actually Work:** You can download any artifact type now. Audio, video, reports, slides, infographics, mind maps, data tables. Quiz and flashcards come out as JSON, Markdown, or HTML.\n\n**📝 Notes:** Full CRUD. nlm note create, list, update, delete. MCP tools too.\n\n📤 **Export to Google Workspace:** Data Tables go to Sheets. Reports go to Docs. For example:\n\n    nlm export to-sheets <notebook> --artifact-id <id>\n\nAlso in this release:\n\n✅ Sharing API (public links, invite collaborators)\n\n✅ Dual CLI syntax (i.e, Verb-first and noun-first, for example: nlm notebook list OR nlm list notebooks)\n\n✅ Aliases (use names instead of UUIDs)\n\n✅ Interactive chat mode\n\n✅ HTTP transport for MCP (community PR)\n\n✅ Auto re-auth (survives token expiration)\n\n✅ MCP consolidated to 28 tools DESPITE adding more functionality\n\nThe workflow I'm using daily:\n\nCreate a notebook, upload some PDFs, run deep research, import the sources, generate a podcast and briefing doc, export the briefing to Docs, share it publicly. All from the terminal. No touching the UI.\n\nI'm honestly using the CLI more than the MCP at this point (through AI of course); maybe this will change when more tools have the MCP lazy load. It's just feels faster than the MCP when the AI uses it.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp-cli](https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp-cli)\n\n**Demo**: Check the README for video walkthroughs (or click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQBQigFK-E8))\n\nGo crazy. Level up your second brain game.\n\nHappy to answer questions or hear about bugs. \n\nStill a passion vibe-coding project, still maintaining it as Google changes things under the hood. At least now it will be easier to add and maintain as a unified MCP/CLI project.\n\n",

      "text": "I’ve been using NotebookLM to generate slides for client demos, mostly to explain processes or efficiency improvements. The generated content itself is actually pretty solid and saves me a lot of prep time.\n\nWhere I usually get stuck is after export. I almost always need to make small edits (wording, layout, rearranging a slide or two) before sharing it with clients.\n\nI ended up Googling to make the exported PPT easier to edit and tried a PDF/PPT conversion tool(PDNob). For my use case, it helped turn the slides into fully editable content pretty quickly.\n\nWhat I liked:\n\nText stays clean and readable after conversion\n\nSlide structure doesn’t get messed up\n\nEasy to jump in and make quick edits\n\nWhat could be better:\n\nNo batch conversion (had to do files one at a time)\n\nImages sometimes need minor manual adjustment\n\nAnyway, it’s been useful when I need to polish NotebookLM-generated slides right before a meeting quickly.\n\nCurious how you guys handle multiple conversions? Or use other tools/workflows?\n\nMany thanks for any suggestions🙏",

If I need speed + editability, I export from NotebookLM → Google Slides, then do final polish there (layout tweaks, phrasing, hierarchy). It preserves structure better and avoids text being “flattened”.\n\nFor multiple conversions:\n\t•\tGoogle Slides API + Drive batch import (even semi-manual) scales better than PDF tools.\n\t•\tIf PPT is mandatory, I batch-clean using Slide Master + Find/Replace rules instead of per-slide edits.\n\t•\tFor visuals, I assume light manual adjustment is unavoidable with AI-generated slides—no tool fully solves that yet.\n\nRule of thumb:\nPDF tools are fine for last-minute fixes, but for repeatable workflows, staying native (Slides → Slides / PPT → PPT) saves more time long term.\n\nCurious if Google will expose more granular export controls in NotebookLM—would remove 80% of this friction.",

I have a prompt that says something like \"Create a presentation following this artistic style [insert here art style chosen] and addressing ALL the following subjects according to the source [insert here list of subjects].\"\n\nThen I remind it to include down in the right corner a miniature of a book with the title of the book and on top-left the subject addressed in that slide (for having more context while I study them).\n\nI also have the same Gem trained to, once the presentation is finished, check if all the subjects it listed are included in it (I upload the PDF) and give back a % of coverage. It's usually 95% or so. \n\nThis method works great, although I do it like a hobby, I don't know if this would be perfect for complex exams.\n\nEdit, forgot this: how many bookmarks to include into the Gem at the beginning depends on you. I usually try to choose accordingly so the presentation has coherence, this is something you try and learn, but it's also a matter of choice (usually each presentation has 15 slides) so that should be taken into account.\n\nAlso sorry for my English.",

Personally I find it really weak in terms of uncovering novel new stuff or enabling deeper knowledge on something you're an highly experienced in, but that wasn't the goal and can also reflect how narrow or wide the spectrum is.\n\n - Book or podcast companion: for longform podcasts or YT videos it's FANTASTIC at being a read-along chat. I'm using it for books more as well.\n\n\nIn the professional domain where I'm knowledgeable: I amusingly have found a lot of value in using the interactive podcast mode to \"chat with my ideas,\" and have it discuss or articulate back in a non-jargony way. It's really nice when it's a narrow technical topic that can you rarely get to verbally explore the topic versus just text/technical/doing.\n\nIn the \"new topic discovery\" way, combined with deep research and high-effort source curation for things like research papers or long-form interviews it makes otherwise inaccessible source material A LOT more interesting and engaging.\n\n\nWhat it doesn't compete with: my primary knowledge base/notes system (I really wish it had bidirectionality with markdown notes). It's inferior to an IDE workflow (that's okay!), or early/adhoc exploration for a topic directly in a web-chat. \n\nI treat it more as a companion when I want to \"doubleclick\" on something narrow versus broad... and treat notebooks more ephemeral than I would with my KB.",

To work around this, I started splitting prompts into multiple parts and then merging the outputs in Sheets. This significantly improves coverage and completeness, since it forces the model to process most of the document.\n\nIt’s still not perfect, and it doesn’t always go through the entire file. I suspect this is related to context window limits. That said, I’m genuinely impressed by how well it follows structured prompts, and the results are often phenomenal given the constraints.\n\n🤔 Curious to hear your thoughts, comments, or experiences with similar large-document extraction tasks.

You can use some programmable logic to find uniqueness, de-duplicate entries, and identify the best matches. Even ChatGPT can help at that stage if you’re working in Sheets or a similar setup.  \n  \nIt’s still a bit frustrating and requires some manual work, but honestly, compared to doing everything manually, it’s a HUGE help 🙂.

Things were always slightly off, which was annoying since the rest of the deck actually looked great. Like I just want to fix this one or two slides and it's ready.\n\nSo I thought, why not just fix the broken slide with AI? I tried screenshotting the problematic slide and having Gemini Pro edit it, and it worked well. It preserved the original design, fonts, spacing, everything.\n\nThe downside was how tiring and cumbersome it was. Editing the PDF, recompiling everything, replacing the slide, converting to PPT, doing AI edits one at a time (AI edits are slow asf), and then last thing i know I hitmy rate limit. I just want to fix a small mistake. I just want something quick and does the job.\n\nSo I ended up hacking together my own thing. For my use-case, I didn't need full editability. Just being able to patch hallucinations quickly while preserving the original design mattered way more to me.\n\nOne unexpected bonus was I was able to generate NEW slides that still matched the original look, which ended up being super useful for me, then to be able to easily export it as PPTX.\n\nGuess I can't link it here directly but if this is a pain point for you too, please let me know so I can send you a DM!",

As a consequence, X will become more and more a source of high-quality content that will be worth saving for our research.\n\n**What's new:**\n\n* **Tweets & Threads**: Save any tweet, or capture an entire thread as a single source. The extension automatically detects when a tweet is part of a thread and grabs all connected posts — no manual stitching required.\n* **Articles**: Save articles shared on X directly to your notebooks.\n* **Two ways to save**: Use the Web Clipper buttons that appear on X, or save from the side panel with one click.\n\nIf you're following expert takes, industry discussions, or breaking news on X, you can now pull that content straight into NotebookLM.\n\nCurious if anyone here uses X (Twitter) as a research source? If so, do you save single tweets, threads or articles?\n\nAny feedback appreciate 🙏",

So reordering and deleting is easy, editing is not possible. A workaround - Claude then extracted the text from slides and created a text-only ppt, fully editable. If I wanted to edit something (not much, just some wording), I could copy parts of the text and paste over the \"image slides\", covering the original text. Yes, it's clunky.

So, you copy the slide, post in GPT or Gemini, prompt it “remove all text and polish for clarity”, then paste the refined graphic into PowerPoint,  and add the perfect text.\n\nYeah, still work, but no special skills required.\n\nHope it helps - share your best LM workarounds below.  🏆🥃",

Import highlights from Kindle Cloud Reader into Glasp\n2. Copy them OR download them as Markdown\n3. Paste or upload into NotebookLM as a source\n\nI’ve been testing it for research + studying, and it’s nice being able to ask questions across multiple books.\n\nIf anyone is interested, I wrote a step-by-step tutorial here:  \n[How to Import Kindle Highlights into NotebookLM with Glasp](https://glasp.co/posts/how-to-import-kindle-highlights-into-notebooklm-with-glasp)",

Some students find interesting, though I personally don't like them. You can create a set with based on the vocabulary list, or based on the text itself (reading comprehension). \n\nA quiz.\n\nThe audio brief. Here it's important to make sure NLM understand this is for teaching purpose, and the level you are learning, so that the brief is limited in vocabulary and grammar patterns appropriate for the level. What I could not manage to do was to have the narrators use a fully enunciated pronunciation, to make it easier to understand. But I tell students to lower the playback speed to 0.75 and that helps.\n\nFor the following excerpts I add two sources: the new excerpt and the list of words from the previous excerpts, so that NLM creates its materials focusing on new vocabulary only.\n\nI use excerpts from The Wizard of Oz, which is a classic book with a relatively easy vocabulary. You should of course be able to find similarly good texts in Spanish. ",
