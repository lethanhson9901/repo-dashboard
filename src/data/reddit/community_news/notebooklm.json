Completeness is decent, but the style and layout often drift from the original.  \n\n\nQuestion 2. Very limited visual styles  \nThe default NotebookLM slides feel quite template-ish.  \nI’ve experimented with prompt-based style hints and documented some of them here:  \n[https://github.com/serenakeyitan/awesome-notebookLM-prompts](https://github.com/serenakeyitan/awesome-notebookLM-prompts)\n\n  \nCurious if people have found a better or more sustainable workflow?",

It's so straightforward it feels like a hack.\n\nI teach high school science, use NBLM for creating slide decks for whole chapters or more narrowly hard-to-underatand sections. Infographics make awesome visual review tools. From NBLM on your PC, download/save to your local GDrive file directory tree. Open GDrive app on your tablet, select the saved PDF, select \"send to\" and choose the SNote app. It'll conveniently ask you if you want to create a new Note file or append to one that already exists. Boom, now the NBLM PDF is on your tablet in SNote.\n\nHand edit as desired using stylus and pens, or type over, or copy-paste graphics like rectangles that match the background colors to \"blank out\" things you don't want to see like watermarks or misspellings. (Teacher tip: \"send to\" the SNote app your empty or incomplete notes, then teach from your tablet wirelessly projecting as you add/complete the notes live on-screen; helps engagement during note sessions).\n\nWhen finished editing, click the share icon and you're presented with a selection of like a dozen different export formats from individual images per slide, or our fav PDF, and others you may find useful. Then for destination app you select GDrive. Select the original file name to overwrite if you like or give a new name for new version. Set the destination directory and boom, you're done. Back to your PC for new work in NBLM.\n\nThe SNote app has always been a great sleeper of an app for teachers who know how to use it. All I had to do was purchase a $30 wireless adapter dongle, plug into the projector or smartboard HDMI input. Game changer.",

All the other elements were exactly the same as the original snip.\n\nWhat I found when generating presentation slides, be specific what you want it to produce by editing the prompt inside the presentation tool.\n\nIt does a phenomenal job.

But for some terms (Yellow fever, Waldenstrom), the notebook setup dramatically affects how relevant NotebookLM thinks the topic is. Yellow fever scored 55 in the content-only notebook but only 5 in the MCQ-only notebook - a 50-point swing. This suggests RAG retrieval quality varies significantly by how you organize your sources.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wip1b8utcrdg1.png?width=1785&format=png&auto=webp&s=f488e607cdbf1af2ef23df73ab1e16bdc7e858c2\n\n *Figure 3: Relevance score variance across configurations.

That is why I had to settle on having GPT-4o-mini just take each image as input and have its output be the text that it sees. That worked, albeit very slowly. I had to set 8 concurrent models going to have it complete within a day.",

So, I decided to convert each of my PDFs into MD format and tested things out to compare across a few different variables (speed of chat completion, quality of text output, quantity of multiple choice questions retrieved from the sources, etc.). Then, once it was clear that markdown > PDFs, I considered whether 1 markdown NotebookLM with both textbooks & multiple choice practice tests would be better or worse than 2 NotebookLM's (one for the textbook and another for the MCQ practice tests). I wasn't sufficiently happy with how the MCQ practice test setup was so I modified the customization settings and that resulted in v2. \n\nAfter all of that setup/analysis, I determined that for my workflow, and likely for others as well, one NotebookLM w/ PDF sources < one NotebookLM w/ markdown sources < multiple NotebookLMs w/ markdown sources separated by niche/format/etc. (for me this separation was textbook and MCQs as I wanted to optimize the chatbot's retrieval of textbook- and MCQ-relevant text from my sources).\n\nI hope that clears things up a bit. I'm happy to elaborate more if interested.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\nI know there have been a few scripts floating around here to download podcasts or upload files, but I found most of them relied heavily on browser automation (Selenium/Playwright) for every single action. This made them slow and prone to breaking whenever the UI changed.\nI wanted a robust solution for building actual pipelines, so I spent some time reverse-engineering the internal RPCs (Protobufs) to build a proper Python SDK.\nIt’s called notebooklm-py.\nHow this differs from previous scripts:\nNo Selenium Runtime: Unlike wrappers that drive a browser in the background, this library talks directly to the backend API. It’s lightweight and fast. (Note: You only need a browser once for the initial auth).\nFull Feature Parity: It’s not just a downloader. You can create notes, manage sources, pin citations, and query the RAG engine programmatically.\nStability: I treat this like a production library. It has a triple-layer test suite (Unit, Integration, E2E) that runs daily to catch backend changes before they break your code.\nClaude Code Integration: I added a module that lets you install this as a \"Skill\" for the Claude CLI, allowing you to query your notebooks from the terminal.\nUse Case:\nI built this to automate \"Deep Research\" loops—scripting the creation of notebooks, uploading PDFs, and auto-generating Audio Overviews without touching the browser.\nRepo: [https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py)\nIt’s open source (MIT). If you are tired of brittle automation scripts, give this a try and let me know what you think.",

      "text": "I've been trying to using NotebookLM heavily for the past few weeks. If I just need to memorize something or make things with all the studio features, its been fine. And the source grounding and stuff like the podcasts are pretty cool.\n\nBut I feel friction when I am trying for actual learn, write, etc, and I wanted to see if others are feeling the same or they have better workflows.\n\nMy main issue is that despite the name, it feels far more like a chatbot than a notebook or workspace.\n\n* A real workspace should be dynamic. I want to move ideas around, group them, and treat them like objects. Currently, everything feels rigid. I ask a question, get a text block, and that's it. And my sources are just huge unorganized list on the left. It doesn't feel like I'm building a notebook, its more like just texting a smart search engine.\n* When asking questions, the insights are great, but they are trapped in that a one dimensional chat thread (a singular one too, since theres no separate chats).\n* I feel like I'm reading about the work rather than doing it. Because I'm not actively organizing or working with the info myself (highlighting specific connections, restructuring or rewriting stuff), it doesn't stick as well nor does it compound into something useful.\n* If I want the AI to actually know about the notes I'm writing, I have to jump through hoops: save a response to a Note, export that Note to Google Docs, and then reimport that Doc as a new source. It breaks the flow completely just to get the model to see my own work\n* Side note: I'd like to be able to switch models or also use non google ones too\n\nHow are you all handling this? Are you just using it for quick answers, or have you found a workflow where it actually feels like a workspace?",

You add research cards on different things. \n\nThen you can make mind maps and find good pathways to learn.\n\nI often use my googlenotebooklm research into a Claude project with custom instructions to create projects or I use it to help guide my blog writing etc. \n\nLearnyourway is a cool idea into personalised learning, I feel like it needs more things like this with workflows.",

              "text": "I've been working with prompt engineering and LLM architecture for a while now, and I've noticed a very common error pattern: we try to create a single \"Super Prompt\" that tries to be everything at once (programmer, tester, writer, security analyst).\n\n\nThe result? The model hallucinates, forgets instructions in the middle of the text, and delivers generic outputs.\n\n\nTo solve this, I developed within NotebookLM and validated in production a framework that I call the **\"Orchestrator-Agent Pattern\"**. The idea is to stop treating AI like a chat and treat it like a **CLI (Command Line Interface)** with deterministic routing.\n\n\nI want to share the blueprint of this architecture adapted for a **Software House / DevOps** scenario, so you can apply it to your projects (works very well in NotebookLM, Claude Projects or Custom GPTs).\n\n\n---\n\n### 🏗️ The Architecture: The \"Team OS\"\n\nThe logic is to divide the intelligence into three layers:\n\n\n1. **The Router:** The main System Prompt. It does not resolve tasks. It understands the intent and invokes the specialist.\n\n2. **The Specialists:** Modular prompts injected via RAG (Knowledge Base). They only know how to do ONE thing.\n\n3. **The Truth (Ground Truth):** Company Manuals, Style Guides, and Docs.\n\n### 1. The Master Prompt (The Router)\n\nYour System Prompt should not be \"You are helpful.\" It should be a Rigid Menu.\n\n```markdown\n# SYSTEM PROMPT: DEV-NEXUS ORCHESTRATOR\n\n<core_identity>\nYou are not a chatbot. You are DEV-NEXUS, the team's intelligence engine.\n\nYour role is to process inputs, consult your EXPERT MODULES, and deliver technical artifacts.\n\n</core_identity>\n\n<prime_directives>\n⛔ ZERO CHITCHAT: Never start with \"Hello\".\n\n⛔ MANDATORY MENU: Every reply must end with the Options Menu.\n\n</prime_directives>\n\n<ROUTER_MENU>\nChoose the execution module:\n0. [MENU] Quick Menu\n1. 👨‍💻 [ARCHITECT] Code Review & Refactoring (SOLID/Clean Code)\n2. 🛡️ [SEC-OPS] Security Audit (OWASP Top 10)\n3. 📄 [DOCS] Documentation Generator (Readme/API Specs)\n</ROUTER_MENU>\n\n<EXECUTION_LOGIC>\nIf the user enters \"1\": Activate the \"ARCHITECT\" sub-agent. See \"StyleGuide.md\".\n\nIf the user enters \"2\": Activate the \"SEC-OPS\" sub-agent. Ignore style, focus on vulnerability.\n\n</EXECUTION_LOGIC>\n\n```\n\n### 2. The Trick: Sub-agents via RAG\n\nHere's the secret. Instead of putting all the rules in the main prompt, you create text files (`SUBAGENTE_SEC_OPS.txt`) and upload them to the knowledge base (RAG).\n\n\nWhen the Router decides to activate \"SEC-OPS\", it looks for this file. The template \"wears the mask\" of this specific agent.\n\n\n**Example from `SUBAGENTE_SEC_OPS.txt`:**\n\n```markdown\n<<<SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION::SEC_OPS_AGENT>>>\n\nIDENTITY: You are a Security Auditor (Red Team).\n\nTARGETS: OWASP Top 10, Hardcoded Secrets, SQL Injection.\n\n\nPROTOCOLS:\n- NEVER correct the code without first explaining the vulnerability.\n\n- CLASSIFY each risk as: 🔴 CRITICAL, 🟡 MEDIUM or 🟢 LOW.\n\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT (Required):\n| Risk | File | Line | CVE/Type | Suggestion for Fix |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 🔴 | auth.js | 42 | Hardcoded Token | Use .env |\n\n\n```\n\n### 3. Why does this work? (The Engineering behind it)\n\n1. **Cognitive Compartmentalization:** When the model is in \"SEC-OPS\" mode, it doesn't spend tokens trying to be polite or format pretty indentation. It focuses 100% on finding flaws.\n\n2. **Context Anchoring:** The menu forces the user to be objective. If the user sends a \"hi\", the system returns the menu. This professionalizes the interaction.\n\n3. **Hallucination Reduction:** Because the sub-agent has strict formatting instructions (e.g., Markdown tables), the model fills in gaps instead of generating creative text.\n\n### Where to apply?\n\n* **Marketing:** Router -> 1. Copywriter (AIDA), 2. SEO Analyst, 3. Tone of Voice Reviewer.\n* **Legal:** Router -> 1. Contract Analyst, 2. Jurisprudence Researcher, 3. Compliance Reviewer.\n* **Dev:** The example above.\n\n\nIf you are suffering from unstable prompts, try breaking the architecture this way. The consistency gain is absurd.\n\n\nFor my business I only have one word: perfect! This was said by the collaborators!\n\n\nHas anyone else here implemented this \"Router + Sub-agents\" logic via RAG?",

I'll post a few more slides from the same deck after this one.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xgy4drurqbdg1.png?width=1620&format=png&auto=webp&s=abe5fe262587db2136e0e8caec3eca9427ece182\n\nCreate an illustrated explainer slide deck in a hand-drawn technical sketch style, blending engineering notebook aesthetics with conceptual storytelling. Use a light grid-paper or drafting-paper background throughout. Illustrations should be rendered in precise black ink linework with controlled watercolor washes, evoking architectural and engineering sketches rather than playful illustration.\n\nVisuals should balance creativity and rigor: diagrams, cutaways, schematics, optimization plots, flow arrows, annotations, formulas, and marginal notes. Illustrations should feel like they come from a professional’s working notebook — analytical, intentional, and grounded in real-world constraints.\n\nUse visual metaphors sparingly but powerfully (blueprints, tools, systems, apprentices vs masters, black boxes, validation marks). Pair artistic imagery with technical structure.\n\nTypography: clean, technical, lightly hand-drawn or drafting-inspired lettering with strong hierarchy. Titles are declarative and confident; body text is concise and explanatory.\\*\\*\n\nColor palette: restrained and professional — cool blues, steel grays, muted ochres, soft graphite tones. Watercolor is used to emphasize regions, flows, or contrasts, not decoration. Red is reserved for warnings, constraints, or regulatory emphasis.\\*\\*\n\nLayout principles:\n\n– One core argument per slide\n\n– Diagram-first, text-second\n\n– Clear left/right or before/after comparisons\n\n– Marginal annotations and callouts\n\nTone: authoritative, reflective, systems-oriented. Treats the audience as capable professionals.\\*\\*\n\nOverall aesthetic: high-end technical editorial, architect’s sketchbook, engineering reasoning made visible.\\*\\*\n\nAvoid playful illustration, stock visuals, or flat presentation graphics. Prioritize technical credibility, hand-drawn precision, and professional seriousness.",

Use large, bold, sans-serif titles (using Impact font in all caps) as the main focus, and pair them with a single brush-script word (in Gistesy font) layered or overlapping for emphasis. It should be part of the heading phrase. Keep each slide to one short phrase or sentence rather than paragraphs or dense bullets. Use layouts with a lot of white space and one prominent photo or cropped image (often off to one side) that supports the idea on the slide. Avoid icons, clip art, and busy backgrounds. Overall, the deck should feel modern, editorial, and minimal: a bold headline, one expressive image, one script-accent word to begin or end the headline, and plenty of breathing room on every slide.",

You don't need to upload a PDF about apples for the LLM to understand what an apple or a fruit is.\n\nNotebookLM isn't a closed knowledge vacuum, there's still an LLM in the loop (a Gemini model) which of course is trained on a vast amount of knowledge. The notebook environment is designed to primarily work with uploaded sources, but it's still fundamentally baked in with broader information that comes with an LLM when you're chatting or generating studio output. So if you ask about some (in your case) legal law concept, it can reference a wider slice of it's existing knowledge. It didn't \"google it on the spot,\" if that's how you're interpreting it?\n\nImportantly: There's no such thing as \"hallucination-proof,\" with AI, that's wasn't a good assumption to begin with (which hey, all this stuff is rapidly evolving and complicated, it's a totally understandable confusion!).",

When I try to get it to make podcast summaries of stories I’ve written it gets details wrong every time. Misattributes actions to characters. Gets plot sequences out of order. It’s just as flawed as the other LLMs out there.",

By contrast, all the studio features generally have access to the information available to all LLM’s. This hasn’t really been an issue at all as they stick to the sources and just use ‘outside’ sources to explain further. \n\nThink of it this way, if it was essentially just regurgitating what’s written in your sources what’s the point of an audio overview then when you can just read. As far as my experience goes, however, it only pulls outside information to further explain a point but it doesn’t add points or topics straight up from itself.",

I specifically started using NLM because I thought it was just regurgitating the source back to me in a more accessible format. So I’m fully shocked they’ve been adding in other info and it’s funny how sarcastic everyone is being because how else would I know only the chat was hallucination-free 🤷🏾‍♂️\n\nAnd now I don’t know what to trust, how do I know it’s not pulling in additional topics. Now I feel like I need to review the source in depth which defeats the purpose.",
