Let NotebookLM index them so it \"knows\" your project.\n * Connect to Gemini:\n   * Open Gemini.\n   * In the chat box, click the plus (+) icon (the attachment menu).\n   * Select NotebookLM from the options (alongside Drive, Photos, etc.).\n * Select Your Notebook:\n   * A list of your notebooks will appear. Select the one(s) relevant to your current task.\n   * Tip: You can attach multiple notebooks to a single Gemini thread to synthesize information across different projects.\n * Prompt Gemini with Grounding:\n   * Ask questions like: \"Based on my 'Project X' notebook, draft a project proposal that also incorporates current 2026 market trends from the web.\"\n   * Gemini will now use your private data as the primary source of truth while filling in gaps with its general knowledge.\n\n\n💡 Use Case Example: Research to Interactive Dashboard\nImagine you are a researcher or a business lead tracking a new industry trend.\n * The Problem: You have 50+ PDFs and 10 recorded meetings in NotebookLM, but it's hard to visualize the \"big picture\" or share it with a team in a fun way.\n * The Integrated Solution:\n   * Attach your research notebook to a Gemini thread.\n   * Prompt: \"Analyze the competitive landscape from my notes and create an interactive strategy board. Use your 'Canvas' feature to make it a dynamic dashboard with filters for 'Cost' and 'Risk'.\"\n   * The Result: Gemini uses its coding capabilities to build a live, functional dashboard in the chat, but every data point is pulled directly from your verified sources in NotebookLM.\n\n🚀 Why This Matters\n| Feature | Standalone NotebookLM | Gemini + NotebookLM Integration |\n|---|---|---|\n| Data Scope | Only the sources you upload. | Your sources + real-time web browsing. |\n| Output Style | Text-based notes/summaries. | Interactive apps, charts, and complex code. |\n| History | Chat history is notebook-specific. | Persistent chat history in the main Gemini app. |\n| Context | Single notebook focus. | Can \"bridge\" multiple notebooks together. |",

Sprinkle Gems and Workspace tools (mail, drive, keep, tasks, docs, calendar...) on top and throw everything you need to remember at Gemini via Android assistant. I hate that it's Google 😂 but it's working together so well I'm willing to endure Google's stubborn refusal to fix their horribly bad mobile apps. \n\nI use it like this a lot, but tbh still haven't really developed a feeling for how broad or narrow to keep my Notebooks. Learning on the go. \n\nAnd obviously source organization is shit, but there are millions of chrome extensions for it. One open source I've read about earlier would be foldLM, but I haven't had a chance to try it yet.\n\n\n/ETA also don't fall in love, I fully expect Google to discontinue NotebookLM for no reason whatsoever as soon as it's feature complete. 🙄",

Previously, NotebookLM could only read text (like PDFs or Google Docs). Now, you can upload audio recordings directly into the platform.\n\nOnce uploaded, NotebookLM automatically generates a written transcript of the recording. This transforms your audio from a \"locked\" sound file into searchable, analyzable text. You can then interact with this audio just like any other document—asking the AI to summarize it, find specific quotes, or combine its insights with your other notes.\n\n**Key Benefits:**\n\n* **Searchability:** Instantly find what was said in a clear text format without re-listening to hours of audio.\n* **Deep Analysis:** Use the AI to extract themes, action items, or specific details that might be easy to miss.\n* **Time Savings:** Eliminate the tedious manual work of typing out meeting notes or interview transcripts.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m3p5y6rih2fg1.png?width=854&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad64de558f6cbfab2d852bf91f8c21fad61ef93d\n\n",

It's a game-changer for research. However, I found the workflow of getting content *into* strictly requiring a PC or manual downloads annoying, especially on mobile.\n\nI wanted to share \"that cool video\" or \"this page of a book\" directly to my notebook without friction. So I built **Share on NotebookLM**.\n\n**What it does:**   \n📱 **Native Share Sheet**: Works with any app (Browser, YouTube, Gallery).  \n 🎥 **YouTube Superpower**: It doesn't just save the link. It fetches the **Full Transcript** (auto-generated or manual) and uploads it as a clean text file. NotebookLLM eats this up perfectly.   \n🖼️ **Image OCR**: Take a pic of a book/document -> It extracts the text -> Uploads it.   \n📂 **Organized**: Saves everything into specific \"Notebooks\" (Folders) in your Google Drive, ready to be selected as a source.\n\n**It handles the messy stuff:**\n\n* Removes \"Accept Cookies\" banners from web scrapes.\n* Fixes broken XML in YouTube captions (I wrote a custom regex parser because the standard libraries were failing on some videos).\n* Lets you **Preview & Edit** the text before uploading.\n\nI'd love to hear your feedback! It's currently in Beta/MVP.\n\n**🔥 UPDATE (v0.2): New Features Just Added!** Based on early feedback, I've pushed a huge update:\n\n* **🌎 Internationalization**: Fully translated to **English & Spanish** (Automatic detection).\n* **🔊 Audio Import**: Share audio files (e.g., from WhatsApp) directly. Uploads as audio or **auto-transcribes** to text (if you have an OpenAI API Key).\n* **🎨 New Design**: Complete UI overhaul with a professional, card-based Preview Modal.\n* **🧵 Thread Unroller**: Automatically extracts clean conversations from **Reddit & Twitter/X** (no more messy screenshots or clutter).\n* **🧠 Reader Mode**: Smart web scraping that removes ads/popups before uploading.\n* **📹 YouTube Enhancements**: Better transcript extraction for auto-generated captions.\n\n**Looking for Testers!** I'm looking for people to try this out and tell me what breaks (or what you love). Comment below or DM me if you want to join the TestFlight / Google Play Beta!\n\n>🚀 **Join here:** [https://forms.gle/Tv4i1X6KhiQXb6mV7](https://forms.gle/Tv4i1X6KhiQXb6mV7)\n\nIf you are on **Android**, select that option and I'll send you the APK link via email this week. For **iOS**, I'm organizing the TestFlight slots, so make sure to register so I can send you the invite code!\"",

I work full time so i have to optimize my time, even though I have already studied various topics during university. I was planning to use notebooklm to summarize the books I have to study and I have some questions:\n-do you think notebook lm is reliable on doing this task and can it focus on things that are relevant to the topic?\n-what prompt do you guys think can return a good summarization? A simple \"summarize it\" is enough?\n-is it better to give notebook lm the entire book or upload chapter by chapter?",

You can easily get a text summary in the main chat section but the studio features for making info grafix and slide shows and such as amazing. \n\nHere is the post that first got me going w/ the idea that you can even add anything to an infographic or slide sho.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooklm/comments/1qbonx8/12\\_fabulous\\_notebooklm\\_infographic\\_slide\\_deck/](https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooklm/comments/1qbonx8/12_fabulous_notebooklm_infographic_slide_deck/)\n\nSo, I started out playing w/ making things look cool and then switched to using prompts that ask for the output to show specific things such as: find trends, show relationships, summarize plots or stories. \n\nI can even get NBLM to quickly summarize a long Youtube video and then use the slide show of infographic function to provide a short, focussed view on any given aspect of the video.\n\nAnd finally, back to books. There are tons of books I'll never get around to reading or that are from past ages that make them often quoted or referenced but I'm not going to ever read them. NBLM might be an interesting way to get a short and interesting summary.\n\nDangerous territory, but for fun, I put a PDF of the Bible's Old Testament into NBLM last night and had fun asking for summaries and asking it dumb questions. Want to know what the most commonly eaten food was? Show me the historical bloodlines and relationships of the main characters in the book and how they are related. Show me references to homosexuality - it really is in the book. There are actually 10 cases of incest. Ignore the 10 commandments and tell me what your recommendations are to live a good life according to lessons learned in the book - vastly different that what Moses brought down from the mountain and not bad advice really.\n\nHere are the main bloodlines of the main characters.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6tz9755qzveg1.png?width=2752&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ee7fb2db3a97a5ca2dea590793143f39f30bf1c\n\nIt's amazing and my apologies to anyone offended by my scholarly Bible analysis.

      "text": "Hey everyone! 👋 \n\nI've been frustrated with AI coding assistants hallucinating answers when I ask about my own documentation, codebase specs, or research papers. So I built **nblm** — a skill/plugin that connects your AI coding agent directly to Google NotebookLM.\n\n# The problem it solves:\n\n* 🧠 **Hallucinations** — AI makes up answers instead of citing your actual docs\n* ⚡ **Context switching** — Constantly jumping between NotebookLM web UI and your editor\n* 📚 **Limited sources** — NotebookLM only accepts URLs/files/YouTube, but I want to add books from Z-Library, papers from arXiv, etc.\n\n# Links:\n\n* **GitHub:** [https://github.com/magicseek/nblm](https://github.com/magicseek/nblm)\n* **Install:** `npx add-skill magicseek/nblm`\n\n# What nblm does:\n\n    /nblm ask \"What does our API spec say about authentication?\"\n    /nblm upload ./design-doc.pdf\n    /nblm podcast --wait --output ./deep-dive.mp3\n\nThat's it. Your AI agent now has access to Gemini-powered Q&A grounded entirely in YOUR documents.\n\n# Features:\n\n* Works with **Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Codex, Copilot**\n* One-command install: `npx add-skill magicseek/nblm`\n* Upload files, URLs, YouTube videos, Z-Library books\n* Generate podcasts, slides, infographics from your notebooks\n* Extensible plugin architecture for future sources (arXiv, Notion, Confluence planned)\n\n# How it works:\n\nUses [notebooklm-py](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py) for API operations and [agent-browser](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser) as a fallback for things NotebookLM doesn't expose via API (like file uploads and auth). Would love feedback! What sources would you want to connect to NotebookLM? I'm thinking arXiv, Notion, and Confluence next.\n\nWelcome to contribute via making PRs, don't forget to star it if you like.",

It has been doing a great work explaining stuff and auditing my input. I work in finance and I am good at triple checking complex work.\n\nI filed with TurboTax last year and they charged me a good amount for a premium tier since I made personal income in two states and had a rental property in a third one.

Forgot to add this in my post but last year my partner filed through Turbo Tax and we had to pay for a premium tier which costed us more than $500 to end up with incorrect filing (partially due to the employer).

I haven't use Study Mode, but visual layout is pretty great. https://gemini.google.com/app\n\nNotebookLM has Flash Cards, Videos, etc. in Studio. Really cool to quickly get up to speed on a new topic. And you don't need to add all sources manually anymore, it has normal and deep research both within Drive and the web built in. Honestly it's pretty fucking fantastic. I could rave about it all day. UX is meh as usual, but there are good Chrome extensions for source organization. Mobile apps for both Gemini and NotebookLM are limited in functionality, I'd advise to always use the websites.\n\nTbh I have no idea when they added all those features lol. I've completely slept on it after the initial \"custom podcast\" phase for a couple of months. They have recently made it possible to use NotebookLM notebooks as context for Gemini. That + Gems + Google Workspace connector are an amazing combination for projects.\n\n/ETA: Speaking of custom podcasts, did you know that you can generate an Audio Summary just like those NotebookLM podcasts directly from a Deep Research in the Gemini web app? I can imagine that would have also saved me quite a bit of time back as a student. :D",

I have terrible ADHD, which makes me quite disorganized with my files. I'm working on my final vocational training project, and it generates a lot of documents, even for my classes, that are required for the project and are completed throughout the course.\n\nBecause of this, I use NotebookLM to ask what's missing, to find inconsistencies, and to help me organize everything so it all makes sense. This helps me put my ideas in order.\n\nI also use it for data analysis and sometimes for doing assignments because I'm short on time and often don't have time to sit down and do them myself.\n\nI have to say it's a very useful tool that, when used properly, is very powerful. Since it doesn't have its own fonts and I only have a partial internet connection, I use it daily. Being able to listen to a podcast in my language on the bus, with very convincing voices in Spanish, about what I have to prepare or study is useful.\n\nAlso, Gemini 3 and the history feature make conversations meaningful and give them a thread, allowing me to ask for corrections and reminders. The ability to build and add on the fly is fundamental for me.\n\nI'm missing something in the package along with calendars, tasks, and classroom to be able to set work times and reach my goals, but I understand that's not its function and I'll have to do it manually.\n\nBut in short, it's the best thing that's ever happened to me, and I highly recommend it.\n\nI just need to learn how to make less lazy prompts and see how powerful NotebookLM can be as a source of Gemini gems.",

          "text": "I asked Gemini \n\nI understand the confusion—Google recently rebranded and restructured its AI subscriptions, and the naming can be a bit of a maze.\nTo answer your main question: NotebookLM itself is still free, but Google has introduced a paid \"Pro\" tier (branded as Google AI Pro) that offers significantly higher limits. In Canada, this plan is priced at $26.99 CAD/month.\nHere is the breakdown of how the subscription works and what it means for your NotebookLM access:\n1. Is NotebookLM under Google AI Pro?\nYes and no. NotebookLM follows a \"freemium\" model:\n * The Free Tier: You can still use NotebookLM for free with your standard Google account. It includes up to 100 notebooks and 50 sources per notebook.\n * The Pro Tier: When you subscribe to Google AI Pro, your NotebookLM experience is upgraded to what was previously called \"NotebookLM Plus.\" You’ll see a \"Pro\" badge next to your profile.\n2. Why the $26.99 CAD price tag?\nThe $26.99 CAD price is the standard Canadian rate for the Google AI Pro plan (formerly known as the AI Premium plan). This is a bundled subscription that includes:\n * NotebookLM Pro: 500 notebooks (vs. 100), 300 sources per notebook (vs. 50), and 20 Audio Overviews per day (vs. 3).\n * Gemini Advanced: Access to Google’s most capable models (currently Gemini 3 Pro).\n * AI in Workspace: The ability to use Gemini directly inside Google Docs, Gmail, and Slides.\n * 2 TB of Storage: Expanded Google One storage for your Photos, Drive, and Gmail.\n3. Can you skip the subscription?\nIf you only need NotebookLM for basic research, you do not have to pay. You should be able to dismiss the \"Join Google AI Pro\" prompt and continue using the free version. The prompt usually appears because Google is pushing the \"Pro\" features (like higher usage limits and the new \"Deep Research\" mode) to frequent users.\nSummary Table: Free vs. Pro (as of Jan 2026)\n| Feature | Free Tier | Google AI Pro ($26.99 CAD) |\n|---|---|---|\n| Notebooks | 100 | 500 |\n| Sources per Notebook | 50 | 300 |\n| Daily Audio Overviews | 3 | 20 |\n| Daily Chat Queries | 50 | 500 |\n| Extra Benefits | None | 2TB Storage, Gemini in Docs/Gmail |\nWould you like me to help you find the specific settings to manage or cancel that subscription prompt, or are you looking for a comparison with other research tools?",
