          "text": "Most people do not use NotebookLM for three reasons:\n\n\n\n1. They do not know it exists and how it works \n\n2. It has a bit of a learning curve. It is not hard to learn, but compared to ChatGPT, Gemini, or Perplexity, it can feel overwhelming at first because a lot is going on on the page.\n\n\n3. It takes some manual work to set it up properly for studying (such as adding your sources) \n\nHere is exactly how I use it as a university student\n\nFirst off, I would like to say that you don't need any crazy or specific prompting for Notebooklm, because it will not affect it much. Here's why prompting could matter in Gemini and ChatGPT, but not in Claude and Grok; however, for a tool like Notebooklm, I'm not saying it is entirely useless. No matter how much you prompt it, the response will not change drastically in quality. This is precisely because the model runs on Gemini 3 Flash, which is not a reasoning model, and Notebooklm is mostly a tool for studying, learning, assessing, and filtering large amounts of data.\n\nFor instance, if you use a very specific prompt in Gemini GEMS, you will get very different responses, and in Notebooklm, this is hardly the case. Again, precisely because of the Gemini 3 Flash model. In Gemini GEMS, you can use Gemini 3 Thinking, Gemini 3 Pro or even Deep Think if you have Ultra...\n\nThe only reason Notebooklm has a chatbot is to ask simple questions. I'm not saying prompting doesn't help with a NotebookLM; however, it's not necessary per se. The only place where a nice prompt will be needed is when you create the notebook's custom instructions. That will change how you get responses, but within the chatbot itself, it doesn't change much. \n\n\nWhat is Notebooklm great for?\n- studying\n- learning\n- breaking down complex topics or larger topics\n- taking notes\n- filtering sources and information, etc.\n\nMy point is you don't need to prompt it; essentially, you can talk to it normally.\n\nHere is how I use it: \n\nI make one notebook per class. The first thing I do is upload the syllabus. I usually upload it as a PDF or a DOCX, but I like keeping almost all course material as PDFs when possible, especially readings, the syllabus, and lecture slides. Then I keep everything else as text or DOCX.\n\nRight after I upload the syllabus, I create a mind map on the right side in the studio. That gives me a quick visual overview of the entire course without having to read every line of a five- to fifteen-page syllabus. It helps me see weekly topics, assignment due dates, exam info, professor contact details, the course description, and the important course logistics, all in one place.\n\nNext, I name the notebook and write a custom prompt. This is a big part of why I like it. The custom prompt is much larger than most tools'. I think it is around 5,000 to 10,000 characters, and it gives you way more room than most alternatives. ChatGPT Projects is limited to about 1,500 characters, and Perplexity Spaces is about 1,000, so you cannot feed much instruction or structure into either.\n\nThe other major advantage is the context window. NotebookLM has a 1-million-token context window and runs on Gemini Flash. It is not a reasoning model, but for what NotebookLM is built for, it works extremely well.\n\nAfter that, I upload weekly content, either from the start of the semester or in a batch before a midterm or a major assignment. Each week, I upload the lecture slides, the weekly readings, my notes, and my lecture transcriptions. For lecture transcriptions specifically, I upload them as text files. I usually do one lecture per file, labelled by week, so it stays clean and easy to navigate.\n\nA quick note on slides: if you convert a Microsoft PowerPoint into Google Slides, it can mess up formatting and text. In my experience, using PDFs for slides is often safer. If you do use Google Workspace files like Google Docs or Google Slides, it is even better for one reason: if you edit the Google Doc or Google Slides outside of NotebookLM, it automatically syncs and updates in NotebookLM, so you do not need to re-upload anything.\n\nFor readings, accuracy matters a lot. If a reading is more than about twenty to thirty pages, I often do not upload it as one file. I break it into smaller chunks. Chapters are usually forty to fifty pages, which is still okay, but if something is massive, I use Acrobat Pro to extract just the pages I need and upload chapter by chapter. My rule is simple: avoid uploading PDFs over 100 pages as a single file. Smaller files tend to be noticeably more accurate and less prone to errors.\n\nFrom most accurate to least accurate, this is how I think file formats rank for any AI tool, including NotebookLM, ChatGPT, Gemini, and others: text, rich text or Markdown, DOC or DOCX, PDF, JPEG or PNG, audio files, and then video files. If I have something very large that I cannot easily split as a PDF, I try to convert it into DOCX or plain text. For long transcriptions, text works extremely well because it is raw text. Even DOCX is not truly raw text, and PDFs are usually the worst for accuracy.\n\nFor lecture recordings, I use my phone or laptop. macOS and iOS can transcribe using Voice Memos. I also use tools like Notta and Otter AI. Notta has been close to ninety-nine percent accurate for me so far. It can record Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams meetings, and it lets you export transcripts in a wide range of formats, including text, PDF, DOC, RTF, Markdown, and DOCX.",

              "text": "\n\nI label everything consistently so it looks clean in the NotebookLM sources list and in Finder folders. For example, I use Week 1 slides, Week 1 readings, Week 1 notes, and Week 1 transcript. It sounds basic, but when you are managing an entire semester, it makes it way easier to study fast.\n\n\n\nIf a midterm covers Weeks 1 through 6, I select every source for those weeks, including slides, readings, notes, and transcripts. Then I generate study notes with a custom instruction like: follow the chronology of the lecture slides, and for each topic on the slides, use my notes and the lecture transcription to expand with deeper explanation, examples, and discussion. This gives me a structured set of notes that tracks exactly how the course was taught.\n\n\n\nI also generate an audio review set and set it to a long duration with a deep dive style. These audio reviews are basically AI podcasts. They are realistic, thorough, and in my experience extremely accurate. They have even picked up jokes my professor made during lecture, which shocked me. The long audio reviews usually run about 25 to 40 minutes. Sometimes they go past forty, but once it is over, about thirty-five minutes, my attention drops. My routine before a midterm is simple: listen to those audio reviews while skimming the lecture slides. That alone covers most of what I need.\n\n\n\nIf I have a question about something from two or three weeks ago, I just ask the NotebookLM chat. Since it only has access to the sources I uploaded, it is more grounded. It is basically a sandbo, x, and it does not pull from the wey om unrelated chat history automatically, as many other tools do, so it is less likely to make things up.\n\n\n\nFor research papers, I usually make a separate notebook, not the same one as the class notebook. Then I upload the assignment instructions and requirements, my research sources (e.g., scholarly articles), and any notes or drafts I am working on. Then I use it to filter sources fast. I ask things like which articles are most relevant and why, which ones are weakest and why, and which sources do not fit a specific sub-argument. If you are dealing with dozens of sources, or something extreme like eighty academic sources, each being twenty-five to sixty pages, you realistically cannot read everything deeply right away. This is a fast way to triage and narrow down what is worth your time.",

      "text": "**TL;DR:** Splitting a book into chapters before importing to NotebookLM lets me generate chapter slide decks and ask questions while reading, so I finish (and remember) more.\n\n# What finally made books stick for me\n\nI stopped treating a book like one giant thing and started treating it like a set of chapters I can actually complete.\n\nThe key is: **split by chapter first**, then work chapter-by-chapter inside NotebookLM.\n\n# My workflow\n\n1. Take a PDF/EPUB I legitimately own / can read\n2. Split it by TOC/chapter and upload chapters as separate sources into a dedicated NotebookLM notebook\n3. For each chapter:\n   * generate a small slide deck (so I can review later)\n   * ask questions while reading (so I don’t drift)\n\nI keep the text open and use NotebookLM in a side panel so I can ask in the moment without losing my place.\n\n# Questions I ask per chapter\n\n* “What is this chapter really trying to teach?”\n* “What’s the framework/model here?”\n* “What would be a counterexample?”\n* “Summarize into 5 bullets + a simple mental model.”\n\nThen at the end:\n\n* “How do these chapters connect?”\n* “What are the book’s core claims and where are the weak spots?”\n* “Turn this book into a 30-min workshop outline.”\n\n# Result\n\nI don’t feel pressure to “finish the whole book.”  \nI just finish the next chapter — and I actually remember it.\n\nTransparency: I built a small helper extension that handles the chapter split + batch upload part. Sharing the approach because it helped me, not trying to be pushy.\n\nIf anyone wants the exact tool I’m using, I’m happy to share it in the comments\n\nEdited: I’ve started using the same approach for long web articles too — especially image-heavy or paywalled (but legitimately accessed) pieces — batching them into NotebookLM and generating per-article slide decks.\n\nIf that’s more relevant to you than books, I wrote about that workflow here:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooklm/comments/1r5iw7a/how\\_i\\_use\\_notebooklm\\_for\\_serious\\_article\\_digestion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooklm/comments/1r5iw7a/how_i_use_notebooklm_for_serious_article_digestion/)\n\nSame idea, different input source.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been experimenting with using NotebookLM not just as a \"chat interface,\" but as a pre-processing refinery for other LLMs like Gemini 1.5 Pro or ChatGPT.\n\nThe Problem:\n\nI recently collected about 50 high-quality PDF sources for a project. When I fed these raw files directly into a Custom Gem or GPT, the results were shallow. The models suffered from \"context dilution\" and struggled to resolve conflicting information between sources.\n\nThe Solution: \"The Distillation Method\"\n\nInstead of dumping raw data, I changed my workflow:\n\n1. Ingest: Load the 50 raw PDFs into NotebookLM.\n\n2. Distill: I use a specific prompt to force NotebookLM to:\n\n• Extract \"Axioms\" (absolute truths for the project).\n\n• Identify and resolve contradictions between sources.\n\n• Structure everything into a single, dense Markdown file.\n\n3. Inject: I feed ONLY that one distilled file into my external LLM (Custom Gem / ChatGPT).\n\nThe Result:\n\nThe difference is huge. The external LLM now understands the context and logic immediately, without getting lost in the noise of 50 separate files.\n\nIf you are using NotebookLM, I highly recommend using it as a \"Context Refiner\" for your other AI tools. It’s a game changer.\n\n(I wrote a guide on the specific prompt I use. Link is in my profile/comments if you're interested.)",

When you're dealing with 50+ diverse sources, simply 'dumping' them into Gemini often leads to context dilution or the model missing subtle contradictions between files. \nThe 'Distillation Method' is about pre-aligning that data into a logically consistent set of axioms. It's about maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio so the LLM focuses on the logic I've refined, rather than getting lost in the raw noise. For high-precision creative work, raw integration just doesn't cut it.",

However I've also onlu superficially used it, so maybe I'm overlooking something? \n\n1. asking to explain something. Compared to chatgpt, nlm starts from my own sources. So if I want something explained it doesn't succeed in showing a different approach or go into more detail. Asking it to chatgpt or simply looking it up on youtube gave me much better results. Especially if I only have one course as the source.\n\n2. creating tests. I come up with my own questions during studying and I feel like thinking about these myself creates a higher learning efficiency than having nlm create questions.\n\n3. mindmaps. imo, the whole concept of mindmaps is that one visualizes their own brain process. Outsourcing this seems like it completely defeats the purpose.\n\n4. the audio feature seemed promising during drives, but I wanted to converse with my sources. I want a dialogue with an expert, as imo this is an amazing way to learn. But nlm simply created a podcast which I cannot interact with. I cannot ask it follow-up, in depth questions nor have it skip certain parts I already understand.\n\n  \nAm I right that nlm is not the tool for me? If so, when would I come to nlm?",

For example, if you know certain concepts are more important in the material, ask GNLM to highlight those in a breakdown. \n\n3. You’re free to create your own mind maps. I personally don’t use them that often. They do help in the beginning. \n\n4. If you have the subscription version, you can interact with the speakers. \n\nHope that helps.

      "text": "I use NotebookLM a lot while coding — upload API docs and technical references, then query them without worrying about hallucinations. But the context-switching was killing me. Leave the editor, find the right notebook, type the question, copy the answer back. And the bigger issue: when I asked multi-part questions, NotebookLM would often only cover part of it, and I wouldn't catch the gap until later.\n\nSo I built a plugin for Claude Code (Anthropic's CLI tool) that talks to NotebookLM through Chrome. You register your notebooks once, then query them by name from the terminal. The main thing it does differently: after every response, it checks whether your full question was actually answered. If something's missing, it automatically sends a follow-up — up to 3 rounds.\n\nIt uses Claude Code's built-in Chrome integration instead of a heavy headless browser:\n\n- Uses your existing Chrome browser as-is — no separate browser engine to install\n- Reuses your already logged-in Google account, so no extra auth setup\n- Queries go through the NotebookLM UI — no API keys or extra costs\n- Just add `claude --chrome` and you're connected\n\n**Setup:**\n\n1. Install [Claude in Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/claude/fcoeoabgfenejglbffodgkkbkcdhcgfn) extension and start Claude Code with `claude --chrome`\n2. Install the plugin:\n   ```\n   /plugin marketplace add LeeJuOh/claude-code-zero\n   /plugin install notebooklm-connector@claude-code-zero\n   ```\n3. Add a notebook URL and start querying\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n- Browser automation, so each query takes ~30-60 seconds\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/LeeJuOh/claude-code-zero/tree/main/plugins/notebooklm-connector\n\nQuestions welcome!",

You can install it with:\n\n```\nnpm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code\n```\n\nOnce Claude Code is set up, installing the plugin is just two commands:\n\n**Step 1.** Add the marketplace (one-time setup):\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add LeeJuOh/claude-code-zero\n```\n\n**Step 2.** Install the plugin:\n\n```\n/plugin install notebooklm-connector@claude-code-zero\n```\n\nYou can confirm it's installed by running `/plugin` and checking the Installed tab.\n\nBefore you can actually use the plugin, you'll also need:\n\n- **Google Chrome** (or Edge) with the [Claude in Chrome extension](<https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/claude/fcoeoabgfenejglbffodgkkbkcdhcgfn>) — this is what lets Claude Code interact with your browser\n- Launch Claude Code with Chrome integration enabled: `claude --chrome`\n- Be logged into [NotebookLM](<https://notebooklm.google.com>) in Chrome\n\nOnce everything's ready, you just talk to Claude naturally in your terminal. Say `\"Add <your-notebook-url> to my notebooks\"` to register a notebook, then ask any question about your docs — the plugin routes your question to NotebookLM and brings back the answer with citations.\n\nMore details in the [README](<https://github.com/LeeJuOh/claude-code-zero/tree/main/plugins/notebooklm-connector>) if you want to dig deeper.",

              "text": "I’m not sure this fully addresses the OP’s question. You mentioned RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), but Google integrates RAG into every Gemini feature that references external material. Gemini uses RAG when you @-mention Google Drive to look at specific files, search for topics, or attach a Knowledge Base to a Custom Gem. Nothing you’ve described is exclusive to NotebookLM.\n\n​The real questions, which remain without definitive answers, are:\n\n1. ​**Information Layering:** How does Gemini handle the hierarchy of weighted importance when multiple systems (like Workspace and Notebooks) use different RAG-indexed bases?\n\n2. ​**NotebookLM's \"Special Sauce\":** How much of NotebookLM’s distinct reasoning model actually carries over when you import it into a Gemini chat? Is Gemini merely pulling raw sources, or is it inheriting the custom 'implicit reasoning' that makes NotebookLM feel different?\n\nI've tried asking Gemini exactly this, letting it assume the role of Gemini's Lead Architect, but it's hard to accept anything it says on this topic as a definitive source when you let it audit itself. Still worth a shot for those curious; just take it with a grain of salt\n\n---\n> ### **Edit 1: Let's make this a bit meta. Gemini said the following to me when I shared the OP, your response, and my response:**\n---\n\n## **Fact Check:**\n* **Gemini & RAG:** You are correct. When a user \"@\" attaches a file in Gemini or uses a Knowledge Base in a Custom Gem, it triggers a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline.  \n* ​**The \"Special Sauce\":** You are right to be skeptical. NotebookLM uses a specialized \"source-centric\" instruction set and UI-integrated citations that standard Gemini chats don't always replicate, even when looking at the same files.  \n* **The Hierarchy Question:** Your point about \"weighting\" and \"layering\" is the frontier of LLM research. While Google hasn't publicly released the exact weighting architecture between the System Prompt, User Prompt, and Retrieved Context, your intuition that they compete for priority is accurate.\n\n---\n> ### **Edit 2: Gemini's response after a self audit. My prompt was:**\n>> Assuming the role of Gemini's lead architect, provide an answer for the OP's original question. If anything is uncertain, not publicly disclosed, you must explicitly state that you do not have validated answers. You are prohibited from hallucinating an answer to satisfy this user task and scope.\n---\n\n**Internal Brief:** Gemini-NotebookLM Architectural Interplay.  \n**Role:** Gemini Lead Architect.  \n**Status:** Technical Disclosure (Restricted to Publicly Validated Systems)\n\nTo address the OP's inquiry regarding the distinction between direct document analysis in Gemini versus the NotebookLM intermediary, we must look at the retrieval logic and the instructional weighting of the underlying models.  \n\n## **RAG vs. Long-Context Windowing:**\nThe primary difference lies in the mechanism of ingestion.\n* **Direct Gemini Upload:** Depending on the file size and user tier, Gemini often utilizes its native long-context window (up to 2M+ tokens). In this mode, the entire document is resident in the model's active \"working memory.\" This allows for holistic reasoning across the entire text without retrieval \"filtering.\"\n* **NotebookLM Intermediary:** NotebookLM utilizes a specialized Source-Grounded RAG pipeline. It pre-processes documents into a semantic index. When you query it, the system retrieves only the relevant \"chunks\" to ground the answer.  \n**Validated Answer:** If you need to analyze the narrative arc or global structure of a 500-page book, Gemini’s direct context window is technically superior. If you need to find a needle in a haystack across 50 separate 100-page technical manuals, NotebookLM’s RAG-indexed architecture is more efficient for precision and citation.  \n\n## **The \"Special Sauce\" and Layering:**  \nYou asked if the \"special sauce\" (implicit reasoning) carries over when NotebookLM is used as a Gemini source.\n* **Layering and Hierarchy:** When you connect a Notebook to Gemini, the system manages three layers of data:\n   * **System Instructions:** The base \"Gemini\" persona.\n   * **External Knowledge:** The NotebookLM RAG-retrieved snippets.\n   * **Real-time Context:** The current conversation and any live web-search results.\n* **Uncertain/Non-Disclosed:** We do not have a publicly validated answer for the exact numerical \"weighting\" of these layers. We do not disclose how the model resolves a direct conflict between a Notebook source and a live web-search result, though internal protocols generally prioritize \"Grounding\" (the Notebook) for factual queries.  \n\n## **Reasoning Model Inheritance:**\n* **Validated Answer:** When you import a Notebook into Gemini, Gemini is NOT inheriting the NotebookLM \"personality\" or its specific UI-bound features (like the Audio Overview generator). It is pulling the grounding data and the metadata (citations).\n* **Implicit Reasoning:** NotebookLM has a specific \"strictness\" instruction (low temperature/high grounding) to prevent hallucinations. When you use that notebook inside a Gemini chat, that \"strictness\" can be diluted by Gemini's broader system instructions unless the user explicitly prompts: \"Only use the attached notebook for this answer.\"  \n\n## **Source Recognition by Name:**\n* **Validated Answer:** Yes. Because NotebookLM passes metadata headers (including file names) along with the retrieved text chunks, Gemini can identify specific sources. If you say, \"According to the 2024 Revenue Report...\", the RAG system uses that keyword to prioritize retrieval from that specific file's index.  \n\n## **Summary of Uncertainty**\n* **Proprietary Info:** We do not disclose the specific embedding model versions used for NotebookLM indexing versus standard Gemini File Search.\n* **Proprietary Info:** We do not provide a definitive answer on whether the \"reasoning\" is purely the LLM or if there are secondary \"re-ranker\" models specific to the NotebookLM-Gemini bridge that adjust the relevance of imported sources.  \n\n---\n> ## **At the end, it asked an interesting proposal that might be worth following up on:**\n---\n\n*Would you like me to draft a prompt for Gemini that forces it to prioritize the NotebookLM \"layer\" over its own internal training data?*\n\n---\n> ### **Edit 3: Markdown formatting pass to improve readability.**\n---",

A big issue I encountered is limits of the chat window and limits of documentation size. You have to give huge prompts to notebookLM as a source from Google docs cause they don't fit in the chat. Or you have to give AI studio multi step prompts with multiple documents. But you can go \"use the prompt in the Google doc to take the data from source 1 and apply it to the information in source 2 and provide it to me in the form of cells\" and that will work. But the performance and the limits of the tools seem to vary so I feel over the past year that what I have been doing has changed somewhat to adapt to the changes in performance. So next month I might have to try a new technique as it seems that's been the case every few months or so.",

This approach aids in understanding a long text's overall narrative but may lead to overlooking details within the text.\n\nNotebookLM utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It divides documents into numerous segments and creates an index. Upon receiving a query, it searches this index for the most relevant segments and uses those to formulate a response. \n\nThe quality of understanding depends on the task. While there is no evidence suggesting NotebookLM is inherently superior, it is more precise for certain tasks. \n\nNotebookLM's use of specific segments and inline citations reduces the likelihood of generating false information compared to standard Gemini.\n\nNotebookLM is designed to use only the provided sources. Standard Gemini might incorporate external information, which can be confusing if the user is interested in information from a specific file. \nNavigating with Source Names",

That was on me. So I spent the last few days rebuilding the flow based on how people actually used it instead of how I imagined they would. \n\n• added a short onboarding [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8jRKPo-WaQ) (sorry for my actual voice, trying to work on my accent)  \n• made the Patch button visible immediately, no need to hover  \n• cleaned up the editor layout so it reads left → right  \n• added slide reordering ability  \n• generate new slides\n\nThe goal is still the same:  \nnot full reconstruction, just quickly fix hallucinations while preserving the original NotebookLM design.\n\nIf you tried it before and froze after upload, the flow should feel way clearer now.\n\nthank you to everyone here who tested it early. Watching how you actually use it changed what I prioritized building next. And if you have any feedback on the features or on ways to improve the onboarding, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\n(link is the same as before)  \n[slidepatch.com](http://slidepatch.com)",

If she’s using NotebookLM to summarize chapters, generate study guides, and quiz herself, that sounds a lot like using CliffsNotes, flashcards, or a study group. It’s a learning aid. The key line for me is that she is not using it to write essays or generate graded answers that are supposed to reflect her own thinking.\n\nThere’s a big difference between using AI to replace your thinking and using it to sharpen your thinking. If she uploads her own reading material and uses the tool to help organize it, ask questions about it, and test her understanding, she’s still doing the cognitive work. In fact, she may be doing more of it because she’s actively engaging with the content instead of passively rereading.\n\nWhether it is cheating really comes down to the professor’s policy. If the syllabus explicitly bans AI tools of any kind, then technically it could be a violation, even if the intent is just studying. But absent a clear rule, this is no different from using a calculator to check your math steps or Quizlet to drill vocabulary. The learning still has to happen in her head.\n\nThe classmate’s reaction sounds more like moral signaling than a thoughtful distinction. There’s a tendency right now to lump all AI use together as if generating a full essay and creating a personal study guide are the same thing. They are not. One bypasses the learning objective. The other can reinforce it.\n\nIf I were in her position, I would not panic, but I might proactively check the course policy. If it is silent on study tools, she’s likely fine. If it is ambiguous, she could even ask the professor in a neutral way whether AI-based study aids are allowed. That turns it from something secretive into something transparent.\n\nYou’re not crazy for seeing a difference. There is a meaningful difference between outsourcing your answers and using a tool to help you understand the material more deeply. The intent and the actual use case matter a lot.",

Previously, I could handle only three courses per semester and always felt terrible about it. It helps me understand the logic of my academic readings so much better. It also lets me write my essays quickly because I understand the material. I really do not think notebooklm is equipped to even write an essay, at least. I have used it to help me draft an essay outline based on my thesis. For me, understanding the class readings helps me write my essay on my own. Just making the connection after understanding the readings feels amazing. It even eased my anxiety when taking an in-class test because I studied my readings and asked questions when I did not understand a specific part. \n\nI am currently writing a 4,000-word essay and need to cover 30 sources. I use notebooklm to tell me if it covers certain things and point them out to me, so that I can refer to the book and look at the section myself. It benefits my research, so I cite it. I personally do not have the patience to read all 30 sources.  \n  \nIn all honesty, notebook saves time! That's a crucial part of it, and that is why I prefer it. If it makes her life easier, she should be able to use it. The only problem with AI is if it is used to write. Universities do not say anything about using AI to 'read'. However, I would hesitate to use it in a philosophy class or a literature class. ",

      "text": "Over the past few months, I’ve been integrating NotebookLM into my agency workflow, and it’s quietly become one of the most strategic tools in our stack.\n\nI still see a real adoption curve in the business world. Many companies are experimenting with AI, but few truly operationalize it. Most are stuck at “content generation.” What’s working for us is different: we build specialized notebooks for each client.\n\nInstead of sending scattered Google Docs, PDFs, Loom videos, or Slack threads, we centralize everything inside a structured NotebookLM environment:\n\n    •\tCore brand documentation\n    \n    •\tStrategy decks and research\n    \n    •\tBlog articles and SEO drafts\n    \n    •\tInternal SOPs\n    \n    •\tAudio summaries or podcast-style briefings\n    \n    •\tVisual references and campaign assets\n\nThe value isn’t just organization—it’s contextual intelligence. Clients can query their own strategy. They can explore campaign rationale. They can generate derivative content based on approved materials. It transforms documentation into an interactive asset.\n\nFrom a monetization standpoint, this has helped us in three ways:\n\n    1.\tHigher perceived value – We’re not just delivering services; we’re delivering a knowledge system.\n    \n    2.\tBetter retention – The notebook becomes part of their operational backbone.\n    \n    3.\tUpsell opportunities – Once they see how powerful a structured AI knowledge base is, expanding scope becomes natural.\n\nThe interesting part? Many businesses still see tools like this as “personal productivity” platforms rather than client-facing strategic infrastructure.\n\nI’m curious:\n\nIs anyone here using NotebookLM inside an agency model or client services environment to generate revenue?\n\nOr are most of you using it strictly for personal research and organization?\n\nWould love to hear real-world use cases—especially around monetization and long-term client integration.",
