Pick a niche related to your product or service and write content your ideal customer is already searching for.\n\nNext step is choosing the platform. WordPress is still the safest choice because you own your content and can scale SEO long term. Do not overthink themes or plugins at the beginning. A fast site with clean design matters more than fancy layouts.\n\nContent wise, focus on quality over volume. One helpful post per week that answers real questions will beat ten AI generated posts. Use basic SEO like proper titles, internal links, and clear structure, but write for humans first.\n\nPromotion comes last. Share posts where your audience already hangs out like Reddit, Twitter, or niche communities. Blogging still works in 2026, but only if you treat it as a long term asset, not a quick traffic hack.",

To be honest, SEO is largely dead for new players because the landscape is oversaturated with AI-generated content, making it nearly impossible to rank. My advice is to build your brand where the attention already is, social networks provide immediate reach and engagement, while a private blog, unfortunately, will likely be ignored by everyone but you.",

Basic SEO matters, but distribution matters more. Most blogs fail because no one ever sees the content.\n\nHonestly, I’d strongly suggest starting a YouTube channel alongside it, or even before the blog. Video builds trust much faster, people connect with a face, and YouTube is still a massive search engine. You can always repurpose videos into blog posts, social content, and emails later.\n\nIn 2026, blogs are better for authority and long-term search, while video is better for visibility and trust.

I'm a founder too and struggled with starting content from zero, clueless about traction; took me months to find a rhythm. Try focusing on niche, problem-first posts that answer specific questions so SEO and trust build naturally, and document the founder journey to create unique, reusable content that feeds newsletters and social. I built SignalScouter to find Reddit threads where users ask for solutions and generate founder-style replies, which helped get 89 signups in 2 days and 10k+ views; would love feedback or to connect if you try it, it could help jumpstart organic traffic from day one.

I quitted my job a little over year ago with another cofounder. But after one unsuccessful pivot, my cofounder decided to leave. But I still don't want to give up yet. So here I am looking for similar minded folks!\n\nWhat I can offer as a cofounder:\n\n1. Technical skills. I was a ML scientist for Amazon and have a PhD in computational math before starting the adventure. So I have a solid foundation for coding (mostly backend). In my previous startup, me and my cofounder created two AI-based softwares from ground up and get some sales.\n2. Customer development. I am also the one who is doing all the cold outreach, customer interviews and help refine the product vision and refine the ICP\n3. Persistence and commitment. I like to invest in relationship. So if I decide to work with you, you don't have to worry I give up easily.\n4. Domain expertise in some area. Especially in education, tech, and finance (passed CFA II). So we can discuss some startup ideas in this area if you are interested. But I am open to other ideas\n\nWhat I want my cofounders to bring to the table\n\n1. Must be in Seattle area and willing to meet 3-4 times in person a week. I want to build a real relationship with my cofounders\n2. Must be already full time. Not against who is doing side hustles. Just based on my personal experience. I had tried to start a business with some one who only did the startup as a side hustle. It was a terrible mistake and invited a lot of frustrations and grudge against each other which I want to avoid again\n3. No specific preference for technical or nontechnical. But if you are non-technical, hope you are domain expert in the area that you want to start a startup in. My past year told me that founder-market fit is crucial.\n\nAgain thanks for reading and please feel free to DM me if you are interested!",

Once that became clear, things started moving much faster for us. We’ve been using AI mainly to remove friction, not add complexity. AI helps us filter resumes that best match the job role, we also use AI-based interviews to help recruiters evaluate candidates early.  That said, we don’t fully rely on AI. There is always human involvement to apply judgment, context, and experience. AI helps speed things up, but humans make the final calls.\n\nFor us, clarity of problem + simple use of AI (not over-engineering it) made the biggest difference.

In areas like e-commerce, getting something off the ground feels significantly cheaper than it used to be. A basic product or store can now be launched much faster, with far less upfront effort and fewer people involved.\n\nWhat I’m unsure about is whether the cost actually disappeared or simply moved. If development and initial setup are no longer the main barriers, it feels like the real challenges now show up elsewhere. Traffic acquisition, distribution, branding, and supply chain decisions seem to matter more than ever, and they often end up costing far more than the product itself.\n\nOnly later did I start looking into AI-driven platforms that bundle a lot of this early work together, like Genstore and similar tools. They clearly lower the technical barrier, but they also make me wonder if the playing field is now flatter than before.",

Advertising is crucial. For example, suppose 10 people created the same product, which is easy to do with AI, say, a booking clone. Who will be successful? Not the one who posts a lot on social media or does other things. Someone who bought a lot of advertising, drove 1,000,000 people to the site, and 1,000 remain, and this happens every day. I look at successful AI-powered projects, they generate 50 creative ads a month and spend a lot of money on advertising. And I see projects of the same quality or even better nearby, but which have no users because they advertise on social networks through posts (for free) or through dead SEO =)",

A lot of luck is involved but I think it comes down to two additional pieces. \n\nNumber one, confidence. Where skill is lacking, confidence never can be. Confidence is king, sells more than any individual skill I've ever seen. On my first deal, I had virtually zero skill, but worked hard and was confident. And the deal closed. \n\nSecond, energy. Sales is a transfer of energy, nothing more nothing less. If your energy is off, the customer feels that and backs off and you will sell a fraction of what you could with solid energy. Always check your vibes and energy. \n\nEnergy, confidence, and yes a great amount of luck led me to my first deal nearly 10 years ago.",

Although the process went through two rounds of back-and-forth, I eventually closed the deal in less than a week. At the time, I attributed the success largely to luck.\n\nHowever, my partners later pointed out that this was only how it appeared on the surface. In reality, I had put in a great deal of effort at every stage and paid attention to many small details. It was precisely the accumulation of these efforts that led to the final, decisive result.\n\nWhen it came to closing my second deal, however, the client was lost. Although the root cause was that the client’s budget was insufficient, I also became aware that I was much more afraid of losing the deal than I had been the first time. I believe this mindset, to some extent, affected my negotiations with the client.\n\nTherefore, I’ve come to realize that whether it is luck or hard work, maintaining a healthy and steady mindset is extremely important. In addition, true growth comes from continuously learning and accumulating experience through repeated practice in every situation.",

If you don't have clarity on your process, or if it is not good, than a specific tool will not solve any problem.\n\nOverlooking the process and focusing on the tools is the biggest mistake for both IT professionals and those who hire them.\n\nEvery tool has it's downsides and every software is flawed. But more often than not, when you fail at a project, the problem is not on the tool or the platform you're using, but on lack of planning and proper management.\n\n* Automating your sales process is useless without having a great offer\n* Launching a paid traffic campaign is a waste of money if you don't know where your potential clients are and how to talk to them\n* A fancy landingpage will not bring you any results without a clear communication and a great CTA\n* Implementing a CRM won't do anything for you if you don't know how to analyse data and get feedback on your clients in order to continuously improve your process at each new one\n\nAI is changing the game, lowering the barriers for people to start their businesses and giving eveyone who dominate and keep up with the changes an unfair advantage over those who don't.

Buying software is concrete and fast, figuring out who your customer is and what actually converts is slow.

Since I’m a developer, I made a simple interface combining AI chat and image generation.\n\nThe first version took less than two weeks. Over the last six months, we added chat with PDFs, mindmaps, video generation, and new AI models.\n\nWe sponsored 50 YouTube creators, including 10 Indian creators. In the last 3 months, we sponsored 5 Indian creators. Today the product has over 300K users.\n\nOne Indian YouTuber we paid $400 for a dedicated video got 43K views, 7K visits, 3K free signups, and only 1 paying user. This showed that not every audience converts, and Indian viewers in particular rarely become paying users.\n\nWestern creators and some from UAE and Spain convert much better. Now we focus on mid to big-tier influencers who can go viral and bring real engagement.\n\nNot all traffic is equal. Views feel good, but paying users keep the product alive. Investing in creators whose audiences genuinely care is far more valuable than chasing free signups.\n\nAsk me anything about how we grew it, what strategies worked, what failed, and how we decide which creators to sponsor next.",

A lot of founders I know aren’t based in NYC, and I’ve personally found it hard to build real, in-person relationships with people who are dealing with the same day-to-day challenges.\n\nI know there are plenty of groups out there. I’ve tried a few. Most end up being networking-heavy, centered around talks, or have high barriers to entry. I like the concept of Hampton, but I’m interested in something similar for people who haven’t hit the $X+M/year revenue mark yet.\n\nI’m looking to start a small, in-person group in NYC that meets once a month for coffee or dinner. The goal is simple: a chill, intimate space to vent, sanity-check ideas, and talk honestly about what’s working and what isn’t. Very much like this subreddit, but in real life. No pitching. No selling to each other.\n\nRequirements are intentionally minimal:\n\n* You’re working on something full time\n* You’re based in NYC and can meet in person\n\nYou don’t need funding, a fancy background, or credentials. Just an understanding of the grind and a genuine interest in building real connections.\n\nI’m aiming to do the first meetup in the second half of this month. If you’re interested, DM me and think of at least one other person you’d want to bring along.",

If I can, I’ll ask you to DM me the file you want enriched. If I say I can but then can’t produce what you asked for, I will send you $2.\n\n* Those $2 will be sent to you via Venmo, PayPal or Zelle (only).\n\n* If you are requesting special variables things such as emails, I will provide just a few to my own discretion (it’s expensive after all and I’m giving it for free).\n\n* I will enrich just a small portion of your file (if it’s big) to save on time as im sure I’ll get a lot of requests. \n\nWe’ll define a successful enrichment as a file that includes the variables we agreed upon before taking on the bet. \n\nLet the experiment begin!

But I'm a developer, and I wanted something specific that I couldn't find:\n\n**An app that tells me \"you're doing fine\" instead of just showing me charts.**\n\n73% of millennial dads report parenting anxiety. I'm one of them. Every app showed me data but none of them helped with the \"am I screwing this up?\" feeling.\n\nSo I built Dad Co-Pilot. The main things that make it different:\n\n* \"Is this normal?\" insights based on CDC/AAP guidelines. Not just \"5 feeds today\" but \"5 feeds today—that's right on track for this age.\"\n* Mental health breaks built in. Breathing exercises, stretches for baby-carrying tension, and a daily dad joke because sometimes you just need to laugh.\n* Partner sync without leaderboards or competition. Just \"last feed was 2 hours ago.\"\n\nIt's free to download. There's a premium tier, but the core tracking is free.\n\nIf you try it, I'd genuinely love feedback. What's missing? What's annoying? What would make it actually useful for you?\n\nLet me know in comments, i'll send the link from app store, thank you.",

It’s mobile-first, fast logging, and tries to be actually useful when you need to talk to a doctor (reports, trends, patterns). The whole idea is: less \"health app fluff\", more \"I can capture what happened in 20 seconds, then understand it later\".\n\nNow the funny part: it’s… non-profit. Like *actually* non-profit. Not \"non-profit\" as in \"we lose money for 18 months and call it a strategy\". More like: I’m paying for it, I’m building it, there are no ads, no paywalls, and I’m not trying to turn migraine sufferers into an LTV spreadsheet. So yes, this might be the first truly non-profit startup in history and I’m sure YC will reject me for insufficient greed 😄\n\nWhy I’m posting: I’m looking for brutally honest feedback from builders. What would you expect from a product like this? What would make you trust it (especially around privacy)? And if you’ve ever built something “health-adjacent”, what mistakes should I avoid before it grows?\n\nIf you want to peek: [migraine.club](http://migraine.club)  \nHappy to answer questions, and if you have feature requests, I’ll probably implement them because I clearly enjoy suffering twice.",

Some countries have very specific rules around what you can and can’t collect from customers. I’d look at comparable platforms, not identical ones, but close enough to be relevant, to see how they handle privacy.\n\nQuestion: when you say non-profit, are you set up as a non-profit entity from a tax perspective?\n\nHappy Holidays",

I am struggling with migraines, and I tried so many tools so far, nothing really what I liked. Hence, that why I even started. And no, I did not registered any LLC/Entity for this one, and I believe I don't need so far. Interesting part, I am already have an open chats for an integration for some doctors, and none required any legal entity, mainly HIPAA certification is needed, and thats what also we have on ours roadmap.",

      "text": "You know what almost tanked our seed round? Not our burn rate. Not our metrics. Not product-market fit.\n\nA missed compliance filing in Delaware that we didn't even know existed.\n\nWe incorporated as a C-Corp 14 months ago. Delaware because that's what everyone does, right? Hired a lawyer for formation, got our docs, moved on to building product.\n\nFast forward to due diligence with our lead investor. Their legal team comes back: \"Your franchise tax is overdue and your status shows issues in the state system.\"\n\nWe scrambled. Paid penalties. Overnighted documents. Lost two weeks of momentum during a critical fundraising window because nobody on our founding team knew Delaware has specific annual requirements beyond just federal taxes.\n\nI wish someone had told us that incorporating is the easy part. Maintaining corporate compliance while you're trying to scale is the hard part.\n\nAnnual reports. Franchise taxes. Registered agent requirements. BOI reporting. Foreign qualification if you're operating in multiple states. It's death by a thousand administrative cuts and none of it is in the \"how to start a startup\" playbooks.\n\nWe ended up hiring a registered agent to handle ongoing compliance after that \"disaster\". Should've done it from day one. The cost is negligible compared to what we almost lost.\n\nBudget for this. Put it in your financial model. It's not sexy but neither is explaining to investors why your corporate status is flagged during DD.\n\nAnyone else learn this lesson the hard way or were we just uniquely clueless?",
