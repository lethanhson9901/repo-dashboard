      "text": "I came across this breakdown and it completely flipped how I thought about YouTube. Figured it might be valuable for you as well.\n\nMost founders assume YouTube only works if you go big. Massive subscriber counts, viral videos, influencer-level reach. But this case study proves that's wrong, well at least for B2B.\n\nThere's a small company in immigration + tax optimization. Nothing sexy. Their average client pays around $2,000 though. Their YouTube channel has maybe 1,000 to 1,500 subscribers. And from that channel alone, they've booked 500+ sales calls. That's easily seven figures in revenue from what most people would call a \"dead\" channel.\n\nBut it gets crazier… They get only around 350 to 400 views per day. About 30 videos total. But they close roughly half their calls. They even spun up a second channel in another language with under 30 subscribers, and it already brought in multiple paying clients.\n\nThis is why B2B YouTube is a completely different game.\n\nSubscriber count is a vanity metric. What actually matters:\n\n* Who's watching: are they decision-makers or random browsers?\n* Why they're watching: are they actively looking for a solution?\n* How much one customer is worth: if a client pays $2k, $10k, or more, you don't need scale\n\nThe videos that drive revenue on this channel aren't flashy. They're boring, high-intent, search-driven stuff: \"how to get residency in X,\" \"best tax residency for digital nomads,\" country comparisons etc. These aren't entertainment videos. They're decision-stage videos, which means the viewer is already problem-aware and actively searching for a solution. That's why they convert.\n\nIf you're selling something where one customer is worth a few thousand dollars or more, obsessing over subscriber count makes no sense. A small channel with the right topics can outperform a larger audience watching for entertainment. The leverage comes from intent, not scale.\n\nI’d love to hear form other founders to see if you’ve had similar results? Have any of you tried YouTube as an acquisition channel? What results did you see?",

      "text": "I see a lot of posts here celebrating wins related to landing new customers, which is awesome, but you are leaving money on the table (because I sure have) if you are only optimizing and focusing on net new lands or raising prices on them.                               \n\nI've been building Answer HQ, a customer support SaaS, the past year. \n\nLast week, I asked my existing customers, who on average spend between $200-$300 a month, if they would like to add more seats to their assistant so their team doesn't need to share just one account. \n\nTo my surprise, within the first hour of me asking that question, three companies replied yes, they needed more seats. I know this sounds totally made up, but if you DM me, I can send you screenshots of the conversation. It surprised me too.                                              \n\nSo bro, I've had these larger customers for over a year now, and it turns out they all needed more seats, and I could have been making at minimum 10% more per customer. I just literally needed to ask the question. \n\nI never thought to upsell them this way. I'm a fucking idiot. \n\nI will be charging them $20/mo/seat, and it was an instant upsell that increased the revenue for all three accounts in less than an hour by 10%.                                  \n\nSo yeah. Don't just focus on net new customers. Focus on landing & expanding and upselling to existing customers. You don't need to just rely on increasing prices. The side benefit to upselling is that it helps with churn. It won't fix high churn, but it helps with the small leaks.             \n\nIf you're building a B2B SaaS, what other ways have you experimented with to increase revenue for existing customers? What value were you trying to drive? ",

Shared accounts are annoying, risky, and they quietly cap adoption, so seats is an easy yes when the team is growing.\n\nOther ways to expand in B2B support tools without feeling salesy:\n\nCharge on outcomes or usage that maps to value, like volume, channels, automations, AI assisted resolutions, knowledge base coverage.\n\nOffer add ons that reduce operational pain, onboarding help, integrations support, priority support, quarterly workflow reviews.\n\nAdd manager level features as a higher tier, reporting, QA, coaching, audit trails, because that pulls in a second buyer inside the account.\n\nUse product triggers when you detect shared logins or multiple agents, so the expansion ask feels like a natural prompt, not a cold email.\n\nWhat was the main driver for those three customers.

              "text": "My 2 cents (background: I run a B2B SaaS )\n\nWe used to charge customers for integration and onboarding, as two separate line items. We used to get a lot of push back on the integration fee but never on onboarding. \n\nI realized that's because as soon as I charge for onboarding, in teh customer's frame of reference, I now own the KPI of change management; to ensure people use the product and adopt it soon enough.\n\nWhereas when it comes to the integration free, the customer's frame of reference is that this should be part of the product; if you have an integration I should get that for free.\n\nSo what changed? Now, we offer integration for free but charge decently well for onboarding & setup, and customers pay that happily.  We get covered for the effort we put in, without losing on the perceived value.\n\nRecently, we also noticed there is significant churn in our industry and teams need to be retrained on our software (usually every 5-6 months). Earlier, retraining on our software was a casual excercise that happened internally, but no one owned it as a metric. Now that we charge for it, customers are happy to shift that KPI to us.\n\nThis ties back to your point on removing the friction component. I think customers are happy to pay, we just dont show enough value.",

We set up an automated email that fires exactly when a customer hits 80% of their monthly transaction limit.

You should analyse your database to find the exact usage threshold that signals a need for more capacity.",

About 20 years ago, I had an idea for a social media website (sorry don’t want to give too much info away) while I was college and tried to learn as much web development as I could (design and database) and after awhile I just gave up as I had no connections to anyone in the development world and just gave up. Fast forward to today, with the help of Claude and Codex and about 6 months of time, I have the site just about fully working beyond just a proof of concept. I know people always feel confident about their ideas and whatnot, but this site has potential to make money from day one and the more people use it the more money it could generate. I’m about as new to the startup world as you can get and looking for any advice I can to see how I can either find funding from investors, to perhaps try to keep going and get this idea off the ground myself? As I'm the only one navigating this path, I have so many questions but I’m finding it tough to find a course that will educate me to even ask the questions I need if that makes sense. Again my apologies for the lack of details as far as the site goes, but I'm just trying not to get burned. thank you in advance. I'm located in Boston if that help :-)",

Honestly, most first-time founders don’t get that far before giving up.\n\nAt this stage, the most important thing is just getting people to use it and seeing how they react. Even a small group of active users can prove that your idea has traction and help you figure out what works and what doesn’t. Networking is also really important. You don’t have to know everyone in tech, but meeting other founders, going to local meetups in Boston, or joining online startup communities can open doors for advice, partnerships, and eventually funding.\n\nSince you’re new to fundraising, it helps to start simple. Try putting together a one-page pitch that explains the problem you’re solving, how your product does it, who it’s for, and any traction you already have. Even if it’s just a few users, showing that people are actually using your product speaks volumes to investors. You could also consider bootstrapping at first if your site can make money early, because showing revenue makes it much easier to attract investment later.",

Execution and distribution matter more than the idea. If you cannot describe the problem and who it is for, you will struggle to get users or funding anyway.\n\nPick one tight audience in Boston and run a small closed beta. Twenty to fifty people you can personally recruit is enough to learn whether they actually come back, invite others, and use it the way you expect.\n\nDefine the one behavior that matters. For a social product it is usually a repeat action plus an invite. If you cannot get that, money will not fix it.\n\nTreat “money from day one” carefully. Ask yourself who pays, for what, and why now. You can test willingness to pay early, but you need usage first.\n\nOn funding, most investors will not fund an early social app without traction, because the risk is distribution. If you want to raise later, your job now is to show retention, growth from invites, and a clear niche you dominate.\n\nIf you want one concrete next move: write a one paragraph description of who it is for, what problem it solves, and what someone does on day one that makes them want to return. Then recruit a small beta around that and watch behavior, not opinions.",

      "text": "Haha. I haven't earned anything, but that's OK, I'm only 30 days in! Here's my story (none of this is generated, no AI for this post!).\n\nI created [RidgeText](https://ridgetext.com) as a tool for myself to use when I'm hunting. I realized that with satellite texting I could message my wife and kids to ask questions, like \"what's the weather for the next few days?\" but I couldn't really use them for everything. I hunt in an area that has spotty cell phone coverage and barely any data. My hunting spot has absolutely no coverage, so satellite texting is so valuable.\n\nI realized that I could develop an AI tool to do the Google searches for me, look up the weather, get the news, perform research tasks, analyze images, generate images, produce trail maps, and so much more. \n\nThis was during the fire season as well, and we were working with the forest service to get the wilderness areas reopened in time for hunting. They were absolutely incredible, but the fire maps would update on a daily basis and conditions would change regularly. Keeping up on Facebook was an hour-by-hour affair. It would have been useful at the time to have a tool to get the public information and maps.\n\nI also considered people who are hiking and lost. It's easy to find their location with a map pin, and then generate a trail map for them. It could help people like [Celine Cremer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIRrBtt4-UE&list=PLvs9mmSHrd6QjZ6Xnub3X-0X-L4Ra7el6) who got lost in New Zealand, or [these 2 hikers on Mount Rainier](https://people.com/bodies-of-2-missing-climbers-recovered-at-approx-9600-ft-in-mount-rainier-national-park-11891924).\n\nIn November I started development, then I broke my leg, and in December I finished the initial MVP. I registered my LLC, did all the paperwork, and talked with my tax advisor and a business consultant. I ran the idea past a number of people and they all thought it was amazing.\n\nMy initial users had fun with it and found it extremely easy to use. You just send a text message, no app. I gave away a few free accounts, knowing that I would eat those costs.\n\nI posted the app here and in LinkedIn to see how many users would bite. I got a bunch of bot accounts that couldn't verify their phone numbers, one real user who verified their phone number and earned the free account (thanks!), but I realized that I couldn't give away free accounts to bots, so I made a change to prevent bad signups and everything stopped. I also removed the free tier since I'm not made of money (but I really want to bring it back!).\n\nThe change was to prevent bots from flooding my database with crap accounts by verifying your phone number during sign up. Pretty simple really, if you're a real person then you have your phone with you. The problem was, I didn't know that Stripe has a test system, so I didn't initially have a way to test purchases without spending my own money (stupid that I didn't ask Claude or Gemini first). I have since fixed this, and found that there were a few signup and login bugs which would hinder signups and completely block email-based logins. \n\nMy Twilio API also got hacked by a South African person, I fixed that. I think I know who it was, some nice kid who tried to scam me for money for a PS5. I could only offer him a free account with unlimited usage, but he never registered. Twilio locks the account when they see weird things like this, blocking the business from working. I had to create a notification system at 2am that night. Then I changed my geo rules to allow registration for certain countries. My first international user was from Denmark, but the service can work for 24 countries and 4 satellite phone services.\n\nThis was a real lesson in ensuring your login and signup/payment forms are damn near perfect before release.\n\nNow to the numbers. This is for the last 30 days or for January (depending on the service billing).\n\n**Twilio**: \n\n- 1290 transactions\n- $10.707 SMS spend\n- $23.86 total spend. \n- That's $0.018 average spend per transaction.\n- Carrier fees are roughly 1/2 of SMS fees. MMS fees are minimal.\n- The largest day was Jan 03 when I was doing a lot of testing with 104 messages running a bill of $2.37.\n\n**Stripe**: \n\n- $0 earned\n- ($1.82) owed due to refunding myself like an idiot instead of using a test token. This will come out of the first real customer (or my payment if I buy my own product for a quick test).\n\n**GCS** (usage cost and subtotal shown, savings are being applied): \n\n- Vertex AI: $185/$84 (usage vs what I paid)\n- Cloud Run: $59/$45\n- Others: $14.90/$9.93\n\n**AWS**:\n\n- App Runner: $41.94\n- Others: $3.77\n\nOther business expenses (registration, phone number, etc.): ~$500.\n\n**Total**: \n\n- $208.50 in service costs/mo\n- ~$708.50 total counting business registrations and other factors.\n\n**Claude**: \n\n- We don't talk about it. Claude is a money whore, and I only use it occasionally when Gemini just can't figure it out.\n- Claude is much better than Gemini for coding tasks IMO, but it's so darned expensive! Every interaction is another $11, and they spam my email every time.\n\n**Gemini**:\n\n- Essentially free. I think I have a Pro plan for personal use and I always use Gemini 3. I've only hit the limit once and it switched back to Gemini 2.5, which is arguably a better system IMO. Gemini 3 is like an ADD child that always wants to take shortcuts and do the lazy thing first. My GEMINI.md file is like a prison rulebook compared to Claude's file.\n\n**Path to profitability**:\n\nIf I can get about 120 paid Explorer users then I'll cover my costs (net earnings).   \nOR If I can get 69 Ranger users then I can cover costs.  \nOR if I can get 1 enterprise user then I can cover the costs.\n\n**Marketing**:\n\nMarketing is the next challenge. I have no income at the moment, so everything has to be grassroots (hello redditors!). \n\n- I've posted on LinkedIn, reddit, and facebook. I have business profiles in all three places, see /r/ridgetext\n- I've optimized the website and began adding more pages for [better searchability](https://imgur.com/a/WXBCboN).\n- I [created a Youtube short](https://youtube.com/shorts/TQMcDPrAa8s) - accidentally, I thought it would be a regular video but Youtube decided to post it to Shorts. My son actually saw it! 37 people saw it, 1 like (me).\n- I've recorded a number of videos and deleted every one of them in shame because I'm not good at making videos, or because I found a bug in the middle of the video. I have to get over this because people need to see it in action.\n\nI want to go to outdoors shows and see what people think. I also want to see if people in /r/hunting would like it, or any of the camping subreddits.\n\nI've also considered enterprise users like forest service, firefighters, rangers (hence the name of one of the pricing tiers), government agencies (SAM registration is pending), fishing boats, and international shipping. The main bottleneck for me is finding who to contact and what to say. My next step is creating a pitch deck for these enterprises.\n\nAnyways, I'm having a lot of fun creating this, even if it's just something I use myself, but I would love if more people could find value in such a simple solution for off-grid internet and mapping access.",

      "text": "“If we paid for it, we own it.”\n\nOn the surface, that statement feels reasonable because it matches how most people think about buying something: money changes hands, the work gets delivered, and ownership transfers cleanly from one side to the other.\n\nBut anyone who has actually delivered IT projects at scale knows the reality is far more layered, because most teams are not building everything from scratch for every engagement, and they cannot afford to if they want to ship quickly, price competitively, and maintain quality.\n\nBehind almost every “custom build” sits an ecosystem of existing frameworks, internal libraries, deployment scripts, templates, boilerplate modules, and tooling that existed long before a particular client ever entered the picture.\n\nThose assets are not shortcuts in the lazy sense. They are the delivery engine.\n\n**### Where Contracts Flatten the Most Important Nuance**\n\nThe problem usually starts with one sentence that looks harmless when the relationship is healthy:\n\n“All deliverables belong to the client.”\n\nThat clause rarely causes conflict while things are going well, because during delivery everyone is focused on progress, timelines, and getting to the finish line. But contracts are not really interpreted during good times. They get interpreted when something becomes uncomfortable, when a deadline slips, when a handover becomes tense, or when someone on the client side starts asking for “everything” as part of closure.\n\nOnce that clause is read literally, reusable components start getting treated like bespoke IP that was created specifically for the project. Internal tooling is assumed to be part of the handover. Build scripts, deployment automation, templates, and even general-purpose modules that you use across multiple clients start getting pulled into the client’s ownership expectations, even though none of those items were scoped, priced, or intended to leave your environment.\n\nAnd when you try to explain the distinction later, it rarely lands as a reasonable boundary. It often lands as “you’re withholding what we already paid for,” which is where relationships start to strain even when nobody is acting in bad faith.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that ownership is not implied by effort, timelines, or invoices paid. Ownership is created by what the agreement clearly defines, and anything left vague will eventually be interpreted in the way that benefits the party who is demanding more.\n\nIf you do not separate what is built specifically for the client from what powers your business internally, you end up giving away leverage without noticing it in the moment. Each vague clause makes the next project harder to price because you lose the ability to reuse what you have already built. Each unclear handover expectation chips away at your standardisation, your delivery speed, and your ability to scale without burning out your team.\n\nOver time, this stops being a one-off misunderstanding and becomes a structural business problem, because you start hesitating to invest in better internal tooling when there is a risk that every improvement will later be treated as client-owned property.\n\n**### How IT Teams Fix This Without Making It Adversarial**\n\nThe fix is not aggressive language or defensive behaviour. The fix is practical clarity that removes ambiguity before it becomes emotional.\n\nStrong agreements define categories of IP in plain terms, so there is a clear separation between:\n\na) what is custom-developed for the client during the engagement, and\n\nb) what already existed before the project began, including your internal libraries, frameworks, scripts, templates, and know-how.\n\nWhere ownership does not make commercial sense, the contract should grant a license instead, so the client can use what they need to operate the deliverables without turning your internal engine into their asset.\n\nJust as importantly, the agreement should clearly state what gets handed over at the end of the project and what does not, because handovers are where misunderstandings tend to surface first.\n\nAnd pricing needs to match those boundaries, because clients are rarely upset about limits when those limits were visible upfront and reflected in the commercial structure, rather than introduced after delivery when they already feel entitled to everything.\n\n**### Final Thoughts**\n\nPaying for development does not automatically mean owning everything behind it. When contracts fail to separate custom work from pre-existing IP, IT teams quietly give away leverage, create avoidable friction, and make future delivery harder than it needs to be.\n\nGood contracts do not slow teams down. They protect the engine that makes delivery possible.\n\nWhen ownership is clear from the start, projects stay focused on outcomes instead of arguments, and teams grow sustainably without accidentally giving their business away one vague clause at a time.[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1qugnjt)",

Smart advisors being ignored because their feedback hurts the ego.  \n2. Experienced operators being dismissed because they don’t “sound exciting”.  \n3. Real builders being overlooked while loud talkers take center stage.  \n4. Ego kills more startups than competition.  \n  \n\"The best founders I know: They listen more than they speak\". Separate signal from noise. Invite people who challenge them. Keep their ego outside the meeting room.  \n  \nYour next breakthrough might not come from your pitch deck but It might come from someone you’re not listening to yet.  \n  \nHence, choose your people wisely.
