They fall straight into what I call the **'Circle of Delusion'** (chasing investors instead of users).Your advice on hiring a good accountant is also underrated. Operational chaos kills more startups than competition does.

I know this sounds totally made up, but if you DM me, I can send you screenshots of the conversation. It surprised me too.                                              \n\nSo bro, I've had these larger customers for over a year now, and it turns out they all needed more seats, and I could have been making at minimum 10% more per customer. I just literally needed to ask the question. \n\nI never thought to upsell them this way. I'm a fucking idiot. \n\nI will be charging them $20/mo/seat, and it was an instant upsell that increased the revenue for all three accounts in less than an hour by 10%.                                  \n\nSo yeah. Don't just focus on net new customers. Focus on landing & expanding and upselling to existing customers. You don't need to just rely on increasing prices. The side benefit to upselling is that it helps with churn. It won't fix high churn, but it helps with the small leaks.             \n\nIf you're building a B2B SaaS, what other ways have you experimented with to increase revenue for existing customers? What value were you trying to drive? ",

We used to get a lot of push back on the integration fee but never on onboarding. \n\nI realized that's because as soon as I charge for onboarding, in teh customer's frame of reference, I now own the KPI of change management; to ensure people use the product and adopt it soon enough.\n\nWhereas when it comes to the integration free, the customer's frame of reference is that this should be part of the product; if you have an integration I should get that for free.\n\nSo what changed? Now, we offer integration for free but charge decently well for onboarding & setup, and customers pay that happily.  We get covered for the effort we put in, without losing on the perceived value.\n\nRecently, we also noticed there is significant churn in our industry and teams need to be retrained on our software (usually every 5-6 months). Earlier, retraining on our software was a casual excercise that happened internally, but no one owned it as a metric. Now that we charge for it, customers are happy to shift that KPI to us.\n\nThis ties back to your point on removing the friction component. I think customers are happy to pay, we just dont show enough value.",

The discount makes the entry price very attractive, but you are basically locking yourself into their ecosystem for a couple of years. If your project is simple, like a blog, portfolio, or small business site, it usually works out fine and saves money upfront.\n\nWhere people get disappointed is when their needs grow. Scaling, advanced support, or custom setups can feel limiting compared to higher end hosts. So in my view, the discount is worth it only if you know exactly what you are building and do not expect major changes soon. Otherwise, the cheap price can turn into regret later when renewal time hits or you want to move.",

We used to be in the space with 9 desks ourselves before they moved out. I posted it on the common real estate portals to find preferrably another tech startup or agency but so far no interest, even though it's reasonably priced and quite spacious. Munich commercial real estate market just has too much offer in regard to demand IMO.\n\nWe don't really use it for ourselves and currently, it's just an empty space (ping pong table would be too loud as it's an open space with in our regular office). Thought about renting it out as flexible single spaces. However, I don't want to be burdened with the admin that something like that requires.\n\nDo you have any ideas on what I can do with it?

Most good ideas come from noticing problems in jobs you've had or industries you've worked in, not from brainstorming in silo. Stop waiting for a genius idea, there's no such thing. Just start paying attention to what frustrates people and what they complain about spending money on. ",

You are 22, and what you’re feeling is something I’ve seen in **hundreds of aspiring founders during my 15 years as a mentor** (after 20 years in global multinationals). You are stuck in the **'Circle of Limbo'**: overthinking the destination before even taking the first step. Here is the raw truth you won't find in 'hype' SaaS tweets:\n\n1. **Forget the 'Genius Idea':** Most successful businesses are built on 'boring' problems, not revolutionary inventions. Don't look for an idea; look for a person with a problem they are willing to pay to solve.\n2. **Service > Product (for now):** Since you have no capital and no tech skills, **start with a service**. It teaches you sales and operations without the cost of manufacturing.\n3. **The 'Frankenstein' Trap:** You’re worried about offices and regulations before you even have a single customer. That’s how you build a 'Frankenstein'—a structure with no soul. Your 'office' is your laptop.\n\nIn my book, **'StartUp Inferno'**, I explain that the deepest circle of failure is **Denial**. Don't deny your reality: you are an apprentice. Find a local business, offer to solve a specific problem for them, and start there.\n\nWhat is one skill you have right now that a 50-year-old business owner might struggle with?",

If you stay close to customers long enough, a product will naturally come out of that work. You will start seeing the real problems, the real gaps, and what people are actually willing to pay for. That is where good product ideas come from.\n\nThe real question is not whether you have the idea. It is whether you have the stomach to hear “no” today and still pick up the phone and continue your outreach tomorrow. Selling is the first skill. Everything else comes later.\n\nYou can always partner with the right people once you know what truly sells. Start selling what you use. If you don’t like to sell a service then look for a product to sell. Now think about how you will reach your first customer",
