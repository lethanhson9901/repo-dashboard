Here are the rules:\n\n> Just tell me what data you want to scrape in the web (nothing behind auth for now, still working on that part)\n\n> I MUST confirm whether I think your request is possible first.\n\n> If you ask to scrape 100s, 1000s or 10,000s, I will provide you just a sample to make sure I can go through all the requests. \n> If my general AI agent can’t create a csv, excel, json etc… list (it can create files) based on your request. I will send you $2.\n\n> Those $2 will be sent to you via Venmo, PayPal or Zelle (ONLY).\n\n> If it fails, please let other people in the comments know so we don’t get the same request.\n\n> If it works, please let other people in the comments know so we don’t get the same request.\n\n> If there is any ambiguity, I will ask for clarification. \n\nWe’ll define a successful scrape if the file produced matches your request.\n\nLet the fun begin!

The demand for reliable, automated data scraping is huge - businesses constantly need structured data from websites for market research, competitor analysis, lead generation, etc.\n\n\n\nWhat you're building could easily evolve into a SaaS product. Imagine a no-code scraping platform where users just describe what data they want and your AI agent figures out how to extract it. The key differentiator would be handling edge cases, dynamic content, and adapting to site changes automatically.\n\n\n\nThe pricing model writes itself: charge per successful scrape, with different tiers based on complexity (static pages vs. JavaScript-heavy sites, auth-protected content, etc.). Businesses would pay premium for reliability and not having to maintain their own scraping infrastructure.\n\n\n\nGood luck with the stress test - you're validating something people actually want to pay for!",

What strikes me most is how diverse the scraping needs are in this thread - from sports memorabilia pricing to medical wholesaler data to restaurant reviews. This validates that there's no one-size-fits-all solution yet.\n\n\n\nThe real challenge isn't just the scraping itself, but maintaining reliability as websites constantly change their structures. A truly valuable product would need to:\n\n1) Auto-adapt when sites update their HTML/CSS\n\n2) Handle anti-scraping measures gracefully\n\n3) Provide data quality validation\n\n\n\nThe tiered pricing model you mentioned makes perfect sense - charge based on complexity and volume. I'd add a subscription tier for recurring scrapes (e.g., daily price monitoring) since many businesses need ongoing data rather than one-time pulls.\n\n\n\nThe market opportunity is massive. Every company doing market research, competitor analysis, or lead gen could benefit from this. The key is making it so easy that non-technical people can use it without writing code.",

      "text": "Google’s UCP, from a technical vision standpoint, is a masterclass in top-level design. Rather than building yet another walled garden, it has positioned itself as the leader of a “protocol alliance,” weaving together key existing protocols—A2A (agent communication), MCP (tool access), AP2 (payment authorization)—with the common thread of “commercial transactions.” It’s akin to drafting a constitution for the AI-powered commerce world, defining not only the rights and duties of its citizens (AI agents) but also the rules for currency (payments) and diplomacy (cross-platform collaboration).\n\nTechnically, UCP’s brilliance lies in “composition over creation”:\n\n1. The Art of Interface Abstraction: It abstracts complex commerce flows (checkout, identity, order management) into plug-and-play, standardized “building blocks.” By exposing a single UCP interface, a merchant essentially gets a universal “commerce USB-C” port for the AI world, compatible with any compliant agent. This drastically reduces integration friction across the ecosystem.\n2. A Well-Designed Chain of Trust: By integrating AP2’s dual mandates (intent + cart) and OAuth 2.0 for identity linking, it strikes a balance between convenience and security. AI agents are no longer “black boxes” making purchases; every user authorization becomes an auditable, on-chain credential. This lays the technical groundwork for trust in AI-driven commerce.\n3. A Pragmatic, Inclusive Strategy: Explicit support for MCP and A2A is likely UCP’s masterstroke. It means merchants’ existing MCP-based data tools and future A2A-based specialized service agents can seamlessly plug into the UCP flow. This is an ecosystem strategy designed to “unite all possible forces.”\n\nFrom a product and market perspective, UCP is a battle for “gateway defense” and “rule-setting power”:\n\n1. Google’s “Defensive Innovation”: In the AI era, the starting point for shopping may shift completely from search engines and price comparison sites to conversations with personal AI assistants. UCP is Google’s key infrastructure to ensure it remains relevant in this new traffic landscape. It aims to keep Google deeply embedded in the standard protocols and transaction flows of future commerce, wherever it begins.\n2. “Merchant-Centric” is Both Smart Messaging and a Real Need: UCP’s repeated emphasis on merchants retaining their “Merchant of Record” status and controlling their rules directly addresses retailers’ biggest fear: being commoditized and reduced to mere channels. This isn’t just PR messaging; it’s a prerequisite for ecosystem adoption. In contrast, Amazon’s closed-loop “Buy for Me” model, while smooth for users, essentially makes Amazon the intermediary and center of all transactions, a prospect that may unsettle brand owners.\n3. The “Standard Showdown” with OpenAI’s ACP is Inevitable: This forms the most intriguing competitive dynamic. OpenAI’s ACP, leveraging ChatGPT’s massive user base and Stripe’s payment network, has a head start. Their philosophies are remarkably similar, both pledging openness, open-source, and merchant-friendliness. In the short term, the industry risks a fragmented, dual-protocol reality, contradicting the very goal of reducing complexity through a unified standard. The decisive factors may be: who has the stronger alliance (Google currently leads in retail partners), who controls the more substantial entry-point traffic (OpenAI’s ChatGPT currently leads), and whose protocol is easier for SMBs to implement.\n\nInteresting Future Scenarios:\n\n* The Rise of “Agent SEO”: As UCP/ACP adoption grows, merchant focus may shift from traditional Search Engine Optimization to “Agent Optimization.” How to structure product info, promotions, and service capabilities to be more easily understood and recommended by AI agents will become a new competitive frontier.\n* Protocol Convergence or the Emergence of “Gateways”: The ideal outcome is convergence between UCP and ACP into a true single standard. If a stalemate persists, third-party “protocol gateway” services may emerge, helping merchants connect to and translate between both protocols—adding an unwelcome layer of cost and complexity.\n* Amazon’s Dilemma: Amazon’s absence is a major wild card. Will it continue building an ever-higher wall around its garden, or will it eventually join an open protocol? Its choice will significantly shape the battlefield.\n\nIn summary, Google’s UCP is a calculated move to secure its position in the new ecosystem. Its technical architecture demonstrates the vision and pragmatism of a giant, and its market strategy skillfully reassures the crucial merchant constituency. However, it has entered a race where a competitor already has a running start. While UCP paints a compelling vision of a “universal commerce language,” the path to realizing it is destined to be a hard-fought war requiring a combination of technology, business acumen, allies, and luck. This “first great protocol war of AI commerce” has only just begun.\n\nImage was generated by [Nano Banana Pro](https://www.netmind.ai/modelsLibrary/nano-banana-pro).",

I’d bet we see:\n\n\n\n– A de facto “agent middleware” layer that normalizes UCP, ACP, and whatever Amazon ships, the way Stripe normalized card rails.\n\n– A new role inside brands that’s half schema engineer, half growth marketer-owning product feeds, policies, and conversational affordances for agents.\n\n– Analytics products that track “share of agent recommendations” the way we track CTR from Google today; I’ve used tools like Segment and RudderStack for cross-channel data, Zapier/Make for glue, and Pulse for Reddit to watch how real users talk about these flows before betting on an integration strategy.\n\n\n\nMain point: protocol choice will matter less than how well merchants instrument, observe, and iterate on agent-facing touchpoints.",

Whichever protocol becomes the path of least resistance for agents will quietly set the rules, regardless of openness or intent.\n\nIf this turns into Agent SEO versus gateway middleware, we’ll know convergence failed.

Pick one core channel\nChoose the channel where your users already hang out (Reddit, Discord, Twitter/X, indie communities, etc.) and go deep instead of spreading thin. One well chosen channel beats five neglected ones.\n\n2. Talk to users before scaling\nEarly marketing is less about reach and more about learning. Conversations, feedback, and small wins beat big campaigns that don’t convert.\n\n3. Lead with the problem, not the product\nPeople don’t care about features. They care about the pain you’re solving and whether you understand it better than anyone else.\n\n4. Make onboarding frictionless\nEvery extra step kills momentum. If someone hears about your app and can’t “get it” in under a minute, you’ll lose them.\n\n5. Build in public only if it doesn’t drain you\nIt can work, but consistency matters more than visibility. If it becomes a chore, it’ll fail quietly.\nSolo founders win by being focused and human, not loud.",

When someone asks a question your app solves, mention it. Make short videos showing your app. Post on TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts. Show the problem, show your app solving it. Keep it under 60 seconds. Free and can go viral.\n\nAlso don't be ashamed to ask friends and family to try it. Get them to leave reviews on the app store. Reviews help other people find you. Post on Product Hunt when you launch. It's free and can get you a bunch of early users in one day.\n\nYou can also write simple blog posts about the problem your app solves. Not about your app and how amazing it is but about the problem. People search Google for solutions, find your post, then find your app. Answer questions on Reddit, Quora, Twitter. When people ask about problems your app fixes, help them and mention your app exists.\n\nI wouldn't run ads yet. You'll burn money fast and won't know what works. Save ads for when you have some users and money coming in. Don't build features nobody asked for. Talk to your first 10 users and ask what they need. Your first 10-50 users come from you talking to people. In communities, in real life, wherever. It's slow and annoying but it's free. If you want to see what other solo founders do for marketing with no budget let me know and I can share couple of great guides that help a ton.\n\nWhat kind of app did you build?",

I’m not an expert, but have a network of people who could potentially be clients.\n\nI guess he realized there’s potential in this idea after consulting with other friends of his and now he’s trying to constantly pick my brain, setting up calls just to extract information about the weak points I’m noticing, however we haven’t really done much more than that. The first time we ever spoke, he said we could possibly work together. But that was about it. Nothing concrete.\n\nWe’ve been on 3 calls and it’s mostly been just him extracting information. He knows that I know people but he seems to want to bring them into his personal network with me presenting them to him. This is where I’m starting to go “hmm”.\n\nI’m just curious. He might have good intentions and just wants to learn as much as he can, but I feel like I don’t want to commit any further to him unless there’s a clear direction on where we’re headed… and even if I would want to work with him. Other than our few calls, I’ve never met him. He mentioned possibly flying out to meet me depending on how things go.\n\nHow would you proceed?",

Thats a good degree of due diligence before committing. But now you need to demand that commitment.\n\nReality is that, to make such an illogical decision as to build your own business (you could live a much better quality life for much lower risk working for someone else), you must be comfortable making bets. \n\nIf, despite all the meetings etc, he is still not committed enough to give this a go, either he is not prone to risk enough (not ideal for a cofounder of a non-existing business given it will only be very risk-prone decisions from day 0 onwards) or he is digging as much info as possible to do something similar.\n\nEither way, he is not the guy for you.\n\nI would establish ownership terms prior to bringing someone else onboard. Registering a limited company (or equivalent in your region) is usually quite cheap (in the UK it is literally 12£ and you do it directly via the government's website). \n\nThen, you either hire as a contractor (strongly recommend - purely because yall need to \"get to know each other before getting married\") and then, if need be, discuss equity and allocate shares.\n\nThe real question is: are YOU ready to make this a bit more real, or are you happy just fantasizing about it?

It’s just been two dudes talking about weak points in an industry and trying to discover what the potential is. \n\nWhen it’s this early in the talks, what type of contract do you establish?",

You folks showed a lot of love and had a ton of great feedback. \n\nThe Kitchen Table goes live on Product Hunt today.\n\nThis app started as a simple idea. A quiet place to write things out without performance without metrics and without pressure to be anything other than honest.\n\nIf you have used the app  \nIf you have written something you did not expect to come out  \nIf the idea of a calmer corner of the internet matters to you\n\nWe would really appreciate your support today.\n\nHere is the Product Hunt link:  \n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/the-kitchen-table?launch=the-kitchen-table](https://www.producthunt.com/products/the-kitchen-table?launch=the-kitchen-table)\n\nUpvoting helps a lot but even more helpful is feedback. What feels right. What feels off. What you wish existed.\n\nThank you for being here and for helping shape what this table becomes.\n\nPS: If you're yet to checkout the product, head over to [https://thekitchentable.site/](https://thekitchentable.site/)  \n(It's completely free and ad-less)",
