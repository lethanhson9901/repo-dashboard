That's huge.\n\nNow you should treat your discord as your first test group not your first sales channel.\n\nStart by inviting a small portion of your most active members to try the product early and ask for genuine feedback .Position it as \"help us shape this\" rather than \"please buy this\". People are much more willing to participate when they feel involved in building something.\n\nIf the feedback is good and the product resonates then you can share it more broadly in the server. Even if only 10%convert at first, that is a strong starting point and more importantly, those early user will naturally talk about it inside the community. That organic word of mouth is way more surface bugs, suggest upgrades, and tell you where people are getting stuck. That feedback loop is the real value of having a community.\n\nThe key is making them feel like insiders and contributors not customers being marketed to.",

We handle the structuring, match the right vetted professional, and stay accountable for the outcome.\n\nIt covers multi trade services including handyman work, cleaning, plumbing, electrical jobs and general residential maintenance.\n\nI’ve spent 15 plus years hands on in London property maintenance and have seen how messy the industry can be from both sides.\n\nCustomers compare profiles, chase updates, argue over vague pricing and often feel unsure who to trust.\n\nProviders deal with pay to play platforms, subscription fees, paying to bid, and racing to the bottom.\n\nWe’re building a cleaner structure. The operating model is defined, we have a CTO onboard, and we’re close to completing our initial pilot phase in London.\n\nI’m looking for a serious co founder who wants real ownership over growth and early execution. Equity based. Hands on. Not advisory.\n\nI’m also open to someone ambitious who wants exposure to how a real business gets built from the inside. This would be voluntary at the start, working closely with me on real tasks and real decisions. If you prove yourself and become genuinely valuable to the build, there’s a path to long term responsibility and potentially equity. No guarantees, just real opportunity for the right person.\n\nIf this resonates, DM me your LinkedIn and a short note about yourself and which route you’re interested in.\n\nEddie",

      "text": "I recently deep-dived into the story of Natalia Zorina, who built a massive luxury rental business in Miami. Most \"hustle\" stories skip the messy parts, but this one was actually practical.\n\n**The 3 biggest takeaways for anyone building a service business:**\n\n1. **The \"Third Trip\" Rule:** Her first car got wrecked on just the 3rd trip. Instead of quitting, she realized the insurance/platform system actually worked. It turned a fear into a scalable process.\n2. **Scaling through Co-hosting:** She doubled her fleet overnight from 10 to 20 cars by managing other people’s assets (70/30 split). This is how you scale without burning your own capital.\n3. **The Platform Trap:** She was doing huge numbers on a major platform until she got banned in May 2025 with one email. Since she already had \"Plan B\" (Private rentals via Google Ads/Brokers), her business survived.\n\n**The Math of a Red Corvette (Real numbers she shared):**\n\n* Lease: $1,200/mo\n* Turo Revenue: \\~$2,600/mo\n* Private Rental Revenue: \\~$4,000/mo\n\nIt’s a reminder that \"rented land\" (platforms) is great for starting, but private ownership of the customer is the only way to stay safe.\n\nI wrote a full breakdown of her operations, financing with no credit, and how she handles the \"Roblox-spending\" 9-year-old son who helps with reviews lol.\n\n**Link to full breakdown:** [https://www.thestartupstorys.com/2026/02/how-one-immigrant-built-100-car-luxury-rental-startup-in-miami.html](https://www.thestartupstorys.com/2026/02/how-one-immigrant-built-100-car-luxury-rental-startup-in-miami.html)\n\nHappy to discuss the co-hosting model or her financing strategy in the comments!",

      "text": "I hit $12k/mo in January and my SaaS is completely bootstrapped!\n\nI haven’t had a viral blow-up or anything, I’ve just been working hard and grown steadily since I started almost 1.5 years ago.\n\nFor context, my SaaS is focused on product development.\n\nI wanted to make this post because I remember starting out and falsely believing that growth would come from going viral and then sort of just exploding from there. That hasn’t been the case at all.\n\nI guess the “boring news” is that it just takes a ton of consistent work. But all work isn’t equal and there’s definitely been things that had a bigger impact on my growth.\n\nSo these are the 4 big things that really made a difference for me:\n\n**1. Validating my idea before building**\n\nI validated my idea through a survey on Reddit which showed me there was demand and I was onto something. This was something I had failed with before which led to months of building and marketing something no one wanted. Those months really sucked. The demand was clearly confirmed when I later launched and got 100 users in the first 2 weeks (a big moment for me).\n\n**2. Clearly defining my ICP**\n\nThis is a constant work in progress but it’s really made a difference for me. I keep a document where I add notes and insights based on every piece of feedback I get about my ICP. This feedback comes from emails, social media comments, talking to my customers, etc. Basically all info that helps me paint a clear picture in my mind of exactly who I'm building for. My ICP affects all my decisions from how I should improve my product to how I shape my marketing message. My experience has been that you can always go deeper in your understanding of your ICP and this is how you build a product they love and how you do marketing they can’t ignore.\n\n**3. High-volume marketing**\n\nThe key to my content marketing (X, LinkedIn, Reddit) has been high volume since the beginning. When I started out I underestimated how much volume it takes to get results. Marketing is competitive. You’re competing for the same attention as everyone else. High volume gets you seen but it’s also what lets you learn faster and improve so you become more competitive. An example of this is when I was marketing my MVP on X. I did 3 posts and 30 replies every day for 1.5 months. Someone starting out might aim for “a few” posts per week thinking it’s enough to grow and see results.\n\n**4. Getting on calls with my users**\n\nActually talking to my users helped me figure out what to build and what people really needed. This is what let me shape the app to truly fit the market need and it’s a big reason why my word of mouth spread has been so good. Calls aren’t the only form of feedback of course, I also recommend making it as simple as possible for your users to leave feedback within your product. All forms of feedback has helped me a ton. To get calls I have a simple email in my funnel asking them if they’d be willing to jump on a quick call to give feedback (you'd be surprised by how many are willing to do it).\n\nAll this might not sound like magical advice but it’s the stuff that genuinely worked based on my own experience.\n\nIf you want more fun advice you’ll have to ask someone who went viral on tiktok I guess.\n\nAnyways, I’m still early in my journey and I’m super happy with what I’ve achieved so far bootstrapped!",

The more precisely you understand who you're building for, the clearer product, messaging, and roadmap decisions become. Also +1 on user calls, nothing replaces hearing where the product actually creates value.  \nLooking back, was your early growth more by problem urgency or by distribution consistency?",

The tests started off as a 'free time COVID thing to make money' and I haven't stopped doing them. These test platforms ask for your profession then link you to tests that they think you will have the most impact on. I have done test for multiple companies (very large conglomerates and smaller companies) as well as multiple types i.e. moderated tests which usually entail a designer going through the flow and ask you questions to get your input as well as unmoderated tests where you will do a recording of yourself interacting with their product. The tests do greatly vary i.e. from dashboards, to mobile apps, to ecommerce, websites etc. A lot of them are prototypes of a product, feature etc. Some are as simple as just asking your opinion on a name for a new feature while some are much more technical and require you to complete tasks on figma with the prototype. To be honest, I feel the major issue is just trying to put yourself in YOUR customers shoes- A lot of companies get this wrong for various reasons/some of the reasons your mentioned above. If you get this wrong from the get-go there's no turning back. For example, a recent moderated test I did involved a revolving credit facility feature but there was too much unrelated/high level jargon for example, wording like 'credit allocation' instead of 'expected credit' The webpage also was too long for what they were trying to accomplish. The feedback I gave them was to condense and remove all the jargon all together to make the product experience a bit more simpler and intuitive for the customer they were trying to connect with.

I like how you explained it above, \"You snap a photo of something like packaging or food, and the app analyzes how environmentally friendly it is and gives you feedback.\" Try putting this wording on your home page and let the user get greeted with this instead of  \"The world's first AI-Verified ledger for personal impact...prove your impact.\" Also the word 'audit' can be very broad and lost in translation, perhaps look for simpler wording i.e. like 'Start your first label scan' etc. Also your light mode text gets lost in between the colour scheme i.e. the grey with white text gets really difficult to read i.e. 'capture, analyze and ascend' maybe change the grey text background for something slight darker/change the wording or put an outline on the wording so its easier to read. You also mention some benefits i.e. CO2 credits etc, perhaps try making this more apparent on the landing page as well so the user can see the true benefit they get from using the platform. Perhaps also add images of actual/common product labels so people see how the platform works. Other than that I think its a great site and has a lot of potential. Thanks",

      "text": "Most scope creep does not arrive loudly or with formal paperwork attached. It rarely shows up as a clearly defined change request or a neatly scoped new module. More often, it sounds like agreement.\n\nA feature gets mentioned casually during a call. A stakeholder types “that works” in Slack. A product owner nods during a demo and moves on without asking follow-up questions.\n\nThe team feels aligned, so they proceed. Work gets done. Hours are logged. Dependencies shift slightly to accommodate what feels like a minor tweak rather than a real change.\n\nThen something predictable happens.\n\nAn invoice is questioned. A timeline is challenged. A deliverable is reviewed with fresh eyes. Suddenly, no one remembers approving that change. What once felt like a green light now sounds like “we were just discussing options.”\n\nThis is the quiet danger of verbal scope. In delivery environments, memory is unreliable, especially when pressure increases. Conversations blur, context disappears, and what felt obvious at the time becomes debatable when budgets tighten or deadlines slip.\n\n**### If It Isn’t Written, It Doesn’t Exist**\n\nThis is the uncomfortable legal reality most teams only learn after being burned. If scope is not written down, it effectively does not exist.\n\nThat is not because anyone is acting dishonestly. It is because written confirmation is the only stable record when things become tense. When disagreements arise, intentions stop mattering. What matters is what can be pointed to clearly and unambiguously.\n\nI have seen this pattern across IT service providers, SaaS implementation teams, and development agencies. It rarely begins with conflict. It begins with good intentions.\n\nTeams want to be helpful. They want to maintain momentum. They do not want to slow things down with documentation for what feels like a small adjustment.\n\nBut small adjustments accumulate.\n\nA minor integration tweak turns into additional testing cycles. A quick dashboard change requires backend restructuring. A simple vendor coordination call becomes weeks of cross-team troubleshooting.\n\nBecause none of it was formally recorded, all of it gets absorbed quietly into margins.\n\nThat is how profitable projects slowly turn into break-even projects without anyone being able to pinpoint when the shift happened.\n\n**### Clarity Is an Operational Discipline, Not Distrust**\n\nThe lesson here is not about mistrust. It is about operational clarity.\n\nIf work matters, it deserves a written yes. That principle protects both sides. It creates a shared record of what was agreed, when it was agreed, and what that agreement affects.\n\nFor IT teams, this does not require heavy bureaucracy. It requires discipline.\n\nStart by clearly defining what constitutes a scope change in your contract. Do not limit this to major features alone. Additional integrations, vendor coordination, workflow redesigns, extended support, and new reporting requirements should all be explicitly called out.\n\nNext, implement lightweight written confirmations. This does not mean drafting a lengthy amendment for every adjustment. A structured change order template or a clearly documented email summary that requires written approval is often enough. The goal is traceability, not formality.\n\nThen, build dependency rules into your agreements. If new inputs are required, timelines shift automatically. If third-party vendors delay access or responses, deadlines move by design. When this is agreed upfront, it stops becoming a negotiation later.\n\nFinally, train your team to pause before saying “that works.” Alignment in conversation is not the same as contractual approval. Empower project managers to say, “We’ll confirm this in writing and share an updated scope.” That single sentence can protect months of margin.\n\n**### Final Thoughts**\n\nMost scope creep does not look like a big request. It sounds like verbal agreement. When changes are not written down, they are easy to deny later, and delivery teams quietly absorb extra work.\n\nClear written scope and simple confirmation processes protect margins, timelines, and relationships.\n\nOne of the hardest lessons in running an IT practice long-term is realizing that sustainability is rarely destroyed by large mistakes. It is eroded by small, undocumented agreements repeated over time.\n\nGood clients do not resist clarity. In fact, the best ones appreciate it.\n\nClear scope prevents surprise invoices, misaligned expectations, and unnecessary tension. It keeps delivery predictable, professional, and scalable.\n\nBecause in the end, scope creep is not a dramatic event. It is drift. And drift only stops when someone writes things down.[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1rd8os1)",
