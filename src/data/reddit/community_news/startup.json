Keep the service but change the device\n\nI no longer carry two phones. I use a virtual business number to connect to both my mobile phone and my desktop computer. I never share my personal line with clients; I can mute my phone after work without any guilt.\n\n2. Calls second, asynchronous first.\n\nI inform my clients that the quickest way to reach us is via email or text message. Furthermore, phone calls are best done by appointment only.\n\nMost problems don't actually require a call. We just call because it’s there.\n\n3. Working hours are preferred always on.\n\nI post clear windows like, “Free for calls 10am–2pm local.”.\n\nOther than that, it's all text/email. As a result, interruptions dropped by 70%.\n\n4. Call routing with ease.\n\nThose who don’t wish to speak to me go to voicemail with a clear promise (I’ll respond same day) \n\nFamiliar customers ring through.\n\nHush your noise without looking unprofessional.\n\n5. Just one place to reply.\n\nMessages from text, voicemail or email all end up in one single inbox. Instead of constantly reacting, I check it 2–3 times daily when I’m traveling.\n\nUnconventional lesson.\n\nOver-availability trains people to perceive everything as urgent.    When boundaries are clearly set, we build trust.\n\nThere is no need to vanish altogether, just simply ensure that you have a system that runs when you’re not engaged with it.",

Clients get a professional business line, you keep your personal number private, and you can stay mobile without being on call 24/7. Call forwarding alone usually breaks down once you want real boundaries.\n\nI work in this space, and this is exactly the transition most founders make once they stop being tied to a desk.",

Engage in conversations that are more personal.\n2. **Leverage Your Network**: Start with people you know. Offer free access and ask for honest feedback. They’ll usually be more open and invested in helping.\n3. **Value-First Outreach**: Instead of cold DMs, offer value upfront. Solve a problem they have, then tie it back to your tool and ask for feedback.\n4. **Live Demos/Webinars**: Hosting a live demo or small webinar can help you get more engaged users who are willing to give direct feedback.\n5. **Content Marketing**: Share content that solves their problems (like blog posts or videos). This can attract people already looking for solutions, making them more likely to try your product(on X or LinkedIn)\n\nI would say building your own personal brand vallue can leverage your customer base for your company I hope you get it!",

          "text": "I found your product with Google with the name you provided in the comments. \n\nTwo thoughts: \n\n1. Because the product is novel, it’s not immediately clear from the first viewport a) what it is b) who it’s for \n\n\nIf I were you I would:\n\nA) Try a different explanation on top  followed by the demo. And only after it’s clear what the product does and how it helps, I’d show the quickstart (“type a prompt…”). Also. When I was still trying to understand what the product does and I tried the prompt example and was then greeted with the signup, I was hugely annoyed. If I wasn’t trying to be helpful here, I would have quit then and there. \n\nB) create different landing pages for different use cases & audiences where the copy, demo, examples and the quickstart is tailored to each. Eg for Product builders who want feedback for their app. That way it’s easier for the target audience to “get it” without having to shift through long texts and different use cases to understand if it’s for them. \n\n\n2. When I finally found and tried the demo, it was/felt broken. \n\nA) There are delays of a ~second when the screen is blank or it’s just the static cursor. I later understood that it’s just AI “thinking” delay, but it doesn’t come off that way. I were you, I’d give it a loading state of three pulsating dots or something similar, to make it clear that we’re just waiting for a response here. \n\nB) I also couldn’t get past the second question. Just couldn’t click the “next” button even though I had entered text. I tried the Feedback and Survey option. \n\n…\n\nI didn’t sign up and I didn’t spend more time with the landing page. But I like the overall idea and I’m your potential target user (a product manager/solo-builder). Static feedback forms indeed lack depth while proper interviews take a lot of time, so this solution could be suitable in-the-middle alternative. \n\nGood luck!",

I feel very lucky to receive such detailed and thoughtful feedback, thank you so much for taking the time 🙏\n\nOur team really values this, and we discussed your points internally right away.\n\nYour first point is spot on. We’re still in an exploration phase and trying to narrow down the right use cases through early adopter feedback, so a larger page restructure is definitely coming. Based on your feedback, in the short term we’re also improving the basic guidance and prompts to make things much clearer.\n\nYour second point is also extremely helpful. The occasional 1s lag is an algorithm issue on our side, but we really liked your suggestion around a clearer “thinking/loading” state. We’ve already built it and are testing it now, and it should go live very soon.\n\nAs for not being able to move to the next question: it currently submits via the Enter key, which is clearly not obvious. That’s on us. We’ve already improved the button behavior and layout, and that update is also coming shortly.\n\nThanks again for the thoughtful and constructive feedback. It genuinely helps us a lot. Feel free to share any other thoughts anytime. Happy to help however we can, and always open to feedback.\n\nWish you all the best! 😊",

Is it more about clearly showing the product in action, or telling the story behind why it exists? I’m also wondering whether you’ve seen this work better for very early MVPs versus products that are already a bit more polished.\n\nEven if we don’t end up applying, the playbook videos sound genuinely useful.

      "text": "I've watched dozens of founders announce their fundraise over the past year. Most of them follow the same playbook: write a LinkedIn post, maybe a Twitter thread, attach some founder headshots, thank their investors, and call it a day.\n\nThey get 50 likes. Their investors comment. A few friends reshare. And then it's gone.\n\nMeanwhile, a handful of founders treat their fundraise like a marketing moment and the difference in outcomes is wild.\n\nWhy does this even matter?\n\nHere's what most founders don't realize: a fundraising announcement isn't just \"news.\" It's one of the only moments where you have a legitimate reason to be loud. You have something to say. People expect you to share it. And if you do it right, you're not just announcing money. You're doing three things at once:\n\n1. Building credibility. When your announcement gets traction, future investors see momentum. It makes the next round easier. The halo effect is real.\n2. Driving signups. A viral fundraising moment doesn't just impress VCs. It brings in users who were on the fence. People want to be part of something that's clearly working.\n3. Creating leverage. When everyone's talking about you, recruiting gets easier. Partnerships open up. Press reaches out. You're suddenly on people's radar.\n\nBest example I've seen: Arlan Rakhmetzhanov dropped a cinematic video recreating that famous scene from The Social Network. It hit 2-3 million views across LinkedIn and X. Investors reached out. Other YC founders started talking about him.\n\nThe money matters. But the attention you get for free might matter more.",

Everything I've read says I should form my LLC before leasing a space, that makes sense to me, the contract should be with the LLC not me as an individual. But when I'm looking into registering my LLC it wants a business address? From my understanding I could theoretically register this to my home (since technically I am working from home as I setup the business) but there are privacy concerns with that, and what about the registered agent? Should that be my home address? I feel like I'm going in circles. Also... what is this weird requirement in NY to post in newspapers? I see some people talking about you need to post it in a paper for 6 weeks, but I didn't see that on new york states website, just that I had to post it in 2 separate local newspapers... which seems like such a weird requirement and I'm told NY is the only state that has this requirement.

You can optionally designate a separate registered agent, but you do not have to. Many people still hire a registered agent service for privacy and reliability.\n\n**3) Leasing before vs after**  \nForming the LLC first is ideal, but landlords often still require a **personal guaranty** for new businesses. If timing gets tight, you can sometimes sign personally and **assign/novate** the lease to the LLC once formed (with landlord approval).\n\n**4) The newspaper requirement is real**  \nNY generally requires publishing in **two newspapers for six consecutive weeks** (picked by the county clerk), then filing a **Certificate of Publication** within 120 days.

That’s when it feels backwards. No amount of spend fixes weak demand.\n\nThe more interesting stuff I’ve seen isn’t ad-free, it’s where paid is almost invisible. Tools that spread because they’re useful, content that answers real intent, spend used to amplify something that already works instead of forcing it.\n\nTotally agree that broadcast thinking is outdated though. New channels, same mindset. That’s the real problem.\n\nGenuinely curious what you think replaces paid reach at scale, because even the best products I’ve seen usually need some kind of push early on.",

I have people waiting for me to get this product running, but we are having a really hard time finding developers. \n\nOur main issue is we don't have money. We have been doing this as a passion project and have been really avoiding VC and investing because we don't want the product to be owned by people who aren't invested in the concept and/or just want to use it for money. \n\nI understand equity can be sketchy or even end up being a dead end, but I was just hoping to get some advice maybe from other non-technical founders on where to look for people. \n\nUltimately we may very well just have to go the funding route, and I get that. We have a pitch deck made for that purpose and are getting to the point where we will probably have to do that, but just wanted to check here to see if anyone had any other ideas. \n\nThanks! ",

It got to the point of having so many meetings and pitches from others to get me to jump in on hair-brained ideas for no money that I had to direct people to an F-U page before they bothered to reach out to me.  Most anyone messaging me after that obviously didn't read it because it was the same tired story. the few that did read it and messaged anyway \"got it\", and usually had some kind of traction and an MVP already (poorly) built - but still no money.  That matching service showed me unequivocally that 99% of these \"founders\" have no idea what they're getting into.  I'm between jobs now and broke, but even if I had substantial savings I wouldn't waste my time on any of those pitches.\n\nIt basically amounts to someone is the \"ideas\" person who has domain knowledge and sees an opportunity. they write a few documents, come up with an outline, pretend to be the \"business\" side, then expect a developer to spend months of their lives for no money working on nothing more than someone else's dream.  I feel bad for young techies who will get burned far too many times before they realize the path they've gotten themselves into.\n\nMy advice for you - cough up some money, sell your car, mortgage your house, borrow from your parents to have some skin in the game.  then, hire a very-trusted and experienced developer that you can immediately fire if things don't go right. stay away from \"offshore\" devs who have zero accountability, or junior devs who haven't gained the wisdom to avoid pitfalls. if necessary, go through a technical recruiting agency who already has a roster of proven professionals.",

It gives people something concrete to build, reduces the trust barrier, and if you like working together, then the equity conversation becomes way easier. My husband’s in recruiting and he always says the same thing: equity is a story, not compensation, so your job is to make the story compelling enough that someone wants to opt in",

However, if you create a system that rewards customers for consistent visits, like earning points for each purchase that lead to meaningful rewards (like exclusive items, early access to specials, etc.), you can help shift the focus from just “getting a freebie” to becoming a part of your regular customer base.\n\nI’ve seen some coffee shops use QR-based loyalty apps successfully where users don’t just collect points, but also get personalized recommendations or rewards that feel more exclusive. The key is to make the program feel valuable beyond just saving money!",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nWe’re two developers who’ve spent the past year building a DeFi platform on Solana. We’re opening a closed beta and are looking for people who want to help shape it early through real usage and honest feedback.\n\n# Why we built this\n\nUsing crypto still feels harder than it should.\n\nEven experienced users end up juggling multiple tools, explorers, dashboards, and half-broken UIs just to answer basic questions like:\n\n* What actually happened on-chain?\n* Did my transaction go through?\n* Why did something fail?\n\nWe’ve both been actively using blockchains for over two years, and if we were running into these issues regularly, it was clear that the UX barrier for newer users is even higher.\n\nOur goal became straightforward:  \nBuild a transparent, community-first DeFi platform that reduces friction, explains what’s happening, and keeps users informed — without requiring 10 tabs or constant explorer checks.\n\n# What’s already live\n\n**Core functionality includes:**\n\n* **Activity Feed** – Discover and trade newly created tokens (on our platform and across Solana)\n* **Token Trading** – Full trading dashboard with charts and key metrics for any Solana token\n* **Swap** – Token swaps across the ecosystem\n* **Token Creation (V1 & V2)**\n* **Token Management** – Metadata updates, authority management, burns, supply locks, fee collection\n* **Liquidity Pool Creation & Management**\n\n# What we’re working on next\n\n* Public release\n* Different types of incubators\n* Deeper protocol integrations (and deploying our own programs)\n* Personalized news feeds\n* A gaming-focused section\n\n# Features we think matter\n\n* **Free API** with full documentation, integration guides, and demo apps\n* **Chain-style activity history** – see everything you’ve done with full context (no explorer needed)\n* **Learning modules** – structured education from beginner to advanced\n* **Step-by-step guides** throughout the platform\n* **4 supported languages**: EN, FR, DE, ES\n* Revenue-generation programs\n\nWe didn’t want to build “another DeFi site with three input fields.”  \nThe goal is something usable, explainable, and extensible — shaped by real users, not assumptions.\n\n# Why we’re opening a closed beta\n\nWe believe DeFi products work best when they’re shaped with the community, not after launch.\n\nWe’re inviting beta users to:\n\n* Test the platform\n* Share honest feedback (good or bad)\n* Suggest features or improvements\n* Help align the product with actual user needs\n\nIt doesn’t matter if you’re:\n\n* A casual user\n* New to crypto\n* A designer\n* A developer\n* Or someone with strong opinions about UX\n\nIf you care about improving DeFi usability, your input is valuable.\n\n# Beta details\n\n* The platform is public but it work based on wallet whitelisting for those who perform transactions\n* **Drop a comment and we will contact you.**\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* No downloads required\n* No wallet connection required to explore\n* Test wallets with SOL can be provided\n* No personal information required\n\nThanks for reading.  \nWe’re looking forward to learning from the community and improving this with your help.",

I don't have a massive budget for ads.\n\nI have a few VCs asking deep questions about manufacturing/unit economics. As a solo founder in high school, should I be spending hours building pitch decks for them, or ignore them to focus 100% on getting from 1 to 50 users? Which one matters more right now?\n\nHow do I prove \"traction\" for hardware without inventory? I'm doing a \"hardware as a service\" model ($49 + sub) to cover costs, but it's hard to scale without capital.\n\nAny advice on how to get out of this trough and actually start growing would be huge.",

Because most consumers want to look and feel and pilot the product before buying (or read reviews).\n\nTheres a few ways you can prove traction. In my opinion all of these should be used to show scale + quality.\n\n1. Build a waitlist (landing page) - for Scale. - Draw users to the landing page via social media content. Ship free models to people who can sell it for you via social media (influencers) and send users to the landing page to sign up/ get discount at launch.\n\n2. Conduct in-person interviews, then demo, then sell the product at the end of the demo with a letter of intent, deposit or pre-order - This is harder to scale but proves sale quality and gives you real-time feedback for improvements (also easier if B2B). Build an email list when inventory is ready. If you get bad feedback, make changes or pivot.\n\n3. Back the above evidence up with market research and data.\n\nI would steer clear of VC's this early - most are interested when you have reached a certain amount of scale - or they're more interested in low risk investments like software. I would definitely try and grow it organically at this early stage and keep slogging away at it. It's hard work!",
