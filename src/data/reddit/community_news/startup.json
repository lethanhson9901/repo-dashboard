As you haven't failed yet, the first couple of times it might feel horrible, but you will also most likely not regret it. \nIt sounds line you don't have big responsibilities right now, so today is the day to risk it and fail, tomorrow you may not have the privilege",

          "text": "I do quite a lot of research about this. I call it the “hallucination spiral”:\n\nYou built something nobody wants, but you do not know it yet. The Hallucination begins with conviction that feels like vision. Your early adopters are enthusiasts, friends of friends, people who will try anything new. You mistake their curiosity for demand. You raise a Series A on the story of what this could become, and the capital lets you avoid the truth for another two years. The 189 companies in this pattern burned $14.2 billion before admitting the market did not exist.\n\nAs the hallucination persists, you encounter The Math Problem. To manufacture demand where none exists organically, you pour money into customer acquisition. Your CAC climbs while lifetime value stays flat or shrinks. You tell yourself this is investment in growth, that you are buying market share, that unit economics will improve at scale. They do not. The 233 companies caught in unit economics failures burned $99.7 billion learning this lesson. You are now bleeding cash to acquire customers who do not really want what you are selling, in a market that may not exist at the scale you need.\n\nThe cascade ends at The Bonfire. You have spent years and tens of millions proving that your market thesis was wrong and your unit economics never worked. The 182 companies in this pattern burned $281.2 billion, the highest total of any failure mode, because they had enough capital to die slowly. Your median lifespan is 4 years. You will have multiple rounds of layoffs, several pivots that each burn another six months, and a final scrambling fundraise that fails because investors can see the pattern even if you cannot. The Hallucination Spiral kills slowly enough that you will remember every month of it. [source](https://www.loot-drop.io/why-they-fail)",

We recently tried moving our team to ZTNA and SASE to check those boxes, but it turned into a massive headache because of our client mix.\n\nThe reality is that a lot of our clients in finance and older industries still rely on legacy environments and on-prem servers. Most of the shiny new Zero Trust tools are built for cloud-native start-ups and they just do not play nice with these older setups. We actually found ourselves in a spot where the very tools meant to make us compliant were stopping us from accessing the environments we needed to bill hours.\n\nWe eventually pivoted back to a business VPN because it actually works across both legacy and modern systems without breaking everything. By handling the network and endpoint security as separate layers, we satisfied the insurance requirements without locking ourselves out of our clients tech.\n\nWhen we compared our options, PureVPN for Teams stood out for multi-client legacy access and was easy for compliance. NordLayer was fine for basic remote access, while Perimeter 81 was great for cloud-only teams but had low compatibility for our legacy needs.\n\nIf you handle a mix of client types, do not feel forced into a modern stack that kills your workflow just to pass a review. Has anyone else had to roll back a modern security setup because it did not work with your clients older infrastructure?",

      "text": "Building Fog of Mind: practical mental health support for high-pressure UK workplaces (NHS, education, construction)\n\nI’m John, UK-based, ex-British Army and now a risk manager. I built **Fog of Mind** after my own run-in with depression and years of watching capable people go quiet, burn out, or break, usually long before anyone calls it “a mental health issue”.\n\n# The problem I can’t unsee (and the numbers back it up)\n\nThese are three sectors where stress is not a footnote, it’s baked into the job:\n\n* **NHS:** In the NHS Staff Survey 2024, **41.63%** of staff said they felt unwell due to work-related stress, and **55.77%**reported going to work despite not feeling well enough to do their duties. ([nhsstaffsurveys.com](https://www.nhsstaffsurveys.com/static/c1a573e95b1a49428676ef4b24f5efe7/National-Results-Briefing-2024.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n* **UK education:** Education Support’s Teacher Wellbeing Index reports **77%** of education staff experience symptoms of poor mental health due to work, and **49%** say workplace culture negatively affects their mental health. ([educationsupport.org.uk](https://www.educationsupport.org.uk/resources/for-organisations/research/teacher-wellbeing-index/))\n* **UK construction:** Construction workers have been reported as being at **3.7x higher** risk of suicide than the national average (citing ONS), with evidence also pointing to **507 suicides in construction in 2021**. ([Mates in Mind](https://www.matesinmind.org/news/mental-health-in-uk-construction-the-statistics?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\nZoom out and it’s not just a “wellbeing” issue, it’s a productivity and stability issue: in Great Britain, **40.1 million working days** are lost due to work-related illness and injury, with an estimated **£22.9bn** cost (2023/24). ([HSE](https://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/overview.htm))\n\n# Why this feels urgent (and why I’m building a startup around it)\n\nBecause the current pattern is predictable:\n\n1. people struggle silently\n2. performance drops, relationships fray, absence increases\n3. the “support” arrives late, or not at all\n\nA lot of workplace mental health support is either too generic, too reactive, or too divorced from real working life. Fog of Mind is built around **early, practical intervention**: simple tools, conversation prompts, and routines that help people create headspace before things hit crisis level. It’s **not therapy**, and it doesn’t pretend to be.\n\n# What I’m looking for from the startup community\n\nIf you’ve built or scaled something in a regulated, people-heavy space (health, education, construction, HR), I’d value input on:\n\n* the fastest route to **first pilots** without getting trapped in procurement cycles\n* whether to start with **SMEs** (especially construction) vs going straight at enterprise/public sector\n* what you’ve found works for **pricing** practical workshops + ongoing support (without selling “wellbeing theatre”)\n\n.",

          "text": "Hi John, I think Fog of Mind is a great idea. The following is my take on the entire thing\n\n1. If you are pushing this towards business, the primary idea needs to shift from well-being, to impacts on their business due to a quantifiable change in well-being( risk reduction). Then possibly push wellbeing as a second part.\n\n2. I would recommend SMEs to go with, your background and experiences would work in your favour in pushing the change. Additionally,  you could also take a look at sectors that would easily adopt what you have; it is likely that there is going to be some \"cultural\" resistance to the entire concept of well-being.\n\n3. Pilots needn't be perfect for you, but I think they would need to be fast. Say 2-3 paid pilots, some testimonials and most definitely before and after data. You also use this to farm urgency.\n\n4. As for the pricing, it is imperative in my opinion that you don't price yourself on the lower end of the spectrum. It might be easier to sell initially but once you ramp up operations it will come to bite back at you.\n\nAgain these are just my thoughts on it, hopefully this helps you out in some capacity.\n\nAnd Best of Luck!",

          "text": "We’ve built a number of projects and applications for the medical sector (for example, [Mysti AI](https://lexogrine.com/success-stories/mystiai)). Many of them were startups, and their access to the market was fairly limited. The main challenges founders ran into were significant legal complexity and strict requirements around processing medical data (by definition, the most sensitive category of data), long, and sometimes very long, procurement cycles on the enterprise side, and often a certain reluctance to adopt new solutions.\n\nBased on that experience, I’d suggest starting with mid-sized organizations (10+, or even 50+ employees). Their budgets are typically large enough to make room for buying new solutions, their teams are big enough that chronic stress and burnout already meaningfully impact overall organizational performance, and their willingness to adopt innovation is often still high because they usually don’t have “ossified” processes. In large enterprises, even a small change can have major downstream consequences, so they are often less eager to introduce change.\n\nAn SMB customer base also helps you build experience and a track record that should make it easier to win enterprise clients later.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nFast iteration will be critical, because the market is highly competitive right now and you need to test multiple approaches to land on the best offer. At the same time, AI creates room for more flexibility, meaning you can deliver functionality that is more tailored to each client. Still, a human supervisor for the code will remain essential given the sensitivity of the data. I wouldn’t trust approaches like “vibe coding” in this context.",

      "text": "Hey. Building a regulated platform where money comes in, sits pending for a bit, then goes out. It is a marketplace plus some subscription flows, so matching references matters. Initial launch is EUR/GBP collections, then we add USD for international payuts, and GCC later with AED and BHD.\n\nFrom the infra side, I care about boring stuff. Consistent IDs between API, webhook, and statements. Clear statuses when something gets returned or stuck. And support that does not go silent when an investigation starts. I have seen teams drown in exceptions because the provider story looks great until month-end close, then it gets ugly fast.\n\nBanking Circle gets mentioned a lot for EU account infrastructure. Lorum is also on the shortlist.\n\nAnyone used either in prod?",

          "text": "One thing that really matters if you care about getting predictable outcomes is what I’ll call an intake to recon flow how easy is it to map an incoming collection event through to settlement with as little human context as possible? The teams that get this right tend to:\n\n* define a canonical reference early in the flow\n* treat webhook payloads as first class sources of truth not notifications\n* model statuses conservatively so pending isn’t confused with done\n\nI’ve also seen tools that mesh visibility into those flows not just dashboards cut down support cycles a lot. For example, with some of the newer AI aligned tracking layers like SyndrAI, the value came from removing ambiguity around what was being tracked and what was out of scope it wasn’t about hype, it was about having a single place to compare API events vs what landed in reporting.",

          "text": "Banking Circle is probably your best bet for the EU leg honestly. solid SEPA coverage, decent account infra and a LU banking license. \n\nLorum is more of a global play from what I see, single integration across markets rather than bolting on providers as you expand. If your GCC phase is definite and not just a maybe, worth looking at them earlier rather than later since adding AED/BHD through a separate provider later is a pain.",

I've seen firsthand how messy exceptions can get if your provider's API and reporting aren't perfectly aligned. Good luck finding the right fit! If you ever need to organize your job search docs or track applications, I've found tools that help keep all that info super clean and easily searchable really useful.",
