          "text": "I do quite a lot of research about this. I call it the “hallucination spiral”:\n\nYou built something nobody wants, but you do not know it yet. The Hallucination begins with conviction that feels like vision. Your early adopters are enthusiasts, friends of friends, people who will try anything new. You mistake their curiosity for demand. You raise a Series A on the story of what this could become, and the capital lets you avoid the truth for another two years. The 189 companies in this pattern burned $14.2 billion before admitting the market did not exist.\n\nAs the hallucination persists, you encounter The Math Problem. To manufacture demand where none exists organically, you pour money into customer acquisition. Your CAC climbs while lifetime value stays flat or shrinks. You tell yourself this is investment in growth, that you are buying market share, that unit economics will improve at scale. They do not. The 233 companies caught in unit economics failures burned $99.7 billion learning this lesson. You are now bleeding cash to acquire customers who do not really want what you are selling, in a market that may not exist at the scale you need.\n\nThe cascade ends at The Bonfire. You have spent years and tens of millions proving that your market thesis was wrong and your unit economics never worked. The 182 companies in this pattern burned $281.2 billion, the highest total of any failure mode, because they had enough capital to die slowly. Your median lifespan is 4 years. You will have multiple rounds of layoffs, several pivots that each burn another six months, and a final scrambling fundraise that fails because investors can see the pattern even if you cannot. The Hallucination Spiral kills slowly enough that you will remember every month of it. [source](https://www.loot-drop.io/why-they-fail)",

We recently tried moving our team to ZTNA and SASE to check those boxes, but it turned into a massive headache because of our client mix.\n\nThe reality is that a lot of our clients in finance and older industries still rely on legacy environments and on-prem servers. Most of the shiny new Zero Trust tools are built for cloud-native start-ups and they just do not play nice with these older setups. We actually found ourselves in a spot where the very tools meant to make us compliant were stopping us from accessing the environments we needed to bill hours.\n\nWe eventually pivoted back to a business VPN because it actually works across both legacy and modern systems without breaking everything. By handling the network and endpoint security as separate layers, we satisfied the insurance requirements without locking ourselves out of our clients tech.\n\nWhen we compared our options, PureVPN for Teams stood out for multi-client legacy access and was easy for compliance. NordLayer was fine for basic remote access, while Perimeter 81 was great for cloud-only teams but had low compatibility for our legacy needs.\n\nIf you handle a mix of client types, do not feel forced into a modern stack that kills your workflow just to pass a review. Has anyone else had to roll back a modern security setup because it did not work with your clients older infrastructure?",

What actually slowed things down wasn’t demand. It was friction. People were interested. They understood the problem. But small process gaps made adoption harder than it needed to be. Confusion around versions. Scattered feedback. Extra steps that didn’t feel obvious until someone tried to use the system in real work. The early lesson wasn’t about marketing. It was about removing tiny points of friction that compound over time. We tend to think startups fail because of big mistakes. In my case, progress slowed because of small inefficiencies.

He wrote a book called “An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth: What Going to Space Taught Me About Ingenuity, Determination, and Being Prepared for Anything”. You need to read this book.\n\nOne thing Chris Hadfield says is that you need to look at a successful person and determine what skills and knowledge they have that lead to that success, and then how you can attain those skills. That’s what reading this book starts.\n\nIt’s not luck. It’s not being really smart magically, nobody is just smart or gifted. It’s not who you know or how much money you have. All of these things can help someone along a path, but that path must be deliberately chosen and developed.\n\nDon’t think people are in their positions because luck or age. Don’t assume you are smarter than people because 100% of the time you aren’t and can learn something from them.\n\nProfessional development > technical skills\nRead 7 habits, how to win friends and influence people, astronauts guide to life on earth, and more. These are the skills that will enable your success. Not every book is 100% right but everyone has something to teach.\n\nKnow your limitations but don’t consider them permanent. There is no ceiling for the hardworking and ambitious.\n\nIf you need a starter mentor, add me and send me a message. I’m not going to tell you how to build a perfect nozzle or what company to buy parts from, but I’ll help you develop into a professional who has the skills to do much more. I am not some weirdo who is looking for payment, just someone who wished they could’ve been given better advice.\n\nHow do you make a rocket startup? A convoluted path that is focused on development rather than a quick answer of “fill out XYZ form.”\n\nIf you are shooting for the stars and only make it halfway, you are still a million times more successful than most people. But that takes work.",

Also, you might not even end up liking the profession!\n\nFocus on the here and now. Ensure you are excelling at life right now— school, socially, financially. Join clubs. Do applicable hobbies. Learn about investing. If you are really into rocketry, play through Kerbal Space Program without many mods. Make sure you read professional development books.\n\nWhen I started school for my engineering undergrad more than half the students dropped out before they even got to the “weeder” classes where even more students dropped out. They weren’t mature enough to handle even slightly hard content. They were told/believed that they were naturally smarter than others and folded like wet paper.\n\nThe most successful engineers I’ve seen are people who have applicable hobbies that started small and worked up/out and they also had broad interests and knowledge. But of all the skills that lead to success, they had interpersonal skills learned via actual effort, research, and training. \n\nChris Hadfields advice to young people is “Don’t just be an astronaut” which means, the highly successful have broad capabilities and interests, but the common thread is extreme interpersonal skills.",

      "text": "Hey. Building a regulated platform where money comes in, sits pending for a bit, then goes out. It is a marketplace plus some subscription flows, so matching references matters. Initial launch is EUR/GBP collections, then we add USD for international payuts, and GCC later with AED and BHD.\n\nFrom the infra side, I care about boring stuff. Consistent IDs between API, webhook, and statements. Clear statuses when something gets returned or stuck. And support that does not go silent when an investigation starts. I have seen teams drown in exceptions because the provider story looks great until month-end close, then it gets ugly fast.\n\nBanking Circle gets mentioned a lot for EU account infrastructure. Lorum is also on the shortlist.\n\nAnyone used either in prod?",

          "text": "One thing that really matters if you care about getting predictable outcomes is what I’ll call an intake to recon flow how easy is it to map an incoming collection event through to settlement with as little human context as possible? The teams that get this right tend to:\n\n* define a canonical reference early in the flow\n* treat webhook payloads as first class sources of truth not notifications\n* model statuses conservatively so pending isn’t confused with done\n\nI’ve also seen tools that mesh visibility into those flows not just dashboards cut down support cycles a lot. For example, with some of the newer AI aligned tracking layers like SyndrAI, the value came from removing ambiguity around what was being tracked and what was out of scope it wasn’t about hype, it was about having a single place to compare API events vs what landed in reporting.",

If your GCC phase is definite and not just a maybe, worth looking at them earlier rather than later since adding AED/BHD through a separate provider later is a pain.",
