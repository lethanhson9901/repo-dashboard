          "text": "I do quite a lot of research about this. I call it the “hallucination spiral”:\n\nYou built something nobody wants, but you do not know it yet. The Hallucination begins with conviction that feels like vision. Your early adopters are enthusiasts, friends of friends, people who will try anything new. You mistake their curiosity for demand. You raise a Series A on the story of what this could become, and the capital lets you avoid the truth for another two years. The 189 companies in this pattern burned $14.2 billion before admitting the market did not exist.\n\nAs the hallucination persists, you encounter The Math Problem. To manufacture demand where none exists organically, you pour money into customer acquisition. Your CAC climbs while lifetime value stays flat or shrinks. You tell yourself this is investment in growth, that you are buying market share, that unit economics will improve at scale. They do not. The 233 companies caught in unit economics failures burned $99.7 billion learning this lesson. You are now bleeding cash to acquire customers who do not really want what you are selling, in a market that may not exist at the scale you need.\n\nThe cascade ends at The Bonfire. You have spent years and tens of millions proving that your market thesis was wrong and your unit economics never worked. The 182 companies in this pattern burned $281.2 billion, the highest total of any failure mode, because they had enough capital to die slowly. Your median lifespan is 4 years. You will have multiple rounds of layoffs, several pivots that each burn another six months, and a final scrambling fundraise that fails because investors can see the pattern even if you cannot. The Hallucination Spiral kills slowly enough that you will remember every month of it. [source](https://www.loot-drop.io/why-they-fail)",

      "text": "Building Fog of Mind: practical mental health support for high-pressure UK workplaces (NHS, education, construction)\n\nI’m John, UK-based, ex-British Army and now a risk manager. I built **Fog of Mind** after my own run-in with depression and years of watching capable people go quiet, burn out, or break, usually long before anyone calls it “a mental health issue”.\n\n# The problem I can’t unsee (and the numbers back it up)\n\nThese are three sectors where stress is not a footnote, it’s baked into the job:\n\n* **NHS:** In the NHS Staff Survey 2024, **41.63%** of staff said they felt unwell due to work-related stress, and **55.77%**reported going to work despite not feeling well enough to do their duties. ([nhsstaffsurveys.com](https://www.nhsstaffsurveys.com/static/c1a573e95b1a49428676ef4b24f5efe7/National-Results-Briefing-2024.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n* **UK education:** Education Support’s Teacher Wellbeing Index reports **77%** of education staff experience symptoms of poor mental health due to work, and **49%** say workplace culture negatively affects their mental health. ([educationsupport.org.uk](https://www.educationsupport.org.uk/resources/for-organisations/research/teacher-wellbeing-index/))\n* **UK construction:** Construction workers have been reported as being at **3.7x higher** risk of suicide than the national average (citing ONS), with evidence also pointing to **507 suicides in construction in 2021**. ([Mates in Mind](https://www.matesinmind.org/news/mental-health-in-uk-construction-the-statistics?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\nZoom out and it’s not just a “wellbeing” issue, it’s a productivity and stability issue: in Great Britain, **40.1 million working days** are lost due to work-related illness and injury, with an estimated **£22.9bn** cost (2023/24). ([HSE](https://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/overview.htm))\n\n# Why this feels urgent (and why I’m building a startup around it)\n\nBecause the current pattern is predictable:\n\n1. people struggle silently\n2. performance drops, relationships fray, absence increases\n3. the “support” arrives late, or not at all\n\nA lot of workplace mental health support is either too generic, too reactive, or too divorced from real working life. Fog of Mind is built around **early, practical intervention**: simple tools, conversation prompts, and routines that help people create headspace before things hit crisis level. It’s **not therapy**, and it doesn’t pretend to be.\n\n# What I’m looking for from the startup community\n\nIf you’ve built or scaled something in a regulated, people-heavy space (health, education, construction, HR), I’d value input on:\n\n* the fastest route to **first pilots** without getting trapped in procurement cycles\n* whether to start with **SMEs** (especially construction) vs going straight at enterprise/public sector\n* what you’ve found works for **pricing** practical workshops + ongoing support (without selling “wellbeing theatre”)\n\n.",

          "text": "Hi John, I think Fog of Mind is a great idea. The following is my take on the entire thing\n\n1. If you are pushing this towards business, the primary idea needs to shift from well-being, to impacts on their business due to a quantifiable change in well-being( risk reduction). Then possibly push wellbeing as a second part.\n\n2. I would recommend SMEs to go with, your background and experiences would work in your favour in pushing the change. Additionally,  you could also take a look at sectors that would easily adopt what you have; it is likely that there is going to be some \"cultural\" resistance to the entire concept of well-being.\n\n3. Pilots needn't be perfect for you, but I think they would need to be fast. Say 2-3 paid pilots, some testimonials and most definitely before and after data. You also use this to farm urgency.\n\n4. As for the pricing, it is imperative in my opinion that you don't price yourself on the lower end of the spectrum. It might be easier to sell initially but once you ramp up operations it will come to bite back at you.\n\nAgain these are just my thoughts on it, hopefully this helps you out in some capacity.\n\nAnd Best of Luck!",

          "text": "We’ve built a number of projects and applications for the medical sector (for example, [Mysti AI](https://lexogrine.com/success-stories/mystiai)). Many of them were startups, and their access to the market was fairly limited. The main challenges founders ran into were significant legal complexity and strict requirements around processing medical data (by definition, the most sensitive category of data), long, and sometimes very long, procurement cycles on the enterprise side, and often a certain reluctance to adopt new solutions.\n\nBased on that experience, I’d suggest starting with mid-sized organizations (10+, or even 50+ employees). Their budgets are typically large enough to make room for buying new solutions, their teams are big enough that chronic stress and burnout already meaningfully impact overall organizational performance, and their willingness to adopt innovation is often still high because they usually don’t have “ossified” processes. In large enterprises, even a small change can have major downstream consequences, so they are often less eager to introduce change.\n\nAn SMB customer base also helps you build experience and a track record that should make it easier to win enterprise clients later.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nFast iteration will be critical, because the market is highly competitive right now and you need to test multiple approaches to land on the best offer. At the same time, AI creates room for more flexibility, meaning you can deliver functionality that is more tailored to each client. Still, a human supervisor for the code will remain essential given the sensitivity of the data. I wouldn’t trust approaches like “vibe coding” in this context.",

      "text": "I’ve realized the hard way that my biggest hurdle isn’t the code… it’s the distribution. I spent 3 months building in total silence, and when I finally launched, it was absolute silence. I know the fix is building in public but the sheer overhead is killing my productivity.   \n  \nI am trying to find a way to consistently produce and repurpose content to stay active on LinkedIn for investors, X (Twitter) for the tech community, and now Instagram/YouTube for brand personality. By the time I’ve tailored the founder journey content for each platform's vibe, I’ve lost half a day of deep work. As a solo founder, I can’t afford to be a full-time Social Media Manager, but I also can't afford to be invisible. What’s your workflow for staying visible across multiple channels without losing your focus on the product?",

What worked, what didn’t, what made you want to throw something at the wall. The images should be screenshots or videos of something real, not bs posters made with canva. \nUse the “build in public” trend and use an open source social media scheduling tool to post 1-2 a week about this journey, always framing it around the problem you identified and how you propose to solve it. \nAvoid writing the posts with ChatGPT. Mistakes, weird cadence and honesty always wins. Don’t include links in the post body, always in the comments on your posts. \n\nHope this helps",
