          "text": "I do quite a lot of research about this. I call it the “hallucination spiral”:\n\nYou built something nobody wants, but you do not know it yet. The Hallucination begins with conviction that feels like vision. Your early adopters are enthusiasts, friends of friends, people who will try anything new. You mistake their curiosity for demand. You raise a Series A on the story of what this could become, and the capital lets you avoid the truth for another two years. The 189 companies in this pattern burned $14.2 billion before admitting the market did not exist.\n\nAs the hallucination persists, you encounter The Math Problem. To manufacture demand where none exists organically, you pour money into customer acquisition. Your CAC climbs while lifetime value stays flat or shrinks. You tell yourself this is investment in growth, that you are buying market share, that unit economics will improve at scale. They do not. The 233 companies caught in unit economics failures burned $99.7 billion learning this lesson. You are now bleeding cash to acquire customers who do not really want what you are selling, in a market that may not exist at the scale you need.\n\nThe cascade ends at The Bonfire. You have spent years and tens of millions proving that your market thesis was wrong and your unit economics never worked. The 182 companies in this pattern burned $281.2 billion, the highest total of any failure mode, because they had enough capital to die slowly. Your median lifespan is 4 years. You will have multiple rounds of layoffs, several pivots that each burn another six months, and a final scrambling fundraise that fails because investors can see the pattern even if you cannot. The Hallucination Spiral kills slowly enough that you will remember every month of it. [source](https://www.loot-drop.io/why-they-fail)",

We recently tried moving our team to ZTNA and SASE to check those boxes, but it turned into a massive headache because of our client mix.\n\nThe reality is that a lot of our clients in finance and older industries still rely on legacy environments and on-prem servers. Most of the shiny new Zero Trust tools are built for cloud-native start-ups and they just do not play nice with these older setups. We actually found ourselves in a spot where the very tools meant to make us compliant were stopping us from accessing the environments we needed to bill hours.\n\nWe eventually pivoted back to a business VPN because it actually works across both legacy and modern systems without breaking everything. By handling the network and endpoint security as separate layers, we satisfied the insurance requirements without locking ourselves out of our clients tech.\n\nWhen we compared our options, PureVPN for Teams stood out for multi-client legacy access and was easy for compliance. NordLayer was fine for basic remote access, while Perimeter 81 was great for cloud-only teams but had low compatibility for our legacy needs.\n\nIf you handle a mix of client types, do not feel forced into a modern stack that kills your workflow just to pass a review. Has anyone else had to roll back a modern security setup because it did not work with your clients older infrastructure?",

Scaling from 10 to 60 in a year is a massive win, but we know exactly what you mean about that informal workflow hitting its breaking point.\n\nAt that size, the shift from knowing what everyone is doing to feeling like you have zero visibility is a common pain point for startups. However, we found that lean, hyper-growth teams often rebel against screenshot monitoring or active tracking because it can erode trust just when you need the team to be most autonomous. Our \"stop the bleeding\" move was focusing on outcome-based visibility rather than activity tracking. Instead of looking at screenshots, we moved toward a system where progress is visible through structured, async updates that clearly show project velocity. This gives you the oversight you need without the \"Big Brother\" vibe or the heavy enterprise price tag.\n\nWe are a Kiwi startup ourselves, and we built Ripple to solve this exact mess by unifying updates, tasks, and decisions into one clear feed. It helps you keep high-level visibility on progress across your 60-person team without needing to monitor their screens.\n\nHow are you thinking about balancing the need for oversight with maintaining your team culture as you continue to scale?",

Confusion around versions. Scattered feedback. Extra steps that didn’t feel obvious until someone tried to use the system in real work. The early lesson wasn’t about marketing. It was about removing tiny points of friction that compound over time. We tend to think startups fail because of big mistakes. In my case, progress slowed because of small inefficiencies.

I'm 22 and unemployed, I can't afford to get an office, stuidio or anything of that sort so I'd have to do a business from home but idk about the regulations. \n\nI'm always stuck between product vs service, if product then what can it be and idk a thing about manufacturing so yeah makes no sense. Service? what kind of services, business consulting or a pr firm? I've no clue..I see Saas is trending but I'm not good with tech, idk coding or anything that is related to building softwares or apps. I honestly have this desire to start something but I don't know what!! \n\nI'm not asking for a business idea, but can ppl with experience or even starters just share their thoughts & suggestions for my situation.

You are 22, and what you’re feeling is something I’ve seen in **hundreds of aspiring founders during my 15 years as a mentor** (after 20 years in global multinationals). You are stuck in the **'Circle of Limbo'**: overthinking the destination before even taking the first step. Here is the raw truth you won't find in 'hype' SaaS tweets:\n\n1. **Forget the 'Genius Idea':** Most successful businesses are built on 'boring' problems, not revolutionary inventions. Don't look for an idea; look for a person with a problem they are willing to pay to solve.\n2. **Service > Product (for now):** Since you have no capital and no tech skills, **start with a service**. It teaches you sales and operations without the cost of manufacturing.\n3. **The 'Frankenstein' Trap:** You’re worried about offices and regulations before you even have a single customer. That’s how you build a 'Frankenstein'—a structure with no soul. Your 'office' is your laptop.\n\nIn my book, **'StartUp Inferno'**, I explain that the deepest circle of failure is **Denial**. Don't deny your reality: you are an apprentice. Find a local business, offer to solve a specific problem for them, and start there.\n\nWhat is one skill you have right now that a 50-year-old business owner might struggle with?",

That is where good product ideas come from.\n\nThe real question is not whether you have the idea. It is whether you have the stomach to hear “no” today and still pick up the phone and continue your outreach tomorrow. Selling is the first skill. Everything else comes later.\n\nYou can always partner with the right people once you know what truly sells. Start selling what you use.

I’ve read about startups that bought professional barber chairs and book a “private barber” for their employees every few weeks.\n\nOtherwise your co working idea seems reasonable, perhaps there’s some saas to reduce the admin burden.",

      "text": "Hey. Building a regulated platform where money comes in, sits pending for a bit, then goes out. It is a marketplace plus some subscription flows, so matching references matters. Initial launch is EUR/GBP collections, then we add USD for international payuts, and GCC later with AED and BHD.\n\nFrom the infra side, I care about boring stuff. Consistent IDs between API, webhook, and statements. Clear statuses when something gets returned or stuck. And support that does not go silent when an investigation starts. I have seen teams drown in exceptions because the provider story looks great until month-end close, then it gets ugly fast.\n\nBanking Circle gets mentioned a lot for EU account infrastructure. Lorum is also on the shortlist.\n\nAnyone used either in prod?",

The teams that get this right tend to:\n\n* define a canonical reference early in the flow\n* treat webhook payloads as first class sources of truth not notifications\n* model statuses conservatively so pending isn’t confused with done\n\nI’ve also seen tools that mesh visibility into those flows not just dashboards cut down support cycles a lot. For example, with some of the newer AI aligned tracking layers like SyndrAI, the value came from removing ambiguity around what was being tracked and what was out of scope it wasn’t about hype, it was about having a single place to compare API events vs what landed in reporting.",
