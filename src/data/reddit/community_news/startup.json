      "text": "I see a lot of posts here celebrating wins related to landing new customers, which is awesome, but you are leaving money on the table (because I sure have) if you are only optimizing and focusing on net new lands or raising prices on them.                               \n\nI've been building Answer HQ, a customer support SaaS, the past year. \n\nLast week, I asked my existing customers, who on average spend between $200-$300 a month, if they would like to add more seats to their assistant so their team doesn't need to share just one account. \n\nTo my surprise, within the first hour of me asking that question, three companies replied yes, they needed more seats. I know this sounds totally made up, but if you DM me, I can send you screenshots of the conversation. It surprised me too.                                              \n\nSo bro, I've had these larger customers for over a year now, and it turns out they all needed more seats, and I could have been making at minimum 10% more per customer. I just literally needed to ask the question. \n\nI never thought to upsell them this way. I'm a fucking idiot. \n\nI will be charging them $20/mo/seat, and it was an instant upsell that increased the revenue for all three accounts in less than an hour by 10%.                                  \n\nSo yeah. Don't just focus on net new customers. Focus on landing & expanding and upselling to existing customers. You don't need to just rely on increasing prices. The side benefit to upselling is that it helps with churn. It won't fix high churn, but it helps with the small leaks.             \n\nIf you're building a B2B SaaS, what other ways have you experimented with to increase revenue for existing customers? What value were you trying to drive? ",

Shared accounts are annoying, risky, and they quietly cap adoption, so seats is an easy yes when the team is growing.\n\nOther ways to expand in B2B support tools without feeling salesy:\n\nCharge on outcomes or usage that maps to value, like volume, channels, automations, AI assisted resolutions, knowledge base coverage.\n\nOffer add ons that reduce operational pain, onboarding help, integrations support, priority support, quarterly workflow reviews.\n\nAdd manager level features as a higher tier, reporting, QA, coaching, audit trails, because that pulls in a second buyer inside the account.\n\nUse product triggers when you detect shared logins or multiple agents, so the expansion ask feels like a natural prompt, not a cold email.\n\nWhat was the main driver for those three customers.

              "text": "My 2 cents (background: I run a B2B SaaS )\n\nWe used to charge customers for integration and onboarding, as two separate line items. We used to get a lot of push back on the integration fee but never on onboarding. \n\nI realized that's because as soon as I charge for onboarding, in teh customer's frame of reference, I now own the KPI of change management; to ensure people use the product and adopt it soon enough.\n\nWhereas when it comes to the integration free, the customer's frame of reference is that this should be part of the product; if you have an integration I should get that for free.\n\nSo what changed? Now, we offer integration for free but charge decently well for onboarding & setup, and customers pay that happily.  We get covered for the effort we put in, without losing on the perceived value.\n\nRecently, we also noticed there is significant churn in our industry and teams need to be retrained on our software (usually every 5-6 months). Earlier, retraining on our software was a casual excercise that happened internally, but no one owned it as a metric. Now that we charge for it, customers are happy to shift that KPI to us.\n\nThis ties back to your point on removing the friction component. I think customers are happy to pay, we just dont show enough value.",

You should analyse your database to find the exact usage threshold that signals a need for more capacity.",

About 20 years ago, I had an idea for a social media website (sorry don’t want to give too much info away) while I was college and tried to learn as much web development as I could (design and database) and after awhile I just gave up as I had no connections to anyone in the development world and just gave up. Fast forward to today, with the help of Claude and Codex and about 6 months of time, I have the site just about fully working beyond just a proof of concept. I know people always feel confident about their ideas and whatnot, but this site has potential to make money from day one and the more people use it the more money it could generate. I’m about as new to the startup world as you can get and looking for any advice I can to see how I can either find funding from investors, to perhaps try to keep going and get this idea off the ground myself? As I'm the only one navigating this path, I have so many questions but I’m finding it tough to find a course that will educate me to even ask the questions I need if that makes sense. Again my apologies for the lack of details as far as the site goes, but I'm just trying not to get burned. thank you in advance. I'm located in Boston if that help :-)",

Honestly, most first-time founders don’t get that far before giving up.\n\nAt this stage, the most important thing is just getting people to use it and seeing how they react. Even a small group of active users can prove that your idea has traction and help you figure out what works and what doesn’t. Networking is also really important. You don’t have to know everyone in tech, but meeting other founders, going to local meetups in Boston, or joining online startup communities can open doors for advice, partnerships, and eventually funding.\n\nSince you’re new to fundraising, it helps to start simple. Try putting together a one-page pitch that explains the problem you’re solving, how your product does it, who it’s for, and any traction you already have. Even if it’s just a few users, showing that people are actually using your product speaks volumes to investors. You could also consider bootstrapping at first if your site can make money early, because showing revenue makes it much easier to attract investment later.",

I guess that's where I need guidance and advice. In all honestly I don't feel the idea of the site and whether is good or bad is the question, its about I have a site and I don't know what the next steps are to get close to launch if that makes sense?   I currently have a pitch deck, one sheet and business plan that I've worked quite a bit on.

The discount makes the entry price very attractive, but you are basically locking yourself into their ecosystem for a couple of years. If your project is simple, like a blog, portfolio, or small business site, it usually works out fine and saves money upfront.\n\nWhere people get disappointed is when their needs grow. Scaling, advanced support, or custom setups can feel limiting compared to higher end hosts. So in my view, the discount is worth it only if you know exactly what you are building and do not expect major changes soon. Otherwise, the cheap price can turn into regret later when renewal time hits or you want to move.",

Anything else is not just a distraction, it's a risk, \"what if that's wrong.\"\n\nStartup communities, and in my 30 years working with startups, are flush with investors and experienced founders saying, \"I don't care how good it looks! Ship it!!\" while business plan people, designers, product people, pitch deck creators, tend to push that their work is critical (i.e. \"How it looks is critical\")\n\nI can count on the hundreds, how many startups failed because the team was fixated on the quality of the UX, design of the pitch deck, etc., and were blind to if it was actually any good, worked, and got released.\n\nPoint being, I stopped supporting that design internship program because they'd come up with great ideas and beautiful things, but at the end of the day, we'd then say, \"great, build it,\" and they wouldn't do anything else for you.\n\nRespectfully, because I know you've been taught or believe otherwise, but we don't need design, we need build.\n\nCraigslist and Wikipedia thrived for decades while people built better looking things.\n\nAnd so internships are even more challenging because while we're trying to get shit done, you're seeking to learn, and design, and take up time and attention to do so.... While we need it built and released.\n\nTake that for what it's worth. Get it shipped or you're not what startups are seeking.",

      "text": "“If we paid for it, we own it.”\n\nOn the surface, that statement feels reasonable because it matches how most people think about buying something: money changes hands, the work gets delivered, and ownership transfers cleanly from one side to the other.\n\nBut anyone who has actually delivered IT projects at scale knows the reality is far more layered, because most teams are not building everything from scratch for every engagement, and they cannot afford to if they want to ship quickly, price competitively, and maintain quality.\n\nBehind almost every “custom build” sits an ecosystem of existing frameworks, internal libraries, deployment scripts, templates, boilerplate modules, and tooling that existed long before a particular client ever entered the picture.\n\nThose assets are not shortcuts in the lazy sense. They are the delivery engine.\n\n**### Where Contracts Flatten the Most Important Nuance**\n\nThe problem usually starts with one sentence that looks harmless when the relationship is healthy:\n\n“All deliverables belong to the client.”\n\nThat clause rarely causes conflict while things are going well, because during delivery everyone is focused on progress, timelines, and getting to the finish line. But contracts are not really interpreted during good times. They get interpreted when something becomes uncomfortable, when a deadline slips, when a handover becomes tense, or when someone on the client side starts asking for “everything” as part of closure.\n\nOnce that clause is read literally, reusable components start getting treated like bespoke IP that was created specifically for the project. Internal tooling is assumed to be part of the handover. Build scripts, deployment automation, templates, and even general-purpose modules that you use across multiple clients start getting pulled into the client’s ownership expectations, even though none of those items were scoped, priced, or intended to leave your environment.\n\nAnd when you try to explain the distinction later, it rarely lands as a reasonable boundary. It often lands as “you’re withholding what we already paid for,” which is where relationships start to strain even when nobody is acting in bad faith.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that ownership is not implied by effort, timelines, or invoices paid. Ownership is created by what the agreement clearly defines, and anything left vague will eventually be interpreted in the way that benefits the party who is demanding more.\n\nIf you do not separate what is built specifically for the client from what powers your business internally, you end up giving away leverage without noticing it in the moment. Each vague clause makes the next project harder to price because you lose the ability to reuse what you have already built. Each unclear handover expectation chips away at your standardisation, your delivery speed, and your ability to scale without burning out your team.\n\nOver time, this stops being a one-off misunderstanding and becomes a structural business problem, because you start hesitating to invest in better internal tooling when there is a risk that every improvement will later be treated as client-owned property.\n\n**### How IT Teams Fix This Without Making It Adversarial**\n\nThe fix is not aggressive language or defensive behaviour. The fix is practical clarity that removes ambiguity before it becomes emotional.\n\nStrong agreements define categories of IP in plain terms, so there is a clear separation between:\n\na) what is custom-developed for the client during the engagement, and\n\nb) what already existed before the project began, including your internal libraries, frameworks, scripts, templates, and know-how.\n\nWhere ownership does not make commercial sense, the contract should grant a license instead, so the client can use what they need to operate the deliverables without turning your internal engine into their asset.\n\nJust as importantly, the agreement should clearly state what gets handed over at the end of the project and what does not, because handovers are where misunderstandings tend to surface first.\n\nAnd pricing needs to match those boundaries, because clients are rarely upset about limits when those limits were visible upfront and reflected in the commercial structure, rather than introduced after delivery when they already feel entitled to everything.\n\n**### Final Thoughts**\n\nPaying for development does not automatically mean owning everything behind it. When contracts fail to separate custom work from pre-existing IP, IT teams quietly give away leverage, create avoidable friction, and make future delivery harder than it needs to be.\n\nGood contracts do not slow teams down. They protect the engine that makes delivery possible.\n\nWhen ownership is clear from the start, projects stay focused on outcomes instead of arguments, and teams grow sustainably without accidentally giving their business away one vague clause at a time.[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1qugnjt)",
