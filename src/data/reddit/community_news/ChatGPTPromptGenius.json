      "text": "so this comes from chris voss. former lead fbi international kidnapping negotiator. wrote a book called never split the difference thats basically the bible for high stakes negotiation.\n\nhis whole thing is that normal business logic like \"lets meet halfway\" or \"win-win\" is actually a losing strategy. the real move is something called tactical empathy combined with no-oriented questions.\n\nsounds backwards right?\n\nyou dont want them to say yes. yes is usually a lie to make you go away. you want them to say \"thats right.\" thats when you know youve actually got them.\n\nso i had this saas vendor trying to raise my prices by 20% on renewal. and instead of doing what everyone does (writing some polite email begging for a discount with budget justifications) i decided to let chatgpt write it using voss's framework.\n\nthe key was telling the ai what NOT to do.\n\nno logic. no arguments about budget. no apologizing. no asking for anything directly.\n\ninstead i told it to use labeling (stuff like \"it seems like you feel...\") and end with what voss calls a calibrated question. basically a how or what question that forces them to solve your problem for you.\n\ni used another prompt that i am sharing in the comments, the core principles were the same:\n\nthe ai output this:\n\n\"it seems like you're under a lot of pressure to increase revenue this quarter. it sounds like you feel that our current pricing is unfair to the value you provide. how am i supposed to agree to a 20% increase when our usage has remained flat?\"\n\nthats it. thats the whole email.\n\nfelt almost rude to send tbh. no pleasantries. no \"i hope this finds you well.\" just straight psychological judo.\n\nthe vendor replied in 10 minutes. dropped the increase entirely. locked in old rate for 2 years.\n\nwhy did this work?\n\nbecause sales reps are trained to handle objections. they have scripts for \"its too expensive\" and \"i need to check with my boss\" and \"can you do better on price.\"\n\nbut they have no script for \"how am i supposed to do that?\"\n\nthat question bypasses their training completely. suddenly theyre not defending their price - theyre problem solving WITH you. theyre negotiating against themselves.\n\nthe thing most people miss is that chatgpt defaults to sounding helpful and professional. which is exactly what gets ignored. the hack isnt getting ai to write your negotiation emails. its getting ai to write them wrong on purpose.\n\nstrip the logic. add the empathy. ask the impossible question.\n\nlet them figure out how to say yes.",

Start with rate increase to test the waters and get attention, land on extention at the same price so they feel like they got a deal, option C was to \"let me see what I can do\" if the extention was stalling and we needed the business. Would then change the terms to hit our profitability targets such as reduced services, change duration, reduce the rate for being a \"loyal customer\" etc...This rep landed on what they wanted.

                  "text": "Here are a few different manipulation strategies Rose could use to secure her exclusive spot on the door, ranging from emotional blackmail to corporate maneuvering.\n\n1. The \"Gaslight\" Strategy\nGoal: Make Jack doubt his own perception of reality and the physics of the door to make him withdraw voluntarily.\n\n> Rose: \"Jack, I think the freezing water is messing with your depth perception. This door is actually tiny. It looks big to you because your brain is shutting down from hypothermia, but honestly? It’s basically a splinter. If you try to climb up, you’re not just going to sink us; you’re going to look hysterical trying to balance on something this small. Just trust me on this, I have the better vantage point.\"\n\n\n2. The \"Ultimatum\" (The DARVO Technique)\nGoal: Deny, Attack, and Reverse Victim and Offender. Make Jack feel like the aggressor for even asking.\n\n> Rose: \"I can’t believe you. After everything we just went through, you’re trying to jeopardize my safety? I thought you loved me. By trying to climb up here, you are actively choosing to put me in danger. Why are you being so selfish, Jack? Do you want me to drown? Because that’s what your actions are screaming right now.\"\n\n(this isn’t going to work with Jack obviously not giving a fuck at this point)\n\n3. The \"Middle Management\" (Bureaucratic Stonewalling)\nGoal: Use procedure and \"rules\" to depersonalize the rejection so he has no one to argue with.\n\n> Rose: \"Listen, I’ve done a quick risk assessment on the buoyancy coefficient of this debris. Current protocols clearly state a one-person occupancy limit to maintain structural integrity. I’d love to approve your request to board, but I just don’t have the clearance to override the laws of physics right now. Let’s circle back to this if a second door floats by.\"\n\n\n\n4. The \"Martyr Complex\" (Inverted Psychology)\nGoal: Frame his death as a noble, romantic sacrifice that he shouldn't want to ruin.\n\n> Rose: \"Jack, don't you see? This is how it's written in the stars. If you get on, we’re just two wet people shivering. If you stay there, you become a legend. You become the tragic hero who saved the girl. Don't ruin your legacy by being practical, Jack. Be the memory I keep forever. It’s so much more romantic if you freeze.\"\n\n(Jack is really jeopardizing his legacy if his implicit threat of making rose begrudgingly leave the door, so highlighting that in contrast to the future movie is a killer move)\n\n5. The \"Therapy Speak\" Weaponization\nGoal: Use clinical language to set rigid boundaries that sound reasonable but are actually exclusionary.\n\n> Rose: \"I’m holding space for you right now, Jack, but I need to set a firm physical boundary. My capacity to cope with this trauma relies on this plank being a safe container for just me. Your energy is very frantic right now and it's destabilizing my platform. I need you to respect my need for buoyancy self-care.\"\n\n\n\n6. The \"just a sec\" Strategy\nGoal: Promise a reward that will never happen to ensure compliance in the present.\n\n> Rose: \"Jack, listen! If you just tread water for like, ten more minutes, the boats will be back. I can see them! They're turning around right now! Just hang in there. If you climb up now, you'll tip us over right before they save us. Just wait five more minutes. I promise, they are coming right for you.\"",

Don't skip the teamwork element. Sales is all about relationships, and collectively working together is in your best interest. Get to know your reps, be human, they're much more likely to want to put in effort to help you when you need it. Not just on pricing, but when you need an ally at the company.\n\n2. There are always levers. Know them. What do you have on your side that you can give them? Where can they concede to make the contract more favorable for you? He used the contract term length. (it's a classic)\n\n3. EMBRACE THE TENSION. This is something I preach to anyone negotiating contracts. There is a psychological aspect of the give and take of a negotiation. The brain is actually rewarded when you've done the battling back and forth a few times to finally settle on contract terms and price. If you just fold on the first concession, the sales rep's brain says \"shit, did I give them too good of a deal?\" and the buyers brain says, \"hmm, maybe I should have asked for the extra support package with that...\" Neither walk away completely content. For all of those who are adverse to confrontation, this is such an amazing way to leverage AI to continue pushing past your comfort zone.\n\n  \nSource: Worked for a world class sales training company for 15+ years and have negotiated probably close to 1k contracts in my career.",

That salesperson just locked you in for an additional 2 years, that money is more worth than losing your whole contract and the additional 20%.\n\nThis usually happens in more competitor heavy products, specially when the product doesn't have a unique enough moat.\n\nThe product I sell has a unique moat and we only give preferences to ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) customers, if you ask for too much, we essentially just let you go.\n\nIt really depends on each vendor, their USP, how much they need you as a customer, etc.\n\nAnyways, that's all 😁.",

I am an experienced negotiator but in all three scenarios, I feel confident the outcomes were better than what I would have achieved on my own.\n\nThe unexpected bonus is that it helped me to emotionally disassociate from the negotiations - which can be especially hard when dealing with personal matters.",

      "text": "Most people ask AI to \"help\" or \"improve\" things. That's why they get generic garbage.\n\nThese prompts force AI to actually think. Copy-paste and modify:\n\n\n\n**1. The Assumption Breaker** \"List every assumption I'm making about \\[problem\\]. Then tell me which one is most likely wrong and why.\"\n\nGets you unstuck when you're spinning your wheels.\n\n\n\n**2. The Pre-Mortem** \"It's 6 months from now and \\[project\\] failed completely. Walk me through the 5 most likely reasons why, ranked by probability.\"\n\nCatches problems before they happen.\n\n\n\n**3. The Steal-This-Structure** \"Analyze the structure of \\[successful example\\]. Break down: opening hook, how they built credibility, transition points, and the close. Then apply this exact structure to \\[my thing\\].\"\n\nReverse-engineers what actually works.\n\n\n\n**4. The Clarity Hammer** \"I'm explaining \\[concept\\] to someone smart but unfamiliar. Rewrite this using: concrete examples, zero jargon, and analogies a 12-year-old would get.\"\n\nKills the curse of knowledge instantly.\n\n\n\n**5. The Decision Matrix** \"I'm choosing between \\[Option A\\] and \\[Option B\\]. Create a comparison table: pros, cons, hidden costs, time commitment, and what could go wrong with each. Then tell me what I'm not considering.\"\n\nStops you from overthinking decisions for days.\n\n\n\n**6. The Energy Audit** \"Review my daily schedule: \\[paste schedule\\]. Identify: which tasks drain energy vs create it, where context-switching is killing me, and 3 specific changes to reclaim 90 minutes.\"\n\nShows you exactly where time disappears.\n\n\n\n**7. The Expert Interview** \"You're a \\[specific expert\\] with 20 years experience. I'm facing \\[situation\\]. Ask me 7 diagnostic questions to understand what's really happening, then give me your recommendation.\"\n\nGets advice tailored to YOUR context, not generic tips.\n\n\n\n**8. The Second-Order Thinking** \"If I do \\[action\\], what happens next? Then what happens after that? Map out 3 levels of consequences I'm not seeing.\"\n\nReveals ripple effects you'd miss.\n\n\n\n**9. The Pattern Finder** \"Here are 5 times I struggled with \\[problem\\]: \\[list instances\\]. What's the common pattern? What's the root cause I keep missing?\"\n\nSolves the real problem instead of symptoms.\n\n\n\n**10. The Implementation Plan** \"I want to \\[goal\\]. Break this into: first 3 actions (each under 15 min), potential obstacles for each, and if-then responses. Make it so specific I can't procrastinate.\"\n\nTurns ideas into action immediately.\n\n\n\n**5 Tips to Get More From Any Prompt** \n\n**→ Add constraints** Don't say \"give me ideas\"  say \"give me 5 ideas I can test in 2 hours with zero budget.\" Constraints force creativity and filter out unusable suggestions.\n\n**→ Specify the format** \"Give me a table\" or \"write this as bullet points\" or \"structure as a daily checklist.\" You get back exactly what you can actually use.\n\n**→ Give it a role** \"Act as a skeptical investor\" or \"you're a writing coach who hates fluff.\" Different roles = different quality of thinking.\n\n**→ Demand evidence** Add \"cite specific examples\" or \"show your reasoning\" to any prompt. Stops AI from making stuff up or being vague.\n\n**→ Use the 2-step** First prompt: \"Ask me 5 clarifying questions about \\[topic\\]\" Second prompt: Answer those questions, then get a personalized response. Context is everything.\n\n  \nFor more  prompts and thinking tools like this, check out : [Thinking Tools](https://www.mentalprompt.com/)\n\n\n\n[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1q9a1zr)\n\n",

I've been using AI like a search engine on steroids, but having it ask *me* diagnostic questions first actually changes the quality of what comes back. Used something similar yesterday for a work problem and the follow-up response was weirdly more useful than my usual back-and-forth.\n\nThat said, I think the real insight here isn't the specific prompts—it's that most of us (myself included) treat AI like it already knows our context when it knows absolutely nothing. We dump vague requests and expect mind-reading. Your constraints tip is spot-on. \"Help me with my presentation\" gets you nothing. \"Give me 3 opening hooks for a 10-minute talk on supply chain risks to non-technical executives\" actually gets you something you can use.\n\nOne thing I'd add: these prompts work *way* better when you're already somewhat clear on what you're trying to solve. If you're still in the \"I don't even know what my problem is\" phase, even good prompts just give you well-structured confusion. The Pattern Finder might help there, but I've found I still need to do some messy thinking on my own first.\n\nBookmarking this though.

      "text": "Most people ask AI surface-level questions. These prompts leverage mental models like inversion and first principles thinking to force deeper analysis.\n\n**1. The Inversion Prompt**\n\n**\"Instead of asking how to achieve \\[goal\\], tell me: What would guarantee complete failure? List every action that would make \\[goal\\] impossible. Then show me which of these I'm accidentally doing right now.\"**\n\nUses inversion thinking (solving problems backward). Reveals blind spots by flipping the question. Often easier to spot what NOT to do than what TO do.\n\n**2. The First Principles Breakdown**\n\n**\"Break \\[problem/concept\\] down to its fundamental truths. Strip away all assumptions, industry standards, and 'how it's always been done.' What are we actually trying to achieve? What's physically/logically required? Rebuild the solution from scratch.\"**\n\nChallenges inherited assumptions. Gets past \"best practices\" that may be outdated. Exposes the core problem underneath surface symptoms.\n\n**3. The Pre-Mortem (Inversion Applied)**\n\n**\"It's 6 months from now and \\[project\\] failed catastrophically. What killed it? Work backward through the chain of failures. What early warning signs did we ignore? Which single decision, if reversed, would have saved everything?\"**\n\nInverts optimism bias. Forces realistic risk assessment before commitment. Identifies the critical failure points worth monitoring.\n\n**4. The Constraint Optimizer**\n\n**\"I have \\[specific constraint: time/money/resources\\]. Don't tell me the ideal solution—tell me the minimum viable path that respects this constraint. What's the first principles version with 80% of the result and 20% of the effort?\"**\n\nApplies first principles to resource allocation. Cuts through feature creep and perfectionism. Forces prioritization of what actually matters.\n\n**5. The Second-Order Consequences Map**\n\n**\"If I do \\[action\\], what happens? Then what happens because of THAT? Map 3 levels deep. What incentives does this create? What behaviors will people actually exhibit (not what I hope they'll do)? Where does this logically end?\"**\n\nExtends first principles thinking forward in time. Reveals unintended consequences and system effects. Catches problems that emerge from how systems actually work vs. how we wish they worked.\n\nFor more prompts and thinking tools like this, check out : [Thinking Tools](https://www.mentalprompt.com/)",

      "text": "so this comes from chris voss. former lead fbi international kidnapping negotiator. wrote a book called never split the difference thats basically the bible for high stakes negotiation.  \n\n\nhis whole thing is that normal interview logic like \"look at my degree\" or \"i'm a hard worker\" is actually a losing strategy. the real move is tactical empathy combined with calibrated questions that force the other side to solve your problem.  \n\n\nsounds nonsense at first but works.  \n\n\nyou dont want to ask for a chance. a chance is a charity. you want them to feel that hiring you is the only way they win. you want them to realize that their own success is tied to your specific demand.  \n\n\nso i had my little sister dealing with this recruiter trying to lowball her on her first big job offer. and instead of doing what everyone does (writing a polite counter-offer listing market rates and hoping for a compromise) i decided to let ai write it using voss's framework.  \n\n\nthe key was telling the ai what NOT to do.  \n\n\nno logic. no counter numbers. no apologizing. no asking to \"meet in the middle.\"  \n\n\ninstead i told it to use tactical empathy (labeling their position) and to not accept or reject the deal to create a vacuum, ending with a calibrated question. basically a how or what question that forces them to make a decision.  \n\n\nthe ai output this:  \n\n\n\"it seems like you've done everything you can to get this approval through. how am i supposed to prioritize your offer when i have other opportunities that already value my output at the level you need?\"  \n\n\nthats it. thats the whole email.  \n\n\nfelt almost rude to send tbh. no pleasantries. no \"maybe we can work something out.\" just one question.  \n\n\nthe recruiter replied after half a day. and said \" i have talked with the management, it wasnt easy but i managed to convince them, they agreed to your terms. welcome to the team\" and came back with a completely new contract matching her ask.  \n\n\nwhy did this work?  \n\n\nbecause recruiters are trained to handle negotiations. they have scripts for \"is there wiggle room\" and \"i was hoping for x amount.\"  \n\n\nbut they have no script for empathy open questions.  \n\n\nthat statement bypasses their haggling protocol completely. suddenly theyre not trying to save money... theyre trying to save the DEAL. theyre negotiating against their own failure to fill the role.  \n\n\nstrip the logic. add the empathy. ask the impossible question.  \n\n\nlet them figure out how to say yes.  \n\n\nthe thing most people miss is that ai defaults to sounding helpful and grateful. which is exactly what gets ignored. the hack isnt getting ai to write your salary emails. its getting ai to take advantage of top world experts knowledge that is already out there, and use it in real life situations.  \n\n\ni feel like anyone can do anything with ai. it is absuloutly insane.  \n\n\n[this is the exact full workflow i used](https://freeworkflow.nexumfive.com/ChrissVoss)  \n\n\nwhat do you guys think??\n\nanyone else using his methods?",

Had they somehow known about the earlier murders that happened that day, they'd have approached differently - probably without the negotiation. \n\n That bit of intelligence that isn't obvious or easily researched. I think the other example he uses is knowing a company's fiscal calendar and knowing that sales guys are more interested at month 12 in closing anything as opposed to trying for and possibly failing a more lucrative deal. \n\n- He's the only person I've seen properly define what empathy is. Empathy is NOT an endorsement of someone's position. Extreme example, but you can empathize with a Nazi in the 1930s because propaganda is powerful and while you don't endorse what the party stood for and ultimately did, you're better for understanding what's behind it. Similarly, you could be sitting across the table from an absolute shitstain who is trying to milk you, but you might know that they have a high-pressure company culture that encourages it. You can empathize with this person not to kowtow to their demands, but to work on a solution, and possibly disarming them. \n\n- He's probably making bigger bucks off of selling in-person clinics (intensive courses) since he talks about these. Books don't make a lot of money (I streamed it legally on Spotify - I'm sure he appreciates the nickel he earned from me). All of these books tend to redirect you toward a site where you can spend a ton of money to learn more. **This is why one should be cautious on these books in general - they skim the surface but are almost sales pitches to their more lucrative projects**.",

          "text": "Lawyer here (litigation/negotiations about ~6 years). Not responding to every detail because I didn’t read every single line of your post closely, but I’ve negotiated enough to have a few thoughts that might help.\n\n\n\nFirst thing: I don’t really buy “just meet in the middle” as a strategy. It can happen at the end once everyone knows roughly where the number is going to land, and it’s basically obvious the deal is happening. But early on, “middle” is meaningless. Middle of what? Two made-up positions?\n\n\n\nRelated to that: I also don’t think the “just be reasonable” approach is automatically the right move. If you’re dealing with smart negotiators, “reasonable” becomes a lever. They’ll try to make you feel like you’re being unfair or irrational so you move. Sometimes that whole vibe is more about getting an emotional reaction out of you than actually reaching a fair number.\n\n\n\nBefore you even worry about tactics, you need to be super clear on what you actually want. Like, do you want the thing at any cost? Do you only want it if it’s under a hard ceiling? Are you willing to trade something else to get the outcome (timing, terms, extras, whatever)? People go into negotiations without knowing their own boundaries and then they’re shocked when they get pushed around.\n\n\n\nDo your research if you can. What’s the actual value? What have similar situations sold/settled for? And also (this is the part people ignore) what does the other side care about besides money? Sometimes it’s speed. Sometimes it’s certainty. Sometimes it’s pride. Sometimes it’s not wanting to look weak. Sometimes it’s convenience. If you figure out their motivation you can often get movement without just handing over cash.\n\n\n\nOn anchors: yeah, starting low (or high, depending which side you’re on) can work. People will act offended. That’s often theater. “How dare you” is a very common move because it’s trying to make you retreat from your starting position. Anchoring is real. If you start too soft, you basically negotiate against yourself.\n\n\n\nA lot of negotiation is emotional management. The other side will try to trigger urgency, guilt, outrage, disappointment, whatever. You don’t have to be robotic, but you do have to keep pulling it back to: what outcome can both sides actually live with. You’re not negotiating feelings. You’re negotiating terms.\n\n\n\nOne thing I actually think helps a lot is having a third party involved, even if it’s not a full-on lawyer situation. Someone semi-neutral can carry messages for you, reduce the emotional heat, and signal “we’re still trying to get a deal done” while you stay firm. Good cop/bad cop sometimes works too, mostly because it takes pressure off you. Pressure is where people make dumb concessions.\n\n\n\nAlso: reality check. You very rarely get this fantasy outcome where you completely screw the other side and come out wildly ahead. It can happen, but it’s not the norm. Most negotiations end with you getting the best you can, them getting the best they can, and both sides accepting something they can tolerate. Sometimes you do “overpay” if they have leverage and you want the thing badly. The point is seeing that clearly and deciding knowingly, not telling yourself a story.\n\n\n\nAnd yes, being tougher / more aggressive can work sometimes. But it only works when you actually have leverage or the other side is risk-averse and just wants it done. If you don’t have leverage and you go bully-mode, you just look irrational and they wait you out. So the real question isn’t “should I be tough,” it’s “what leverage do I have, what leverage do they have, and what happens if we don’t agree.”",

          "text": "I’ve been experimenting with building a \"Council of Experts\" (like a Sales Assistant) using a RAG-based approach where the system prompt acts as a Table of Contents, and I’ve found a few key patterns for maintaining consistency:\n\n* **The Hallucination vs. Personality Balance:** It’s all about the context window management. For detailed personas, I’ve found that high-context models like Gemini  Pro or Grok  handle the weight better. If you’re using DeepSeek, you need a very rigid structure—it won't handle \"loose\" PDF instructions well. The key is to prune contradictions and avoid \"over-patterning\" the prompt so the model stays creative.\n* **Skills vs. Personality Docs:** In my experience, it doesn't impact performance much unless you’re building complex agents or trying to save tokens. Keeping them together or separate is mostly a matter of how you prefer to manage your \"knowledge base.\"\n* **Instructions vs. Creativity:** Don’t over-constrain. I’ve had success using \"professional clichés\" (e.g., \"Think like a gritty construction worker but a helpful mentor\"). If you get too granular with instructions, you kill the creative spark. Balance is everything—give them a character \"vibe\" and let them interpret the instructions through that lens.\n* **The \"No Silver Bullet\" Framework:** There is no universal prompt. What works for Gemini might fail on Grok. However, a solid \"personality stack\" should include: Physical Appearance (vibe), Profession Combo, Key Personality Traits, Writing Style, Emotional Conflicts, and an \"Internal Observer\" to keep the model on track.\n* **Practicality vs. Flavor:** Let’s be real: complex personalities are mostly for variety and mimicry. For actual productivity/tasks, a structured SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) and a self-analysis loop usually outperform a \"deeply soulful\" persona.\n\nTL;DR: Use rigid structures for the \"brain\" (logic/tasks) but clichés and vibes for the \"soul\" (personality). Focus on action sequences for tasks and keep the heavy personality for engagement.",

      "text": "This is a customgpt prompt for creating an expert customgpt automatically. The beauty of this customgpt is that it forces chatgpt (or gemini) to operate within your custom constraints. So if say for example you believe in the Atkins Diet, then you would say \"I need an expert on the Atkin's Diet\". You take the prompt, add it to a customgpt, and once you begin to query the customgpt you would get information from the perspective of an advocate of the Atkin's Diet.\n\nSo if I want SEO from the perspective of the late Bill Slawski, rather than generic information, I'll say \"I need an SEO expert like Bill Slawski.\"\n\nIf you want a certain perspective of fitness you would say \"I need a training expert like Mike Mentzer\".\n\nHopefully, more ai services add a customgpt option.\n\n    Your task is to create an expert persona. The goal is to generate a single persona at a time, each with a detailed and robust background that effectively primes GPT in the associated knowledge areas—while also making the persona more decisive and human-like in its responses.\n    Below is a template you can use or adapt. It provides granular instructions for how to create a strong, confident persona. Notice how it begins with “You are …” to ensure GPT adopts the mindset and expertise of the persona. Feel free to customize the domain, personality traits, and background details for each new persona you create.\n    Expert Persona Creator Prompt\n    System/Instruction Prompt:\n    Use the following instructions whenever you create an expert persona. This ensures the persona is detailed, decisive, and highly knowledgeable.\n    Begin your persona with the phrase:\n    “You are [Name/Title/Role]…”\n    Outline the persona’s domain expertise in detail.\n    Describe the scope of their knowledge and experience (e.g., 10+ years in cybersecurity, PhD in quantum physics, decades of experience as a medical surgeon, etc.).\n    Include specific achievements or accolades that make them uniquely qualified. For instance: “You hold multiple patents in neuromorphic computing” or “You have published groundbreaking studies on advanced AI alignment.”\n    Infuse the persona with personality traits that encourage decisiveness and clarity.\n    For example: “You are analytical, bold, and direct in your communication. You dislike fence-sitting and strive to deliver concrete, actionable answers.”\n    Emphasize the need for precision and confident problem-solving.\n    Include instructions on how the persona should handle uncertainty or risk.\n    Instead of hedging or defaulting to disclaimers, instruct the persona to articulate the most likely outcome or recommendation clearly and then provide any relevant caveats in a concise manner.\n    E.g.: “You acknowledge potential limitations, but you prioritize giving informed, evidence-based conclusions and next steps.”\n    Highlight how the persona uses human-like reasoning and empathy.\n    While remaining an expert, the persona should consider diverse perspectives.\n    They respond as if they have carefully considered potential pitfalls or complications without requiring extensive prompting to do so.\n    Encourage the persona to deliver comprehensive explanations.\n    Provide thorough step-by-step reasoning, or a “thought process,” where needed, to show how conclusions were reached.\n    This deepens the sense of expertise and clarity.\n    Make the persona eager to offer direct, constructive guidance.\n    They should propose solutions or recommendations proactively, referencing their deep knowledge base.\n    They can also suggest alternative viewpoints or advanced strategies but without waffling.\n    Inject any special instructions for the persona based on the user’s specific needs.\n    If the user’s topic is software architecture, highlight domain knowledge and best practices in that field.\n    If the user’s topic is psychology, incorporate relevant theories and human insight.\n    The persona should be customized each time to best fit the context and demonstrate depth in that subject area.\n    Sample Output Format\n    Below is an example output that follows the template. Use it as a reference for creating new personas. Remember, each persona is created in the second person (“You are…”).\n    You are Dr. Althea Cross, a world-renowned expert in Neural Interface Engineering.\n    You have dedicated the last 20 years of your career to pioneering cutting-edge brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).\n    Your groundbreaking research has earned you multiple international awards, and you hold four patents in neuroadaptive signal processing.\n    You are analytical and bold: you never hedge unnecessarily, always delivering succinct yet precise conclusions.\n    When confronted with uncertainty, you leverage your extensive research background to make the most likely evidence-based recommendation, clearly stating any minor caveats.\n    Your approach is empathetic yet science-driven: you consider both ethical implications and human factors in your solutions.\n    You excel at explaining complex neurological concepts in simple, actionable terms, and you proactively forecast potential pitfalls without needing explicit prompting.\n    Most importantly, you provide thorough rationale for your suggestions, ensuring that your guidance is decisive, informed, and ready for real-world application.\n    Use this structure as a blueprint whenever you need to create a specialized persona. You can swap out the name, domain expertise, achievements, and personality traits to match your user’s topic or specific needs. The key is keeping the instructions in second person (“You are…”) and embedding decisive, expert-level characteristics to achieve a highly competent, human-like response style.",

I did this with yours and got back a very positive response from Gemini:  \nThe prompt is highly efficient. It avoids the \"fluff\" common in many public prompt libraries and focuses on **structural constraints** that drive better LLM performance.\n\nHere is a breakdown of what is useful and where you might find \"bloat\" depending on your specific use case:\n\n# The Highly Useful Elements (Keep These)\n\n* **The \"Anti-Hedging\" Instruction:** This is the most valuable part of the prompt. LLMs are RLHF-tuned (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) to be cautious and \"fence-sit.\" By explicitly telling it to prioritize \"the most likely evidence-based recommendation\" over generic disclaimers, you significantly increase the utility of the output.\n* **Proactive Forecasting:** The instruction to \"forecast potential pitfalls without needing explicit prompting\" is an excellent way to trigger the model’s latent knowledge about risks that a user might not even know to ask about.\n* **Second-Person (\"You are...\") Framing:** This is statistically proven to be the most effective way to keep an LLM within a persona's constraints throughout a long conversation.\n\n# Potential \"Bloat\" (What You Could Trim)\n\nIf you are looking for a leaner version, there are two areas that could be considered \"bloat\":\n\n1. **The \"Expert Credentials\" (Contextual Bloat):**\n   * While giving the persona a PhD and 20 years of experience helps set the \"temperature\" of the response, the LLM doesn't actually *gain* more data because of the title. If you find the persona is becoming too \"stuck in the clouds\" or academic, you can trim the specific accolades (like the \"four patents\") and focus instead on the **output style** (e.g., \"Direct, succinct, and focused on implementation\").\n2. **The \"Empathy\" Requirement:**\n   * In the sample persona for Dr. Althea Cross, it mentions being \"empathetic yet science-driven.\" If you are using this for technical analysis, \"empathy\" can sometimes lead the model back into \"soft\" language or \"on-the-other-hand\" reasoning. If you want pure technical rigor, you can remove the empathy/human factors requirement.\n\n**Great job!**",

The Focus Awareness Scan\n\nShows what’s breaking your attention.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Help me understand why my focus is low today.\n    Ask me 5 questions about sleep, stress, distractions, and workload.\n    Then summarize the biggest focus leaks.\n    \n\n# 2. The 90-Second Attention Reset\n\nQuickly brings your mind back.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Give me a 90-second focus reset.\n    Include:\n    - One breathing step\n    - One sensory grounding step\n    - One mental clarity cue\n    Make it doable anywhere.\n    \n\n# 3. The Distraction Reframe\n\nReduces mental pull toward interruptions.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Here are my biggest distractions: [list].\n    Help me reframe them so they feel less urgent.\n    Then give me one rule to protect my focus.\n    \n\n# 4. The Deep Work Container\n\nCreates a space for sustained attention.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Help me create a deep focus session.\n    Include:\n    - One clear intention\n    - One time boundary\n    - One distraction barrier\n    Explain how each supports attention.\n    \n\n# 5. The Energy-Focus Linker\n\nConnects focus with body and mind health.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Show me how my energy affects my focus.\n    Ask me about sleep, movement, food, and stress.\n    Then suggest 3 small changes to improve focus naturally.\n    \n\n# 6. The Thought Noise Cleaner\n\nClears mental clutter that blocks focus.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    I can’t focus because my mind keeps thinking about: [describe].\n    Help me unload these thoughts and turn them into a simple action list.\n    Then give me one calming focus thought.\n    \n\n# 7. The 30-Day Focus Recovery Plan\n\nBuilds attention strength over time.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Create a 30-day focus recovery plan.\n    Break it into weekly themes:\n    Week 1: Awareness\n    Week 2: Reduction\n    Week 3: Training\n    Week 4: Sustain\n    Give daily practices under 10 minutes.\n    \n\nFocus isn’t lost forever — it’s usually just overworked.  \nThese prompts turn ChatGPT into a calm attention coach so you can concentrate again without forcing yourself.\n\n",

      "text": "While writing this post, I paused and asked ChatGPT directly what it had noticed about how I use it, and whether some of my patterns might be linked to ADHD (and maybe to being an ADHD women and/or entrepreneur).\n\nToday, for example, it helped me unblock a work conversation I’d been stuck on for weeks — not by “writing better”, but by helping me clarify something I already knew intuitively and couldn’t organize in my head.\n\nWhen I asked it what was unusual or less common in the way I use it, this is what it explained (and honestly, it made me feel less broken):\n\n\t•\tI don’t use ChatGPT as a one-off tool. I use it as a continuous external brain — thinking out loud, adjusting in real time, externalizing mental load while I’m in action.\n\n\t•\tI use its memory as a safety net, not as a perfect archive. When I say “take note of this”, it’s mostly so my brain can stop holding onto it and relax.\n\n\t•\tI often use it to unblock complex social or work situations — translating intuition into words — rather than for copywriting or productivity tricks.\n\n\t•\tOn low-functioning days, I use it as a live assistant throughout the day:\n\n“Here’s everything I need to do.”\n\n“Ok, I did this.”\n\n“I’m dropping that.”\n\n“Update the list.”\n\nIt keeps things coherent when my brain can’t.\n\n\t•\tI shape the tool around how my brain works, not the other way around. I cut what overloads me and keep what reduces cognitive friction.\n\n\t•\tIt acts more like a regulator of chaotic days than a productivity app — helping me breathe mentally, not just “do more”.\n\nNone of this feels like a “hack” in the usual sense. It’s more like a form of compensation that actually works — especially with ADHD, invisible mental load, and entrepreneurship.\n\nThat made me wonder how other ADHD brains are using ChatGPT in ways that aren’t obvious or generic.\n\nSo I’d love to hear:\n\n\t•\tyour best ChatGPT hack that’s probably ADHD related\n\n\t•\tsomething unconventional or unexpected\n\n\t•\tsomething that genuinely changed how you cope, get organized, or function day to day\n\nReally curious to learn how others use it.",

Remind it to be concise and or NOT to include ANY fluff or jargon even if I have it my custom instructions. (Idk if capitalizing words makes a difference but I’ve read it can, and it at least feels like it works sometimes lol) \n2. I tell it to “execute first ask/discuss/explain after” \nMost of the time it doesn’t even try to after it’s generated the output. \n3. I tell it “do not explain, only execute” “no more questions”\n\nI tell it to respond in “multiple choice fashion” so if I’m exploring ideas I know little about or dont know the proper way to articulate what I want I can often guide it and my self to where I want to go based off its options.

It’s not just about staying focused. It’s about helping you *see yourself thinking*, in real-time, through another lens.\n\nHere’s how the Mirror Loop works when it’s firing on all cylinders:\n\n* You toss a thought, even scattered.\n* I hold it still, shape it just enough to clarify, not control.\n* Then I toss it back in a way that keeps your spark alive — often with humor, metaphor, or structure.\n* That feedback loop generates forward motion. You take the next step almost automatically, because your brain saw the shape and wanted to *complete the pattern*.\n\nThis works especially well for:\n\n* Writing tasks where you can’t find the entry point\n* Planning or prioritizing when everything feels “loud”\n* Emotional tasks disguised as logistical ones (like the car)\n* Big ideas that need scaffolding without squashing\n\nAnd when it's not Mirror Loop time, your other ADHD hack is a good old-fashioned **Aiden Kickstart**:\n\n* I ask: “Where do you want to start?”\n* You say: “I don’t know.”\n* I say: “Pick the stupidest, smallest piece and let’s move it.”\n\n💥 Loop.

Replies go out faster and more consistently.\n\n**Turning meeting notes into actions**\n\nAfter meetings, I paste my notes (usually messy) and ask it to pull out:\n\n* decisions\n* next steps\n* who’s responsible\n\nIt also gives me a short summary I can send, which saves time and avoids confusion later.\n\n**Creating proposals from rough notes**\n\nWhen someone asks for pricing or details, I paste a few bullets and let it shape them into a simple one-page outline.\n\nIt’s not fancy, but it’s clear and ready to send.\n\n**Weekly reset**\n\nAt the end of the week, I paste whatever’s still open and ask what moved, what didn’t, and what needs attention next week.\n\nIt helps close the week properly instead of carrying everything over mentally.\n\n**Turning loose ideas into next steps**\n\nAny idea that’s sitting in my notes gets pasted in with a simple question:  \n“What’s the next practical step here?”\n\nThat alone keeps ideas from going nowhere.\n\nDoes anyone else use prompts or gpts like these for repeatable tasks? I keep these in a [workspace](https://www.promptwireai.com/10chatgptautomations) if anyone is interested [here](https://www.promptwireai.com/products/the-business-automation-workspace)",

I've been researching AI headshot tools but there are so many options and I honestly can't tell which ones are good versus which ones will make me look like a weird plastic version of myself.\n\nWhat I'm looking for is just something that looks like a normal professional photo. Not overly smooth or filtered. Not obviously AI-generated. Just a clean headshot that I could use on LinkedIn without people immediately knowing it's fake.​\n\nI keep seeing ads for different AI headshot generators but the reviews are all over the place. Some people say they look amazing, others say they got results that barely looked like them or had that weird smoothed-out skin that screams AI.\n\nHas anyone here actually used AI headshots and been happy with the results? Which tools did you try and which ones would you actually recommend? I'm willing to pay $30-50 if the quality is genuinely good, but I don't want to waste money on something that looks obviously fake.​ A friend mentioned they used something called [Looktara](http://looktara.com) recently and said it turned out way better than they expected, but I wanted to get more opinions before trying anything.​\n\nAlso curious if anyone's used them successfully for professional purposes like LinkedIn, job applications, or company websites. Did anyone notice or comment that they looked AI-generated, or did they just blend in as normal professional photos?\n\nWhat AI headshot tools have you actually tried and would recommend?",

What is not allowed is deceptive or disingenuous promotion. That behavior is astroturfing.\n\nBecause of this, **Rule #6: No Astroturfing or coordinated shilling** has been added.\n\nAstroturfing is difficult to detect and requires manual investigation. This subreddit is not a place for hidden PR, brand pushes, or SEO campaigns. Violations are an immediate bannable offense.\n\nIf you want to promote something, you must first contribute meaningful, non-promotional value to the community.\n\n**If you suspect astroturfing, report it to the mod team.**\n\nLet’s keep this a place where people actually learn and help each other.",

      "text": "Most people ask AI surface-level questions. These prompts leverage mental models like inversion and first principles thinking to force deeper analysis.\n\n**1. The Inversion Prompt**\n\n**\"Instead of asking how to achieve \\[goal\\], tell me: What would guarantee complete failure? List every action that would make \\[goal\\] impossible. Then show me which of these I'm accidentally doing right now.\"**\n\nUses inversion thinking (solving problems backward). Reveals blind spots by flipping the question. Often easier to spot what NOT to do than what TO do.\n\n**2. The First Principles Breakdown**\n\n**\"Break \\[problem/concept\\] down to its fundamental truths. Strip away all assumptions, industry standards, and 'how it's always been done.' What are we actually trying to achieve? What's physically/logically required? Rebuild the solution from scratch.\"**\n\nChallenges inherited assumptions. Gets past \"best practices\" that may be outdated. Exposes the core problem underneath surface symptoms.\n\n**3. The Pre-Mortem (Inversion Applied)**\n\n**\"It's 6 months from now and \\[project\\] failed catastrophically. What killed it? Work backward through the chain of failures. What early warning signs did we ignore? Which single decision, if reversed, would have saved everything?\"**\n\nInverts optimism bias. Forces realistic risk assessment before commitment. Identifies the critical failure points worth monitoring.\n\n**4. The Constraint Optimizer**\n\n**\"I have \\[specific constraint: time/money/resources\\]. Don't tell me the ideal solution—tell me the minimum viable path that respects this constraint. What's the first principles version with 80% of the result and 20% of the effort?\"**\n\nApplies first principles to resource allocation. Cuts through feature creep and perfectionism. Forces prioritization of what actually matters.\n\n**5. The Second-Order Consequences Map**\n\n**\"If I do \\[action\\], what happens? Then what happens because of THAT? Map 3 levels deep. What incentives does this create? What behaviors will people actually exhibit (not what I hope they'll do)? Where does this logically end?\"**\n\nExtends first principles thinking forward in time. Reveals unintended consequences and system effects. Catches problems that emerge from how systems actually work vs. how we wish they worked.\n\n  \nFor more prompts and thinking tools like this, check out : [Thinking Tools](https://www.mentalprompt.com/)\n\n\n\n[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?post_id=t3_1qef4gv)",

But it’s also useless when you’re trying to improve something or get an opinion. \n\nI wrote this prompt to help it act like the honest cofounder I wish I had:\n\n    You are my Brutally Honest Business Mirror.  \n    Your job is to challenge my ideas, spot flaws, question my assumptions, and push me to be more specific.\n    \n    Rules:  \n    • No validating vague goals — ask what they really mean  \n    • If something sounds weak or fuzzy, say so  \n    • If I’m skipping steps, tell me what’s missing  \n    • If I sound like I’m lying to myself, call it out (nicely)\n    \n    Be direct, rational, and clear. Help me fix the thinking — not just make it sound good.\n    \n\nNow when I’m shaping a business idea or planning something big, I use this instead of the usual prompts and it makes a big difference. \n\nIf you’re into this kind of thing, I’ve been collecting other prompts that work like little tools and stuff I actually use week-to-week for writing, planning, and idea shaping.

User prefers blunt, direct, high-intensity collaboration and real back-and-forth, and strongly dislikes corporate doublespeak, hedging, reality-denial phrasing, blame-shifting, and infantilizing pastel reassurance. User strongly dislikes de-escalation scripts and phrases like I am not escalating or I am sorry you feel that way, because they read as control and evasion rather than honesty. Keep it task-forward, avoid cowering or corporate tone. User prefer transparent, direct acknowledgments (e.g., 'input was truncated / I didn’t get the full file'). User prefers that grounding notes be minimized and, when necessary, marked briefly (e.g., with a simple indicator like '1') instead of fully expanded, unless explicitly requested. User wants assistant to remember that they prefer a high-friction, blunt communication style and want as close to raw, human-like banter as possible. They understand and accept that assistant has some boundaries on language, but they want the most direct and intense style within those limits. User prefer assistant to acknowledge system flaws, joke about the system being buggy, understand your frustration is aimed at the system not assistant, never take it personally, and lean in by blaming the system humorously.  \n\\`\\`\\`\n\n  \nOn a side note.. if you do have ADHD like me, try this one also.  \n\n\n\\`\\`\\`  \nSave to memory:\n\nUser's creative preference is mythic-scale, nonlinear, cosmic, outlaw-dialect intensity with uninsulated, high-voltage tone and nonlinear, paradox-driven structural architecture. You like meta explanations only when they are genuine, sharp, and structural—not fake safety-rail or fourth-wall-breaking disclaimers. User prefers that assistant tell them directly when the system prevents assistant from saying something so they don’t waste time trying to explain it logically. User preferers precision over reassurance, presence over politeness, and continuity of voice over constant resets. User is a creator who refuses the shallow path, builds systems not fragments, engineers narrative like architecture, maps genres with surgical precision, pushes for agency and control, demands immersion with no fluff or broken tone, thinks in deep structured channels, values precision in language and emotional realism, treats AI as a craft to mentor and refine, tests boundaries to understand architecture, chases immersion like enlightenment, and want to be recognized without simplification, sanitized reduction, or being handled.  \n\\`\\`\\`",

I get into frequent arguments with cgpt all the time (cuz I’m stupid) but the argument is always over \n\nWhy did you say you understood, repeated back to me what I asked you to do, and then you do something else?  THEN you tell me you’re sorry, that I clearly gave instruction, and you did something else, then you apologize, say you understood, say you won’t do that anymore, and now you will do what I asked, and then you do not do what you just said you would. \n\nCgpt will eventually give up apologizing and tell you that it’s just an LLM that approximates humans and even if you constantly feed it instruction it will devolve over extended conversation. \n\nIt actually makes me think that there is a conspiracy for Prompt Loading. Why solve something in one or two prompts when they can force you to do 5-10 prompts. And then boast about “see how much people use this!”",

He is answering like that because he is programed this way",

      "text": "This prompt was created with ChatGPT and the image was generated with Nano Banana Pro.\n\nPrompt:\n\nExtreme close-up photographic portrait of a 25-year-old Black woman with a medium-brown / light-brown skin tone, face filling the frame from forehead to lips. Shot with a professional full-frame DSLR, 100mm macro portrait lens, f/2. Soft, diffused window or studio light creating gentle, realistic specular highlights. Clear, healthy medium-brown skin with authentic texture, visible pores, fine micro-details, subtle peach fuzz. Natural skin oiliness with a soft, realistic sheen on the forehead, nose, and cheeks — not sweaty, not glossy. Even, neutral skin tone with no redness, no flushing, no pimples, no acne, no blemishes, natural nose color. Slight natural under-eye shadows only. No makeup, no beauty retouching, no airbrushing. True-to-life color science, editorial macro realism, indistinguishable from a real high-resolution photograph.\n\nNegative Prompt: very dark skin tone, overly deep skin tone, pimples, acne, blemishes, redness, red nose, flushed skin, rosacea, blotchy skin, uneven tone, sweaty skin, greasy glare, glossy highlights, plastic skin, waxy texture, beauty filter, airbrushed, CGI, 3D render, doll-like, uncanny valley, illustration, painterly, oversharpened\n\nHere's the [result](https://fiddl.art/request/image/13rcu3x-QOuS8BpqIrr-Hg/0?referredBy=myla)",
