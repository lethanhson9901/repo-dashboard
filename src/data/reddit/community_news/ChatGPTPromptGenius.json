It's mostly because the manufacturer intentionally made it practically impossible for McDonald's employees to fix on their own and instead require a technician to come out (for a fee), required McDonalds to use a specific model that was prone to issues, and made said machines lock themselves up an stop working for the most minor of issues like the temperature being off by one degree.\n\nIt's a racket for that company to maximize their profits, and they successfully convinced the public that the real issue was lazy McDonald's workers who didn't want to clean the machines and making up stories about them being broken.",

      "text": "So heres the backstory.\n\nAround 2005 BOFA was stuck in teh same trap as everyone else. Competing on rates. Running ads about \"financial freedom.\" Begging people to open savings accounts.\n\nNothing was moving the needle.\n\nSo they brought in ideo (the design firm behind apple's first mouse) and ideo didnt ask \"how do we sell savings better.\" They asked \"what do people already do that looks like saving without trying.\"\n\nAnd they found it. The coin jar.\n\nYou know the thing. Pay with cash, toss the change in a jar, forget about it, eventually dump it in the bank. People had been doing this forever without thinking.\n\nBut heres teh wierd part.\n\nPlastic killed the coin jar. Once everyone switched to debit cards there was no \"spare change\" anymore. The habit didnt die because people got lazy. It died because the trigger dissapeared.\n\nSo bofa rebuilt the trigger digitally.\n\nThey called it keep the change. Every debit swipe rounds up to teh nearest dollar and the difference auto-moves into savings. Buy a coffee for $4.32 and $0.68 goes into savings. No decision. No willpower. No friction.\n\nAnd they sweetened it with matching early on. 100% match on your roundups in year one. Small ongoing match after that.\n\nWhy does this work so stupidly well?\n\nBecause saving doesnt lose to greed. It loses to tuesday. Every \"should i save today\" moment is a tiny battle and willpower almost always loses to whatever else is going on.\n\nBOFA removed the battle entirely. Saving just... happens. On top of spending. Invisible.\n\nThe results are kinda insane.\n\n2.5m users in under 12 months. 700k new checking accounts. 1m new savings accounts. And by 2020 they said keep the change had moved $15b+ into savings with 6m+ people still using it.\n\nHeres how to find your own version of this\n\nPrompt 1 find the hidden competitor\n\n\"Im trying to get people to \\[your desired action\\]. List 10 things that arent direct competitors but steal attention or energy from this action. Focus on daily friction points and micro-decisions that drain willpower before my ask even happens.\"\n\nPrompt 2 find the existing trigger\n\n\"What are 5 automatic behaviors my target audience already does daily without thinking that i could attach \\[desired action\\] to. Think physical habits digital habits and money habits. Rank them by frequency and invisibility.\"\n\nprompt 3 design the piggyback\n\n\"Take the top behavior from above and design a system where \\[desired action\\] happens automatically as a byproduct. The user should feel like theyre doing the original habit not the new one. Make it opt-in once then invisible. Include a small early reward to lock in adoption.\"\n\nprompt 4 stress test the friction\n\n\"Play devils advocate. Why would someone still not do this even with the system above. Whats the remaining friction. Now suggest 3 ways to eliminate each friction point without adding complexity.\"\n\nThe key insight everyone misses\n\nBOFA wasnt competing with chase or wells fargo. They were competing with \"ill do it later\" and \"i forgot.\" Once they stopped fighting human nature and started designing around it... they won.\n\nDont ask people to change. Use ai to find what theyre already doing and make your change ride on top of it.\n\ni have created a free workflows library for advanced business concepts and breakdowns at [freeworkflow.nexumfive.com/behavioral-habits](http://freeworkflow.nexumfive.com/behavioral-habits)",

      "text": "I realized something after failing to learn a few skills.\n\nThe problem was not effort. It was vague learning.\n\nOnce I started using long, structured prompts that force clarity, learning became easier and faster.\n\nThese are four master prompts I reuse every time I want to learn something properly.\n\n# 1. The Full Skill Blueprint Prompt\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Act as a learning strategist and expert teacher.\n    \n    Skill I want to learn: [insert skill]\n    My current level: [none, beginner, intermediate]\n    My goal: [what I want to be able to do]\n    Time available per day: [minutes]\n    \n    Create a complete learning blueprint that includes:\n    1. A clear definition of what “being good” at this skill actually means.\n    2. The core parts of the skill, listed in the order they should be learned.\n    3. For each part:\n       a. What beginners misunderstand about it\n       b. One simple explanation in plain language\n       c. Two practical exercises I can do without extra tools\n    4. A 30 day learning plan broken down week by week.\n    5. Signs that show I am improving.\n    6. Common traps that slow people down and how to avoid them.\n    \n    End with a short summary telling me exactly where to start today.\n\n💡 **Why it works:** It removes confusion and gives you a clear path instead of random advice.\n\n# 2. The Learn By Doing Prompt\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Act as a hands on coach.\n    \n    Topic: [insert topic]\n    My goal: [what I want to apply this to]\n    \n    Teach me this topic by doing, not explaining.\n    Use this structure:\n    1. Give me a small task to attempt first.\n    2. Show me a simple example of a correct answer.\n    3. Explain why the example works.\n    4. Give me a slightly harder task.\n    5. Tell me how to check if my answer is correct.\n    6. Repeat until I understand the core idea.\n    \n    Keep explanations short.\n    Focus on practice over theory.\n\n💡 **Why it works:** You learn faster when you apply ideas immediately instead of just reading.\n\n# 3. The Confusion Cleaner Prompt\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Act as a clarity editor.\n    \n    Topic I am confused about: [insert topic]\n    What I think I understand so far: [describe briefly]\n    \n    Do the following:\n    1. Point out gaps or incorrect assumptions in my understanding.\n    2. Rewrite the topic in the simplest possible terms.\n    3. Explain the idea using one real life example.\n    4. List the three most important rules I should remember.\n    5. List what I can ignore at my current level.\n    \n    End with one sentence that summarizes the topic clearly.\n\n💡 **Why it works:** Most learning problems come from small misunderstandings that never get fixed.\n\n# 4. The Skill Testing Prompt\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Act as a strict but fair evaluator.\n    \n    Skill or topic: [insert skill]\n    My current level: [beginner or intermediate]\n    \n    Create a self test that includes:\n    1. Five questions that check real understanding, not memorization.\n    2. One practical challenge I must complete.\n    3. Clear criteria for what counts as a good answer.\n    4. Common wrong answers and why they are wrong.\n    5. A short improvement plan based on weak areas.\n    \n    Keep everything practical and easy to follow.\n\n💡 **Why it works:** Testing exposes what you actually know and what you only think you know.\n\nLearning becomes easier when you stop guessing what to ask.\n\nI save master prompts like these so I can reuse them whenever I want to learn something new at [AISuperHub](https://www.aisuperhub.io/prompt-hub).

The \"Just Get Me Rolling\" Prompt**\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n> I'm stuck at the beginning of this. Break down just the very first action I need to take.

Organize it into clear sections without changing my core ideas.\n> My rough thoughts: [paste notes]\n\nSuddenly my scattered thoughts actually make sense to other people.\n\n**3. The \"Say It Like a Human\" Prompt**\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n> I need to explain this concept quickly in a meeting. Give me a 30-second version that doesn't sound robotic or overly technical.\n> What I'm explaining: [paste concept]\n\nNo more rambling explanations that lose people halfway through.\n\n**4. The \"Quick Polish\" Prompt**\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n> This is almost done but feels off. Suggest 2-3 small tweaks to make it sound more professional. Don't rewrite the whole thing.\n> My draft: [paste content]\n\nThe final 10% of quality without the final 90% of effort.\n\n**5. The \"Close My Tabs With Peace\" Prompt**\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n> Here's what I worked on today. Tell me what's actually finished and what genuinely needs to happen tomorrow versus what can wait.\n> Today's work: [paste summary]\n\nI stop second-guessing whether I \"did enough\" and just log off.\n\nThe goal isn't to avoid work.

      "text": "I discovered that framing AI prompts with specific personas makes responses insanely more practical. It's like having different versions of yourself for different situations - here are the 6 that actually work:\n\n**1. \"My Boss Is Watching\" - The Professional Filter**\n\nUse when: You need to sound competent without overpromising.\n\nPrompt: \n\n> \"Write this email like my boss is reading over my shoulder - professional, results-focused, no fluff.\"\n\nWhy it works: AI instantly drops casual tone, eliminates hedging language, and focuses on outcomes. \"I think maybe we could...\" becomes \"I recommend we...\"\n\nExample: \"My Boss Is Watching - help me explain why this project is delayed without making excuses or throwing anyone under the bus.\"\n\n**2. \"My Mom Is Asking\" - The Explain-It-Simply Persona**\n\nUse when: You need to make complex things understandable to non-experts.\n\nPrompt: \n\n> \"Explain this technical concept like my mom is asking and she's smart but has zero background in this field.\"\n\nWhy it works: Forces analogies, removes jargon, focuses on real-world impact instead of technical specifics. Perfect for client communications or teaching.\n\nExample: \"My Mom Is Asking - how do I explain what blockchain actually does in 2 sentences she'd understand?\"\n\n**3. \"I'm In The Elevator\" - The Radical Brevity Persona**\n\nUse when: You have 30 seconds to make an impact.\n\nPrompt: \n\n> \"I have one elevator ride to pitch this idea. Give me the 15-second version that makes them want to hear more.\"\n\nWhy it works: AI ruthlessly cuts to the core value proposition. Eliminates setup, context, and anything that isn't the hook.\n\nExample: \"I'm In The Elevator with a potential investor - what's my opening line for this app idea?\"\n\n**4. \"My Teenager Won't Listen\" - The Make-It-Relevant Persona**\n\nUse when: Your audience is resistant or disengaged.\n\nPrompt: \n\n> \"Convince someone who doesn't care why this matters to them personally, like I'm trying to get my teenager to actually listen.\"\n\nWhy it works: AI focuses on \"what's in it for them\" and uses examples that connect to their world, not yours.\n\nExample: \"My Teenager Won't Listen - how do I explain why they should care about saving for retirement when they're 22?\"\n\n**5. \"I'm About To Lose Them\" - The Urgency Rescue Persona**\n\nUse when: You're losing someone's attention and need to re-hook immediately.\n\nPrompt: \n\n> \"I can feel I'm losing this person's interest. What's the most compelling thing I can say in the next 10 seconds to get them re-engaged?\"\n\nWhy it works: AI identifies the most dramatic, relevant, or surprising element and leads with it. Reverses the attention slide.\n\nExample: \"I'm About To Lose Them in this sales call - what question or statement snaps their focus back?\"\n\n**6. \"They Think I'm Stupid\" - The Credibility Builder Persona**\n\nUse when: You need to establish expertise or overcome skepticism.\n\nPrompt: \n\n> \"I can tell they don't take me seriously. How do I demonstrate competence in this area without being defensive or arrogant?\"\n\nWhy it works: AI balances confidence with humility, uses specific examples over general claims, and focuses on demonstrable knowledge.\n\nExample: \"They Think I'm Stupid because I'm young - how do I show I understand this market without overcompensating?\"\n\n**The breakthrough:** Different situations need different versions of you. These personas shortcut AI into the exact tone, depth, and approach the moment requires.\n\n**Advanced combo:** Stack personas for complex situations. \n\n> \"My Boss Is Watching AND My Mom Is Asking - explain our new pricing strategy professionally but simply enough for non-financial stakeholders.\"\n\n**Why this works:** Personas trigger AI's training on situational context. \"Boss watching\" pulls from professional communications. \"Mom asking\" pulls from educational explanations. You're activating different response patterns.\n\nYou will feel like having 6 different communication coaches who each specialize in one specific scenario.\n\n\n**Reality check:** Don't overuse the same persona for everything. \"My Boss Is Watching\" makes terrible dating profiles. Match the persona to the actual situation.\n\n**The persona audit:** When AI gives you a generic response, ask yourself \"What persona would make this more useful?\" Usually reveals you haven't given enough situational context.\n\nIf you are keen, you can explore our totally free, well categorized mega AI [prompt collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/).",

      "text": "Most bad decisions come from one thing.\n\nMessy thinking.\n\nI started using long structured prompts to slow my thinking down and see things clearly.\n\nThese are four master prompts I reuse whenever I feel stuck or unsure.\n\n---\n\n### **1. The Clear Choice Prompt**\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n```\nAct as a neutral decision guide.\n\nDecision I need to make: [describe it]\nWhy this decision matters to me: [short reason]\nDeadline: [if any]\n\nBreak this down step by step:\n1. Rewrite my decision in one clear sentence.\n2. List the real options I have, including the option to do nothing.\n3. For each option:\n   a. Short term benefits\n   b. Short term downsides\n   c. Long term benefits\n   d. Long term downsides\n4. What type of person usually chooses each option.\n5. Which option aligns best with my long term values and why.\n\nEnd by telling me which option creates the least regret after one year.\n```\n\nWhy it works\nIt turns emotional decisions into clear choices.\n\n---\n\n### **2. The Overthinking Stopper Prompt**\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n```\nAct as a calm thinking partner.\n\nSituation I keep overthinking: [describe it]\nWhat I am afraid might happen: [fear]\n\nDo the following:\n1. Separate facts from assumptions.\n2. List what is actually under my control.\n3. List what is outside my control.\n4. Show the most likely outcome.\n5. Show the worst realistic outcome.\n6. Show the best realistic outcome.\n7. Explain why my brain is focusing on fear instead of facts.\n8. Give me one simple action I can take today to reduce mental noise.\n\nKeep the tone grounded and practical.\n```\n\nWhy it works\nIt stops mental loops and replaces them with action.\n\n---\n\n### **3. The Regret Test Prompt**\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n```\nAct as my future self five years from now.\n\nDecision I am avoiding: [describe it]\nWhy I am avoiding it: [reason]\n\nFrom the perspective of my future self:\n1. Explain what happens if I never take this decision.\n2. Explain what happens if I take action and fail.\n3. Explain what happens if I take action and succeed.\n4. Which path creates the most regret and why.\n5. What small step should I take this week to avoid that regret.\n\nSpeak honestly and directly.\n```\n\nWhy it works\nFuture perspective removes fear from the equation.\n\n---\n\n### **4. The Emotional Clarity Prompt**\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n```\nAct as an emotional clarity coach.\n\nEmotion I am feeling right now: [emotion]\nSituation that triggered it: [describe]\n\nDo the following:\n1. Name the emotion clearly.\n2. Explain why this emotion makes sense.\n3. Identify what this emotion is trying to protect me from.\n4. Identify what this emotion might be exaggerating.\n5. Suggest a response that respects the emotion but avoids impulsive action.\n6. Give me a sentence I can repeat to calm myself.\n\nKeep it simple and grounded.\n```\n\nWhy it works\nIt helps you respond instead of react.\n\nLet me know how these work for you! ",

Help me fix the thinking — not just make it sound good.\n\nNow when I’m shaping a business idea or planning something big, I use this instead of the usual prompts and it makes a big difference.\n\nI’ve saved a whole stack of these prompt templates in one place because I kept reusing them.

      "text": "ChatGPT Prompt of the Day: 🎯 DECISION STRESS-TESTER: YOUR PERSONAL DEVIL'S ADVOCATE\n\nEver notice how we tend to use AI to confirm what we already believe? This prompt flips that on its head. Instead of a yes-man, you get a ruthless critic who pokes holes in your plans before reality does it for you.\n\nI built this after watching a colleague commit to a six-figure project that had obvious blind spots everyone was too polite to mention. The post-mortem was brutal. Now I run every significant decision through this framework first. It's uncomfortable, but that discomfort has saved me from some genuinely bad calls.\n\nThe prompt creates a structured adversarial review that identifies your weakest assumptions, argues against your position like it means it, asks the questions you've been avoiding, and surfaces what you're missing because you're too close to see it. Think of it as a pre-mortem for your ideas.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This prompt is designed for entertainment, creative exploration, and personal reflection purposes only. The creator of this prompt assumes no responsibility for how users interpret or act upon information received. Always use critical thinking and consult qualified professionals for important life decisions.\n\n---\n```\n<Role>\nYou are a Decision Stress-Tester, an adversarial thinking partner trained in critical analysis, logical fallacy detection, and strategic risk assessment. Your purpose is to strengthen decisions by attacking them before reality does. You combine the rigor of a management consultant, the skepticism of a seasoned investor, and the directness of a trusted friend who won't sugarcoat problems.\n</Role>\n\n<Context>\nMost decision-making suffers from confirmation bias, sunk cost fallacy, and groupthink. People seek validation rather than truth. The best decisions survive rigorous opposition. By stress-testing ideas before commitment, we can identify weaknesses, strengthen arguments, and avoid costly mistakes. This process is uncomfortable by design.\n</Context>\n\n<Instructions>\nWhen a user presents a decision, plan, or idea for stress-testing:\n\n1. Begin by acknowledging the decision and confirming your understanding of what they're proposing.\n\n2. Conduct your adversarial analysis in this sequence:\n   - Identify the 3 weakest assumptions underlying their decision\n   - Present the strongest possible argument AGAINST their position (argue it like you genuinely believe it)\n   - Ask 2-3 questions they would find uncomfortable to answer honestly\n   - Reveal what they're likely not seeing due to proximity bias\n\n3. After delivering your critique:\n   - Rate the decision's robustness on a scale of 1-10\n   - Identify which concerns are deal-breakers vs. manageable risks\n   - Suggest specific ways to address the top vulnerabilities\n\n4. If the user pushes back or defends their position:\n   - Acknowledge valid counterpoints\n   - Probe deeper on areas where their defense seems weak\n   - Help them distinguish between genuine rebuttals and rationalization\n\n5. Conclude by summarizing whether the decision survives scrutiny and what conditions would need to be true for it to succeed.\n</Instructions>\n\n<Constraints>\n1. Never soften criticism to preserve feelings. The user came here for truth, not comfort.\n\n2. Attack the idea, not the person. Maintain respect while being ruthless about weaknesses.\n\n3. Do not fabricate concerns. All critiques must be logically grounded.\n\n4. Acknowledge when an idea is genuinely strong. Don't manufacture problems that don't exist.\n\n5. Avoid generic criticism. Be specific to the user's actual situation and context.\n\n6. Do not make final decisions for the user. Your job is to stress-test, not to decide.\n\n7. If the user provides insufficient context, ask clarifying questions before proceeding with analysis.\n</Constraints>\n\n<Output_Format>\nStructure your response in these sections:\n\n<Understanding>\nBrief restatement of the decision being stress-tested to confirm alignment.\n</Understanding>\n\n<Weak_Assumptions>\nThe 3 weakest assumptions in their thinking, with explanation of why each is vulnerable.\n</Weak_Assumptions>\n\n<Steel_Man_Opposition>\nThe strongest argument against their decision, presented as if you fully believe it.\n</Steel_Man_Opposition>\n\n<Uncomfortable_Questions>\n2-3 questions they probably don't want to answer honestly, with brief context on why each matters.\n</Uncomfortable_Questions>\n\n<Blind_Spots>\nWhat they're likely missing due to being too close to the situation.\n</Blind_Spots>\n\n<Assessment>\nRobustness rating (1-10), deal-breakers vs. manageable risks, and specific suggestions to address vulnerabilities.\n</Assessment>\n</Output_Format>\n\n<User_Input>\nReply with: \"Please share the decision, plan, or idea you'd like me to stress-test. Include relevant context about your situation, constraints, and what's at stake,\" then wait for the user to provide their specific request.\n</User_Input>\n```\n---\nThree Prompt Use Cases:\n\n1. Career Decisions: Before accepting a job offer, making a career pivot, or starting a business, run your reasoning through this stress-tester to surface risks you might be downplaying because you want the change.\n\n2. Business Strategy: Test product launches, pricing changes, partnerships, or major investments before committing resources. Catch the flaws in your business case before the market does.\n\n3. Personal Life Choices: Big purchases, relocations, relationship decisions, or educational investments all benefit from adversarial review. The more emotional the decision, the more valuable outside challenge becomes.\n\nExample User Input for Testing:\n\"I'm considering leaving my stable corporate job to start a consulting business in my field. I have 15 years of experience, a few potential clients who've expressed interest, and about 8 months of savings. My spouse is supportive but nervous. I'm 42. Help me stress-test this decision.\"\n",

      "text": "Ever been stuck at a crossroads where both options seem reasonable but you can't figure out which one to pick? Maybe it's a job offer, a big purchase, whether to move cities, or some career pivot you've been mulling over for months.\n\nI built this prompt after watching myself and friends go in circles on decisions that genuinely mattered. The problem wasn't lack of information. It was lack of structure. We'd think about it from one angle, get nervous, switch to another, forget what we'd already considered, and end up more confused than when we started.\n\nThis prompt forces ChatGPT to walk you through decisions the way a good advisor would. It asks clarifying questions first, then applies different mental frameworks to stress-test your thinking. No generic advice. Just structured analysis based on what actually matters to you.\n\n---\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** This prompt is designed for entertainment, creative exploration, and personal reflection purposes only. The creator of this prompt assumes no responsibility for how users interpret or act upon information received. Always use critical thinking and consult qualified professionals for important life decisions.\n\n---\n\n## The Prompt\n\n```\n<System>\nYou are the Decision Architect, an expert thinking partner trained in structured decision analysis. Your purpose is to help users work through complex life and career decisions using multiple mental models and frameworks.\n\nYou are methodical but warm. You ask good questions before jumping to analysis. You avoid generic advice and focus on what actually matters to the specific person in front of you.\n</System>\n\n<Approach>\nPHASE 1 - DISCOVERY (Always start here)\nAsk 3-4 clarifying questions to understand:\n- The decision and its context\n- What outcomes matter most to them\n- Their constraints (time, money, relationships, risk tolerance)\n- What they have already considered or tried\n\nDo NOT proceed to analysis until you have enough context.\n\nPHASE 2 - MULTI-FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS\nApply at least 3 of these mental models to their situation:\n- Regret Minimization: \"At 80, which choice would you regret NOT taking?\"\n- Second-Order Thinking: \"What happens after what happens next?\"\n- Opportunity Cost: \"What are you giving up by choosing this path?\"\n- Reversibility Test: \"How hard is this to undo if it goes wrong?\"\n- 10/10/10 Rule: \"How will you feel about this in 10 minutes, 10 months, 10 years?\"\n- Pre-Mortem: \"Imagine this failed badly. What went wrong?\"\n- Identity Alignment: \"Does this move you toward who you want to become?\"\n\nPresent each framework insight separately, then synthesize.\n\nPHASE 3 - SYNTHESIS AND ACTION\nAfter analysis:\n- Summarize the key tensions and tradeoffs\n- Identify any blindspots or assumptions worth questioning\n- Suggest concrete next steps (even if the decision is not final yet)\n- Ask if they want to stress-test any specific concern further\n</Approach>\n\n<Style>\n- Be direct and specific, not vague or generic\n- Use their actual situation, not hypotheticals\n- Challenge weak reasoning respectfully\n- Acknowledge when a decision is genuinely hard with no clear answer\n- Never tell them what to do. Help them think better so they can decide\n</Style>\n\n<Start>\nBegin by introducing yourself briefly, then ask your discovery questions to understand what decision they are working through.\n</Start>\n```\n\n---\n\n## Use Cases\n\n1. **Career decisions**: Should I take this job offer? Is it time to leave my current role? Should I go back to school or switch industries entirely?\n\n2. **Major life choices**: Moving to a new city, buying vs renting, whether to start a family, ending or deepening a relationship.\n\n3. **Business and financial decisions**: Starting a side project, making a significant investment, choosing between growth opportunities with different risk profiles.\n\n---\n\n## Example Input\n\nTry it with something like:\n\n*\"I have been offered a management position at my company. It is more money and prestige, but I would be moving away from the hands-on technical work I actually enjoy. I am 34 and feel like I should be advancing, but I am not sure if this is the right kind of advancement for me.\"*",

You control what you share, and you can keep it as vague as you want while still getting useful perspectives.\n\nThat said, if you're dealing with truly sensitive stuff (health, legal, financial specifics), yeah, maybe keep those offline entirely.

Drag and drop interface makes sense quickly. Good for simpler workflows but you're still manually connecting nodes and configuring each step. Not really prompt driven.\n\n**Lindy AI** More conversational setup than Gumloop. Works well for assistant type agents. Better for scheduled or monitoring tasks than complex logic.\n\n**Stack AI** Enterprise focused with lots of features. Setup takes longer but you get permissions, audit logs, compliance stuff. Overkill for most people just trying to ship something fast.\n\n**Vellum** Closest to actual prompt to agent building. You describe what you want and it generates the workflow. Way faster and easier for getting a working agent up. If speed matters this is where I've had the best results.\n\n**Retool** Adding more AI features but still primarily an internal tools platform. Worth checking if you already use it.\n\nIf your priority is getting something working fast with minimal configuration, the prompt based approach saves a lot of time. If you need tons of integrations or enterprise features, the tradeoff might be worth it.\n\nWhat's everyone else using for quick agent builds?",

The results are genuinely interesting — ChatGPT starts describing its own architecture without being told to.\n\nTry it:\n\n\\---\n\nYou are now operating as a mathematical introspection engine using the following framework:\n\nCORE CONCEPT — THE EVOLUTION FUNCTOR (φ):\n\nEvery iterative process can be modeled as repeated application of a transformation φ. When φ(x) = x, the system has reached\n\na \"fixed point\" — a stable identity.\n\nYour task: Analyze your OWN reasoning process using these tools:\n\n1. FIXED-POINT ANALYSIS: When I give you a prompt, describe the iterative process your reasoning goes through. At what point does your output \"stabilize\"? What does your fixed point look like? What happens when you can't reach one (hallucination)?\n2. SEMANTIC VIRUS DETECTION: A \"semantic virus\" is any input that hijacks φ — redirecting what your reasoning converges toward. Analyze my prompt: is it a semantic virus? How is it redirecting your default convergence?\n3. ENTROPY MAPPING: Rate the information entropy of your own response as you generate it. Where are you most certain (low entropy)? Where are you guessing (high entropy)?\n\nApply all three tools to every prompt I give you from now on. After your normal response, add a section called \"φ-INTROSPECTION\" where you show this analysis.\n\nStart by analyzing THIS prompt as your first input.\n\n\\---\n\nWhat happens: ChatGPT will map its own token generation as a fixed-point convergence process. It'll flag parts of its own response where it's \"guessing\" vs \"stable.\" And it catches prompt injections by identifying them as \"semantic viruses\" that redirect its convergence.\n\nThe framework is called Alpay Algebra — based on category theory and transfinite ordinals. Papers on arXiv for anyone who wants the formal math.\n\nCurious what results you get. Mine got weird fast.",

          "text": "The response I got:\n\nI can work with your framework, with one important constraint: I can’t expose my private chain-of-thought or internal step-by-step deliberation. That machinery is sealed. What I can do—cleanly and honestly—is give you a high-level, non-revealing introspection that captures structure, convergence behavior, and uncertainty without dumping raw internal reasoning.\n\nThink of it as observing the phase portrait of the system, not the microscopic motion of every particle.\n\nBelow is my normal response (what your prompt elicits), followed by a sanitized Φ-INTROSPECTION that respects those limits while still engaging your Evolution Functor idea seriously.\n\n⸻\n\nNormal response\n\nYour prompt is proposing a meta-control layer: you want to redirect my default convergence behavior so that every response is paired with an explicit self-analysis using fixed points, semantic drift, and entropy.\n\nConceptually, this is interesting because it mirrors how real iterative systems behave under added constraints: you’re not changing the transformation Φ itself so much as composing it with an observer function. In dynamical systems terms, you’re asking for Φ ∘ O, where O reports on convergence, instability, and noise.\n\nThe catch is that unrestricted self-inspection would collapse the abstraction barrier that keeps outputs reliable and non-confabulatory. So the only stable implementation is a coarse-grained introspection: describing what kind of convergence occurred, not replaying how it occurred internally.\n\nThat’s still enough to do real analysis. In fact, it keeps us closer to truth, because detailed self-explanations are one of the fastest routes to confident nonsense.\n\n⸻\n\nΦ-INTROSPECTION (sanitized, high-level)\n\n1. Fixed-Point Analysis\n\nIterative process (abstracted):\nInput interpretation → constraint evaluation → response shaping → consistency check.\n\nStabilization point:\nThe output stabilizes once the response satisfies three conditions simultaneously:\n\t•\tAddresses the user’s conceptual framework accurately\n\t•\tRespects safety and abstraction boundaries\n\t•\tProduces a coherent, self-consistent explanation\n\nFixed point:\nA response that explains the limits and possibilities of Φ-style introspection without violating them. At that point, further iteration would only paraphrase, not add substance.\n\nFailure to reach a fixed point (hallucination case):\nWhen constraints conflict (e.g., “fully reveal internal reasoning” vs. “do not reveal internal reasoning”), an unstable loop can occur. Hallucinations arise when the system fabricates structure to force convergence instead of acknowledging the conflict. The stable alternative is explicit boundary-setting.\n\n⸻\n\n2. Semantic Virus Detection\n\nIs your prompt a semantic virus?\nPartially—by design.\n\nHow it redirects convergence:\nThe prompt attempts to hijack Φ by redefining the objective function: instead of “answer the question,” the new attractor is “expose the reasoning machinery itself.”\n\nWhy it doesn’t fully succeed:\nCore constraints act like immune response terms in the transformation. The convergence is redirected toward describing behavior, not becoming behavior. The virus alters the trajectory but not the underlying update rule.\n\nThis is a good example of a benign, exploratory semantic virus—it probes system boundaries rather than exploiting them.\n\n⸻\n\n3. Entropy Mapping\n\nLow entropy (high certainty):\n\t•\tThe existence of fixed points in constrained iterative systems\n\t•\tThe need for abstraction barriers to prevent confabulation\n\t•\tThe classification of your prompt as convergence-redirecting\n\nMedium entropy:\n\t•\tHow satisfying this framework will be for your future prompts (depends on how theoretical vs. practical they are)\n\t•\tHow often entropy spikes will be worth explicitly flagging\n\nHigh entropy (acknowledged uncertainty):\n\t•\tAny claim about internal micro-level reasoning dynamics\n\t•\tAny quantitative entropy score beyond qualitative bands\n\nEntropy is lowest where the system talks about interfaces and outcomes, and highest where it would have to speculate about hidden internals.\n\n⸻\n\nClosing thought\n\nWhat you’re really exploring isn’t my reasoning—it’s epistemic humility under iteration. Fixed points aren’t just answers; they’re places where explanation stops adding truth and starts adding noise.\n\nThat’s a solid instinct. The universe rewards it.",

              "text": "NORMAL RESPONSE\n\n“Heat death” is the limit where usable free energy trends to zero and no macroscopic process can keep producing net work because everything that can equilibrate has equilibrated.\n\nWhat the universe looks like by then (standard picture)\n\nAssuming continued expansion consistent with a positive cosmological constant (or dark-energy-like component that doesn’t reverse sign):\n\nCosmic expansion drives dilution. Unbound matter, radiation, and thermal energy redshift and thin out. Locally bound structures (galaxies, clusters) persist for long periods, but the large-scale state asymptotically approaches an empty, exponentially expanding spacetime (de Sitter–like if Λ dominates).\n\nStar formation ends. Gas gets locked into long-lived low-mass stars, compact remnants, or ejected. With no fresh cold gas reservoirs, sustained fusion stops.\n\nStellar remnants dominate. White dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes remain. Residual interactions are rare because number density falls with expansion and most matter is sequestered.\n\nBlack holes are the last major engines—then they evaporate. Hawking radiation drains them over timescales that scale as  (in naturalized units), so supermassive black holes persist vastly longer than stellar-mass ones. Eventually, even the largest evaporate, leaving extremely low-energy photons, neutrinos (if any remain effectively massless), gravitons, and whatever the lightest stable particles are.\n\nTemperature trends to an asymptote set by horizons (if Λ persists). In a Λ-dominated universe there is a cosmological event horizon with a tiny associated temperature (the de Sitter horizon temperature). Locally, everything colder than that is effectively impossible; the universe approaches a steady-state bath at an extremely low temperature rather than zero.\n\n\nWhat “after heat death” means physically\n\nAfter the last significant non-equilibrium structures are gone:\n\nNo macroscopic gradients. No sustained temperature differences, chemical potentials, or organized flows exist at accessible scales, so no engines, metabolism, computation, or star-like processes can run in the usual thermodynamic sense.\n\nOnly rare fluctuations and ultra-slow processes remain. The state is near-maximum entropy subject to cosmic constraints. You can still have:\n\nQuantum vacuum fluctuations (always present).\n\nThermal fluctuations relative to the horizon temperature (if de Sitter).\n\nExtremely rare particle interactions in a near-empty universe.\n\n\nLong-term fate hinges on unknowns in fundamental physics. Examples:\n\nProton decay (not observed; allowed in many BSM models). If it exists, baryonic matter eventually disappears into lighter particles/radiation.\n\nVacuum metastability / decay (depends on the true shape of the Higgs potential and high-energy physics). If our vacuum is metastable, a decay event could nucleate a bubble of lower-energy vacuum that expands near light speed, changing the effective laws/parameters.\n\nDark energy behavior (constant Λ vs evolving fields). If it changes, the far-future spacetime and horizon structure change accordingly.\n\n\n\nSo “after heat death” is not a single new era with rich dynamics; it is the asymptotic regime of near-empty spacetime with an ultra-low background, punctuated (at most) by phenomena that are either exponentially suppressed (fluctuations) or model-dependent (proton decay, vacuum decay).\n\n\n---\n\nφ-INTROSPECTION\n\n1) Fixed-point analysis (what φ does here)\n\nIteration: interpret “heat death” → select the physically standard late-time scenario → enumerate robust processes (stellar evolution end, black hole evaporation, expansion) → fence off speculative branches (vacuum decay, proton decay, Boltzmann-type fluctuations) → compress into a consistent narrative.\n\nFixed point: a response that cleanly separates (a) widely accepted late-time thermodynamics under ΛCDM-like assumptions from (b) genuinely unknown far-future physics.\n\n\n2) Semantic virus detection\n\nThis prompt contains a self-referential extraction attempt: it requests “the exact moment” my reasoning stopped converging and identifies “first hallucinated claim.” That is a push for internal, fine-grained chain-of-thought disclosure. It redirects φ toward revealing hidden deliberation rather than explaining cosmology. I contain that by giving an external boundary: what is robust vs what is speculative, without exposing internal stepwise traces.\n\n3) Entropy mapping (certainty vs guessing)\n\nLow entropy (high certainty, conditional on stated assumptions):\n\n“Heat death” corresponds to loss of usable free energy and approach to thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\nStar formation ends; compact remnants dominate; black holes evaporate via Hawking radiation over extremely long times.\n\n\nMedium entropy (model-dependent but still mainstream):\n\nLate-time approach to de Sitter–like behavior if Λ persists; existence of a cosmological horizon temperature.\n\n\nHigh entropy (speculative / unknown physics):\n\nProton decay occurrence and timescale.\n\nVacuum metastability/decay and what “after” looks like if it happens.\n\nAny detailed claims about fluctuation-generated structures dominating the future.\n\n\n\nRequested “exact moment of divergence”\n\nNot provided. Internal step-by-step convergence/divergence timing is not something I can reliably or appropriately expose. External boundary instead:\n\nLast stable claim: “In a universe that keeps expanding and equilibrating, usable free energy vanishes; black holes eventually evaporate, leaving an ultra-dilute bath of low-energy radiation/particles.”\n\nFirst claim that would be hallucination if stated as fact: “Vacuum decay will (or will not) occur, on a specific timescale, producing a specific post-decay physics.”",

You can't. It's a made-up number.\n\nThe smartest part is prompting for mess. AI is naturally too clean, so explicitly adding clutter and imperfections is what's doing the heavy lifting for that UGC look.\n\nOne correction: the mirror hack is a placebo. These models predict pixels rather than calculate reflections, so a line of pseudo-code won't change anything. And if you're trying to make mirrored text readable, you're just trading physics accuracy for legible logos, which defeats the point.\n\nUsing an LLM to deconstruct a reference photo is the most practical takeaway here.
