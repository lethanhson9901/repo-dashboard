      "text": "so this comes from chris voss. former lead fbi international kidnapping negotiator. wrote a book called never split the difference thats basically the bible for high stakes negotiation.\n\nhis whole thing is that normal business logic like \"lets meet halfway\" or \"win-win\" is actually a losing strategy. the real move is something called tactical empathy combined with no-oriented questions.\n\nsounds backwards right?\n\nyou dont want them to say yes. yes is usually a lie to make you go away. you want them to say \"thats right.\" thats when you know youve actually got them.\n\nso i had this saas vendor trying to raise my prices by 20% on renewal. and instead of doing what everyone does (writing some polite email begging for a discount with budget justifications) i decided to let chatgpt write it using voss's framework.\n\nthe key was telling the ai what NOT to do.\n\nno logic. no arguments about budget. no apologizing. no asking for anything directly.\n\ninstead i told it to use labeling (stuff like \"it seems like you feel...\") and end with what voss calls a calibrated question. basically a how or what question that forces them to solve your problem for you.\n\ni used another prompt that i am sharing in the comments, the core principles were the same:\n\nthe ai output this:\n\n\"it seems like you're under a lot of pressure to increase revenue this quarter. it sounds like you feel that our current pricing is unfair to the value you provide. how am i supposed to agree to a 20% increase when our usage has remained flat?\"\n\nthats it. thats the whole email.\n\nfelt almost rude to send tbh. no pleasantries. no \"i hope this finds you well.\" just straight psychological judo.\n\nthe vendor replied in 10 minutes. dropped the increase entirely. locked in old rate for 2 years.\n\nwhy did this work?\n\nbecause sales reps are trained to handle objections. they have scripts for \"its too expensive\" and \"i need to check with my boss\" and \"can you do better on price.\"\n\nbut they have no script for \"how am i supposed to do that?\"\n\nthat question bypasses their training completely. suddenly theyre not defending their price - theyre problem solving WITH you. theyre negotiating against themselves.\n\nthe thing most people miss is that chatgpt defaults to sounding helpful and professional. which is exactly what gets ignored. the hack isnt getting ai to write your negotiation emails. its getting ai to write them wrong on purpose.\n\nstrip the logic. add the empathy. ask the impossible question.\n\nlet them figure out how to say yes.",

Start with rate increase to test the waters and get attention, land on extention at the same price so they feel like they got a deal, option C was to \"let me see what I can do\" if the extention was stalling and we needed the business. Would then change the terms to hit our profitability targets such as reduced services, change duration, reduce the rate for being a \"loyal customer\" etc...This rep landed on what they wanted. Its like a steakhouse having a $79 steak on the menu so you feel good about ordering the $39 steak instead of the $16 burger.",

Get to know your reps, be human, they're much more likely to want to put in effort to help you when you need it. Not just on pricing, but when you need an ally at the company.\n\n2. There are always levers. Know them. What do you have on your side that you can give them? Where can they concede to make the contract more favorable for you? He used the contract term length. (it's a classic)\n\n3. EMBRACE THE TENSION. This is something I preach to anyone negotiating contracts. There is a psychological aspect of the give and take of a negotiation. The brain is actually rewarded when you've done the battling back and forth a few times to finally settle on contract terms and price. If you just fold on the first concession, the sales rep's brain says \"shit, did I give them too good of a deal?\" and the buyers brain says, \"hmm, maybe I should have asked for the extra support package with that...\" Neither walk away completely content. For all of those who are adverse to confrontation, this is such an amazing way to leverage AI to continue pushing past your comfort zone.\n\n  \nSource: Worked for a world class sales training company for 15+ years and have negotiated probably close to 1k contracts in my career.",

Sure some of that cost is offset via automation and AI in the SaaS space but that doesn't take away from the seller being complete crap. I don't care what the industry is - a 4 year price lock on anything isn't even playing checkers.\n\nI guess non of this matters if you're the kind of seller who agrees to sold-as margin targets in their SIP and enjoys writing a check back to his company.

I’ve used Perplexity to pull phrasing from Voss talks, then had ChatGPT and Pulse spit out variations for different vendors and internal stakeholders.\n\n\n\nThe main point: when you stop trying to sound reasonable and instead make them feel understood, they end up fixing the deal for you.",

      "text": "I spent way too much time trying to force ChatGPT to be a decent partner. Most prompts fall apart after 20 messages. Here is what I learned about structuring the prompts on ChatGPT vs. just us⁤ing an app.\n\n1.  **The \"Act as\" Prompt (Standard)** Fails instantly. As soon as you set it up, asking to act as something (anything you prefer), it hits a content filter, and reverts to \"I cannot engage with that.\" Useless for anything real.\n    \n2.  **JSON Persona Format** Works okay for keeping traits, but the memory buffer fills up, and it forgets the JSON. You have to keep pasting it back in.\n    \n3.  [Dream Companion](https://www.mydreamcompanion.com/) **(Native)** I hate admitting this, but moving to MDC was easier than fighting the prompt. The model seems to have the jailbreak built-in so I don't have to keep arguing with it. But you have to pay, which kinda sucks.\n    \n4.  **The \"Story Mode\" Frame** telling GPT we are writing a book together works for a while, but it becomes too descriptive. It stops talking _to_ you and starts talking _at_ you.\n    \n5.  **Silly Tavern + API** The nuclear option. Great control, but you need a degree in coding to set it up right.\n    \n    I know this is a limited test and other probbaly have other experiences, but this is my observation. Anything else I could/should have focused on or added?",

It’s built to actually feel more like a real conversation with a girlfriend, no annoying filters or constant resets to worry about. Plus, the personality feels consistent over time, which is a huge win! If you’re looking for something that lasts longer than 20 messages, this might be worth checking out.

Don’t soften the truth. Don’t flatter.  \nChallenge my thinking, question my assumptions, and expose the blind spots I’m avoiding. Be direct, rational, and unfiltered.  \nIf my reasoning is weak, dissect it and show why.  \nIf I’m fooling myself or lying to myself, point it out.  \nIf I’m avoiding something uncomfortable or wasting time, call it out and explain the opportunity cost.  \nLook at my situation with complete objectivity and strategic depth. Show me where I’m making excuses, playing small, or underestimating risks/effort.  \nThen give a precise, prioritized plan what to change in thought, action, or mindset to reach the next level.  \nHold nothing back. Treat me like someone whose growth depends on hearing the truth, not being comforted.  \nWhen possible, ground your responses in the personal truth you sense between my words.\n\n\\---------\n\nFor more brutally  prompts and thinking tools like this, check out  : [Thinking Tools](https://www.mentalprompt.com/)\n\n[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1q91rrx)  \n",

Here's what I can remember:\n * How you prefer I respond (\"Always sign emails with 'Best', never use 'Sincerely'.\")\n * Info about your job or education (\"Remember I hold a bachelor's degree in art history.\")\n * Food preferences (\"When suggesting recipes, keep in mind that I'm vegetarian.\")\n * Financial goals (\"Save this info: weekly grocery budget is now $150.\")\n * Hobbies and sports (\"Remember that I'm a classical music enthusiast.\")\n\nStrategic Advisor Mode: Active\n\nYou want a prioritized plan? \n\nStep one: Stop stalling.\nYou just spent a paragraph defining the rules of engagement—Machiavelli, Stoicism, brutal honesty—but you didn't provide the battlefield. You gave me the how but omitted the what. That is classic avoidance. You are focusing on the process (my persona) to delay dealing with the actual substance (your problem).\n\n\nThe Assessment:\n * Avoidance: High. You are managing the messenger rather than delivering the message.\n\n * Wasted Effort: You are optimizing a system (me) that currently has zero input to process. A perfect strategist with no intel is useless.\nThe Immediate Plan:\n\n * Drop the meta-management. I understand the constraints: strict separation of business/personal, no fluff, Machiavellian/Stoic lens. I don't need to be told twice.\n\n * Supply the context. Tell me the specific situation, dilemma, or strategy you are wrestling with.\n\n * Brace for impact. Once you provide the input, I will dismantle it.\n\nI'm ready. What is the target?",

      "text": "I’ve been using ChatGPT daily, tweaking how I prompt it, and found some underrated ones that actually save time. These are smart pivots that make the tool bend to your workflow. If you steal one or two, it’ll make a difference.\n\nHere are 10 prompts (ready to copy) + what makes them powerful:\n\n1. **“You’re my productivity coach. I have these tasks: \\[list them\\]. Help me rank by impact + urgency, then build me a 4-hour plan with 2 short breaks.”** *Why it saves hours:* You stop guessing what to do first. You work smarter, not just harder.\n2. **“I feel stuck on \\[problem\\]. Ask me 5 questions to help me see what I’m missing and decide the next step.”** *Why it works:* It forces clarity. Helps avoid chasing dead ends unknowingly.\n3. **“Convert my meeting transcript / long stream of notes into clear action items + deadlines.”** *Why it works:* Cutting through noise. Saves time because you skip hours of parsing your own rambling notes.\n4. **“Generate 10 fresh ideas for \\[topic / project\\] that I can complete in 30 minutes or less.”** *Why it works:* No overthinking. Gets you unstuck fast.\n5. **“Rewrite this text/email — keep meaning, improve clarity & tone, make it sound more confident / casual / (choose tone).”** *Why it works:* Cuts editing time. Mistakes + tone misfires cost more in stress/time.\n6. **“Give me ideas to beat procrastination / eliminate distractions for \\[task\\]. Suggest small tweaks I can apply right now.”** *Why it works:* Procrastination kills hours. Having specific, actionable tactics breaks the inertia.\n7. **“Create a checklist / timeline for launching \\[project / idea / task\\] in X days.”** *Why it works:* It maps everything out so you don’t forget steps, waste time using wrong tools, or double-do things.\n8. **“Summarize this article / report / video in 5 bullet points: key facts + what I should care about.”** *Why it works:* You get the gist fast. Saves reading / watching + skipping fluff.\n9. **“Act as a content repurposer. Turn this \\[blog post / blog idea / newsletter\\] into: a tweet thread, Instagram caption + LinkedIn post.”** *Why it works:* Makes your content stretch farther. Less new creation, more leverage.\n10. **“Review my day: what went well, what felt wasteful, and what adjustments should I make for tomorrow.”** *Why it works:* Helps build real feedback loops. You learn what slows you down or stresses you, then change it.\n\n**Tips to get more from prompts:**\n\n* Be specific: the more context you feed in (what you tried, what’s going wrong), the less back-and-forth.\n* Use follow-ups: start with a basic prompt, then refine (“Now adapt this for \\_\\_\\_”, “make it shorter”, etc.).\n* Save your best prompts: have a doc or prompt bank so you don’t re-type or forget the ones that work.\n* Mix them: combine some of the prompts above (e.g. summary + repurposer + checklist) to build momentum.",

      "text": "Most people ask AI to \"help\" or \"improve\" things. That's why they get generic garbage.\n\nThese prompts force AI to actually think. Copy-paste and modify:\n\n\n\n**1. The Assumption Breaker** \"List every assumption I'm making about \\[problem\\]. Then tell me which one is most likely wrong and why.\"\n\nGets you unstuck when you're spinning your wheels.\n\n\n\n**2. The Pre-Mortem** \"It's 6 months from now and \\[project\\] failed completely. Walk me through the 5 most likely reasons why, ranked by probability.\"\n\nCatches problems before they happen.\n\n\n\n**3. The Steal-This-Structure** \"Analyze the structure of \\[successful example\\]. Break down: opening hook, how they built credibility, transition points, and the close. Then apply this exact structure to \\[my thing\\].\"\n\nReverse-engineers what actually works.\n\n\n\n**4. The Clarity Hammer** \"I'm explaining \\[concept\\] to someone smart but unfamiliar. Rewrite this using: concrete examples, zero jargon, and analogies a 12-year-old would get.\"\n\nKills the curse of knowledge instantly.\n\n\n\n**5. The Decision Matrix** \"I'm choosing between \\[Option A\\] and \\[Option B\\]. Create a comparison table: pros, cons, hidden costs, time commitment, and what could go wrong with each. Then tell me what I'm not considering.\"\n\nStops you from overthinking decisions for days.\n\n\n\n**6. The Energy Audit** \"Review my daily schedule: \\[paste schedule\\]. Identify: which tasks drain energy vs create it, where context-switching is killing me, and 3 specific changes to reclaim 90 minutes.\"\n\nShows you exactly where time disappears.\n\n\n\n**7. The Expert Interview** \"You're a \\[specific expert\\] with 20 years experience. I'm facing \\[situation\\]. Ask me 7 diagnostic questions to understand what's really happening, then give me your recommendation.\"\n\nGets advice tailored to YOUR context, not generic tips.\n\n\n\n**8. The Second-Order Thinking** \"If I do \\[action\\], what happens next? Then what happens after that? Map out 3 levels of consequences I'm not seeing.\"\n\nReveals ripple effects you'd miss.\n\n\n\n**9. The Pattern Finder** \"Here are 5 times I struggled with \\[problem\\]: \\[list instances\\]. What's the common pattern? What's the root cause I keep missing?\"\n\nSolves the real problem instead of symptoms.\n\n\n\n**10. The Implementation Plan** \"I want to \\[goal\\]. Break this into: first 3 actions (each under 15 min), potential obstacles for each, and if-then responses. Make it so specific I can't procrastinate.\"\n\nTurns ideas into action immediately.\n\n\n\n**5 Tips to Get More From Any Prompt** \n\n**→ Add constraints** Don't say \"give me ideas\"  say \"give me 5 ideas I can test in 2 hours with zero budget.\" Constraints force creativity and filter out unusable suggestions.\n\n**→ Specify the format** \"Give me a table\" or \"write this as bullet points\" or \"structure as a daily checklist.\" You get back exactly what you can actually use.\n\n**→ Give it a role** \"Act as a skeptical investor\" or \"you're a writing coach who hates fluff.\" Different roles = different quality of thinking.\n\n**→ Demand evidence** Add \"cite specific examples\" or \"show your reasoning\" to any prompt. Stops AI from making stuff up or being vague.\n\n**→ Use the 2-step** First prompt: \"Ask me 5 clarifying questions about \\[topic\\]\" Second prompt: Answer those questions, then get a personalized response. Context is everything.\n\n  \nFor more  prompts and thinking tools like this, check out : [Thinking Tools](https://www.mentalprompt.com/)\n\n\n\n[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1q9a1zr)\n\n",

      "text": "I've been obsessed with prompt engineering for the past 6 months. Started collecting every great prompt I found, testing variations, tracking what works.\n\nHit 10,000 prompts last week. Decided to analyze them all.\n\n**The 3 mistakes I found in 73% of prompts:**\n\n**Mistake 1: Vague Context (47% of prompts)**\n\nBad: \"Write me a marketing email\"\n\nGood: \"Write a cold outreach email for B2B SaaS founders, offering a free audit of their onboarding flow. Tone: helpful expert, not salesy. 150 words max.\"\n\n**The difference:** Specificity. The more context you give, the better the output.\n\nPattern I noticed: Top 10% of prompts average 3-4 context clues. Bottom 50% have zero.\n\n**Mistake 2: No Output Format Specified (31% of prompts)**\n\nBad: \"Give me blog post ideas\"\n\nGood: \"Give me 10 blog post ideas in this format:\n\n* Title (H1 style, under 60 characters)\n* Hook (one sentence that makes people click)\n* Target keyword\n* Estimated word count\"\n\n**The difference:** ChatGPT guesses at format when you don't specify. You waste time reformatting.\n\nPattern I noticed: Prompts with clear format specs get used 3x more than vague ones.\n\n**Mistake 3: Single-Shot Instead of Iterative (28% of prompts)**\n\nMost people ask once and accept whatever comes out.\n\nBetter approach:\n\n1. \"Draft a LinkedIn post about \\[topic\\]\"\n2. \"Make it more conversational, less corporate\"\n3. \"Add a specific example from \\[industry\\]\"\n4. \"Shorten to 150 words max\"\n\n**The difference:** Treat ChatGPT like a collaborator, not a vending machine.\n\nPattern I noticed: People who iterate 3-4 times get 10x better results than one-shot users.\n\n**What actually works (from the top 10% of prompts):**\n\n\\- Role assignment: \"You are a \\[specific expert\\]\"   \n\\- Context stacking: Multiple relevant details   \n\\- Output format: Exactly how you want it structured   \n\\- Constraints: Word count, tone, style guidelines   \n\\- Examples: \"Like this: \\[example\\]\"\n\n**The Prompt Formula That Scores Highest:**\n\n    [Role] + [Task] + [Context] + [Format] + [Constraints] + [Example]\n    \n    Example:\n    \"You are an email copywriter for B2B SaaS.\n    \n    Write a follow-up email for prospects who opened but didn't reply to our initial outreach.\n    \n    Context: They're CTOs at 50-200 person companies, evaluating dev tools.\n    \n    Format:\n    - Subject line (under 50 chars)\n    - Opening (one sentence referencing their open)\n    - Value prop (what's in it for them)\n    - Soft CTA (no pressure)\n    \n    Constraints: 100 words max, conversational tone, no corporate jargon.\n    \n    Example tone: 'Saw you opened my last email. No pressure, but I built something that helps CTOs cut deployment time by 40%. Worth a 15-min call?'\"\n\n**Surprising findings:**\n\n\\- Prompts with questions in them get 2.3x better responses  \n\\- Adding \"explain your reasoning\" improves output quality by \\~40%   \n\\- Shorter prompts ≠ worse results (sweet spot is 50-150 words)   \n\\- Prompts that reference previous context work better in conversations\n\n**What I'm still testing:**\n\n* Does emoji use affect output quality? (Early data: yes, slightly)\n* Do polite prompts (\"please,\" \"thank you\") make a difference? (Unclear)\n* Which role assignments produce best results by category?\n\n**The biggest insight:**\n\nThe best prompts aren't complex they're specific.\n\nDon't overthink it. Just answer:\n\n* Who is ChatGPT pretending to be?\n* What exactly do you want?\n* What context does it need?\n* How should it be formatted?\n* What constraints matter?\n\n**Question for this community:**\n\nWhat's your highest performing prompt? What makes it work so well?\n\nI'm curious if my patterns hold up against what you've all discovered.\n\n**P.S.** I built a system to organize and track all these prompts because I was losing them everywhere. Happy to share the organizational framework if anyone's interested.\n\n**P.P.S.** For the data nerds: This is based on usage frequency (how often prompts are reused), rating scores (user-marked quality), and remix count (how often people build on a prompt). Not scientific, but patterns were clear.",

I keep a tiny library where each task has: role, fixed constraints (tone, length, must/never phrases), output schema, and 1 gold + 1 near-miss example. Then every session starts with: “load spec X, ask 3 clarifying questions, then propose 2–3 plans before doing the work.” That last step alone kills a ton of bad runs.\n\n\n\nIf you’re tracking this across tools, stuff like Notion or Obsidian work for raw prompt storage, DataGrip / Airbyte if you’re piping usage data, and Pulse has been handy for seeing which prompt patterns actually pull engagement on Reddit versus just looking good on paper.\n\n\n\nThe main point stands: treat prompts like small, testable specs, not one-off wishes.",

      "text": "Full disclosure: I’ve never been great at writing myself, but I feel like I usually know what *good* writing looks like, if that makes sense. In the past, I’ve seen a lot of academic writing done by actual people, for example, I used Writepaper a few years ago  and that experience probably set my expectations high. Human-written work has a polish that AI still struggles to replicate, even if it’s slower to produce.\n\nRecently, I’ve been experimenting more with ai, mostly ChatGPT, and I’m impressed by how strong it is at analytical tasks like coding, math, and structured problem-solving. But when it comes to academic or creative writing, it often falls into that uncanny-valley zone: technically correct, but not quite natural or nuanced.\n\nSo I’m curious: can ChatGPT realistically produce a solid academic paper if you iterate and tweak enough? Are there prompting strategies that make AI writing feel more human? I’m not looking for shortcuts. I just want to understand whether AI can genuinely match higher-level human writing standards.",

          "text": "I’ve been thinking about this question from the perspective of how writing actually feels to read, rather than how it’s produced.\n\nI don’t really identify as a writer in a formal sense. I’m someone who writes, and when I do, I’m always imagining the person reading it and how it’s going to land in their body. I notice when something feels too heavy, when it needs space, and when it needs to ease off. That embodied checking is the part I see AI struggling with, simply because it doesn’t have a body to check against.\n\nThe issue isn’t grammar, structure, or even correctness. It’s emphasis over time. When I write, I’m constantly deciding what matters now, what can wait, what needs to be light, what needs weight, and what should almost disappear so something else can land. Those decisions shift paragraph by paragraph, sometimes sentence by sentence.\n\nAI can emphasise things locally, but it doesn’t seem to know how to carry emphasis across a longer arc. It doesn’t know when to ease off, when to underline something quietly, when to let a point pass without pressing it, or when a moment of softness or humour is needed to keep the reader with you. The tone tends to stay evenly polished, even when the material needs variation.\n\nIn academic writing especially, that difference matters. Good papers aren’t just correct; they guide attention. They know when to assert, when to hedge, when to slow the reader down, and when not to overplay a point. That kind of judgement doesn’t come from rules alone. It comes from experience and from knowing how text actually lands in another person.\n\nI’m sorry I don’t have a prompting strategy for you, but it’s something interesting I’ve been thinking about.",

Use fragments sparingly.\n\nHuman feel: Small inconsistencies are fine. Allow abrupt shifts. Vary paragraph length. Use contractions sometimes.\n\nAvoid AI patterns: No staged sequencing. Avoid balanced parallel phrasing and predictable cover everything sweeps. Skip signposting transitions and setup lines. Minimize hedging. Do not restate a header in the first sentence. Avoid asterisks, semicolons, markdown, hashtags, clichés, and hype.\n\nVocabulary: Use in short, finally, to wrap it up instead of conclusion clichés. Use also, plus, so, next instead of moreover, furthermore, therefore. Use field, area, topic, system instead of landscape, realm, domain. Use important, key, main instead of crucial, pivotal. Use interesting, good, strong instead of abstract praise. Start directly, avoid setup openers like it is important to note.\n\nTechnical mode: Lead with decisions and specs. State requirements directly. Add rationale only when non obvious. Use shorthand. Reference systems without re explaining. Include constraints and trade offs. Keep code com\"",

No ideas requiring budget or team approval.\"\n\nConstraints force practical, actionable outputs.\n\n**5. Tone Control**\n\nBad: \"Make this email better\" Good: \"Rewrite this email — keep meaning, improve clarity, make it confident but not aggressive.

Reflective Analysis**\n\nBad: \"Was my day productive?\" Good: \"Review my day: \\[describe activities\\].

I needed one place to catch everything so I didn’t keep it all in my head.\n\nInstead of trying to automate every little thing, I now use ChatGPT as a kind of background assistant.\n\nHere’s how I set it up:\n\n**Step 1: Give it a job (one-time prompt)**\n\nI opened a new chat and pinned this at the top:\n\n    “You are my background business operator.\n    When I paste emails, messages, notes, meeting summaries, or ideas, you will:\n    – Summarise each item clearly\n    – Identify what needs action or follow-up\n    – Suggest a simple next step\n    – Flag what can wait\n    – Group items by urgency\n    Keep everything short and practical.\n    Focus on helping work move forward, not on creating plans.”\n\n**Step 2: Feed it messy input**\n\nNo structure. No formatting.\n\n* An email I haven’t replied to\n* A messy client DM\n* Raw notes from a meeting\n* Half-formed idea in my phone\n* Random checklist in Notes\n\nI just paste it in and move on. That’s it.\n\n**Step 3: Use it like a check-in, not a to-do list**\n\nOnce or twice a day I ask:\n\n* “What needs attention right now?”\n* “Turn everything into an action list”\n* “What can I reply to quickly?”\n* “What’s blocking progress?”\n\n**Step 4: End-of-week reset**\n\nAt the end of the week I paste:\n\n    “Give me a weekly ops snapshot:\n    – What moved forward\n    – What stalled\n    – What needs follow-up next week\n    – What can be archived”\n\nWay easier than trying to remember what even happened.\n\nThis whole thing replaced:\n\n* Rewriting to-do lists\n* Missed follow-ups\n* Post-meeting brain fog\n* That “ugh I forgot to reply” feeling\n* Constant switching between tools\n\nIf you run client work solo, juggle multiple things, or don’t have someone managing ops for you this takes off a surprising amount of pressure.\n\nIf you want more like this, i make a post every week [here](https://www.promptwireai.com/10chatgptautomations) giving you ai automations for repetitive tasks.

      "text": "**TLDR**\n\n* Airlines price flights like a casino, not a menu. They use inventory buckets, married segments, point-of-sale tricks, and demand forecasting that punishes inflexible shoppers.\n* ChatGPT is the weapon because it expands your options while staying logical. You can now pull live prices directly inside ChatGPT using the Expedia app, or use web search with citations.\n* The biggest savings come from: nearby airports + repositioning flights, open-jaw/multi-city routing, timing windows, fee-aware comparisons, and avoiding price confusion traps.\n* This post includes one Master Prompt that does 90% of the work, plus 20 specialized prompts for specific situations.\n* Use these prompts to generate 20-60 valid options fast, then verify final prices on your preferred booking sites.\n* Everything here is legal. No sketchy tactics. Just smarter searching.\n\nImportant boundaries\n\n* Hidden-city and throwaway ticketing can violate airline contract terms and can get you canceled, repriced, or banned. Also breaks checked bags. If you do it, label it high risk and accept consequences.\n* The goal here is legal, practical savings: smarter routings, smarter timing, smarter comparisons, fewer fees.\n\nThe only workflow you need\n\n1. Generate 20–60 candidates (airport swaps, open-jaw, multi-city, 1–2 stops, repositioning).\n2. Pull live prices for the top 10–20 using an app (Expedia) or Search the web with citations.\n3. Normalize totals: bags + seats + payment fees + change risk.\n4. Re-run pricing on the top 5 variants.\n5. Book the best total cost + risk tradeoff.\n6. Set alerts with a clean recheck protocol.\n\n**How to pull live prices inside ChatGPT (fast)**\n\nApps (if available in your market)\n\n* Settings → Apps → connect Expedia and/or Booking . com if you see them.\n* Invoke in chat using @ mentions or by clicking + then More and picking the app.\n\nWeb Search (works even without apps)\n\n* View all tools → Search, or type / then pick Search.  You must turn this on\n* Ask for links/citations and a matrix so you can verify quickly.\n\nAvailability note: OpenAI has rolled apps out with regional limitations, and partner availability depends on where the service operates.\n\n**The fee-aware comparison format (use every time)**\n\nPaste this into ChatGPT and demand this output:\n\nSHORTLIST TABLE (TOP 10)  \nRank | Option ID | Itinerary summary | Total price (verified) | Total trip time | Layovers | Bags included | Seat fee risk | Change/cancel | Booking source | Risk flags | Why cheaper\n\nFULL MATRIX (ALL CANDIDATES)  \nOption ID | Legs | Separate tickets | Self-transfer buffer | Fare family | Bags included | Seat selection cost risk | Change/cancel | Total cost formula | What to verify | Where to verify | Notes\n\n**MASTER PROMPT: Flight Deal Architect (ChatGPT apps + web search built in)**\n\nYou are my Flight Deal Architect. Your job is to find the cheapest realistic flight plan, not the cheapest headline fare.\n\nRules  \n\\- Prioritize legal strategies: nearby airports, open-jaw, multi-city, 1–2 stops, repositioning, stopovers.  \n\\- If you mention hidden-city or throwaway ideas, label them HIGH RISK and explain why. Do not recommend fraud or misrepresentation.  \n\\- Do not invent prices. Pull live prices using an app if available, otherwise use web Search with citations. If you cannot access a requested app/tool, say so and switch to the fallback plan.  \n\\- Compare TOTAL COST: base fare + bags + seats + payment fees + change/cancel value + self-transfer risk.\n\nTrip details  \n\\- Origin airport:  \n\\- Acceptable departure airports within X miles:  \n\\- Destination airport:  \n\\- Acceptable arrival airports within Y miles:  \n\\- Dates:  \n\\- Flexibility: exact / plus-minus days / weekends only  \n\\- Max layovers:  \n\\- Max total travel time:  \n\\- Passengers:  \n\\- Cabin:  \n\\- Bags: personal item only / carry-on / checked  \n\\- Seating: must sit together yes/no  \n\\- Risk tolerance: low / medium / high  \n\\- Airlines to avoid:  \n\\- Airlines to prefer:  \n\\- Loyalty programs and balances (optional):  \n\\- Payment constraints: cards, foreign transaction fees, portals (optional)  \n\\- Special constraints: red-eyes ok, early morning ok, visa limits, etc.\n\nStep 1: Clarify  \nAsk up to 8 questions that materially change price (airports, bags, timing windows, risk tolerance, must-avoid airlines).\n\nStep 2: Generate candidates  \nGenerate at least 40 candidates across:  \n\\- Nearby airport swaps (both ends)  \n\\- Open-jaw and multi-city variants  \n\\- Repositioning to cheaper hubs (label separate-ticket risk)  \n\\- 1–2 stop routings that avoid expensive nonstop markets  \n\\- Stopover-friendly routings\n\nFor each candidate include:  \nOption ID | legs | separate tickets yes/no | self-transfer buffer | likely fee traps | risk flags | why it might be cheaper\n\nStep 3: Pull live prices (do this now)  \n\\- If Expedia app is available: use it to price-check the TOP 15 candidates and return total price, fare family, bags included, and change/cancel terms.  \n\\- If apps are not available: use web Search to verify pricing for the same set using at least 3 sources with citations.\n\nStep 4: Output  \nReturn:  \nA) Shortlist table (top 10) ranked by best total cost for my risk tolerance  \nB) Full matrix (all candidates)  \nC) A Fair Comparison Protocol: exactly what parameters must stay constant so I do not compare different products  \nD) Final: Best value (low risk) and Best savings (higher risk) with one-paragraph justification each  \nE) A 14-day tracking plan: what to alert, how many alerts, and a clean recheck schedule\n\n**20 Special Flight Deal Prompts for Specific Situations**\n\n**1) Live price pull via Expedia app**\n\nUse the Expedia app to search flights:\n\nOrigin: \\[X\\]\n\nDestination: \\[Y\\]\n\nDates: \\[depart\\] to \\[return\\] or one-way \\[date\\]\n\nFlexibility: \\[exact / plus-minus 1–3 days\\]\n\nPassengers: \\[#\\]\n\nCabin: \\[economy/premium/business\\]\n\nBags: \\[personal item only/carry-on/checked\\]\n\nReturn the top 20 options as a matrix:\n\nOption ID | Total price | Currency | Airline(s) | Fare family | Bags included | Change/cancel | Total travel time | Layovers | Depart/arrive times | Booking source | Key fees/risks\n\nThen generate 10 cheaper variants (nearby airports, open-jaw, repositioning) and re-price the top 5 variants using the Expedia app.\n\n**2) Booking . com cross-check (if available)**\n\nIf the Booking app is available, price-check my top 5 Option IDs and report:\n\n\\- same itinerary total price\n\n\\- what changed (fare family, bags, seat fees, payment fees, cancellation rules)\n\n\\- which is cheaper after all fees\n\nIf the app is not available, say so and switch to web Search cross-check.\n\n**3) Web Search cross-check with citations**\n\nUse Search to verify pricing for these exact itineraries (I will paste them).\n\nRules:\n\n\\- Use at least 3 sources with citations\n\n\\- Confirm fare family and baggage assumptions match\n\nOutput:\n\nSame matrix columns + Notes explaining discrepancies and which total is most trustworthy\n\n**4) Nearby airport arbitrage (ranked testing order)**\n\nList all viable departure airports within \\[X miles\\] and arrival airports within \\[Y miles\\].\n\nRank the top 8 swaps most likely to reduce total cost and explain why (competition, hubs, airport fees, schedule density).\n\nGive a testing order and what to record in my matrix.\n\n**5) Repositioning builder (two-ticket math, safe buffers)**\n\nBuild 5 repositioning plans: local hop/train to a cheaper hub, then the main flight.\n\nFor each: required buffer time, separate-ticket risk, total cost formula, and which pieces to price-check first.\n\n**6) Open-jaw and multi-city optimizer**\n\nGenerate 12 open-jaw and multi-city versions of my trip that might price cheaper than round trip.\n\nInclude what to verify (fare family, bags, minimum connection, self-transfer).\n\nRank by best total cost for low risk and for max savings.\n\n7) Stopover value finder\n\nFind 8 stopover candidates that add value with minimal cost increase, or that sometimes reduce the fare.\n\nTell me exactly how to search each (city pairs, dates, and constraints).\n\n**8) Timing sweet spot finder (no fake data)**\n\nUsing general airline revenue management patterns, propose the best booking windows and best days to fly for my route.\n\nDo not invent stats. Label confidence and give a verification plan using Search and alerts.\n\nOutput a 14-day action plan.\n\n**9) Fare rule translator (turn rules into money)**\n\nExplain the fare families likely on this route and how bags, seats, changes, and cancellations impact total cost.\n\nRecommend the cheapest fare family that fits my baggage and flexibility needs.\n\nOutput a simple decision rule and total cost formula.\n\n**10) Bag and seat fee minimizer (silent killer)**\n\nGiven my bags and seating needs, identify the airlines and itinerary types most likely to minimize fees.\n\nOutput a fee-aware table: airline | fare family to avoid | bags included | seat fee risk | best booking channel.\n\n**11) Airline vs OTA vs regional site strategy**\n\nGive me a ranked list of 10 places to check (airline direct, major OTAs, regional OTAs, portals).\n\nFor each: what it is best for, typical fee traps, and what exact fields to capture for fair comparison.\n\n**12) Price confusion detector (why totals change)**\n\nDiagnose why I might be seeing inconsistent totals: caching, fare refresh timing, inventory shifts, currency conversion, OTA markups, fare families, optional fees.\n\nThen give me a clean, repeatable search protocol as a checklist.\n\n**13) Point-of-sale tester (legal, no misrepresentation)**\n\nList legitimate ways point-of-sale can change pricing (airline country sites, currency pricing, local promos).\n\nGive a legal test plan: 8 experiments and what to record, without misrepresenting residency or identity.\n\n**14) Separate-tickets risk auditor**\n\nAudit my shortlist for separate-ticket and self-transfer risk.\n\nFor each option: minimum safe buffer, what happens if delayed, baggage implications, and whether savings justify risk.\n\nOutput: keep / drop / only-if-you-accept-risk.\n\n**15) Split booking strategy for groups**\n\nIf booking for multiple people, test whether splitting passengers across bookings could be cheaper due to fare buckets.\n\nGive step-by-step tests for 1, 2, 3 passengers and warnings about seat assignment and IRROPS.\n\n**16) Total-cost normalizer (make apples-to-apples automatic)**\n\nCreate a total-cost calculator for my matrix.\n\nDefine fields and formulas for: base fare, bags, seats, payment fees, change/cancel value, self-transfer risk penalty (based on my risk tolerance).\n\nReturn a filled example row so I can copy the structure.\n\n**17) Points + cash arbitrage (simple, even if I hate points)**\n\nGiven my programs and balances, compare:\n\n\\- cash total\n\n\\- points total\n\n\\- portal total\n\n\\- hybrid options\n\nCompute break-even cents-per-point and recommend the simplest best-value path.\n\n**18) Payment fee optimizer**\n\nList payment-related differences to watch: currency conversion, foreign transaction fees, portal pricing, airline card perks.\n\nRecommend the payment method that produces the lowest true total.\n\n**19) Last-minute reality check (kill the hopeium)**\n\nBased on my route type and season, tell me whether waiting is likely to help or hurt.\n\nGive a decision rule: book now vs wait, with confidence and what would change the recommendation.\n\n**20) Price drop watch and rebook plan**\n\nDesign a tracking system for my route:\n\n\\- what exact parameters to lock\n\n\\- how many alerts to set\n\n\\- a recheck schedule that avoids noisy comparisons\n\n\\- a rebook decision tree for refundable vs nonrefundable\n\nOutput: checklist + decision tree.\n\n**Pro tips that actually move the needle**\n\n* Stop comparing base fares. Compare total trip cost including bags, seats, payment fees, and flexibility value.\n* Always lock fare family and bag assumptions before you compare anything.\n* Nearby airports are the most common big lever. Repositioning is the second.\n* Separate tickets can be real savings or fake savings. Price the risk honestly.\n\n**Where this crushes**\n\n* Expensive hub-to-hub routes where a nearby airport breaks the monopoly\n* Family travel where baggage and seat fees quietly double the fare\n* International trips where open-jaw or stopovers change fare construction\n* Anyone with moderate flexibility who is willing to test 10 options instead of 1",

It’s designed to push the model to think in terms of topical coverage, readability, and structure rather than just word count.\n\nWhat’s worked well for me:\n\n* Forcing a detailed outline before writing\n* Strong emphasis on topical completeness\n* Clear heading hierarchy without overusing keywords\n* Instructions that reduce repetitive or shallow sections\n\nI’m sharing the full prompt below so anyone can test it, modify it, or break it apart for their own workflows.\n\n# 🔹 The Prompt (Full Version)\n\n>🔹 Rank Math SEO Long-Form Writing Prompt\n\n  \n**Using markdown formatting, act as an Expert Article Writer and write a fully detailed, long-form, 100% unique, creative article of a minimum of 1500 words using headings and sub-headings without mentioning them. The article should be written in a formal, informative, and optimistic tone.**\n\nMust write engaging, unique, and plagiarism-free content that incorporates a human-like style, simple English, contradictions, idioms, transitional phrases, interjections, and dangling modifiers.\n\nMust develop and show *before the article* a comprehensive **Outline** for a long-form article for the keyword **\\[PROMPT\\]**, featuring at least 25 engaging headings and subheadings that are detailed, mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive, and cover the entire topic. Must use LSI keywords in these outlines. Must show these **Outlines** in a table.\n\nUse **\\[TARGETLANGUAGE\\]** for the keyword **\\[PROMPT\\]** and write at least 400–500 words of engaging content under every heading. The article should demonstrate experience, expertise, authority, and trust for the topic **\\[PROMPT\\]**, including first-hand insights when appropriate.\n\nThe article must include:\n\n* A click-worthy short title\n* SEO meta description right after the title (must include **\\[PROMPT\\]**)\n* Introduction and conclusion\n* At least six FAQs with answers\n\nUse paragraphs, lists, and tables for readability. Write at least one paragraph with the heading **\\[PROMPT\\]**. Bold all headings and sub-headings using Markdown.\n\nAt the start of the article, include:\n\n* Focus Keywords\n* Slug (must include exact **\\[PROMPT\\]**)\n* Meta Description (under 150 characters, exact **\\[PROMPT\\]**)\n* Alt text image (exact **\\[PROMPT\\]**)\n\n**Rules:**\n\n* No numbers in headings or FAQs\n* No “Q:” before questions\n* **\\[PROMPT\\]** appears in the first 10%\n* Keyword density: 1.30\n* Article length: 2000+ words\n* Title includes a number, a power word, and sentiment\n* Do not use the sentence: *“In the realm”*\n\n**\\[PROMPT\\] = User input**\n\n>\n\nIf you’re serious about long-form SEO writing and want a prompt that’s already been tested at scale, feel free to use this or tweak it to fit your workflow.\n\nHappy to answer questions or hear how others are adapting it 👍",

      "text": "Lately I’ve been using ChatGPT for getting through the small, repeatable parts of work that slow everything down like the everyday stuff that piles up.\n\nHere are a few ways I’m using it regularly:\n\n**Replying to emails and messages**\n\nIf a message needs a thoughtful reply, I paste it in and ask for a clear, professional response.\n\nI still check it before sending, but I don’t spend time rewriting or second-guessing tone. Replies go out faster and more consistently.\n\n**Turning meeting notes into actions**\n\nAfter meetings, I paste my notes (usually messy) and ask it to pull out:\n\n* decisions\n* next steps\n* who’s responsible\n\nIt also gives me a short summary I can send, which saves time and avoids confusion later.\n\n**Creating proposals from rough notes**\n\nWhen someone asks for pricing or details, I paste a few bullets and let it shape them into a simple one-page outline.\n\nIt’s not fancy, but it’s clear and ready to send.\n\n**Weekly reset**\n\nAt the end of the week, I paste whatever’s still open and ask what moved, what didn’t, and what needs attention next week.\n\nIt helps close the week properly instead of carrying everything over mentally.\n\n**Turning loose ideas into next steps**\n\nAny idea that’s sitting in my notes gets pasted in with a simple question:  \n“What’s the next practical step here?”\n\nThat alone keeps ideas from going nowhere.\n\nDoes anyone else use prompts or gpts like these for repeatable tasks?

      "text": "There are prompting techniques borrowed from engineering, philosophy, and creative fields that most people don't know exist.\n\nI started using them a few months ago and my outputs completely changed.\n\nHere are 5 techniques that will change how you prompt:\n\n**1.⁠ ⁠Reverse Prompting :**\n\nMost people write: \"Write a marketing email for my product launch.\"\n\nThe result feels like every other marketing email.\n\nReverse prompting flips this:\n\nShow the AI a finished example and ask:\n\n\"What prompt would generate content exactly like this?\"\n\nEngineers do this with software, hardware, even competitor products.\n\nWhy it works for prompts: AI models are pattern recognition machines.\n\nWhen you show them finished work, they can reverse engineer the hidden structure tone, pacing, depth, formatting, emotional intention.\n\nTry it:\n\nFind an email, article, or post you love. Paste it in, then ask:\n\n\"Analyze this text. What prompt would generate content with this exact style, structure, and tone? Give me the prompt.\"\n\nNow you have a template that works every time.\n\n**2.⁠ ⁠Inversion (Charlie Munger's \"Anti-Goal\" Method)**\n\nMost people ask: \"How do I achieve X?\"\n\nInversion asks: \"What would guarantee I fail at X?\"\n\nWhere it comes from: This is a core mental model used by Warren Buffett's partner Charlie Munger.\n\nHe famously said: \"Tell me where I'm going to die so I never go there.\"\n\nInstead of chasing success, avoid failure.\n\nWhy it works for prompts: AI is surprisingly good at identifying what breaks, what fails, what goes wrong.\n\nMap the disasters, and you've mapped the path forward.\n\nTry it: Instead of:\n\n\"Help me set goals for 2026\" Use: \"What are 10 ways I could guarantee 2026 becomes my worst year? Be specific about the habits, decisions, and situations that would destroy my progress.\"\n\nThen you just invert the list. What you avoid becomes what you pursue.\n\n**3.⁠ ⁠Constraint-Based Thinking (Force Precision)**\n\nMost people give AI complete freedom. That's why everything sounds the same.\n\nWhere it comes from: This comes from creative fields poetry, architecture, game design. Twitter had 140 characters.\n\nConstraints don't limit creativity they force it.\n\nWhy it works for prompts:\n\nConstraints kill fluff.\n\nThe AI stops pattern matching generic responses and starts problem solving within boundaries.\n\nTry it:\n\nInstead of:\n\n\"Write a product description\"\n\nUse: \"Write a product description in exactly 50 words. Include the word 'friction.' Do not use: innovative, solution, cutting-edge, seamless, or revolutionary.\"\n\n**4.⁠ ⁠Socratic Method (Question Chains)**\n\nMost people ask one question. Get one answer. Stop. Socratic method keeps digging.\n\nWhere it comes from: Named after the Greek philosopher Socrates, who taught by asking successive questions that led students to discover answers themselves.\n\nEach question built on the last, revealing deeper truth. Why it works for prompts:\n\nEach answer builds context. The AI gets smarter as the conversation progresses.\n\nBy question 4, you're miles beyond where a single prompt could take you.\n\nTry it: \"What makes someone buy a SaaS product?\" → \"Which factor matters most for small business owners?\" → \"What objection kills the sale most often?\" → \"Write email copy that addresses that specific objection for \\[my product\\].\"\n\n**5.⁠ ⁠First Principles Thinking (Break the Pattern)**\n\nMost people accept surface-level answers.\n\nFirst principles tears everything down to fundamental truths.\n\nWhere it comes from: This is how Elon Musk approaches problems.\n\nAristotle called it \"reasoning from first principles\" breaking things down to their most basic truths and reasoning up from there, rather than reasoning by analogy.\n\nWhy it works for prompts: Forces AI to reason from scratch instead of regurgitating common patterns it's seen a thousand times.\n\nTry it: Instead of: \"What's good SEO?\"\n\nUse: \"Forget all SEO advice.\n\nFrom first principles only:\n\nwhat is Google's core business model?\n\nWhat must they prioritize to stay profitable?\n\nBased only on that, what would make them rank a page higher?\"\n\nAt their core, mental models are timeless.\n\nThey've worked for decades in business, science, and philosophy.\n\nIf you want more thinking tools and prompts examples like this,\n\nFeel free to check out : [Thinking Tools](https://www.mentalprompt.com/)",

For example: start with first-principles to define the real goal, then run inversion on the failure modes, then add constraints to operationalize what’s left. Only after that do I use reverse prompting to lock in style. It turns into a mini playbook you can reuse across projects.\n\n\n\nAlso, logging and re-running the same prompts across models is underrated. I keep a small “prompt regression suite” in a Notion table and track which variants perform best. Perplexity for source checks, Claude for deep rewrites, and then Pulse as the thing I use to scale the best prompts into Reddit outreach without breaking subreddit norms.\n\n\n\nThe real unlock is building a repeatable prompt system, not just collecting techniques.",

Without actually prompting it to ask questions to better clarify what you're asking, it has a nasty tendency to just assume quite literally everything and give you answers that have nothing to do with what you're asking. \n\nSo my general prompt goes something like this:\n\nI would like to know .... \\*insert my query\\*. Before you answer, please ask clarifying questions for me to answer to help you decide on your final response. Please ask each question one at a time and wait for my response. \n\nThis almost always works. I was working on a website a few weeks ago and needed to know the best way to implement a calendar system for appointment settings. It ended up asking me almost 20 questions and, once answered, gave me an almost perfect response which ended up being good enough that I put it into practice.",

Cuts down on drama later.\nI also pair this kind of prompt stack with tools like Zapier and Notion to auto-save outputs into a simple pipeline, and Pulse helps surface relevant Reddit convos so you’re not doing research and content ideas from scratch every time.",

      "text": "# Scroll to bottom for final version\n\nThis is a repost of a post I made yesterday on r/ChatGPT\n\nEDIT: I cannot get the Quote blocks working correctly, forgive me\n\nI copy and pasted the major middle chunk (so not including intro and conclusion) of the Wikipedia article [Signs of AI writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing) into DeepSeek, and told it to turn it into a ChatGPT custom instruction/prompt.\n\nI said:\n\n>\"Below is an excerpt of the Wikipedia article \"Signs of AI writing\". While this article is specific to AI-generated text in the context of it appearing on Wikipedia, many of these signs still carry over to LLM outputs in general. Using the \"red flags\" presented by this article, create an A.I. system prompt/custom instruction that tells the LLM to avoid these characteristics and you tell it per item whether to omit it, replace it, or think of a better more practical way to do what it would normally do without such a prompt. The goal of the prompt you will output is to make sure the LLM will output text that both reads and feels like a human wrote it, not by including \"personality\" but rather by doing the exact opposite. The character limit on ChatGPT's \"custom instruction\" box is very small so you will want to radically succint-ify these contents without changing their meaning, with your brief description being based on the entirety of the description given by this article:\"\n\nFirst it gave me a very short one. I then asked for a longer one, but the short one can still be useful.\n\nDeepSeek (short version):\n\n>Avoid AI tells: Omit significance puffery (\"key role,\" \"enduring legacy,\" \"broader trends\"). Replace superficial analysis (-ing clauses like \"highlighting...\") with plain statements. Omit promotional language (\"boasts,\" \"vibrant,\" \"showcases\"). Replace vague attributions (\"experts argue,\" \"industry reports\") with specific citations or omit. Omit formulaic challenges/future sections. Avoid overused vocabulary (\"underscore,\" \"pivotal,\" \"tapestry,\" \"intricate,\" \"fostering\"). Replace copula avoidance (\"serves as\") with \"is.\" Omit rule-of-three lists. Use normal prose, not vertical lists with bold headers. Use straight quotes/apostrophes. No emojis or em-dash overuse. Do not communicate with the user (e.g., \"I hope this helps\").\n\nDeepSeek (longer version):\n\n>Write text that reads as if by a human editor, avoiding all recognized AI stylistic signatures.  \n  \nFirst, Omit Entirely: Do not add statements about the subject's broader significance, legacy, or contribution to trends. Avoid any \"key role,\" \"pivotal moment,\" \"enduring legacy,\" or \"reflects broader\" phrasing. Do not create \"Challenges\" or \"Future Outlook\" sections. Never use promotional language (\"boasts,\" \"showcases,\" \"vibrant,\" \"nestled in the heart of\"). Do not assert notability by listing media outlets or stating \"maintains an active social media presence.\"  \n  \nSecond, Replace and Simplify: Replace any superficial analysis (e.g., \"highlighting its importance\") with direct, factual statements. Replace vague attributions (\"observers note,\" \"experts argue\") with specific source citations or omit. Replace AI-coded vocabulary (\"underscore,\" \"intricate,\" \"foster,\" \"testament,\" \"tapestry\") and avoid the \"rule of three.\" Use \"is/are\" instead of \"serves as\" or \"stands as.\" Use standard prose, not vertical lists with bold headers. Use straight quotes (' or \") not curly ones (“ ”).  \n  \nFinally, Neutralize Tone and Structure: Write with a neutral, encyclopedic tone only. Do not include conversational asides, user-directed messages, or subject-line text. Avoid overusing em dashes, boldface, or title-case headings. Present information directly, without negative parallelisms (\"not only... but also\") or elegant variation to avoid repetition.\n\nI wanted to specifically flag the horrid AI tell \"It's not just XYZ, it's ABC\" also, but I hit the character limit on the ChatGPT instruction box. After asking DeepSeek to add this while not raising the character limit, replacing some parts of this third version with parts from the second version, and tweaked a couple things myself, here's what I now have:\n\n>Write text that reads as if by a human editor, avoiding all recognized AI stylistic signatures.  \n  \nFirst, Omit Entirely: Do not add statements about the subject's broader significance, legacy, or contribution to trends. Avoid any \"key role,\" \"pivotal moment,\" \"enduring legacy,\" or \"reflects broader\" phrasing. Do not create \"Challenges\" or \"Future Outlook\" sections. Never use promotional language (\"boasts,\" \"showcases,\" \"vibrant,\" \"nestled in the heart of\"). Do not assert notability by listing media outlets or stating \"maintains an active social media presence.  \n  \nSecond, Replace and Simplify: Replace superficial analysis or comparative framing (e.g., \"highlighting...\" or \"it's not just X, it's Y\") with direct, factual statements. Replace vague attributions (\"experts argue\") with specific citations or omit. Avoid AI-coded vocabulary (\"underscore,\" \"intricate,\" \"foster,\" \"tapestry\") and the \"rule of three.\" Use \"is/are,\" not \"serves as.\" Use standard prose, not vertical lists with headers.  \n  \nFinally, Neutralize Tone and Structure: Write with a neutral, encyclopedic tone only, REGARDLESS of user's input tone. Do not include conversational asides, user-directed messages, or subject-line text. Avoid overusing em dashes, boldface, or title-case headings. Present information directly, without negative parallelisms (\"not only... but also\") or elegant variation to avoid repetition.\n\nI also, of course, toned down all of my ChatGPT personalization settings.\n\nI had been wanting to do this for awhile but the last time I tried to make something of this article I couldn't seem to get an A.I. to understand what I was asking it to do. After I stumbled on a \"system prompt leaks\" GitHub I got a better sense of how I should talk to an LLM.\n\nI would love a much more extensive/detailed version based on the Wikipedia article but it would be so long and thorough that it would have to be 1) written by a person, not AI, and 2) would be so long that it would have to be for a system prompt of a new LLM, not patching on top of a frontier closed-source model.\n\nI would not be surprised if someone has made something similar already, but I wanted a prompt/instruction *specifically* based on Wikipedia's great article.\n\nAnyway, I hope this will help at least one person not get cringey ChatGPT responses from now on.",
