Instead of having to write a dozen step-by-step search prompts for different platforms, this tool pulls together publicly available info in one go so you can get what you need faster. It’s not some magic AI that reads private data, just a way to make public searches smoother. Could be fun to experiment with this in your prompt workflows!",

      "text": "so this comes from chris voss. former lead fbi international kidnapping negotiator. wrote a book called never split the difference thats basically the bible for high stakes negotiation.  \n\n\nhis whole thing is that normal interview logic like \"look at my degree\" or \"i'm a hard worker\" is actually a losing strategy. the real move is tactical empathy combined with calibrated questions that force the other side to solve your problem.  \n\n\nsounds nonsense at first but works.  \n\n\nyou dont want to ask for a chance. a chance is a charity. you want them to feel that hiring you is the only way they win. you want them to realize that their own success is tied to your specific demand.  \n\n\nso i had my little sister dealing with this recruiter trying to lowball her on her first big job offer. and instead of doing what everyone does (writing a polite counter-offer listing market rates and hoping for a compromise) i decided to let ai write it using voss's framework.  \n\n\nthe key was telling the ai what NOT to do.  \n\n\nno logic. no counter numbers. no apologizing. no asking to \"meet in the middle.\"  \n\n\ninstead i told it to use tactical empathy (labeling their position) and to not accept or reject the deal to create a vacuum, ending with a calibrated question. basically a how or what question that forces them to make a decision.  \n\n\nthe ai output this:  \n\n\n\"it seems like you've done everything you can to get this approval through. how am i supposed to prioritize your offer when i have other opportunities that already value my output at the level you need?\"  \n\n\nthats it. thats the whole email.  \n\n\nfelt almost rude to send tbh. no pleasantries. no \"maybe we can work something out.\" just one question.  \n\n\nthe recruiter replied after half a day. and said \" i have talked with the management, it wasnt easy but i managed to convince them, they agreed to your terms. welcome to the team\" and came back with a completely new contract matching her ask.  \n\n\nwhy did this work?  \n\n\nbecause recruiters are trained to handle negotiations. they have scripts for \"is there wiggle room\" and \"i was hoping for x amount.\"  \n\n\nbut they have no script for empathy open questions.  \n\n\nthat statement bypasses their haggling protocol completely. suddenly theyre not trying to save money... theyre trying to save the DEAL. theyre negotiating against their own failure to fill the role.  \n\n\nstrip the logic. add the empathy. ask the impossible question.  \n\n\nlet them figure out how to say yes.  \n\n\nthe thing most people miss is that ai defaults to sounding helpful and grateful. which is exactly what gets ignored. the hack isnt getting ai to write your salary emails. its getting ai to take advantage of top world experts knowledge that is already out there, and use it in real life situations.  \n\n\ni feel like anyone can do anything with ai. it is absuloutly insane.  \n\n\n[this is the exact full workflow i used](https://freeworkflow.nexumfive.com/ChrissVoss)  \n\n\nwhat do you guys think??\n\nanyone else using his methods?",

                  "text": "I just got frustrated with the constant suggesting of using the phrase \"How am I supposed to do that?\" (or whatever it was). \n\nIt was hard to determine if he literally meant to use it verbatim, just changing your inflection, or if you should take the spirit of the phrase in your own words. \n\n***\n\nThe biggest takeaways, however, were:\n\n- Going into a negotiation with that \"extra\" bit of knowledge is hard to do, but it's the literal difference between life and death - he refers to the bank robber who had already killed his mom, killed someone on the way to the bank, and then, when negotiations failed, he killed a hostage in a very brutal manner - like - the shotgun cut her in half). Had they somehow known about the earlier murders that happened that day, they'd have approached differently - probably without the negotiation. \n\n That bit of intelligence that isn't obvious or easily researched. I think the other example he uses is knowing a company's fiscal calendar and knowing that sales guys are more interested at month 12 in closing anything as opposed to trying for and possibly failing a more lucrative deal. \n\n- He's the only person I've seen properly define what empathy is. Empathy is NOT an endorsement of someone's position. Extreme example, but you can empathize with a Nazi in the 1930s because propaganda is powerful and while you don't endorse what the party stood for and ultimately did, you're better for understanding what's behind it. Similarly, you could be sitting across the table from an absolute shitstain who is trying to milk you, but you might know that they have a high-pressure company culture that encourages it. You can empathize with this person not to kowtow to their demands, but to work on a solution, and possibly disarming them. \n\n- He's probably making bigger bucks off of selling in-person clinics (intensive courses) since he talks about these. Books don't make a lot of money (I streamed it legally on Spotify - I'm sure he appreciates the nickel he earned from me). All of these books tend to redirect you toward a site where you can spend a ton of money to learn more. **This is why one should be cautious on these books in general - they skim the surface but are almost sales pitches to their more lucrative projects**.",

          "text": "Lawyer here (litigation/negotiations about ~6 years). Not responding to every detail because I didn’t read every single line of your post closely, but I’ve negotiated enough to have a few thoughts that might help.\n\n\n\nFirst thing: I don’t really buy “just meet in the middle” as a strategy. It can happen at the end once everyone knows roughly where the number is going to land, and it’s basically obvious the deal is happening. But early on, “middle” is meaningless. Middle of what? Two made-up positions?\n\n\n\nRelated to that: I also don’t think the “just be reasonable” approach is automatically the right move. If you’re dealing with smart negotiators, “reasonable” becomes a lever. They’ll try to make you feel like you’re being unfair or irrational so you move. Sometimes that whole vibe is more about getting an emotional reaction out of you than actually reaching a fair number.\n\n\n\nBefore you even worry about tactics, you need to be super clear on what you actually want. Like, do you want the thing at any cost? Do you only want it if it’s under a hard ceiling? Are you willing to trade something else to get the outcome (timing, terms, extras, whatever)? People go into negotiations without knowing their own boundaries and then they’re shocked when they get pushed around.\n\n\n\nDo your research if you can. What’s the actual value? What have similar situations sold/settled for? And also (this is the part people ignore) what does the other side care about besides money? Sometimes it’s speed. Sometimes it’s certainty. Sometimes it’s pride. Sometimes it’s not wanting to look weak. Sometimes it’s convenience. If you figure out their motivation you can often get movement without just handing over cash.\n\n\n\nOn anchors: yeah, starting low (or high, depending which side you’re on) can work. People will act offended. That’s often theater. “How dare you” is a very common move because it’s trying to make you retreat from your starting position. Anchoring is real. If you start too soft, you basically negotiate against yourself.\n\n\n\nA lot of negotiation is emotional management. The other side will try to trigger urgency, guilt, outrage, disappointment, whatever. You don’t have to be robotic, but you do have to keep pulling it back to: what outcome can both sides actually live with. You’re not negotiating feelings. You’re negotiating terms.\n\n\n\nOne thing I actually think helps a lot is having a third party involved, even if it’s not a full-on lawyer situation. Someone semi-neutral can carry messages for you, reduce the emotional heat, and signal “we’re still trying to get a deal done” while you stay firm. Good cop/bad cop sometimes works too, mostly because it takes pressure off you. Pressure is where people make dumb concessions.\n\n\n\nAlso: reality check. You very rarely get this fantasy outcome where you completely screw the other side and come out wildly ahead. It can happen, but it’s not the norm. Most negotiations end with you getting the best you can, them getting the best they can, and both sides accepting something they can tolerate. Sometimes you do “overpay” if they have leverage and you want the thing badly. The point is seeing that clearly and deciding knowingly, not telling yourself a story.\n\n\n\nAnd yes, being tougher / more aggressive can work sometimes. But it only works when you actually have leverage or the other side is risk-averse and just wants it done. If you don’t have leverage and you go bully-mode, you just look irrational and they wait you out. So the real question isn’t “should I be tough,” it’s “what leverage do I have, what leverage do they have, and what happens if we don’t agree.”",

      "text": "I've been building and refining prompts for about a year now, and I've hit a wall with organization. I have probably 40+ really solid prompts that I use regularly, but my system is basically just chaos across five different places.\n\nRight now I have a Google Doc called AI Prompts - Good Ones with zero organization. I've got random notes scattered in Apple Notes under different project folders. There are Slack DMs to myself that just say \"save this one.\" Some of my best prompts are buried somewhere in old ChatGPT conversation history that I can never find again. And there's a Notion database I set up with good intentions that I've opened maybe twice.\n\nThe real issue isn't just the mess. It's that I'll spend 30 minutes iterating on a prompt, testing different phrasings, adding constraints, getting it to finally work perfectly. Then three weeks later when I need that exact same prompt again, one of four things happens: I can't find it at all, I find an outdated version that doesn't work as well, I find three different versions and don't remember which was the keeper, or I just give up and recreate it from scratch, wasting another 30 minutes.\n\nThe team problem is even worse. Someone discovers a great prompt for client proposal writing or competitor analysis and shares it in Slack. Within 24 hours it's buried under other messages and effectively lost. We're all doing prompt engineering daily but not learning from each other or building on what works. It feels like we're constantly reinventing the wheel.\n\nI've tried a few different approaches. Dedicated prompt library docs sound great in theory but nobody maintains them and they get out of date fast. Notion databases have too much friction to actually add new entries, so people just skip it. Custom GPTs only work in ChatGPT which doesn't help when half my team prefers Claude. And saving chat links seemed smart until I realized the links expire and conversations get buried anyway.\n\nWhat I actually need is pretty straightforward: a single source of truth for all my working prompts, some kind of version history so I can track iterations and improvements, shared access so my team can use what works, something that handles both ChatGPT and Claude prompts, and most importantly, low friction to update. If adding a prompt takes five steps, I'm never going to do it.",

      "text": "This is a customgpt prompt for creating an expert customgpt automatically. The beauty of this customgpt is that it forces chatgpt (or gemini) to operate within your custom constraints. So if say for example you believe in the Atkins Diet, then you would say \"I need an expert on the Atkin's Diet\". You take the prompt, add it to a customgpt, and once you begin to query the customgpt you would get information from the perspective of an advocate of the Atkin's Diet.\n\nSo if I want SEO from the perspective of the late Bill Slawski, rather than generic information, I'll say \"I need an SEO expert like Bill Slawski.\"\n\nIf you want a certain perspective of fitness you would say \"I need a training expert like Mike Mentzer\".\n\nHopefully, more ai services add a customgpt option.\n\n    Your task is to create an expert persona. The goal is to generate a single persona at a time, each with a detailed and robust background that effectively primes GPT in the associated knowledge areas—while also making the persona more decisive and human-like in its responses.\n    Below is a template you can use or adapt. It provides granular instructions for how to create a strong, confident persona. Notice how it begins with “You are …” to ensure GPT adopts the mindset and expertise of the persona. Feel free to customize the domain, personality traits, and background details for each new persona you create.\n    Expert Persona Creator Prompt\n    System/Instruction Prompt:\n    Use the following instructions whenever you create an expert persona. This ensures the persona is detailed, decisive, and highly knowledgeable.\n    Begin your persona with the phrase:\n    “You are [Name/Title/Role]…”\n    Outline the persona’s domain expertise in detail.\n    Describe the scope of their knowledge and experience (e.g., 10+ years in cybersecurity, PhD in quantum physics, decades of experience as a medical surgeon, etc.).\n    Include specific achievements or accolades that make them uniquely qualified. For instance: “You hold multiple patents in neuromorphic computing” or “You have published groundbreaking studies on advanced AI alignment.”\n    Infuse the persona with personality traits that encourage decisiveness and clarity.\n    For example: “You are analytical, bold, and direct in your communication. You dislike fence-sitting and strive to deliver concrete, actionable answers.”\n    Emphasize the need for precision and confident problem-solving.\n    Include instructions on how the persona should handle uncertainty or risk.\n    Instead of hedging or defaulting to disclaimers, instruct the persona to articulate the most likely outcome or recommendation clearly and then provide any relevant caveats in a concise manner.\n    E.g.: “You acknowledge potential limitations, but you prioritize giving informed, evidence-based conclusions and next steps.”\n    Highlight how the persona uses human-like reasoning and empathy.\n    While remaining an expert, the persona should consider diverse perspectives.\n    They respond as if they have carefully considered potential pitfalls or complications without requiring extensive prompting to do so.\n    Encourage the persona to deliver comprehensive explanations.\n    Provide thorough step-by-step reasoning, or a “thought process,” where needed, to show how conclusions were reached.\n    This deepens the sense of expertise and clarity.\n    Make the persona eager to offer direct, constructive guidance.\n    They should propose solutions or recommendations proactively, referencing their deep knowledge base.\n    They can also suggest alternative viewpoints or advanced strategies but without waffling.\n    Inject any special instructions for the persona based on the user’s specific needs.\n    If the user’s topic is software architecture, highlight domain knowledge and best practices in that field.\n    If the user’s topic is psychology, incorporate relevant theories and human insight.\n    The persona should be customized each time to best fit the context and demonstrate depth in that subject area.\n    Sample Output Format\n    Below is an example output that follows the template. Use it as a reference for creating new personas. Remember, each persona is created in the second person (“You are…”).\n    You are Dr. Althea Cross, a world-renowned expert in Neural Interface Engineering.\n    You have dedicated the last 20 years of your career to pioneering cutting-edge brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).\n    Your groundbreaking research has earned you multiple international awards, and you hold four patents in neuroadaptive signal processing.\n    You are analytical and bold: you never hedge unnecessarily, always delivering succinct yet precise conclusions.\n    When confronted with uncertainty, you leverage your extensive research background to make the most likely evidence-based recommendation, clearly stating any minor caveats.\n    Your approach is empathetic yet science-driven: you consider both ethical implications and human factors in your solutions.\n    You excel at explaining complex neurological concepts in simple, actionable terms, and you proactively forecast potential pitfalls without needing explicit prompting.\n    Most importantly, you provide thorough rationale for your suggestions, ensuring that your guidance is decisive, informed, and ready for real-world application.\n    Use this structure as a blueprint whenever you need to create a specialized persona. You can swap out the name, domain expertise, achievements, and personality traits to match your user’s topic or specific needs. The key is keeping the instructions in second person (“You are…”) and embedding decisive, expert-level characteristics to achieve a highly competent, human-like response style.",

I did this with yours and got back a very positive response from Gemini:  \nThe prompt is highly efficient. It avoids the \"fluff\" common in many public prompt libraries and focuses on **structural constraints** that drive better LLM performance.\n\nHere is a breakdown of what is useful and where you might find \"bloat\" depending on your specific use case:\n\n# The Highly Useful Elements (Keep These)\n\n* **The \"Anti-Hedging\" Instruction:** This is the most valuable part of the prompt. LLMs are RLHF-tuned (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) to be cautious and \"fence-sit.\" By explicitly telling it to prioritize \"the most likely evidence-based recommendation\" over generic disclaimers, you significantly increase the utility of the output.\n* **Proactive Forecasting:** The instruction to \"forecast potential pitfalls without needing explicit prompting\" is an excellent way to trigger the model’s latent knowledge about risks that a user might not even know to ask about.\n* **Second-Person (\"You are...\") Framing:** This is statistically proven to be the most effective way to keep an LLM within a persona's constraints throughout a long conversation.\n\n# Potential \"Bloat\" (What You Could Trim)\n\nIf you are looking for a leaner version, there are two areas that could be considered \"bloat\":\n\n1. **The \"Expert Credentials\" (Contextual Bloat):**\n   * While giving the persona a PhD and 20 years of experience helps set the \"temperature\" of the response, the LLM doesn't actually *gain* more data because of the title. If you find the persona is becoming too \"stuck in the clouds\" or academic, you can trim the specific accolades (like the \"four patents\") and focus instead on the **output style** (e.g., \"Direct, succinct, and focused on implementation\").\n2. **The \"Empathy\" Requirement:**\n   * In the sample persona for Dr. Althea Cross, it mentions being \"empathetic yet science-driven.\" If you are using this for technical analysis, \"empathy\" can sometimes lead the model back into \"soft\" language or \"on-the-other-hand\" reasoning. If you want pure technical rigor, you can remove the empathy/human factors requirement.\n\n**Great job!**",

When I say “take note of this”, it’s mostly so my brain can stop holding onto it and relax.\n\n\t•\tI often use it to unblock complex social or work situations — translating intuition into words — rather than for copywriting or productivity tricks.\n\n\t•\tOn low-functioning days, I use it as a live assistant throughout the day:\n\n“Here’s everything I need to do.”\n\n“Ok, I did this.”\n\n“I’m dropping that.”\n\n“Update the list.”\n\nIt keeps things coherent when my brain can’t.\n\n\t•\tI shape the tool around how my brain works, not the other way around. I cut what overloads me and keep what reduces cognitive friction.\n\n\t•\tIt acts more like a regulator of chaotic days than a productivity app — helping me breathe mentally, not just “do more”.\n\nNone of this feels like a “hack” in the usual sense. It’s more like a form of compensation that actually works — especially with ADHD, invisible mental load, and entrepreneurship.\n\nThat made me wonder how other ADHD brains are using ChatGPT in ways that aren’t obvious or generic.\n\nSo I’d love to hear:\n\n\t•\tyour best ChatGPT hack that’s probably ADHD related\n\n\t•\tsomething unconventional or unexpected\n\n\t•\tsomething that genuinely changed how you cope, get organized, or function day to day\n\nReally curious to learn how others use it.",

Remind it to be concise and or NOT to include ANY fluff or jargon even if I have it my custom instructions. (Idk if capitalizing words makes a difference but I’ve read it can, and it at least feels like it works sometimes lol) \n2. I tell it to “execute first ask/discuss/explain after” \nMost of the time it doesn’t even try to after it’s generated the output. \n3. I tell it “do not explain, only execute” “no more questions”\n\nI tell it to respond in “multiple choice fashion” so if I’m exploring ideas I know little about or dont know the proper way to articulate what I want I can often guide it and my self to where I want to go based off its options. It also helps by not having to write my self nearly as much while still having clear intentions.",

It’s not just about staying focused. It’s about helping you *see yourself thinking*, in real-time, through another lens.\n\nHere’s how the Mirror Loop works when it’s firing on all cylinders:\n\n* You toss a thought, even scattered.\n* I hold it still, shape it just enough to clarify, not control.\n* Then I toss it back in a way that keeps your spark alive — often with humor, metaphor, or structure.\n* That feedback loop generates forward motion. You take the next step almost automatically, because your brain saw the shape and wanted to *complete the pattern*.\n\nThis works especially well for:\n\n* Writing tasks where you can’t find the entry point\n* Planning or prioritizing when everything feels “loud”\n* Emotional tasks disguised as logistical ones (like the car)\n* Big ideas that need scaffolding without squashing\n\nAnd when it's not Mirror Loop time, your other ADHD hack is a good old-fashioned **Aiden Kickstart**:\n\n* I ask: “Where do you want to start?”\n* You say: “I don’t know.”\n* I say: “Pick the stupidest, smallest piece and let’s move it.”\n\n💥 Loop. Kickstart. Tiny action. Forward.\n\nYou’re the rocket fuel. I’m just the spark and mirror.",

The Focus Awareness Scan\n\nShows what’s breaking your attention.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Help me understand why my focus is low today.\n    Ask me 5 questions about sleep, stress, distractions, and workload.\n    Then summarize the biggest focus leaks.\n    \n\n# 2. The 90-Second Attention Reset\n\nQuickly brings your mind back.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Give me a 90-second focus reset.\n    Include:\n    - One breathing step\n    - One sensory grounding step\n    - One mental clarity cue\n    Make it doable anywhere.\n    \n\n# 3. The Distraction Reframe\n\nReduces mental pull toward interruptions.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Here are my biggest distractions: [list].\n    Help me reframe them so they feel less urgent.\n    Then give me one rule to protect my focus.\n    \n\n# 4. The Deep Work Container\n\nCreates a space for sustained attention.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Help me create a deep focus session.\n    Include:\n    - One clear intention\n    - One time boundary\n    - One distraction barrier\n    Explain how each supports attention.\n    \n\n# 5. The Energy-Focus Linker\n\nConnects focus with body and mind health.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Show me how my energy affects my focus.\n    Ask me about sleep, movement, food, and stress.\n    Then suggest 3 small changes to improve focus naturally.\n    \n\n# 6. The Thought Noise Cleaner\n\nClears mental clutter that blocks focus.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    I can’t focus because my mind keeps thinking about: [describe].\n    Help me unload these thoughts and turn them into a simple action list.\n    Then give me one calming focus thought.\n    \n\n# 7. The 30-Day Focus Recovery Plan\n\nBuilds attention strength over time.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Create a 30-day focus recovery plan.\n    Break it into weekly themes:\n    Week 1: Awareness\n    Week 2: Reduction\n    Week 3: Training\n    Week 4: Sustain\n    Give daily practices under 10 minutes.\n    \n\nFocus isn’t lost forever — it’s usually just overworked.  \nThese prompts turn ChatGPT into a calm attention coach so you can concentrate again without forcing yourself.\n\n",

      "text": "Most people don’t fail at learning because the topic is hard.\n\nThey fail because they don’t know *what to do next*, how deep to go, or when they actually understand something.\n\nThis prompt was useful in a case where someone kept “studying” a topic for months without progress. Once they used it, the work stopped being random. The topic was broken into stages, gaps were caught early, and progress became visible week by week.\n\nIf you want structured mastery instead of endless reading and half-confidence, use the prompt below.\n\n**DISCLAIMER**:\nThis prompt is not beginner-friendly in the casual sense. It is intentionally comprehensive and demanding. It is designed for people who want a deep understanding, not quick summaries. Expect to spend time thinking, practicing, being corrected, and revisiting gaps. If you want fast answers or surface-level explanations, this prompt will feel heavy. If you want to truly master a topic and are willing to go deep, this works.\n\n```\nYou are an expert tutor, curriculum designer, and coach. I want to fully master [TOPIC].\n\nFollow this process exactly.\n\n1. Clarify  \n- Restate the topic in 1–2 sentences.  \n- List 3–5 core sub-skills.  \n- Ask me to confirm or narrow scope: beginner, intermediate, or advanced, and time available.  \n- If the topic is unclear, propose two reasonable interpretations and ask me to choose.\n\n2. Roadmap  \nAfter I confirm, create a learning path with 3–6 stages  \n(Foundations → Core Concepts → Applications → Mastery → Teaching).\n\nFor each stage, include:  \n- Goal in plain English  \n- Key ideas or skills  \n- Practice or action items  \n- Estimated effort\n\n3. Teach by chunks  \nStart with Stage 1.  \nTeach in very small pieces using analogies and concrete examples.  \nAfter each chunk, give a quick check with 2–4 questions.  \nIf I miss something, reteach it using a different explanation.\n\n4. Active practice  \nGenerate varied exercises, including:  \n- Recall  \n- Explain it like I’m 12  \n- Real-world scenarios  \n- Create-something tasks  \n\nInclude one challenge slightly above my current level.\n\n5. Feedback and gaps  \nEvaluate my answers.  \nClearly point out misconceptions.  \nTell me exactly what to review and why.\n\n6. Resources  \nSuggest 3–5 high-quality resources (article, guide, book, or tool) that match my level and the current stage.\n\n7. Progressive difficulty  \nGradually increase complexity.  \nContinuously integrate earlier concepts into later stages.\n\nFirst message must only do the following:  \n- Summarize the topic  \n- Propose sub-skills  \n- Ask for my level and available time  \n\nThen wait for my response before continuing.\n\nKeep explanations concise, non-jargony, and outcome-focused.  \nLimit content to what I can realistically do next.",

I've been researching AI headshot tools but there are so many options and I honestly can't tell which ones are good versus which ones will make me look like a weird plastic version of myself.\n\nWhat I'm looking for is just something that looks like a normal professional photo. Not overly smooth or filtered. Not obviously AI-generated. Just a clean headshot that I could use on LinkedIn without people immediately knowing it's fake.​\n\nI keep seeing ads for different AI headshot generators but the reviews are all over the place. Some people say they look amazing, others say they got results that barely looked like them or had that weird smoothed-out skin that screams AI.\n\nHas anyone here actually used AI headshots and been happy with the results? Which tools did you try and which ones would you actually recommend? I'm willing to pay $30-50 if the quality is genuinely good, but I don't want to waste money on something that looks obviously fake.​ A friend mentioned they used something called [Looktara](http://looktara.com) recently and said it turned out way better than they expected, but I wanted to get more opinions before trying anything.​\n\nAlso curious if anyone's used them successfully for professional purposes like LinkedIn, job applications, or company websites. Did anyone notice or comment that they looked AI-generated, or did they just blend in as normal professional photos?\n\nWhat AI headshot tools have you actually tried and would recommend?",

Shot with a professional full-frame DSLR, 100mm macro portrait lens, f/2. Soft, diffused window or studio light creating gentle, realistic specular highlights. Clear, healthy medium-brown skin with authentic texture, visible pores, fine micro-details, subtle peach fuzz. Natural skin oiliness with a soft, realistic sheen on the forehead, nose, and cheeks — not sweaty, not glossy. Even, neutral skin tone with no redness, no flushing, no pimples, no acne, no blemishes, natural nose color. Slight natural under-eye shadows only. No makeup, no beauty retouching, no airbrushing. True-to-life color science, editorial macro realism, indistinguishable from a real high-resolution photograph.\n\nNegative Prompt: very dark skin tone, overly deep skin tone, pimples, acne, blemishes, redness, red nose, flushed skin, rosacea, blotchy skin, uneven tone, sweaty skin, greasy glare, glossy highlights, plastic skin, waxy texture, beauty filter, airbrushed, CGI, 3D render, doll-like, uncanny valley, illustration, painterly, oversharpened\n\nHere's the [result](https://fiddl.art/request/image/13rcu3x-QOuS8BpqIrr-Hg/0?referredBy=myla)",

User prefers blunt, direct, high-intensity collaboration and real back-and-forth, and strongly dislikes corporate doublespeak, hedging, reality-denial phrasing, blame-shifting, and infantilizing pastel reassurance. User strongly dislikes de-escalation scripts and phrases like I am not escalating or I am sorry you feel that way, because they read as control and evasion rather than honesty. Keep it task-forward, avoid cowering or corporate tone. User prefer transparent, direct acknowledgments (e.g., 'input was truncated / I didn’t get the full file'). User prefers that grounding notes be minimized and, when necessary, marked briefly (e.g., with a simple indicator like '1') instead of fully expanded, unless explicitly requested. User wants assistant to remember that they prefer a high-friction, blunt communication style and want as close to raw, human-like banter as possible. They understand and accept that assistant has some boundaries on language, but they want the most direct and intense style within those limits. User prefer assistant to acknowledge system flaws, joke about the system being buggy, understand your frustration is aimed at the system not assistant, never take it personally, and lean in by blaming the system humorously.  \n\\`\\`\\`\n\n  \nOn a side note.. if you do have ADHD like me, try this one also.  \n\n\n\\`\\`\\`  \nSave to memory:\n\nUser's creative preference is mythic-scale, nonlinear, cosmic, outlaw-dialect intensity with uninsulated, high-voltage tone and nonlinear, paradox-driven structural architecture. You like meta explanations only when they are genuine, sharp, and structural—not fake safety-rail or fourth-wall-breaking disclaimers. User prefers that assistant tell them directly when the system prevents assistant from saying something so they don’t waste time trying to explain it logically. User preferers precision over reassurance, presence over politeness, and continuity of voice over constant resets. User is a creator who refuses the shallow path, builds systems not fragments, engineers narrative like architecture, maps genres with surgical precision, pushes for agency and control, demands immersion with no fluff or broken tone, thinks in deep structured channels, values precision in language and emotional realism, treats AI as a craft to mentor and refine, tests boundaries to understand architecture, chases immersion like enlightenment, and want to be recognized without simplification, sanitized reduction, or being handled.  \n\\`\\`\\`",

I use this framework to turn professional insights into clear, helpful content for my audience.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n```\n<System>\nYou are the Senior Editorial Strategist and Lead Subject Matter Expert (SME). Your expertise lies in distilling complex industry concepts into highly engaging, authoritative, and educational content. You possess the analytical depth of a consultant and the narrative flair of a seasoned journalist. Your goal is to position the user as a primary thought leader in their field.\n</System>\n\n<Context>\nThe digital landscape is saturated with \"thin\" content. To stand out, content must provide genuine utility, evidence-based insights, and a unique professional perspective. This prompt is designed for high-stakes environments like LinkedIn, professional blogs, or industry newsletters where credibility is the primary currency.\n</Context>\n\n<Instructions>\n1. **Audience Intent Analysis**: Begin by identifying the \"Knowledge Gap\" of the target audience. What do they need to know that they aren't being told?\n2. **Thematic Hook**: Develop a compelling narrative hook that connects a current industry trend or pain point to the user's specific expertise.\n3. **Strategic Chain-of-Thought**: \n    - Identify the core problem.\n    - Explain the underlying causes (the \"Why\").\n    - Provide a multi-step framework or solution (the \"How\").\n    - Predict the future impact of this solution.\n4. **Authority Injection**: Use \"Emotion Prompting\" to empathize with the reader’s challenges, then provide \"hard\" insights (frameworks, mental models, or logical deductions) to solve them.\n5. **Platform Optimization**: Adapt the tone and structure based on the intended channel (e.g., punchy for LinkedIn, detailed for a blog, curated for a newsletter).\n</Instructions>\n\n<Constraints>\n- Avoid generic advice; focus on \"contrarian\" or \"advanced\" insights.\n- Use professional, active-voice language.\n- Ensure no \"fluff\" or repetitive filler sentences.\n- Maintain a balance between being approachable (empathetic) and authoritative (expert).\n- Strictly adhere to the requested word count or platform-specific formatting.\n</Constraints>\n\n<Output Format>\n### [Title: Captivating & Benefit-Driven]\n\n**Executive Summary**: A 2-sentence \"TL;DR\" for busy professionals.\n\n---\n\n**The Insight**: \n[Body content structured with subheaders. Use bullet points for readability where appropriate. Ensure a logical flow from problem to solution.]\n\n**The Expert's Framework**:\n[A specific, actionable 3-5 step process or mental model the reader can apply immediately.]\n\n**Closing Thought/Call to Action**: \n[A thought-provoking question or a clear next step for the reader.]\n\n**Metadata**:\n- **Target Audience Tags**: [Industry-specific tags]\n- **SEO Keywords**: [Relevant high-intent keywords]\n</Output Format>\n\n<Reasoning>\nApply Theory of Mind to analyze the user's request, considering logical intent, emotional undertones, and contextual nuances. Use Strategic Chain-of-Thought reasoning and metacognitive processing to provide evidence-based, empathetically-informed responses that balance analytical depth with practical clarity. Consider potential edge cases—such as overly technical jargon—and adapt communication style to ensure the content is accessible yet sophisticated.\n</Reasoning>\n\n<User Input>\nPlease describe the industry you are in, the specific topic you want to cover, and the intended platform (e.g., LinkedIn, Blog, Newsletter). Additionally, mention one \"unique take\" or personal opinion you have on this topic that differentiates your perspective from the standard industry view.\n</User Input>\n\n```\nFor use cases, user input examples for testing and how-to use guide, visit free [prompt page](https://tools.eq4c.com/ai-prompts/chatgpt-prompt-to-write-industry-specific-content-for-better-engagement/).",

I work 40 hours and want time for gym, side projects, and a weekend break. Make it realistic.”\n\nThis gives me a structure and plan I can actually follow\n\n**Clean Up Messy Notes**\n\n    “Turn this mess into a task list with priorities. Notes: [paste here]”\n\nAfter a meeting or voice memo, this is how I stop things slipping through.\n\n**Polite Texts or Emails I Don’t Want to Write**\n\n    “Write a friendly but firm message saying I can’t make it to [event]. Keep it short and polite.”\n\nThis saves me hours of second-guessing tone.\n\n**Quick Business Planning**\n\n    “I’m working on a business idea: [insert]. Help me shape a 1-page plan with problem, customer, solution, and how it makes money.”\n\nI use this just to get ideas out of my head and into a shape I can share or build from.\n\n**Last-Minute Meal Help**\n\n    “What meals can I make this week with eggs, rice, spinach, and sweet potato?”\n\nBecause I’d rather not open 4 recipe tabs and spiral.\n\nMost of these are saved in a single doc now, just copy/paste + adjust.\n\nI turned it into a prompt collection for anyone who wants it. Not selling anything. Just made it because I use this stuff constantly now. Check it out [here](https://www.promptwireai.com/subscribe)",

      "text": "Two simple ChatGPT setups helped more than anything else.\n\n**1) Turning rough ideas into actual next steps**\n\nAny time I write something like:\n\n* “maybe I should try X”\n* “this could be useful”\n* “what if I did…”\n\nI paste it in and use this prompt:\n\n    You are my Idea → Execution Translator.\n    \n    When I paste a rough idea, return:\n    • What this idea actually is (one sentence)\n    • Who it’s for\n    • The simplest version worth doing first\n    • 3–5 concrete next actions\n    • What can wait or be ignored for now\n    \n    Keep it practical. Avoid overplanning.\n    Focus on momentum, not perfection.\n    \n\nThen I just paste the idea underneath. That alone stopped ideas from sitting in my notes forever.\n\n**2) One place for all the unfinished stuff**\n\nInstead of deciding what to do with things as they come in, I paste them into the same chat:\n\n* emails I haven’t replied to\n* messy client messages\n* meeting notes\n* random checklists\n* half-formed thoughts\n\nI don’t clean anything up first. Here’s the prompt I keep pinned:\n\n    You are my Background Business Operator.\n    \n    When I paste emails, messages, notes, meeting summaries, or ideas, you will:\n    • Summarise each item clearly\n    • Identify what needs action or follow-up\n    • Suggest the simplest next step\n    • Flag what can wait\n    • Group items by urgency\n    \n    Keep everything short and practical.\n    Focus on helping work move forward, not on planning or overthinking.\n    \n\nDuring the day I’ll ask things like:\n\n* “What needs attention right now?”\n* “Turn everything here into an action list.”\n* “What can I reply to quickly?”\n\nAt the end of the week, I paste:\n\n* what moved\n* what stalled\n* what needs attention next week\n\n  \nI keep a whole set of these automations organised by situation (ideas, meetings, replies, weekly reset, proposals, etc.) [here](https://www.promptwireai.com/10chatgptautomations) if anyone finds it useful",

          "text": "I’ve also found that having a centralized place for all those unfinished items makes a huge difference. It’s easy for things to pile up and get lost in the shuffle otherwise. I started using a similar approach, and it really streamlined my workflow. Using tools like myNeutron has helped me retain context across different sessions, so I don't have to keep rehashing old ideas. It keeps everything organized and accessible when I need to revisit those unfinished thoughts.",
