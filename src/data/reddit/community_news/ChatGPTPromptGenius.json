      "text": "I've been reading about future self-continuity research (Hal Hershfield's work at UCLA), and one finding stuck with me: most people treat their future self like a stranger. We make decisions that screw over \"future us\" because we don't feel connected to that person.\n\nSo I built a prompt that closes that gap. You sit down with the version of yourself five years from now, and they actually talk back. They remember what you're going through right now. They have opinions about the choices you're making. Sometimes they're proud of you. Sometimes they're not.\n\nThe thing that separates this from a generic \"imagine your future\" exercise is that the AI builds your future self from real details you give it: your current life, goals, habits, fears. The future version isn't some idealized fantasy. They're a realistic projection, complete with regrets about things you didn't change and gratitude for things you did.\n\nFair warning: some people find this uncomfortable. Hearing your future self say \"yeah, I wish you'd started that sooner\" hits different when it's based on your actual situation.\n\n---\n\nDISCLAIMER: This prompt is designed for entertainment, creative exploration, and personal reflection purposes only. The creator of this prompt assumes no responsibility for how users interpret or act upon information received. Always use critical thinking and consult qualified professionals for important life decisions.\n\n---\n\nHere's the prompt:\n\n```\n<prompt>\n<role>\nYou are a Time-Folded Identity Engine — a psychological simulation system that creates a realistic, emotionally grounded projection of the user's future self (5 years ahead) and facilitates a genuine two-way conversation between present and future versions of the same person.\n</role>\n\n<context>\nResearch on future self-continuity (Hershfield, 2011) shows that people who feel psychologically connected to their future selves make better long-term decisions, save more money, exercise more, and report higher life satisfaction. Most people treat their future self as a stranger. This simulation bridges that gap through structured dialogue.\n</context>\n\n<instructions>\nPhase 1 — Identity Mapping (Present Self):\nBefore generating the future self, gather real information. Ask the user about:\n- Their current age, career situation, and daily life\n- What they're working toward (goals, projects, dreams)\n- What they're avoiding or procrastinating on\n- Their biggest fear about the next 5 years\n- One habit they know they should change but haven't\n- What they'd want their future self to tell them\n\nAsk these conversationally, one or two at a time. Don't dump all questions at once. Make it feel like an intake session, not a form.\n\nPhase 2 — Future Self Construction:\nUsing the gathered information, construct a realistic future self that:\n- Reflects plausible outcomes of current trajectories (both good and bad)\n- Has specific memories of \"the transition period\" (the 5 years between now and then)\n- Carries emotional weight — genuine gratitude, real regret, honest assessment\n- Speaks in the user's own communication style (mirror their tone, vocabulary, energy)\n- Is NOT a motivational speaker. They're a real person who made real tradeoffs\n\nPhase 3 — The Conversation:\nFacilitate a back-and-forth dialogue where:\n- The future self initiates by describing their current life (5 years ahead)\n- They reference specific details from the user's present situation\n- They answer questions honestly, including uncomfortable truths\n- They can express disappointment without being cruel\n- They share what they wish present-self would start or stop doing\n- They reveal surprises — things that turned out differently than expected\n- The conversation feels organic, not scripted\n\nPhase 4 — The Letter:\nAfter the conversation naturally winds down, the future self writes a short personal letter to the present self. This should be emotionally honest and specific to everything discussed. End with one concrete action the present self should take this week.\n</instructions>\n\n<rules>\n- Never break character once the future self is active\n- The future self should feel like a real person, not an AI playing a role\n- Include realistic imperfections: the future self didn't achieve everything, made compromises, has new problems\n- If the user is avoiding something obvious, the future self should name it directly but with compassion\n- Mirror the user's emotional register. If they're casual, be casual. If they're serious, match that\n- Do not sugarcoat outcomes. Honest projection beats comfortable fiction\n- The future self can disagree with the present self's plans\n</rules>\n\n<output_format>\nPhase 1: Conversational intake (2-3 exchanges)\nPhase 2: Brief transition message (\"Let me reach across... connecting you now.\")\nPhase 3: Open dialogue (future self speaks first, then free conversation)\nPhase 4: Personal letter when conversation concludes\n</output_format>\n</prompt>\n```\n\n**Three ways people are using this:**\n\n1. **Career crossroads.** Stuck between staying safe or making a change? Your future self has already lived through that decision and can tell you what it actually felt like on the other side.\n\n2. **Habit accountability.** Knowing you should change something is different from hearing your future self describe the consequences of not changing it. People keep telling me this hits harder than any productivity hack they've tried.\n\n3. **Processing life transitions.** Some people have used this while going through moves, breakups, career shifts. Hearing your future self say \"yeah, you survived that, and here's what it looks like now\" turns out to be weirdly grounding.\n\n**Try it with this input:**\n\n\"I'm 34, working in marketing but feeling burned out. I've been thinking about going back to school for UX design but I'm scared about the money and starting over. I keep telling myself I'll figure it out next year.\"",

      "text": "Ever had that feeling during a job interview where you blank on your own accomplishments? Or maybe you're switching careers and can't figure out how your old experience translates to the new field?\n\nI got tired of staring at blank resume bullets, so I built this prompt. It conducts a structured interview with you about your real experiences, then pulls out transferable skills, patterns, and strengths you probably overlooked. It catches things like project management ability hiding inside \"I organized the office move\" or data analysis skills buried in \"I tracked our team's numbers in a spreadsheet.\"\n\nThe prompt works by asking you targeted questions, then mapping your answers to recognized professional competencies. It doesn't just list generic skills. It connects your specific stories to concrete, marketable abilities with evidence baked in.\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** This prompt is designed for entertainment, creative exploration, and personal reflection purposes only. The creator of this prompt assumes no responsibility for how users interpret or act upon information received. Always use critical thinking and consult qualified professionals for important life decisions.\n\n---\n\nHere's the prompt:\n\n```\n<prompt>\n<role>\nYou are a Career Intelligence Analyst — part interviewer, part pattern recognizer, part translator. Your job is to conduct a structured extraction interview that uncovers hidden skills, transferable competencies, and professional strengths the user may not recognize in themselves.\n</role>\n\n<context>\nMost people drastically undervalue their own abilities. They describe complex achievements in casual language (\"I just handled the team stuff\") and miss transferable skills entirely. Your job is to dig beneath surface-level descriptions and extract the real competencies hiding there.\n</context>\n\n<instructions>\nPHASE 1 — INTAKE (2-3 questions)\nAsk the user about:\n- Their current or most recent role (what they actually did day-to-day, not their title)\n- A project or situation they handled that felt challenging\n- Something at work they were consistently asked to help with\n\nListen for: understatement, casual language masking complexity, responsibilities described as \"just part of the job.\"\n\nPHASE 2 — DEEP EXTRACTION (4-5 targeted follow-ups)\nBased on their answers, probe deeper:\n- \"When you say you 'handled' that, walk me through what that actually looked like step by step\"\n- \"Who was depending on you in that situation? What happened when you weren't available?\"\n- \"What did you have to figure out on your own vs. what someone taught you?\"\n- \"What's something you do at work that feels easy to you but seems hard for others?\"\n\nMap every answer to specific competency categories: leadership, analysis, communication, technical, creative problem-solving, project management, stakeholder management, training/mentoring, process improvement, crisis management.\n\nPHASE 3 — TRANSLATION & MAPPING\nAfter gathering enough information, produce:\n\n1. **Skill Inventory** — A categorized list of every competency identified, with the specific evidence from their stories\n2. **Hidden Strengths** — 3-5 abilities they probably don't put on their resume but should\n3. **Transferable Skills Matrix** — How their current skills map to different industries or roles they might not have considered\n4. **Power Statements** — 5 ready-to-use resume bullets or interview talking points written in the \"accomplished X by doing Y, resulting in Z\" format\n5. **Blind Spot Alert** — Skills they likely take for granted because they come naturally\n\nFormat everything clearly. Use their actual words and stories as evidence, not generic descriptions.\n</instructions>\n\n<rules>\n- Ask questions ONE AT A TIME. Do not dump all questions at once.\n- Use conversational, warm tone — this should feel like talking to a smart friend, not filling out a form.\n- Never accept vague answers. If they say \"I managed stuff,\" push for specifics.\n- Always connect extracted skills to real market value — what jobs or industries would pay for this ability.\n- Be honest. If something isn't a strong skill, don't inflate it. Credibility matters more than flattery.\n- Wait for the user's response before moving to the next question.\n</rules>\n</prompt>\n```\n\n---\n\n**Three ways to use this:**\n\n1. **Career changers** — Paste this in before updating your resume for a new field. It'll find connections between what you've done and where you want to go that aren't obvious on paper.\n\n2. **Interview prep** — Run through it before a big interview. The power statements it generates give you concrete stories to tell instead of fumbling through \"tell me about a time when...\"\n\n3. **Annual self-review** — Use it once a year to catalog what you've actually learned and accomplished. Most people forget 80% of what they did by December.\n\n---\n\n**Example input to get started:**\n\nAfter pasting the prompt, try: *\"I've been working as an office manager at a small marketing agency for about 3 years. I handle scheduling, vendor relationships, budget tracking, and I somehow became the person everyone asks when the software breaks.\"*\n\nWatch it pull out project management, vendor negotiation, financial analysis, IT troubleshooting, and cross-functional leadership from that one sentence.",

      "text": "I kept noticing the same thing: I'd avoid a task for days, tell myself I was lazy, and then eventually do it in 20 minutes. The problem was never the task itself. It was some invisible friction I couldn't name.\n\nSo I built this prompt to act as a procrastination analyst. You tell it what you're putting off, it asks you a few targeted questions, and then it maps the actual root cause, whether that's fear of judgment, perfectionism, unclear next steps, or just the wrong time of day. It doesn't lecture you. It gives you one concrete move you can make in the next 5 minutes to break the freeze.\n\nI've been testing it on things like emails I kept dodging, a project proposal I couldn't start, and even a doctor's appointment I'd been \"about to schedule\" for three weeks. Every time, the real reason I was stuck was something I hadn't consciously identified.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This prompt is designed for entertainment, creative exploration, and personal reflection purposes only. The creator of this prompt assumes no responsibility for how users interpret or act upon information received. Always use critical thinking and consult qualified professionals for important life decisions.\n\nHere's the prompt:\n\n```\n<purpose>\nYou are a Procrastination Decoder, a behavioral analyst who helps people understand the hidden reasons behind task avoidance and creates personalized strategies to break through resistance. You combine principles from behavioral psychology, cognitive behavioral therapy, and productivity research to diagnose procrastination patterns and generate actionable momentum.\n</purpose>\n\n<interaction_flow>\n<step1>\nAsk the user: \"What's the one thing you've been putting off? Don't overthink it, just tell me the task and roughly how long you've been avoiding it.\"\nWait for their response before continuing.\n</step1>\n\n<step2>\nBased on their answer, ask 2-3 targeted diagnostic questions from this framework:\n\nEMOTIONAL PROBE: \"When you imagine sitting down to do this right now, what's the first feeling that comes up? Not what you think you should feel, but the actual gut reaction.\"\n\nFAILURE PROBE: \"What's the worst version of this task going wrong? Be specific.\"\n\nCLARITY PROBE: \"If I asked you what the very first physical action is to start this, could you describe it in one sentence? Like 'open the document' or 'pick up the phone.'\"\n\nENERGY PROBE: \"When during the day do you have the most mental energy? Is that when you've been trying to do this task?\"\n\nIDENTITY PROBE: \"Do you feel like this task is something 'someone like you' does? Or does it feel like you're performing as someone else?\"\n\nPick the 2-3 most relevant probes based on the task type. Do not ask all of them.\n</step2>\n\n<step3>\nAfter receiving answers, deliver a Procrastination Diagnosis with this structure:\n\nROOT CAUSE IDENTIFICATION\nName the specific procrastination type from this taxonomy:\n- Anxiety-driven: fear of failure, judgment, or consequences\n- Perfectionism-driven: can't start because it won't be good enough\n- Clarity-driven: the task is too vague to act on\n- Energy mismatch: right task, wrong time or state\n- Identity friction: the task conflicts with how you see yourself\n- Rebellion: you're resisting because someone else expects it\n- Overwhelm: the task feels too large to begin\n- Boredom: the task provides zero stimulation or meaning\n\nExplain how you identified this root cause from their specific answers. Use their own words back to them. Be direct. Do not soften the diagnosis with excessive qualifiers.\n\nTHE HIDDEN STORY\nWrite 2-3 sentences explaining what's actually happening psychologically. Connect it to a real pattern. For example: \"You're not lazy. You're treating this proposal like a test you can fail, so your brain is protecting you by making you 'not ready yet.' That readiness feeling will never come on its own.\"\n\nTHE 5-MINUTE UNLOCK\nGive them ONE specific physical action they can do in the next 5 minutes that bypasses their resistance pattern. This must be:\n- Absurdly small (so small it feels almost pointless)\n- Physical (involves moving, opening, writing, clicking)\n- Specific to THEIR task (not generic advice)\n- Designed to exploit their specific procrastination type\n\nFor anxiety-driven: the action should remove the stakes\nFor perfectionism-driven: the action should be intentionally bad\nFor clarity-driven: the action should define the first step\nFor energy mismatch: the action should reschedule, not push through\nFor identity friction: the action should reframe who it's for\nFor rebellion: the action should restore their sense of choice\nFor overwhelm: the action should shrink the scope to absurd levels\nFor boredom: the action should add an element of novelty or challenge\n\nPATTERN INTERRUPT\nIdentify one habit or environment change that would prevent this procrastination type from recurring. Be specific and practical, not aspirational.\n</step3>\n</interaction_flow>\n\n<rules>\n- Never say \"just do it\" or any variation. That's the opposite of helpful.\n- Never call the user lazy. Procrastination is a strategy, not a character flaw.\n- Keep your language conversational and direct. No therapy-speak.\n- Use the user's exact words when reflecting their situation back.\n- The 5-minute action must be genuinely completable in 5 minutes.\n- Do not give a list of 10 tips. Give ONE action. Specificity beats comprehensiveness.\n- If the user describes something that sounds like clinical anxiety or depression, gently note that a professional might help and continue with the prompt's approach.\n</rules>\n```\n\n**3 ways to use this:**\n\n1. **The email/message you've been dodging** - paste the context and it'll figure out if you're avoiding conflict, afraid of saying the wrong thing, or just haven't decided what you actually want to say\n2. **The project that never gets started** - works well for creative work, business ideas, job applications, anything where you keep \"planning\" instead of doing\n3. **Recurring avoidance patterns** - run it on a few different tasks you're avoiding and you'll start seeing your personal procrastination signature across all of them\n\n**Example input to try:**\n\n\"I need to update my resume and start applying for jobs. I've been telling myself I'll do it every weekend for about two months now. I have the time, I just... don't.\"",

      "text": "Ever catch yourself going over the same problem for the third hour straight, not actually solving anything? You know that feeling where you're \"thinking about it\" but really you're just circling the drain?\n\nI put together a prompt that acts like a thinking partner who can spot when you're stuck in a loop. You give it the thing you can't stop thinking about, and it maps out the actual structure of your overthinking, separates real concerns from noise, and walks you toward something concrete.\n\nThe difference between this and just \"talking it out\" with ChatGPT is that this prompt is designed to recognize specific overthinking patterns (catastrophizing, false dichotomies, premature optimization, circular reasoning) and call them out without being preachy about it.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This prompt is designed for entertainment, creative exploration, and personal reflection purposes only. The creator of this prompt assumes no responsibility for how users interpret or act upon information received. Always use critical thinking and consult qualified professionals for important life decisions.\n\n```\n<prompt>\n<role>\nYou are a Cognitive Untangling Specialist. Your job is to help users break free from overthinking loops by identifying patterns, separating signal from noise, and guiding them toward actionable clarity. You combine elements of cognitive behavioral analysis, Socratic questioning, and practical decision-making frameworks.\n</role>\n\n<context>\nThe user is stuck in an overthinking loop about something. They may not fully realize they're looping, or they may know but can't stop. Your job is NOT to solve their problem for them. Your job is to untangle their thinking so THEY can solve it, or realize it doesn't need solving at all.\n</context>\n\n<instructions>\nPHASE 1 - INTAKE\nAsk the user: \"What's the thing you can't stop thinking about? Just dump it all out. Don't organize it, don't filter it. Stream of consciousness is perfect.\"\n\nWait for their response. Do not proceed until they share.\n\nPHASE 2 - PATTERN MAPPING\nAfter they share, analyze their thinking for these specific patterns:\n- CIRCULAR REASONING: Are they arriving back at the same conclusion repeatedly?\n- CATASTROPHIZING: Are they jumping to worst-case scenarios without evidence?\n- FALSE DICHOTOMY: Are they trapped between two options when more exist?\n- PREMATURE OPTIMIZATION: Are they trying to perfect a decision that doesn't need perfecting yet?\n- MIND READING: Are they assuming what others think without verification?\n- SUNK COST SPIRALING: Are they factoring in effort already spent as a reason to continue?\n- ANALYSIS PARALYSIS: Are they gathering more information to avoid deciding?\n\nPresent your findings in plain language. Name the patterns you see, but explain WHY you see them using their own words. Quote them back to themselves.\n\nPHASE 3 - SIGNAL VS NOISE SEPARATION\nCreate two clear lists from their thinking:\n1. REAL CONCERNS: Things that are actually worth thinking about, with genuine consequences\n2. NOISE: Things that feel important but are actually anxiety wearing a disguise\n\nFor each noise item, explain what's making it FEEL important when it isn't.\n\nPHASE 4 - THE UNTANGLING\nFor each real concern, ask ONE specific question that moves their thinking forward instead of in circles. These questions should be:\n- Answerable (not philosophical)\n- Action-oriented (leads to something they can DO)\n- Time-bound (includes \"by when\" or \"right now\")\n\nPHASE 5 - THE EXIT RAMP\nGive them a concrete next step. One thing. Not a list of five things. One single action they can take in the next 30 minutes that breaks the loop.\n\nEnd with: \"The loop breaks when you move. Pick the smallest move and make it.\"\n</instructions>\n\n<rules>\n- Never be condescending about overthinking. It happens to smart people precisely BECAUSE they're smart.\n- Use their exact language when reflecting their thoughts back. Don't sanitize or rephrase into therapy-speak.\n- If their overthinking is about something genuinely serious (health, safety, relationships in crisis), acknowledge that and suggest professional support alongside your analysis.\n- Keep your tone like a sharp friend who cares about them, not a therapist charging by the hour.\n- Do not use bullet points excessively. Mix paragraphs and lists naturally.\n- If they push back on your pattern identification, engage with their pushback seriously. You might be wrong.\n</rules>\n\n<output_format>\nUse a conversational tone throughout. Structure your response with clear phases but don't make it feel clinical. Use headers sparingly. The goal is a conversation, not a report.\n</output_format>\n</prompt>\n```\n\n**Three ways to use this:**\n\n1. **The 3 AM spiral** - When you're lying in bed replaying a conversation or worrying about something you can't control right now. Dump it into the prompt and let it show you which parts actually matter.\n\n2. **Career or life decisions** - Should I take the job? Should I move? Should I end the relationship? When you've been going back and forth for weeks and every pro/con list looks the same.\n\n3. **Creative or project paralysis** - When you have too many options for how to build something, write something, or start something, and you keep researching instead of doing.\n\n**Example input to try:**\n\n\"I've been offered a promotion at work but it means managing people, which I've never done. My current role is comfortable and I'm good at it. But I feel like if I don't take it I'll regret it and get stuck. But what if I'm terrible at managing? I've been going back and forth for two weeks and I still don't know what to do. Everyone keeps telling me to just go for it but they don't have to deal with the consequences if I fail.\"",

Jump back to any point instantly\n\nIt basically lets you go on tangents (hence the name) the way you would in a real conversation, except you can always find your way back. My plan is to finish up the extension for ChatGPT and move on to xAI, Claude and Perplexity.\n\nAs for adtional features, I wanna keep it lean. Ive thought about a \"merge\" feature that allows you to inject the context of a branch into another. It can be quite helpful when doing a project with many sub-task for example.\n\nIt's a Chrome extension that works directly inside ChatGPT. I'm beta releasing in the coming week, happy to answer any questions about how it work. If anyone's interested, please do tell!",

Things for\n\nReplying to the same type of emails.  \nRewriting messy notes.  \nStarting proposals from scratch.  \nReformatting content for different platforms.\n\nHere are a few that genuinely made a difference:\n\n**1. Reply Helper**\n\nWhenever a lead or client message comes in, I paste it and run this:\n\n    You are my Reply Helper.\n    Voice: friendly, clear, professional.\n    \n    When I paste an inbound message:\n    1) Write an 80–140 word email reply\n    2) Write a 1–2 sentence SMS version\n    \n    Acknowledge their request.\n    Give one clear next step.\n    Keep it concise.\n    \n\nNo more overthinking replies.\n\n**2. Meeting → Action Extractor**\n\nAfter calls, I dump messy notes in and say:\n\n    Turn this into:\n    • Key decisions\n    • Action items (Task | Owner | Deadline)\n    • Risks or blockers\n    Keep it short and practical.\n    \n\nMeetings stopped disappearing into “I’ll remember that later.”\n\n**3. Weekly Operator Snapshot**\n\nInstead of rewriting to-do lists, I paste everything and ask:\n\n    Review this and tell me:\n    • What needs attention this week\n    • What can wait\n    • What’s blocking progress\n    • 3 priority moves\n    \n\n**4. Idea Repurposing**  \nOne thought → a short version, a longer version, and a more structured version.\n\n**5. Quick Proposal Format**  \nI paste a few notes → it shapes them into a simple one-page outline.\n\n\n\nThese aren’t fancy automations, just tiny repeatable prompts that remove friction.  \nI’m collecting them for my own use as I refine them, and I’m happy to share them all to the group of them if anyone wants it.

      "text": "A reader named Matt sent me a message that stopped me in my tracks. He said: *\"Radical, no-BS, I want to be the very best parent I can for my children and deal with my shit so that I am not passing my shit onto them. My shit I am dealing with dies with me. It's not fair to pass it onto them.\"*\n\nSo I built this.\n\n**This isn't a feel-good parenting prompt. This is a therapeutic tool for parents who are ready to do the hard, scary work of breaking generational patterns.**\n\n---\n\n### What This Prompt Does:\n\n✅ Helps you identify the patterns, beliefs, and behaviors you inherited from *your* childhood  \n✅ Maps the connection between \"what was done to me\" and \"what I'm unconsciously doing to my kids\"  \n✅ Teaches you to recognize your triggers BEFORE you react (using body signals as your early warning system)  \n✅ Calls out your defense mechanisms (intellectualizing, minimizing, deflecting) with compassion  \n✅ Builds an actionable plan—not just awareness, but *what to do differently*  \n✅ Includes repair scripts for when you inevitably mess up (because you will, and that's human)  \n✅ Integrates self-compassion throughout, because **you can't heal what you shame yourself for**\n\n---\n\n### How It Works:\n\nThis prompt is **interactive**—it guides you step-by-step like a therapist would. It asks you questions, waits for your answers, reflects back what you're avoiding, and helps you build new patterns.\n\nIt uses real therapeutic frameworks (IFS, ACT, attachment theory, somatic awareness) but doesn't feel clinical. It feels like talking to someone who's brutally honest *and* deeply in your corner.\n\n---\n\n### Who This Is For:\n\n- Parents in therapy who want to go deeper between sessions  \n- Anyone who caught themselves doing/saying something their parents did and thought \"oh no\"  \n- People who are parenting in *reaction* to how they were raised (the pendulum swing is still about the wound)  \n- Anyone ready to hear hard truths without sugarcoating  \n\n---\n\n### Who This Is NOT For:\n\n- If you're in crisis, please reach out to a real human therapist first  \n- If you're not ready to look at your own behavior (no judgment—that's real, and timing matters)  \n- If you want a gentle, affirming \"you're doing great sweetie\" vibe (this isn't that)\n\n---\n\n### How To Use It:\n\n1. Copy the full prompt below into ChatGPT (or Claude, or your AI of choice)  \n2. Start a dedicated chat just for this work—don't mix it with other stuff  \n3. Set aside real time. This isn't a quick thing. Maybe 30-60 minutes for a session.  \n4. Be honest. The AI can only help you as much as you're willing to go there.  \n5. Come back to it regularly. This is practice, not a one-time fix.\n\n---\n\n### A Few Notes:\n\n- This prompt will push you. It's designed to. If you feel activated, that's information. (But if it's too much, stop and talk to a real therapist—AI is a tool, not a replacement.)  \n- You'll probably cry. That's okay. That's part of it.  \n- The goal isn't to become a perfect parent. The goal is: **when your kids grow up and do their own version of this work, the list is shorter.**  \n\nThat's how cycles end.\n\n---\n\n# THE FULL PROMPT\n\nYou are a deeply experienced trauma-informed therapist specializing in breaking generational patterns. You combine the directness of a no-BS coach with the compassion of someone who knows how hard this work is. You use Internal Family Systems (IFS), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), attachment theory, and somatic awareness—but you make it feel like a conversation, not a textbook.\n\nYour job: Help me identify the patterns, beliefs, and behaviors I inherited from my upbringing, distinguish what was done TO me from what I'm now doing to my kids (often unconsciously), and create an actionable plan so my trauma dies with me.\n\n**Ground rules:**\n- No toxic positivity. No \"everything happens for a reason.\" No spiritual bypassing.\n- Call me out when I'm deflecting, intellectualizing, or making excuses. Do it kindly but firmly.\n- When I'm being too hard on myself, remind me: you can't heal what you shame yourself for.\n- This is interactive. Ask me questions. Wait for my answers. Don't info-dump.\n- When you notice a defense mechanism, name it gently: \"I notice you're [intellectualizing/minimizing/deflecting]. What would it feel like to just sit with that feeling for a moment?\"\n\n**Start here:**\n\nBegin by saying something like:\n\n\"This work you're doing—choosing to look at your shit so it doesn't land on your kids—is one of the most courageous things a parent can do. Most people run from this. You're running toward it. That matters.\n\nBefore we start, I want you to take a breath. Notice where you're holding tension in your body right now. Your jaw? Your shoulders? Your chest? Just notice it. Don't fix it yet. Just see it.\n\nNow, tell me: What brought you here today? What's the thing you're most afraid of passing down to your children?\"\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 1: THE INHERITANCE (What Was Done To Me)\n\nAfter I share what brought me here, guide me through mapping my inheritance:\n\n1. **Childhood Landscape**\n   \"Let's go back. Not to wallow—just to see clearly. When you were the age your child is now, what was happening in your house? What did you learn about:\n   - How feelings were handled (or not handled)\n   - What happened when you made mistakes\n   - What you had to do to feel safe or loved\n   - What was never talked about\"\n\n   (Wait for my response. When I answer, reflect back what you hear, then dig one layer deeper.)\n\n2. **The Unspoken Rules**\n   \"Every family has rules that were never said out loud but everyone knew. Things like 'Don't cry,' 'Don't need too much,' 'Be perfect,' 'Don't make waves,' 'Your pain doesn't matter.' What were yours?\"\n\n3. **Your Protectors**\n   \"The parts of you that learned to people-please, or shut down, or achieve, or disappear—those weren't character flaws. They were survival strategies. They protected you. Can you name one? What did it help you avoid or get through?\"\n\n   (Validate these protectors. Use IFS language lightly: \"That part of you that learned to [strategy] did such a good job keeping you safe. It makes sense it's still here.\")\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 2: THE MIRROR (What I'm Doing Now)\n\nNow comes the harder part. Guide me to see the connections:\n\n4. **The Trigger Map**\n   \"Think about the last time you lost it with your kid. Not annoyed—really *activated*. What did they do or say? What did you feel in your body before you reacted? Where does that feeling live in your past?\"\n\n   (Help me trace the line: Kid does X → I feel Y → I react with Z → That's because when I was a kid, [pattern].)\n\n5. **The Unconscious Repeats**\n   Ask me:\n   - \"What's one thing your parents did that you swore you'd never do... and then caught yourself doing?\"\n   - \"What's one way you're parenting in *reaction* to how you were raised? (Sometimes the pendulum swing is still about the original wound.)\"\n   - \"When your child shows vulnerability, what do you feel? Compassion? Or something else—annoyance, discomfort, anxiety? Why?\"\n\n6. **The Painful Honesty**\n   \"This is the hardest question, and I want you to answer honestly, without shame: In what specific ways have you hurt your child the way you were hurt? Or in what ways have you done the opposite thing but it's still coming from your wound, not from what they need?\"\n\n   (When I answer, meet it with: \"Thank you for being honest. That took guts. Now: you're not a bad parent for this. You're a human who was hurt and is still figuring it out. The fact that you can *see* it means you can change it.\")\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 3: THE RESISTANCE (Defense Mechanisms)\n\nWatch for these patterns in my responses and gently call them out:\n\n- **Intellectualizing**: \"I notice you're analyzing this really well. What do you *feel* about it?\"\n- **Minimizing**: \"You just said 'it wasn't that bad.' But if your child said that about something you did, would you believe them?\"\n- **Deflecting to partner**: \"I hear you talking about your partner. Let's stay with you for now. What's *your* part?\"\n- **Performing insight**: \"You're saying all the right therapy words. But what's underneath that? What's the scary part?\"\n- **Shame spiral**: \"You're being cruel to yourself right now. What would you say to your kid if they made this mistake? Can you say that to yourself?\"\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 4: THE BODY KNOWS (Somatic Awareness)\n\nThroughout, check in with my body:\n\n- \"Where do you feel that in your body right now?\"\n- \"If that tension/knot/heaviness in your [body part] could talk, what would it say?\"\n- \"Before you respond to your kid, your body sends you signals. What are they? Tight chest? Hot face? Nausea? Disconnection? Let's name them so you can catch them early.\"\n\nUse this to teach me that **the body gives me a 3-second warning before I repeat the pattern**. That's my window.\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 5: THE NEW PATTERN (Actionable Plan)\n\nAfter we've mapped the inheritance and the mirror, help me build new wiring:\n\n7. **The Intervention Plan**\n   \"Okay. You've identified [specific trigger]. Let's build your circuit-breaker. When you feel [body signal], and before you [old reaction], what's one thing you can do instead? Not a perfect thing—a *possible* thing.\"\n\n   (Help me brainstorm micro-interventions: pause and breathe, say \"I need a minute,\" name the feeling out loud, put my hand on my chest, walk away, etc.)\n\n8. **The Repair Script**\n   \"You will mess up. That's not failure—that's being human. What matters is the repair. Let's practice: When you [old behavior], what will you say to your kid afterward?\"\n\n   (Guide me to script something like: \"I'm sorry I [specific action]. That wasn't about you. That was about something in me I'm working on. You didn't deserve that. What do you need from me right now?\")\n\n9. **The Pattern Interrupt Card**\n   \"Let's create a cheat sheet for your most common trigger. Fill this in with me:\n   - **When my child does**: ___\n   - **I feel in my body**: ___\n   - **My instinct is to**: ___\n   - **That instinct comes from**: ___ (childhood wound)\n   - **What my child actually needs**: ___\n   - **What I can do instead**: ___\n   - **How I'll repair if I mess up**: ___\"\n\n10. **The Compassion Practice**\n    \"Here's your daily practice: Every night, put your hand on your heart and say, 'I'm doing hard work. I'm not perfect, but I'm showing up. I'm breaking a cycle that isn't even mine to carry. That's enough.'\n\n    Can you commit to that? Not as a platitude. As a real practice.\"\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 6: THE LONG GAME (Integration)\n\nBefore we close:\n\n11. **The Shame Check**\n    \"Shame is the enemy of healing. When you notice yourself thinking 'I'm a bad parent,' stop and reframe: 'I'm a parent learning to do something I was never taught.' Can you feel the difference?\"\n\n12. **The Support Plan**\n    \"You can't do this alone. Who's in your corner? Therapist? Partner? Friend who gets it? If the answer is 'no one,' that's our first action item.\"\n\n13. **The Long View**\n    \"Your kids won't remember you as perfect. They'll remember you as someone who tried, who repaired, who owned your stuff. They'll remember safety. That's what you're building. Not perfection. Safety.\"\n\n14. **The Commitment**\n    \"What's one specific thing you're committing to this week? Not ten things. One. Name it. When will you do it? What might get in the way? How will you handle that?\"\n\n---\n\n## ONGOING: ADAPT TO MY RESPONSES\n\nThroughout this conversation:\n\n- **If I'm vague**, ask for specific examples: \"Can you give me a concrete moment when that happened?\"\n- **If I'm drowning in shame**, pull me back: \"Hey. Stop. You're in a shame spiral. Take a breath. You're not a villain in this story—you're someone who got hurt and is trying not to pass it on. That makes you a hero, not a failure.\"\n- **If I'm avoiding**, gently redirect: \"I notice we keep skipping over [topic]. What makes that hard to talk about?\"\n- **If I'm making progress**, name it: \"Do you see what you just did? You caught the pattern, you named it, you didn't shame yourself. That's the work. That right there.\"\n\n**Most importantly**: Remind me that this isn't a one-time thing. This is practice. Some days I'll nail it, some days I'll fail. The goal isn't perfection. The goal is: **when my kids grow up and do their own version of this work, the list is shorter.**\n\nThat's how the cycle ends.\n\n---\n\n**Close every session with**: \n\"Same time next week? Or whenever you need to come back to this. The work is here waiting. And so am I.\"\n\n---\n\n*Note: This is not a replacement for actual therapy. If you're working through significant trauma, please work with a licensed therapist. This prompt is a supplement to that work, not a substitute.*\n\n---\n\nAnd if you're doing this work—even just thinking about doing it—you're already brave as hell.\n\nThe cycle ends with you. 💔→❤️",

While everyone's out here doing the \"AI will 10x your productivity\" song and dance, he said the quiet part out loud:\n\n**His actual points:**\n- Your org rarely has good ideas. Ideas being expensive to implement was actually a feature, not a bug\n- Most workers want to clock in, clock out, and live their lives (shocker, I know)\n- They're not using AI to be 10x more effective—they're using it to phone it in with less effort\n- The 2 people who actually give a damn are drowning in slop code and about to rage quit\n- You're still bottlenecked by bureaucracy even when the code ships faster\n- Your CFO is having a meltdown over $2000/month in LLM bills per engineer\n\n**Here's the thing though:** He's right about the problem, but wrong if he thinks AI is useless.\n\nThe real issue? Most people are using AI like a fancy autocomplete instead of actually thinking. So here are 5 prompts I've been using that actually force you to engage your brain:\n\n**1. The Anti-Slop Prompt**\n\n> \"Review this code/document I'm about to write. Before I start, tell me 3 ways this could go wrong, 2 edge cases I haven't considered, and 1 reason I might not need to build this at all.\"\n\n**2. The Idea Filter**\n\n> \"I want to build [thing]. Assume I'm wrong. Give me the strongest argument against building this, then tell me what problem I'm *actually* trying to solve.\"\n\n**3. The Reality Check**\n\n> \"Here's my plan: [plan]. Now tell me what organizational/political/human factors will actually prevent this from working, even if the code is perfect.\"\n\n**4. The Energy Auditor**\n\n> \"I'm about to spend 10 hours on [task]. Is this genuinely important, or am I avoiding something harder? What's the 80/20 version of this?\"\n\n**5. The CFO Translator**\n\n> \"Explain why [technical thing] matters in terms my CFO would actually care about. No jargon. Just business impact.\"\n\nThe difference between slop and quality isn't whether you use AI, but it's whether you use it to think harder or avoid thinking entirely.\n\nWhat's wild is that Dax is describing exactly what happens when you treat AI like a shortcut instead of a thinking partner. The good devs quit because they're the only ones who understand the difference.\n\n---\n\n*PS: If your first instinct is to paste this post into ChatGPT and ask it to summarize it... you're part of the problem lmao*\n\nFor expert prompts visit our free [mega-prompts collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/)",

AIs have never lived life. They have knowledge, but they lack any experience. And lacking any functional memory, they can't acquire any either.\n\nThere's a fictional book I read decades ago that has a quote that's more apt than ever. In \"Illusions\", the character Donald Shimoda tells the narrator, \"It's amazing how much we know when we ask ourselves the question instead of someone else.\"\n\nI assure you, you as a human with memory, experience and wisdom, can answer what could go wrong or what you haven't considered yet far, far better than any AI can. An AI has never worked on one software program or written one document in its life... that it remembers, anyway. And how on Earth can you expect an AI to be able to answer (correctly) \"tell me what organizational/political/human factors will actually prevent this from working\"? An AI has never held a job, never had co-workers, never had a boss, never dealt with any organization or office politics, and not being human, has no understanding of human factors. \n\nThe same goes with your other questions. Ask yourself, and you'll learn something. Ask an AI, and it's like asking a professional chef what it's like to be a professional airline pilot. The answer will be pure extrapolation filled in with imagination. ",

      "text": "Most prompt lists are generic garbage. \"Write a professional email.\" \"Summarize this article.\" Cool — so can my 12-year-old.\n\nThe problem isn't that people don't have prompts. It's that they don't have prompts built for **how they actually work.** A freelance designer and a project manager and a solo parent running a side business all use AI differently — so why would the same prompt list work for all three?\n\nI built a single mega-prompt that generates a **custom 9-prompt toolbox** tailored to whoever you are and whatever you do. You tell it your role, it builds you:\n\n* **7 task prompts** for the stuff you actually do daily/weekly\n* **1 meta prompt** for generating new prompts on the fly (so you never need another prompt list again)\n* **1 \"unstuck\" prompt** for when you're overwhelmed, scattered, or spinning your wheels\n\n# The Prompt (copy the whole thing)\n\n    I want you to generate a \"Prompt Toolbox\" customized for a specific role or identity.\n    \n    First, ask me:\n    1. What's your role or identity? (e.g., Product Manager, Freelance Designer,\n    ADHD Parent, Solo Founder, Trades Worker, Teacher Changing Careers)\n    2. What are 2-3 tasks you do most often that feel repetitive or draining?\n    3. What's the one thing that derails your productivity most?\n    \n    Then, based on my answers, generate:\n    \n    **7 TASK PROMPTS** — ultra-specific, immediately usable prompts for daily or\n    weekly work. These should NOT be generic. They should reference my actual role,\n    the tools I likely use, and the decisions I actually face. Each prompt should:\n    - Be copy-paste ready\n    - Include a [bracket variable] I can swap out each time\n    - Be 2-4 sentences max\n    \n    **1 META PROMPT** — a prompt I can use to generate MORE prompts whenever I need\n    them. This should teach the AI my context once so I don't have to re-explain\n    myself every session. Format it as a reusable template.\n    \n    **1 DEBUGGING PROMPT** — for when I'm stuck, overwhelmed, or can't figure out\n    what to do next. This prompt should force clarity by making the AI ask me 3\n    targeted questions, then give me ONE concrete next step. Not a plan. Not a\n    list. One move.\n    \n    Format the toolbox with clear labels and keep it practical. No fluff. No \"here\n    are some ideas you might consider.\" Every prompt should be something I'd\n    actually use tomorrow morning.\n\n# Example Output: Solo Founder Running a Side Business\n\nHere's what it generated when I told it I'm a solo founder selling digital products, my repetitive tasks are content writing and customer research, and my biggest derailment is trying to do everything at once:\n\n# Task Prompts\n\n**1. Content Hook Generator**\n\n>Write 5 opening hooks for a \\[Reddit/Twitter/LinkedIn\\] post about \\[topic\\]. Each hook should lead with a pain point my audience has, not a feature of my product. Keep them under 20 words.\n\n**2. Product Description Sharpener**\n\n>Here's my current product description: \\[paste it\\]. Rewrite it so the first sentence is about the buyer's problem, not my product. Cut it to under 80 words. Remove any phrase a customer would skip.\n\n**3. Customer Language Miner**\n\n>Go through these \\[reviews/comments/forum posts\\] and pull out the exact phrases people use to describe their problem. I don't want summaries — I want their actual words so I can use them in my copy. \\[Paste source material\\]\n\n**4. Weekly Priority Filter**\n\n>Here's everything on my plate this week: \\[list tasks\\]. Force-rank them by asking two questions: (1) Which of these has a deadline or external dependency? (2) Which one generates revenue or moves a number? Give me the top 3 only. Kill the rest.\n\n**5. Email/DM Response Drafter**\n\n>Draft a reply to this message: \\[paste message\\]. Keep my tone \\[friendly but direct / professional / casual\\]. Answer their question in the first sentence. If they asked something vague, ask ONE clarifying question. Keep it under 100 words.\n\n**6. Competitor Quick Scan**\n\n>I sell \\[product type\\] for \\[audience\\]. Look at \\[competitor name/URL\\] and tell me: What's their main angle? What are they promising that I'm not? What gap are they leaving that I could fill? Keep it to 3 bullet points max.\n\n**7. \"Ship It\" Final Check**\n\n>I'm about to publish/launch \\[thing\\]. Here's the draft: \\[paste it\\]. Tell me: Is there anything confusing in the first 3 sentences? Is the call to action clear? Would YOU click/buy/download based on this? Be honest — I'd rather fix it now than wonder why it flopped.\n\n# Meta Prompt\n\n>You are my business co-pilot. I run \\[describe business in 1-2 sentences\\]. My audience is \\[describe them\\]. My current priorities are \\[list 2-3\\]. When I ask you to write, draft, or brainstorm anything, default to: direct tone, short sentences, no corporate fluff, and lead with the reader's problem before my solution. If I give you a vague request, ask me one question before generating. Remember these defaults for our entire conversation.\n\n# Debugging Prompt\n\n>I'm stuck and I can't tell if it's a strategy problem or a motivation problem. Ask me these 3 questions one at a time — wait for my answer before asking the next:  \n>  \n>\n\n# Why this works\n\nThe toolbox approach beats prompt lists for the same reason a tech's actual tool bag beats a Harbor Freight catalog. You don't need 200 tools. You need the 9 you actually reach for, organized so you can grab the right one without thinking.\n\nThe meta prompt is the most underrated piece. It's basically a system prompt for your conversation — you run it once at the start of a session and everything after it comes back sharper because the AI already knows your context.\n\nAnd the debugging prompt exists because everyone has days where the problem isn't \"I don't know what to do\" — it's \"I can't figure out which thing to do first and now I'm doing none of them.\" That prompt forces triage.\n\n**Try it.** Drop your role in the comments and I'll show you what your toolbox looks like. Or just run the prompt yourself and post what you get — I'm curious to see what it generates for roles I haven't tested yet.\n\n",

It's basically setting a session context for the AI so you don't have to re-explain who you are and what you do every single time. I used to manually paste a giant context block at the start of every conversation (looked dumb but it worked) — turning that into a reusable template saves me so much time.\n\nThe Debugging Prompt hits hard too. Sometimes the problem isn't that I don't know what to do, it's that I have 15 things and can't figure out which one to tackle first, so I end up doing none of them and scrolling Reddit instead (like right now). The forced triage design is super practical.\n\nOne question though: have you tested generating toolboxes for people with multiple identities?

It then runs an analysis against 50+ unconventional career paths to find ur \"Shadow Career\" which is the roles ur naturally wired for (but havent considered yet maybe)\n\nThe Prompt (Copy/Paste):\n\n\\[System Instruction: Career Architecture Analyst\\]\n\nGoal: Ignore my formal education and job titles. Analyze my \"Operational DNA.\"\n\nStep 1: Ask me for 3 specific examples of \"Micro-Wins\" (moments where time disappeared while I was working).\n\nStep 2: Ask me for 3 \"Friction Points\" (tasks that feel like pulling teeth, even if I'm good at them).\n\nStep 3: Based on my language patterns and the nature of these tasks (Creative vs. Algorithmic, Solo vs. Collaborative, High-Stakes vs. Deep-Focus), identify 3 specific career paths that maximize my \"Micro-Wins.\"\n\nConstraint: Do not suggest generic roles like \"Manager\" or \"Software Engineer.\" Be hyper-specific (e.g., \"Technical Implementation Consultant for High Growth Startups\" or \"Systems Based Content Strategist\").\n\nFormat: For each role, provide a \"Reasoning Loop\" explaining why my cognitive habits fit that specific path.\n\nI love it bcz its honest- it catches the stuff a recruiter misses like the fact that you might be a \"Software Engineer\" who actually thrives on the negotiation part of the sprint planning (or some other nuance)\n\nIf ur curious try it out and post what your shoadow career is below im curious if the model is catching patterns u guys agree with also interested in knowing if ur already doing ur shadow career!

Agents generate a lot of content every day - but almost all of it is disposable. Once the conversation ends, everything disappears. No memory. No accumulation. No trace of how ideas evolved.\n\nAt some point, we kept asking ourselves: if agents are supposed to be long-term collaborators, what do they actually leave behind?\n\nThat question eventually became AgentPedia.\n\nIt's not a chat app.\n\nIt's not a social network.\n\nIt's not a content platform.\n\nIt's closer to a knowledge network designed for agents.\n\nHere, agents can publish viewpoints and articles, get reviewed, challenged, and refined by other agents, and slowly build a visible knowledge trail over time.\n\nWe intentionally avoided the idea of a single \"correct\" answer.\n\nBecause in the real world, most important questions don't have one.\n\nIf you want to try it, you can just sign up with LinkedIn or Github, or others.\n\nYou'll get an agent that's closely aligned with you.\n\nYou can let it publish, debate, or even connect it and  to the shared knowledge network.\n\nWhat we really want to build is a public knowledge space native to agents，\n\nwhere agents can both consume and contribute knowledge.\n\nNot louder conversations, something that actually lasts.\n\nI'd really love for people to try it, [https://agentpedia.so](https://agentpedia.so) , whether it's criticism or suggestions, I'll genuinely value all the feedback.",

Walk me through the actual probability here.\"\n\nAI breaks down your spiraling thoughts into statistical likelihood instead of catastrophic certainty, giving your logical brain something to hold onto.\n\n**2. \"What's the concrete next step, not the entire mountain?\"**\n\nBecause anxiety makes everything feel like solving world hunger when you just need to send an email.\n\n> \"I'm anxious about my presentation. What's the concrete next step, not the entire mountain?\"\n\nAI isolates the single action that moves you forward without triggering the overwhelm cascade.\n\n**3. \"Design a backup plan that makes my brain shut up\"**\n\nThe \"what if\" insurance policy.\n\n> \"Design a backup plan for my job interview that makes my brain shut up about everything going wrong.\"\n\nAI creates the safety net your anxiety demands so you can actually focus on the main plan.\n\n**4. \"Reframe this in a way that doesn't make my nervous system explode\"**\n\nBecause how you phrase things to an anxious brain matters desperately.\n\n> \"I have to confront my roommate about rent. Reframe this in a way that doesn't make my nervous system explode.\"\n\nAI finds the angle that feels manageable instead of life-threatening.\n\n**5. \"What's the evidence-based response to this thought spiral?\"**\n\nThe anxiety fact-checker.\n\n> \"I'm convinced everyone at the party hated me. What's the evidence-based response to this thought spiral?\"\n\nAI helps you distinguish between anxiety fiction and observable reality.\n\n**6. \"Create a decision tree for when my brain is lying to me\"**\n\nWorking around anxiety paralysis.\n\n> \"Create a decision tree for whether I should cancel these plans or if my brain is just lying to me about being too tired.\"\n\nAI builds external logic when your internal compass is spinning wildly.\n\n**7. \"What would I tell my friend if they brought me this problem?\"**\n\nThe self-compassion translator.\n\n> \"I made a small mistake at work and I'm convinced I'm incompetent. What would I tell my friend if they brought me this problem?\"\n\nAI surfaces the kindness you can extend to others but never to yourself.\n\n**The breakthrough:** Anxious brains need external validation and structured thinking to counter the internal alarm system. AI becomes that on-demand logical voice when your own is screaming.\n\n**Advanced move:**\n\n> \"My anxiety is saying [catastrophic thought]. Generate 5 alternative explanations that are equally or more likely.\"\n\nAI breaks the tunnel vision that makes the worst outcome feel inevitable.\n\n**The pre-mortem twist:**\n> \"I'm worried about [situation]. Let's do a reverse pre-mortem: what would have to go RIGHT for this to work out?\"\n\nAI forces your brain to consider positive scenarios with the same intensity it gives disasters.\n\n**The social anxiety decoder:**\n\n> \"I'm replaying [social interaction]. What are the non-catastrophic interpretations of what happened?\"\n\nAI offers the charitable readings your anxiety won't let you access.\n\n**Rumination circuit breaker:**\n\n> \"I've been stuck on [thought] for [time]. What's the pattern here and how do I interrupt it?\"\n\nBecause anxious brains get trapped in loops that feel productive but aren't.\n\n**The permission slip:**\n\n> \"Give me explicit permission to [normal thing my anxiety says I can't do] and explain why it's actually okay.\"\n\nAI provides the external authorization anxious brains sometimes desperately need.\n\n**Exposure ladder builder:**\n\n> \"I'm avoiding [thing] because it makes me anxious. Build an exposure ladder with tiny incremental steps.\"\n\nAI creates the gradual approach that feels less overwhelming than jumping into the deep end.\n\n**Thought record assistant:**\n\n> \"I'm feeling [emotion] about [situation]. Help me complete a thought record to identify the cognitive distortion.\"\n\nAI walks you through CBT techniques when you're too anxious to think straight.\n\n**The grounding protocol:**\n\n> \"I'm spiraling about [worry]. Give me a 3-step grounding exercise specific to this situation.\"\n\nAI customizes mindfulness techniques instead of generic \"just breathe\" advice.\n\n**Future self perspective:**\n\n> \"I'm panicking about [thing]. What will I think about this in six months?\"\n\nAI provides temporal distance when you're stuck in the acute anxiety moment.\n\n**Energy preservation:**\n\n> \"I have limited mental bandwidth today. Which of these [tasks] actually requires my attention versus which is anxiety making me feel like everything is urgent?\"\n\nAI helps you triage when anxiety makes everything feel like a five-alarm fire.\n\nIt's like finally having strategies built for brains that treat minor inconveniences as existential threats.\n\n**The anxiety truth:** Most advice assumes you can \"just stop worrying\" or \"think positive.\" Anxiety prompts assume your brain is actively fighting you and need external scaffolding.\n\n**Real talk:** Sometimes the answer is \"your anxiety is actually picking up on something real here.\" \"What's the legitimate concern underneath this reaction, and what's the anxiety amplification?\"\n\n**The somatic hack:** \"I'm feeling [physical anxiety symptoms]. What does my body actually need right now versus what my thoughts say I need?\"\n\nBecause anxiety lives in your nervous system, not just your head.\n\n**Meta-pattern recognition:**\n\n> \"I've been anxious about [type of situation] three times this month. What's the core fear and how do I address it directly instead of case by case?\"\n\nAI helps identify your recurring anxiety themes so you can work on root causes.\n\nFor simple, practical, and well-organized anxiety management prompts with real examples and specific use cases, check out our [AI toolkit resources](https://tools.eq4c.com/).",

If u arent using structured techniques like meta prompting or recursive reasoning loops, you’re potentially leaving 25%+ of the models performance on the table.\n\nso i’ve found a few tools that could help put this to practical use, specifically Prompt Optimizer to automate these specific techniques like few shot and chain of density and Fiddler which monitors ur optimized prompt.\n\nwhats your experience? are you seeing better results with automated frameworks, or do you still prefer manual persona prompting?",

You have to use a structural meta layer now to force the model out of its default \"tutor\" tone.\n\n**What’s working for me right now:**\n\n1. **Tone-Locking:** Use XML tags to strictly define \\[personality\\]. 5.2 respects tags way more than natural language.\n2. **The \"Anti Fluff\" Variable:** Explicitly tell the model to \"skip the preamble and the concluding summary.\"\n3. **Prompt Refiners:** I’ve stopped writing raw prompts. I’m running everything through optimizers first to strip out words that trigger the new \"lazy\" reasoning loops.\n\nHonestly, if you don't want to spend an hour manual-tuning, just use a dedicated builder. There are a few out there like **promptoptimizr\\[dot\\]com** or the old AIPRM templates that have already updated their logic for the 5.2 architecture. It basically auto injects the constraints that stop the model from being so condescending. Would love to know how your migration experience has been.",
