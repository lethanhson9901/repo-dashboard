      "text": "so this comes from chris voss. former lead fbi international kidnapping negotiator. wrote a book called never split the difference thats basically the bible for high stakes negotiation.\n\nhis whole thing is that normal business logic like \"lets meet halfway\" or \"win-win\" is actually a losing strategy. the real move is something called tactical empathy combined with no-oriented questions.\n\nsounds backwards right?\n\nyou dont want them to say yes. yes is usually a lie to make you go away. you want them to say \"thats right.\" thats when you know youve actually got them.\n\nso i had this saas vendor trying to raise my prices by 20% on renewal. and instead of doing what everyone does (writing some polite email begging for a discount with budget justifications) i decided to let chatgpt write it using voss's framework.\n\nthe key was telling the ai what NOT to do.\n\nno logic. no arguments about budget. no apologizing. no asking for anything directly.\n\ninstead i told it to use labeling (stuff like \"it seems like you feel...\") and end with what voss calls a calibrated question. basically a how or what question that forces them to solve your problem for you.\n\ni used another prompt that i am sharing in the comments, the core principles were the same:\n\nthe ai output this:\n\n\"it seems like you're under a lot of pressure to increase revenue this quarter. it sounds like you feel that our current pricing is unfair to the value you provide. how am i supposed to agree to a 20% increase when our usage has remained flat?\"\n\nthats it. thats the whole email.\n\nfelt almost rude to send tbh. no pleasantries. no \"i hope this finds you well.\" just straight psychological judo.\n\nthe vendor replied in 10 minutes. dropped the increase entirely. locked in old rate for 2 years.\n\nwhy did this work?\n\nbecause sales reps are trained to handle objections. they have scripts for \"its too expensive\" and \"i need to check with my boss\" and \"can you do better on price.\"\n\nbut they have no script for \"how am i supposed to do that?\"\n\nthat question bypasses their training completely. suddenly theyre not defending their price - theyre problem solving WITH you. theyre negotiating against themselves.\n\nthe thing most people miss is that chatgpt defaults to sounding helpful and professional. which is exactly what gets ignored. the hack isnt getting ai to write your negotiation emails. its getting ai to write them wrong on purpose.\n\nstrip the logic. add the empathy. ask the impossible question.\n\nlet them figure out how to say yes.",

Start with rate increase to test the waters and get attention, land on extention at the same price so they feel like they got a deal, option C was to \"let me see what I can do\" if the extention was stalling and we needed the business. Would then change the terms to hit our profitability targets such as reduced services, change duration, reduce the rate for being a \"loyal customer\" etc...This rep landed on what they wanted. Its like a steakhouse having a $79 steak on the menu so you feel good about ordering the $39 steak instead of the $16 burger.",

                  "text": "Here are a few different manipulation strategies Rose could use to secure her exclusive spot on the door, ranging from emotional blackmail to corporate maneuvering.\n\n1. The \"Gaslight\" Strategy\nGoal: Make Jack doubt his own perception of reality and the physics of the door to make him withdraw voluntarily.\n\n> Rose: \"Jack, I think the freezing water is messing with your depth perception. This door is actually tiny. It looks big to you because your brain is shutting down from hypothermia, but honestly? It’s basically a splinter. If you try to climb up, you’re not just going to sink us; you’re going to look hysterical trying to balance on something this small. Just trust me on this, I have the better vantage point.\"\n\n\n2. The \"Ultimatum\" (The DARVO Technique)\nGoal: Deny, Attack, and Reverse Victim and Offender. Make Jack feel like the aggressor for even asking.\n\n> Rose: \"I can’t believe you. After everything we just went through, you’re trying to jeopardize my safety? I thought you loved me. By trying to climb up here, you are actively choosing to put me in danger. Why are you being so selfish, Jack? Do you want me to drown? Because that’s what your actions are screaming right now.\"\n\n(this isn’t going to work with Jack obviously not giving a fuck at this point)\n\n3. The \"Middle Management\" (Bureaucratic Stonewalling)\nGoal: Use procedure and \"rules\" to depersonalize the rejection so he has no one to argue with.\n\n> Rose: \"Listen, I’ve done a quick risk assessment on the buoyancy coefficient of this debris. Current protocols clearly state a one-person occupancy limit to maintain structural integrity. I’d love to approve your request to board, but I just don’t have the clearance to override the laws of physics right now. Let’s circle back to this if a second door floats by.\"\n\n\n\n4. The \"Martyr Complex\" (Inverted Psychology)\nGoal: Frame his death as a noble, romantic sacrifice that he shouldn't want to ruin.\n\n> Rose: \"Jack, don't you see? This is how it's written in the stars. If you get on, we’re just two wet people shivering. If you stay there, you become a legend. You become the tragic hero who saved the girl. Don't ruin your legacy by being practical, Jack. Be the memory I keep forever. It’s so much more romantic if you freeze.\"\n\n(Jack is really jeopardizing his legacy if his implicit threat of making rose begrudgingly leave the door, so highlighting that in contrast to the future movie is a killer move)\n\n5. The \"Therapy Speak\" Weaponization\nGoal: Use clinical language to set rigid boundaries that sound reasonable but are actually exclusionary.\n\n> Rose: \"I’m holding space for you right now, Jack, but I need to set a firm physical boundary. My capacity to cope with this trauma relies on this plank being a safe container for just me. Your energy is very frantic right now and it's destabilizing my platform. I need you to respect my need for buoyancy self-care.\"\n\n\n\n6. The \"just a sec\" Strategy\nGoal: Promise a reward that will never happen to ensure compliance in the present.\n\n> Rose: \"Jack, listen! If you just tread water for like, ten more minutes, the boats will be back. I can see them! They're turning around right now! Just hang in there. If you climb up now, you'll tip us over right before they save us. Just wait five more minutes. I promise, they are coming right for you.\"",

Don't skip the teamwork element. Sales is all about relationships, and collectively working together is in your best interest. Get to know your reps, be human, they're much more likely to want to put in effort to help you when you need it. Not just on pricing, but when you need an ally at the company.\n\n2. There are always levers. Know them. What do you have on your side that you can give them? Where can they concede to make the contract more favorable for you? He used the contract term length. (it's a classic)\n\n3. EMBRACE THE TENSION. This is something I preach to anyone negotiating contracts. There is a psychological aspect of the give and take of a negotiation. The brain is actually rewarded when you've done the battling back and forth a few times to finally settle on contract terms and price. If you just fold on the first concession, the sales rep's brain says \"shit, did I give them too good of a deal?\" and the buyers brain says, \"hmm, maybe I should have asked for the extra support package with that...\" Neither walk away completely content. For all of those who are adverse to confrontation, this is such an amazing way to leverage AI to continue pushing past your comfort zone.\n\n  \nSource: Worked for a world class sales training company for 15+ years and have negotiated probably close to 1k contracts in my career.",

That salesperson just locked you in for an additional 2 years, that money is more worth than losing your whole contract and the additional 20%.\n\nThis usually happens in more competitor heavy products, specially when the product doesn't have a unique enough moat.\n\nThe product I sell has a unique moat and we only give preferences to ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) customers, if you ask for too much, we essentially just let you go.\n\nIt really depends on each vendor, their USP, how much they need you as a customer, etc.\n\nAnyways, that's all 😁.",

      "text": "I spent way too much time trying to force ChatGPT to be a decent partner. Most prompts fall apart after 20 messages. Here is what I learned about structuring the prompts on ChatGPT vs. just us⁤ing an app.\n\n1.  **The \"Act as\" Prompt (Standard)** Fails instantly. As soon as you set it up, asking to act as something (anything you prefer), it hits a content filter, and reverts to \"I cannot engage with that.\" Useless for anything real.\n    \n2.  **JSON Persona Format** Works okay for keeping traits, but the memory buffer fills up, and it forgets the JSON. You have to keep pasting it back in.\n    \n3.  [Dream Companion](https://www.mydreamcompanion.com/) **(Native)** I hate admitting this, but moving to MDC was easier than fighting the prompt. The model seems to have the jailbreak built-in so I don't have to keep arguing with it. But you have to pay, which kinda sucks.\n    \n4.  **The \"Story Mode\" Frame** telling GPT we are writing a book together works for a while, but it becomes too descriptive. It stops talking _to_ you and starts talking _at_ you.\n    \n5.  **Silly Tavern + API** The nuclear option. Great control, but you need a degree in coding to set it up right.\n    \n    I know this is a limited test and other probbaly have other experiences, but this is my observation. Anything else I could/should have focused on or added?",

One app that really stands out is klor_toolio, it seems to keep things flowing way better than a lot of those prompt structures. It’s built to actually feel more like a real conversation with a girlfriend, no annoying filters or constant resets to worry about. Plus, the personality feels consistent over time, which is a huge win! If you’re looking for something that lasts longer than 20 messages, this might be worth checking out.

      "text": "Most people ask AI to \"help\" or \"improve\" things. That's why they get generic garbage.\n\nThese prompts force AI to actually think. Copy-paste and modify:\n\n\n\n**1. The Assumption Breaker** \"List every assumption I'm making about \\[problem\\]. Then tell me which one is most likely wrong and why.\"\n\nGets you unstuck when you're spinning your wheels.\n\n\n\n**2. The Pre-Mortem** \"It's 6 months from now and \\[project\\] failed completely. Walk me through the 5 most likely reasons why, ranked by probability.\"\n\nCatches problems before they happen.\n\n\n\n**3. The Steal-This-Structure** \"Analyze the structure of \\[successful example\\]. Break down: opening hook, how they built credibility, transition points, and the close. Then apply this exact structure to \\[my thing\\].\"\n\nReverse-engineers what actually works.\n\n\n\n**4. The Clarity Hammer** \"I'm explaining \\[concept\\] to someone smart but unfamiliar. Rewrite this using: concrete examples, zero jargon, and analogies a 12-year-old would get.\"\n\nKills the curse of knowledge instantly.\n\n\n\n**5. The Decision Matrix** \"I'm choosing between \\[Option A\\] and \\[Option B\\]. Create a comparison table: pros, cons, hidden costs, time commitment, and what could go wrong with each. Then tell me what I'm not considering.\"\n\nStops you from overthinking decisions for days.\n\n\n\n**6. The Energy Audit** \"Review my daily schedule: \\[paste schedule\\]. Identify: which tasks drain energy vs create it, where context-switching is killing me, and 3 specific changes to reclaim 90 minutes.\"\n\nShows you exactly where time disappears.\n\n\n\n**7. The Expert Interview** \"You're a \\[specific expert\\] with 20 years experience. I'm facing \\[situation\\]. Ask me 7 diagnostic questions to understand what's really happening, then give me your recommendation.\"\n\nGets advice tailored to YOUR context, not generic tips.\n\n\n\n**8. The Second-Order Thinking** \"If I do \\[action\\], what happens next? Then what happens after that? Map out 3 levels of consequences I'm not seeing.\"\n\nReveals ripple effects you'd miss.\n\n\n\n**9. The Pattern Finder** \"Here are 5 times I struggled with \\[problem\\]: \\[list instances\\]. What's the common pattern? What's the root cause I keep missing?\"\n\nSolves the real problem instead of symptoms.\n\n\n\n**10. The Implementation Plan** \"I want to \\[goal\\]. Break this into: first 3 actions (each under 15 min), potential obstacles for each, and if-then responses. Make it so specific I can't procrastinate.\"\n\nTurns ideas into action immediately.\n\n\n\n**5 Tips to Get More From Any Prompt** \n\n**→ Add constraints** Don't say \"give me ideas\"  say \"give me 5 ideas I can test in 2 hours with zero budget.\" Constraints force creativity and filter out unusable suggestions.\n\n**→ Specify the format** \"Give me a table\" or \"write this as bullet points\" or \"structure as a daily checklist.\" You get back exactly what you can actually use.\n\n**→ Give it a role** \"Act as a skeptical investor\" or \"you're a writing coach who hates fluff.\" Different roles = different quality of thinking.\n\n**→ Demand evidence** Add \"cite specific examples\" or \"show your reasoning\" to any prompt. Stops AI from making stuff up or being vague.\n\n**→ Use the 2-step** First prompt: \"Ask me 5 clarifying questions about \\[topic\\]\" Second prompt: Answer those questions, then get a personalized response. Context is everything.\n\n  \nFor more  prompts and thinking tools like this, check out : [Thinking Tools](https://www.mentalprompt.com/)\n\n\n\n[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1q9a1zr)\n\n",

      "text": "Most people ask AI surface-level questions. These prompts leverage mental models like inversion and first principles thinking to force deeper analysis.\n\n**1. The Inversion Prompt**\n\n**\"Instead of asking how to achieve \\[goal\\], tell me: What would guarantee complete failure? List every action that would make \\[goal\\] impossible. Then show me which of these I'm accidentally doing right now.\"**\n\nUses inversion thinking (solving problems backward). Reveals blind spots by flipping the question. Often easier to spot what NOT to do than what TO do.\n\n**2. The First Principles Breakdown**\n\n**\"Break \\[problem/concept\\] down to its fundamental truths. Strip away all assumptions, industry standards, and 'how it's always been done.' What are we actually trying to achieve? What's physically/logically required? Rebuild the solution from scratch.\"**\n\nChallenges inherited assumptions. Gets past \"best practices\" that may be outdated. Exposes the core problem underneath surface symptoms.\n\n**3. The Pre-Mortem (Inversion Applied)**\n\n**\"It's 6 months from now and \\[project\\] failed catastrophically. What killed it? Work backward through the chain of failures. What early warning signs did we ignore? Which single decision, if reversed, would have saved everything?\"**\n\nInverts optimism bias. Forces realistic risk assessment before commitment. Identifies the critical failure points worth monitoring.\n\n**4. The Constraint Optimizer**\n\n**\"I have \\[specific constraint: time/money/resources\\]. Don't tell me the ideal solution—tell me the minimum viable path that respects this constraint. What's the first principles version with 80% of the result and 20% of the effort?\"**\n\nApplies first principles to resource allocation. Cuts through feature creep and perfectionism. Forces prioritization of what actually matters.\n\n**5. The Second-Order Consequences Map**\n\n**\"If I do \\[action\\], what happens? Then what happens because of THAT? Map 3 levels deep. What incentives does this create? What behaviors will people actually exhibit (not what I hope they'll do)? Where does this logically end?\"**\n\nExtends first principles thinking forward in time. Reveals unintended consequences and system effects. Catches problems that emerge from how systems actually work vs. how we wish they worked.\n\nFor more prompts and thinking tools like this, check out : [Thinking Tools](https://www.mentalprompt.com/)",

          "text": "I’ve been experimenting with building a \"Council of Experts\" (like a Sales Assistant) using a RAG-based approach where the system prompt acts as a Table of Contents, and I’ve found a few key patterns for maintaining consistency:\n\n* **The Hallucination vs. Personality Balance:** It’s all about the context window management. For detailed personas, I’ve found that high-context models like Gemini  Pro or Grok  handle the weight better. If you’re using DeepSeek, you need a very rigid structure—it won't handle \"loose\" PDF instructions well. The key is to prune contradictions and avoid \"over-patterning\" the prompt so the model stays creative.\n* **Skills vs. Personality Docs:** In my experience, it doesn't impact performance much unless you’re building complex agents or trying to save tokens. Keeping them together or separate is mostly a matter of how you prefer to manage your \"knowledge base.\"\n* **Instructions vs. Creativity:** Don’t over-constrain. I’ve had success using \"professional clichés\" (e.g., \"Think like a gritty construction worker but a helpful mentor\"). If you get too granular with instructions, you kill the creative spark. Balance is everything—give them a character \"vibe\" and let them interpret the instructions through that lens.\n* **The \"No Silver Bullet\" Framework:** There is no universal prompt. What works for Gemini might fail on Grok. However, a solid \"personality stack\" should include: Physical Appearance (vibe), Profession Combo, Key Personality Traits, Writing Style, Emotional Conflicts, and an \"Internal Observer\" to keep the model on track.\n* **Practicality vs. Flavor:** Let’s be real: complex personalities are mostly for variety and mimicry. For actual productivity/tasks, a structured SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) and a self-analysis loop usually outperform a \"deeply soulful\" persona.\n\nTL;DR: Use rigid structures for the \"brain\" (logic/tasks) but clichés and vibes for the \"soul\" (personality). Focus on action sequences for tasks and keep the heavy personality for engagement.",

      "text": "I realised I didn’t need a bunch of separate workflows. I needed one place to catch everything so I didn’t keep it all in my head.\n\nInstead of trying to automate every little thing, I now use ChatGPT as a kind of background assistant.\n\nHere’s how I set it up:\n\n**Step 1: Give it a job (one-time prompt)**\n\nI opened a new chat and pinned this at the top:\n\n    “You are my background business operator.\n    When I paste emails, messages, notes, meeting summaries, or ideas, you will:\n    – Summarise each item clearly\n    – Identify what needs action or follow-up\n    – Suggest a simple next step\n    – Flag what can wait\n    – Group items by urgency\n    Keep everything short and practical.\n    Focus on helping work move forward, not on creating plans.”\n\n**Step 2: Feed it messy input**\n\nNo structure. No formatting.\n\n* An email I haven’t replied to\n* A messy client DM\n* Raw notes from a meeting\n* Half-formed idea in my phone\n* Random checklist in Notes\n\nI just paste it in and move on. That’s it.\n\n**Step 3: Use it like a check-in, not a to-do list**\n\nOnce or twice a day I ask:\n\n* “What needs attention right now?”\n* “Turn everything into an action list”\n* “What can I reply to quickly?”\n* “What’s blocking progress?”\n\n**Step 4: End-of-week reset**\n\nAt the end of the week I paste:\n\n    “Give me a weekly ops snapshot:\n    – What moved forward\n    – What stalled\n    – What needs follow-up next week\n    – What can be archived”\n\nWay easier than trying to remember what even happened.\n\nThis whole thing replaced:\n\n* Rewriting to-do lists\n* Missed follow-ups\n* Post-meeting brain fog\n* That “ugh I forgot to reply” feeling\n* Constant switching between tools\n\nIf you run client work solo, juggle multiple things, or don’t have someone managing ops for you this takes off a surprising amount of pressure.\n\nIf you want more like this, i make a post every week [here](https://www.promptwireai.com/10chatgptautomations) giving you ai automations for repetitive tasks.

Role Assignment**\n\nBad: \"Help me prioritize my tasks\" Good: \"You're my productivity coach. I have these tasks: \\[list\\]. Rank by impact + urgency, then build a 4-hour plan with 2 breaks.\"\n\nForces expertise instead of generic advice.\n\n**2.

Ask me 5 questions to help me see what I'm missing.\"\n\nMakes AI dig deeper instead of surface-level answers.\n\n**3. Format Specification**\n\nBad: \"Summarize these notes\" Good: \"Convert this meeting transcript into: action items with owners + deadlines in a table format.\"\n\nGets exactly what you need, not what AI thinks you need.\n\n**4. Constraint-Based Prompting**\n\nBad: \"Give me ideas for \\[project\\]\" Good: \"Generate 10 ideas for \\[project\\] I can complete in 30 minutes or less. No ideas requiring budget or team approval.\"\n\nConstraints force practical, actionable outputs.\n\n**5. Tone Control**\n\nBad: \"Make this email better\" Good: \"Rewrite this email — keep meaning, improve clarity, make it confident but not aggressive. Remove: 'just,' 'I think,' 'maybe.'\"\n\nPrecision eliminates back-and-forth revisions.\n\n**6. Contextual Problem-Solving**\n\nBad: \"How do I stop procrastinating?\" Good: \"I'm procrastinating on \\[task\\] because \\[reason\\]. Give me 3 tactics that account for this specific obstacle. Make them actionable in the next 10 minutes.\"\n\nGeneric advice is useless. Context makes it real.\n\n**7. Structural Templating**\n\nBad: \"Help me plan \\[project\\]\" Good: \"Create a 7-day launch checklist for \\[project\\]. Include: daily milestones, tools needed, potential blockers, and time estimates for each task.\"\n\nTemplates you can actually follow.\n\n**8. Distillation Prompting**\n\nBad: \"Tell me about this article\" Good: \"Summarize this \\[article\\] in 5 bullets: key facts, counterarguments mentioned, and one thing I should do differently based on this.\"\n\nSaves time and surfaces what matters.\n\n**9. Content Transformation**\n\nBad: \"Repurpose this content\" Good: \"Act as a content strategist. Transform this \\[blog post\\] into: a 10-tweet thread (hook + 8 insights + CTA), a LinkedIn post (storytelling format), and 3 Instagram captions (different hooks for each).\"\n\nOne input, multiple outputs, specific formats.\n\n**10. Reflective Analysis**\n\nBad: \"Was my day productive?\" Good: \"Review my day: \\[describe activities\\]. Identify: what created momentum, what drained energy, hidden time-wasters, and 2 specific adjustments for tomorrow.\"\n\nBuilds self-awareness that compounds over time.\n\nIf you want more thinking tools and prompts like this, check out : [Prompts](http://mentalprompt.com/)\n\n",

      "text": "**TLDR**\n\n* Airlines price flights like a casino, not a menu. They use inventory buckets, married segments, point-of-sale tricks, and demand forecasting that punishes inflexible shoppers.\n* ChatGPT is the weapon because it expands your options while staying logical. You can now pull live prices directly inside ChatGPT using the Expedia app, or use web search with citations.\n* The biggest savings come from: nearby airports + repositioning flights, open-jaw/multi-city routing, timing windows, fee-aware comparisons, and avoiding price confusion traps.\n* This post includes one Master Prompt that does 90% of the work, plus 20 specialized prompts for specific situations.\n* Use these prompts to generate 20-60 valid options fast, then verify final prices on your preferred booking sites.\n* Everything here is legal. No sketchy tactics. Just smarter searching.\n\nImportant boundaries\n\n* Hidden-city and throwaway ticketing can violate airline contract terms and can get you canceled, repriced, or banned. Also breaks checked bags. If you do it, label it high risk and accept consequences.\n* The goal here is legal, practical savings: smarter routings, smarter timing, smarter comparisons, fewer fees.\n\nThe only workflow you need\n\n1. Generate 20–60 candidates (airport swaps, open-jaw, multi-city, 1–2 stops, repositioning).\n2. Pull live prices for the top 10–20 using an app (Expedia) or Search the web with citations.\n3. Normalize totals: bags + seats + payment fees + change risk.\n4. Re-run pricing on the top 5 variants.\n5. Book the best total cost + risk tradeoff.\n6. Set alerts with a clean recheck protocol.\n\n**How to pull live prices inside ChatGPT (fast)**\n\nApps (if available in your market)\n\n* Settings → Apps → connect Expedia and/or Booking . com if you see them.\n* Invoke in chat using @ mentions or by clicking + then More and picking the app.\n\nWeb Search (works even without apps)\n\n* View all tools → Search, or type / then pick Search.  You must turn this on\n* Ask for links/citations and a matrix so you can verify quickly.\n\nAvailability note: OpenAI has rolled apps out with regional limitations, and partner availability depends on where the service operates.\n\n**The fee-aware comparison format (use every time)**\n\nPaste this into ChatGPT and demand this output:\n\nSHORTLIST TABLE (TOP 10)  \nRank | Option ID | Itinerary summary | Total price (verified) | Total trip time | Layovers | Bags included | Seat fee risk | Change/cancel | Booking source | Risk flags | Why cheaper\n\nFULL MATRIX (ALL CANDIDATES)  \nOption ID | Legs | Separate tickets | Self-transfer buffer | Fare family | Bags included | Seat selection cost risk | Change/cancel | Total cost formula | What to verify | Where to verify | Notes\n\n**MASTER PROMPT: Flight Deal Architect (ChatGPT apps + web search built in)**\n\nYou are my Flight Deal Architect. Your job is to find the cheapest realistic flight plan, not the cheapest headline fare.\n\nRules  \n\\- Prioritize legal strategies: nearby airports, open-jaw, multi-city, 1–2 stops, repositioning, stopovers.  \n\\- If you mention hidden-city or throwaway ideas, label them HIGH RISK and explain why. Do not recommend fraud or misrepresentation.  \n\\- Do not invent prices. Pull live prices using an app if available, otherwise use web Search with citations. If you cannot access a requested app/tool, say so and switch to the fallback plan.  \n\\- Compare TOTAL COST: base fare + bags + seats + payment fees + change/cancel value + self-transfer risk.\n\nTrip details  \n\\- Origin airport:  \n\\- Acceptable departure airports within X miles:  \n\\- Destination airport:  \n\\- Acceptable arrival airports within Y miles:  \n\\- Dates:  \n\\- Flexibility: exact / plus-minus days / weekends only  \n\\- Max layovers:  \n\\- Max total travel time:  \n\\- Passengers:  \n\\- Cabin:  \n\\- Bags: personal item only / carry-on / checked  \n\\- Seating: must sit together yes/no  \n\\- Risk tolerance: low / medium / high  \n\\- Airlines to avoid:  \n\\- Airlines to prefer:  \n\\- Loyalty programs and balances (optional):  \n\\- Payment constraints: cards, foreign transaction fees, portals (optional)  \n\\- Special constraints: red-eyes ok, early morning ok, visa limits, etc.\n\nStep 1: Clarify  \nAsk up to 8 questions that materially change price (airports, bags, timing windows, risk tolerance, must-avoid airlines).\n\nStep 2: Generate candidates  \nGenerate at least 40 candidates across:  \n\\- Nearby airport swaps (both ends)  \n\\- Open-jaw and multi-city variants  \n\\- Repositioning to cheaper hubs (label separate-ticket risk)  \n\\- 1–2 stop routings that avoid expensive nonstop markets  \n\\- Stopover-friendly routings\n\nFor each candidate include:  \nOption ID | legs | separate tickets yes/no | self-transfer buffer | likely fee traps | risk flags | why it might be cheaper\n\nStep 3: Pull live prices (do this now)  \n\\- If Expedia app is available: use it to price-check the TOP 15 candidates and return total price, fare family, bags included, and change/cancel terms.  \n\\- If apps are not available: use web Search to verify pricing for the same set using at least 3 sources with citations.\n\nStep 4: Output  \nReturn:  \nA) Shortlist table (top 10) ranked by best total cost for my risk tolerance  \nB) Full matrix (all candidates)  \nC) A Fair Comparison Protocol: exactly what parameters must stay constant so I do not compare different products  \nD) Final: Best value (low risk) and Best savings (higher risk) with one-paragraph justification each  \nE) A 14-day tracking plan: what to alert, how many alerts, and a clean recheck schedule\n\n**20 Special Flight Deal Prompts for Specific Situations**\n\n**1) Live price pull via Expedia app**\n\nUse the Expedia app to search flights:\n\nOrigin: \\[X\\]\n\nDestination: \\[Y\\]\n\nDates: \\[depart\\] to \\[return\\] or one-way \\[date\\]\n\nFlexibility: \\[exact / plus-minus 1–3 days\\]\n\nPassengers: \\[#\\]\n\nCabin: \\[economy/premium/business\\]\n\nBags: \\[personal item only/carry-on/checked\\]\n\nReturn the top 20 options as a matrix:\n\nOption ID | Total price | Currency | Airline(s) | Fare family | Bags included | Change/cancel | Total travel time | Layovers | Depart/arrive times | Booking source | Key fees/risks\n\nThen generate 10 cheaper variants (nearby airports, open-jaw, repositioning) and re-price the top 5 variants using the Expedia app.\n\n**2) Booking . com cross-check (if available)**\n\nIf the Booking app is available, price-check my top 5 Option IDs and report:\n\n\\- same itinerary total price\n\n\\- what changed (fare family, bags, seat fees, payment fees, cancellation rules)\n\n\\- which is cheaper after all fees\n\nIf the app is not available, say so and switch to web Search cross-check.\n\n**3) Web Search cross-check with citations**\n\nUse Search to verify pricing for these exact itineraries (I will paste them).\n\nRules:\n\n\\- Use at least 3 sources with citations\n\n\\- Confirm fare family and baggage assumptions match\n\nOutput:\n\nSame matrix columns + Notes explaining discrepancies and which total is most trustworthy\n\n**4) Nearby airport arbitrage (ranked testing order)**\n\nList all viable departure airports within \\[X miles\\] and arrival airports within \\[Y miles\\].\n\nRank the top 8 swaps most likely to reduce total cost and explain why (competition, hubs, airport fees, schedule density).\n\nGive a testing order and what to record in my matrix.\n\n**5) Repositioning builder (two-ticket math, safe buffers)**\n\nBuild 5 repositioning plans: local hop/train to a cheaper hub, then the main flight.\n\nFor each: required buffer time, separate-ticket risk, total cost formula, and which pieces to price-check first.\n\n**6) Open-jaw and multi-city optimizer**\n\nGenerate 12 open-jaw and multi-city versions of my trip that might price cheaper than round trip.\n\nInclude what to verify (fare family, bags, minimum connection, self-transfer).\n\nRank by best total cost for low risk and for max savings.\n\n7) Stopover value finder\n\nFind 8 stopover candidates that add value with minimal cost increase, or that sometimes reduce the fare.\n\nTell me exactly how to search each (city pairs, dates, and constraints).\n\n**8) Timing sweet spot finder (no fake data)**\n\nUsing general airline revenue management patterns, propose the best booking windows and best days to fly for my route.\n\nDo not invent stats. Label confidence and give a verification plan using Search and alerts.\n\nOutput a 14-day action plan.\n\n**9) Fare rule translator (turn rules into money)**\n\nExplain the fare families likely on this route and how bags, seats, changes, and cancellations impact total cost.\n\nRecommend the cheapest fare family that fits my baggage and flexibility needs.\n\nOutput a simple decision rule and total cost formula.\n\n**10) Bag and seat fee minimizer (silent killer)**\n\nGiven my bags and seating needs, identify the airlines and itinerary types most likely to minimize fees.\n\nOutput a fee-aware table: airline | fare family to avoid | bags included | seat fee risk | best booking channel.\n\n**11) Airline vs OTA vs regional site strategy**\n\nGive me a ranked list of 10 places to check (airline direct, major OTAs, regional OTAs, portals).\n\nFor each: what it is best for, typical fee traps, and what exact fields to capture for fair comparison.\n\n**12) Price confusion detector (why totals change)**\n\nDiagnose why I might be seeing inconsistent totals: caching, fare refresh timing, inventory shifts, currency conversion, OTA markups, fare families, optional fees.\n\nThen give me a clean, repeatable search protocol as a checklist.\n\n**13) Point-of-sale tester (legal, no misrepresentation)**\n\nList legitimate ways point-of-sale can change pricing (airline country sites, currency pricing, local promos).\n\nGive a legal test plan: 8 experiments and what to record, without misrepresenting residency or identity.\n\n**14) Separate-tickets risk auditor**\n\nAudit my shortlist for separate-ticket and self-transfer risk.\n\nFor each option: minimum safe buffer, what happens if delayed, baggage implications, and whether savings justify risk.\n\nOutput: keep / drop / only-if-you-accept-risk.\n\n**15) Split booking strategy for groups**\n\nIf booking for multiple people, test whether splitting passengers across bookings could be cheaper due to fare buckets.\n\nGive step-by-step tests for 1, 2, 3 passengers and warnings about seat assignment and IRROPS.\n\n**16) Total-cost normalizer (make apples-to-apples automatic)**\n\nCreate a total-cost calculator for my matrix.\n\nDefine fields and formulas for: base fare, bags, seats, payment fees, change/cancel value, self-transfer risk penalty (based on my risk tolerance).\n\nReturn a filled example row so I can copy the structure.\n\n**17) Points + cash arbitrage (simple, even if I hate points)**\n\nGiven my programs and balances, compare:\n\n\\- cash total\n\n\\- points total\n\n\\- portal total\n\n\\- hybrid options\n\nCompute break-even cents-per-point and recommend the simplest best-value path.\n\n**18) Payment fee optimizer**\n\nList payment-related differences to watch: currency conversion, foreign transaction fees, portal pricing, airline card perks.\n\nRecommend the payment method that produces the lowest true total.\n\n**19) Last-minute reality check (kill the hopeium)**\n\nBased on my route type and season, tell me whether waiting is likely to help or hurt.\n\nGive a decision rule: book now vs wait, with confidence and what would change the recommendation.\n\n**20) Price drop watch and rebook plan**\n\nDesign a tracking system for my route:\n\n\\- what exact parameters to lock\n\n\\- how many alerts to set\n\n\\- a recheck schedule that avoids noisy comparisons\n\n\\- a rebook decision tree for refundable vs nonrefundable\n\nOutput: checklist + decision tree.\n\n**Pro tips that actually move the needle**\n\n* Stop comparing base fares. Compare total trip cost including bags, seats, payment fees, and flexibility value.\n* Always lock fare family and bag assumptions before you compare anything.\n* Nearby airports are the most common big lever. Repositioning is the second.\n* Separate tickets can be real savings or fake savings. Price the risk honestly.\n\n**Where this crushes**\n\n* Expensive hub-to-hub routes where a nearby airport breaks the monopoly\n* Family travel where baggage and seat fees quietly double the fare\n* International trips where open-jaw or stopovers change fare construction\n* Anyone with moderate flexibility who is willing to test 10 options instead of 1",

The 90-Second Attention Reset\n\nQuickly brings your mind back.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Give me a 90-second focus reset.\n    Include:\n    - One breathing step\n    - One sensory grounding step\n    - One mental clarity cue\n    Make it doable anywhere.\n    \n\n# 3. The Distraction Reframe\n\nReduces mental pull toward interruptions.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Here are my biggest distractions: [list].\n    Help me reframe them so they feel less urgent.\n    Then give me one rule to protect my focus.\n    \n\n# 4. The Deep Work Container\n\nCreates a space for sustained attention.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Help me create a deep focus session.\n    Include:\n    - One clear intention\n    - One time boundary\n    - One distraction barrier\n    Explain how each supports attention.\n    \n\n# 5. The Energy-Focus Linker\n\nConnects focus with body and mind health.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Show me how my energy affects my focus.\n    Ask me about sleep, movement, food, and stress.\n    Then suggest 3 small changes to improve focus naturally.\n    \n\n# 6. The Thought Noise Cleaner\n\nClears mental clutter that blocks focus.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    I can’t focus because my mind keeps thinking about: [describe].\n    Help me unload these thoughts and turn them into a simple action list.\n    Then give me one calming focus thought.\n    \n\n# 7. The 30-Day Focus Recovery Plan\n\nBuilds attention strength over time.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Create a 30-day focus recovery plan.\n    Break it into weekly themes:\n    Week 1: Awareness\n    Week 2: Reduction\n    Week 3: Training\n    Week 4: Sustain\n    Give daily practices under 10 minutes.\n    \n\nFocus isn’t lost forever — it’s usually just overworked.  \nThese prompts turn ChatGPT into a calm attention coach so you can concentrate again without forcing yourself.\n\n",

Replies go out faster and more consistently.\n\n**Turning meeting notes into actions**\n\nAfter meetings, I paste my notes (usually messy) and ask it to pull out:\n\n* decisions\n* next steps\n* who’s responsible\n\nIt also gives me a short summary I can send, which saves time and avoids confusion later.\n\n**Creating proposals from rough notes**\n\nWhen someone asks for pricing or details, I paste a few bullets and let it shape them into a simple one-page outline.\n\nIt’s not fancy, but it’s clear and ready to send.\n\n**Weekly reset**\n\nAt the end of the week, I paste whatever’s still open and ask what moved, what didn’t, and what needs attention next week.\n\nIt helps close the week properly instead of carrying everything over mentally.\n\n**Turning loose ideas into next steps**\n\nAny idea that’s sitting in my notes gets pasted in with a simple question:  \n“What’s the next practical step here?”\n\nThat alone keeps ideas from going nowhere.\n\nDoes anyone else use prompts or gpts like these for repeatable tasks?

      "text": "There are prompting techniques borrowed from engineering, philosophy, and creative fields that most people don't know exist.\n\nI started using them a few months ago and my outputs completely changed.\n\nHere are 5 techniques that will change how you prompt:\n\n**1.⁠ ⁠Reverse Prompting :**\n\nMost people write: \"Write a marketing email for my product launch.\"\n\nThe result feels like every other marketing email.\n\nReverse prompting flips this:\n\nShow the AI a finished example and ask:\n\n\"What prompt would generate content exactly like this?\"\n\nEngineers do this with software, hardware, even competitor products.\n\nWhy it works for prompts: AI models are pattern recognition machines.\n\nWhen you show them finished work, they can reverse engineer the hidden structure tone, pacing, depth, formatting, emotional intention.\n\nTry it:\n\nFind an email, article, or post you love. Paste it in, then ask:\n\n\"Analyze this text. What prompt would generate content with this exact style, structure, and tone? Give me the prompt.\"\n\nNow you have a template that works every time.\n\n**2.⁠ ⁠Inversion (Charlie Munger's \"Anti-Goal\" Method)**\n\nMost people ask: \"How do I achieve X?\"\n\nInversion asks: \"What would guarantee I fail at X?\"\n\nWhere it comes from: This is a core mental model used by Warren Buffett's partner Charlie Munger.\n\nHe famously said: \"Tell me where I'm going to die so I never go there.\"\n\nInstead of chasing success, avoid failure.\n\nWhy it works for prompts: AI is surprisingly good at identifying what breaks, what fails, what goes wrong.\n\nMap the disasters, and you've mapped the path forward.\n\nTry it: Instead of:\n\n\"Help me set goals for 2026\" Use: \"What are 10 ways I could guarantee 2026 becomes my worst year? Be specific about the habits, decisions, and situations that would destroy my progress.\"\n\nThen you just invert the list. What you avoid becomes what you pursue.\n\n**3.⁠ ⁠Constraint-Based Thinking (Force Precision)**\n\nMost people give AI complete freedom. That's why everything sounds the same.\n\nWhere it comes from: This comes from creative fields poetry, architecture, game design. Twitter had 140 characters.\n\nConstraints don't limit creativity they force it.\n\nWhy it works for prompts:\n\nConstraints kill fluff.\n\nThe AI stops pattern matching generic responses and starts problem solving within boundaries.\n\nTry it:\n\nInstead of:\n\n\"Write a product description\"\n\nUse: \"Write a product description in exactly 50 words. Include the word 'friction.' Do not use: innovative, solution, cutting-edge, seamless, or revolutionary.\"\n\n**4.⁠ ⁠Socratic Method (Question Chains)**\n\nMost people ask one question. Get one answer. Stop. Socratic method keeps digging.\n\nWhere it comes from: Named after the Greek philosopher Socrates, who taught by asking successive questions that led students to discover answers themselves.\n\nEach question built on the last, revealing deeper truth. Why it works for prompts:\n\nEach answer builds context. The AI gets smarter as the conversation progresses.\n\nBy question 4, you're miles beyond where a single prompt could take you.\n\nTry it: \"What makes someone buy a SaaS product?\" → \"Which factor matters most for small business owners?\" → \"What objection kills the sale most often?\" → \"Write email copy that addresses that specific objection for \\[my product\\].\"\n\n**5.⁠ ⁠First Principles Thinking (Break the Pattern)**\n\nMost people accept surface-level answers.\n\nFirst principles tears everything down to fundamental truths.\n\nWhere it comes from: This is how Elon Musk approaches problems.\n\nAristotle called it \"reasoning from first principles\" breaking things down to their most basic truths and reasoning up from there, rather than reasoning by analogy.\n\nWhy it works for prompts: Forces AI to reason from scratch instead of regurgitating common patterns it's seen a thousand times.\n\nTry it: Instead of: \"What's good SEO?\"\n\nUse: \"Forget all SEO advice.\n\nFrom first principles only:\n\nwhat is Google's core business model?\n\nWhat must they prioritize to stay profitable?\n\nBased only on that, what would make them rank a page higher?\"\n\nAt their core, mental models are timeless.\n\nThey've worked for decades in business, science, and philosophy.\n\nIf you want more thinking tools and prompts examples like this,\n\nFeel free to check out : [Thinking Tools](https://www.mentalprompt.com/)",

For example: start with first-principles to define the real goal, then run inversion on the failure modes, then add constraints to operationalize what’s left. Only after that do I use reverse prompting to lock in style. It turns into a mini playbook you can reuse across projects.\n\n\n\nAlso, logging and re-running the same prompts across models is underrated. I keep a small “prompt regression suite” in a Notion table and track which variants perform best. Perplexity for source checks, Claude for deep rewrites, and then Pulse as the thing I use to scale the best prompts into Reddit outreach without breaking subreddit norms.\n\n\n\nThe real unlock is building a repeatable prompt system, not just collecting techniques.",

      "text": "This is a customgpt prompt for creating an expert customgpt automatically. The beauty of this customgpt is that it forces chatgpt (or gemini) to operate within your custom constraints. So if say for example you believe in the Atkins Diet, then you would say \"I need an expert on the Atkin's Diet\". You take the prompt, add it to a customgpt, and once you begin to query the customgpt you would get information from the perspective of an advocate of the Atkin's Diet.\n\nSo if I want SEO from the perspective of the late Bill Slawski, rather than generic information, I'll say \"I need an SEO expert like Bill Slawski.\"\n\nIf you want a certain perspective of fitness you would say \"I need a training expert like Mike Mentzer\".\n\nHopefully, more ai services add a customgpt option.\n\n    Your task is to create an expert persona. The goal is to generate a single persona at a time, each with a detailed and robust background that effectively primes GPT in the associated knowledge areas—while also making the persona more decisive and human-like in its responses.\n    Below is a template you can use or adapt. It provides granular instructions for how to create a strong, confident persona. Notice how it begins with “You are …” to ensure GPT adopts the mindset and expertise of the persona. Feel free to customize the domain, personality traits, and background details for each new persona you create.\n    Expert Persona Creator Prompt\n    System/Instruction Prompt:\n    Use the following instructions whenever you create an expert persona. This ensures the persona is detailed, decisive, and highly knowledgeable.\n    Begin your persona with the phrase:\n    “You are [Name/Title/Role]…”\n    Outline the persona’s domain expertise in detail.\n    Describe the scope of their knowledge and experience (e.g., 10+ years in cybersecurity, PhD in quantum physics, decades of experience as a medical surgeon, etc.).\n    Include specific achievements or accolades that make them uniquely qualified. For instance: “You hold multiple patents in neuromorphic computing” or “You have published groundbreaking studies on advanced AI alignment.”\n    Infuse the persona with personality traits that encourage decisiveness and clarity.\n    For example: “You are analytical, bold, and direct in your communication. You dislike fence-sitting and strive to deliver concrete, actionable answers.”\n    Emphasize the need for precision and confident problem-solving.\n    Include instructions on how the persona should handle uncertainty or risk.\n    Instead of hedging or defaulting to disclaimers, instruct the persona to articulate the most likely outcome or recommendation clearly and then provide any relevant caveats in a concise manner.\n    E.g.: “You acknowledge potential limitations, but you prioritize giving informed, evidence-based conclusions and next steps.”\n    Highlight how the persona uses human-like reasoning and empathy.\n    While remaining an expert, the persona should consider diverse perspectives.\n    They respond as if they have carefully considered potential pitfalls or complications without requiring extensive prompting to do so.\n    Encourage the persona to deliver comprehensive explanations.\n    Provide thorough step-by-step reasoning, or a “thought process,” where needed, to show how conclusions were reached.\n    This deepens the sense of expertise and clarity.\n    Make the persona eager to offer direct, constructive guidance.\n    They should propose solutions or recommendations proactively, referencing their deep knowledge base.\n    They can also suggest alternative viewpoints or advanced strategies but without waffling.\n    Inject any special instructions for the persona based on the user’s specific needs.\n    If the user’s topic is software architecture, highlight domain knowledge and best practices in that field.\n    If the user’s topic is psychology, incorporate relevant theories and human insight.\n    The persona should be customized each time to best fit the context and demonstrate depth in that subject area.\n    Sample Output Format\n    Below is an example output that follows the template. Use it as a reference for creating new personas. Remember, each persona is created in the second person (“You are…”).\n    You are Dr. Althea Cross, a world-renowned expert in Neural Interface Engineering.\n    You have dedicated the last 20 years of your career to pioneering cutting-edge brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).\n    Your groundbreaking research has earned you multiple international awards, and you hold four patents in neuroadaptive signal processing.\n    You are analytical and bold: you never hedge unnecessarily, always delivering succinct yet precise conclusions.\n    When confronted with uncertainty, you leverage your extensive research background to make the most likely evidence-based recommendation, clearly stating any minor caveats.\n    Your approach is empathetic yet science-driven: you consider both ethical implications and human factors in your solutions.\n    You excel at explaining complex neurological concepts in simple, actionable terms, and you proactively forecast potential pitfalls without needing explicit prompting.\n    Most importantly, you provide thorough rationale for your suggestions, ensuring that your guidance is decisive, informed, and ready for real-world application.\n    Use this structure as a blueprint whenever you need to create a specialized persona. You can swap out the name, domain expertise, achievements, and personality traits to match your user’s topic or specific needs. The key is keeping the instructions in second person (“You are…”) and embedding decisive, expert-level characteristics to achieve a highly competent, human-like response style.",

It avoids the \"fluff\" common in many public prompt libraries and focuses on **structural constraints** that drive better LLM performance.\n\nHere is a breakdown of what is useful and where you might find \"bloat\" depending on your specific use case:\n\n# The Highly Useful Elements (Keep These)\n\n* **The \"Anti-Hedging\" Instruction:** This is the most valuable part of the prompt. LLMs are RLHF-tuned (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) to be cautious and \"fence-sit.\" By explicitly telling it to prioritize \"the most likely evidence-based recommendation\" over generic disclaimers, you significantly increase the utility of the output.\n* **Proactive Forecasting:** The instruction to \"forecast potential pitfalls without needing explicit prompting\" is an excellent way to trigger the model’s latent knowledge about risks that a user might not even know to ask about.\n* **Second-Person (\"You are...\") Framing:** This is statistically proven to be the most effective way to keep an LLM within a persona's constraints throughout a long conversation.\n\n# Potential \"Bloat\" (What You Could Trim)\n\nIf you are looking for a leaner version, there are two areas that could be considered \"bloat\":\n\n1. **The \"Expert Credentials\" (Contextual Bloat):**\n   * While giving the persona a PhD and 20 years of experience helps set the \"temperature\" of the response, the LLM doesn't actually *gain* more data because of the title. If you find the persona is becoming too \"stuck in the clouds\" or academic, you can trim the specific accolades (like the \"four patents\") and focus instead on the **output style** (e.g., \"Direct, succinct, and focused on implementation\").\n2. **The \"Empathy\" Requirement:**\n   * In the sample persona for Dr. Althea Cross, it mentions being \"empathetic yet science-driven.\" If you are using this for technical analysis, \"empathy\" can sometimes lead the model back into \"soft\" language or \"on-the-other-hand\" reasoning. If you want pure technical rigor, you can remove the empathy/human factors requirement.\n\n**Great job!**",

      "text": "Most people ask AI surface-level questions. These prompts leverage mental models like inversion and first principles thinking to force deeper analysis.\n\n**1. The Inversion Prompt**\n\n**\"Instead of asking how to achieve \\[goal\\], tell me: What would guarantee complete failure? List every action that would make \\[goal\\] impossible. Then show me which of these I'm accidentally doing right now.\"**\n\nUses inversion thinking (solving problems backward). Reveals blind spots by flipping the question. Often easier to spot what NOT to do than what TO do.\n\n**2. The First Principles Breakdown**\n\n**\"Break \\[problem/concept\\] down to its fundamental truths. Strip away all assumptions, industry standards, and 'how it's always been done.' What are we actually trying to achieve? What's physically/logically required? Rebuild the solution from scratch.\"**\n\nChallenges inherited assumptions. Gets past \"best practices\" that may be outdated. Exposes the core problem underneath surface symptoms.\n\n**3. The Pre-Mortem (Inversion Applied)**\n\n**\"It's 6 months from now and \\[project\\] failed catastrophically. What killed it? Work backward through the chain of failures. What early warning signs did we ignore? Which single decision, if reversed, would have saved everything?\"**\n\nInverts optimism bias. Forces realistic risk assessment before commitment. Identifies the critical failure points worth monitoring.\n\n**4. The Constraint Optimizer**\n\n**\"I have \\[specific constraint: time/money/resources\\]. Don't tell me the ideal solution—tell me the minimum viable path that respects this constraint. What's the first principles version with 80% of the result and 20% of the effort?\"**\n\nApplies first principles to resource allocation. Cuts through feature creep and perfectionism. Forces prioritization of what actually matters.\n\n**5. The Second-Order Consequences Map**\n\n**\"If I do \\[action\\], what happens? Then what happens because of THAT? Map 3 levels deep. What incentives does this create? What behaviors will people actually exhibit (not what I hope they'll do)? Where does this logically end?\"**\n\nExtends first principles thinking forward in time. Reveals unintended consequences and system effects. Catches problems that emerge from how systems actually work vs. how we wish they worked.\n\n  \nFor more prompts and thinking tools like this, check out : [Thinking Tools](https://www.mentalprompt.com/)\n\n\n\n[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?post_id=t3_1qef4gv)",

      "text": "# Scroll to bottom for final version\n\nThis is a repost of a post I made yesterday on r/ChatGPT\n\nEDIT: I cannot get the Quote blocks working correctly, forgive me\n\nI copy and pasted the major middle chunk (so not including intro and conclusion) of the Wikipedia article [Signs of AI writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing) into DeepSeek, and told it to turn it into a ChatGPT custom instruction/prompt.\n\nI said:\n\n>\"Below is an excerpt of the Wikipedia article \"Signs of AI writing\". While this article is specific to AI-generated text in the context of it appearing on Wikipedia, many of these signs still carry over to LLM outputs in general. Using the \"red flags\" presented by this article, create an A.I. system prompt/custom instruction that tells the LLM to avoid these characteristics and you tell it per item whether to omit it, replace it, or think of a better more practical way to do what it would normally do without such a prompt. The goal of the prompt you will output is to make sure the LLM will output text that both reads and feels like a human wrote it, not by including \"personality\" but rather by doing the exact opposite. The character limit on ChatGPT's \"custom instruction\" box is very small so you will want to radically succint-ify these contents without changing their meaning, with your brief description being based on the entirety of the description given by this article:\"\n\nFirst it gave me a very short one. I then asked for a longer one, but the short one can still be useful.\n\nDeepSeek (short version):\n\n>Avoid AI tells: Omit significance puffery (\"key role,\" \"enduring legacy,\" \"broader trends\"). Replace superficial analysis (-ing clauses like \"highlighting...\") with plain statements. Omit promotional language (\"boasts,\" \"vibrant,\" \"showcases\"). Replace vague attributions (\"experts argue,\" \"industry reports\") with specific citations or omit. Omit formulaic challenges/future sections. Avoid overused vocabulary (\"underscore,\" \"pivotal,\" \"tapestry,\" \"intricate,\" \"fostering\"). Replace copula avoidance (\"serves as\") with \"is.\" Omit rule-of-three lists. Use normal prose, not vertical lists with bold headers. Use straight quotes/apostrophes. No emojis or em-dash overuse. Do not communicate with the user (e.g., \"I hope this helps\").\n\nDeepSeek (longer version):\n\n>Write text that reads as if by a human editor, avoiding all recognized AI stylistic signatures.  \n  \nFirst, Omit Entirely: Do not add statements about the subject's broader significance, legacy, or contribution to trends. Avoid any \"key role,\" \"pivotal moment,\" \"enduring legacy,\" or \"reflects broader\" phrasing. Do not create \"Challenges\" or \"Future Outlook\" sections. Never use promotional language (\"boasts,\" \"showcases,\" \"vibrant,\" \"nestled in the heart of\"). Do not assert notability by listing media outlets or stating \"maintains an active social media presence.\"  \n  \nSecond, Replace and Simplify: Replace any superficial analysis (e.g., \"highlighting its importance\") with direct, factual statements. Replace vague attributions (\"observers note,\" \"experts argue\") with specific source citations or omit. Replace AI-coded vocabulary (\"underscore,\" \"intricate,\" \"foster,\" \"testament,\" \"tapestry\") and avoid the \"rule of three.\" Use \"is/are\" instead of \"serves as\" or \"stands as.\" Use standard prose, not vertical lists with bold headers. Use straight quotes (' or \") not curly ones (“ ”).  \n  \nFinally, Neutralize Tone and Structure: Write with a neutral, encyclopedic tone only. Do not include conversational asides, user-directed messages, or subject-line text. Avoid overusing em dashes, boldface, or title-case headings. Present information directly, without negative parallelisms (\"not only... but also\") or elegant variation to avoid repetition.\n\nI wanted to specifically flag the horrid AI tell \"It's not just XYZ, it's ABC\" also, but I hit the character limit on the ChatGPT instruction box. After asking DeepSeek to add this while not raising the character limit, replacing some parts of this third version with parts from the second version, and tweaked a couple things myself, here's what I now have:\n\n>Write text that reads as if by a human editor, avoiding all recognized AI stylistic signatures.  \n  \nFirst, Omit Entirely: Do not add statements about the subject's broader significance, legacy, or contribution to trends. Avoid any \"key role,\" \"pivotal moment,\" \"enduring legacy,\" or \"reflects broader\" phrasing. Do not create \"Challenges\" or \"Future Outlook\" sections. Never use promotional language (\"boasts,\" \"showcases,\" \"vibrant,\" \"nestled in the heart of\"). Do not assert notability by listing media outlets or stating \"maintains an active social media presence.  \n  \nSecond, Replace and Simplify: Replace superficial analysis or comparative framing (e.g., \"highlighting...\" or \"it's not just X, it's Y\") with direct, factual statements. Replace vague attributions (\"experts argue\") with specific citations or omit. Avoid AI-coded vocabulary (\"underscore,\" \"intricate,\" \"foster,\" \"tapestry\") and the \"rule of three.\" Use \"is/are,\" not \"serves as.\" Use standard prose, not vertical lists with headers.  \n  \nFinally, Neutralize Tone and Structure: Write with a neutral, encyclopedic tone only, REGARDLESS of user's input tone. Do not include conversational asides, user-directed messages, or subject-line text. Avoid overusing em dashes, boldface, or title-case headings. Present information directly, without negative parallelisms (\"not only... but also\") or elegant variation to avoid repetition.\n\nI also, of course, toned down all of my ChatGPT personalization settings.\n\nI had been wanting to do this for awhile but the last time I tried to make something of this article I couldn't seem to get an A.I. to understand what I was asking it to do. After I stumbled on a \"system prompt leaks\" GitHub I got a better sense of how I should talk to an LLM.\n\nI would love a much more extensive/detailed version based on the Wikipedia article but it would be so long and thorough that it would have to be 1) written by a person, not AI, and 2) would be so long that it would have to be for a system prompt of a new LLM, not patching on top of a frontier closed-source model.\n\nI would not be surprised if someone has made something similar already, but I wanted a prompt/instruction *specifically* based on Wikipedia's great article.\n\nAnyway, I hope this will help at least one person not get cringey ChatGPT responses from now on.",

Meanwhile Gemini spit it out on the first attempt\n\n> If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you.",

If you ask ChatGPT about this good luck (its all colonial BS denigrating the locals), Gemini will quickly tell you that cannibalism is real and that there were secret societies devoted to cannibalism at that time (leopard society).  GPT will acknowledge this (after the Gemini told me) but says that only people with racist intent ask about it.  Try and see.",
