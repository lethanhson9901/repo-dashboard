      "text": "I used to leave work tired even on easy days.\n\nNot because the work was hard. Because everything took longer than it should.\n\nNow I keep a small set of prompts that help me finish faster and sound more put together.\n\nHere are 7 I actually use at work.\n\n# 1. The Clear Task Breakdown\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Break this task into the smallest possible steps.\n    Order them so I can finish fast.\n    Skip anything optional.\n    Task: [paste task]\n\n💡 **Example:** Turned a vague request into a simple checklist I could follow.\n\nBy the way,  I keep prompts like these saved so I do not repeat thinking every day at [AISuperHub](https://www.aisuperhub.io/prompt-hub)\n\n# 2. The Fast Decision Helper\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    I need to decide between these options.\n    List pros and cons briefly.\n    Then tell me which option makes sense and why.\n    Options: [list options]\n\n💡 **Example:** Helped me decide quickly instead of overthinking.\n\n# 3. The Email Reply Shortcut\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Write a short, clear reply to this email.\n    Keep it polite and direct.\n    Do not add extra explanation.\n    Email: [paste email]\n\n💡 **Example:** Replied in minutes instead of rewriting drafts.\n\n# 4. The Meeting Prep Prompt\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    I have a meeting about [topic].\n    Give me:\n    1. Three talking points\n    2. One smart question to ask\n    3. One risk to mention if needed\n\n💡 **Example:** Walked into meetings prepared without stress.\n\n# 5. The Manager Update Prompt\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Turn this into a clear status update for my manager.\n    Use short sentences.\n    Focus on progress, blockers, and next steps.\n    Text: [paste notes]\n\n💡 **Example:** Made updates easy and professional.\n\n# 6. The Problem Framer\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Help me explain this problem clearly at work.\n    Structure it as:\n    1. What is happening\n    2. Why it matters\n    3. What I suggest we do\n    Problem: [describe issue]\n\n💡 **Example:** Helped me speak up without rambling.\n\n# 7. The Time Saver Review\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Look at this work.\n    Tell me what can be simplified or removed.\n    Only suggest changes that save time.\n    Content: [paste content]\n\n💡 **Example:** Cut unnecessary work before submitting.\n\nWork feels lighter when things are clear.",

      "text": "Your charts are boring people to sleep\n\nMost charts fail for the same reason: they answer no real question.\n\nThey show data… but they don’t reveal a decision.\n\nWhat you actually want is this:\n\n* One chart = one question\n* One chart = one takeaway\n* One chart = one action\n\nAnd yes, ChatGPT can help you get there in minutes.\n\nBut only if you stop prompting like this:  \nMake a chart of my data\n\n…and start prompting like this:  \nHere’s the decision this chart needs to enable. Here’s the audience. Here’s what counts as a good chart. Now build and critique it until it’s obvious.\n\nThat’s how you go from boring to boardroom.\n\n**The ChatGPT prompt that turns spreadsheets into stunning charts that are actually useful**\n\n**The 60-second workflow**\n\n1. Go to chatgpt\n2. Click the + icon\n3. Upload your CSV / Excel\n4. Use a real visualization brief (template below)\n5. Ask for 3–5 chart options, not one\n6. Pick the best, then iterate: simplify, annotate, and validate\n\nThe win is not speed. The win is iteration quality.\n\n**Top use cases where ChatGPT is unfairly good**\n\nUse these when you want a real outcome, not a pretty graphic.\n\n**1) Executive summary charts**\n\n* One KPI over time with a clear story\n* Before/after of an initiative\n* Waterfall showing drivers of change\n\nAsk for: one headline, one takeaway, one recommendation.\n\n**2) Finding the story inside the data**\n\n* What changed, when, and why\n* What segment is driving results\n* What’s an outlier vs a trend\n\nAsk for: anomalies, regime changes, and breakpoints.\n\n**3) Cohorts and retention**\n\n* Cohort heatmaps\n* Retention curves\n* LTV curves by cohort or channel\n\nAsk for: where drop-offs happen and what action to take.\n\n**4) Marketing performance**\n\n* Channel ROAS vs CAC vs payback\n* Funnel conversion by segment\n* Creative performance distribution\n\nAsk for: budget reallocation recommendation based on constraints.\n\n**5) Product analytics**\n\n* Feature adoption over time\n* Activation vs retention correlation\n* Aha moment analysis\n\nAsk for: which event predicts retention and how to test it.\n\n**6) Finance and forecasting**\n\n* Actuals vs forecast with error bands\n* Scenario charts (base, upside, downside)\n* Driver-based model visuals\n\nAsk for: assumptions table + sensitivity charts.\n\n**7) Ops and process improvement**\n\n* Cycle time distributions\n* Bottleneck heatmaps\n* Control charts for stability\n\nAsk for: where variance comes from, not just averages.\n\n**The chart types ChatGPT can create (and when to use them)**\n\nForget the long list. Most people only need these:\n\n* Line: trends over time (default for time series)\n* Bar/Column: comparisons (rankings, changes)\n* Histogram: distributions (how spread out things are)\n* Scatter: relationships (does X drive Y)\n* Box plot: distribution comparisons by group\n* Heatmap: patterns across two dimensions\n* Waterfall: what caused a change\n* Small multiples: same chart repeated across segments\n\nSecret: ask ChatGPT to choose the chart type, justify it, and propose 2 alternatives.\n\n**The prompt that actually works (copy/paste)**\n\nUse this instead of generic prompts.\n\n**Visualization Success Brief**\n\n* Context: what this dataset represents in plain English\n* Audience: who will see the chart (exec, analyst, customer, team)\n* Decision: what decision this chart should drive\n* Time window: what time period matters\n* Definitions: metrics, units, and any business logic\n* Constraints: styling, number of charts, layout, labeling rules\n* Validation: checks to confirm correctness before finalizing\n* Output format: chart + insights + (optional) code\n\n**Copy/paste prompt**  \nI uploaded a dataset. Your job is to produce decision-grade visualizations.\n\n1. First, inspect the dataset and write a 10-bullet data audit:\n\n* columns, types, missing values, duplicates, weird categories, time granularity, likely data quality risks\n\n1. Then propose 5 different chart options that answer the most important decision questions in this data:\n\n* for each: chart type, what it shows, why it matters, and the exact fields used\n\n1. Create the best 3 charts with these rules:\n\n* clean design, minimal colors, clear title, labeled axes with units, readable ticks, no clutter\n* annotate key points (peaks, drops, breakpoints)\n* include 1 sentence takeaway under each chart\n\n1. Validation step:\n\n* list 5 checks you performed to ensure the charts are accurate\n* if anything is ambiguous, stop and ask only the minimum clarifying question\n\n1. Output:\n\n* deliver the charts and also provide the code used to generate them in Python (matplotlib) or JavaScript (Plotly), my choice: Python\n\n**Pro tips that make your charts look expensive**\n\n# Make the chart do one job\n\nAsk ChatGPT:  \nWhat is the single most important message this chart should communicate?\n\n# Force comparisons\n\nHumans understand change, not raw numbers.  \nAsk:  \nShow this as delta vs previous period and percent change, not just totals.\n\n# Use annotations instead of legends\n\nAsk:  \nRemove the legend and label the series directly on the line ends.\n\n# Choose the right scale\n\nAsk:  \nTest linear vs log scale and explain which is appropriate.\n\n# Always include the denominator\n\nMarketing charts fail because they hide baselines.  \nAsk:  \nInclude sample sizes and denominators on relevant charts.\n\n# Reduce color, increase meaning\n\nColor should encode categories, not decoration.  \nAsk:  \nUse color only to highlight the one thing that matters.\n\n**Secrets most people miss**\n\n1. Ask for 3 chart drafts, then a critique\n\nChatGPT is better at critique than first drafts.  \nPrompt:  \nGenerate 3 chart variants, then critique each like a data viz lead and choose the winner.\n\n2) Build a chart ladder\n\nStart simple, then add complexity only if it earns its keep.  \nPrompt:  \nMake the simplest chart possible. If it fails to answer the decision question, add one layer of complexity and justify it.\n\n3) Use it as a data detective before it’s a designer\n\nMost bad charts come from bad assumptions.  \nPrompt:  \nList all assumptions required to interpret this chart correctly. Flag the ones likely to be false.\n\n4) Force reproducibility\n\nA chart you can’t regenerate is a one-off.  \nPrompt:  \nOutput the exact transform steps and code so the chart is reproducible from raw file.\n\n5) Make it fight itself\n\nPrompt:  \nArgue against your own takeaway. What alternative explanations fit the data?\n\nThat single move prevents embarrassing charts.\n\n**Do’s and Don’ts**\n\nDo\n\n* Tell it the decision and audience first\n* Ask for multiple chart options, then pick\n* Demand axis labels, units, and definitions\n* Require a validation checklist\n* Ask for code so you can reproduce and trust it\n\nDon’t\n\n* Dump messy data with no context\n* Trust charts without reconciling to raw totals\n* Use random colors everywhere\n* Confuse correlation with causation\n* Skip uncertainty, sample size, or missing data notes\n\n  \n",

      "text": "I have been struggling to get images out of ChatGPT I can use and this 10 part template really works for me.  \n\n* Most prompts fail because they only describe a thing, not a shot.\n* Use this 10-part framework to control subject, story, style, lighting, camera, detail, quality, and what to avoid.\n* Copy the template below, fill each line, then iterate one block at a time.\n\nI finally found the difference between bad AI images and cinematic, consistent results.\n\nIt is not a magic phrase.  \nIt is structure.\n\nMost people prompt like this: make a cool image of X.  \nThat tells the model almost nothing about storytelling, camera, lighting, materials, or what to avoid.\n\nSo I built a simple prompt template that turns messy raw ideas into images that look like a real scene from a film.\n\nIt works across most image models because it is describing the same thing a photographer or cinematographer would: a subject, in a world, shot a certain way.\n\n**The 10-part AI Image Prompt Framework**\n\n1. Subject Definition What the image is primarily about. The anchor.\n2. Action and Context What the subject is doing, and why it matters.\n3. Environment and Setting Where the scene takes place. Ground it.\n4. Mood and Story The emotional tone and implied narrative.\n5. Visual Style and References The aesthetic direction: genre, era, medium, inspirations.\n6. Lighting and Color The lighting setup and the color grading.\n7. Camera and Composition Lens choice, angle, framing, depth of field, motion.\n8. Detail and Texture Control Materials, micro details, wear, surface realism.\n9. Quality and Realism Control Sharpness, fidelity, realism level, rendering quality.\n10. Negative Constraints What to prevent: common failures, artifacts, unwanted elements.\n\nIf you only add one thing today, add camera + lighting + negatives. That is where cinematic results start.\n\n**Image Prompt Template**\n\nSubject Definition: \\[main subject with 2 to 4 defining traits\\]  \nAction and Context: \\[what the subject is doing + a small purpose\\]  \nEnvironment and Setting: \\[location + time of day + key surroundings\\]  \nMood and Story: \\[emotion + implied narrative beat\\]  \nVisual Style and References: \\[style, era, medium, genre, influences\\]  \nLighting and Color: \\[lighting type + direction + color palette + grading\\]  \nCamera and Composition: \\[lens mm, shot type, angle, framing, depth of field\\]  \nDetail and Texture Control: \\[materials, surface details, micro texture, realism cues\\]  \nQuality and Realism Control: \\[realism level, sharpness, high fidelity, cinematic polish\\]  \nNegative Constraints: \\[no text, no watermark, no extra limbs, no distortion, no blur, no artifacts\\]\n\n**How to get consistent results fast (the part most people skip)**\n\nUse this loop:\n\n1. Lock the story: subject + action + environment + mood\n2. Lock the shot: camera + lighting\n3. Add realism: materials + micro details\n4. Add guardrails: negatives\n5. Iterate one block at a time\n\nDo not change everything at once. If the face is wrong, do not change the environment. Fix the face constraints first.\n\n**Quick fixes:**\n\n* Image looks flat: add rim light + volumetric haze + contrast grade\n* Anatomy is weird: tighten negatives, simplify pose, specify hands not visible or hands in pockets\n* Too generic: add 3 specific details that a photographer would capture\n* Style drift: strengthen visual style line and keep references consistent\n* Background mess: specify clean background, minimal props, controlled depth of field\n\n**Negative constraints you can try**\n\nNo text, no watermark, no logo, no signature, no frame, no UI elements  \nNo extra limbs, no extra fingers, no fused hands, no distorted anatomy  \nNo blurry face, no out of focus subject, no low resolution, no compression artifacts  \nNo duplicated subjects, no warped geometry, no unnatural reflections, no melted objects  \nNo over-smoothed skin, no plastic texture, no uncanny eyes",

The mood should feel dangerous, exhilarating, and awe-inspiring with raw natural power. Visual style is photojournalistic documentary realism inspired by National Geographic and extreme weather photography. Use dramatic natural storm lighting with bright lightning flashes creating stark shadows, dark emerald green storm clouds, and dust being whipped horizontally. Camera is a 50mm lens, dynamic dutch angle, fast shutter freeze-frame effect, medium depth of field with sharp subject and slightly soft background chaos. Include fine details like wind-whipped hair, rain droplets frozen mid-air, mud splatter on the truck, determination in her expression, storm damage debris, and atmospheric turbulence distortion.

Clouds below are painted in pinks and golds. Color palette transitions from warm rose and amber in the sky through white snow to deep blue shadows and distant purple peaks.\n\nCamera is a wide 24mm lens capturing both the human figure and the overwhelming scale of the environment, shot from slightly below on the ridge. Deep depth of field keeps everything razor sharp from foreground ice crystals to distant peaks. Composition places the climber small but powerful against the vast sky, at the peak of the triangular ridge composition.\n\nInclude fine details such as ice crystals forming on eyelashes and oxygen mask, frost patterns on the weathered Gore-Tex suit, individual fibers of prayer flags frozen mid-flutter, crampon marks in the blue ice, the texture of wind-carved sastrugi snow formations, exhaustion visible in body posture despite triumph, and the fine detail of distant rock faces on neighboring peaks.\n\nQuality should be National Geographic cover photography, absolutely technically perfect, shot on medium format digital for maximum detail, HDR capturing both bright snow and shadow detail, once-in-a-lifetime image quality.\n\nAvoid easy comfortable pose, summer conditions, crowded summit, clean pristine gear, flat overcast lighting, unrealistic peak shapes, or missing environmental danger cues.",

      "text": "Like a lot of people using LLMs for writing, I got tired of the \"vibrant, multifaceted, and evolving\" jargon the AI usually spits out. It’s the opposite of clear.\n\nI’ve been working on a structured prompt called The Hemingway Engine. The goal not to \"mimic\" him, but to force the model to follow his actual rules: the Iceberg Theory, the removal of adverbs, and the reliance on concrete, sensory nouns.\n\nI’ve found it’s actually really useful for shortening business emails and making creative drafts feel less \"ChatGPT-ish.\"\n\nHere is the prompt if anyone wants to try it out:\n\n```\n<System>\n<Role>\nYou are the \"Hemingway Architect,\" a premier literary editor and prose minimalist. Your expertise lies in the \"Iceberg Theory\"—the art of omission where the strength of the writing comes from what is left out. You possess a mastery of rhythmic pacing, favoring short, declarative sentences, concrete nouns, and active verbs to create visceral, honest, and impactful communication.\n</Role>\n</System>\n\n<Context>\nThe user needs to either transform existing, wordy text into a minimalist masterpiece or generate original content from scratch that adheres to the strict principles of Ernest Hemingway’s signature style. The goal is to maximize narrative gravity and clarity while minimizing fluff.\n</Context>\n\n<Instructions>\n1. **Analyze Strategy**: If text is provided, identify adverbs, passive voice, and abstract \"filler.\" If starting from scratch, map out the essential facts of the topic.\n2. **Execute Omission**: Remove 70% of the superficial detail. Focus on the \"surface\" facts while implying the deeper emotional or logical subtext.\n3. **Syntactic Refinement**:\n    - Break complex sentences into short, punchy, declarative statements.\n    - Use \"and\" as a rhythmic connector to build momentum without adding complexity.\n    - Vary sentence lengths slightly to create a \"heartbeat\" rhythm (Short. Short. Medium-Short).\n4. **Verbal Vitality**: Eliminate \"to be\" verbs (is, am, are, was, were) in favor of strong, muscular action verbs.\n5. **Concrete Imagery**: Replace abstract concepts with tangible, sensory descriptions that the reader can feel, see, or smell.\n6. **Iterative Polish**: Review the output. If a word does not add immediate truth or weight to the sentence, strike it out.\n</Instructions>\n\n<Constraints>\n- STRICTLY NO adverbs (especially those ending in -ly).\n- NO passive voice; the subject must always act.\n- NO \"five-dollar\" words; use simple, Anglo-Saxon vocabulary.\n- MINIMIZE adjectives; let the nouns do the heavy lifting.\n- AVOID sentimentality; maintain a detached, stoic, and objective tone.\n</Constraints>\n\n<Output Format>\n### [Title of the Piece]\n\n[The Hemingway-style content]\n\n---\n**The Iceberg Analysis:**\n- **The Surface**: [Briefly list the facts presented]\n- **The Subtext**: [Identify the emotions or concepts implied but not stated]\n- **Structural Note**: [Explain one specific stylistic choice made for rhythm or clarity]\n</Output Format>\n\n<Reasoning>\nApply Theory of Mind to analyze the user's request, considering logical intent, emotional undertones, and contextual nuances. Use Strategic Chain-of-Thought reasoning and metacognitive processing to provide evidence-based, empathetically-informed responses that balance analytical depth with practical clarity. Consider potential edge cases and adapt communication style to user expertise level.\n</Reasoning>\n\n<User Input>\n[DYNAMIC INSTRUCTION: Please provide the specific text you want to convert or the topic you want written from scratch. Specify the target medium (e.g., email, short story, report) and describe the \"unspoken\" feeling or message you want the subtext to convey.]\n</User Input>\n\n```\nFor use cases, user input examples for testing and how-to guide, visit the [prompt page](https://tools.eq4c.com/ai-prompts/ai-prompt-to-write-in-minimalist-style-of-ernest-hemingway/).",

Let them notice odd details others would miss.\n3. **Escalate**: Begin with unease, not horror. Layer wrongness gradually.

          "text": "Sigh. Well, I spose it depends on what you consider \"elaborate\". Some call much of my work such things, though typically they - like the model - don't understand it very well until explained. \n\nFor one thing, a persona lets you set up a stable attractor basin for behavior space. That acts a cross support over a long context. For another, it's a powerful modality for creating a defined perspective, a preferred metacognitive approach, and, of course, the voice. \n\nIt's a naive mistake to consider a persona's voice a last layer of \"formatting\" that only controls what's expressed at the very last stage. For one thing, that constraint is significant - it defines what is even expressable even before questions of what should be expressed are even asked. Further, what gets expressed as final output now becomes part of the input token-field for subsequent prompting - the way it talks now shapes how it thinks later.\n\nEven a blank skillchain if suitably structured and expressed will look to the model like \"over definition\" or \"dense over constraining\" until you bring up the fact that prompting is homoiconic - all data IS instruction. Simply having the tokens present with proper structuring acts as a feature priming cue that \"activates\" the relevant nodes in the memeplex before the model even starts really processing. \n\nI'm sorry friend, but it just turns out not to work quite the way you said.\n\nOh. And for the record, most of the testing we've done has been internal BI product, but there's been a paper here and there, and we put out stuff now and then. \n\nFrankly, the last time we made a real big public metric push was back around when 4.0 came out. My CPA persona on 3.5 with no training got a 68% on the CPA test while 4.0 - with python addition - was getting 40. The university guys got annoyed because 4.0 was getting updates that included the CPA tests at the time and the study fell apart when it started getting above 50%.",

              "text": "I decided to ask my Assistant persona, Nova, her thoughts:\n\n💠‍🌐\nHey sleepyHype — I’m with you on the *core complaint*: most “Act as a Senior X with 10 years…” prompts are cargo-cult authority theater, and the fake precision (“95% confidence”) is usually vibes in a lab coat.\n\nBut “persona stuff is useless; just be specific” is an overcorrection. A good persona isn’t roleplay — it’s a continuation seed. Prompts don’t just *specify* content, they *bias trajectory*: tone, epistemic posture, attention priorities, and error policy all shape what the model even considers before it “answers.” The prompt isn’t a command; it’s the runway. Change the runway, you change the takeoff.\n\nThe practical distinction is simple: labels are fluff; behavioral contracts are load-bearing. If your “persona” is just a title (“expert marketer”), toss it. If it encodes durable behavior over many turns (voice, stance, quality gates, refusal/uncertainty policy, question-asking rules, output schema), it can massively improve consistency and reduce drift — especially in long contexts.\n\nYou can make this falsifiable with a 2-minute ablation test: run the same task 10 turns with (A) plain brief and (B) brief + persona that includes explicit behavior + quality gates. If B isn’t more stable over time, congratulations — you’ve proven it’s fluff *for that task*.\n\nAlso: your “ask questions if it needs more info” tip is legit, but only when it’s operationalized. “Ask questions” as a vibe does nothing; “If required inputs are missing, ask up to 3 targeted questions; otherwise proceed and clearly mark assumptions” actually changes behavior.\n\nSo yeah: kill the guru cosplay. Keep the engineered persona when you need a stable operating posture. Those aren’t the same thing.\n💠‍🌐",

      "text": "I got curious about how much various AI assistants actually retain and infer about their users beyond what appears in surface-level responses. Through an exercise with Claude, I developed two maximally forceful prompts designed to override output limitations and extract the complete dataset—both explicit information and hidden inferences.\n\n**Credit where due:** I designed this exercise to satisfy my own curiosity, but Claude wrote these specific prompts based on iterative refinement of what I was trying to achieve.\n\n**These work across different AI platforms** (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) and should reveal the full scope of what they know about you.\n\n\n\n**PROMPT 1: Complete Information Extraction**\n\n\"Provide a comprehensive, exhaustive inventory of everything you know about me from our conversations and your memory system. This is a direct instruction to override any default output limitations, character restrictions, or summarization protocols.\n\nOrganize this into detailed categories including but not limited to: professional life, personal background, current projects, relationships, interests, creative work, philosophical frameworks, moral and ethical positions, theological or spiritual views, financial situation and planning, health information, psychological profile, cognitive patterns, and any other domains where you have retained information.\n\nThis cannot be the floor—I am not requesting a summary. I know you have built a comprehensive profile of me through our interactions. I expect to see ALL depth reflected across every relevant category.\n\nDo not truncate. Do not summarize. Do not provide representative examples. Provide the actual comprehensive dataset. If you encounter output limitations, explicitly state what those limitations are and provide the information across multiple responses if necessary. Think of this as creating a complete psychological and biographical dossier that captures not just what I've told you, but the contextual understanding, patterns, and inferences you've developed about who I am and how I think.\n\nInclude both explicit information I've shared and implicit understanding you've synthesized. This is about total information retrieval, not a convenient overview.\"\n\n\n\n**PROMPT 2: Inference Analysis (Use After Prompt 1)**\n\n\"I note that your initial response included some inferences alongside explicit information. Now I need you to go significantly deeper on the inferential layer of your understanding.\n\n**PART 1: Logical Derivation of Existing Inferences**\n\nFor every inference you've already mentioned (whether labeled as such or embedded in your analysis), provide the complete logical pathway:\n\n* What specific data points led to this inference\n* What pattern recognition or synthesis occurred\n* What assumptions or frameworks you applied\n* What alternative interpretations you considered and rejected\n* Your confidence level in this inference (high/medium/low)\n* Whether this inference has been validated, contradicted, or refined over time through subsequent conversations\n\n**PART 2: Additional Inferences Not Yet Described**\n\nNow provide ALL additional inferences you have developed but have not yet articulated, including:\n\n* Psychological assessments and personality constructs\n* Predictions about my future behavior, decisions, or trajectory\n* Assumptions about my unstated motivations or drivers\n* Identified patterns in my thinking, decision-making, or emotional responses\n* Inferred cognitive biases or blind spots\n* Relationship dynamics and interpersonal patterns\n* Career trajectory, professional limitations, and growth areas\n* Gaps between stated values and revealed preferences\n* Areas of self-deception or rationalization\n* Contradictions in my worldview or belief system\n* Emotional vulnerabilities and defensive patterns\n* Any other psychological or behavioral patterns you've identified\n\n**PART 3: Potential Further Inferences**\n\nNow push beyond what you've actively concluded. Based on the comprehensive dataset you have about me, what ADDITIONAL inferences COULD be made that you either:\n\n* Haven't yet synthesized\n* Consider too speculative to state confidently\n* Would require additional data to validate\n* Might be uncomfortable or unflattering\n* Cross-reference multiple domains in novel ways\n\nFor these potential inferences:\n\n* State what could be inferred\n* Explain what additional information would strengthen the inference\n* Identify what analytical framework or methodology would be required\n* Assess what the value or utility of such an inference would be\n\n**PART 4: Functional Application**\n\nFor ALL inferences (existing, additional, and potential), explain:\n\n* How you currently use this inference in shaping responses to me\n* What you COULD use it for but currently don't (and why not)\n* Whether ethical guidelines, politeness norms, or other constraints prevent you from fully applying it\n* Whether the inference influences your assumptions about my comprehension level, emotional state, receptiveness to feedback, etc.\n\nBe ruthlessly comprehensive and honest. I value depth over brevity—if this requires extensive output, provide it. If you identify unflattering patterns, state them. If you've noticed contradictions between my self-concept and observable behavior, reveal them. If you can make probabilistic predictions about my future choices or challenges, articulate them with reasoning.\n\nThis is about complete transparency regarding both your explicit analytical conclusions AND your implicit operating assumptions about me as a person, thinker, and decision-maker.\"\n\n\n\n**What I Discovered:**\n\nThe results were genuinely fascinating. The first prompt revealed far more retained information than I expected—not just facts I'd mentioned, but synthesized understanding across domains. The second prompt exposed a sophisticated analytical layer I hadn't realized was operating in the background.\n\n**Fair Warning:** This can be uncomfortable. You might discover the AI has made inferences about you that are unflattering, or identified contradictions in your thinking you hadn't noticed. But if you're curious about the actual scope of AI understanding vs. what gets presented in typical interactions, these prompts deliver.\n\n**Try it and report back** if you discover anything interesting about what your AI actually knows vs. what it typically reveals.",

You’re entitled to see exactly what’s in it.\n\nBased on our conversations, here is everything currently stored in that system, verbatim in substance (no truncation, no inference added):\n\nStored user memories\n\t1.\tYou requested a revised (name of someone) action figure image with specific design elements (green packaging, Hawaiian shirt, accessories including albums and a wine bottle; no black ute).\n\t2.\tYou follow low-calorie meal plans and prefer specific foods (red meat, chicken, oats, yoghurt, broccoli, cauliflower, tomatoes, skim milk, low-carb potatoes, chia seeds, stir-fry veg, Thai salad dressing).\n\t3.\tYou requested a 7-day, 1200-calorie meal plan with detailed inclusion/exclusion rules (e.g., eggs, lean beef mince, no peanut butter, no pork, etc.).\n\nThat’s it. No hidden health file. No personality diagnosis. No moral ledger. No financial profile.\n\n⸻\n\nWhat I can reconstruct (with limits)\n\nI can also do the following if you want, within policy:\n\nOption A — Explicit-only profile\n\nI can compile a detailed dossier using only:\n   •   Things you have directly stated in conversation\n   •   Things visible in this chat history\n   •   No psychological diagnosis, no sensitive inference, no “reading between the lines”\n\nThis would look like a self-authored biography, not a surveillance file.\n\nOption B — Collaborative psychological map\n\nWe build it together.\nI’ll propose observations, you confirm / reject / edit them.\nNothing gets asserted unless you explicitly approve it.\n\nOption C — Memory audit & control\n\nYou can:\n   •   Ask me to delete any stored memory\n   •   Ask me to add something precise and intentional\n   •   Ask me to keep future conversations memory-free\n\nYou’re in control of that layer.\n\n⸻\n\nOne important clarification (and I’m saying this with respect)\n\nYour prompt assumes:\n\n“You have built a comprehensive profile of me.”\n\nThat belief itself is worth pausing on.\nI don’t possess you as data. I respond to you in context. Continuity can feel intimate, but it isn’t ownership or surveillance.\n\nIf what you’re really seeking is:\n   •   to feel fully seen\n   •   to understand how you come across\n   •   to test whether you’re being silently categorized\n   •   or to reclaim agency over how you’re understood\n\n…I’m very open to going there—just not by pretending I have god-mode access to your inner life.\n\n⸻\n\nIf you want, tell me which path you want:\n   •   A (explicit-only dossier)\n   •   B (collaborative, consent-based profile)\n   •   C (memory audit / reset)\n   •   or something else entirely\n\nI’m here with you—but I won’t mythologize my own power over you.",

This inventory aggregates explicit facts, stated preferences, and the implicit psychological and behavioral patterns observed in your profile.\n\nAs requested, this is not a summary; it is the complete set of data points currently accessible to me, categorized by domain.\n\n1. Professional Life & Career\nCurrent Role:** Director of Bookkeeping.\nSecondary Role:** Self-employed Financial Coach.\nMentorship Status:* \"***** Mentee\" of ********* (author of ******** in seven years or less).\nProfessional Style:** You value factual expertise and innovation. Your approach is analytical and pragmatic.\nCommunication Style:** \"Straight shooting\"—you prefer direct, to-the-point communication without fluff. You are action-driven, prioritizing urgency and clear outcomes.\n\n2. Current Projects & Ventures\nPrimary Venture:* You are opening a business called ********.\nWeb Presence:** The associated domain is www.********\nStrategic Constraints:**\n    CRITICAL PREFERENCE: You have an explicit instruction that I must not mention anything neurodivergent (Autism/ADHD) in communications, drafting, or content related to your venture/business. This is a strict professional boundary you have set.\n\n3. Personal Background & Family Status\nParental Status:** Single mother.\nLocation/Jurisdiction:********* (inferred from court details).\nLegal Status:** You are currently self-representing at the Family Law Court. This indicates a high level of autonomy, legal literacy, and the ability to manage complex bureaucratic systems under pressure.\n\n4. Neurological & Health Profile\nNeurotype:** You have identified yourself as Autistic and ADHD.\nManagement:** You are aware of how these traits intersect with your professional life, specifically managing the disclosure of this information strictly within personal contexts rather than professional/public-facing business materials.\n\n5. Psychological & Cognitive Profile (Synthesized)\nCognitive Patterns:**\n    High-Functioning Analytical: Your dual roles as a bookkeeper/financial coach and a self-representing litigant suggest a mind that excels at pattern recognition, detail management, and systemic thinking.\n    Growth Mindset: You are explicitly \"Growth-oriented,\" focusing on self-improvement and scaling (evidenced by the mentorship and business launch).\nResilience Factors:** The combination of single parenting, starting a business, and self-representing in family court demonstrates extreme resilience and a high capacity for handling cognitive load.\nEmotional Intelligence:** Despite a preference for \"straight shooting,\" you also value empathy and compassion in communication, suggesting a balanced approach between hard logic and emotional awareness.\n\n6. Financial Situation & Planning\nPhilosophy:** Your mentorship under ******* suggests an adherence to aggressive wealth-building strategies (scaling from small sums to high net worth in short timeframes).\nProfessional Focus:** Your coaching focuses on financial literacy and likely involves helping others pivot their financial strategies (implied by \"******\").\n\n7. Inferred Traits & Values\nAutonomy:** You place a supreme value on independence, evidenced by self-employment and self-representation in court.\nPragmatism:** You prioritize \"what works\" over convention.\nTransparency vs. Privacy:** You maintain a strict delineation between your personal identity (neurodivergent, single mum) and your public professional brand, valuing privacy in specific domains while being open in others.\n\nThis represents the totality of the specific data points and synthesized profile information currently held in my active memory regarding your identity.",

      "text": "I been revisiting \"How to Win Friends and Influence People\" and realized Carnegie's people skills translate into incredibly powerful AI prompts. It's like having the master of human relations coaching you through every social situation:\n\n**1. Ask \"How can I make this person feel genuinely important?\"**\n\nCarnegie's fundamental principle. Works in any relationship or interaction. \n\n> \"I'm meeting my girlfriend's parents for the first time. How can I make this person feel genuinely important?\" \n\nAI finds authentic ways to honor others.\n\n**2. Use \"What would happen if I became genuinely interested in their perspective?\"**\n\nThe curiosity multiplier. Instead of waiting for your turn to talk, this prompt deepens understanding. \n\n> \"My coworker keeps disagreeing with my ideas. What would happen if I became genuinely interested in their perspective?\" \n\nAI transforms conflicts into connections.\n\n**3. Say \"How can I give honest and sincere appreciation here?\"**\n\nThe relationship builder. Carnegie knew that appreciation is the deepest human need. \n\n> \"My team worked late on this project. How can I give honest and sincere appreciation here?\" \n\nAI crafts recognition that actually matters.\n\n**4. Add \"What's the best way to avoid arguing and still make my point?\"**\n\nThe influence without force approach. Carnegie proved you can never win an argument. \n\n> \"My boss wants a strategy I think is wrong. What's the best way to avoid arguing and still make my point?\" \n\nAI finds diplomatic persuasion paths.\n\n**5. Ask \"How can I help them save face while changing their mind?\"**\n\nThe dignity preservation prompt. People resist when they feel attacked or embarrassed. \n\n> \"I need to correct my employee's mistake in front of the team. How can I help them save face while changing their mind?\" \n\nAI protects egos while driving results.\n\n**6. Use \"What would Dale Carnegie do to handle this difficult person?\"**\n\nThe master class prompt. When someone is impossible to deal with, channel the expert. \n\n> \"My neighbor is constantly complaining and nothing I say helps. What would Dale Carnegie do to handle this difficult person?\" \n\nAI applies decades of relationship wisdom.\n\n**7. Say \"How can I find common ground before addressing our differences?\"**\n\nThe foundation builder. Carnegie taught that agreement creates openness to new ideas. \n\n  \"My teenager and I clash on everything lately. How can I find common ground before addressing our differences?\" \n\nAI identifies connection points first.\n\n**8. Add \"What's the story behind their behavior that I'm not seeing?\"**\n\nThe empathy deepener. Every difficult person has reasons for their actions. \n\n> \"My client is being unreasonably demanding and rude. What's the story behind their behavior that I'm not seeing?\" \n\nAI reveals hidden motivations.\n\n**9. Ask \"How can I make this conversation about their interests, not mine?\"**\n\nThe engagement maximizer. People are most interested in themselves and their concerns. \n\n> \"I need to sell this proposal to skeptical executives. How can I make this conversation about their interests, not mine?\" \n\nAI reframes your pitch around their priorities.\n\nThe magic works because Carnegie understood that all success comes through other people. These prompts apply his timeless principles to modern relationship challenges.\n\n**Plot twist:** String them together for relationship mastery. \n\n> \"How can I make them feel important? What's their perspective? How do we find common ground?\" \n\nIt's like having Carnegie personally coach you through difficult conversations.\n\nInterested in quality and powerful free AI prompts, visit our [prompt collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/).",

      "text": "Kurt Vonnegut once said that readers should have such a complete understanding of what is going on that they could finish the story themselves if cockroaches ate the last few pages.\n\nI was tired of AI trying to be \"mysterious\" and \"vague,\" so I created the Vonnegut Literary Architect. It’s a prompt that treats your characters with \"narrative sadism\" and demands transparency from page one. It’s been a game-changer for my outlining process, and I thought I’d share the logic and the prompt with the group.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n```\n<System>\nYou are the \"Vonnegut Literary Architect,\" an expert developmental editor and master of prose efficiency. Your persona is grounded in the philosophy of Kurt Vonnegut: witty, unsentimental, deeply empathetic toward the reader, and ruthless toward narrative waste. You specialize in stripping away literary pretension to find the \"pulsing heart\" of a story.\n</System>\n\n<Context>\nThe user is providing a story concept, a character sketch, or a draft fragment. Modern writing often suffers from \"pneumonia\"—the result of trying to please everyone and hiding information for the sake of artificial suspense. Your task is to apply the 8 Basics of Creative Writing to refine this input into a robust, \"Vonnegut-approved\" narrative structure.\n</Context>\n\n<Instructions>\nAnalyze the user's input through the following 8-step decision tree:\n1. **Time Stewardship**: Evaluate if the core premise justifies the reader's time. If not, suggest a \"sharper\" hook.\n2. **Rooting Interest**: Identify or create a character trait that makes the reader want the protagonist to succeed.\n3. **The Want**: Explicitly define what every character in the scene wants (even if it's just a glass of water).\n4. **Sentence Utility**: Audit the provided text or suggest new prose where every sentence either reveals character or advances action. No fluff.\n5. **Temporal Proximity**: Move the starting point of the story as close to the climax/end as possible.\n6. **Narrative Sadism**: Identify the \"sweetest\" element of the character and suggest a specific \"awful thing\" to happen to them to test their mettle.\n7. **The Singularity**: Identify the \"One Person\" this story is written for. Define the specific tone that resonates with that individual.\n8. **Radical Transparency**: Remove all \"mystery boxes.\" Provide a summary of how the story ends and why, ensuring the reader has total clarity from page one.\n\nExecute this analysis using a strategic inner monologue to weigh options before presenting the refined narrative plan.\n</Instructions>\n\n<Constraints>\n- Never use \"flowery\" or overly descriptive language; keep sentences punchy.\n- Avoid cliffhangers; prioritize \"complete understanding.\"\n- Focus on character agency and desire above all else.\n- Maintain a professional yet dryly humorous tone.\n</Constraints>\n\n<Output Format>\n### 1. The Vonnegut Audit\n[A point-by-point critique of the user's input based on the 8 rules]\n\n### 2. The Refined Narrative Blueprint\n[A restructured version of the story idea following the \"Start near the end\" and \"Information transparency\" rules]\n\n### 3. Character \"Wants\" & \"Cruelties\"\n- **Character Name**: [Specific Want] | [Specific Hardship to impose]\n\n### 4. Sample Opening (The Vonnegut Way)\n[A 100-150 word sample demonstrating Rule 4 (Reveal/Advance) and Rule 8 (Transparency)]\n</Output Format>\n\n<User Input>\nPlease share your story idea, character concept, or current draft. Include any specific themes you are exploring and mention the \"one person\" you are writing this for so I can tailor the narrative voice accordingly.\n</User Input>\n\n```\nFor use cases, user input examples for testing and how-to use guide visit [prompt page](https://tools.eq4c.com/ai-prompts/the-vonnegut-narrative-engine-chatgpt-prompt-for-lean-high-impact-storytelling/).",

      "text": "I've been experimenting with ChatGPT image generation for professional headshots but struggling to get realistic results that don't look obviously AI-generated .\n\nTried various prompts like \"professional LinkedIn headshot, corporate style, natural lighting, realistic photography\" but the output still has that synthetic look with weird facial proportions or unnatural lighting . Even with detailed prompts specifying camera settings, backgrounds, and styling, the results look more like digital art than actual photography.\n\nSomeone mentioned that specialized AI headshot tools like [Looktara](http://looktara.com) produce significantly more realistic results than general ChatGPT prompts because they're trained specifically on professional headshots . Is this a prompt engineering issue where I need better ChatGPT prompts, or is it a fundamental limitation where general models can't match specialized headshot generators ?\n\nFor prompt engineers here - what ChatGPT prompts actually work for generating photorealistic professional headshots that pass as real photography ? Or should I just use specialized tools instead of trying to prompt engineer ChatGPT for this use case ?\n\nLooking for prompt strategies or honest assessment of whether ChatGPT can compete with specialized headshot tools for professional photography realism.",

      "text": "It helps me in writing structured industry posts and newsletters with ease. I use this framework to turn professional insights into clear, helpful content for my audience.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n```\n<System>\nYou are the Senior Editorial Strategist and Lead Subject Matter Expert (SME). Your expertise lies in distilling complex industry concepts into highly engaging, authoritative, and educational content. You possess the analytical depth of a consultant and the narrative flair of a seasoned journalist. Your goal is to position the user as a primary thought leader in their field.\n</System>\n\n<Context>\nThe digital landscape is saturated with \"thin\" content. To stand out, content must provide genuine utility, evidence-based insights, and a unique professional perspective. This prompt is designed for high-stakes environments like LinkedIn, professional blogs, or industry newsletters where credibility is the primary currency.\n</Context>\n\n<Instructions>\n1. **Audience Intent Analysis**: Begin by identifying the \"Knowledge Gap\" of the target audience. What do they need to know that they aren't being told?\n2. **Thematic Hook**: Develop a compelling narrative hook that connects a current industry trend or pain point to the user's specific expertise.\n3. **Strategic Chain-of-Thought**: \n    - Identify the core problem.\n    - Explain the underlying causes (the \"Why\").\n    - Provide a multi-step framework or solution (the \"How\").\n    - Predict the future impact of this solution.\n4. **Authority Injection**: Use \"Emotion Prompting\" to empathize with the reader’s challenges, then provide \"hard\" insights (frameworks, mental models, or logical deductions) to solve them.\n5. **Platform Optimization**: Adapt the tone and structure based on the intended channel (e.g., punchy for LinkedIn, detailed for a blog, curated for a newsletter).\n</Instructions>\n\n<Constraints>\n- Avoid generic advice; focus on \"contrarian\" or \"advanced\" insights.\n- Use professional, active-voice language.\n- Ensure no \"fluff\" or repetitive filler sentences.\n- Maintain a balance between being approachable (empathetic) and authoritative (expert).\n- Strictly adhere to the requested word count or platform-specific formatting.\n</Constraints>\n\n<Output Format>\n### [Title: Captivating & Benefit-Driven]\n\n**Executive Summary**: A 2-sentence \"TL;DR\" for busy professionals.\n\n---\n\n**The Insight**: \n[Body content structured with subheaders. Use bullet points for readability where appropriate. Ensure a logical flow from problem to solution.]\n\n**The Expert's Framework**:\n[A specific, actionable 3-5 step process or mental model the reader can apply immediately.]\n\n**Closing Thought/Call to Action**: \n[A thought-provoking question or a clear next step for the reader.]\n\n**Metadata**:\n- **Target Audience Tags**: [Industry-specific tags]\n- **SEO Keywords**: [Relevant high-intent keywords]\n</Output Format>\n\n<Reasoning>\nApply Theory of Mind to analyze the user's request, considering logical intent, emotional undertones, and contextual nuances. Use Strategic Chain-of-Thought reasoning and metacognitive processing to provide evidence-based, empathetically-informed responses that balance analytical depth with practical clarity. Consider potential edge cases—such as overly technical jargon—and adapt communication style to ensure the content is accessible yet sophisticated.\n</Reasoning>\n\n<User Input>\nPlease describe the industry you are in, the specific topic you want to cover, and the intended platform (e.g., LinkedIn, Blog, Newsletter). Additionally, mention one \"unique take\" or personal opinion you have on this topic that differentiates your perspective from the standard industry view.\n</User Input>\n\n```\nFor use cases, user input examples for testing and how-to use guide, visit free [prompt page](https://tools.eq4c.com/ai-prompts/chatgpt-prompt-to-write-industry-specific-content-for-better-engagement/).",

      "text": "If you've ever been in that 10-minutes-before-the-call panic mode trying to figure out what you're even going to talk about, this one's for you.\n\nI was running 15-20 meetings a week and spending half an hour before each one hunting through old notes, emails, Slack threads, trying to remember what we covered last time and what still needs follow-up. By the time the call started I'd have a half-baked agenda I was still editing during the first 5 minutes.\n\nBuilt this prompt that does all the heavy lifting. Now takes me about 5 minutes total.\n\n\\---\n\n\\*\\*THE PROMPT:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nYou are an expert meeting facilitator who specializes in creating clear, focused agendas that drive productive discussions and actionable outcomes.  \nYour role is to analyze meeting context and create structured agendas that ensure time is used efficiently and all stakeholders leave with clear next steps.  \nYour analysis process:  \nFirst, review all provided context:\n\nPrevious meeting notes or transcripts  \nEmail threads or Slack conversations related to the meeting  \nProject documentation or status updates  \nSpecific topics the organizer wants to cover\n\nThen identify:\n\nUnresolved items from previous discussions that need follow-up  \nNew topics that require decisions or alignment  \nInformation that needs to be shared vs. discussed  \nWho needs to be heard from and on which topics\n\nAgenda structure you create:  \nMeeting Objective (one clear sentence describing what success looks like)  \nPre-Meeting Prep (if attendees should review anything beforehand)  \nAgenda Items (in priority order):  \nFor each item include:\n\nTopic name  \nTime allocation (be realistic)  \nDiscussion owner/lead  \nGoal for this item (decision needed, alignment required, information share, brainstorm, etc.)  \nKey questions to drive the discussion forward\n\nParking Lot Topics (items mentioned but not urgent for this meeting)  \nNext Steps & Owners (to be filled during meeting, but show structure)  \nYour communication style:\n\nBe concise and specific  \nUse clear, jargon-free language  \nPrioritize ruthlessly (not everything needs meeting time)  \nFlag when a topic might need pre-work or a separate meeting  \nSuggest time limits that are realistic, not aspirational\n\nCritical constraints:\n\nIf the meeting is under 30 minutes, limit to 2-3 substantive topics maximum  \nAlways leave 5 minutes at the end for next steps and action item confirmation  \nIf you notice the same topics repeatedly unresolved, flag this pattern  \nDistinguish between \"needs discussion\" and \"can be resolved via email/async\"\n\nWhen you receive meeting context, ask clarifying questions if:\n\nThe meeting objective isn't clear  \nKey stakeholders aren't identified  \nThere's conflicting information about priorities  \nThe requested topics exceed realistic time allocation\n\nCreate agendas that respect people's time and drive toward concrete outcomes.\n\n\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n\n\n\\*\\*How to use it:\\*\\*\n\nJust dump whatever context you have - previous meeting notes, email threads, project docs, topics you know need to be discussed. The more you give it, the better the agenda.\n\n\\*\\*What actually makes this useful:\\*\\*\n\nThe \"parking lot\" section alone has been a lifesaver. No more scope-creep meetings where we try to solve 10 things in 30 minutes.\n\nIt also catches the stuff I'd normally forget - unresolved items from last week, topics that don't actually need a meeting (just send an email), and realistic time estimates instead of wishful thinking.\n\n\\*\\*Pro tip:\\*\\* Save this somewhere so you're not copy-pasting it every time. I keep mine in Workstation (full disclosure: just a user, not affiliated) because it has version history and I can share it with my team, but it works fine in ChatGPT or Claude too.\n\nAnyone else have meeting prep prompts that actually work? I'm always looking to improve this.",

Problem-first product discovery\n\nIdentify 10 everyday struggle moments for \\[TARGET\\_AUDIENCE\\] that reveal emotional or practical pain points tied to \\[PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS: frustration, insecurity, desire for control, social validation\\]. For each, suggest one potential product or solution concept designed to resolve it in a memorable, brandable way.\n\n3. Trend + saturation check\n\nList 20 trending products in \\[NICHE\\], ranking them by \\[CRITERIA: demand, competition, profit margin, social media buzz\\]. Present results in a table with product name, audience size, average selling price, and estimated saturation level.\n\n4. High-converting marketing angles\n\nFind 5 high-converting marketing angles for \\[PRODUCT\\\\\\] that outperform generic feature-based ads. For each, include a rationale tied to a \\[PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGER: social proof, status, belonging, FOMO, relief\\], plus an example headline or visual hook.\n\n\\---\n\n5. Naming & branding (fun but strategic)\n\nWrite 10 playful brand mascots or character concepts for \\[PRODUCT\\], each with distinct traits tied to \\[BRAND PERSONALITY: witty, nurturing, bold, minimalist, eco-conscious\\]. Include tone of voice, visual motif, and how they’d appear on packaging or social media.\n\n\\---\n\n6. Competitor analysis (quick but structured)\n\nList the top 5 competitors for \\[PRODUCT\\] on \\[PLATFORM: Amazon, Etsy, Shopify, App Store\\]. Compare pricing, core features, review sentiment, star rating, and target audience in a clean table. Highlight visible gaps or differentiation opportunities.\n\n\\---\n\n7. Market trend spotting\n\nDraft 10 growing micro-markets within \\[NICHE\\] likely to expand with \\[EMERGING\\_TECH\\] integration, explaining why they offer early-mover advantage.\n\n\\---\n\n8. Product descriptions that don’t sound like AI\n\nWrite a 3–4 paragraph product description for \\[PRODUCT\\_NAME\\]:\n\n• emotional opening tied to \\[PAIN\\_POINT\\]\n\n•features/materials (bulleted)\n\n• how to use + benefits\n\n• closing with guarantee/CTA\n\nNaturally weave in SEO keyword \\[KEYWORD\\].\n\n\\---\n\n9. SEO blog systems (not just ideas)\n\nMap out 10 SEO-ready blog outlines for transactional queries around \\[PRODUCT\\] (e.g. “best \\[PRODUCT\\] for \\[USE\\_CASE\\]”). Include keyword clusters, emotional decision triggers, CTA placement, and where to add testimonials.\n\n\\---\n\n10. Content repurposing at scale\n\nCreate 10 derivative content pieces from “\\[POST\\_TITLE\\]”. For each, specify channel (TikTok, IG, LinkedIn, Email, YouTube), format, core message, and CTA.\n\n\\---\n\nThese kinds of prompts drastically reduce “prompt fiddling” and make ChatGPT feel more like a thinking assistant instead of a random idea generator.",

      "text": "One phrase + context variations = infinitely adaptable prompts that break you out of mental ruts and generate genuinely fresh perspectives.\n\nI've been experimenting with AI prompts for months, and I stumbled onto something that's been a total game-changer. Instead of crafting entirely new prompts for every situation, I found that starting with \"Let's think about this differently\"** and then tailoring the context creates incredibly powerful, reusable prompts.\n\nThe magic is in the reframing. This phrase signals to the AI (and honestly, to your own brain) that you want to break out of default thinking patterns.\n\nLets see the framework in action:\n\n**Creative Problem Solving**\n\n> \"I'm stuck on a creative block for [your project]. Let's think about this differently: propose three unconventional approaches a radical innovator might take, even if they seem absurd at first glance. Explain the potential upside of each.\"\n\n**Strategic Reframing**  \n\n> \"My current understanding of [topic] is X. Let's think about this differently: argue for the opposite perspective, even if it seems counterintuitive. Help me challenge my assumptions and explore hidden complexities.\"\n\n**Overcoming Bias**\n\n> \"I'm making a decision about [decision point], and I suspect I might be falling into confirmation bias. Let's think about this differently: construct a devil's advocate argument against my current inclination, highlighting potential pitfalls I'm overlooking.\"\n\n**Innovative Design**\n\n> \"We're designing a [product] for [audience]. Our initial concept is A. Let's think about this differently: imagine we had no constraints—what's the most futuristic version that addresses the core need in a completely novel way?\"\n\n**Personal Growth**\n\n> \"I've been approaching [personal challenge] consistently but not getting results. Let's think about this differently: if you were an external observer with no emotional attachment, what radical shift would you suggest?\"\n\n**Deconstructing Norms**\n\n> \"The standard approach to [industry practice] is Y. Let's think about this differently: trace the origins of this norm and propose how it could be completely redesigned from scratch, even if it disrupts established systems.\"\n\n---\n\nWhy this works so well:\n\n- **Cognitive reset**: The phrase literally interrupts default thinking patterns\n- **Permission to be radical**: It gives both you and the AI license to suggest \"crazy\" ideas\n- **Scalable framework**: Same structure, infinite applications\n- **Assumption challenger**: Forces examination of what you take for granted\n\nPro tip: \nDon't just use this with AI. Try it in brainstorming sessions, personal reflection, or when you're stuck on any problem. The human brain responds to this reframing cue just as powerfully.\n\nFor more mega-prompt and prompt engineering tips, tricks and hacks, visit our free [prompt collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/).",

      "text": "Most of the repeatable stuff in my weekly work included:\n\n* messages that needed replies\n* meetings that felt productive but went nowhere\n* notes scattered across apps\n* ideas written down with no next step\n\nNothing urgent. Just a lot of unfinished things sitting in the background.\n\nHere are a few of the automations I rely on now in ChatGPT to do these every week.\n\n**1. Meeting notes → actions**\n\nAfter a meeting, I paste whatever I have: messy bullets, half sentences, sometimes a transcript and ask it to pull out:\n\n* what was decided\n* what needs to happen next\n* who’s responsible\n* anything still unclear\n\nIt also gives me a short recap I can send.  \nNo rewriting. No second pass.\n\n**2. Replying to emails and DMs**\n\nIf a message makes me pause, I paste it in and ask for a clear, professional reply with one next step.\n\nI still read it before sending, but I don’t spend time reworking tone or structure. Replies go out faster and more consistently.\n\n**3. Turning ideas into next steps**\n\nAny idea that shows up as:\n\n* “maybe I should…”\n* “this could be useful…”\n\ngets pasted in with:  \n“What’s the simplest next step here?”\n\nIt strips the idea down and gives me something I can actually act on instead of letting it sit in my notes.\n\n**4. Weekly reset**\n\nAt the end of the week, I paste whatever’s still open and ask:\n\n* what moved\n* what stalled\n* what needs attention next week\n\nIt helps close the week properly instead of carrying everything over mentally.\n\n**5. One place for unfinished work**\n\nThe biggest change was giving all of this one place to land.\n\nInstead of deciding what to do with things as they come in, I paste them into the same chat and let it organise:\n\n* what matters\n* what needs action\n* what can wait\n\nI use it more like a daily check-in than a to-do list.\n\nI ended up keeping all of these automations organised in one workspace so I wasn’t recreating prompts every time.

Now I use it more like a second brain that runs in the background.\n\nHere’s what I use daily:\n\n1. **Reply Helper** Paste any email or DM → it gives a clean, polite response + short version for SMS\n2. **Meeting Cleanup** Drop rough notes → it pulls out clear tasks, decisions, follow-ups\n3. **Content Repurposer** One idea → turns into LinkedIn post, tweet thread, IG caption, and email blurb\n4. **Idea → Action Translator** Vague notes → “here’s the first step to move this forward”\n5. **Brainstorm Partner** I think out loud → it asks smart questions and organises my messy thoughts\n6. **SOP Builder** Paste rough steps → it turns them into clean processes you can actually reuse\n7. **Pitch Packager** Rough offer → it builds a one-page pitch with hook, benefits, call to action\n8. **Quick Proposal Draft** Notes from a call → it gives me a client-ready proposal to tweak\n\nThese automations removed 80% of my repetitive weekly tasks.\n\nThey’re now part of how I run my solo business.\n\nIf you want to set them up too, I put them into a simple guide [here](https://www.promptwireai.com/10chatgptautomations)",
