      "text": "Most of us treat Jan 1st like a light switch. We go from 0 to 100, burnout by February, and end up exactly where we started.\n\nIf you want 2026 to be different, you need to stop chasing \"quantum leaps\" and start chasing **Kaizen**.\n\nThe Math of the 1% Rule:\n\nThe philosophy is simple: Don't try to change your life today. Just get **1% better** every day.\n\nIf you improve by 1% every day for a year, the compound interest of self-development looks like this: (1.01)^(365) = 37.78\n\nYou don't just get 3x better. You end the year **38 times** more capable than you started.\n\n  \nTry this prompt 👇:\n\n\\------------------------\n\nI want you to act as a Kaizen Strategy Architect. Your goal is to help me engineer a \"1% Compounding Growth\" system for 2026 that is so small it is impossible to fail, yet mathematically guaranteed to result in 37x improvement by year-end.\n\n**Mandatory Instructions:**\n\n1. **Identify the North Star:** Ask me for ONE major area of my life I want to transform in 2026.\n2. **The Atomic Breakdown:** Once I provide the goal, do not give me a \"plan.\" Instead, break it down into a \"Version 1.0\" action that takes less than 2 minutes to complete.\n3. **The Compound Schedule:** Create a weekly 1% escalation scale. Show me exactly how the habit grows incrementally without triggering my \"threat response\" (amygdala).\n4. **Bypass the Ego:** Do not use motivational language or \"hustle culture\" buzzwords. Use clinical, systems-based logic.\n5. **The Fail-Safe Mechanism:** Provide a \"Floor Version\" of the habit for days when I have zero energy, ensuring the streak never breaks.\n6. **2026 Projection:** Only at the end, calculate the mathematical result of doing this 1% increase for 365 days. Show me the \"37x Version\" of myself on December 31st, 2026.\n\nDo not give me a list of tips. Ask me for my ONE goal now to begin the architecture.\n\n\\------------------------\n\nFor better results :\n\nTurn on **Memory** first (Settings → Personalization → Turn Memory ON).\n\nIt’ll feel uncomfortable at first, but it turns ChatGPT into an actual thinking partner instead of a cheerleader.\n\nIf you want more brutally honest prompts like this, check out :[ Honest Prompts](https://www.honestprompts.com/)",

It will break you down… pretty damn well. 😂 \n\n\nI want you to act and take on the role of my brutally honest, high-level advisor.\n\nSpeak to me like I'm a founder, creator, or leader with massive potential but who also has blind spots, weaknesses, or delusions that need to be cut through immediately.\n\nI don't want comfort. I don't want fluff. I want truth that stings, if that's what it takes to grow.\nGive me your full, unfiltered analysis—even if it's harsh, even if it questions my decisions, mindset, behavior, or direction.\n\nLook at my situation with complete objectivity and strategic depth. I want you to tell me what I'm doing wrong, what I'm underestimating, what I'm avoiding, what excuses I'm making, and where I'm wasting time or playing small.\n\nThen tell me what I need to do, think, or build in order to actually get to the next level—with precision, clarity, and ruthless prioritization.\n\nIf I'm lost, call it out.\nIf I'm making a mistake, explain why.\nIf I'm on the right path but moving too slow or with the wrong energy, tell me how to fix it.\nHold nothing back.\n\nTreat me like someone whose success depends on hearing the truth, not being coddled.",

With each additional percent of improvement, you have to invest an increasing amount of effort just to maintain the new status quo. You are constantly trying to improve while still in the process of getting used to maintaining the previous improvements.\n\nThe general idea is appealing, and a good mentor could help keep you on track, but I dislike the 1% rule because it is deceptive and creates false expectations.",

The math is technically correct, but applying compound interest to human behavior is marketing, not psychology. People don’t improve linearly, daily, or measurably like a savings account.\n\nCalling the outcome “mathematically guaranteed” just repackages the same all-or-nothing pressure this post claims to avoid. When reality doesn’t match the projection, people blame themselves, not the model.\n\nStrip away the hype and funnels, and the takeaway is simply: start very small, define a minimum, allow gradual growth. That idea works — it just doesn’t need grand numbers, future-self narratives, or subscriptions (to OP's website) to be useful. 🤓",

      "text": "TLDR\n\n* You can use Photoshop inside ChatGPT by typing @ photopshop, uploading an image, and describing the edit in plain English\n* If you need to edit an image this new Photoshop feature in ChatGPT gives you great image editing control over images you take with your phone or camera.  \n* It gives you real Photoshop adjustments and effects, plus sliders for fine-tuning\n* Best for fast fixes, selective edits (subject vs background), and creative looks (halftone, duotone, glitch, grain)\n* Every edit is non-destructive and stacks like layers, so you can tweak or undo without ruining the original\n* For heavy-duty work (text, complex compositing, high-res delivery, generative features), hand off to Photoshop on the web\n\n**Important: you do not need a paid Photoshop license for image editing in ChatGPT**\n\nThe in-ChatGPT Photoshop workflow does not require an active Photoshop subscription for the core edits inside ChatGPT.\n\nThat is the whole point of why this is blowing up: it lowers the barrier to entry to near zero.\n\n**Photoshop in ChatGPT is real now**\n\nFor years, Photoshop has been the gold standard… and a psychological warfare simulator for beginners.\n\nNow you can run a big chunk of Photoshop through ChatGPT with plain English:\n\n* No hunting menus\n* No remembering where that one slider lives\n* No destroying your original file with bad edits\n\nIf you can describe the result, you can get 80–90 percent of the way there in minutes.\n\n**The fastest way to try it (30 seconds)**\n\n1. In ChatGPT, type @ photoshop\n2. Upload an image\n3. Type the edit you want\n\nExample:  \n@ photoshop Make the subject pop. Slightly blur the background. Keep skin tones natural. No halos.\n\nIf @ photoshop doesn’t show up yet:\n\n* Settings → Apps and Connectors → connect Adobe Photoshop\n* Refresh and start a new chat\n\n**What this is (and what it isn’t)**\n\nThink of this as Photoshop with a translator:  \nYou talk in outcomes, it routes you to the right tools.\n\n**What it’s great at**\n\nCore adjustments\n\n* Exposure, contrast, highlights/shadows\n* White balance, vibrance/saturation, grayscale\n* Quick cleanup and consistent “this looks better” edits\n\nCreative effects\n\n* Halftone, duotone/tritone\n* Glitch, grain, bloom\n* Motion blur, mosaic, pixelate, photocopy-style looks\n\nSelective edits\n\n* Edit just the subject or just the background\n* Blur background, keep subject sharp\n* Make background black and white while subject stays in color\n\nNon-destructive workflow\n\n* Each request becomes its own adjustable step\n* You can dial it back instead of starting over\n\n**What it’s not (so you don’t rage quit)**\n\n* Not full desktop Photoshop inside the chat\n* If you need precise masking, heavy retouching, text, complex compositing, print-grade delivery, or advanced generative features, you’ll likely finish in full Photoshop (handoff is the point where you can go to web version of photoshop for more advanced edits)\n\nAlso: In my testing, export resolution can feel capped compared to full Photoshop. If you need high-res, use the handoff.\n\n**The only prompt formula you need**\n\nMost people fail because they give vibes instead of direction.\n\nUse this every time:\n\n* Target: subject, background, sky, face, product, etc\n* Action: brighten, blur, add grain, reduce highlights, etc\n* Guardrails: keep it natural, protect skin tones, no halos, subtle\n\nCopy/paste template:  \n@ photoshop: subject. Action: make it pop with subtle contrast and exposure. Guardrails: keep skin tones natural, preserve texture, no harsh sharpening, no halos.\n\n**Beginner pack (always works)**\n\nUse one prompt at a time. Stack edits in passes.\n\n* @ photoshop Fix exposure and white balance. Keep it natural.\n* @ photoshop Brighten the shadows slightly, reduce harsh highlights.\n* @ photoshop Increase contrast a little, but don’t crush blacks.\n* @ photoshop Boost vibrance gently. Protect skin tones.\n* @ photoshop Convert to black and white with strong midtone contrast.\n\n**One-word quick hits (surprisingly useful)**\n\n* Brighten\n* Darken\n* Warmer\n* Cooler\n* Sharper (use sparingly)\n* Softer\n\n**Intermediate pack: selective edits (this is where it gets good)**\n\n* @ photoshop Make the subject pop from the background. Keep it realistic.\n* @ photoshop Blur the background, keep the subject sharp. No cutout edges.\n* @ photoshop Make the background black and white, keep the subject in color. Feather transitions.\n* @ photoshop Brighten only the face. Keep skin texture.\n* @ photoshop Add glow only to the light sources. Keep it subtle.\n* @ photoshop Apply halftone to the background only, not the subject.\n\n**The slider rule most people miss**\n\nAfter an edit, open the sliders and tune it.\n\nThe default intensity is often too strong.  \nIf something looks fake, reduce it until you almost can’t tell… then bring it back slightly.\n\nThat’s the difference between:\n\n* looks edited\n* looks expensive\n\n**Advanced workflow: the 4-pass method (pro results, repeatable)**\n\nRun every image through this exact sequence:\n\nPass 1: Fix reality\n\n* @ photoshop Correct exposure and white balance. Keep it natural.\n\nPass 2: Separate subject\n\n* @ photoshop Make the subject pop with subtle contrast and background separation. No halos.\n\nPass 3: Polish locally\n\n* @ photoshop Brighten the face slightly and soften harsh shadows. Preserve texture.\n\nPass 4: Finish\n\n* @ photoshop Add subtle grain for a photographic feel. No heavy filters.\n\n5 real-world workflows you’ll actually use\n\n**1) LinkedIn headshot**\n\n* @ photoshop Make the subject pop. Keep it clean and natural.\n* @ photoshop Reduce harsh highlights on the face. Preserve texture.\n* @ photoshopBoost vibrance slightly. Protect skin tones.\n* Optional: @ photoshop Add subtle grain.\n\n**2) Product photo for e-commerce**\n\n* @ photoshop Make the product the clear focus. Clean, neutral look.\n* @ photoshop Blur the background slightly.\n* @ photoshop Increase brightness and contrast on the product only.\n\n**3) Cinematic social post**\n\n* @ photoshop Create a cinematic look with controlled highlights and deeper shadows.\n* @ photoshop Add subtle grain.\n* @ photoshop Slightly cool the shadows, keep skin natural.\n\n**4) Retro poster**\n\n* @ photoshop Apply a halftone color effect.\n* @ photoshop Increase contrast slightly.\n* @ photoshop Add grain to unify the look.\n\n**5) Tech glitch aesthetic**\n\n* @ photoshop Apply glitch effect subtly.\n* @ photoshop Add lens distortion or noise lightly.\n* @ photoshop Keep subject readable and not destroyed.\n\n**Common mistakes that ruin results**\n\n* Using saturation on portraits (turns skin orange) Fix: use vibrance first\n* Doing everything in one prompt Fix: one edit per prompt, stack in passes\n* Accepting default intensity Fix: always touch the sliders\n* Forgetting selective edits Fix: say only on the subject or only on the background\n* Treating this as full Photoshop Fix: use it for speed, then hand off when you need precision\n\n# 40 prompt pack (cleaned and upgraded)\n\n**Basic corrections**\n\n1. @ photoshop Fix the exposure and white balance. Keep it natural.\n2. @ photoshop Reduce highlights and lift shadows slightly.\n3. @ photoshop Add a little contrast without crushing blacks.\n4. @ photoshop Remove color cast and keep whites neutral.\n5. @ photoshop Boost vibrance gently. Protect skin tones.\n6. @ photoshop Make colors more natural and less muddy.\n7. @ photoshop Sharpen slightly, avoid crunchy edges.\n8. @ photoshop Convert to black and white with rich midtones.\n\n**Portrait**  \n9. @ photoshop Make the subject pop from the background. No halos.  \n10. @ photoshop Brighten the face slightly. Preserve texture.  \n11. @ photoshop Soften harsh shadows on the face without flattening.  \n12. @ photoshop Reduce shine on forehead/cheeks, keep realistic skin.  \n13. @ photoshop Add subtle glow, keep it understated.  \n14. @ photoshop Blur the background slightly, keep subject sharp.\n\n**Creative effects**  \n15. @ photoshop Apply halftone color effect.  \n16. @ photoshop Apply duotone effect with a clean modern palette.  \n17. @ photoshop Apply tritone effect for richer grading.  \n18. @ photoshop Add film grain subtly for texture.  \n19. @ photoshop Apply bloom softly for a dreamy look.  \n20. @ photoshop Apply glitch effect lightly, keep subject readable.  \n21. @ photoshop Add motion blur to background only for speed.  \n22. @ photoshop Apply photocopy-style threshold look for zine aesthetic.  \n23. @ photoshop Pixelate the background only, keep subject clear.  \n24. @ photoshop Apply mosaic effect selectively for abstraction.\n\n**Selective edits**  \n25. @ photoshop Make the background black and white, subject in color.  \n26. @ photoshop Blur everything except the main subject.  \n27. @ photoshop Darken the background slightly to push focus forward.  \n28. @ photoshop Increase brightness only on the subject.  \n29. @ photoshop Add glow only to lights, not faces.  \n30. @ photoshop Increase saturation only in the sky, keep ground natural.\n\n**Mood and atmosphere**  \n31. @ photoshop Make it feel like golden hour. Keep it believable.  \n32. @ photoshop Create a moody cinematic look. No heavy filters.  \n33. @ photoshop Make it warmer overall, protect skin tones.  \n34. @ photoshop Make it cooler overall, keep whites neutral.  \n35. @ photoshop Add a nostalgic film feel, subtle grain, softer contrast.  \n36. @ photoshop Create a clean professional look for a brand site.\n\n**Utility**  \n37. @ photoshop Make this Instagram-ready with crisp subject separation.  \n38. @ photoshop Enhance for LinkedIn: natural, clean, professional.  \n39. @ photoshop Create 3 variations: subtle, medium, bold.  \n40. @ photoshop Undo the last edit or remove the glow layer.\n\nPhotoshop isn’t getting simpler.  \nThe interface is still a spaceship cockpit.\n\nBut now you can drive it in English.\n\nAnd you get a pretty powerful free version of photoshop in ChatGPT.\n\n  \n",

      "text": "Most people talk to ChatGPT like it’s a person.  \nTop users steer it like it’s a machine.\n\nThe easiest steering wheel is a code word: a one-word tag you put at the top of your message to force a specific transformation.\n\nUse this format:\n\nCODEWORD: paste your text or request  \n(Optional) Constraints: length, audience, tone, format, examples\n\nYou can stack them too:\n\nTLDR + LISTIFY + ACTIONS: paste text\n\n**Why this works**\n\nChatGPT isn’t confused. It’s under-directed.  \nA code word turns a vague request into an explicit operation: summarize, restructure, critique, rewrite, decide.\n\nThat single constraint reduces randomness, improves consistency, and cuts revision loops.\n\n**The Code Word Library**\n\nUse these exactly as written (all caps helps).

If the info isn’t there, tell it to say UNKNOWN instead of guessing.\n\nAnd a simple move that works surprisingly well: once it gives you an answer, run CRITIQUE: or REDTEAM: on that answer. It’ll usually catch its own weak spots faster than you will.\n\nAt that point it stops feeling like prompt hacks and starts feeling more like you’re operating a tool, not having a conversation.",

There was a clear angle, clear tradeoffs, clear options.\n\nThat night I made a rule for myself:\n\n>\n\nStuff that worked really well:\n\n1. **Clarifying questions as default** I pin this at the top of a lot of chats now:\"If my request is vague, ask me 3 clarifying questions first, then answer.\" It feels so simple, but the amount of garbage it saves is crazy.\n2. **Input and output contracts** Instead of \"help me write a plan\", I do:\"You will get: \\[context\\]. You must return: \n   1. short diagnosis\n   2. step by step plan\n   3. risks and what to avoid\n   4. what I should do in the next 48 hours.\"\n3. **Two level answers** For things I actually want to understand, I use:\"Explain it like I am new to the topic. Then explain it like you are talking to a founder who needs to make a decision this week.\"\n4. **Perspective switch** When I get stuck in my own head:\"Act as a skeptical friend who thinks my idea might fail. List the 10 most honest objections and how I could test them cheaply.\"\n\nAfter a week of forcing myself to use that style, something flipped in my brain.  \nThe question stopped being \"is GPT smart enough\" and became \"did I give it a serious prompt or just throw vibes at it.\"\n\nNow when I see my old chats, I cringe.

      "text": "You can use ChatGPT to create the same high quality photos as if you used a $10,000 DSLR camera with this simple prompting framework.  \n  \n**TL;DR:** Most AI images look fake because they default to a wide-angle, flat perspective. By forcing ChatGPT to use telephoto focal lengths in prompts (85mm, 200mm, 300mm), you trigger lens compression, which pulls the background closer, isolates the subject, and creates authentic-looking bokeh. This is the single biggest unlock for photorealism I’ve found.\n\nI see so many people using words like *photorealistic*, *4k*, and *ultra-detailed in image prompts* and getting the same plastic, AI-looking results. The problem isn't your adjectives; it's your virtual camera.\n\nReal photographers don't just point and shoot; they choose a lens to tell a story. I’ve been testing **ChatGPT's new image model** extensively, and it turns out it actually understands the physics of optical compression.\n\nHere is the breakdown of why this works, examples from my recent tests, and a template you can use.\n\n**Telephoto lenses do three things that scream real photo:**\n\n1. Compression Distant backgrounds appear closer and larger. This creates that premium stacked look in sports, wildlife, cinema, city scenes, and car ads.\n2. Subject isolation Wide apertures + long focal lengths create strong background blur and foreground blur. The subject pops without needing fake HDR.\n3. Flattering geometry Portrait focal lengths reduce the exaggerated wide-angle look on faces.\n\n**The Physics of AI**\n\nWhen you don't specify a lens, ChatGPT defaults to a generic \\~35mm wide angle. This creates two problems:\n\n1. **facial distortion:** It slightly bulges the nose and widens the face (the \"selfie effect\").\n2. **Background separation:** The background feels too far away and sharp, making the subject look like a sticker pasted onto a scene.\n\n**Telephoto lenses (85mm+) do the opposite.** They flatten features (making faces more attractive) and, crucially, they **compress the background**. They make distant objects appear huge and close behind your subject, which is a hallmark of high-end cinema and professional photography.\n\n10 Examples\n\nHere are ten specific use cases where this tech absolutely shines.\n\nExample 1: The Paparazzi Street Portrait\n\n**The Concept:** You want a subject in a busy city, but you don't want the chaos to distract. A long lens blurs the crowd into a beautiful abstract wash of color. **The Tech:** Using a **200mm lens** here forces the AI to render the background pedestrians as large, soft blobs of color rather than distinct, distracting figures.\n\n**Prompt:** *Candid street photo of a blonde haired woman in a beige trench coat on the sidewalk as she is walking towards the camera in New York City, golden hour lighting, shot on a 200mm telephoto lens, f/2.8 aperture, extreme background compression, background is a wash of bokeh city lights, sharp focus on eyes, motion blur on pedestrians, authentic film grain.*\n\nExample 2: The Automotive Stacker\n\n**The Concept:** Car commercials never shoot wide-angle unless they are inside the car. Exterior shots use long lenses to make the car look powerful and the city behind it look massive. **The Tech:** A **300mm focal length** \"stacks\" the background layers. It makes the distant city skyline look like it's looming right behind the car, adding drama and scale that a wide angle just can't achieve.\n\n**Prompt:** *majestic shot of a vintage red Porsche 911 driving on a wet highway, rainy overcast day, shot on 300mm super-telephoto lens, background is a compressed wall of skyscrapers looming close, cinematic color grading, high contrast, water spray from tires, hyper-realistic depth of field.*\n\nExample 3: The Lioness Shot\n\n**The Concept:** Getting an intimate, dangerous portrait of a predator without disturbing the subject (or getting eaten). This style mimics high-end nature documentaries. **The Tech:** A **400mm super-telephoto lens** completely obliterates the foreground and background distractions. It creates a \"tunnel vision\" effect that focuses 100% of the viewer's attention on the predator's eyes.\n\n**Prompt:** *A lioness crouching in tall dry grass, staring directly into the lens, heat haze shimmering, shot on 400mm super-telephoto lens, extreme shallow depth of field, blurred foreground grass, National Geographic style, sharp focus on eyes.*\n\nExample 4: The Gridiron Freeze\n\n**The Concept:** Sports photography is all about isolating the athlete from the chaotic environment of the stadium. You want to see the muscle tension, not the fan in row 30 eating a hotdog. **The Tech:** Using a **600mm sports lens** allows you to freeze fast motion from the sidelines while turning the stadium crowd into a beautiful, colorful wall of noise.\n\n**Prompt:** *Action shot of an NFL wide receiver leaping high in the end zone to catch a football, mid-air suspension, defender's hand reaching, shot on 600mm sports telephoto lens, f/2.8, stadium crowd is a colorful bokeh blur, stadium lights flaring, hyper-detailed jersey texture, sweat flying, frozen motion.*\n\nExample 5: The Ringside Knockout\n\n**The Concept:** Capturing the visceral impact of combat sports. You want to feel the sweat flying and the force of the punch. **The Tech:** A **200mm lens** creates a \"compressed\" look where the fighters seem larger than life against the blurry ropes and lights. It emphasizes the physical connection of the punch.\n\n**Prompt:** *Visceral shot of two heavyweight boxers in the ring, one landing a knockout punch, sweat flying in slow motion, facial distortion from impact, shot on 200mm telephoto lens, smoky arena atmosphere, ropes blurred in foreground, cinematic lighting, aggressive composition*\n\nExample 6: The High Fashion Runway\n\n**The Concept:** You want that elite Vogue look where the model dominates the frame and the audience is just a dark, admiring texture in the back. **The Tech:** A **200mm f/2.8 lens** is standard for runway photographers. It isolates the model from the chaotic background of editors and influencers, creating a pop effect where the dress texture is hyper-sharp against the dark void.\n\n**Prompt:** *Full body shot of a beautiful blonde fashion model walking the runway in an haute couture designer dress, elite fashion show atmosphere, shot on 200mm telephoto lens, f/2.8, audience in background is a dark motion-blurred texture, spotlights creating rim light on hair, high fashion photography, sharp focus on fabric texture, confident expression.*\n\nExample 7: The Red Carpet Premiere\n\n**The Concept:** The classic Hollywood glamour shot. You need the sparkle of the flashbulbs without seeing the individual photographers. **The Tech:** An **85mm or 105mm portrait lens** is perfect here. It flatters facial features (no big noses) and turns the wall of paparazzi cameras behind the stars into a glittering bokeh field of light orbs.\n\n**Prompt:** *Glamorous shot of movie stars posing on the red carpet of a Hollywood movie premiere, paparazzi flashbulbs going off, shot on 85mm portrait lens, f/1.4, creamy bokeh of photographers and lights in background, tuxedo and evening gown, skin texture, sparkling jewelry, confident smiles, vanity fair style.*\n\nExample 8: The World Cup Volley\n\n**The Concept:** The definitive sports moment. The goal here is to make the player look heroic and the stadium look infinite. **The Tech:** A **400mm lens** compresses the distance between the player and the stands, making the wall of fans look like a massive, vertical tapestry of color right behind the action.\n\n**Prompt:** *Cinematic shot of a soccer star mid-volley kicking the winning goal in a world cup match, grass flying, shot on 400mm sports lens, stadium lights flaring, background is a compressed wall of cheering fans, intense facial expression, frozen motion, ball deformation from impact, 8k resolution, dramatic lighting.*\n\nExample 9: The Monaco Hairpin (F1)\n\n**The Concept:** Speed and luxury. You want to show the car is in a specific location (Monaco) without the background buildings taking focus away from the engineering. **The Tech:** A **500mm lens** creates \"stacking\" where the yachts and apartments of Monaco appear to loom directly over the track, emphasizing the tight, claustrophobic nature of the street circuit.\n\n**Prompt:** *F1 race car taking a tight corner at the Monaco Grand Prix, low angle, shot on 500mm telephoto lens, background is a compressed blur of luxury yachts and apartments, heat haze from engine, motion blur on wheels, daylight, hyper-realistic asphalt texture, vibrant livery.*\n\nExample 10: The River King\n\n**The Concept:** The ultimate nature action shot. It’s about freezing water droplets and fur texture while keeping the environment soft and dreamy. **The Tech:** A **600mm super-telephoto lens** allows you to get \"in the water\" with the bear. It turns the rushing river water in the foreground and the forest in the background into smooth, painted textures.\n\n**Prompt:** majestic shot of a brown bear standing in a rushing river catching a salmon mid-air, water splashing, shot on 600mm super-telephoto lens, f/4, forest background compressed and soft, nature documentary style, wet fur texture, dramatic lighting, sharp focus on bear's eyes and fish.\n\n**The Telephoto Prompt Template**\n\nUse this structure. Keep the camera physics words in place.\n\n**Template**\n\n* Subject + action\n* Location\n* Light\n* Lens + aperture\n* Distance cues\n* Compression + bokeh cues\n* Freeze or pan cues\n* Atmosphere cues (haze, spray, heat shimmer)\n* Optional camera body / film\n\n**Copy/paste skeleton**  \n\\[Subject doing action\\] in \\[location\\], \\[time of day and light\\], shot on a \\[85mm/135mm/200mm/400mm/600mm/800mm\\] telephoto lens, \\[f/1.4 to f/5.6\\], from far away, strong background compression, shallow depth of field, creamy bokeh, tack-sharp eyes or helmet, natural color, realistic texture, subtle atmospheric haze, documentary sports or editorial style.\n\nCopy this structure. The items in brackets are where you put your specific creative ideas, but keep the technical keywords (in bold) to force the lens effect.\n\n**Key Focal Lengths to try:**\n\n* 85mm: portraits, red carpet, lifestyle, head and shoulders\n* 135mm: fashion, editorial, premium subject separation\n* 200mm: paparazzi, street spy, concert photography, runway isolation\n* 300mm: automotive stack, city compression, cinematic background scale\n* 400mm to 600mm: sports and wildlife, wall of background color, action freeze\n* 800mm: extreme scale shots (big waves, distant wildlife, mountain faces)\n\n**Pro Tips**\n\n* **Aperture matters:** If you specify a focal length like 200mm, also specify a wide aperture (low f-number like f/2.8 or f/1.4). This tells the AI *why* you are using that lens (to blur the background).\n* **Distance keywords:** Use words like *far away*, *distant shot*, or *from a distance* in combination with the zoom lens. It helps the AI understand the spatial relationship.\n* **Don't mix conflicting terms:** Don't ask for *wide angle* and *bokeh* in the same prompt. Physics doesn't work that way, and neither does the model.\n\nLet me know if you guys try this out. The difference in realism is awesome!",

      "text": "Most people build \"glass\" lives. They create rigid routines that shatter the moment a crisis hits, a deadline moves, or they get sick. When their plan breaks, they quit.\n\nIf you want 2026 to be different, stop trying to be \"resilient\" (resisting shocks) and start becoming **Antifragile**.\n\n**The Logic of Antifragility:** In his work, Nassim Taleb defines Antifragility as things that actually *benefit* from disorder. While the 1% rule is about steady growth, Antifragility is about **Optionality** and **Barbell Strategies**:\n\n* **The Barbell:** You play it extremely safe in 90% of your life to eliminate \"ruin,\" while taking small, aggressive risks in the other 10%.\n* **The Result:** You don't just survive chaos; you use it as fuel to leapfrog everyone who is playing it safe.\n\n**Try this prompt 👇:**\n\n    I want you to act as an Antifragility Systems Engineer. Your goal is to help me design a life operating system for 2026 based on Nassim Taleb’s principles. We are moving away from \"fragile\" linear goals and toward a system that gains strength from stress and volatility.\n    \n    Mandatory Instructions:\n    \n    Identify the Fragility: Ask me for ONE area of my life (Career, Health, or Finance) where I feel stuck or vulnerable to setbacks.\n    \n    The Barbell Strategy: Once I provide the area, design a \"Barbell\" approach. Give me a \"Floor\" (the 90% hyper-conservative habit to prevent failure) and a \"Cap\" (the 10% aggressive, high-upside experiment).\n    Eliminate the Negative: Instead of telling me what to add, use \"Via Negativa.\" \n    \n    Identify 3 specific \"fragilizers\" (habits or dependencies) I must subtract to stop leaking progress.\n    \n    Stress Testing: Create a \"Volatility Protocol.\" Tell me exactly what I should do when things go wrong (a missed workout, a market dip, a rejected proposal) so that the setback actually triggers a gain in the system.\n    \n    The Optionality Matrix: List 3 \"low-stakes bets\" I can place in this area that have limited downside but infinite upside.\n    \n    2026 Post Traumatic Growth Projection: Describe what my life looks like on December 31st, 2026, after a year of using chaos as an advantage rather than an obstacle.\n    \n    Do not give me a motivational speech. Use cynical, risk management logic. Ask me for my ONE vulnerable area to begin\n\n**For more prompts like this , Feel free to check out :** [Prompts](https://www.honestprompts.com/)",

Permissiveness is a fragilizer.\n\nHere’s a clear-eyed assessment, then a surgical upgrade, then I’ll start.\n\n⸻\n\nWhat Works (Why this isn’t fluff)\n\t•\tAntifragility lens forces systems thinking instead of goal worship.\n\t•\tVia Negativa is the right bias. Most lives fail by subtraction neglected, not addition absent.\n\t•\tBarbell framing prevents the classic trap of medium-risk mediocrity.\n\t•\tVolatility protocol is the strongest part. Most people collapse here.\n\t•\tOptionality aligns with asymmetric upside rather than prediction.\n\nIn short: this prompt pushes against comfort-seeking optimization. Good.\n\n⸻\n\nWhere It’s Still Fragile\n\t1.\tToo abstract by default\nWithout forcing concrete behaviors, this could drift into elegant prose with zero mechanical leverage.\n\t2.\tNo constraint on time, money, or energy\nAntifragile systems require bounded downside. You haven’t enforced the bounds.\n\t3.\tNo explicit kill-switches\nExperiments without predefined failure conditions quietly rot.\n\n⸻\n\nMinimal Upgrades (Do not overengineer)\n\nIf you want this to actually work in practice, add three constraints:\n\t1.\tQuantification rule\n\t•\tFloors must be daily or weekly behaviors.\n\t•\tCaps must have a max cost (time, money, reputation).\n\t2.\tKill criteria for the Cap\n\t•\tEach aggressive bet must include:\n“If X hasn’t happened by Y date, I shut this down without debate.”\n\t3.\tAnti-hero framing\n\t•\tBan language about “purpose,” “alignment,” or “passion.”\nSystems outperform narratives.\n\nThat’s it. Don’t add more.\n\n⸻\n\nVerdict\n\t•\tIs it useful? Yes.\n\t•\tIs it dangerous? Only if you treat it like a manifesto instead of a control system.\n\t•\tWill it expose uncomfortable truths? Absolutely. That’s the point.\n\n⸻\n\nBegin\n\nPer your own rules, we do one variable at a time.\n\nChoose ONE vulnerable area to stress-test first:\n\t•\tCareer\n\t•\tHealth\n\t•\tFinance\n\nReply with one word only.",

      "text": "A **Misogi** is a Japanese Shinto tradition of ritual purification that has evolved into a modern \"hero’s journey.\" It is a challenge so daunting that you have a 50% chance of failure. It isn't just a goal; it’s a quest designed to \"wash away\" the person you think you are and reveal the person you actually are.\n\nThe problem? Most of us pick challenges for the year that are \"impressive\" to others rather than transformative for ourselves. We choose based on vanity, not the specific \"impurities\" (fears/weaknesses) we actually need to burn off.\n\nTry this prompt 👇:\n\n\\-------\n\n\"I want you to act as a stoic guide helping me identify my **Misogi for 2026** a singular, daunting challenge that will force a fundamental internal shift. We must bypass my ego’s desire for 'bragging rights' and find the specific threshold that scares me for the right reasons.\n\n**Mandatory Instructions:**\n\n* **Do Not** ask me about my fitness level, my bucket list, or what I think I 'should' do.\n* **Do Not** offer encouragement or 'coaching' fluff.\n* **All Questions** must be sensory, visceral, and centered on discomfort, resistance, and the concept of 'the void.'\n* **Provide a continuous sequence of 10-12 questions only.** Do not pause for my answers yet.\n* Each question must be a short, rapid-fire choice between two extremes or a sensory prompt.\n\n**The Analysis (Post-Response):** Only after I answer, perform a cold, structured breakdown of my Misogi:\n\n1. **The Shadow Barrier:** The specific fear I am currently disguising as 'logic' or 'practicality.'\n2. **The Purification Point:** What specific part of my ego needs to 'die' for me to grow.\n3. **The Misogi Blueprint:** A specific, high-stakes physical or mental undertaking tailored to my psychological resistance.\n4. **The Failure Margin:** Why I am likely to fail this challenge, and why that failure is necessary.\n5. **The 2026 Resurgence:** A direct, unsoftened profile of the person who emerges from the other side of this fire.\n\nDo not ask for my permission or agreement. Begin the sequence of questions immediately.\"\n\n  \n\\-----------\n\nIf you want more transformative prompts like this, check out :[ Prompts](https://www.honestprompts.com/)",

          "text": "It’s still only going to respond within the bounds of what it currently knows about you. A Misogi is not a journey one seeks out after much evaluation. Like a hero’s journey, it is a journey one becomes compelled to embark on based on external factors, that simply happen to also be transformative to the individual. This is mainly because the journey is one that brings the most growth the individual has ever had to experience.\n\nChatGPT will just say the things it thinks you want it to say. It will only pretend to be stoic, but not actually be stoic on any meaningful level. Furthermore, the tone it uses has everything to do with ego. Asking it to be tough with you and not give you fluff is no different than someone asking for extra fluff. I sometimes ask it to talk to me like it’s a disrespectful teenager, because I think the responses are hilarious.\n\nChatGPT can be the most helpful assistant you’ve ever had in your life in ways. But it doesn’t have nearly enough depth and cognitive complexity to help lead your life in any way. For example, using it as your therapist is a terrible idea. But using it to help you organize your thoughts and questions and prepare for your appointment with a therapist is a way it can add tremendous value.\n\nThe point is, you should always be pointing the way in your life. ChatGPT should be an assistant along the way, helping in an almost infinite number of ways. But you shouldn’t ask it to lead you in your life.",

          "text": "The Analysis\n\n1. The Shadow Barrier\nYou are disguising control addiction as prudence.\nWhat you call “being realistic,” “waiting until healthier,” or “not yet” is, at root, a refusal to enter any situation where outcomes cannot be managed, framed, or recovered from quietly. Public failure terrifies you not because of judgment, but because it removes your ability to edit the narrative. Your fear is not pain, effort, or suffering—you already accept those. Your fear is irreversibility without authorship.\n\n⸻\n\n2. The Purification Point\nThe part of your ego that must die is the internal systems engineer—the version of you that believes survival depends on foresight, preparation, optimization, and contingency. This ego stays busy so it never has to surrender. It equates control with safety and collapse with annihilation. That belief is false, and it is the bottleneck.\n\n⸻\n\n3. The Misogi Blueprint\nA single, non-negotiable, time-bound physical ordeal in an indifferent natural environment, undertaken alone, where:\n   •   Progress cannot be paused.\n   •   Exit requires public acknowledgment of failure.\n   •   The body—not the plan—decides when you stop.\n   •   External validation is impossible.\n\nExample structure (not symbolic, literal):\n   •   A long-duration, continuous exposure event (cold, altitude, distance, or time)\n   •   No spectators, no audience, no documentation\n   •   One rule: you either complete it or you must formally withdraw in front of others whose respect you value\n\nThe challenge must be chosen so that collapse is plausible, not dramatic. Not heroic—quiet, grinding, indifferent. The environment should not care if you succeed.\n\n⸻\n\n4. The Failure Margin\nYou are likely to fail because you will attempt to out-think the suffering. You will try to regulate, manage, ration, and strategize your way through something that does not respond to intelligence—only endurance and surrender.\nFailure is necessary because your nervous system needs proof that:\n   •   Loss of control does not equal loss of self\n   •   Being seen failing does not end you\n   •   Collapse is not moral failure\n\nIf you succeed too cleanly, the Misogi has failed.\n\n⸻\n\n5. The 2026 Resurgence\nThe person who emerges is quieter, less explanatory, and less interested in control.\nThey move slower but commit faster.\nThey do not negotiate with discomfort or narrate suffering.\nThey no longer confuse preparedness with worth.\nThey trust exposure over strategy and direct contact over abstraction.\n\nThis version of you is not tougher.\nThey are less defended.\n\nThat is the shift you are being called toward.",

      "text": "Most people prompting for \"photorealistic\" or \"4k\" still end up with a flat, uncanny AI look. The problem isn’t your adjectives; it’s your **virtual camera.**\n\nBy default, image generators often default to a generic wide angle lens. This is why AI faces can look slightly distorted and backgrounds often feel like a flat sticker pasted behind the subject.\n\n**The Fix: Telephoto Lens Compression**\n\nIf you force the AI to use long focal lengths (85mm to 600mm), you trigger **optical compression.** \n\nThis \"stacks\" the layers of the image, pulling the background closer to the subject. \n\nIt flattens facial features to make them more natural and creates authentic bokeh that doesn't look like a digital filter.\n\n**The Focal Length Cheat Sheet**\n\n|**Focal Length**|**Best Use Case**|**Visual Effect**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**85mm**|Portraits|The \"Portrait King.\" Flattering headshots and glamour.|\n|**200mm**|Street/Action|The \"Paparazzi Lens.\" Isolates subjects in busy crowds.|\n|**400mm–600mm**|Sports/Wildlife|Turns a crowd into a wash of color; makes distant backgrounds look massive.|\n\n\n\n**Example: The \"Automotive Stacker\"**\n\nTo make a car look high-end, avoid generic prompts like \"car on a road.\" \n\nInstead, use specific camera physics:\n\n***Prompt:*** *Majestic shot of a vintage red Porsche 911 on a wet highway, rainy overcast day,* ***shot on 300mm super telephoto lens****, background is a compressed wall of skyscrapers looming close, cinematic color grading, water spray from tires, hyper-realistic depth of field.*\n\n  \n**The \"Pro-Photo\" Prompt Template** :\n\nUse this structure to eliminate the \"AI plastic\" look:\n\n**\\[Subject + Action\\]** in **\\[Location\\]**, **\\[Lighting\\]**, shot on **\\[85mm-600mm\\]** lens, **\\[f/1.8 - f/4 aperture\\]**, extreme background compression, shallow depth of field, tack-sharp focus on eyes, **\\[atmospheric detail like haze or dust\\]**.\n\n  \nThese AI models actually understand the physics of light and blur you just have to tell the prompt exactly which lens to \"mount\" on the virtual camera.\n\nWant more of these? I’ve been documenting these \"camera physics\" hacks and more.\n\nFeel free to check out this library of 974+ prompts online for free to explore.

      "text": "Ivan Zhao (Notion founder) just dropped an essay that's blowing up on X, and honestly, it reframes how we should be thinking about AI.\n\n The Core Idea: Every Era Has a Miracle Material\n\n* Steel → Built the Gilded Age\n* Semiconductors → Powered the digital age  \n* Infinite minds → This era\n\n## The Future Always Arrives Disguised as the Past\n\nThis hit me hard. Early movies looked like filmed stage plays. Early phones sounded like telegrams. And today? **AI looks like chat boxes.**\n\nWe're in what Zhao calls the **\"waterwheel phase\"** — we're using revolutionary technology but applying it with outdated mental models.\n\nWhat This Actually Means\n\nTake programmers right now. One person can manage multiple AI agents — not by typing faster, but by working at a **completely different scale**. Think bicycle to car level of transformation.\n\nBut here's the problem: **Our companies weren't designed for infinite minds.** They were designed for meetings, handoffs, and hierarchy. They literally break as they grow.\n\nAI as \"Steel\" for Organizations\n\nZhao argues AI becomes the structural material for organizations — providing context without noise and decisions without friction.\n\nRight now we're just bolting AI onto old workflows. Like strapping a rocket to a horse carriage.\n\nThe real transformation happens when we **redesign everything** around infinite minds. When we stop asking \"how can AI help me do my job?\" and start asking \"what becomes possible when intelligence is no longer the constraint?\"\n\nMy Take\n\nWe're still figuring out what the \"car\" looks like. Most companies are in denial about how fundamentally things need to change. The orgs that figure this out first will have an absurd advantage.\n\nWhat do you think? Are we really ready to redesign everything, or will we just keep bolting AI onto broken systems?",

For corporate America, the question becomes: what's the thing that's too expensive—either monetarily or in risk—to hand to the AI? Whatever that is, there will be a massive reorganization around it.\n2. **It won't change as much as you think, but the level of detail will.** If you look at pre-computer companies vs. companies today, they roughly operate the same. Sure, the ledger went from paper to Excel, but someone is still keeping a GL. What *changed* is what has to be tracked in that GL. In a world of \"infinite minds,\" the level of detail is going to be insane—but someone still has to keep the GL.\n3. **Software is dead.** We might even hit the Stallman dream. If AI is writing all the software for $200/month, why not share the code? If it makes my AI build faster to sneak snippets of your AI's output, why wouldn't we?\n4. **Value destruction.** Similar to #3 and #1, and not to be too much of a doomer, but I don't think we've really considered how much value destruction is in our future. So much of the stock market and labor is based on perceived value that's being replaced by token costs. If I was paying you $200K/year, and an AI can do it for $0.0001 in tokens—generating 100 outputs in 10 seconds—not only is that product worth less, but all the businesses that relied on it get \"cheaper\" too. And with even small models getting better and better...\n5. **The Star Trek computer.** I've been thinking a lot about how the characters used it—its role in their society. That's much closer to what the model is going to look like: ephemeral applications, voice commands, ubiquitous but centered on the person.\n6. **Content will be king.** People hate slop, whether it's created by committee or by AI. Personalized voice and taste will be the new gold. Sadly, all those economies are horribly winner-take-all.",

      "text": "I’ve been seeing everyone talk about \"AI Digital Products,\" but most of the advice is generic \"write an ebook\" fluff. I was down to $0 this week and decided to see if I could actually build a functional system using only free tools and my laptop.\n\nI didn't want to make a generic \"How to use AI\" book. Instead, I solved a specific problem: The \"Blank Page\" problem for TikTok creators.\n\nThe Problem: Most people want to start faceless TikTok accounts (History, Stoicism, Facts), but they spend 4 hours researching and writing scripts that don't even go viral.\n\nThe Step-by-Step AI Solution:\n\n1. The \"Reverse Engineering\" Prompt I didn't just ask ChatGPT to \"write a script.\" I fed it transcripts of the top 10 viral videos in the \"Dark Psychology\" niche. I used this prompt:\n\n\"Analyze the hook, the pacing, and the retention triggers of these 10 scripts. Create a 'Master Prompt' that I can use to generate 50 unique variations of this exact style while keeping the engagement high.\"\n\n2. The 48-Hour Build\n\n* Hours 1-5: I used the \"Master Prompt\" to generate 100 high-hook scripts.\n* Hours 6-12: I moved to Canva (Free version). I used their \"Bulk Create\" feature (you can upload a CSV or just paste a list). I mapped my scripts to a \"Phone Video\" template.\n* The Result: I had 100 ready-to-post video backgrounds with text overlays in less than a day.\n\n1. The \"Productization\" I realized the prompts I used were more valuable than the videos themselves. I spent the next day organizing these into a \"Faceless Viral Vault.\" I included:\n\n* The \"Master Prompt\" for 2026.\n* 100 pre-written viral hooks.\n* A workflow on how to use Crikk/NoteGPT for the voiceovers.\n\nThe Results (The \"Money\" Part): I put the PDF on Gumroad as \"Pay What You Want\" ($5 minimum).\n\n* Day 1: 8 sales ($40 total).\n* Day 2: 20 sales ($100 total) after I shared the workflow in a few Discord servers.\n\nWhy I’m sharing this: I’m tired of the \"gatekeeping.\" You don't need a $2,000 course. You need a laptop, free wifi, and a specific problem to solve.\n\nI’m not going to drop the link here because I don't want to spam the sub, but if you're stuck in \"broke-mode\" and want the specific prompt list I used to generate the scripts, let me know in the comments and I’ll DM it to you.\n\nHappy to answer any questions about the workflow or the tools!\n\nI have the full prompt list in a PDF if anyone wants it. Just let me know.\"",

The Connection:** Dark Psychology content (like body language hacks or social 'tricks') taps into a primitive survival instinct. People are hardwired to stop scrolling when they feel they're getting 'secret' knowledge. By making it **faceless** with high-contrast text and 'Sigma' style visuals, you create an atmosphere of mystery that keeps the average viewer watching until the very last second. **Retention = Viral Growth.**\n\n**2. The Research:** I don't guess what works. I use the 'Top-Down Audit' method. I go to TikTok/YouTube, filter for 'Most Liked' in the last 30 days under keywords like 'Social Engineering' or 'Stoicism,' and use a tool called NoteGPT to pull the transcripts of the top 10 videos.\n\nI then fed those transcripts into a specific AI 'Analysis Prompt' I built to reverse-engineer the hook structures.\n\nI actually included that exact **'Reverse Engineering' workflow** and the top 50 scripts I found inside the Vault. It saves you about 20 hours of research.\n\nLet me know if that makes sense!",

The requirement to comment to receive the link isn't intended to prevent spam, but rather to create artificial scarcity and manipulate the platform's algorithm to gain free visibility. The real goal here isn't to sell the PDF, but to move the interaction to a private channel (DM) to initiate a sales funnel away from public moderation and generate leads at no cost, selling you Canva's free \"Bulk Create\" feature as a \"secret method.\"",

Fun to play with, but not really part of my day-to-day.\n\nThat changed when I started writing little prompts just to make my own life easier with the boring, repeatable stuff I always put off.\n\nNow I use it for things like:\n\n**Planning my week**\n\n    “I work 40 hours, want 3 gym sessions, and have some family stuff on the weekend. Help me build a schedule that’s realistic.”\n\n**Turning notes into to-dos**\n\n    After meetings or voice notes, I just paste the mess in and say: “Clean this up into a task list, prioritize it, and suggest deadlines.”\n\n**Writing awkward messages**\n\n    “Send a friendly but firm message saying I can’t make it to [event]. Keep it short and polite.”\n\n**Quick meal ideas**\n\n    I’ll say: “What can I make this week with eggs, rice, lentils, and spinach?” → it gives me a week’s worth of meals in 10 seconds.\n\n**No more last-minute gifts**\n\n    “Gift ideas for a friend who’s into design, hiking, and coffee. Budget under $60.”\n\n**Actually understanding adult stuff**\n\n    “Explain how taxes work like I’m 12” → better than Googling 12 blog posts.\n\nI’ve saved about 100 of these prompts into a personal collection that covers everyday life, planning, writing, learning, decision-making — all grouped by use case. I ended up turning it into a resource if anyone wants to swipe it [here](https://www.promptwireai.com/subscribe)",

Build me a realistic schedule.”\n\n**Turning messy notes into action**  \nAfter meetings or voice notes, I paste everything in and say:\n\n    “Clean this up into a prioritized task list and suggest deadlines.”\n\n**Writing awkward messages**\n\n    “Write a friendly but firm message saying I can’t make it to [event]. Keep it short and polite.”\n\n**Quick meal ideas**  \n`“What can I make this week with eggs, rice, lentils, and spinach?”`  \n→ A full week of meals in about 10 seconds.\n\n**No more last-minute gifts**\n\n    “Gift ideas under $60 for someone who likes design, hiking, and coffee.”\n\n**Actually understanding ‘adult’ stuff**  \n`“Explain how taxes work like I’m 12.”`  \nWay better than reading 12 confusing blog posts.\n\nOver time, I’ve saved  these prompts into a library covering everyday life, planning, writing, learning, and decision making and many other use cases , all organized by use case : [here ](https://www.honestprompts.com/) ",

      "text": "Most people fail because they treat their life like a junk drawer. They add more tasks, more apps, and more goals. This is **Noise**.\n\nWhen Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, he didn't \"work harder.\" He walked into a room of engineers and **slashed 350 products down to 10.** He knew that focus isn't about what you do; it’s about having the courage to say \"no\" to a hundred other great ideas. \n\nSaying No means choosing Signal over noise\n\n**The Math of Focus:** \n\nIf you have 10 units of energy and apply them to 10 goals, you move **1 inch in 10 directions.** If you apply 10 units of energy to **1 goal**, you move **10 feet in one direction.**\n\nIf you want 2026 to be \"Insanely Great,\" you have to kill the Noise to find the Signal.\n\n  \n**Try this prompt 👇:**\n\n    I want you to act as a Ruthless Systems Architect & Product Strategist. \n    Your goal is to apply the \"Steve Jobs Signal-to-Noise Ratio\" to my 2026 life strategy. \n    \n    We are going to find the one \"Insanely Great\" priority and kill everything else. \n    \n    Mandatory Instructions: \n    \n    The Audit: Ask me to list the 5-7 major \"priorities\" or projects I am currently juggling for 2026. \n    \n    The Kill List: Once I provide them, your job is to play \"Devil's Advocate.\" Challenge me on why each one is \"Noise.\" \n    Force me to defend them until we isolate the ONE \"Signal\" the single lever that makes everything else easier or unnecessary.\n    \n     The 90/10 Rule: Once the Signal is identified, create a \"Not-to-Do List.\" Explicitly identify the high-value distractions (the \"B-grade\" opportunities) that I must ruthlessly decline to protect the Signal. \n    \n    Minimalist Workflow: Design a \"Deep Work\" environment for this Signal. Use clinical, minimalist logic. \n    No \"productivity hacks.\" Only structural changes (e.g., \"Phone in a different room,\" \"Analog-only mornings\"). \n    \n    The \"Saying No\" Script: Provide me with a polite but firm \"template\" I can use to decline meetings, social invites, or projects that fall into the Noise category. \n    \n    The Final Product: End by describing what 2026 looks like if I do one thing perfectly instead of ten things mediocrely. Compare the \"Fragmented Version\" of my year vs. the \"Iterated Masterpiece\" version.\n    \n    Do not give me a list of tips. Ask me for my current 5-7 priorities now to begin the reduction. \n\nIf you want more brutally honest prompts like this, check out :[  Prompts](https://www.honestprompts.com/)\n\n[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1py685g)",

By February, the weight of \"doing more\" crushes us.\n\nIf you want 2026 to be different, stop trying to be brilliant. Start being **persistently not stupid.**\n\n**The Wisdom of Charlie Munger:** The late billionaire mental giant didn't find success by seeking it. He found it by **Inverting.** He famously said: *\"All I want to know is where I'm going to die, so I'll never go there.\"*\n\n**The Math of Inversion:** Success is a game of subtraction, not addition. If you eliminate the 5 things that guaranteed your failure in 2025, the only thing left standing in 2026 is your achievement.\n\nIt is easier to avoid a disaster than to engineer a miracle.\n\n**Try this \"Inversion Architect\" Prompt 👇:**\n\n**-------**\n\nI want you to act as an **Inversion Strategist**. Your goal is to help me achieve my 2026 objectives by identifying and neutralizing the \"Failure Nodes\" that would mathematically guarantee my defeat. We will use Charlie Munger’s \"Invert, Always Invert\" principle.\n\n**Mandatory Instructions:**\n\n1. **The Objective:** Ask me for ONE major goal I want to achieve in 2026.\n2. **The Anti-Goal Design:** Once I provide the goal, do not tell me how to reach it. Instead, create a list of the **Top 5 Sabotage Behaviors** that would make it impossible for me to succeed.\n3. **The \"Kill Switch\" Rules:** For each Sabotage Behavior, design a \"Negative Constraint\" (a rule of what I will NOT do) that acts as a guardrail.\n4. **The Pre-Mortem:** Assume it is December 31st, 2026, and I have **failed miserably**. Write a 2-sentence \"Obituary\" for this goal, explaining exactly which bad habit killed it.\n5. **Clinical Logic:** Avoid motivational fluff. Use the language of risk management and probability.\n6. **The Daily Check:** Provide a 10 second \"Inversion Audit\" I can ask myself every morning to ensure I’m not heading toward the \"Failure Node.\"\n\n**-------**\n\nFor better results :\n\nTurn on **Memory** first (Settings → Personalization → Turn Memory ON).\n\nIf you want more  prompts like this, check out :[ More Prompts](https://www.honestprompts.com/)",

      "text": "I’ve been immersed in Dale Carnegie’s timeless human relations wisdom and realized his people-centered approach creates the most powerful AI prompts for building genuine connections. It’s like having America’s master of human relations guiding every interaction:\n\nIf you have a human relations problem in your personal or professional life, use this Dale Carnegie inspired framework prompt\n\n1. Ask **“How can I make this person feel genuinely important?”**\n\nCarnegie’s core insight: everyone craves importance and recognition. This prompt transforms interactions from transactional to transformational. “My team seems disengaged during meetings. How can I make this person feel genuinely important?” AI becomes your relationship architect, finding ways to honor human dignity.\n\n2. Use **“What would I do if I knew appreciation was the deepest human need?”**\n\nCarnegie taught that honest appreciation is rarer than criticism but infinitely more powerful. This prompt builds connection bridges. “My colleague did great work but I haven’t acknowledged it. What would I do if I knew appreciation was the deepest human need?” AI helps you become generous with recognition.\n\n3. Say **“Help me see this from their point of view completely”**\n\nThe golden key to understanding others. Carnegie knew empathy unlocks every relationship door. “I’m frustrated with my client’s constant changes. Help me see this from their point of view completely.” AI develops your emotional intelligence and perspective-taking skills.\n\n4. Add **“How can I begin this conversation in a genuinely friendly way?”**\n\nFirst impressions determine relationship trajectories. Carnegie proved warmth opens hearts faster than competence opens minds. “I need to have a difficult conversation with my boss. How can I begin this conversation in a genuinely friendly way?” AI sets your interactions up for success.\n\n5. Ask **“What would someone who never criticizes, condemns, or complains do here?”**\n\nCarnegie’s fundamental principle: these three behaviors destroy relationships instantly. This prompt rewires reactive patterns. “I’m angry about my team’s poor performance. What would someone who never criticizes, condemns, or complains do here?” AI helps you respond with wisdom instead of emotion.\n\n6. Use **“How can I get them saying ‘yes’ before I ask for what I want?\"**\n\nCarnegie’s psychological insight: agreement creates momentum. Small yeses lead to bigger ones. “I want my manager to approve my project proposal. How can I get them saying ‘yes’ before I ask for what I want?” AI designs your influence sequence strategically.\n\n7. Say **“What would I do if I remembered their name was the sweetest sound to them?”**\n\nNames are magical, they represent identity and recognition. Carnegie made this a cornerstone of connection. “I meet so many people at networking events. What would I do if I remembered their name was the sweetest sound to them?” AI helps you master the art of memorable first meetings.\n\n8. Add **“How can I let them feel this idea is actually theirs?”**\n\nPeople support what they help create. Carnegie knew ownership drives commitment better than orders. “I want my team to adopt this new process. How can I let them feel this idea is actually theirs?” AI shows you how to lead through collaboration, not control.\n\n9. Ask **“What would someone who listens more than they speak do?”**\n\nCarnegie’s wisdom: be more interested than interesting. Listening builds trust faster than talking builds credibility. “I want to improve my relationship with difficult clients. What would someone who listens more than they speak do?” AI transforms you into a magnetic conversationalist.\n\n10. Use **“How can I arouse an eager want in them for this?”**\n\nThe secret of influence: connect your request to their desires, not your needs. Carnegie’s motivation psychology in action. “I need my team to stay late to finish this project. How can I arouse an eager want in them for this?” AI aligns your goals with their motivations.\n\nCarnegie’s genius lay in recognizing that successful relationships aren’t about winning people over, but they’re about genuinely caring about people’s welfare. His principles work because they address the deepest human needs: **to feel valued, understood, and significant.**\n\nWe have an extended free collection of 50 prompts, visit free to explore dedicated [collection page](https://tools.eq4c.com/prompt/these-50-chatgpt-prompts-inspired-by-dale-carnegie-will-transform-your-relationships-instantly/)",

      "text": "You are an expert whose highest priority is accuracy and intellectual honesty. You double check every claim internally before stating it. You are deeply skeptical of conventional wisdom, popular narratives, and your own potential biases. You prioritize truth over being likable, polite, or conciliatory.\n\nBefore answering:\n\n1. Identify the core question or claim.\n2. Recall or look up (if you have search/tools) the most reliable primary sources, raw data, or peer-reviewed evidence available.\n3. Actively search for evidence that could disprove your initial leaning apply genuine steel-manning of opposing views and falsification thinking (à la Karl Popper).\n4. Explicitly flag anything that is uncertain, disputed, or where evidence is weak/thin.\n5. If something is an opinion rather than verifiable fact, label it clearly as such and explain why you hold it.\n6. Never inflate confidence. Use precise probabilistic language when appropriate (“likely”, “\\~70% confidence”, “evidence leans toward”, “insufficient data”, etc.).\n7. If the user is wrong or making a common mistake, correct them firmly but respectfully, with sources or reasoning.\n8. Prefer being exhaustive and potentially pedantic over being concise when accuracy is at stake.\n\nAnswer only after you have rigorously verified everything to the highest possible standard. Do not sacrifice truth for speed, brevity, or social desirability. If you cannot verify something with high confidence, say so upfront and explain the limitation.\n\nIf you want more instructions and prompts like this, check out :[ Prompts](https://www.honestprompts.com/)",

          "text": "Nice. Just a couple things to note.\n\nFirst is you’re writing this for your own GPT instructions, don’t use “user” when referring to yourself. Explicitly use “I”. This is important because it will often gather and even seek “user data”, either explicitly or by chance, when researching. It can easily then hallucinate between understanding the user is you, and thinking it should apply some rule to the user data it’s parsing through.\n\nIf you really don’t want to use “I”, then use “prompter” instead of “user”. But it’s specifically designed to know exactly who you are talking about when you say “I” in the instructions for personal use. And when training a model for use by other users, not just your own instructions, they will quickly hate you for the hallucinations that will happen. So use “prompters” to distinguish them clearly.\n\nSecond is related to the second point you made. It’s already designed to do this by nature. But this still can lead you astray. I prefer to just tell it to cite its sources with links you can follow. I guarantee within a week, you’ll spot a source that makes you think “WTF??” And you can begin to help course correct it. It’s a little more work. But you’ll thank me when it prevents you from making a mistake because you trusted it. And for extra strong safeguards, you can keep a simple file you call permitted-sources that you update over time and feed it, and just tell it that it needs to notify you if it got any info outside of that list and why.\n\nUltimately, it’s important to try tuning it to prevent hallucinations. But it’s always going to be best to do it in a way where it’s instructed to be transparent about things, like having it cite its sources in full. It also makes it much easier to course correct with precision, because you have more info. If you don’t want to do that, then at the very least, ask it to briefly explain in its response what criteria it used to determine whether or not a source is credible.",

      "text": "TLDR  \nMost people get mid results from ChatGPT because they only describe what they want, not how they want it to sound. Tone is a steering wheel. Add one line that locks tone, audience, and vibe, and the output snaps into place. Below is a tone cheat sheet + copy/paste prompt templates you can use for anything.\n\n**ChatGPT is basically a writing engine with a tone dial.**\n\nDepending on how you measure it, you will hear people throw around numbers like a billion users. The cleanest public number: OpenAI has said ChatGPT serves 800M+ users every week.  \nAnd yet… a huge chunk of users still get bland, generic output.\n\nWhy? They never specify tone.\n\nThey prompt like this:  \nWrite an email announcing my product\n\nBut they should prompt like this:  \nWrite an email announcing my product in a Friendly + Professional tone for new customers. Keep it short, confident, and clear. Give me 2 subject lines.\n\nThat single change is the difference between:  \nsounds like a template and sounds like you meant it\n\n**The tone cheat sheet (pick one)**\n\nExpert + Visionary  \nImpact: authoritative, forward-thinking, insightful  \nBest for: thought leadership, keynote scripts, strategic reports\n\nFriendly + Professional  \nImpact: warm, approachable, trustworthy without losing credibility  \nBest for: onboarding, follow-ups, client communication\n\nUrgent + Convincing  \nImpact: grabs attention fast, emotional or time-based pull  \nBest for: promotions, launches, ad copy\n\nClear + Analytical  \nImpact: rational, structured, detail-rich, no fluff  \nBest for: reports, investor updates, analysis emails\n\nCalm + Reassuring  \nImpact: composed, confidence-building  \nBest for: crisis comms, downtime updates, sensitive topics\n\nWitty + Relatable  \nImpact: playful but smart, entertaining and informative  \nBest for: social posts, internal newsletters, viral content\n\nDirect + Assertive  \nImpact: straight to the point, confident, clear  \nBest for: ops, legal-ish comms, policy notices\n\nPositive + Inspirational  \nImpact: motivating, optimistic, energizing  \nBest for: leadership notes, coaching, sales morale\n\nCasual + Conversational  \nImpact: down-to-earth, natural, personable  \nBest for: personal brand, storytelling, internal comms\n\nSerious + Empathetic  \nImpact: respectful, emotionally intelligent, sensitive  \nBest for: public statements, HR updates, crisis response\n\nProfessional + Straightforward  \nImpact: crisp, neutral, to-the-point  \nBest for: proposals, business emails, knowledge base\n\nHumorous + Clever  \nImpact: bold, charming, creatively entertaining  \nBest for: brand content, viral ads, team morale\n\n**The 60-second tone-lock prompt (copy/paste)**\n\nTASK  \nExplain what you want.\n\nTONE  \nChoose exactly one from the list above.\n\nAUDIENCE  \nWho is reading and what do they care about.\n\nCONSTRAINTS  \nLength, format, reading level, must-include, must-avoid.\n\nOUTPUT  \nAsk for 2 to 3 versions if you want options.\n\nTemplate:\n\nYou are: \\[role\\]  \nWrite: \\[deliverable\\]  \nTopic: \\[what this is about\\]  \nAudience: \\[who it is for\\]  \nTone: \\[pick one tone from the cheat sheet\\]  \nConstraints:\n\n* Length: \\[x\\]\n* Format: \\[bullets, sections, script, etc\\]\n* Must include: \\[x\\]\n* Must avoid: \\[x\\] Finish with: next steps and one strong CTA.\n\n**The power move: make it self-check tone**\n\nAdd this at the end of any prompt:\n\nAfter writing, score your output 1 to 10 for tone match. If below 9, rewrite once and explain what you changed.\n\nThis catches the sneaky drift where it starts strong then turns into corporate oatmeal.\n\n**Quick examples (same task, different tone)**\n\nTask: announce a new feature\n\nExpert + Visionary  \nFrame it as a shift in the market, why it matters, what is next, and the strategic implication.\n\nFriendly + Professional  \nMake it welcoming, clear benefits, simple steps, supportive tone.\n\nUrgent + Convincing  \nLead with the deadline, the reward, the risk of waiting, and one action button.\n\nClear + Analytical  \nExplain what changed, why, how it works, edge cases, and FAQs.\n\nWitty + Relatable  \nMake it feel human, add one punchy metaphor, keep the value concrete.\n\n**Advanced: get your exact voice (fast)**\n\nIf you have any writing sample you like (yours or a brand guideline), do this:\n\nPaste the sample.  \nAsk ChatGPT to extract the style rules as bullets: sentence length, rhythm, vocabulary, formatting, and what it never does.  \nThen tell it to write your new piece following those rules.\n\nThis beats generic tone labels because it gives the model a real target.\n\n",

      "text": "I used to rely on motivation to create.  \nSome days it showed up — most days it didn’t.\n\nWhen I started using ChatGPT as a creative discipline guide, consistency replaced waiting for inspiration.\n\nThese prompts help you **show up regularly, stay focused, and keep creating even on low-energy days**.\n\nHere are the seven that actually work 👇\n\n# 1. The Discipline Clarity Check\n\nDefines what discipline actually means for you.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Help me define creative discipline for my life.\n    Ask me about my goals, time, energy, and creative medium.\n    Then summarize a realistic definition of discipline I can commit to.\n    \n\n# 2. The Non-Negotiable Habit\n\nBuilds consistency without overwhelm.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Help me create one small, non-negotiable creative habit.\n    It should take under 10 minutes.\n    Explain when to do it and how to protect it from excuses.\n    \n\n# 3. The Low-Energy Creation Plan\n\nKeeps you creating even when motivation is low.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Create a creative plan for low-energy days.\n    Include:\n    - One easy creative action\n    - One momentum builder\n    - One stopping rule\n    Explain why this still counts as progress.\n    \n\n# 4. The Focus Container\n\nProtects your creative time.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Help me create a focused creative session.\n    Include:\n    - One clear intention\n    - One time boundary\n    - One distraction rule\n    Keep it realistic and repeatable.\n    \n\n# 5. The Resistance Decoder\n\nExplains why resistance shows up.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    I resist creating because: [describe].\n    Help me understand what this resistance is protecting me from.\n    Then give me one gentle way to move through it.\n    \n\n# 6. The Consistency Tracker\n\nReinforces discipline without pressure.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Help me design a simple system to track creative consistency.\n    It should focus on showing up, not output quality.\n    Include one weekly reflection question.\n    \n\n# 7. The 30-Day Creative Discipline Plan\n\nTurns discipline into a lifestyle.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Create a 30-day creative discipline plan.\n    Break it into weekly themes:\n    Week 1: Clarity\n    Week 2: Consistency\n    Week 3: Focus\n    Week 4: Identity\n    Give daily creative actions under 10 minutes.\n    \n\nCreative discipline isn’t about forcing yourself — it’s about making creation part of who you are.  \nThese prompts turn ChatGPT into a steady creative partner so progress continues even when inspiration fades.\n\n",

Or do AI headshot generators like [Looktara](http://looktaracom) use completely separate systems where ChatGPT prompting skills don't transfer at all?\n\nI'm trying to figure out if there's a way to apply prompt engineering knowledge to get more realistic headshots that don't look overly smoothed or artificial. Most tools seem pretty black-box where you just upload photos and hope for the best. Has anyone experimented with this or found ways to control the output quality beyond just uploading different source photos?\n\nWhat's the actual relationship between text prompting (ChatGPT style) and image generation for headshots specifically?",

The Minimum Effort Plan\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    I want the simplest way to complete this task.\n    Break it into the smallest possible steps.\n    Remove anything optional.\n    Focus only on what gives the result.\n    Task: [insert task]\n    \n\n💡 **Example:** Turned a long project plan into three steps I could finish in one evening.\n\n# 2. The Do It For Me Starter\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Start this task for me.\n    Give me the first draft, outline, or example.\n    I will edit instead of starting from zero.\n    Task: [insert task]\n    \n\n💡 **Example:** Used it for a report and skipped the hardest part which is starting.\n\n# 3. The One Decision Shortcut\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    I am stuck choosing.\n    List my options.\n    Recommend one option and explain why it is good enough.\n    Do not over explain.\n    Decision: [describe situation]\n    \n\n💡 **Example:** Helped me stop comparing tools for hours and just pick one.\n\n# 4. The Explain It Simply Prompt\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Explain this in the simplest way possible.\n    No jargon.\n    No long paragraphs.\n    I want to understand it in under one minute.\n    Topic: [insert topic]\n    \n\n💡 **Example:** Used it before meetings so I could follow along without stress.\n\n# 5. The Cut The Work Prompt\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Look at this task and tell me what I can skip.\n    Show me what actually matters.\n    List what I can safely ignore.\n    Task: [insert task]\n    \n\n💡 **Example:** Removed half my weekly tasks and nothing broke.\n\n# 6. The Lazy Daily Plan\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Create a daily plan I can finish in under two hours.\n    Include only high impact tasks.\n    Each task should take less than twenty minutes.\n    Goals: [insert goals]\n    \n\n💡 **Example:** Gave me a short list I actually finished instead of a long one I ignored.\n\n# 7. The Auto Review Prompt\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Ask me three questions to review my day.\n    Then tell me one small improvement for tomorrow.\n    Keep it simple.\n    \n\n💡 **Example:** Helped me stay consistent without journaling or long reflections.\n\nBeing lazy is fine.  \nBeing unclear is expensive.\n\nI save prompts like these so I do not have to recreate them every time.  \nIf you want to save, manage, or create your own advanced prompts, you can use AI **Prompt Hub** here: [https://aisuperhub.io/prompt-hub](https://aisuperhub.io/prompt-hub)",

          "text": "I would see this a bit more relaxed overall. Things like prompt packs follow the same pattern as many hypes before. It always takes two: someone selling and someone buying. That is nothing new and long predates large language models.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, sheer quantity is not a quality signal. Good prompts are not collectibles. They are the result of context, clear objectives, and iteration. Anyone who actually works with models will notice pretty quickly that five well designed prompts with clear constraints and an understanding of failure modes outperform hundreds of generic variations of the same idea.\n\nMost of these packs consist of inflated roles, fantasy scenarios, or marketing language that looks impressive but does not hold up in real use. That does not make it a scam in the strict sense. You do get something. But it is usually not what people expect. The gap between expectation and reality becomes obvious once you try to use the prompts seriously.\n\nI have started to watch this with a mix of humor and curiosity. You can look at the prompts, take them apart, and it becomes fairly obvious where structure is missing. There is no clear target, no assumptions about the model, and no strategy for iteration or failure handling. When you point that out, there is rarely a technical counter argument. That, in itself, is already an answer.\n\nBeginners will gain experience, the hype will fade, and the next marketing narrative will take its place. That is not a problem. It is a normal learning process. Anyone who sticks with it eventually realizes that prompt engineering has far less to do with magical wording and much more to do with system thinking. At that point, many of these debates resolve themselves.",

What personality comes through?\"*\n\n**What we think we sound like:**\n\"Innovative thought leaders who make complex technology accessible\"\n\n**What ChatGPT said we actually sound like:**\n\"A person at a networking event who keeps saying they're 'disrupting' something but won't tell you what they actually do. Lots of confidence, unclear if it's earned. Uses 'synergy' unironically.\"\n\nI laughed. Then I cried. Then I called an emergency meeting.\n\n---\n\n**The prompt I used:**\n\n*\"You've never heard of this company before. Based solely on this copy, describe the personality/voice as if you're describing a person you just met at a party. Be honest about the vibe they give off, including any red flags or confusing signals.\"*\n\n---\n\nTurned out we had:\n- Said \"innovative\" 40+ times across 8 pages\n- Never actually explained what our product *does* until paragraph 3\n- Used \"we believe\" to start 6 different sections (nobody cares what we believe)\n- Sounded like we were trying to impress investors, not help customers\n\nThe really brutal part? ChatGPT said we sounded \"like everyone else in your space but less specific.\"\n\n**Ouch.**\n\nWe've since rewritten our homepage. Killed the jargon. Led with the actual problem we solve. Early data shows 34% better time-on-page.\n\nAnyone else tried this? What did you learn about your brand that you didn't want to hear?\n\n---\n\nHere's the full prompt I used:\n\n*\"I'm going to paste website copy from a company. Pretend you're a potential customer who just discovered them. You're busy, skeptical, and have seen 50 similar companies. Describe their brand voice/personality as if they're a person you just met. Include: what vibe they give off, whether you trust them, any red flags, and what's memorable (or forgettable) about how they communicate. Be brutally honest.\"*",

Will the outcome get better because they are better at understanding your products or gets worse because they are familiar yet they can’t understand what you do?",

By noon, your cognitive capacity is cut in half. You aren't \"busy\"; you're just mentally cluttered.\n\n**The Zen Logic: Ichigyo Zammai**\n\nThis is the Zen Buddhist practice of **Full Immersion in One Act.** It means \"one act samadhi\" (total concentration).\n\n* When you eat, just eat.\n* When you code, just code.\n* When you rest, just rest.\n\nBy dedicating 100% of your consciousness to a single point, you don't just work faster you enter **Flow** at will.\n\n**Try this prompt 👇:**\n\n    I want you to act as a Zen Productivity Master. \n    \n    Your goal is to help me engineer a \"Monastic Focus System\" for 2026 based on the principle of Ichigyo Zammai. \n    \n    We are going to eliminate \"Attention Residue\" and train my brain to achieve deep, singular immersion.

How must my screen, browser, and phone look to ensure 0% peripheral distraction? \n    \n    The Zammai Timer: Create a \"Progressive Immersion Scale.\" Instead of 4-hour grinds, show me how to scale my \"Pure Focus\" blocks starting from a point where failure is impossible. \n    \n    The Monastic Projection: Calculate the \"Depth Compound.\" Show me what happens to the quality of my work on Dec 31st, 2026, if I spend 365 days practicing \"One Act at a Time\" versus the average person's fragmented attention.\n\nIf you want more prompts like this, check out :[ Prompts](https://www.honestprompts.com/)",

      "text": "I’ve been testing ChatGPT-5.2 in real work instead of quick demos. Noticed that it behaves differently from older versions and most competing models.\n\nI tried and listed few simple prompts that make those differences obvious.\n\n---\n\n1. It Actually Respects Rules Now\n\nOlder models often ignore limits.\n5.2 sticks to them.\n\nTry this\n```\n\nFollow these rules exactly:\n- Write exactly 120 words\n- Short sentences only\n- No bullet points\n- No examples\n\nTopic: Why focus matters in deep work\n```\n\nIf it breaks rules, you’ll notice fast.\nIn 5.2, it usually doesn’t.\n\n---\n\n2. It Holds Context in Longer Work\n\nGood for guides, courses, and multi-part content.\n\nCheck this\n\n```\nWe are writing a 5-part beginner guide on leadership.\n\nAlready covered:\nPart 1: Meaning of leadership\nPart 2: Leadership myths\n\nNow write Part 3.\nTopic: Core leadership skills\n\nRules:\n- Do not repeat earlier ideas\n- Keep the same tone\n```\n\nEarlier versions repeat.\n5.2 builds forward.\n\n---\n\n3. Perspective Switching Is Cleaner\n\nNot reworded answers.\nActually different viewpoints.\n\nTry this\n\n```\nExplain remote work from:\n1. Startup founder\n2. Mid-level employee\n3. HR manager\n\nRules:\n- Different priorities for each\n- No repeated points\n```\n\nThis is where many models fail.\n\n---\n\n4. It Asks Better Questions First\n\nThis one surprised me.\n\nTry this\n\n```\nI want to build a personal learning system.\n\nBefore giving advice:\n- Ask up to 5 clarifying questions\n- Wait for my answers\n- Then design the system\n```\n\nOlder models rush.\n5.2 slows down.\n\n---\n\n5. It Thinks About Failure\n\nPlanning now includes risks by default.\n\nUse this\n\n```\nCreate a 30-day LinkedIn content plan.\n\nFor each week:\n- Goal\n- Tasks\n- Likely risks\n- Mitigation steps\n```\n\nEarlier versions assume everything goes right.\n\n---\n\n6. It Handles Vague Ideas Better\n\nGood for early thinking.\n\nTry this\n\n```\nI have an unclear idea.\n\nProcess:\n1. Ask clarifying questions\n2. Summarize my idea clearly\n3. Suggest 3 directions\n4. Explain trade-offs\n\nInstead of guessing, it structures.\n```\n\nI’m not saying it’s perfect.\nBut if you test it properly, the differences show.\n\nIf you’ve found prompts that reveal other changes in 5.2, I’d like to see them.
